    "recently , exotic structures of the be isotopes have been theoretically and experimentally studied , and many new phenomena have been discussed @xcite .",
    "one of them is the appearance of the cluster rotational band structure in the excited states of @xmath0be ( @xmath1+@xmath15he)@xcite and @xmath16be ( @xmath1+@xmath17he , @xmath15he+@xmath15he)@xcite .",
    "we have suggested @xcite , based on the molecular - orbit ( mo ) model , that the development of @xmath1-@xmath1 cluster structure depends on the neutron orbits located around the core comprised of @xmath1-clusters . in the second @xmath18 state of @xmath0be",
    ", an anomalously prolonged @xmath1-@xmath1 clustering structure emerges due to the valence neutrons located along the @xmath1-@xmath1 axis@xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0be has been known to have a strong @xmath19 deformation due to the @xmath1-@xmath1 core . in this paper",
    ", we discuss another aspect , a triaxial deformation .",
    "the triaxial deformation is possible as a result of the dynamics of the two valence neutrons .",
    "the triaxiality of @xmath0be has been theoretically discussed based on the deformed oscillator model @xcite , in which a @xmath20 distortion of 34.8@xmath21 has been predicted . according to davydov - filippov model@xcite",
    ", this @xmath20 value suggests that the excitation energy of the second @xmath22 state is 2.3 times higher than that of the first @xmath22 state . in @xmath0be , the first @xmath22 state",
    "is observed at 3.358 mev , and several @xmath22 states have been observed around 8 mev region .",
    "because of the presence of the @xmath22 states in this energy region , recently , an experimental study has been performed in order to identify a triaxial structure of @xmath0be@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the triaxiality of @xmath0be as a composite system of the @xmath1-@xmath1 core and two valence neutrons , comparing with other theoretical models . in our previous study on @xmath0be@xcite ,",
    "all of the observed low - lying positive- and negative - parity states are explained as combinations of three basic orbits ( @xmath6 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) of two valence neutrons around the two @xmath1-clusters . here",
    ", the @xmath25-axis is taken to be the axis connecting two @xmath1-clusters .",
    "if we adopt @xmath6 or @xmath24 orbits for the two valence neutrons , there appear two rotational bands in low energy ; one is dominated by the @xmath26 intrinsic structure and the other by @xmath27 .",
    "the calculated two @xmath22 states of these bands can be related to the observed first @xmath22 state at 3.358 mev and the second @xmath22 state at 5.958 mev .",
    "it is therefore important to show how the triaxial intrinsic configuration emerges in these states , and how the orbits of the valence neutrons deviate from the axial symmetry . here , we calculate the electro - magnetic transition between these @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands ( b(e2 : @xmath28 ) ) as a signal of a triaxial deformation .",
    "this transition is suppressed when the orbitals are of pure axial symmetry .",
    "however , the orbitals may deviate from the axial symmetry , when the valence neutrons are mutually more correlated and form a localized di - neutron pair due to the neutron - neutron interaction .",
    "the recoil effect of the valence neutrons with respect to the @xmath1-@xmath1 core then plays a role to break the axial symmetry of the charge distribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a description of the single - particle orbits around the two @xmath1-clusters based on mo . in section iii , we show our results on @xmath0be , and a conclusion is given in section iv .",
    "we introduce a microscopic @xmath1+@xmath1+@xmath29 model for @xmath0be .",
    "the neutron configurations are introduced based on the molecular orbit ( mo ) picture@xcite .",
    "the total wave function is fully antisymmetrized and expressed as a superposition of slater determinants with various configurations of the valence neutrons .",
    "the slater determinants are also superposed with respect to different relative distances between the two @xmath1 clusters ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the projection to the eigen states of angular momentum @xmath31 is numerically performed .",
    "all nucleons are described by gaussians with a common oscillator parameter @xmath32 set equal to 1.46 fm .",
    "the @xmath1 cluster located at @xmath33 on the @xmath25-axis contains four nucleons .",
    "@xmath34 here , @xmath35 represents a gaussian : @xmath36 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\nu=1/2s^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the unit vector pointing the @xmath25-direction .",
    "the actual value of @xmath33 is @xmath39 or @xmath40 in this work .",
    "the wave function of the @xmath41th valence neutron ( @xmath42 ) is expressed by a linear combination of local gaussians : @xmath43 @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a parameter corresponding to the gaussian center .",
    "the two valence neutrons are classified according to the mo picture . in the mo model",
    ", the states of the valence neutrons are expressed by a linear combination of orbits around two @xmath1 clusters . here",
    ", we notice that the valence neutrons and the neutrons in the @xmath1 clusters are identical particles , and the valence neutrons must be orthogonal to the forbidden space due to the @xmath1-@xmath1 core .",
    "the lowest orbit then has one node and negative parity , that is the @xmath46-orbit .",
    "we take the harmonic - oscillator - type wave function for the @xmath46-orbit .",
    "such @xmath46-orbits in the @xmath47- , @xmath48- , and @xmath25-direction are denoted as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively .",

    "now we construct mo from these @xmath46-orbits .",
    "since each valence neutron can move around one of the two @xmath1-clusters , there should be two sets of the @xmath46-orbits defined with respect to those two @xmath1-clusters .",
    "thus , the @xmath58 orbit whose center is shifted at @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) on the @xmath25-axis is denoted as @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . as linear combinations of these orbits ,",
    "the lowest mos are expressed as : @xmath63 @xmath64 these orbits clearly have @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . in these cases ,",
    "the classical picture of @xmath46-orbit is a circular motion about the @xmath1-@xmath1 @xmath67 axis .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath3-orbit .",
    "if we take a linear combination of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the orbit becomes the so - called @xmath70-orbit , just along the @xmath1-@xmath1 ( @xmath25 ) axis .",
    "this orbit is a higher - nordal orbit and only relevant to the second @xmath18 state , discussed also in antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations@xcite and in stochastic variational method ( svm ) calculations@xcite , and now we disregard this orbit .    these @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 orbits can be approximated by a combination of two local gaussians , whose centers are shifted by a variational parameter @xmath75 perpendicular to the @xmath25-axis .",
    "we thus use the following wave functions , @xmath76 the values of these parameters @xmath77 and @xmath75 are variationally determined by using the cooling method in amd @xcite independently for each @xmath1-@xmath1 distance . since the rotational symmetry about the @xmath25-axis is broken with eq .

    "the hamiltonian consists of the kinetic energy term , the central two - body interaction term , the two - body spin - orbit interaction term , and the coulomb interaction term : @xmath85 the effective nucleon - nucleon interactions are volkov no.2@xcite for the central part and the g3rs spin - orbit term@xcite for the spin - orbit part , as follows : @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a projection operator onto the triplet odd state , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 operators represent the relative angular momentum and total spin of the interacting two nucleons , respectively .",

    "we employ the majorana exchange parameter @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , the bartlett exchange parameter @xmath101 and the heisenberg exchange parameter @xmath102 for the volkov interaction ( using @xmath103 and @xmath104 , there is no neutron - neutron bound state ) .",
    "all these parameters are determined from @xmath105 and @xmath106 scattering phase shifts and the binding energy of the deuteron@xcite .      for @xmath0be",
    ", we introduce three configurations of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 for the two valence neutrons , and mixing amplitude of these configurations are variationally determined after the angular momentum projection .",
    "it will be shown that the @xmath107 configuration , where valence neutrons occupy orbits with @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the main component of the ground state .",
    "the energy shift due to the spin - orbit interaction acting effectively on a valence neutron is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "it is , therefore , favored that the orbital part and the spin part of @xmath113 are coupled to be parallel .",
    "this means that the spin - up valence neutron ( @xmath114 ) has @xmath115 , while the spin - down valence neutron ( @xmath116 ) @xmath117 , giving rise to the wave function of the two valence neutrons : @xmath118,\\ ] ] with @xmath119    we also introduce a basis state @xmath108 , which the spin - orbit interaction does not favor .",

    "however , each component has a significant dependence . in table iii , proton - orbital part and neutron - spin part",
    "are also listed ( neutron - orbital part is of course zero , and proton - spin part also becomes zero due to the assumption of the @xmath1-clusters ) .    as for the proton - orbital part , using the original interaction @xmath191 mev , @xmath99 ) , @xmath152 is calculated to have a larger value than @xmath158 : the @xmath152 state has 1.13 @xmath192 and the @xmath158 state has 0.46 @xmath192 .",
    "the @xmath152 state is mainly of @xmath26 , and therefore the rotation of the @xmath1-@xmath1 core is the main source of the angular momentum ( @xmath193 ) .",

    "these values depend on the strength of the spin - orbit interaction . with decreasing spin - orbit strength , the difference of proton - orbital part between these two states becomes smaller due to the increase of the @xmath8-mixing effect between the two @xmath22 configurations , which we discussed .",

    "if we restrict the model space to @xmath201 , then the b(e2 : @xmath202 ) becomes 14.7 @xmath155@xmath156 , and the ratio @xmath205 of 1.18 becomes closer to 1.43 . in nuclear @xmath182 model , the @xmath139 states with @xmath26 @xmath206 and @xmath27 @xmath207 become the same representation .",
    "this character partially remains as a strong @xmath8-mixing effect in the present mo model .",
    "we have applied the @xmath1+@xmath1+@xmath2+@xmath2 model to @xmath0be and discussed the triaxial deformation of this nucleus .",
    "the orbits for the valence neutrons have been introduced based on the molecular orbit ( mo ) model . in the present model ,",
    "the spatially extended motion of the valence neutrons around the @xmath1-clusters are described by linear combinations of gaussians , and the centers of the gaussians are variationally determined .",
    "the calculated energy levels show the appearance of two band structures , which have dominantly @xmath201 and @xmath208 components , when the two valence neutrons occupy @xmath6 or @xmath7 orbits .",
    "the first @xmath22 state has the squared overlap with the @xmath201 state by 0.96 , and the second @xmath22 state has the squared overlap with the @xmath208 state by 0.92 .",
    "since the second @xmath22 state has the component of @xmath201 by 8@xmath151 , the electro - magnetic transition from the @xmath152 state ( mainly @xmath26 ) to the @xmath158 state ( mainly @xmath27 ) is allowed ( 3.99 @xmath155@xmath156 ) . using davydov - filippov model@xcite , we estimated the triaxiality for the @xmath22 state .",
    "the ratio @xmath209 calculated with the davidov - filippov model and our model coincide around @xmath163 , and b(e2 ) ratio @xmath164 indicates @xmath165 17@xmath21 @xmath128 22@xmath21 .",
    "originally , the @xmath1-@xmath1 core is introduced to be of axial symmetry . however , because of the recoil effect of the valence neutrons , the charge distribution deviates from the axial symmetry , and the system becomes triaxial .",
    "we also discussed the triaxial deformation by artificially weakening the spin - orbit interaction . with decreasing spin - orbit interaction , the orbits of the valence neutrons",
    "deviate from the @xmath181-coupling limit , and the di - neutron configuration becomes important . here",
    ", the system becomes 3 body - like and the @xmath210 value drastically increases .    similar di - neutron component is discussed in weakly bound systems with the so - called halo structure .",
    "for example , in @xmath15he , in addition to the shell model - like space , the model space of di - neutron+@xmath211he has been shown to be important @xcite .",
    "this means that a locally - correlated di - neutron wave function is important for the description of the valence neutrons with small binding energy and spatially extended distribution .",
    "it is consistent with our discussion on the effect of varying the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "namely , when the valence neutrons with low - binding energies have halo structure , the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction between the core and the valence neutrons becomes weak . here , the valence neutrons construct a di - neutron pair with spin singlet , by which they can increase the spatial overlap between them and the contribution of the attractive interaction .",
    "therefore , it is very challenging to explore the triaxial deformations in @xmath16be and @xmath212be , which have weakly bound neutrons and also deformed cores .",
