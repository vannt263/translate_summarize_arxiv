    "the dirac equation in a gravitational field of general form was derived by fock and iwanenko in 1929 @xcite using the formalism of parallel spinor transport , which allowed its covariant derivative to be determined .",
    "another method for deriving the dirac equation in a gravitational field is based on the description of the lorentz group in tetrad formalism @xcite . the dirac equation written in a ( pseudo-)riemannian space is @xmath0 where the dirac matrices in a metric of general form @xmath1 are expressed in terms of the standard matrices @xmath2 in a minkowski space via the tetrad @xmath3 .",
    "the extended derivative is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the electromagnetic 4-potential .",
    "the dirac equation in gravitational fields of various forms was investigated in many papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the scattering of fermions by black holes and the emission of fermions in the process of quantum black hole evaporation ( the hawking effect ) were studied most extensively .",
    "most of the efforts at investigating the dirac equation in a gravitational field were focused on problems of this type .",
    "the resonant quasistationary quantum states of scalar particles in the gravitational field of a black hole were investigated in @xcite .",
    "similar quantum states for spinor particles were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the stationary states of charged particles were studied in the gravitational field of a schwarzschild black hole @xcite , @xcite and an electrically charged reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite in a region outside the horizon .",
    "the spacetime of an eternal reissner - nordstrm black hole is an infinite sequence of internal universes @xcite .",
    "a particle falling into an eternal reissner - nordstrm black hole can either escape into another internal universe or be left below the cauchy horizon .",
    "the existence of stable finite orbits for classical particles below the cauchy horizon was shown in @xcite .    here , we consider the stationary quantum states of fermions inside and outside a black hole and show that such states and the corresponding energy levels actually exist under certain conditions .",
    "a reissner - nordstrm black hole with a charged particle at a quantum level in some respect resembles the simplest hydrogen atom .",
    "however , in the case of a charged black hole , the electron levels can be not only outside but also inside the black hole , below the cauchy horizon .",
    "in addition , the boundary conditions for the wave functions on the black hole horizon are distinctly different , which changes qualitatively the energy level characteristics for stationary states .",
    "the existence of energy levels inside a black hole opens up the fundamental new possibility of `` looking '' into the black hole using quantum methods , which is impossible within the framework of classical general relativity .",
    "more specifically , if there exist energy levels inside a black hole , then the internal structure of black holes can be studied based on the spectrum of transitions between external and internal levels .",
    "the ultimate fate of black holes evaporating in the hawking process has not yet been clarified , in particular , because large deviations from predictions of the classical gravitation theory are probable as the black hole mass approaches the planck mass @xmath7  g. the various effects that could stabilize an evaporating primordial black hole near the mass@xmath8 were discussed ( for an overview of the models , see @xcite ) .",
    "these remnants of evaporating black holes , called `` planckions '' , were proposed as candidate dark matter ( hidden mass ) particles in the universe @xcite , @xcite .",
    "black holes of such masses should have distinct quantum properties and , therefore , the quantum states of particles we discuss can play a prominent role in the properties of these black holes , in particular , they can change the probability of their quantum decay or final evaporation .",
    "previously , markov discussed the so - called maximons , semi - closed worlds that are particle - like charged solutions in general relativity @xcite . here , we show that a new type of systems remotely resembling maximons , charged black holes with charges on inner quantum orbits , can exist .",
    "these systems can also represent dark matter if they are stable and were born in sufficient quantities at early cosmological epochs .",
    "although eternal black holes with internal spaces are probably not formed through classical gravitational collapse , they can emerge in quantum processes during particle collisions on accelerators ( experiments on the large hadron collider have already tested some of such models ) or when ultrahigh - energy cosmic ray particles interact with the atmosphere ( these interactions are observed experimentally on several detectors ) if the theories with extra space dimensions are realized @xcite .",
    "since such mini - black holes are formed in processes involving charged particles , it is natural to expect the birth of not neutral but charged reissner - nordstrm black holes with various configurations of charges on orbits inside and outside these black holes . in this case ,",
    "not the gradual collapse of matter and the capture of particles into a black hole but the instantaneous quantum birth of systems with an internal structure will occur .",
    "let us briefly describe the method of separation of variables in the dirac equation @xcite as applied to a reissner - nordstrm black hole with the metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath11 is its charge , and @xmath12 .",

    "similar to the previous case , it is proven that for a regular solution @xmath121 equations ( [ itogeq1exin ] ) and ( [ itogeq2exin ] ) when @xmath91 then have asymptotic solutions , @xmath122 the solutions with @xmath123 are physical , because the part of the solution at @xmath124 makes a diverging contribution to ( 12 ) , similar to the case with non - extremal black holes considered above . then , @xmath125 the contribution from ( [ hc11 ] ) to ( [ normint ] ) is finite under the condition @xmath126 , which can be rewritten as @xmath127 hence it follows that the state with @xmath46 is forbidden if @xmath128 . in view of the pauli exclusion principle ,",

    "for ordinary particles , such as the proton or electron , this equality , of course , does not hold . for them , @xmath139 , but the concept of extremality itself loses its meaning due to the contribution of quantum effects .",

    "the existence of only one level is attributable to the properties of the wave equation when the cauchy horizon is approached from the inside .",
    "there is also only one regular level with energy @xmath142 outside the event horizon and the solution at infinity corresponds to that for the hydrogen atom .",
    "however , the probability integral turned out to diverge on the horizons @xmath143 and , therefore , the wave functions can not be normalized to unity .",
    "this may imply that the real solution tends to the stationary solutions found only asymptotically , while the particle tends to be localized on the horizons .",
    "if quantum tunneling is disregarded , then , as is well known , the falling of a particle below the horizon , according to the clocks of a remote observer , will take an infinitely long time .",
    "accordingly , the particle localization on the horizon will occur only asymptotically on long time scales . in the extremal case of @xmath18 ,",
    "the energies of the internal and external levels take on identical values of@xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the radius of the extremal black hole horizon .",
    "in contrast to the case of a non - extremal black hole , at @xmath18 a physically acceptable solution with normalized wave functions exists both inside ( below the cauchy horizon ) and outside the black hole .",
    "the stationary solutions of the dirac equation we considered show that black holes with charges on inner quantum orbits can exist .",
    "an alternative possibility is a naked singularity around which charge is distribution in the stationary case @xcite .",
    "if @xmath146 , where @xmath141 is the total charge of the particles at quantum levels , then the external metric of such a system is the schwarzschild one . for an external observer , the system is neutral and interacts weakly with the surrounding matter .",
    "if , in addition , such systems are stable ( which requires an additional study ) and were born effectively in the early universe , then they could be candidates for dark matter particles .",
    "vronsky @xcite considered a dirac particle outside the horizon of a neutral schwarzschild black hole and also came up with the idea of such systems as dark matter particles .",
    "however , if the black hole is neutral and the particle is charged , then the system carries a nonzero total electric charge and will interact via this charge with the surrounding matter . in the case of a reissner - nordstrm black hole with @xmath146 , the corresponding candidate dark matter particles are electrically neutral and",
    "interact very weakly .",
    "if the black hole has internal and external energy levels , then quantum transitions between these levels are possible .",
    "this allows the charge falling into a reissner - nordstrm black hole to linger at a quantum level below the cauchy horizon and probably to tunnel outward or into the internal universe .",
    "the quantum transition of a particle from the external stationary energy level ( [ energyout ] ) to the corresponding internal level ( [ energy ] ) may be considered as an analog of the classical fall of a particle into a black hole .",
    "since the energies at the external and internal levels for an extremal black hole are equal , no energy is released during the quantum transition . in the case of a non - extremal black hole ,",
    "energy can be released during the transitions between quasi - stationary levels : @xmath147 where we restored the physical dimensions of the quantities in the last equality .",
    "we see that much energy can be radiated during such transitions for @xmath148 .",
    "if the systems under consideration are dark matduce highly energetic particles that may contribute to the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays .",
    "there will be no such energy release for an extremal black hole , because @xmath149 .",
    "these transitions may turn out to be fundamentally important at the final stage of hawking black hole evaporation , because they affect the phase volumes of the final and intermediate states of the particles produced during evaporation .",
    "the existence of the quantum levels we detected is a necessary condition for these quantum transitions , but the possibility of such transitions itself , of course , requires an additional study and justification . the transitions between levels , including those through the horizon , can occur via quantum tunneling with a probability proportional to @xmath150 , where the action @xmath151 is calculated along a semiclassical trajectory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note also the fundamental possibility of investigating the internal structure of black holes using quantum tunneling between external and internal states ."
