    "the pion electromagnetic ( em ) form factor is of great interest for the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . at low momentum transfers ( @xmath0 ) nonperturbative qcd ( npqcd )",
    "dominates , while at large @xmath0 perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) can be used to calculate the asymptotic form factor ; and the transition from npqcd to pqcd has long been of interest  @xcite . since pqcd can only be used for @xmath1 1 gev@xmath2 , light - front ( lf ) quantization methods may be most useful  @xcite . in the early work on the pion form factor@xcite using the light - front bethe - salpeter equation ( lfbse)@xcite the npqcd (",
    "soft ) part was separated from the pqcd ( hard ) part ; and it was shown in a model calculation that the transition from npqcd to pqcd is expected in the region 5.0 @xmath3 gev@xmath2 .",
    "this work was extended@xcite to include the sudakov form factor  @xcite , anomalous quark magnetic dipole moments , and a simple model for the running quark mass , @xmath4 .",
    "improved calculations of the pion em form factor are motivated by the recent new and upgraded data ( up to @xmath0=1.6 gev ) from the jefferson laboratory(jlab )  @xcite .",
    "while this @xmath0 range may be too low to determine the transition to the pqcd region , these data are useful for studying npqcd theoretical approaches . in the present work we restrict ourselves to the soft npqcd part with models for the running mass that ensure gauge invariance and consistency with the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) relation  @xcite [ pcac ] m^2_f_=-2m_()0||q_5 q|_()= -2 m _ ( ) , where @xmath5=@xmath6(current mass ) in spacelike @xmath7=@xmath8 region(@xmath9 is the renormlization point ) and @xmath10 is the quark condensate .",
    "since we are only considering the soft part of the pion form factor here , the lfbs amplitude can be modeled by a light - front wave function  @xcite based on lf hamiltonian dynamics , such as the light - front constituent quark model(lfcqm )  @xcite , but an essential ingredient is the use of a running quark mass , which is the main subject of the present paper . in lf quantization , a possible connection is anticipated between the constituent quark model(cqm ) and qcd due to the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation that leads to a relatively simple vacuum structure . there is no spontaneous creation of massive fermions in the lf quantized vacuum .",
    "thus , one can immediately obtain a constituent - type picture , in which all partons in a hadronic state are connected directly to the hadron instead of being simply disconnected excitations ( or vacuum fluctuations ) in a complicated medium .",
    "in particular , a systematic program has been laid out in the calculation of the spacelike em form factor of pseudoscalar mesons because only parton - number - conserving fock state ( valence ) contribution is needed when the  good \" components of the current , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are used in the drell - yan - west(@xmath13=0 ) frame  @xcite .",
    "the new data from the jlab  @xcite seem to be in good agreement with the previous cqm result  @xcite based on a qcd - motivated linear confining potential .",
    "however , a possible realization of chiral symmetry breaking in the lf vacuum is an underdeveloped aspect of lf quantization .",
    "in contrast to quark models or lfcqm which use a phenomenological constant constituent quark mass , an approach based on qcd quantum field theory is the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in conjuncton with dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations for the quark propagators , gluon propagator and vertices .",
    "we note an important result of recent ds calculations , in which the effective running mass , @xmath14 , is calculated@xcite . in these ds calculations",
    "the parameters for model gluon propagators are fixed by fitting the quark condensate , the mixed condensate and even the form of the nonlocal condensate@xcite .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that the ds quark propagator with running masses that decrease with respect to @xmath7 faster than quark models gives properties of the rho@xcite and pion@xcite that are in agreement with experiment . in all of these ds calculations",
    "it has been found that the effective quark mass drops very rapidly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "since the covariant bs / ds approach and the lf approach are not same but complementary , it may be necessary to examine if the previous lfcqm result  @xcite is intact even if the quark mass evolves as rapid as bs / ds approach found .",
    "this is a strong motivation for reformulating the lfcqm with a running quark mass , which we do in the present work .    in the present work",
    ", we analyze the effect of the mass evolution ( from constituent to current quark mass ) on the elastic pion form factor at low and intermediate @xmath0 . a correct theoretical approach to such",
    "a study is the lfbse coupled to lfds equatons . from the lfds equations",
    "the running quark mass is obtained from the dressed quark propagator .",
    "although the lfds equation has recently been developed  @xcite , only simple model solutions are available , and here we use a parameterization of the running quark mass that is consistent with known observations .",
    "while the asymptotic behavior of the running mass might require the crossing symmetry(under @xmath15 ) at high momentum @xmath0 analogous to that of pion form factor , there is no clue yet for the small momentum behavior in timelike region .",
    "thus , we present the two different forms of mass evolution function ; one is crossing asymmetric and the other is crossing symmetric .",
    "we then compare the results for the two cases .",
    "it should be noted that the recent lfds results@xcite also show a rapid decrease of effective quark mass with momentum that puts the use of quark models for calculating any but static properties in question . in the present work we use forms for the quark mass evolution that are consistent with conventional quark models for calculating hadronic properties at momentum transfers less than about 800 mev .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we review the formulation that underlies a description of the elastic pion form factor within a modeling of qcd through the lfbse , which is a lfqm with a running mass . in sec .",
    "iii , we formulate the running quark mass in lf framework and discuss the local gauge invariance at the quark - photon vertex , i.e. ward - takahashi identity  @xcite , due to the momentum dependent quark propagator . in sec .",
    "iv , we analyze the running mass effect on the pion form factor , charge radius , and decay constant obtained from the previous cqm  @xcite calculation . we also show that our model with the running quark mass is consistent with the pcac relation given by eq .",
    "( [ pcac ] ) .",
    "this simply means that we obtain a quark condensate consistent with the phenomenological value given in eq .",
    "( [ pcac ] ) , which is true in the ds calculations@xcite .",
    "a conclusion follows in sec . v.",
    "the lfbse introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite has the form [ lfbs ] ( x,*k*_)&=&(y,*l * _ ) , where @xmath16 is the gluon exchange kernel and @xmath17 , the difference between the complete bs kernel and @xmath16 , includes all confining effects .",
    "these kernels were obtained from the relativistic string and lf perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , respectively . since npqcd has not yet provided a form for the confining kernel , in ref .",
    "@xcite the problem of solving for the complete bs amplitude , @xmath18 , was avoided by using a model for the soft amplitude .",
    "i.e. , the soft bs amplitude , @xmath19 , can be considered to be the solution of the equation [ bs_sf ] ^s(x,*k*_)_c(x,*k*_;y,*l * _ ) ^s(y,*l * _ ) .",
    "iterating eq .",
    "( [ lfbs ] ) by inserting @xmath20 for @xmath21 , one obtains the approximate form [ lfbs2 ] ( x,*k * _ ) & & ^s(x,*k * _ ) + & & + _ g(x,*k*_;y,*l * _ ) ^s(y,*l * _ ) .",
    "this bs amplitude contains both soft and hard ingredients needed to take care of momentum transfer for all @xmath0 therefore is correctly characterized as including both confinement and asymptotic features of a composite quark system .",
    "this approach to the pion form factor has been shown  @xcite to be in good agreement with the direct bs calculation  @xcite , and to converge rapidly .",
    "the extension of eq .",
    "( [ bs_sf ] ) to the non - wave - function vertex in the particle - number - nonconserving fock state contribution has recently been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one nice feature of this approach is that one determines the soft part and the hard part separately , so that one can determine the transition from soft to hard qcd within this lfbs approach",
    ". this will be the subject of our future work .",
    "for the present work of low- and medium-@xmath0 , we only consider the confining part of the bs amplitude .",
    "we thus may be able to use the lfcqm , which has inlcuded many important properties of the @xmath0 range that we focus in this work .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this work we use the lf wave function for the lfbs amplitude .",
    "the elastic pion form factor is related to pion em current by the following equation [ current ] p|j^(0)|p= ( p + p)^f_(q^2 ) . as usual , our calculation will be carried out using the @xmath22 frame where @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 is spacelike momentum transfer .",
