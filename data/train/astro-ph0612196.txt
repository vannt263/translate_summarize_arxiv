    ", it does not depend on the cosmological parameters , so the constraint on the property of de at low redshift from sn ia data is not strong ; ( 2 ) at high redshift , the role of de diminishes . depending on the model ,",

    ", we have @xmath9 for the model @xmath135 and @xmath10 for the @xmath11cdm model .",
    "it should be stressed that the effect of the heterogeneous nature of the gold sn ia data on the systematics is also important and it may impose potential problem when combining with wmap3 data @xcite .",
