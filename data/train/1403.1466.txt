    "since the early days of quantum mechanics there has been an interest in accurately describing the kinetic energy ( ke ) of a system of non - interacting fermions given the particle density .",
    "such descriptions have been paramount in the development of schemes for computations of physical properties of atoms , molecules and solids which are in ubiquitous use today across disciplines .",
    "the derivation and evaluation of approximate expressions of the kinetic energy is still an active area of research with applications in , e.g. , orbital - free ( of ) density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , high - temperature applications of dft , and as an intermediate step in developing improved approximations for the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "applications are also found in the field of nuclear dft @xcite and trapped degenerate fermion gases@xcite .",
    "a common starting point for most approximations of the ke is thomas - fermi ( tf ) theory @xcite , which is exact for a uniform electron gas .",
    "a number of historically important works have derived corrections to tf for a weakly inhomogeneous electron system as an expansion in gradients of the electron density @xcite , and we will refer to this as the extended tf ( etf ) gradient expansion ( ge ) . however , it has also been noted that for systems with surface regions , i.e. , regions where the electron density drops to zero , the etf ge of the kinetic energy density is not valid and further corrections of the same order in the density and density gradient are necessary ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein for an extended discussion . ) despite a frequent appeal to tf and etf theory in the literature , the need for such corrections is rarely discussed .    in the present paper",
    "we utilize a closed form expression of the non - interacting ke of the airy gas ( ag ) surface model system @xcite to derive a modified etf ge that includes the quantum corrections .",
    "when applying the obtained expression to other model systems with electron surfaces , e.g. , the jellium surface model , hydrogen - like potentials , and a system confined by an isotropic harmonic potential , we find these quantum corrections to provide a crucial correction to the local description of the kinetic energy density . however , for two other systems that we investigate , i.e. , a system with a cosine potential , and a system confined by an harmonic potential in only one dimension , we find that neither of the two expansions holds unreservedly .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we summarize the important equations for the kinetic energy , the edge electron gas class of model systems and the airy gas model . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the central expression of the work , a gradient expansion of the kinetic energy density which includes the quantum corrections from the airy gas surface . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the universality of the obtained expressions in a range of numerical tests . in sec .",
    "v we discuss our findings . finally , sec .",
    "vi presents a summary and the main conclusions of this work .",
    "our primary interest for the ke of non - interacting fermions is due to its central importance in kohn - sham ( ks ) dft @xcite , and thus we will adopt the relevant terminology from this field . hence , consider a system of @xmath0 non - interacting fermions with ground state particle density @xmath1 which we assume to be continuous everywhere .",
    "the ke is given exactly in hartree atomic units by the functional @xmath2= -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\nu : \\epsilon_{\\nu } \\leq \\mu } \\int \\psi_{\\nu}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{r } ) \\nabla^2 \\psi_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{r } ) d^3\\boldsymbol{r},\\ ] ] where @xmath3 indexes available states including the spin degree of freedom , @xmath4 is the self - consistent chemical potential and @xmath5 are the ks orbitals with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath6 .",
    "the ks - orbitals are formally functionals of @xmath7 , making eq .",
    "( [ eq : ts ] ) an implicit functional . equation ( [ eq : ts ] ) directly defines one possible kinetic energy density ( ked ) as @xmath8 the ked is only unique up to a term that integrates to zero over the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ts ] ) . in a closed or periodic system ,",
    "gauss divergence theorem applied to @xmath9 gives that the laplacian of the electron density @xmath10 integrates to zero .",
    "this can be exploited to construct the following alternative ked which is positive at all points in space @xmath11 this choice of ked is advantageous for developing approximations , since an approximation that fulfills the constraint @xmath12 will avoid the unphysical result @xmath13 for all @xmath7 .",
    "we stress that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pos_ked ] ) is taken as a definition , which makes @xmath14 valid without ambiguity even for open non - periodic systems . however , the caveat for such systems is that @xmath14 is then not strictly a ked , since integration will not give @xmath15 ( one would instead need to integrate @xmath16 . )    a starting point for many approximations of @xmath14 is the tf approximation , @xmath17 = c_{\\mathrm{tf } } n^{\\frac{5}{3}}(\\boldsymbol{r}),\\ ] ] with @xmath18 .",
    "based on the scaling relation of the total non - interacting kinetic energy @xcite one can assume @xmath14 to be homogeneous of degree @xmath19 under uniform coordinate scaling @xcite .",
    "hence , a ( semi-)local density - functional approximation ( dfa ) of the ked takes the form @xmath20 = \\tau^{\\mathrm{tf}}[n ] f^{\\mathrm{dfa}}_{\\tau}(s , q , \\ldots),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the refinement factor , and the scaled gradient @xmath22 and laplacian @xmath23 are @xmath24 we define as a _ limit of slowly varying density _ any limit where @xmath25 and all higher order terms @xmath26 .",
    "early efforts to find improved approximations of @xmath14 date back to 1935 , when von weizscker@xcite derived a ked approximation with @xmath27 . in 1957",
    "kirzhnits @xcite used commutator operator formalism to derive gradient corrections to tf theory in the limit of a weakly perturbed uniform electron gas . a number of extensions to the original result have followed .",
    "hohenberg and kohn@xcite developed a density gradient technique based on linear response formalism .",
    "an expansion in @xmath28 of the green s function representation due to wigner and kirkwood has also been calculated@xcite . in a paper by yang , corrections are derived in terms of the green s function from the first - order reduced density matrix@xcite . from these past works",
    "it is well established that the etf gradient correction to tf , i.e. , the gradient corrections for the slowly varying limit of a weakly perturbed uniform electron gas , are to second order @xmath29    however , as explained in the introduction , it has been observed that the etf expansion does not apply universally to regions of slowly varying electron density in a system that is not a weakly perturbed uniform electron gas , but rather has surface regions , i.e. , regions where the electron density drops to zero ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the main idea put forward in this paper is to derive explicit corrections from a surface model system ( the ag ) and investigate how general the resulting expression is when applied to other model systems .",
    "we note that the kinetic energy of the ag model and related systems have been discussed in other recent works .",
    "_ @xcite and constantin and ruzsinszky@xcite have both presented ked functionals based on parameterizations of the ag ked .",
    "both works discuss the role of the laplacian term in achieving an optimal local description of the ked across the surface .",
    "constantin and ruzsinszky specifically enforce the etf ge in the limit of slowly varying density .",
    "in contrast , in the present work our focus is the exact behavior in the limit of slowly varying electron density far inside the surface .",
    "the derivations in the present work start from the formalism and results by kohn and mattsson @xcite , which are outlined in the following .",
    "we start from the general model system of an edge electron gas ( eg ) taken to be an inhomogeneous system of electrons with an _ electronic edge_. the edge is defined in terms of the classical turning points @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ks effective potential and @xmath4 is between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied ks eigenvalue .",
    "this describes a surface ( in the mathematical sense ) outside of which the orbitals decay at exponential rate .",
    "we take @xmath31 to be constant in two spatial directions whilst varying in the third .",
    "the resulting ks - orbitals are labeled with the quantum numbers @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 are plane wave numbers for the @xmath34- and @xmath35-dimensions and @xmath36 is the quantum number associated with the @xmath37-dimension .",
    "note that @xmath36 can either be a continuous or discrete quantum number , depending on the energy spectrum of the potential across the surface . in ref .",
    "the electron density of the eg for a general @xmath38 is found to be @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the corresponding eigenfunctions in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "furthermore , the ag is an edge gas with a linear potential @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the slope in the potential .",
    "this slope defines a characteristic length @xmath43{\\frac{1}{2f}}$ ] .",
    "apart from ref .",
    ", similar models have been investigated also in a number of previous works@xcite .",
    "the ks equation @xmath44 with @xmath45 has the solutions @xmath46{ll}}\\text{ai}\\left(\\frac{z}{l}+\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\eta}}{\\epsilon}\\right),\\ ] ] and eigenvalues @xmath47{\\frac{f^2}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the airy functions .",
    "the orbitals and eigenvalues scale directly with @xmath50 , which makes the ag effectively a zero parameter model .",

    "the result is a refinement function derived from the limit of slowly varying density far inside the surface from a linear potential , i.e. , it is a ge that includes quantum corrections from a surface .",

    "( [ eq : ag_corrections ] ) has the same coefficient as the etf ge given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : etf_grad ] ) , but differs in sign , whereas the term proportional to @xmath23 is completely different .",
    "the expression is a main result of this paper , and we will refer to it as the ag - ge .",
    "we are not aware of prior works that address the system dependence of ges with quantum corrections , so there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect this expression to be broadly applicable to a large set of systems with surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we will investigate the possible generality of this expression in regions of slowly varying electron density in other model systems .",
    "however , our first numerical investigation is the behavior of the etf ge and the ag - ge for the actual ag model system itself .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we compare numerically the exact ag ked , the ag - ge , and the etf ge far inside the inner region of the ag , and across the surface region .",
    "we see that the correction provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ag_corrections ] ) over etf is crucial to properly account for the oscillations in the ked far from the surface . in the edge region both of the expansions are expected to fail , since in this region the density is not slowly varying .",
    "however , it appears the quantum corrections included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ag_corrections ] ) worsen the result in this region compared to etf .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work we have considered the influence of quantum oscillations due to electronic edges in the ked in limit of slowly varying electron density .",
    "this has been achieved using the ag model system which is a useful approximation of an inhomogeneous system of many electrons with a well defined surface region@xcite .",
    "quantum oscillations in the ke and electron densities have previously been discussed @xcite and they are known to not be captured by the etf ge . on the other hand , the ag - ge in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ag_corrections ] ) is a gradient expansion that includes quantum gradient corrections from a linear surface .",
    "it is shown to describe the oscillations in the regime of slowly varying density in the jellium surface model and also in regions of slowly varying density in finite systems , i.e. , the isotropic ho and the hydrogen - like model .",
    "however , the ag - ge does not appear to represent the ked well in the limit of slowly varying density of the mg and hg model systems .",
    "in the low amplitude regime ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) of the mg , this is perfectly expected , since there is no classically forbidden region in the system , i.e. , the system has no surface . for this case",
    "the etf ge is within its domain of validity throughout the system without any quantum corrections .",
    "one may at a first think that the ked of the _ high amplitude _ mg , and indeed the hg , should be well represented by the ag - ge , since these systems have surface regions .",
    "what is seen however , is that none of the expansions reproduce well the ked in these systems .",
    "the failure of both the ges for the mg and hg systems may be the result of system dependence of the quantum corrections in spite of the apparent generality of the ag - ge for other systems with surfaces .",
    "however , our results lead us to speculate that the behavior may rather be a consequence of the very strong anisotropy between the dimensions in the mg and hg systems .",
    "the energy levels in the ag are infinitely dense in all three dimensions .",
    "the two finite systems considered ( the ho and the hydrogen - like potential ) are spherically symmetric and thus give a finite number of energy levels that are equally dense in all dimensions .",
    "however , the mg with large @xmath87 and the hg both have infinitely dense levels only in the @xmath34- and @xmath35-dimensions , whereas for the @xmath37-dimension there is a discrete spectrum ( ho ) or a band structure ( mg ) where the bands get thinner as the potential amplitude @xmath87 increases .",
    "our hypothesis thus means that the mg and hg systems may display a mix of both the ges .",
    "the etf describes the changes in the ked as the chemical potential moves _ between _ two discrete energy levels in the @xmath37-dimension , since such a change only adds plane - wave states in the @xmath34- and @xmath35-dimensions . on the other hand , as the chemical potential moves past the eigenvalues of states in the @xmath37-dimension , the change in the ked is supposedly described well by the ag - ge .",
    "this would explain why the true behavior of the ked in these systems appear to share features of both ges .",
    "however , if this interpretation is true , the ag - ge may be of very broad general validity in describing quantum oscillations in systems with surface regions , as long as the systems do not have unreasonably anisotropic dimensions .",
    "it is a long term goal of functional development to construct viable approximations of the exchange - correlation and kinetic energy in dft .",
    "prior work on quantum corrections , as well as the present one , suggest that the electron density and ked in a classically allowed region where the electron density is slowly varying depend on the influence of non - local information , in the sense that the quantum oscillations are determined by the behavior of @xmath89 outside the immediate neighborhood of the point @xmath90 .",
    "surfaces and/or classical turning points are examples of such signatures in the topological landscape of the single particle potential that influences the classically allowed region .",
    "the local energetics of the system in this region thus appears to differ between dissimilar systems and can not uniquely be described in terms of a straightforward extension of tf - theory , solely by adding more terms in the local expansion ( as is sometimes suggested , see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "one may at this point ask if a successful general semi - local approximation to @xmath14 valid for all limits of slowly varying electron density is even possible .",
    "is it possible for such a semi - local approximation to differentiate between a situation where the etf ge applies vs. when the ag - ge applies , based only on the semi - local information available in @xmath7 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ? to investigate this question we look at the path in countor plot of @xmath85 and @xmath23 as we take the limit of slowly varying density in a few different model systems .",
    "two such countor plots are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : svsq - hydrogen ] and [ fig : jellium - mg ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : svsq - hydrogen ] the behavior of the hydrogen - like model is shown to illustrate the complexity of how the limit of slowly varying density is achieved in these model systems . however , to address the question of the information available from @xmath22 and @xmath23 alone , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : jellium - mg ] both the jellium surface model and a low amplitude mg overlaid into the same figure .",
    "we know that the limit of slowly varying density of the jellium surface model is accurately described by the ag - ge , whereas the etf ge describes this particular low amplitude mg very well .",
    "as is seen in the figure , the two systems approach the limit of slowly varying density very differently .",
    "however , there are points where the curves intersect and the local value of the two expansions are not the same in these points .",
    "this suggests that there can not exist a simple semi - local approximation of @xmath91 that gets both types of limits right .",
    "this appear to be a problematic conclusion in the development of approximative expressions .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that the precise difference between the ag - ge and the etf ge this far into the limit of slowly varying electron density turns out to be energetically less relevant than other features of the ked .     vs. @xmath23 over all values of @xmath92 for a few hydrogen - like model systems filled up to and including the 3^rd^ shell .",
    "as the shell variable @xmath93 is increased , the number of loops increases and the curve approaches the origin , which demonstrates how the limit of slowly varying density is reached in this system within an intermediate region of @xmath92 values . ]     versus the scaled laplacian @xmath23 in the limit of slowly varying density for the case of a jellium surface ( @xmath94 ) as @xmath95 and a mathieu gas ( @xmath96 ) as @xmath97 . ]",
    "we have studied the ag in the limit far inside the surface where the electron density is slowly varying .",
    "the presence of a surface region in the system ( i.e. , where the density decays to zero ) requires quantum corrections compared to the usual etf ge .",
    "we have derived an expression for a ge incorporating such quantum corrections from the ag , the ag - ge , and find it to describe systems of both finite and infinite size with surface regions well . however , neither etf nor the ag - ge appear to apply directly to the two model systems considered where the energy level spacing is very anisotropic between different dimensions .",
    "furthermore , while the present work has exclusively discussed the kinetic energy @xmath14 , we note that the gradient coefficient in the ge for the exchange energy has been subject of some debate , with kleinman and lee @xcite arriving at the presently accepted value of @xmath98 for a partially integrated ge that avoids a laplacian term .",
    "the present work highlights the question if an alternative local exchange energy density ge may exist that takes into account the quantum corrections due to a surface region .",
    "however , the situation for a local ge of the exchange energy density is much less clear than for the ked .",
    "two of us have , in previous works , found that even for the mg in the limit of a weakly perturbed uniform electron gas , no such local ge appear to exist @xcite .",
