    "complex triple perovskites with the general formula a@xmath0b@xmath3b@xmath4o@xmath2 , where a is an alkaline earth metal , b@xmath3 and b@xmath5 are ions with valencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 , have recently attracted much interest as high - temperature proton conductors @xcite and as dielectric resonators @xcite .",
    "particularly , the nonstoichiometric series ba@xmath0ca@xmath8nb@xmath9o@xmath10 has been extensively investigated due to its high proton conductivity and chemical stability @xcite . in such oxides ,",
    "the formation of oxygen vacancies is achieved by increasing the @xmath11 ratio .",
    "the vacancies can be filled with oh@xmath12 species upon annealing samples in water vapour at high temperatures and even oh@xmath13 concentration is small , the ionic conductivity can be dominated by proton transport @xcite , enabling it for application in fuel cells .    despite oxygen vacancies can be highly mobile in simple abo@xmath0 perovskites,@xcite in complex perovskites as ba@xmath0canb@xmath1o@xmath2 the vacancy mobility tends to be strongly influenced by the @xmath11 ratio , valencies and ordering .",
    "substitutions in a and b sites of abx@xmath0 perovskites are responsible for improving a large part of the applications of these materials , bringing new physical and chemical properties.@xcite however , the substitution by more than one ion , mainly in b site , can lead to structures which are disordered or ordered , according the new ions distribution into the structure .",
    "this substitution leads to new crystalline structures when there is a ordered distribution .",
    "b - site cation - ordered triple perovskites whose chemical formula is a@xmath0b@xmath3b@xmath4o@xmath2 are a particular family obtained by b - site substitution .    from the structural viewpoint , in the triple b - site ordered substitution ( sometimes called 1:2 order ) , two main structures can be formed . in the first , an ordered b@xmath3/b@xmath5 substitution into b site can lead to a trigonal structure which belongs to the space group @xmath14 . in this structure the cations b@xmath3 and b@xmath5",
    "are alternately distributed in @xmath15 planes in the form @xmath16 .",
    "another possible structure for this composition is the so - called hexagonal @xmath17 structure that belongs to the @xmath18 space group , in which the b@xmath3o@xmath19 and b@xmath5o@xmath19 octahedra share edges.@xcite    however , partial disordered b@xmath3/b@xmath5 distribution in both structure can occur , with part of the b@xmath3 cations occupying the b@xmath5 cation sites and vice versa .",
    "partial disorder in perovskites plays an essential role because they strongly influence their physical properties . for example , order influences phonons and dielectric constant , implying in consequences for applications of 1:2 perovskites in wireless communication system.@xcite disorder is particularly interesting in ba@xmath0canb@xmath1o@xmath2 perovskites because it favors a higher conductivity in these protonic conductors based on nonstoichiometry ba compounds , which always have higher conductivity and lower activation energy than the corresponding sr compounds.@xcite due to the importance of ordering in ba@xmath0canb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bcn ) ceramics , mainly because its conductivity properties , in this work we proposed a systematically investigation of the order achievement in bcn complex perovskite .",
    "bcn samples were synthesized by polymeric precursor method using barium nitrate ( ba(no@xmath0)@xmath20 , sigma aldrich ) , calcium citrate tetrahydrate ( ca@xmath0(c@xmath19h@xmath21o@xmath22)@xmath234h@xmath20o , ecibra ) and ammonium complex of niobium ( nh@xmath24(nbo(c@xmath20o@xmath24)@xmath20(h@xmath20o)@xmath20 ) @xmath253h@xmath20o , cbmm ) as sources of metals @xcite .",
    "barium polymeric precursor was obtained by mixing aqueous solutions of barium nitrate and citric acid ( c@xmath19h@xmath26o@xmath27 h@xmath20o , proqumico ) in a molar ratio of 1:3 metal - citric acid , keeping stirring between 60 and 70 @xmath28c .",
    "finally , ethylene glycol ( hoch@xmath20ch@xmath20oh , merck ) was added to metal / citric aqueous solution in a mass ratio of 1:1 in relation to citric acid .",
    "calcium polymeric precursor was obtained following the same procedure for barium . to obtain niobium precursor we firstly precipitated niobium oxi - hydroxide stirring an aqueous solution of ammonium complex of niobium until ph of 9 in a thermal bath at 0 @xmath28c .",
    "niobium hydroxide ( nb(oh)@xmath21 ) was separated from oxalate ions using distilled water at 40 - 50 @xmath28c under vacuum filtering .",
    "finally , citric acid and ethylene glycol were added to the niobium hydroxide aqueous solution .",
    "the ph of the polymeric precursors was kept at the same values to avoid precipitations when mixing them . to determine the necessary precursor weight to achieve the correct metal stoichiometry to form bcn perovskite we used gravimetric analysis at 900 @xmath28c for 1 h. we mixed the three precursors and heated the mixture between 80 and 90 @xmath28c to form the polyester resin , which had high viscosity and glassy .",
    "the resin was annealed at 400 @xmath28c for 2h .",
    "this heat treatment converted the resin in a black porous powder .",
    "this powder was lightly grounded using an agate mortar .",
    "after it was calcined at 1300 @xmath28c for 2h to obtain bcn sample . this sample is our reference to investigate the ordering process and it will be referenced as _",
    "start sample _ along this work . from this reference sample",
    ", several pellets were sintered at different temperatures and time of sintering to investigate the ordering phenomena .",
    "the crystalline structure of the samples were probed by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd - bruker d8 advance ) .",
    "we performed a continuous scanning mode using cu - k@xmath29 radiation ( 40 kv , 40 ma ) over a @xmath30 range between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( 0.02@xmath33/step with 8 seconds / step ) .",
    "the powder xrd pattern was compared with data from icsd ( inorganic crystal structure database , fiz karlsruhe and nist ) international diffraction database ( icsd#162758 ) .",
    "@xcite the structure was refined using the dbws9807 free software .",
    "@xcite    the raman spectra of the samples were acquired at room temperature in an ihr550 horiba scientific spectrometer coupled to an olympus microscope model bx-41 .",
    "a he - ne laser ( 632.8 nm , 10 mw ) was use to excite the spectra that were collected in an air - cooled synapse ccd detector .",
    "the spectral resolution was kept lower than 2 @xmath34 using an 1800 grooves / mm grating in the spectrometer .",
    "all spectra were acquired in a backscattered configuration .",
    "the first - principle calculations were performed through the cambridge serial total energy package ( castep ) software package @xcite .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite was chosen to model the material considering generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as exchange - correlation functional .",
    "this approximation was improved by the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parameterization @xcite . the pbe functional leads to results close to those obtained using pw91 functional @xcite within ts method @xcite for the dispersion correction scheme ( dft+d ) to describe van der waals interactions .",
    "we also adopted pseudopotentials to replace the core electrons in each atomic species .",
    "specifically , norm - conserved pseudopotentials @xcite were used .",
    "these pseudopotentials were generated using the opium code @xcite , following the same scheme of previous works @xcite .",
    "the electronic valence configurations for each atomic species were : ba@xmath35 , ca@xmath36 , nb@xmath37 , and o@xmath38 . a monkhorst - pack @xcite @xmath39 sampling was used to evaluate all integrals in the reciprocal space .",
    "this sampling is enough to give a well converged electronic structure .",
    "we employed bfgs minimizer @xcite to optimize the unit cell . in this minimization algorithm ,",
    "a starting hessian is recursively updated . for each self - consistent field step ,",
    "the electronic minimization parameters were : total energy / atom convergence tolerance of @xmath40 ev , a maximum energy eigenvalues threshold of @xmath41 ev , and a convergence window of 3 cycles .",
    "a plane - wave basis set was adopted to represent the kohn - sham orbitals , with cutoff energy chosen of 880 ev .",
    "this value was obtained after convergence studies .",
    "the quality of this basis set was kept fixed as the unit cell volume varies during geometry optimization .",
    "the vibrational properties of bcn were calculated performing density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) calculations or linear response formalism @xcite .",
    "the linear response provides an analytical way of computing the second derivative of the total energy with respect to a given perturbation .",
    "depending on the nature of this perturbation , a number of properties can be calculated .",
    "a perturbation in ionic positions gives the dynamical matrix and phonons ; in the presence of magnetic field it gives the nmr response ; in unit cell vectors changes it gives the elastic constants ; in an electric field presence it gives the dielectric response , etc .",
    "the infrared absorption intensities are described in terms of a dynamical matrix and born effective charges ( also known as atomic polarizability tensors , atp ) @xcite and can be obtained by calculating the phonons at the @xmath42 point @xmath43 . the structure used for vibrational calculations was the fully ordered trigonal bcn structure optimized through the gga - pbe approximation .",
    "the geometry optimization criteria were more rigorous than the criteria used for lda - dft calculations , for example .",
    "the convergence thresholds used were : total energy convergence tolerance smaller than @xmath44 ev / atom , maximum ionic force smaller than @xmath45 ev /  , maximum ionic displacement tolerance of @xmath46  , and maximum stress component smaller than @xmath47 gpa . for the self - consistent field calculations ,",
