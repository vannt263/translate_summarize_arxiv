    "non - uniform filter banks are of interest in speech processing applications since they can be used to exploit the perceptual properties of the human ear  @xcite . a well known and efficient technique to realize a non - uniform filter - bank is the all - pass transformed polyphase filter - bank  @xcite-@xcite , where the delay elements of the input and output delay chains are replaced by first - order all - pass filters , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "such a warped filter bank has been found to be beneficial in applications such as speech enhancement and beamforming  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the warped filter banks also involve much lower delay and complexity in comparison to non - uniform filter banks realized by a tree structure  @xcite .",
    "since most hands - free and speech enhancement systems are coupled with an acoustic echo canceller  @xcite , it is important that the analysis and synthesis filter banks are optimized for echo cancellation .",
    "other realizations of non - uniform filter structures are obtained by joining two or more uniform filter bank structures of different bandwidths by transitions banks  @xcite-@xcite , or by combining a subset of varying numbers of subbands of a uniform filter bank  @xcite-@xcite . in  @xcite",
    "critically sampled non - uniform filter banks for adaptive filtering are realized by incorporating extra filters in between the non - uniform sub - bands to cancel the aliasing",
    ".    in echo cancellation for speech signals , cancellation of low - frequency echoes is most critical for two important reasons  @xcite .",
    "the first is because most of the speech energy is distributed in the low - frequency end of the audio spectrum .",
    "the second is due to room acoustics : in a typical room environment the higher - frequency components of an audio signal are more easily absorbed by the materials in the room ( walls , carpets , curtains , etc . ) and , as a result , the lower frequency sub - bands require much longer adaptive filter lengths to cancel the echoes . consequently , by using non - uniform filter banks that have bandwidths that increase with frequency , the convergence rate of the lower sub - bands can be improved significantly thereby resulting in more effective cancellation of the low - frequency echoes .",
    "the use of sub - band adaptive filters in acoustic echo cancellation has been quite popular , especially when the impulse response is very long , due to their fast convergence rate and low computational complexity in comparison to full - band adaptive filters  @xcite-@xcite . in sub - band echo cancellation ,",
    "one of the critical aspects of filter bank design is the minimization of the aliasing component during the analysis stage , as aliasing disturbs the convergence process of the adaptive filter .",
    "it is well known that aliasing in the sub - band signals caused by finite stop - band attenuation influences the mmse  @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "efforts to quantify the mmse via aliasing have been carried out in  @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    in  @xcite-@xcite non - uniform filter - banks",
    "were designed with emphasis on near - perfect reconstruction ( npr ) of the analysis - synthesis system .",
    "although these designs are useful in applications such as speech coding , they usually do not work well in adaptive filtering since the signal components in the adjacent bands that are required for npr are often severely modified by an adaptive filter . in  @xcite non - uniform filter - banks that minimize aliasing during the analysis stage",
    "were developed for beamforming and speech processing applications . with this approach ,",
    "a linear phase constraint is imposed on both the analysis and synthesis prototype filters , and the filter group - delay , which may not be optimal , must be specified .    in  @xcite",
    ", we framed the design method without phase constraints on the filters , which increases the degrees of freedom during optimization , and , in turn , improves the aliasing - suppression performance of the filters .",
    "then , in  @xcite we modified the objective function so that overall signal - to - alias ratio ( sar ) is maximized .",
    "the sar characterizes the factor by which the error signal power can be reduced by adaptive filtering and is equivalent to the widely used erle quality measure  @xcite .",
    "since each subband in a non - uniform filter bank has a different bandwidth , the contribution to sar from each subband will be different .",
    "consequently , to ensure that the overall sar is maximized the contribution from each of the analysis banks , as well as the psds of the input signal , @xmath0 , and the unknown system , @xmath1 , are taken into account during optimization in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we extend and improve on the method developed in  @xcite .",
    "we describe how the maximization of sar across the subbands leads to an increase in erle performance ; then , we formulate a convex optimization problem so that the sar is maximized across the subbands .",
    "experimental results show that the filter bank designed using the proposed method results in a much lower erle when compared to existing design methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the non - uniform filter - bank implementation while section iii describes the subband adaptive filter . in sections",
    "iv and v , the design of the analysis and synthesis prototype filters , respectively , are discussed . in section",
    "vi , experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "the non - uniform filter bank in fig .  1 is a generalization of the uniform dft filter bank where the delay element , @xmath2 , is replaced by a first - order allpass filter , @xmath3 , of the form @xmath4 using an @xmath5-point dft analysis bank , the transfer function , @xmath6 , and z - domain output signal , @xmath7 , of the @xmath8th analysis subband filter are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the analysis prototype filter , @xmath11 is the z - domain input signal , @xmath12 is the downsampling factor in the @xmath8th sub - band , and @xmath13 is the complex modulating factor . the corresponding synthesis bank is an @xmath5-point inverse - dft , with the @xmath8th synthesis subband filter given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the synthesis prototype filter .",
    "the overall input - output relationship for the analysis - synthesis system can be expressed as @xmath16 in general , the input - output transfer function of the analysis - synthesis system is a linear , periodically time varying system with period equal to the maximum downsampling factor @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , to account for this behaviour , the overall transfer function is computed by using a sequence of @xmath17 time - shifted impulses as input and given by @xmath18 where we have assumed @xmath19 for @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 , and @xmath23 as such , by replacing the delay element @xmath2 by the all - pass filter @xmath3 , the frequency response of the filter at frequency @xmath24 is mapped into frequency @xmath25 , given by  @xcite @xmath26\\ ] ] consequently , the @xmath8th subband filter @xmath6 will lie between frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be obtained by solving for @xmath30 using a simple line search optimization algorithm on the convex function @xmath31 where @xmath30 is the optimization variable . in section iii , frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be used as integration limits when computing the aliasing power in the subband filter @xmath6 .",
    "in fig .  2 the sub - band adaptive filter structure is shown .",
    "as can be seen , the input signal @xmath0 and desired signal @xmath32 are split into @xmath5 subbands by analysis filter banks . the resulting subband signals @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the @xmath8th subband are adapted independently of the other subband signals .",
    "the resulting errors @xmath35 from each of the subbands are then recombined to form the fullband error signal @xmath36 .    in most adaptive filtering applications ,",
    "the signal @xmath0 is represented as a stochastic signal with known power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath37 . to characterize @xmath0 by a spectrum rather than a psd",

    "if the length of each subband adaptive filter is made sufficiently long , the erle will then be dependent only on the power ratio between the desired signal and the steady state error due to aliasing , or sar  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a sub - band adaptive filter with sufficiently long sub - band adaptive filters so that the impulse response of the unknown system is adequately modelled , we have @xmath52 to compute the sar , we use the approximation in  @xcite and extend it to the non - uniform filter bank case , giving @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 the sar in each sub - band is given by @xmath56 equations ( [ sig1 ] ) and ( [ sig2 ] ) can be simplified if we exchange summation and squaring by ignoring the mixed product terms in the source model , which is justified if the unknown system is comprised of statistically independent frequency components  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 and @xmath58 become @xmath59 @xmath60 using ( [ model ] ) , @xmath61 above can be expanded as @xmath62 if @xmath63 and the average power spectrum of @xmath41 are not readily available , we can simplify further by setting @xmath64",

    "is given by @xmath114 method b essentially demonstrates the performance that can be attained when only the largest subband is considered , as was done in  @xcite , or when uniform filter bank design methods are employed .",

    "this is done so that the error - signal power obtained during the first 1 second can be normalized to 0 db in the erle plots .",

    "iii we observe that the sar values are about 10 db smaller than the corresponding erle values , but vary proportionally to the erle values .",
    "the difference between the erle and sar values arises because the sar in ( [ overallsar ] ) is computed right after analysis whereas the erle is estimated after analysis and synthesis . the additional aliasing signal suppression by the synthesis filters results in higher erle values that are proportional to the respective sar values .",

    "therefore , from ( [ dotproduct ] ) it is apparent that if @xmath10 is not zero , @xmath132 in ( [ aliasingsynsamedsimple ] ) remains unconstrained , and , consequently , the minimization of the the cost function in ( [ eq:21 ] ) under the constraint that @xmath133 , is independent of the analysis prototype filter .",
    "if , however , @xmath10 is zero for @xmath134 , then @xmath135 is also constrained to zero , and @xmath136 can have arbitrary values .",
    "because of this scenario , we introduce the regularization term @xmath108 in the optimization problem in ( [ eq:22 ] ) so that solution of @xmath15 with the minimum l2 norm is always selected ."
