    "due to the short lifetime of resonances ( few fm / c ) , interactions with the partonic and hadronic medium created in a heavy ion reaction , can modify their properties . depending on the medium conditions ; energy density , temperature and the degrees of freedom , various modifications to resonance properties , such as mass , width ( lifetime ) , yields and spectra ,",
    "are expected .",
    "the so - called bulk matter of low momentum resonances , i.e. resonances with a transverse momentum of p@xmath0 2  gev / c , are dominated by the extended dense hadronic medium due to an enhanced resonance regeneration probability .",
    "furthermore interactions of resonance decay hadrons with the hadronic medium are present , which leads to a reduction of the resonance yield .",
    "the reconstructed resonance yields , obtained through invariant mass reconstruction based on hadronic decays , are sensitive to the lifetime , density and temperature of the hadronic medium and to the decay lifetimes of the resonances and their regeneration cross sections .",
    "the measured ratio of the resonance to non - resonance yields @xcite at @xmath1 200 gev in au+au collisions can be described with a microscopic transport model ( urqmd ) which assumes a duration between chemical and kinetic freeze - out of @xmath2  fm / c @xcite . alternatively , suppression of the @xmath3(1520 ) and",
    "k(892 ) yields combined with a thermal model with an additional re - scattering phase @xcite , suggests a hadronic lifetime of @xmath4  fm / c @xcite .",
    "together with the pion hbt lifetime measurement ( @xmath5  fm / c )  @xcite , which determines the time from the beginning of the collision to kinetic freeze - out , a partonic lifetime can be extracted under the assumption that the chemical freeze - out occurs at hadronization @xcite .",
    "the further investigation of the lifetime and medium size dependencies of the hadronic phase on the hadronic resonances is presented in section  [ chaptersize ] and [ chapterenergy ] using smaller system size ( cu+cu collisions ) and a lower au+au collision energy ( @xmath1 62 gev ) .",
    "another observable which is sensitive to the degrees of freedom in the initial partonic phase , but which might also exhibit sensitivity to contributions from regenerated resonances in the hadronic phase , is the elliptic flow .",
    "the latter is the momentum anisotropy of emitted particles due to the spatial azimuthal asymmetry of the initial state under the assumption of maximum partonic interactions .",
    "the so - called constituent quark scaling of the elliptic flow for resonances will increase if a resonance is re - combined from hadrons rather than from quarks @xcite .",
    "results will be shown in section  [ chapterflow ] .    in order to study the partonic and early hadronic medium with resonances where chiral symmetry is possibly restored , the resonances need to be unaffected by the late hadronic medium where regeneration of resonances dilutes the signatures .",
    "even the reconstruction of leptonic decays might be affected by the signal from the hadronically regenerated resonances . since we know from urqmd calculations that the regeneration is predominant in the low momentum region ( p@xmath0 2  gev / c ) @xcite",
    ", the study of chiral symmetry restoration from leptonic decays might be only suitable in the high momentum region of p@xmath6 2  gev / c .",
    "the same argument is valid for the hadronic decays .",
    "high momentum resonances are produced early in the reaction and less affected by the re - scattering and regeneration in the hadronic phase because the system moves with a much smaller collective velocity and thus the high momentum particles can escape , in particular if the hard scattering which produced the resonance occurs near the surface .",
    "thus resonances from the same side jet in a triggered di - jet event should be less suppressed since they most likely traveled through less of the bulk medium . therefore to investigate medium modification of resonances in the medium resonances from the away side , which have the longer path length in the medium need to be selected .",
    "but their momenta should be large enough to be unaffected by re - scattering and regeneration in the subsequently produced hadronic medium .",
    "this idea requires the resonances to be formed earlier than the bulk hadrons , such that hadronic resonances can traverse the partonic medium .",
    "formation time arguments will be discussed in a later section .",
    "the analysis is based on selection of resonances from the away - side of a di - jet using a high p@xmath7 hadron trigger to select the jet axis .",
    "early feasibility studies will be shown in section  [ chapterjet ] .",
    "the lifetime of the hadronic phase depends on the system size and the expansion velocity .",
    "elementary p+p collisions exhibit a small system size and a nearly zero lifespan of the hadronic phase .",
    "we studied the ratios of resonances to stable particles with respect to centrality defined by the multiplicity of produced charged particles .",
    "we measured a suppression of @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite in central au+au compared to minimum bias p+p collisions . due to large errors",
    "the onset of the suppression from minimum bias p+p to peripheral au+au collisions could not be assigned to a narrow multiplicity range . with the new @xmath8 @xcite from cu+cu collisions we are able to better differentiate the low multiplicity region due to the smaller system size of the cu nuclei .",
    "[ cucu200 ] shows the ratio of @xmath8 versus the charged particle multiplicity for au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath10 200 gev .",
    "the agreement in the data shows that the suppression of resonances scales with charged particle multiplicity .",
    "furthermore the onset of the suppression seems to be occurring at a very low multiplicity and the maximum suppression is reached already at dn@xmath11/d@xmath12 = 100 and remains constant out to the most cental au+au collision ( dn@xmath11/d@xmath12 = 700 ) .",
    "this implies that the hadronic lifetime between the peripheral and central collisions remains constant .",

    "the masses and widths of the @xmath19(1020 ) signals for the different angular selections are in agreement with the pdg value . due to the low momentum of the associated @xmath19(1020 ) particle",
