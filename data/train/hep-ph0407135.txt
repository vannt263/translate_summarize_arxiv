    "since the origin of the quark model hadrons have been considered as bound states of constituent ( massive ) quarks .",
    "the constituent quark mass appears as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the original @xmath1 chiral symmetry at some momentum scale .",
    "this symmetry breaking also generates goldstone modes that are exchanged between the constituent quarks .",
    "explicit expressions and details of these potentials can be found elsewhere@xcite . in the heavy quark sector ,",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and therefore goldstone modes do not appear .    above the chiral symmetry breaking scale quarks",
    "still interact through gluon exchanges . following de rjula _",
    "et al._@xcite the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) interaction can be taken as a standard color fermi - breit potential . to obtain a unified description of light , strange and heavy mesons",
    "a running strong coupling constant has to be used@xcite .",
    "the perturbative expression for @xmath2 diverges when @xmath3 and therefore the coupling constant has to be frozen at low energies .",
    "this behavior is parametrized by means of an effective scale dependent strong coupling constant@xcite .",
    "the spin - spin interaction of the oge presents a contact term that has to be regularized in order to avoid an unbound spectrum from below . for a coulombic system",
    "the size scales with the reduced mass , what suggests to use a flavor - dependent regularization @xmath4@xcite .",
    "moreover the schrdinger equation can not be solved numerically for potentials containing @xmath5 terms .",
    "this is why the noncentral terms of the oge are also regularized .",
    "finally , potential models have to include other nonperturbative property of qcd , confinement .",
    "lattice qcd studies show that @xmath6 systems are well reproduced at short distances by a linear potential that it is screened at large distances due to pair creation@xcite .",
    "one important question is the covariance property of confinement .",
    "while the spin - orbit splittings in heavy quark systems suggest a scalar confining potential@xcite , szczepaniak and swanson @xcite showed that the dirac structure of confinement is of vector nature in the heavy quark limit of qcd .",
    "therefore , we write the confining interaction as an arbitrary combination of scalar and vector terms .    using this model",
    "we have studied more than 110 states from the light to the heavy sector@xcite , obtaining a rather good description .",
    "we have analyzed in detail several states reported in the charm sector which do not seem to fit into a @xmath0 structure .",
    "the same applies for the light scalar sector which does not seem possible to be described using only @xmath0 states .",
    "during the last year several new results of the @xmath7 mass have been reported .",
    "they are significantly larger than most predictions of constituent quark models and the previous experimental value of the pdg : @xmath8=3594 \\pm 5 $ ] mev@xcite .",
    "we find for this state an energy of 3627 mev , close to the new experimental value quoted by the pdg , @xmath9 mev .",
    "babar has reported a narrow state near 2317 mev called @xmath10@xcite . this state has been confirmed by cleo@xcite together with another possible resonance around 2460 mev .",
    "both experiments interpret these resonances as @xmath11 and @xmath12 states .",
    "the most striking aspect of these two resonances is that their masses are much lower than expected .",
    "our results are 2470 mev for the @xmath13 and 2550 for the @xmath14 .",
    "the other open - charm states agree reasonably well with the values of the pdg , but the two new @xmath15 states reported by belle and cleo do not fit into a @xmath16 scheme .",
    "the most recent state discovered in the charm sector is the @xmath17 , which was reported by belle@xcite with a mass of @xmath18 mev and confirmed by cdf@xcite .",
    "one of its most interesting features is that its energy is within the error bars of the @xmath19 threshold , @xmath20 mev . due to its experimental decays the most probable assignment for this state would be an @xmath21 @xmath22 state ,",
    "however most of the quark models predict a somewhat lower mass@xcite .",
    "our model gives 3790 mev for the @xmath23 , 3803 mev for the @xmath24 and 3793 mev for the @xmath25 , which are too low to be identified with it .",
    "another possibility is that this state could be an excited @xmath26 @xmath27wave@xcite , but again our prediction , 3913 mev , does not match the experimental energy .",
    "with respect to the isovector state , we find a candidate for the @xmath28 , the @xmath29 member of the lowest @xmath30 isovector multiplet , with and energy of 983 mev .",
    "however , in spite of the correct description of the mass of the @xmath28 , the model predicts a pure light - quark content , what seems to contradict some of the observed decays . in the case of the isoscalar states ,",
    "one finds a candidate for the @xmath31 with a mass of 413 mev , in the lower limit of the experimental error bar , but the @xmath32 can not be found for any combination of the parameters of the model . concerning the @xmath33",
    "sector our model predicts a mass for the lowest @xmath34 state 200 mev greater than the @xmath28 mass .",
    "therefore the @xmath35 can not be explained as a @xmath0 pair .",
    "it is worth to notice that similar conclusions has been achieved using approaches as different as chiral perturbation theory@xcite or an extended nambu - jona - lasinio model in an improved ladder approximation of the bethe - salpeter equation@xcite .",
    "this seems to indicate that other corrections would not improve the situation and the conclusions remain model independent .",
