    "this is what we have done so far .",
    "however , it is also interesting to  climb up \" and attempt a derivation , or at least a good motivation to include the born - infeld term in the gravitational action .",
    "we start this section recalling a well - known effect .",
    "consider a system of @xmath230 spins .",
    "if no external field is applied ( and the temperature is not too small ) the macroscopic average is @xmath231 . on the contrary , in the presence of an external field , @xmath232 ,",
    "the symmetry is broken , the spins align and produce a non - zero macroscopic average @xmath233 .",
    "it then follows that the total magnetic field felt by a charge @xmath234 is @xmath235 the orbit of the charge will obey the lorentz equation with @xmath236 not @xmath237 .",
    "if we did not know about spins the contribution @xmath238 would be interpreted as a sort of ` dark ' magnetic field .",
    "if the temperature is below the curie temperature , the external field could be removed and the spins remain in their ` ordered ' state with @xmath239 .",
    "let us now describe an analog of this effect in the theory of gravity .",
    "topological manifolds are invariant under the full diffeomorphism group .",
    "riemannian manifolds are invariant only under the subgroup of isometries of the metric .",
    "the state @xmath229 represents the unbroken state of general relativity @xcite , and the introduction of a metric breaks the symmetry .",
    "the natural geometrical analog of the external field @xmath237 is the metric tensor @xmath31 .",
    "( see @xcite for other discussions on the state @xmath229 , and @xcite for a recent critical viewpoint . )",
    "we shall treat the metric as an external field which can be switched on and off .",
    "our first goal is to explore fields that can be defined in the absence of a metric .",
    "the simplest example is given by a connection @xmath240 .",
    "in fact , eddington introduced a purely affine theory a long time ago @xcite , @xmath241 = \\kappa \\int d^4 x\\ , \\sqrt{k_{\\mu\\nu}(c)}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the curvature associated to the connection @xmath240 ( see eqn .",
    "( [ kmn ] ) ) .",
    "this action is invariant under spacetime diffeomorphism and yields second order differential equations for the field @xmath4 .",
    "eddington action was extensively studied as a purely affine theory of gravity , and also as a possible unification of gravity and electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "we take here a different interpretation and let the field @xmath4 be an independent degree of freedom .",
    "we now turn on the external field @xmath31 and study the effects of both @xmath31 and @xmath4 on particles .",
    "the first problem is to determine the action for the coupled system .",
    "we do not want to introduce ghost or higher derivatives .",
    "the action ( [ edd0 ] ) is already free of anomalies .",
    "so we start by adding the standard einstein - hilbert action for @xmath31 and consider @xmath242 with this action , the fundamental fields @xmath31 and @xmath4 are decoupled . to make the theory more interesting",
    "we add interactions .",
    "the most attractive theory ( although not unique ) having second order field equations is the einstein - born - infeld action introduced in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .    an important point now is to define the geodesic equation for the coupled system . in the presence of a metric @xmath31",
    "there is a natural affine connection @xmath243 represented by the christoffel symbol , @xmath244 the question is , should geodesics be defined with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath243 , both ? in order to comply with the equivalence principle we shall postulate that particles only couple to the metric and not to the connection @xmath21 .",
    "the geodesic equation then take the usual form @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the christoffel symbol ( [ chr ] ) .",
    "observe that the metric satisfies the equations ( [ ee ] ) and is coupled to the field @xmath21 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath21 does contribute to @xmath31 and indirectly affects the motion of particles .",
    "this is how the field @xmath87 can explain flat rotation curves .",
    "now , the analogy with spin systems can be pushed a little bit further .",
    "we have seen in the cosmological analysis that for large times the system approaches the de - sitter solution ( see sec .",
    "[ secdesitter ] ) , and in particular the metric @xmath32 becomes proportional to @xmath31 , @xmath247 .",
    "one can interpret this fact as analogous to the alignment of spins along the direction of the applied field , @xmath248 .",
    "of course , to support this interpretation one would need to consider generic initial conditions .",
    "this will be analyzed elsewhere .    finally , recall that when the external magnetic field is removed , spins can have a spontaneous non - zero average @xmath249 , and this vector generates forces on charged particles .",
    "is there a gravitational analogue to this effect ?",
    "the gravitational force is measured by the connection ( [ chr ] ) , entering in the geodesic equation .",
    "the external field is the metric .",
    "now , as the metric is removed , the christoffel connection becomes @xmath250 , with the same scaling weight in the numerator and denominator . for a large class of paths",
    "the limit is a finite function .",
    "since the only connection available at @xmath229 is @xmath4 , it is tempting to conjecture that @xmath251 , as the metric is removed . in this way",
    ", the geodesic equation has a non - trivial limit when the metric vanishes , and particles will feel ` forces ' . these are not forces in the usual sense because there is no metric .",
    "( although note that a geodesic equation , defined by parallel transport , can be introduced without a metric . )",
    "the limit @xmath252 was the key ingredient employed in @xcite for a different approach to understand dark matter as an effect associated to a topological manifold . to make these ideas precise a theory describing the process @xmath252 is necessary .",
    "we hope to come back to this interpretation in the future .",
    "dark matter and dark energy have unique properties and their understanding in one of the most crucial problems faced by theoretical physics today .",
    "dark matter does not interact with normal matter and this property has motivated us to look for fields which have this property somehow  built in \" .",
    "we have explored gravity coupled to connection @xmath253 field with a born - infeld action .",
    "this theory comply with the main background properties normally attributed to dark matter and dark energy .",
    "first , the evolution of the scale factor in cosmological models has the right time dependence interpolating between pressureless matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "at galactic scales dark energy is less relevant but dark matter still plays an important role . by an approximation valid for distances much smaller to the hubble radius",
    "we have solved the equations of motion for spherical objects and find the expected rotation curves .",
    "these curves satisfy the basic asymptotic flatness observed in galaxies providing new support for this proposal .",
    "we have left several topics for the future .",
    "the stability of this theory and the study of primordial fluctuations are important to determine the cmb anisotropies .",
    "this will be reported in @xcite . on galactic scales",
    "a systematic fit with observational curves is necessary .",
    "this issue is presently under study and will be reported in @xcite .",
    "the fields which are varied in the action ( [ i ] ) are the metric @xmath31 and the connection @xmath243 .",
    "the equations of motion for the metric follow by a straightforward variation of the action .",
    "the result is @xmath254 this equation can be drastically simplified by using the equation of motion for the connection @xmath243 .",
    "this equation is derived in two steps .",
    "first , since the action only depends on the curvature @xmath8 once can compute the variation using the chain rule , @xmath255 just like in eddington @xcite theory one finds by direct variation that the combination @xmath256 satisfies @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the covariant derivative built with the connection @xmath259 . since @xmath243 is symmetric , this equation imply @xmath260 we thus write @xmath243 in terms of @xmath32 .",
    "the equation ( [ k00 ] ) now depends only on @xmath32 . taking",
    "the determinant at both sides , and inverting one readily derives ( [ ke ] ) .",
    "the final simplification follows by noticing that the right hand side of ( [ 1 ] ) contains @xmath261 .",
    "thus , using ( [ k00 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is transformed into ( [ ee ] ) .",
    "the analysis of these equations is greatly simplified by using the bi - metric formalism @xcite .",
