    "entanglement is a fundamental quantity characterizing correlations in quantum field theories and quantum many - body systems .",
    "quantifying entanglement in ground states can be useful to detect and describe phase transitions , even when a conventional order parameter is unavailable @xcite , while excited state entanglement can shed light on spreading of correlations in out of equilibrium time evolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional system and examine entanglement entropies relative to a bipartition as a function of the subsystem size .",
    "when the subsystem size is much smaller than the correlation length , the model becomes effectively gapless .",
    "entanglement entropies in this case provide universal information about the underlying conformal field theory : in the ground state a logarithmic law proportional to the ( effective ) central charge is observed @xcite . in case of excited states ,",
    "the leading behavior for small subsystems is unchanged , but corrections appear , in scrutiny with the operator content of the theory , e.g. scaling dimensions of the most relevant operators can be identified @xcite .",
    "in fact , since conformal field theories are exactly solvable , entanglement entropies are calculable for any state in the conformal space and recent studies have been concentrating on this aspect to understand properties of excited states in critical systems @xcite .",
    "if the subsystem size is much larger than the correlation length , the area law governs entanglement in the ground state of local hamiltonians : entanglement entropy of a bipartition scales with the size of the boundary . in one spatial dimension this predicts a constant in the subsystem size @xcite .    in this paper we will be interested in the crossover between these two regimes .",
    "it was already shown that the crossover function is very interesting and encodes certain , generic information about the system , e.g. the first correction to the area law is determined only by the masses of stable particle excitations in the massive model @xcite .",
    "our aim here will be to develop and test a new approach capable to capture the whole scaling function describing the crossover from gapless to gapped behavior both for the ground state and excited states .",
    "we will work in relativistic quantum field theories , the scaling limit of many interesting 1d systems .",
    "our approach combines two established methods : first we will use the _ truncated conformal space _ to expand a state in the massive theory on the uv limiting conformal field theoretical space of states , and then we calculate the rnyi entanglement entropy exploiting conformal symmetry .",
    "our approach essentially extends the truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa ) to rnyi entropies .",
    "the tcsa @xcite is a hamiltonian truncation approach that enables to find states in the uv limiting cft hilbert space that correspond to ground states ( or on the same footing , excited states ) of massive deformations of the cft through the quantum mechanical variational principle .",
    "a finite matrix problem is obtained by going into finite volume and imposing an energy - wise truncation on the basis states .",
    "the truncation is justified by the expectation that for relevant perturbations and in finite volume the high energy sectors of the perturbed and unperturbed theories are the same and they do not couple to the low - energy sector . diagonalizing this finite hamiltonian matrix numerically , yields the spectrum of the system but also gives the corresponding eigenstates in terms of cft states .",
    "the tcsa has proven to be a powerful and versatile tool to evaluate not only the spectrum @xcite but various other quantities depending on the expansion of the states , e.g. form factors @xcite and boundary g - functions @xcite .",
    "we are encouraged by this success and indeed we will find that also in the case of rnyi entropy the tcsa is very robust .    via tcsa",
    "we reduce the problem of finding the rnyi entropy of an arbitrary qft state to finding it for an arbitrary cft state .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it enables to work in cft and exploit conformal symmetries in the calculations . for cft states",
    "rnyi entropies can be calculated efficiently by the replica approach . in this",
    "we use the fact that the @xmath0th rnyi entropy of an arbitrary state can be represented as a @xmath1-point functions on a riemann surface , which in cft can be mapped to @xmath1-point functions on the plane .",
    "these objects can be evaluated using standard methods @xcite .",
    "the replica method was initially described for the ground state of a cft @xcite and later it was generalized to states corresponding to primary fields @xcite and more recently also to arbitrary elements of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to use this latter generalization in conjunction with the tcsa .",
    "the advantage of our approach is at least two - fold .",
    "first , tcsa can treat a diverse array of models , including both integrable and nonintegrable ones , scaling limits of spin chains , through bosonization models relevant in strongly correlated electron physics @xcite or treating the interchain coupling as a perturbation can even be useful to understand two - dimensional systems @xcite . and second , finite volume effects are exponentially suppressed in field theory @xcite , making our approach a useful alternative to lattice methods when studying the thermodynamic limit .    to demonstrate these features we study two perturbations of the massless ising model , implemented by the energy density operator giving rise to the massive ising model , and by the magnetization operator corresponding to zamolodchikov s famous @xmath2 model @xcite .",
    "we will see that already in very small volumes the infinite volume behavior is recovered with great precision and the results quickly become volume independent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "previous theoretical results are recalled about rnyi entropies in quantum field theories . in section 3",
    "we outline the idea of the tcsa and its application to calculate rnyi entropies . in section 4",
    "we present results on deformation of the massless @xmath3 ising field theory , reproduce the second rnyi entropies of various low - lying states in the massive ising field theory and its lattice realization , the tfim , and study the effects of the longitudinal field .",
    "section 5 is reserved for conclusions .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on the second rnyi entropy , a particular measure of entanglement relative to a spatial bipartition of the system , @xmath4 . it and can be defined as @xmath5 with @xmath6 full and @xmath7 partial density matrices .",
    "@xmath8 is a particular state of the full system .",
    "@xmath9 is also equivalent to the purity of the subsystem @xmath10 .    in a field",
    "theoretical setting it is useful to reinterpret the quantity @xmath11 in terms of a euclidean path integral @xcite .",
    "we find that the field in the path integral lives on a riemann surface @xmath12 with nonzero curvature , in case of the ground state , @xmath13_\\mathcal{r}\\exp\\left[-\\int_\\mathcal{r}d\\tau dx \\,\\mathcal{l}[\\varphi](\\tau , x)\\right]\\ ] ] where the proportionality reflects a further normalizing constant setting @xmath14 .",
    "the riemann surface @xmath12 is composed of two sheets sewn together along the subsystem @xmath15 at euclidean time @xmath16 according to @xmath17    we can obtain a local theory by rewriting this path integral in terms of two copies of the original field both living on the euclidean plane @xmath18 , however at a price of inserting two local operators into the integral , @xmath19_{\\mathbb{r}^2}\\mathcal{t}(0,0)\\tilde{\\mathcal{t}}(0,a)\\times\\\\ \\times\\exp\\left[-\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^2}d\\tau dx \\,(\\mathcal{l}[\\varphi_1]+\\mathcal{l}[\\varphi_2])(\\tau , x)\\right]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and the local operators , dubbed as branch - point twist fields ( for the second rnyi entropy @xmath20 ) , implement the following conditions @xmath21 in this way , we obtained the exponentiated rnyi entropy as a two - point function of the twist fields , @xmath22+\\mathcal{l}[\\varphi_2],\\mathbb{r}^2}\\ ] ]    the formalism generalizes to excited states by replacing in the previous equation the vacua by the excited states , @xmath23+\\mathcal{l}[\\varphi_2],\\mathbb{r}^2}\\ ] ]      to calculate the two point function of twist fields in massive quantum field theories a form factor approach was developed , initially in the presence of integrability @xcite .    the most important result of this program was to determine the entanglement entropy s ( @xmath24 ) approach of the area law when the correlation length and the subsystems size is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the formula is quite generic and applies irrespective of integrability @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the correlation length , @xmath27 a nonuniversal constant , @xmath28 is the modified bessel function . in the slowest decaying term ( in terms of the subsystem length @xmath29 ) ,",
    "interestingly , the spectrum of stable particle excitations @xmath30 enter @xcite .",
    "the nonuniversal constant is such that for @xmath31 one would recover the cft result .    for the rnyi",
    "entropy the leading behavior is the same , but with different constants , @xmath32 where @xmath33 comes from the vacuum expectation value of the twist field",
    ". a less suppressed decay of @xmath34 is also believed to be possible for the rnyi entropies , when one - particle form factors of the twist field are non - vanishing @xcite , however such decay was not yet observed .",
    "when the theory is integrable in principle the form factors can be determined exactly by solving the form factor bootstrap and further corrections to ( [ sa ] ) and ( [ s2a ] ) could be given , see e.g. @xcite , however such spectral series can converge extremely rapidly and the higher particle contributions can be almost zero . in the case of free fermions",
    "the two - particle form factors give the following , @xmath35 with @xcite @xmath36 and @xmath37 we compared this approximation to the exact result @xcite available trough solving an ode and found that indeed eq .",
    "( [ isingexact ] ) reproduces the exact result very precisely for @xmath38 .",
    "in massless relativistic qfts we can directly calculate the path integral ( [ piriemann ] ) exploiting conformal invariance and using a consistent regularization scheme .",
    "in fact , we can go further and treat excited states on the same footing thanks to the state - operator correspondence , i.e. implementing the excited state by inserting local operators in the far ( euclidean ) past and future .",
    "following @xcite we use a series of conformal maps to obtain the excited state exponentialized rnyi entropy in terms of four point functions on the complex plane .",
    "first the finite volume physical manifold of a cylinder ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) is mapped to the complex plane , @xmath41 so that the insertion points of the operators implementing the excited states will be in 0 and @xmath42 .",
    "we identify @xmath11 with @xmath43 where the indices refer to coordinates on the two different riemann sheets . in cft",
    "the normalization can readily be determined as the ratio @xmath44 of partition functions of the @xmath0-sheeted and 1-sheeted riemann surfaces irrespective of the particular state . in finite volume",
    "this leads to @xcite @xmath45^{-c/4}\\ ] ] with a uv regularization parameter @xmath46 and we introduced @xmath47 the relative subsystem size .    now using the unifying map @xmath48 prescribed to take the first sheet to the principal branch and the second to the other branch of the square root , we express the four point function ( [ fourr ] ) by a four point function on the plane , @xmath49 we have to track the transformation of the inserted operators under this mapping .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath50 for the transformed operators .",
    "the generic transformation rule of descendant operators was worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite and we recall it in appendix a. using the composition rule of conformal transformation we can eliminate the adjoints from ( [ fourad ] ) and finally observing the equality @xmath51 we arrive at @xcite @xmath52 where we supposed that the adjoint field is the same as the original one .    this four point function can now be evaluated by a systematic approach that generates all descendant four point function by exploiting the conformal ward identities and determining the differential operator producing it from four point functions of primary fields . for chiral fields",
    "this leads to @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the generalization for fields with both chirality is straightforward .",
    "we will take advantage of the success of the general framework for rnyi entropies of excited states in conformal field theories and we will approximate the states of the massive theory with a linear combination of excited states in the underlying cft through the tcsa .    to outline the approach let us again consider periodic boundary conditions . on the corresponding euclidean space - time cylinder of circumference @xmath55",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the hamiltonian of the uv limiting cft .",
    "we will diagonalize this hamiltonian on the conformal hilbert space @xmath58 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the representation of the virasoro algebra with highest weight @xmath61 . supposing a discrete set of primary operators we get a finite matrix problem when a truncation is imposed on the conformal space by throwing away less important states , e.g. with energy greater than some @xmath62 .",
    "we can write the tcsa hamiltonian as @xcite @xmath63\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in order to diagonalize this matrix",
    "we need the three - point functions , @xmath66 , which are exactly calculable in a systematic way using the conformal ward identities ( see e.g. @xcite where this calculation is detailed with a superconformal extension ) .",
    "the diagonalization yields the following @xmath67    application to rnyi entropies is facilitated by the state - operator identification @xmath68 we simply insert this operator into ( [ four ] ) and perform the sum @xmath69 it is clear that the transformation of all the operators in the operator space and the four point functions of all combinations of them will be required to find the rnyi entropy .",
    "the transformation rules can be worked out in a straightforward way ( see e.g. appendix [ appa ] ) but obtaining the four - point functions of all ( inequivalent ) combinations of local fields seems at first extremely challenging .",
    "our experience indeed suggested that an exact approach to the four point functions is necessary to explore the entire @xmath70 domain , and achieving any progress is possible only when a systematic computer algebraic implementation of these calculations is used .",
    "we will study deformations of the @xmath3 ising cft . first let us recall the hilbert space structure .",
    "it consists of the following verma modules , @xmath71 and the hilbert space is @xmath72 the corresponding spin zero fields are the identity @xmath73 , the magnetization @xmath74 and the energy density @xmath46 operators .",
    "to calculate the rnyi entropies after determining numerically the representations of massive states on the cft basis , we also need all the @xmath0-point functions up to @xmath75 between all possible operators .",
    "the primary operators have the following @xmath0-point functions .",
    "one point functions are vanishing except for that of the identity , @xmath76 two point functions are fixed by normalization , @xmath77 three - point functions are fixed by global conformal maps and the structure constants , @xmath78 where the only nonzero nontrivial structure constants are @xmath79 ( with arbitrary permutations of the three operators ) .",
    "the four point functions are the following @xmath80 with the conformal blocks @xmath81 @xmath0-point functions of descendant can be calculated from the primary @xmath0-point functions using conformal ward identities .",
    "this calculation is based on the same principles as that of the descendant three - point functions already needed for the tcsa hamiltonian .",
    "however in case of four - point functions the complexity increases far quicker and we need to retain the functional dependence on the anharmonic ratio throughout the algebraic manipulations .",

    "we made numerical tcsa calculations to obtain the ground state of the massive deformation of the ising model .",
    "we used a mere 30 state basis corresponding to an energy cutoff @xmath86 .",
    "calculations are further simplified , since the hamiltonian is block diagonal on the subspaces defined by descendants of @xmath87 and those of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( in the lattice picture this is because fermion number is conserved irrespective of @xmath90 ) .",

    "we expect better convergence rates a priori .",
    "however , the downside is that while in the absence of a longitudinal field the states could be built using only the tower of @xmath74 or equivalently , the towers @xmath73 and @xmath46 , here all cft states contribute to the expansions and we need _ all _ four point functions to assemble the rnyi entropies . because of this complication and numerical instabilities we could only achieve a cutoff of @xmath104 , or equivalently 18 states .",

    ". we could numerically determine the saturation value and determined from its approach that , interestingly , the twist fields in this model have vanishing one - particle form factors .",
    "while we could obtain reliable and relatively precise results , we were forced to use extremely low cutoffs when truncating the conformal space .",

    "<S> a new numerical approach to entanglement entropies of the rnyi type is proposed for one - dimensional quantum field theories . </S>",
    "<S> the method extends the truncated conformal spectrum approach and we will demonstrate that it is especially suited to study the crossover from massless to massive behavior when the subsystem size is comparable to the correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> we apply it to different deformations of massless free fermions , corresponding to the scaling limit of the ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields . for massive free fermions the exactly known crossover function </S>",
    "<S> is reproduced already in very small system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the new method treats ground states and excited states on the same footing , and the applicability for excited states is illustrated by reproducing rnyi entropies of low - lying states in the transverse field ising model . </S>"
