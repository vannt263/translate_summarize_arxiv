    "high - frequency acoustic waves are increasingly used to actuate and manipulate fluids at microscales , with applications that include flow generation , @xcite particle collection or separation,@xcite acoustic levitation , @xcite and calibration of high - frequency transducers @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the field of acoustic microfluidics is in rapid development ( see refs .   for recent reviews ) .",
    "many applications and experiments involve the motion of small , typically spherical particles , either as objects to be manipulated , or simply as tracers used to visualise the flow .",
    "there is therefore considerable interest in modelling the dynamics of such particles , especially the mean dynamics that results from averaging over many wave periods .",
    "this is a classical problem that has motivated a great deal of work which we review briefly below .",
    "( see also the review in ref ) most of this work focuses on the calculation of the acoustic ( radiation ) pressure acting on particles as a result of wave scattering .",
    "this is not the only physical effect affecting the motion of particles .",
    "acoustic streaming@xcite  the nonlinear generation of a mean flow by acoustic waves  acts even in the absence of particles and is the main mechanism exploited in acoustic microfluidics ; it clearly affects the dynamics of particles , though in a way that is sometimes difficult to distinguish from acoustic radiation .",
    "@xcite the inertia of the particles and of the fluid , and the viscous ( stokes ) drag caused by the motion relative to the surrounding fluid are the other two main physical effects .    the relative role of these four effects ",
    "acoustic pressure , streaming , inertia and viscous drag  is the main theme of this paper .",
    "specifically , we explore how , depending on the parameters of the problems , the mean dynamics of a single spherical rigid particle can be controlled by different balances among these effects , and we derive the corresponding mean equations of motion .",
    "we do so by applying a systematic multiscale approach : taking the standard linear acoustics hypothesis of small - amplitude waves , characterised by an acoustic mach number @xmath0 , we consider possible distinguished scalings of the other parameters in the problem , primarily viscosity measured by the ratio @xmath1 of the stokes boundary - layer thickness to the sphere radius .",
    "we apply multiscale and matched - asymptotics methods to obtain asymptotic equations governing the motion over long time scales .",
    "crucially , this requires ( i ) to consider the fully coupled fluid - particle system , recognising that a reduction to an ordinary differential equation for the particle alone is possible only in certain parameter regimes ; and ( ii ) to take into account explicitly the mean displacements of the particle .",
    "this is in contrast with much of previous work which , as mentioned , concentrates on acoustic pressure and typically assumes that the mean particle position can be taken as frozen .    in the classic work by @xcite and",
    "@xcite on acoustically - driven particles in inviscid fluids ( with assumptions of , respectively , axisymmetry and long wavelength @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the wavelength ) , explicit expressions are derived for the acoustic pressure in this way ; the effect of the fluid motion is subsequently taken into account in a somewhat ad hoc manner by including an added mass effect in newton s second law for the particle .",
    "our treatment shows this to be valid for sufficiently small viscosity and makes precise how small the viscosity needs to be .",
    "the case of a viscous fluid has been considered in many papers,@xcite culminating in the work of doinikov @xcite who provides complete expressions for the acoustic pressure in an axisymmetric field for arbitrary viscosity and wavelength .",
    "simplified expressions valid for @xmath2 and arbitrary wave fields have recently been obtained by @xcite ( see also ref .   and references therein ) . in this viscous case ,",
    "a closed equation of motion for the sphere can be inferred from the acoustic force by assuming that the inertia of the particle and surrounding fluid is negligible .",
    "again , our treatment shows this to be a valid approximation under conditions that we make explicit .",
    "more importantly , our analysis reveals a new regime ( termed regime ii below ) in which the fluid motion driven by the particle is both crucial for the particle dynamics and determined by the full ( viscous ) navier  stokes equations instead of the simple potential solution relevant in the purely inviscid approximation . in this regime , the particle and fluid motion are completely coupled , and no reduction to a single ordinary differential equation is possible .",
    "much of the earlier work on acoustic pressure was motivated by applications very different from those arising today from developments in acoustic microfluidics .",
    "the focus of this paper reflects these developments : in particular , we pay attention to the case of particles with the same density as the fluid . while this case is ` of no interest for practice ' @xcite when dealing with , say , dust particles or water drops in air , it is highly relevant in microfluidics applications where the particle density is often selected to avoid buoyancy effects .",
    "we examine the conditions that need to be satisfied for such particles to follow fluid elements and hence act as genuinely passive tracers .",
    "this is important in view of the widespread use of particles for this purpose in acoustic microfluidics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ strategy ] introduces the governing equations and relevant non - dimensional parameters .",
    "based on this , and under the assumption @xmath4 ( which includes @xmath2 ) , it gives a heuristic argument for the existence of two distinguished asymptotic regimes in which three of the four physical effects affecting particle motion balance .",
    "these two regimes are considered in detail in sections [ regi ] and [ regii ] . there",
    "we apply systematically multiscale asymptotics to derive the equations governing the mean dynamics in each regime .",
    "these equations can be further simplified in several intermediate regimes in which only two of the four physical effects come into play .",
    "these regimes are of great practical importance ; the relevant equations are derived in section [ intreg ] .",
    "the paper concludes in section [ dis ] with a brief summary , a discussion of the relevance of the results to examples of acoustic microfluidics experiments , and pointers to further work , including on the case @xmath5 . throughout ,",
    "we emphasise the systematic derivation of mean equations of motion over specific expressions for the acoustic - pressure terms .",
    "we refer the reader to earlier work for these and point out the approximations that can be made consistently in each of the regimes we analyse .",
    "we note that complete expressions for the acoustic pressure have been obtained for axisymmetric wave fields ( ref .",
    "and references therein ) and for general wave fields provided that @xmath2 ( refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "our results have the same range of validity .",
    "we study the mean dynamics of a rigid sphere in an axisymmetric acoustic wave field .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the effect of heat conduction @xcite",
    ". the problem is then characterised by 8 parameters : the fluid properties determine the equilibrium density @xmath6 , sound speed @xmath7 and shear and bulk viscosities @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; the particle is characterised by its density @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 ; the incident wave by a frequency @xmath12 and a velocity amplitude @xmath13 . see figure [ system ] for an illustration .",
    "the @xmath14-theorem of dimensional analysis yields 5 dimensionless parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath1 , where @xmath18 is the stokes boundary - layer thickness ( e.g. , ref .  ,",
    "section 5.13 ) , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is wavenumber .",
    "since we are dealing with acoustic waves , we naturally assume that the acoustic mach number @xmath21 is small : @xmath22 .",
    "different dynamical regimes then emerge depending on the size of the other dimensionless parameters relative to @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that both @xmath15 and @xmath23 are @xmath24 as is relevant to most applications .",
    "this leaves the two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath19 which we relate to @xmath21 according to @xmath25 the exponents @xmath26 and @xmath27 introduced in ( [ alphagamma ] ) control the nature of the dynamics .",
    "their physical interpretation is clear : increasing @xmath26 decreases the strength of the viscous effects , while increasing @xmath27 increases the wavelength .",
    "the problem at hand involves two distinct time scales : the wave time scale @xmath28 and a slower time scale characterising the mean motion of the sphere . to capture this",
    ", we introduce a slow time variable @xmath29 , related to the fast ( wave ) time @xmath30 by @xmath31 to apply systematic asymptotic methods , the exponent @xmath32 should be related to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this requires to consider to the balance of terms in the equations governing the dynamics of the coupled fluid - particle system .",
    "the fluid is governed by the compressible navier ",
    "stokes equations    [ navier ] @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the fluid density , @xmath35 its velocity , @xmath36 is the stress tensor , and @xmath37 is the pressure .",
    "subscripts denote components and einstein s summation convention is used .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the position vector , @xmath40 the position of the centre of the particle , and @xmath41 denotes the sphere of radius @xmath11 centred at @xmath40 , and by a prescribed incident acoustic field at infinity @xmath42 the motion of the particle is governed by newton s second law written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass of the particle and @xmath45 denotes the outer normal .",
    "since the sphere is symmetric and placed in an axisymmetric wave field , its motion is one dimensional along the axis of symmetry of the wave field ; we choose this direction to be the @xmath46 axis , with unit vector @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 .",
    "note that the assumption of an axisymmetric wave can be relaxed when @xmath2 since an arbitrary wave field is can then be regarded as locally planar . in view of the practical importance of this approximation , satisfied in the majority of applications ,",
    "we write our results , whenever possible , in a vector form that can be employed for general wave fields when @xmath2 .",
    "our focus is on the mean motion of the particle , driven by the force on the right - hand side of ( [ newton ] ) averaged over a wave period .",
    "we denote this average by @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 . considering an expansion of all the variables in the form",
    "[ expand ] @xmath51    where @xmath52 captures the mean motion of the particle , we write the averaged force as @xmath53 note that the integrations are over the surface of the sphere centred at @xmath52 which moves only over the slow time scale . the second term on the right - hand side ,",
    "however , arises from the integration of @xmath54 over the rapidly moving surface @xmath55 ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a derivation ) .",
    "the force in ( [ totforce ] ) contains two distinct physical effects .",
    "the first is viscous drag which relaxes the particle s velocity to the velocity of the surrounding fluid .",
    "it is not obvious what the relevant fluid velocity is but it certainly includes the streaming velocity that is generated by dissipation and nonlinearity even in the absence of a particle @xcite .",
    "the second effect is the radiation pressure associated with the scattered wave . with this in mind",
    ", we can postulate a heuristic form for the equation governing the mean motion of the particle , estimate the order of magnitudes of its terms , and find the combinations of @xmath26 , @xmath32 and @xmath27 that lead to distinguished limits as @xmath56 .",
    "these limits are crucial since the corresponding regimes include all the physical mechanisms that can possibly have a leading - order effect simultaneously .",
    "our aim is to derive mean equations that apply to these regimes ; simpler models , valid in intermediate regimes , can then be deduced straightforwardly by neglecting certain terms .",
    "heuristically , we can expect the mean motion of the particle to be governed by an equation of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a mass , expected to be the mass of the particle plus a possible added mass stemming from fluid motion , @xmath59 is a streaming velocity , and @xmath60 is the acoustic - pressure force . here and henceforth , the overdot denotes time derivative with respect to the slow time @xmath29 .",
    "below each term in ( [ guessdyeq ] ) we indicate its relative order of magnitude , based on the dimensional estimates @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these assume : typical particle displacements @xmath52 of size @xmath65 ; a streaming velocity @xmath66 , which holds provided that the amplitude of the waves varies on an ` outer scale ' that is not too dissimilar to @xmath67 ( e.g. , refs .  ) ; and the scaling @xmath68 for the surface integrals in ( [ totforce ] ) .",
    "the latter scaling follows from applying the divergence theorem and the assumption that @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath69 so that the spatial derivatives scale like @xmath3 rather than @xmath70 ; it is confirmed by explicit computations of the acoustic radiation force , e.g. in ref .  .",
    "for now , we focus on the case @xmath69 and leave a brief analysis of the case @xmath71 for section [ sphfol ] .",
    "distinguished limits are obtained by selecting @xmath26 and @xmath32 to balance as many of the 4 terms in ( [ guessdyeq ] ) as possible .",
    "it is easy to see that 3 terms at most can be involved in any dominant balance .",
    "this yields four possibilities :    1 .",
    "the particle s inertia is negligible , leading to the condition @xmath72 , that is , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for the balance of the remaining terms .",
    "we refer to the corresponding regime as regime i. 2 .",
    "the streaming velocity @xmath59 is negligible , leading to @xmath75 , that is , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we refer to this as regime ii .",
    "the particle s viscous drag is negligible . balancing the remaining terms",
    "leads to @xmath73 and @xmath77 but also to an @xmath78 viscous drag , thus much larger than the other terms , inconsistent with our assumption .",
    "there is , therefore , no distinguished limit in which the viscous drag is negligible .",
    "acoustic pressure is negligible .",
    "this leads to @xmath79 and @xmath74 and again to an inconsistency : there is no distinguished limit with negligible acoustic pressure .",
    "we derive the average equations holding in regimes i and ii in sections [ regi ] and [ regii ] .",
    "intermediate regimes , in which only two of the terms in ( [ guessdyeq ] ) enter the dominant balance , are examined in section [ intreg ] .",
    "we emphasise that these intermediate regimes , though they may formally correspond to values of @xmath26 and @xmath32 different from those in regimes i and ii , can be deduced as limiting cases .",
    "for instance , a balance between the particle s inertia and the acoustic pressure , obtained for @xmath77 and any value @xmath80 , is deduced from regime ii by neglecting viscous drag .",
    "we first consider the distinguished limit in which the particle s inertia is negligible , corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74 . because viscosity is an @xmath24 effect in this case , the averaged force ( [ totforce ] ) is given by the complete expression computed by @xcite .",
    "although he assumed that the particle does not have a slow motion , including this motion requires only a straightforward modification of his calculation because of the large time - scale separation implied by @xmath74 ; the present section is therefore largely a brief review of ref .",
    "to which the reader is referred for details .",
    "all dynamical variables are expanded in powers of @xmath21 according to ( [ expand ] ) and regarded as functions of both times @xmath30 and @xmath29 , except for the constant @xmath6 and the @xmath30-independent @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that @xmath52 captures the entirety of the slow motion so that @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "introducing the expansion into the governing equations ( [ navier])([newton ] ) yields a linear viscous wave equations for @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 coupled with the equations @xmath86 governing the particle motion and its interaction with the fluid .",

    "the amplitudes @xmath95 are determined by the prescription of the incident wave as @xmath96 .",
    "the scattered part of the wave field is determined by a potential @xmath97 and streamfunction @xmath98 such that @xmath99 , with @xmath100 the azimuthal unit vector of the spherical coordinate system ; these are given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the spherical hankel function and @xmath103 the associated legendre polynomial .",
    "@xcite gives explicit expressions for the constants @xmath104 and @xmath105 .      continuing the expansion of ( [ navier ] ) to @xmath106 leads to the equations    [ 001 ] @xmath107    which become    [ 017 ] @xmath108    upon averaging .",
    "averaging the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) gives @xmath109 the left - hand side of ( [ mbci ] ) can be recognised as a lagrangian mean velocity summing eulerian mean velocity and stokes drift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : indeed , in view of ( [ coupling ] ) , @xmath110 is both the particle and fluid displacement .",
    "the final equation for the mean flow is provided by the average of ( [ newton ] ) to order @xmath106 . with @xmath74 ,",
    "the slow acceleration of the particle is @xmath111 and does not appear at this order , leaving the dominant balance @xmath112 the linear problem ( [ 017])([mbci ] ) for @xmath113 and @xmath114 was solved explicitly by @xcite with a vanishing right - hand side for ( [ mbci ] ) ; the difference is minor and the effect of the extra term is easy to track down .",
    "introducing the result into ( [ ds_i ] ) leads to the final equation for the particle motion @xmath115 which has the form expected in our discussion of distinguished regimes in section [ strategy ] ( cf .",
    "( [ guessdyeq ] ) ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath116 in ( [ meandyi ] ) is given by @xmath117 and can be interpreted as a form of lagrangian velocity averaged over the surface of the particle .",
    "here , we have used axisymmetry to express the stokes drift in terms of the @xmath118-component of the particle displacement @xmath119 . note",
    "that while the second term in ( [ tildev ] ) is the stokes drift of fluid particles lying on the sphere , the first only includes the eulerian - mean velocity associated with the incident part of the wave ; as a result , @xmath116 differs from the full lagrangian velocity of these fluid particles .",
    "the acoustic pressure in ( [ meandyi ] ) is given by @xmath120 it depends on the wave amplitudes @xmath95 and on the coefficients @xmath121 , which are slight modifications of the @xmath122 computed by @xcite ( his eq .",
    "( 5.6 ) ) .",
    "specifically , our @xmath121 are deduced from the @xmath122 by setting the coefficients @xmath123 to zero and omitting the terms proportional to the functions @xmath124 from the coefficients @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "this modification is made to include the stokes - drift term in the velocity @xmath116 whereas @xcite includes it in his acoustic force ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "we find our choice convenient for two reasons : ( i ) all the terms in @xmath127 depend on the scattered wave in the sense that @xmath128 as @xmath129 ; and ( ii ) @xmath130 and @xmath127 have different behaviours in the limits of large and small viscosity .",
    "we discuss ( ii ) further in section [ larvisreg ] .    to summarise , the dynamics of the sphere in regime i is controlled by a balance between a stokes drag towards the streaming velocity @xmath116 and the acoustic pressure .",
    "we next illustrate the transient dynamics this leads to with the familiar example of a plane standing wave .      for a plane standing wave , the potential of the incident wave can be expressed as @xmath131 where @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "note that the dependence of the @xmath95 on @xmath133 couples the wave field on the particle to the mean position @xmath133 of the particle . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the particle motion in the particular case @xmath134 and in the long wavelength limit @xmath135 . in this limit",
    ", it can be shown using the asymptotics of bessel functions @xcite that the coefficients @xmath121 in ( [ forcei ] ) satisfy @xmath136 . as a result",
    ", the acoustic pressure reduces to @xmath137 similarly , @xmath116 reduces to the lagrangian - mean velocity of the incident wave ( see section [ sphfol ] ) , which vanishes for standing waves .",
    "the position of the sphere therefore obeys the equation @xmath138 with solution @xmath139 and @xmath140 is determined by the initial condition .",
    "this shows that the sphere converges exponentially towards the nodes of the standing waves over a time scale @xmath141 .",
    "regime ii is characterised by @xmath76 , corresponding to a weaker dissipation than in regime i , with @xmath142 rather than @xmath24 . as a result ,",
    "the acoustic pressure on the particle is balanced by a combination of viscous drag and inertia , while the streaming velocity @xmath116 is negligible .",
    "the mean time scale is short compared to that in regime i , @xmath143 rather @xmath144 ; crucially , this leads to mean velocities , both of the particle and of the surrounding fluid , that are comparable to the wave velocities .",
    "these large mean velocities , and hence mean displacements necessitate to introduce coordinates that follow the motion of the particle . defining @xmath145 , we rewrite the navier  stokes equations ( [ 012])([015 ] ) in these coordinates , noting that @xmath146 and @xmath147 to obtain    [ nsmod ] @xmath148    where we have omitted the subscripts @xmath149 from @xmath150 for convenience .",
    "the weak viscosity of regime ii makes it possible to use a boundary - layer approach for both the wave and mean part of the dynamics .",
    "the boundary - layer thickness is @xmath151 so that all fields need to be expanded in powers of @xmath152 according to    [ 007 ] @xmath153    where @xmath6 and @xmath154 are constants .",
    "we anticipate that @xmath52 depends on the slow time @xmath155 only , but all the other variables depend on both @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath83 , @xmath85 and @xmath84 have both oscillatory and mean contributions : we separate these two contributions using the notation @xmath156      we now obtain the form of the leading - order wave fields . substituting ( [ 007 ] ) into ( [ nsmod ] ) and the equation of state , and subtracting the mean contribution , we find the leading - order wave equations    [ wgeii ] @xmath157    with boundary conditions    [ wbcii ] @xmath158    where @xmath159 denotes the sphere centred at origin .",
    "the equation for the sphere becomes @xmath160 eqs .",
    "( [ wgeii ] ) are the familiar equations for inviscid acoustic waves which can be solved in terms of a potential . as is standard , these equations are solved by imposing only the normal component of the boundary condition ( [ wbcii1 ] ) .",
    "the potential solution so obtained is valid to leading order for @xmath161 only .",
    "viscous effects are important in a boundary layer of thickness @xmath162 in which the velocity has a rotational contribution . the resulting velocity tangential to the sphere varies rapidly",
    "so as to both match the potential solution and satisfy the no - slip condition .",
    "it turns out that the details of the solution in the boundary layer are unimportant for the leading - order dynamics of the sphere in regime ii ; in particular , the effect of boundary streaming is @xmath106 like that of interior streaming @xcite and both contribute to the streaming velocity @xmath116 whose drag is @xmath163 hence negligible .",
    "the solution for @xmath161 is given , as in regime i , by the sum @xmath164 of the incident and scattered wave , with @xmath165 in this expression , the functions @xmath166 which appear in the far - field condition ( [ wbcii2 ] ) when this is written in terms of @xmath149 are approximated as @xmath167 .",
    "the correction involving @xmath168 is @xmath106 and negligible .",
    "note that the wavenumber can be taken as the inviscid approximation @xmath169 , assuming implicitly that the far - field condition is imposed for some @xmath149 not so large that the viscous decay ( on scales given by @xmath170 for @xmath171 , see ( [ k ] ) ) matter .",
    "this damping introduces an outer scale that can modify the streaming , which is further discussed in ",
    "the potential of the scattered wave is given by @xmath172 where the coefficients are obtained from ( [ wgeii])([wdeii ] ) as @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "this result was first obtained by king @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the mean dynamics .",

    "stokes equations ( [ nsmod ] ) , we obtain    [ 014 ] @xmath175    where @xmath176",
    ". the boundary condition is given by @xmath177 and an prescribed outer boundary condition depending on the specific application .",
    "corresponding to the wave solution , the mean flow has a boundary layer of thickness @xmath162 around the particle .",
    "we therefore analyse the mean equations ( [ 014 ] ) separately in an outer region with @xmath178 and in a boundary layer with @xmath179 .      substituting ( [ 007 ] ) into the mean mass - conservation equation ( [ mmce ] ) gives    @xmath180    which imply that both @xmath181 and @xmath182 are incompressible .",
    "similarly , the mean momentum equation ( [ mme ] ) gives    @xmath183    where ( [ 023 ] ) is used and we have defined @xmath184 consistent with the assumption that @xmath185 . assuming that @xmath186 and @xmath187 tend to constants as @xmath188 , we conclude that @xmath186 and @xmath187 are constant in the outer region .",
    "the key equation is ( [ 031 ] ) which describes the mean dynamics in the outer region ; its boundary conditions are obtained by considering the boundary layer .",
    "this region is defined by @xmath189 . denoting the dependent variables regarded as functions of @xmath190 and @xmath87 by capital letters , we obtain from the mass conservation ( [ mmce ] ) that    [ messcon ] @xmath191    eq .  ( [ 028 ] ) indicates that @xmath192 is independent of @xmath190 across the boundary layer : @xmath193 . the mean momentum conservation ( [ mme ] )",
    "gives    @xmath194    when ( [ 028 ] ) is used .",
    "we conclude from ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) that @xmath195 and @xmath196 are constant across the boundary layer , so that @xmath186 and @xmath187 are constant throughout the fluid .",

    "this implies that @xmath204 is independent of @xmath190 across the boundary layer . as a result",
    ", the outer velocity satisfies the simple boundary condition @xmath205    the momentum equation obtained at the next order , @xmath206 , can be reduced using ( [ 028 ] ) and ( [ 029 ] ) to    [ ii3/2 ] @xmath207    where the mass conservation ( [ messcon ] ) and wave solutions have been used . here",
    "@xmath208 and @xmath209 denote potential and rotational contributions to the wave velocity @xmath210 .",
    "since , as discussed above , the potential part satisfies the no - normal flow condition , the term involving these contributions vanishes . using the constancy of @xmath211 and ( [ vvx ] ) reduces ( [ ii3/2 ] ) to    @xmath212    therefore , @xmath213 , where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are obtained by matching as @xmath216 and @xmath217 . taking the @xmath190 derivative of ( [ 029 ] ) yields @xmath218 , which implies @xmath219 after matching .",
    "therefore , ( [ 030 ] ) reduces to @xmath220 so that @xmath221 is @xmath190-independent in the boundary layer .",
    "the above calculation provides us with two important pieces of information : ( i ) the @xmath222 velocity and @xmath223 pressure are @xmath190-independent ; and ( ii ) the @xmath224 velocity depends linearly on @xmath190 . from this",
    ", we conclude that the stress is constant across the boundary layer up to @xmath225 corrections . as a result , the leading - order particle motion , which depends only on the @xmath106 stress ,",
    "can be computed from the outer solution alone .",
    "the previous two sections conclude that the mean dynamics is controlled by the incompressible - fluid momentum equation ( [ 031 ] ) and the mean particle equation @xmath226 that arises when ( [ 007 ] ) is introduced into ( [ newton ] ) .",
    "these two equations are coupled through the mean stress tensor @xmath227 , defined by @xmath228 and through the no - slip condition ( [ vvx ] ) satisfied by @xmath181 .",
    "we now recast these equations in a simpler form and discuss the physical mechanism they describe .    the effect of the waves on the particle is implicit in ( [ iisph ] ) : it arises through changes in @xmath221 and @xmath229 that are induced by the presence of wave terms in the momentum equation ( [ 031 ] ) .",
    "we can make the effect of the waves explicit in ( [ iisph ] ) by writing these terms using the wave potential in the outer region@xcite to obtain    @xmath230    it is therefore natural to redefine pressure as @xmath231 leading to the simpler momentum equation @xmath232 the advection term @xmath233 in the above equation can be eliminated by using the spatial coordinates @xmath234 which can be identified with the original , fixed - frame coordinates @xmath39 , as the second equality indicates .",

    "the boundary conditions for ( [ 033 ] ) become @xmath240 together with a condition on the outer of the fluid region , at infinity for instance .",
    "the latter boundary condition is naturally expressed in terms of the lagrangian - mean velocity which , in particular , vanishes on the surface of oscillating wavemakers @xcite .",
    "this velocity can be identified with @xmath181 , however , since the stokes drift is @xmath106 hence negligible .",
    "the force in ( [ ivf ] ) is that obtained for a purely inviscid fluid and used , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for this force in terms of the coefficients @xmath95 in the expansion ( [ incexp ] ) of the incident wave are given in refs .   and , in the long - wave limit @xmath241 , in ref .",
    "note that gorkov uses an integration over a large sphere rather over the particle itself , replacing @xmath242 by @xmath243 and taking advantage of the divergence - free property of the mean inviscid stress tensor ( the integrand ) . in our case , because the mean flow is affected by viscosity and acts on the particle through the first two terms on the right - hand side of ( [ 004 ] ) , this technique is not as useful .    to summarise , in regime ii , the slow , averaged dynamics is controlled by the coupled system ( [ 033])([nonsli ] ) .",
    "in this system , viscosity enters only in the navier  stokes equation governing the fluid motion and not in the acoustic pressure .",

    "we restrict our attention to the basset limit @xcite where @xmath247 is small enough that the advection terms can be treated perturbatively .",

    "the coefficients @xmath250 can be associated with distinct physical effects : added mass , acoustic pressure , stokes drag , and the ( history - dependent ) basset force",
    ".    we solve ( [ 024 ] ) with @xmath251 and @xmath252 using laplace transform ( see appendix [ appf ] for details ) .",
    "the solution is the sum of exponentially damped oscillations and a continuous - spectrum contribution .",
    "this controls the @xmath253 asymptotics , given by @xmath254 as in regime i , the particle tends to its equilibrium position at the node @xmath255 of the standing wave .",
    "the differences are that the process is not monotonic , with the particle oscillating around the node , and is much slower than in regime i , with a @xmath256 decay of the distance to the node rather than the exponential decay of regime i. this is illustrated in figure [ fig:2 + 1modes ] .     as a function of @xmath29 for a standing wave in the basset limit of regime ii obtained by solving ( [ 024 ] ) analytically ( solid line , see appendix [ appf ] ) and numerically ( dashed line ) .",

    "we now briefly consider intermediate regimes which can be regarded as sublimits of regimes i and ii ; these apply over broad regions of the @xmath264 space and yield much simplified governing equations .",
    "these intermediate regimes are listed in table [ regtab ] together with the asymptotic inequalities that define them .",
    "a particularly important regime from the theoretical viewpoint is defined by @xmath265 which marks the transition between regimes i and ii . by showing that the mean equation in this transition regime is the limit of those in both regime i and regime ii",
    ", we confirm that our heuristic arguments in section2 identify all possible distinguished regimes .",

    "this motivated our separation between @xmath268 and @xmath267 in ( [ forcei ] ) .",
    "physically , these terms describe two very different effects .",
    "the first is a linear ( stokes ) drag controlled by the moving boundary ; the second is controlled by the average wave momentum flux and pressure which are bounded as @xmath266 . as a result , ( [ meandyi ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath269 this simple balance is important for practical purpose since it allows for the possibility of particles following fluid elements as is required when using tracer particles ; we this discuss this point further in section[sphfol ] .",
    "we now show that the regimes i and ii overlap : specifically , the small - viscosity limit of regime i matches the large - viscosity limit of regime ii in a transition regime where both streaming velocity and particle acceleration are negligible .",
    "starting from regime i , we let @xmath270 in ( [ meandyi ] ) : the acoustic pressure then reduces to its inviscid form , while the viscous drag term @xmath130 becomes negligible , leading to the balance @xmath271    conversely , letting @xmath272 in the mean momentum equation of regime ii , ( [ 033 ] ) , reduces this to the stokes equation @xmath273 since @xmath274 , @xmath229 is a stokes flow around the spherical particle and the associated stress ( first two terms on the right - hand side of ( [ 004 ] ) ) is the familiar linear stokes drag . since , furthermore , the particle s acceleration is negligible , ( [ trandy ] ) is recovered .",
    "we now consider the limit where viscosity is so small as to be negligible in both the acoustic pressure and flow equation .",
    "letting @xmath275 in ( [ 033 ] ) yields the euler equation @xmath276 assuming a potential mean flow @xmath277 , the pressure is expressed as @xmath278 the force on the particle associated with this pressure ( first term on the right - hand side of ( [ 004 ] ) ) is the well - known added - mass effect ( e.g. ref . ) .",
    "this reduces ( [ 004 ] ) to @xmath279 where the added mass @xmath280 .",
    "this provides a consistent derivation of the added - mass effect incorporated by @xcite in an _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "rigid spherical particles are often used in experiments as passive tracers to visualise and quantify fluid motion .",
    "it is therefore important to find conditions that ensure the spherical particles follow closely the motion of the fluid elements they are meant to trace , without being disturbed by the scattering induced by the rigid particle itself . in the presence of acoustic waves , fluid elements move ( on average ) with the lagrangian mean velocity , so the conditions should ensure that @xmath281 up to negligible errors . here",
    "@xmath282 is the displacement of fluid elements associated with the incident wave only .",
    "we now show that sufficient conditions for this are that @xmath283    the first condition places the dynamics in the large - viscosity regime discussed in section [ larvisreg ] in which the acoustic pressure is negligible so that @xmath284 .",
    "the second condition ensures that the average over the sphere in ( [ tildev ] ) is a good approximation to the value of the integrand at the centre of the sphere .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath285 to ensure that the second term in ( [ tildev ] ) approximates the stokes drift associated with the incident wave .    to show this , we consider the leading - order particle velocity @xmath286 \\e^{-i\\omega t},\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath287 and @xmath288 given explicitly by @xcite .",
    "it can be checked that @xmath289 leads to @xmath290 and , using the asymptotics of spherical bessel functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that @xmath291 leads to @xmath292 .",
    "therefore the velocity of the sphere reduces to @xmath293 . to leading order , this coincides with the radial velocity of the incident wave : indeed ,",
    "for @xmath291 thisvelocity is dominated by the mode @xmath294 in the expansion ( [ incexp0 ] ) while the scattered wave is negligible , again because @xmath292 and @xmath290 .",
    "it follows that @xmath295 .",
    "similarly , the wave velocity around the sphere is dominated by the incident component , hence @xmath296 .",
    "in this paper , we examine the dynamics of a spherical particle in an axisymmetric acoustic field and derive simplified models governing the mean motion of the particle .",
    "this is controlled by the complex interaction of the particle with both the wave and the surrounding fluid .",
    "specifically , four physical effects come into play : inertia ( of the particle and of the fluid it entrains ) , viscous drag , acoustic streaming , and acoustic pressure . under the assumption @xmath297 , or more accurately @xmath298 for @xmath69 , of a particle that is of the same order as or smaller than the acoustic wavelength",
    ", our analysis shows that these four effects are never concurrent . depending on the strength of viscosity ( measured by the parameter @xmath1 ) relative to the wave amplitude , several regimes , characterised by the balance between two or three of these effects , are possible .",
    "these are listed in table [ regtab ] and we briefly summarise their main features below .    fixing the radius of the particle , the relevant regime is determined by the value of viscosity . for large viscosity , the particle is driven by a viscous response to the streaming velocity , with negligible acoustic pressure and inertia , leading to ( [ largevis ] ) .",
    "as viscosity decreases , the drag effect decreases and acoustic pressure becomes significant , leading to the three - term balance between drag , streaming and acoustic pressure of regime i and the more complex model ( [ meandyi ] ) for @xmath299 . for smaller viscosity still , the streaming effect becomes negligible so that viscous drag balances acoustic pressure , yielding eq .",
    "( [ trandy ] ) .",
    "importantly , in this ` transition regime ' viscosity is weak enough for the acoustic pressure to be well approximated by its inviscid form . when viscosity is such that @xmath300 , particle inertia comes into play .",
    "this is regime ii , where inertia , fluid stress ( associated with both pressure and viscosity ) and ( inviscid ) acoustic pressure balance .",
    "this is a rather complex regime in which the mean dynamics of the particle and of the fluid are fully coupled and the navier ",
    "stokes equations need to be solved to determine the fluid stress acting on the particle .",
    "the mean equations of motion are then ( [ 033])([nonsli ] ) .",
    "finally , for very weak viscosity , the fluid motion is governed by the euler equation and , under the assumption of a potential flow , its impact reduces to the familiar added - mass effect , leading to ( [ smavis ] ) .",
    "regimes i and ii are of particular importance because they correspond to distinguished , three - term balances , and encompass the other regimes as specific sublimits .",
    "it is interesting to note that various acoustic microfluidic experiments span a range of parameters and hence a range of regimes .",
    "we have estimated the parameters used in several experiments that employ particles for a variety of purposes in order to assess which dynamical regime is relevant to each .",
    "the experiments of @xcite use spherical particles to trace the mixing flow generated by time - dependent acoustic streaming .",
    "the key non - dimensional parameters are approximately @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "this places these experiments in the transition regime and indicates that acoustic pressure could affect the particle and cause their trajectories to depart from those of fluid elements .",
    "however , for these experiments , the streaming velocity is substantially larger than our estimate , @xmath106 non - dimensionally or @xmath303 dimensionally : as discussed in ref .",
    "( for @xmath304 in problems where the wave amplitudes vary over an outer scale @xmath305 that differs from @xmath3 ( e.g. , for weakly damped travelling wave ) , the streaming velocity is @xmath306 . in such cases ,",
    "the viscous drag can dominate the acoustic pressure even though @xmath1 is not large . in the particle collection experiments of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the values of @xmath1 are @xmath24 ( 1.28 , 0.190.33 and 0.520.64 , respectively ) , placing the experiments in regime i. interestingly ,",
    "@xcite observe concentration times proportional to @xmath307 , consistent with ( [ egi ] ) . in another set of particle collection experiments , @xcite use a broader range of particle diameter ,",
    "such that @xmath308 $ ] . estimating their wave amplitudes be in the range @xmath309",
    "$ ] , we conclude that the experiments span both regimes i and ii .",
    "while this paper concentrates on spherical particles that are of the same order as or smaller than the wavelength , we can sketch how the analysis could be extended to larger particles , with @xmath310 for @xmath71 .",
    "the main difference for the balance of terms in the equation governing the particle motion is the order of magnitude of the acoustic pressure . recall that in the heuristic model ( [ guessdyeq ] ) , this was taken to be @xmath106 , corresponding to the dimensional estimate @xmath311 and to the assumption that the length scale for the change of momentum flux over the sphere is proportional to @xmath67 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "this scale is instead controlled by the size of the particle itself , leading to the estimates @xmath312 and @xmath313 for the dimensional and non - dimensional acoustic pressure .",
    "revisiting the arguments of section[regimes ] about the balance of terms in ( [ guessdyeq ] ) with this new estimate for the acoustic pressure gives the following .",
    "a distinguished regime involving all the four terms in ( [ guessdyeq ] ) is possible and corresponds to @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "this is the most general regime from which sublimits can be deduced . in particular , for @xmath316 and @xmath74 , the dominant balance is between viscous drag , streaming and acoustic pressure , and our regime i is recovered .",
    "similarly , for @xmath317 , the balance is between the particle inertia , viscous drag and radiation pressure , analogous to our regime ii .",
    "detailed calculations would however necessary to evaluate the acoustic pressure and assess whether the models we derive for @xmath69 remain unchanged for @xmath71 .",
    "other extensions of the present work could include the effects of particle compressibility , heat conduction ( both of which have already been accounted for in calculations of acoustic pressure @xcite ) and slip boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the impact of an outer scale @xmath305 of variation of the wave amplitude that differs substantially from the wavelength is relevant to many applications and also deserves consideration .",
