    "when @xmath8 is a stochastic process , to find the hausdorff dimension of these sets , denoted by @xmath9 for @xmath10 , is a classical and important question in probability and geometric measure theory .",
    "the original works on these questions could be traced back to 1953 ,  @xcite by lvy or  @xcite by taylor , regarding the hausdorff dimension and the hausdorff measure of the range of brownian motion . since then",
    ", many progresses have been made in this subject for fractional brownian motions , stable lvy processes and many other processes and functions @xcite ( see also the survey paper  @xcite and the references therein ) .    as a typical example , in  @xcite kahane studies the fractional brownian motion @xmath11 , i.e. , given @xmath12 , the unique centered continuous gaussian process satisfying @xmath13 and @xmath14 for any @xmath15 .",
    "he shows that for any compact set @xmath16 , almost surely @xmath17 and if @xmath18 , then there exists a random open set @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21    notice that here @xmath12 is the ( single ) hlder exponent of the function @xmath22 and it is uniform on @xmath3 , indeed @xmath22 is a monofractal on @xmath23 .",
    "when the function is not monofractal , a natural parallel to the above formulas is to take @xmath24 , the set of points at which the pointwise hlder exponents of @xmath1 are all equal to a constant @xmath25 , and to verify formulas like @xmath26 and @xmath27 the set @xmath28 and its hausdorff dimension @xmath29 naturally appeared in the multifractal analysis of functions , which consists in computing the singularity spectrum @xmath30 .",
    "this , together with the above parallel formulas , leads us to consider the following graph , range and level set singularity spectra : @xmath31 to our best knowledge , such singularity spectra have not been considered before .      at first",
    ", it is natural to seek for general upper bounds for these new singularity spectra .",
    "such bounds can be found thanks to the following generalization of lemma 8.2.1 in  @xcite , theorem 6 of chapter 10 in  @xcite and lemma 2.2 in  @xcite .",
    "first we note that the pointwise hlder exponent considered in this paper is defined by @xmath32 which covers the definition of the lower local dimension @xmath33 of a measure @xmath34 support on an interval @xmath35 $ ] if we set @xmath36)$ ] for @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "also , we should introduce the level set of @xmath1 over set @xmath3 in @xmath38-direction ( since in this paper we can only show the level set singularity spectrum in  lebesgue almost every direction \" ) : for @xmath39 denote by @xmath40 the line in @xmath41 passing through the origin and making an angle @xmath38 with the @xmath7-axis ( clockwise ) . for any @xmath42 , denote by @xmath43 the line perpendicular to @xmath40 , passing through @xmath7 .",

    "then for each @xmath46 , the level set of @xmath1 over the set @xmath3 in @xmath38-direction is defined by @xmath47 .",
    "notice that the typical level set @xmath48 is just the level set @xmath49 when @xmath50 .",
    "denote by @xmath51 the packing dimension .",
    "we have the following theorem :    [ upper ]    let @xmath3 be any subset of @xmath2 .",

    "these upper bounds are strongly related to the classical singularity spectrum @xmath63 ( see corollary [ upperspec ] ) .    from the multifractal analysis of functions we know that @xmath63 has a general upper bound given by the legendre transform of the so - called scaling function or @xmath64-spectrum of @xmath1 , defined by @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the oscillation of @xmath1 over @xmath67 and the supremum is taken over all the families of disjoint closed intervals @xmath67 of radius @xmath68 with centers in @xmath69 . due to @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath70 a negative dimension meaning that @xmath28 is empty .",

    "?    in general the answer is negative .",
    "we can easily find a counterexample in case when @xmath1 is a monofractal function , that is @xmath76 is equal to a constant @xmath12 for all @xmath77 .",
    "suppose , moreover , that the whole graph @xmath78 is irregular , that is its hausdorff and lower box - counting dimensions are different .",
    "we have : @xmath79 such examples can be found in  @xcite .",
    "to the contrary , if the whole graph is regular ( like for the fractional brownian motion mentioned before ) , then @xmath80 .",
    "however , monofractal examples clearly represent a very restrictive class for our purpose .",
    "simple multifractal examples are the following : consider @xmath81)$ ] for @xmath82 $ ] , where @xmath34 is a probability measure fully supported by @xmath83 $ ] , and assume that @xmath1 obeys the multifractal formalism with the exponent @xmath84 defined by @xmath85}|f(s)-f(t)|\\big),\\ ] ] whenever it exists .",
    "this property holds whenever @xmath34 is a gibbs or a random cascade measure @xcite . then by using the results in  @xcite on the multifractal analysis of the inverse measure @xmath86 carried by the range of @xmath1 ,",
    "it is easy to check that the upper bounds in corollary  [ upperspec ] give the exact dimensions .",
    "but there , the graph and range singularity spectra are always a combination of the singularity spectra of @xmath34 and @xmath87 , and the level set spectrum is trivial since @xmath1 is an increasing function .",
    "it is an interesting question to find examples of multifractal functions whose graph , range and level set singularity spectra can be calculated and are not trivial in the above sense . in this paper",
    "we consider the so - called @xmath0-adic independent cascade function introduced in  @xcite as an extension to random functions of statistically self - similar measures introduced in @xcite .",
    "we obtain the graph and range singularity spectra for this class of random functions , in the so - called non - conservative case .",
    "the level set singularity spectrum is still open .",
    "however , inspired by the classical marstrand theorem ( see @xcite ) , we obtain the level set singularity spectrum in lebesgue almost every direction .    in a brief , the result is the following : let @xmath88 be the @xmath0-adic independent cascade function ( see figure  [ fpic ] for an illustration and see section [ badicf ] for definition )",
