    "given a compact metric space @xmath0 and a continuous map @xmath1 , the arising dynamical system can be studied from various points of view . on the one hand",

    ", one can investigate the set @xmath3 of @xmath2-invariant borel probability measures and study measure theoretic aspects of the dynamics . both sides",
    "are closely linked with each other .",
    "this link is characterized by the thermodynamic formalism and specified by the topological pressure functional ( see  @xcite for full details ) . given a continuous function @xmath4 , its topological pressure @xmath5 is defined in purely topological terms . it can be expressed in measure - theoretic terms via the variational principle @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the entropy of the measure @xmath8 .",
    "the set @xmath3 equipped with the weak topology forms a compact convex space that can have an extremely complicated structure .",
    "it is natural to aim for a closer understanding of this structure .",
    "one way is to characterize measures that are `` relevant '' and  designated \" in a certain sense , for example , to focus on equilibrium measures .",
    "an invariant measure @xmath9 is said to be an _ equilibrium measure _ or _ equilibrium state _ of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath2 if it attains the supremum in the variational principle   ( the measure @xmath9 maximizes what is sometimes also called the _ free energy _ of the _ potential _",
    "@xmath10 ) .",
    "note that an equilibrium state @xmath9 for the zero potential @xmath11 is a measure of maximal entropy . to show existence and uniqueness and to establish further specific properties of equilibrium measures are among the main problems in the thermodynamic formalism . on the other hand ,",
    "particularly interesting are examples where existence or uniqueness fails . in many cases",
    "the coexistence of equilibrium states for some given potential is closely related to so - called phase transitions . following nowadays standard notation , we say that the pressure function @xmath12 , @xmath13 , exhibits a _ phase transition _ at a characteristic parameter @xmath14 if it fails to be real analytic at @xmath14 .",
    "we say that it has a _ first order phase transition _ at @xmath14 if it fails to be differentiable at @xmath14 .",
    "one major line of research in the thermodynamic formalism considers abstract dynamical systems such as markov shifts and potentials with a certain regularity .",
    "see the classical texts by ruelle  @xcite and bowen  @xcite as well as the collection by sarig  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present paper we focus on _ smooth _ dynamical systems",
    ".    we will follow a classical approach to analyze smooth systems by studying their `` basic pieces '' . in the realm of uniformly hyperbolic dynamics",
    "such pieces are formed by the _ basic sets _ ( sets that are compact , invariant , uniformly hyperbolic , topologically transitive , and locally maximal ) . beyond uniformly hyperbolic dynamics",
    "a natural line of generalization is the investigation of _ homoclinic classes _ ( such sets are topologically transitive and contain a dense subset of hyperbolic periodic points , see definition  [ def : homcla ] ) .    loosely speaking ,",
    "when a system dynamically splits into basic pieces then this should also be reflected by the structure of its  dual \" @xmath3 .",
    "certainly , if a system has several transitive components ( though they could be intermingled ) then this will be reflected dynamically .",
    "dobbs  @xcite , for example , explains the mechanism that gives rise to phase transitions related to non - transitive behavior in renormalizable unimodal maps .",
    "if , however , a dynamical system is topologically transitive but there exist pieces that are `` exposed '' in a sense that dynamically and topologically they form extreme points then we still can observe the phenomenon of phase transitions and coexistence of equilibrium states . to further support this point of view",
    "we will discuss some examples and explain what we mean by  exposed \" .",
    "one well - understood case is when the transitive dynamics `` splits '' into a hyperbolic piece and a nonhyperbolic piece .",
    "let us recall those examples of interval maps @xmath2 and the classically considered potential @xmath15 . in the example of manneville and pomeau  @xcite the interval",
    "@xmath16 $ ] splits into the single parabolic fixed point @xmath17 and the remaining set @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the pressure @xmath19 exhibits a phase transition at @xmath20 that is related to a coexistence of the dirac measure @xmath21 and an acip ( absolutely continuous invariant probability measure ) as equilibrium states . in the case of the chebyshev polynomial @xmath22 the interval @xmath16 $ ]",
    "is transitive and exposes the post - critical fixed point @xmath17 ( though the potential fails to be continuous due to the singularity ) and exhibits a phase transition at @xmath23 .",
    "an example of bruin  @xcite discusses quadratic maps with ( several ) ergodic measures supported on minimal cantor sets with zero lyapunov exponents that are coexisting with an acip .",
    "note that in all these examples the nonhyperbolic part has zero entropy .",
    "see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) ,  @xcite , and  @xcite for further discussion .    of similar spirit",
    "are the examples of the julia set @xmath24 of a polynomial or rational exceptional map @xmath2 on the complex plane discussed by makarov and smirnov in  @xcite . here , the julia set possesses periodic points that are `` dynamically exposed '' in the sense that they are immediately post - critical ( there is no branch of preimages dense in @xmath25 and disjoint with critical points , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "chebyshev polynomials of degree @xmath26 are particular examples . in each of these cases",
    "the post - critical set is finite and thus carries only measures with zero entropy .",
    "those measures are equilibrium states associated to a phase transition of the pressure function @xmath27 at a characteristic parameter . in the present paper we present examples of local diffeomorphisms",
    "@xmath28 with a locally maximal nonhyperbolic set @xmath29 that is at the same time a homoclinic class . we do not aim for generality but instead try to provide the simplest example possible .",
    "for that we choose a map that is a skew - product of interval diffeomorphisms over a smale horseshoe with three legs .",
    "although the dynamics on @xmath0 is topologically transitive , the spectrum of the lyapunov exponents associated to the one - dimensional central direction @xmath30 contains positive and negative values and has a gap . in this example",
    "the potential @xmath31 is continuous and equilibrium states for @xmath32 exist for every @xmath13 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral gap is immediately related to a phase transition of the pressure function @xmath12 at some characteristic parameter @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath33 there exist two equilibrium states both of positive entropy ( we call this a _ rich phase transition _ ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first example of a phase transition in a topologically transitive local diffeomorphism associated to several equilibrium states with positive entropy .",
    "this work is an extension of  @xcite where topological properties and phase transitions related to homoclinic classes are studied . in these examples",
    "the exposed sets are single fixed points .    inside the locally maximal set @xmath0",
    "coexist intermingled sets of different type of hyperbolicity which can be seen , for example , from the coexistence of periodic points with unstable manifolds of different dimensions .",
    "however , there exists a measure of maximal entropy with nonpositive central lyapunov exponent .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the dynamics on @xmath0 is not predominantly expanding .",
    "moreover , in some parameter range this measure is unique and its central exponent is negative .    besides these dynamical features , our examples possess also topologically a rich structure of the fibers of the skew - product map . following the approach in  @xcite",
    ", one can show that there exists uncountably many fibers that contain a single point only and uncountably many fibers that contain a continuum .",
    "let us briefly explain to what corresponds an  exposed piece of dynamics \" in our example .",
    "we consider genuinely nonhyperbolic homoclinic classes @xmath0 containing infinitely many hyperbolic periodic points of different type .",
    "although this class is transitive , it properly contains a  lateral \" horseshoe @xmath34 whose saddles are not homoclinically related to periodic hyperbolic points outside @xmath35 .",
    "this lateral horseshoe is a kind of extreme of @xmath0 .",
    "one of the equilibrium states involved in the phase transition is supported on the horseshoe @xmath35 that has positive central lyapunov exponents and positive entropy .",
    "the other coexisting state lives on @xmath36 and also has positive entropy .",
    "let us conclude with a heuristic remark .",
    "that a homoclinic classes is properly contained in a bigger one seems to be the underlying mechanism for the gap in the spectrum and hence for the phase transition .",
    "however , this configuration is somehow atypical . indeed , for typical @xmath37 diffeomorphisms homoclinic classes either are disjoint or coincide  @xcite and the spectrum of lyapunov exponents has no gaps  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we provide the details of our example in section  [ s:2 ] . in section  [ s:3 ]",
