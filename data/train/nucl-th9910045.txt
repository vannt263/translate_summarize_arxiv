    "at low energies up to few tenth of mev very few partial waves are sufficient to describe nn scattering . however , at intermediate ( a few hundred mev ) and higher energies many partial waves are needed .",
    "besides in this energy region the scattering amplitude for a high partial wave oscillates strongly in angle .",
    "this suggests t - matrix calculations using directly the momentum vectors .",
    "one - boson - exchange nn potentials are derived in momentum space . instead of using spin operators with a fixed quantisation axis",
    "often these potentials are formulated in helicity representation . moreover , in high energy region taking relativity into account is unavoidable .",
    "thereby , using spin components along a fixed direction is more complicated than using helicities [ 1 ] .",
    "there are some works [ 2 - 4 ] preceding ours , which address formulations without partial waves and one of them [ 3 ] even using helicities .",
    "we propose a modified form of equations in comparison to [ 3 ] .",
    "we present here the formalism for the two nucleon system avoiding partial waves and using helicities .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe the lippmann - schwinger equations as well as the basis states and the physical t - matrix . in sect .",
    "3 we show the operators to express nn potentials . in sect .",
    "4 we show the relation between the partial wave t - matrix and the helicity t - matrix . we conclude in sect . 5 .",
    "to calculate observables we need t - matrix elements .",
    "firstly we define basis states based on which t - matrix elements are calculated by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the basis states are @xmath0 which are antisymmetric choosing @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are relative momenta , total spin , total helicity , parity operator and parity eigenvalue , respectively .    based on these basis states the t - matrix element is defined as @xmath8 for @xmath9 one can show @xmath10 where @xmath11 obeys a set of coupled lippmann - schwinger equations : @xmath12 with @xmath13 for @xmath14 it is a single equation but for @xmath15 it is a set of two coupled equations .",
    "we need to solve it only for helicities @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "figure 1 shows a three dimensional plot of the real part of the half - shell t - matrix for s = 1 , parity = even , @xmath18 , @xmath19 at @xmath20 = 100 mev .",
    "the physical t - matrix for spin - magnetic and isospin quantum numbers @xmath21 , @xmath22 is calculated using the following relation : @xmath23",
    "we need potentials given in operator form . for the example of obepr",
    "there are five types of operators , called @xmath24 operators in [ 3 ] , which can not be applied directly to our basis states .",
    "we take the six @xmath25 operators from [ 3 ] for which this application is possible , but we redefined @xmath26 so that @xmath27 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 operators is then @xmath28",
    "from the helicity t - matrix we can calculate the partial wave t - matrix .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "we calculated phase shifts from the t - matrix ( [ one ] ) using the bonn obepr potential [ 5 ] .",
    "they are shown in table 1 together with those calculated using partial wave decomposition .",
    "we have formulated a method to carry out scattering process calculations of the two nucleon system without partial wave decomposition in helicity representation . with this method we can reduce the algebraic and numerical work drastically .",
    "we need to solve only one set of lippmann - schwinger equations instead of solving many for all partial waves .",
    "the results of phase shift calculation shows that this method works well .",
    "we would like to thank charlotte elster from ohio university , athens , ohio for fruitfull discussions and assistance .",
