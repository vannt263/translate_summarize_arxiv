    "observations of the diffuse component of x - rays ( e.g. snowden 1995 ) indicate that hot components of temperatures higher than @xmath0 k occupy a considerable volume of the interstellar space .",
    "these hot components may be generated by supernova remnants ( snrs ) , stellar winds and magnetic heating .",
    "x - rays from galactic ridge ( grxe ; galactic ridge x - ray emission ; see discussion ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , for example , can not be fully explained by the point sources such as snrs and stellar winds ( @xcite ) .",
    "we study the magnetic heating in interstellar space in this paper .",
    "the mean strength of interstellar magnetic field is several @xmath1 g ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field has random components and generates possibly many current sheets at all scales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "parker ( 1992 ) pointed out the importance of magnetic reconnection for the heating of galactic plasma ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental intrinsic property of agitated magnetized , turbulent plasma . whenever the magnetic fields collide with another field with different direction by , for example , the shear motion , magnetic energy is rapidly dissipated . outside the forming current sheet the magnetic field lines are frozen - in to the interstellar gas , which is provided by the high electrical conductivity . when the oppositely directed field lines collide with each other , the field gradient steepens and the current density increases until strong dissipation sets in ( e.g. via anomalous resistivity ) to trigger fast reconnection ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the reconnection heats the interstellar gas by releasing interstellar magnetic energy , and accelerates it by magnetic tension force to alfvn velocity , forming interstellar jets .",
    "the magnetic reconnection plays an important role as observed in solar flares by x - ray satellite _ yohkoh _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in substorms by satellite such as _ geotail _ ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the solar atmosphere",
    ", the magnetic reconnection heats the plasma from a temperature of several @xmath2 k to several @xmath3 k ( sometimes several @xmath4 k ) , and accelerates it to @xmath5 km s@xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if an explosion such as a supernova compresses the current sheet , magnetic reconnection occurs and heats interstellar gas .",
    "historically , the steady reconnection mechanisms were proposed on the basis of analytical studies . in the sweet(1958)-parker(1957 ) type reconnection , the diffusion region is so long as to occupy whole current system .",
    "therefore , the stored magnetic energy is released by ohmic heating , which can hardly be applied to solar flare phenomena , because the reconnection rate of the sweet - parker model is too small ( @xmath7 ) in the solar corona , where @xmath8 is magnetic reynolds number ( @xmath9 ) . on the other hand , in the petschek(1964 )",
    "type reconnection , the diffusion region is localized near an x - point , and standing slow shocks occupy whole current systems . in the configuration ,",
    "the motor effect associated with slow shocks is much more dominant than ohmic heating , which can hence be applicable to solar flare phenomena , because the reconnection rate of the petschek model is @xmath10 , independent of @xmath8 when @xmath8 is large .",
    "this is called `` fast reconnection '' .",
    "two models have been suggested to clarify how the fast reconnection can be realized .",
    "one is so - called `` externally driven fast reconnection model '' , which predicts that the fast reconnection should be controlled by boundary conditions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the other is so - called `` spontaneous fast reconnection model '' , which predicts that the fast reconnection mechanism spontaneously develops from inside the system by self - consistent interaction between plasma microscopic processes ( current - driven anomalous resistivities ) and macroscopic reconnection flows ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the magnetic reconnection triggered by a supernova by performing two dimensional ( 2d ) numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations including the electric resistivity .",
    "many mhd numerical simulations have been performed for magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some similar attempts have been made in the model of intracluster medium ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , galactic halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and protostar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic reconnection occurs at numerous current sheets in galactic disk and halo , which may be called `` galactic flare '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , tanuma et al .  ( 1999 ) performed numerical simulations and suggested that the magnetic reconnection can generate the galactic - ridge x - ray emission ( see section [ grxe ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we solve the 2d resistive mhd equations numerically to see how the magnetic reconnection occurs when a supernova triggers the magnetic reconnection in galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we analize the detailed time evolution of the reconnecting current sheet , study dependence of the results on many parameters , and apply the results to galaxy .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the method of the 2d resistive mhd numerical simulations of the magnetic reconnection triggered by a supernova as the simplest model . in section 3",
    ", we describe the results of the simulations , and we apply the results to the x - ray plasmas in galaxy in section 4 . in the last section , we summarize this paper .",
    "the magnetic reconnection occurs when the interstellar magnetic field collides with another magnetic field which is not exactly parallel .",
