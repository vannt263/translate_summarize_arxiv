    "solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are currently a subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "solitons supported by weak attractive interactions between atoms were created in the condensate of @xmath0li trapped in strongly elongated ( nearly one - dimensional , 1d ) traps li ( although the actual shape of the solitons was actually nearly three - dimensional , rather than nearly-1d ; the latter feature was observed in a salient form in the recent experiment @xcite , where solitons were created as a residual pattern after dynamical collapse took place in the @xmath1rb condensate ) .",
    "the stability of the solitons , with a given number of atoms , against collapse is secured , in these settings , by a combination of the trap s geometry and small absolute value of the negative scattering length characterizing the attraction between atoms ( @xmath2 nm , in the case of @xmath3li , but up to @xmath4 nm , in the condensate of @xmath5rb ) . a very accurate description of the solitons is provided by the mean - field approximation based on the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "positive scattering length , which corresponds to repulsive interactions , is more generic in bec ( in the above - mentioned experiments , the negative scattering length was actually artificially induced by means of the feshbach resonance , both in @xmath3li and @xmath5rb ) . in a repulsive condensate , _ gap solitons _ (",
    "gss ) may be created as a result of the interplay of the self - defocusing nonlinearity and periodic potential induced by an optical lattice ( ol , i.e. , an interference pattern created by counterpropagating laser beams illuminating the condensate ) @xcite .",
    "gss emerge in _ bandgaps _ of the system s linear spectrum , since the combination of a _ negative _ effective mass , appearing in a part of bands adjacent to the gaps , with the repulsive interaction is exactly what is needed to create a soliton .",
    "theoretical models for gss in bec were reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and rigorous stability analysis for them in the 1d case was developed in refs . @xcite .",
    "creation of a gs in the experiment was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in @xmath6rb condensate placed in a quasi-1d trap supplemented by a longitudinal ol ; the soliton contained a few hundred atoms .",
    "in a subsequent experiment , large - size confined states with much larger numbers of atoms were discovered in a stronger ol @xcite ; an explanation to this observation was recently proposed @xcite , which , essentially , treats the extended state as a segment of a nonlinear bloch wave , bounded by two fronts ( domain walls ) which are sustained by the strong ol ( a similar wall between filled and empty domains was predicted in bec with self - attraction in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "stable gss were also predicted in 2d and 3d settings @xcite , including 2d solitons with embedded vorticity @xcite . in nonlinear optics , similar 2d spatial solitons @xcite and 2d localized vortices @xcite",
    "were predicted in photonic crystals and photonic - crystal fibers , as well as in periodic photonic lattices induced by perpendicular laser beams in photorefractive materials @xcite . in media of the latter type ,",
    "both fundamental @xcite and vortical 2d solitons have been created in the experiment @xcite .",
    "a difference from the self - repulsive bec is the self - focusing character of the nonlinearity in nonlinear optics ( which is cubic in photonic crystals , and saturating in photorefractive media ) ; for this reason , the optical solitons usually belong to the semi - infinite bandgap , where the effective mass is always positive ( although vortex solitons in a finite gap were also created in a photorefractive medium @xcite ) .",
    "the gpe with self - attraction and periodic ( optical - lattice ) potential gives rise to 2d solitons and vortices @xcite similar to those found in the above - mentioned optical models .",
    "moreover , it has been recently demonstrated that both the gpe with the self - focusing cubic term and ol potential , and its counterpart with the saturable nonlinearity , that appertains to photorefractives , give rise to stable higher - order localized vortices ( which are built as rings of unitary vortices ) and _ supervortices _ ( similar rings with global vorticity imprinted onto them ) @xcite .",
    "_ quasiperiodic _ ols can be easily created too : in the 1d case , as a superposition of two sublattices with incommensurate periods , and in the 2d case , as a combination of @xmath7 or @xmath8 quasi-1d sublattices with wave vectors @xmath9 of equal lengths , which make equal angles @xmath10 between themselves . in particular , the 2d lattice with @xmath7 is known as the _",
    "penrose tiling _ ( pt ) .",
    "the bandgap spectrum of 2d photonic crystals of the pt type has been studied in detail @xcite , with a conclusion that true ( omnidirectional ) bandgaps may be supported by the pt .",
    "the use of quasiperiodic lattices , in one and two dimensions alike , offers new degrees of freedom that allow one to _ engineer _ desirable bandgaps in the spectrum and , this way , _ design _ soliton families in nonlinear media .",
    "several theoretical works sought for solitons in models combining quasiperiodic lattice potentials and cubic _ self - focusing_. in an early work @xcite , solitons were not found in a 1d quasiperiodic model ; however , they were later discovered in a  deterministic aperiodic \" discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which may be regarded as a limit case of the 1d model with a very strong quasiperiodic potential @xcite . localized and delocalized",
    "solutions were also studied in the 1d model with a superlattice ( i.e. , an ordinary ol subjected to an additional modulation , which is different from a quasicrystal ) @xcite . recently ,",
    "2d solitons ( with zero vorticity ) were numerically constructed in a model of a photonic crystal made of a self - focusing material , with @xmath11 , in terms of the above definition @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to find gss supported by the interplay of the cubic _ repulsive _ nonlinearity and quasiperiodic lattice potentials .",
    "we will report systematic results for fundamental solitons in the 1d and 2d models ( the latter one will be elaborated for the pt lattice ) . in the 1d case ,",
