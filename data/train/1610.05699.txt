    "laser wakefield acceleration @xcite experiments ( lwfa ) achieved gev electron energies in cm - scales using plasma waves @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore a compact synchrotron light source , that uses a laser wakefield accelerated electron beam in combination with a conventional lattice .",
    "we outline a design that produces ( water - window ) or photons and we estimate the design parameters of the compact light source , the achievable brilliance , and we discuss the feasibility and challenges of the design .",
    "our design uses the state of the art technology including a laser plasma gas - jet accelerator , a quadrupole doublet to focus and confine the beam , four 90 degree dipole bending magnets ( super - conducting or normal conducting ) to keep the beam on a periodic lattice , and a long wiggler magnet to produce the desired radiation .",
    "we do not study the radiation emitted by the bending magnets , or the betatron oscillations of the electron beam in the plasma bubble .",
    "a schematic of the design is in fig .",
    "[ schematics ] , and the investigated design criteria are detailed below :    photons produced by a electron beam and normal - conducting magnets .",
    "photons produced by a electron beam and super - conducting magnets .",
    "photons produced by a electron beam and super - conducting magnets .",
    "the laser wakefield acceleration with self - guiding and self - injection provides the electron beam for the compact ring .",
    "an intense -class ti : sapphire cpa system is injected through a window in one of the bending dipoles ( b4 in fig . [ schematics ] ) , impinges on a gas jet , ionizes the gas and creates strong plasma wakefields that accelerate the self - injected electron beam to gev - energies .",
    "the chosen laser and plasma parameters are summarized in tables [ laserparameters ] and [ plasmaparameters ] .",
    "based on existing systems , we choose laser parameters achievable in the near future @xcite .",
    "a ti : sapphire laser system with a laser wavelength of @xmath2 , a pulse duration of @xmath3 , a maximum laser power of @xmath4 , @xmath5 of energy per pulse , and a laser spot size radius of 37 m .",
    "the laser intensity @xmath6 is then approximately @xmath7 which corresponds to a laser strength parameter @xmath8 of about @xmath9 for a gaussian radial laser distribution .",
    "@xmath10}{1.37 \\times 10^{18 } } \\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\cdot \\lambda_l \\ [ \\text{\\textmu m}]\\ ] ] the chosen plasma density of the gas - jet is @xmath11 and optimizes the achievable maximum electron energy .",
    "the laser frequency @xmath12 is above the critical plasma frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the depletion @xmath14 and dephasing @xmath15 length @xcite for these laser - plasma parameters are estimated with : @xmath16 to be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , thus @xmath19 is the upper bound on our total possible acceleration length . the maximum accelerating gradient @xmath20 is estimated based on the cold plasma wave - breaking field ( [ eq : wavebreaking ] ) to be .",
    "@xmath21 this means that our target energies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be reached with an acceleration length of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 rayleigh lengths @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this acceleration length is longer than gas jets in use presently ( @xmath27 ) and may require a novel gas jet setup , particularly for the @xmath1 beam .    in this design ,",
    "we rely on analytic estimates rather than on the results of 3d simulations of the setup .",
    "consequently , for the remainder of the ring calculations we used electron beam parameters that are typically achievable with similar laser wakefield acceleration stages @xcite . the electron beam size is chosen to be @xmath2812 m .",
    "the electron energy spread is @xmath29 .",
    "the beam divergence is chosen to be @xmath30 .",
    "reasonable bunch charge for the and electron beams are and @xcite .",
    ".ti : sapphire laser parameters [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]      table [ tab : radiation ] details the radiation source parameters for all considered design versions .",
    "we choose a length of @xmath31 for the undulating magnetic field region , where the electron bunch emits an approximately -long x - ray pulse at each turn through the b3 aperture before beam loss .",
    "as shown in the table , we designed the x - ray energy @xmath32 to either be within the water window ( @xmath33 ) or to be fairly hard ( @xmath34 ) depending on the energy of the injected electron beam .",
    "the chosen parameters result in the source being near the wiggler / undulator transition or well within the wiggler regime , respectively , as can be seen by the parameter k. the brilliance per electron passage in the wiggler @xmath35 was estimated based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : brilliance ] ) : @xmath36 and the brilliance per electron lifetime @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of photons emitted per unit length ( from eq .  ( 3.22 ) of @xcite ) , @xmath40 is the number of electrons in the beam , @xmath41 is the frequency of electron injection ( ) and @xmath42 the time per revolution .",
    "the emission angles @xmath43 and @xmath44 are estimated with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    of the chosen parameter sets , the electrons with the superconducting bending magnets ( ) resulted in the largest brightness .",
    "we also want to note that these brightness estimates include only the radiation from the b3 aperture , not including the synchrotron radiation produced by b3 .",
    "one of the concerns of the re - circulating design is that the gas / plasma from the injector resides in the lattice longer than it takes the electron beam to circulate in the ring .",
    "the gas flow velocity from typical gas jets is @xmath47 @xcite , and one electron beam turn in a circumference ring takes @xmath48 .",
    "thus the gas flow advances by @xmath48 and will therefore still be in the path of the beam for much of its residence time .",
    "taking @xmath49 as ionization threshold of the plasma and assuming a radial laser size of gives a plasma channel radius of .",
    "this estimate suggests that the plasma column has already propagated far enough to eliminate the possibility of any further interaction with the beam .",
    "so , the electron beam is only likely to interact with the residual gas and not the laser - ionized plasma column .",
    "thus , the interaction process of the beam is dominated by random scattering off the gas , which leads to a divergence growth of the order of micro - rad , as opposed to a coherent lensing of the order of milli - rad by the plasma @xcite",
    ". electron beam of pc charge with a beam size of @xmath50 m and @xmath51 m is not dense enough to ionizes the gas .",
    "apart from using the radiation created by the wiggler , it would also be possible to use the radiation from the bending magnets or the x - rays produced by the betatron oscillations of the electron beam in the bubble @xcite",
    ". a compton light source could also be realized by making the electron bunch collide with a laser pulse .",
    "in this paper we proposed different design solutions for a compact ring - based x - ray source with an on - orbit and on - energy laser - plasma accelerator .",
    "we considered four 90 degrees bending magnets to keep the particles on a circular orbit and the desired radiation is created by a wiggler magnet .",
    "the peak brilliance is as high as @xmath52 .",
    "even though modern , 3rd and 4th generation , light sources routinely create a peak brilliance in the order of @xmath53 @xcite , this design can be considered attractive due to its compactness and small footprint",
    ". this design would be suitable for use in , for example , a university setting .",
    "future work should include plasma simulations to obtain better estimates for the electron beam parameters , optics optimization and particle tracking to obtain electron beam sizes , studies on the gas - jet design , further investigations on the electron scattering on the residual gas , and a more detailed description of the magnet design .          t. tajima and j. m. dawson , _ laser electron accelerator _ , http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/physrevlett.43.267[phys .",
