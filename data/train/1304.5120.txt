    "the reason for this is that minkowski spacetime is empty .",
    "there is no quantum environment in minkowski spacetime with which the scattering and decay processes could interact .",
    "another reason is that the scattering and decay processes do not interact with the minkowski spacetime itself since it has no quantum structure that , in effect , could present itself as a quantum environment .",
    "particle scattering and decay processes take place , in fact , in real physical universe .",
    "suppose that there exists a quantum environment in the universe that interacts with particle processes .",
    "such interaction can not originate in the known interactions of the standard model .",
    "these interactions would lead to observable violation of the conservation laws and render the dynamics of particle interaction inaccessible to experiment .",
    "the interaction of particle processes with the quantum environment must originate from the outside of the standard model .",
    "if the quantum environment and this new kind of interaction are to be an integral part of the nature , then they must be fully consistent with the conservation laws and unitarity of the standard model .",
    "there exists such an interaction in the nature .",
    "it is the pure dephasing interaction between a quantum system @xmath0 and a quantum environment @xmath12 which is a non - dissipative interaction that affects only the phase(s ) of the quantum system @xmath0 . in general",
    ", its effect is to change the quantum information content of the quantumm system @xmath0 . unlike the force of gravity , which has undetectable effects on particle processes",
    ", the pure dephasing interaction could be observable .",

    "is that the interaction with the environment be a final state interaction which involves only the produced state @xmath1",
    ". the non - unitary evolution of the @xmath0-matrix final state @xmath1 yields the observed non - unitary final state @xmath2 @xmath17 the effect of the pure dephasing interaction with the environment thus shall be to modify the phases of the @xmath0-matrix amplitudes in the observed amplitudes of the new state @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of the quantum environment will manifests itself in the difference between the phases of the observed and @xmath0-matrix amplitudes and therefore in an apparent violation of the unitary evolution law .    to gain information about the phases of the @xmath0-matrix",
    "amplitudes we shall use the fact that the @xmath0-matrix unitary evolution law evolves pure initial states @xmath13 into pure final states @xmath1 in exclusive processes . in two - body processes such as @xmath18",
    "this condition imposes no constraints on the amplitudes and thus no specific information about their phases .",

    "we aim to test the unitary evolution law in the pion production @xmath19 measured at cern on polarized target at 17.2 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "we develop the necessary spin formalism and show that the purity of the final state density matrix in @xmath5 processes is controlled by the recoil nucleon polarization .",
    "evolution of pure initial states to pure final states imposes 9 constraints on 16 angular intensities describing the final state . using @xmath3-parity conservation",
    "we show that all constraints are identities provided that the partial wave amplitudes satisfy the conditions @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are parity conserving nucleon transversity unnatural and natural exchange amplitutes with dipion spin , helicity and nucleon transversity @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the conditions ( 1.4 ) imply that the relative phases between any two unnatural or two natural exchange amplitudes of the same transversity @xmath25 as well as between any unnatural and natural exchange amplitudes of opposite transversities must be @xmath6 or @xmath7 . as a result ,",
    "the unnatural and natural amplitudes share a common phase @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . because strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions do not mix particles with different spins , self - consistency requires that there be no mixing of resonances of different spins in any partial wave amplitudes with such unitary phases .",
    "the elegant simplicity and uniqueness of these predictions renders the test of unitary evolution law possible using the existing cern measurements on polarized target at dipion masses below 1080 mev where @xmath0- and @xmath3-wave amplitudes dominate .",

    "recent amplitude analysis of @xmath0- and @xmath3-wave subsystem in @xmath28 at 17.2 gev / c established that the width of @xmath30 resonance peak observed in all @xmath3-wave amplitudes does not depend on its helicity @xmath31  @xcite as required by the rotational / lorentz symmetry of the @xmath0-matrix .",

    "the contrast between the predicted unitary relative phases and the observed non - unitary phases therefore presents an unambigous evidence for the non - unitary evolution of the produced final state and supports the hypothesis of the existence of the quantum environment and its pure dephasing interaction with particle scattering processes .    in a sequel paper  @xcite",
    "we show that the consistency of the pure dephasing interaction with the standard model in @xmath5 processes requires that it be a dipion spin mixing interaction the effect of which is the mixing of @xmath0-matrix partial wave amplitudes to form observable amplitudes .",

    "the issue of the experimental test of the unitary evolution law was first raised in 1974 by marinov who suggested to describe the time evolution of @xmath33 system using a model of a non - unitary evolution from pure states into mixed states  @xcite .",

    "he suggested that such non - unitary processes will occur in curved space - time , and that quantum gravity violates @xmath34 symmetry and time - reversal invariance . in 1982",
    "hawking pointed out that particle scattering does not take place in a structureless continuum of the minkowski space - time but in an environment of quantum space - time fluctuations and suggested that pure initial states of interacting particles will evolve into mixed final states due to the interaction of the particle scattering process with quantum fluctuations of the space - time metric - at any energy  @xcite .",
    "hawking questioned the universal validity of the unitary time evolution in the presence of metric fluctuations , and suggested that initial and final state density matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 are connected by a non - unitary evolution law described by a linear but non - unitary and non - invertible superscattering operator @xmath38 to avoid negative probabilities the mapping ( 1.5 ) must be completely positive .",
    "a linear mapping ( 1.5 ) is completely positive if and only if it has the form of the kraus representation ( 1.2 )  @xcite .",

    "hawking s ideas inspired attempts to test unitary evolution law experimentally .",
    "the efforts focused mainly on non - unitary time evolution of neutral kaons @xmath33 system using lindblad type evolution laws  @xcite and led to the predictions of @xmath34 violation and a modification of epr correlations  @xcite . during the recent years experiments with neutral kaons",
    "have yielded sensitive results on violations of @xmath34 symmetry , time reversal invariance and entanglement of kaon pairs  @xcite .",
    "so far these experiments did not provide a conclusive confirmation of a non - unitary evolution of free neutral kaon systems .",

    "we review and develop the spin formalism necessary to derive and discuss the constraints imposed by the unitary evolution law on the nucleon transversity amplitudes .",
    "we emphasize the coherent superposition of diparticle states and the constraints imposed by the conservation of @xmath3-parity on partial wave amplitudes .",
    "final state density matrix is defined and its properties derived in some detail . this material will be used also in the sequel paper . in section vii .",
