    "the use of feshbach resonances to vary the interactions between atoms obeying fermi statistics has become a matter of interest in the field of ultracold trapped atoms  @xcite .",
    "one reason is that these systems permit the experimental exploration of potentially strongly correlated fermi systems in which the magnitude of the scattering length @xmath1 is larger than the interparticle separation .",
    "the study of such strongly interacting fermi systems is relevant to several fields including condensed matter and nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "it is therefore important to understand in some detail the physics of atoms interacting via a feshbach resonance .",
    "theoretical studies of the two - body physics of feshbach resonances are typically performed in the context of vacuum multi - channel scattering theory using a microscopic model of the atom - atom interaction  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "studies of low energy many - body properties often require the use of effective theories with a simplified form of the atom - atom interaction in order to make calculations tractable .",
    "a precise link between such effective theories and microscopic multi - channel models is therefore crucial in order to incorporate the correct two - body physics in many - body calculations . in the atomic gas community ,",
    "effective theories are of two types . in one , the presence of closed channels is simply neglected , and only the resultant ( resonant ) scattering length is used as an input parameter .",
    "this approximation is adequate for the calculation of certain many - body properties close to broad resonances where the wave function of the feshbach molecule is dominated by atom pairs in the open channel  @xcite . in the other ,",
    "the presence of a two - body bound state in the closed channel ( which leads to the resonance ) is put in by hand in the form of a point boson  @xcite . the parameters appearing in such theories are then the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule and the molecule - atom coupling .",
    "the treatment of the bound state in the closed channels as a point boson is , however , incorrect in principle since it is really a composite two - body object .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is therefore to develop a systematic , improved low energy effective theory for the multi - channel scattering of alkali atoms in which the presence of a closed channel molecular feshbach state is not put in by hand as a point boson but rather emerges naturally as a composite object consisting of two interacting fermionic atoms .",
    "we will show that such a theory permits tractable calculations of low energy many - body properties including medium effects due to the occupation of states in the closed channels .",
    "the examination of such effects will be demonstrated to be of particular importance for the experimentally well - studied resonance of @xmath0k atoms .",
    "it will be demonstrated that our approach can be reduced to the well - known bose - fermi model when the two - fermion nature of the bare molecule in the closed channel can be ignored .",
    "this theory can be formulated in two equivalent ways : one uses the microscopic parameters describing the atom - atom interaction as input ; the other takes physical parameters describing the low energy scattering as input including the position and width of the resonance and the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule ( including the effects of dressing by the open channel ) .",
    "this provides an appealing link between the microscopic parameters often used in two - body multi - channel calculations and the physical parameters used in low energy effective many - body theories .",
    "we will use this effective theory to analyze recent rethermalization experiments on @xmath0k atoms and propose that further experimental study of rethermalization rates at higher temperatures can provide a determination of the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule .",
    "finally , the energy dependent feshbach interaction will be shown to introduce an effective range inversely proportional to the width of the resonance .",
    "this effective range can be neglected ( and universal behavior close to resonance expected ) only in the case of broad resonances .",

    "this value differs somewhat from ours ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy can be the experimental uncertainty in determining the number of atoms trapped , and/or the fact that the authors in ref .  @xcite use a different thermal averaging procedure than that given by ( [ sigmaaverage ] )  @xcite .    the fit parameters ( [ smallmupar])-([largemupar ] ) do not depend strongly on the value of the molecule magnetic moment at the temperature @xmath220k .",

    "this can easily be understood as follows . if one ignores the @xmath242 term in ( [ tvacuum ] ) , the cross section is identically zero for @xmath243 for all @xmath217 leading to a vanishing rethermalization rate .",
    "but from @xmath244 is follows from ( [ tvacuum ] ) that the minimum of the rethermalization rate at @xmath240 scales as @xmath245 for @xmath241 .",

    "we see that the position of the minimum does not depend on @xmath153 when @xmath241 whereas the magnitude of the minimum value of the rethermalization rate does .",
    "the temperature dependence of the rethermalization rate could be used to determine the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule : one can measure this magnetic moment by fitting the measured rethermalization cross section as a function of temperature using the theory described above .",
    "a scan of temperatures from @xmath241 to @xmath248 is likely to yield a fairly accurate value of @xmath153 . for @xmath241 ,",
    "the feshbach resonance gives rise to a sharp maximum and minimum in the rethermalization scattering cross section whereas for @xmath248 , the rethermalization cross section is a much smoother function of the @xmath3 field .",
    "furthermore , if one is able to measure the magnitude of the minimum rethermalization rate which is sensitive to the temperature for all @xmath249 , the size of the magnetic moment can even be determined for @xmath241 .",
    "we now demonstrate that the energy - dependent , feshbach - mediated interaction introduces a new length scale : the effective range @xmath250 . the effective range expansion for the vacuum scattering matrix is given by  @xcite @xmath251 where @xmath252 $ ] is the resonant scattering length .",
    "this expansion can be obtained from ( [ tvacuum ] ) in the limit @xmath253 with the effective range given as @xmath254 the @xmath242 term in ( [ tvacuum ] ) coming from the momentum dependence of the feshbach molecule energy can therefore introduces a new length scale : an effective range given by ( [ reff ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ reff ] ) was also derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a bose - fermi model .",
    "note that the effective range given by ( [ reff ] ) is negative as a direct consequence of the energy dependence of the multi - channel interaction . in a recent paper , finite range effects on the physics of cold atomic gases in the bec - bcs crossover regime was examined using a single channel model  @xcite .",
    "the atom - atom potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite has a positive effective range and thus does not provide a correct description of finite range effects for resonant multi - channel atom - atom scattering . similarly , the effective range of the single channel interaction used in a recent monte - carlo study also has @xmath255  @xcite . in general",
    ", it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to obtain a negative effective range in single channel models of resonant scattering .",
    "this feature emerges naturally in multi - channel models .",
    "it is common to neglect the effective range term by adopting a simple approximate form of the unitarized scattering matrix @xmath256 this approximation leads to the idea of universality . when @xmath257 , the only remaining length scale in the problem is the interparticle spacing , and the properties of the gas should therefore be independent of the microscopic details of the atom - atom interaction .",
    "the physics of interacting gases in the universal limit has been examined by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "however , we have now demonstrated explicitly that there is an additional length scale in the problem given by ( [ reff ] ) . this length scale can be neglected only when calculating properties with a typical wave length @xmath258 for which @xmath259 ; the thermodynamic properties of the gas are independent of @xmath250 only when @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the average interparticle spacing . for low temperatures where",
    "@xmath262 , using ( [ reff ] ) , this condition can be written as @xmath263 the simple unitarized form for the scattering given by ( [ tunitary ] ) therefore holds only for broad resonances as defined by ( [ unitaritycondition ] ) .",
    "in particular , one can expect universal behavior only for such broad resonances  @xcite .",
    "for the feshbach resonance for @xmath0k at @xmath264 g , we find @xmath265 g and @xmath266 as explained above .",
    "assuming @xmath267 and @xmath268k , this yields @xmath269 and one would expect the gas to exhibit universal behavior close to resonance .",
    "this is also true for the very broad resonance for @xmath146li at @xmath270 g with @xmath271 g .",
    "however , for the narrow @xmath146li resonance at @xmath272 g , @xmath151 g , and @xmath273  @xcite , we find @xmath274 for @xmath268k .",
    "one can therefore not expect the effective range to be an irrelevant length scale for this narrow resonance .",
    "a low energy effective theory for the in - medium scattering of alkali atoms was obtained using a microscopic multi - channel description of the atom - atom interaction .",
    "expressions for all scattering properties in terms of a few parameters characterizing the atom - atom potential were derived thereby providing a link between a microscopic multi - channel description of feshbach resonances and more phenomenological approaches .",
    "the presence of a feshbach resonance emerged naturally from the theory as a two - particle bound state , and the energy dependence of the feshbach - mediated interaction was shown to introduce a negative effective range inversely proportional to the width of the resonance .",
    "furthermore , medium effects arising from the occupation of both open and closed channel states were calculated .",
    "the theory was shown to allow the explicit calculation of corrections to commonly used approximations such as the neglect of the effective range and the treatment of the feshbach molecule as a point boson .",
