    "the real ultra high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( cr ) , uhecr , paradox following k. greisen , g.t .",
    "zatsepin , v.a .",
    "kuzmin , the famous gzk cut off , lays not just in the ( controversial but nevertheless established ) existence of uhecr spectra above gzk ( @xmath4 ev ) energies , but also in the extreme homogeneous and isotropic map of their arrival directions .",
    "the absence of any correlation or hint of nearby sources ( g.c , virgo , super - galactic maps ) is , in our opinion , a major growing puzzle .",
    "let us briefly summarize the uhecr state of art :    1 .",
    "the eventual appearance of a gzk cut - off as claimed by hires experiment @xcite is in partial disagreement to the earliest agasa data @xcite .",
    "we note that a even more dramatic discrepancy takes place _ all along _ the uhecr spectra , by a factor two or more , from eev energy band energy up to gzk edges , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , @xcite .",
    "this calibration problem maybe the source of the overall disagreement .",
    "the auger data seem to be consistent with hires more than agasa , also at lower energies .",
    "2 .   the absence of eev correlation map , as claimed by auger , with galactic center might signal the premature end of a timid but exciting eev neutron astronomy , suggested by agasa and sugar ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   the absence of clear tev correlation with uhecr , as noted in @xcite , disfavors a direct proton uhecr propagation at ten eev energy @xcite , as well as the very possible neutral nature of the final uhecr associated to some bl - lac source @xcite ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) . a gamma ray precursor or afterglow at uhecr arrival direction",
    "may disentangle the z - burst solution versus a primary proton candidate @xcite .",
    "the gorbunov , tinyakov , tkachev , and troitsky @xcite claim for an uhecr correlation with far bl - lacs has been somehow excluded ( as it was ) , but nevertheless it has been found out again , in a different set of records , by hires itself @xcite ; therefore bl - lac are still on - stage candidate smoking gun for uhecr .",
    "their imprint might be found in tev gamma traces @xcite .",
    "the bl - lac sources that might be the primary objects ( by their uhe jet emission toward us ) , are mostly located at distances quite above gzk volumes ( hundreds of mpc ) .",
    "therefore either one find a reasonable way to transport these uhecr from cosmic edges to us ( with negligible or null energy losses ) or one must advocate for extreme random magnetic fields , @xmath5gauss , in universe to diffuse their maps .",
    "the latter seems quite unrealistic . in a total different frame - work tens",
    "eev protons , long life and un - deflected in a nearly magnetic - free universe has been proposed recently @xcite ( but see also critical remarks in @xcite ) . among the exotic solutions for uhecr free arrival from cosmic edges , lorenz invariance violation has been more and more advocated ( but also dismissed ) and even uhecr mirror neutrons have been postulated @xcite .",
    "the z - burst model based on well established neutrino masses ( even at @xmath6 ev ) and on possible uhe neutrinos at zev energies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , might solve quite naturally the puzzle without new assumption on new physics .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to make more compelling a uhecr - z - burst cosmic connection is the very possible correlation between most distant bl lacs ( found gorbunov @xcite group as the ones shown in table 1 , or in @xcite ) and uhecrs arrivals directions .",
    "these uhecr to reach us with the observed energy and to overcome the electron pairs energy losses , must be born at extreme energies , well above the ones needed for z - burst models @xcite .",
    "therefore the z - burst uhe neutrinos are more realistic than other extreme nucleon primary sources .",
    "it should be reminded that the very recent data by hires and gorbunov group are finding correlation in a very narrow uhecr arrival angle , pointing for a neutral uhecr primary at ten eev .",
    "otherwise galactic field may slightly smear their directions .",
    "one must notice that among the z - boson decay secondaries , uhe @xmath7 rays ( by neutral pion at ten eev energy ) are required .",
    "their presence , nevertheless have been recently bounded by auger records @xcite .",
    "however it maybe be that just a @xmath8 of uhecr at ten eevs energies are enough to make the hires bl - lac connections with uhecr .",
    "this occur at the same resonance energies of primary neutrino at ten zev band and secondary nucleons at @xmath9 ev ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . to make these arguments short and readable",
    "let us summarize the fate of a final proton in a ten - eev scenario versus the z - burst model : in the first case in fig.[fig5 ] , the primary uhecr , for most far bl lac shown in table 1 , require extreme primary energy .",
    "on the other side we see in fig.[fig6 ] z - burst secondary nucleon energy ( after few tens mpc flight ) meets the needed values .",
    "the idea to use the relic neutrinos as a beam dump where to convert uhe cosmic @xmath10 and @xmath11 hitting onto relic @xmath11 and @xmath10 is multi - faces : it is already tuned , with present very possible light neutrino mass ( @xmath12 ev ) to uhe @xmath10 at @xmath13 ev and to the observed uhecr edges above @xmath9 ev , ( namely @xmath14 ev ) , fitting tens eev photons secondaries .",
    "the light neutrino halo may extend to tens mpc offering a wide nearly isotropic cloud to capture cosmic uhe zevs @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows the scenario of such a large halo where uhe zev @xmath10 shower to observable nucleons : @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the last neutral ones are few mpc long life while the charged ones ar confined in a gzk volume ( ten mpc ) . the second role in light neutrino mass is the possibility to be so much light to split the mass degeneracy into twin or triple values .",
    "consequently the z - burst may tune to different energies leading to different energy injection at uhecr spectra edges .",
    "present and future large array , like auger , may test this exciting uhe limits .      the different relic neutrino mass may be resonant in z - boson production at different uhe incoming neutrino .",
    "the highest energy couple with the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "this has been noted and explained @xcite and here summarized in fig.[fig7 ] and in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "the uhe incoming neutrino _ meets _ the lightest neutrino mass making a resonant z - boson at different energies ; the highest incoming @xmath10 energy scatters and resonates at lightest @xmath10 masses .",
    "the clustering of fermions are bounded by their @xmath10 masses ( pauli exclusion principle ) : the lightest relic @xmath10 reach a lower density contrast respect the heavier ones .",
    "therefore the density and the interaction probability may also be enhanced in multi z - burst peak appearances at the uhecr edges ( see fig.[fig7 ] and fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "the same uhe neutrinos at zev energy , predicted in z - burst model , might mix their primordial flavor , while travelling along stellar or galactic distances ; for present atmospheric @xmath10 mixing a complete oscillation take place at a distance @xmath18 : @xmath19 giving life to the most rare @xmath0 lepton components .",
    "these uhe @xmath17 ( of z - burst nature ) , while interacting on terrestrial crust maybe source of skimming neutrinos ( hortaus @xcite , @xcite , preferentially at lower eev energy band ) whose zev tau decay in flight is too long , @xmath20 km , to be contained in earth air atmosphere .",
    "it has been recently noted @xcite that wider atmosphere layers are found in larger planets .",
    "the largest ones near jupiter and saturn may reach a corresponding @xmath0 energy at @xmath21 ev . at zev",
    "energies the widest and nearest atmosphere horizons are found on our sun .",
    "however such zev @xmath22 solar grazing showers , while in general being discontinue , are making brief millisecond flashes .",
    "these showers may manifest themselves in wide areas ( on far earth detectors or satellites ) by their overlapping and nearly persistent bremsstrahlung secondary pairs which are blazing into x - ray flare .",
    "this occurs while an observer is crossing into the beam showers cone radiated all along the sun limb edges ; the solar skimming bremsstrahlung shower may mimic weakest solar flares or pulsed flashes within a narrow ( few seconds ) duration , due to the sharp density profile size of the sun ( @xmath23 ) where the phenomena occurs ; these showers may be correlated to known sources arrival directions @xcite .      to estimate the uhe neutrino @xmath17 behavior while skimming the solar atmosphere , making its uhe @xmath0 whose later flight and decay may blaze at solar edges we show ( see fig.[fig9 ] ) their interaction lengths in respect to the terrestrial cases .",
    "the tau showering at horizons has a long story @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the interaction length play a key role : the @xmath0 energy losses in solar atmosphere allows to reach distances as large as @xmath24 km , because of the much large solar radius ( than earth one , by a factor @xmath25 ) and its larger height growth ( @xmath26 times the terrestrial ones ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "the consequent place where best tau skimming occur has an energy a zev edges , as shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "z - burst is still an open solution to uhecr puzzling isotropy , bl lac connections and possible future showering in solar edges .",
    "z - burst may reflect itself , because of non - degenerated neutrino mass splitting , into a surprising _ anti - gzk _ bump modulation in zev uhecr spectra edges .",
    "the field is growing and need to be carefully followed in view of the auger near future response ."
