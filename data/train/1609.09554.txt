    "many real world complex systems display both cooperative and competitive phenomena with tendencies for both order and disorder in tension .",
    "where such systems involve connectivity between component entities and elementary limit cycles , a generalisation of the kuramoto model @xcite for synchronising oscillators to multi - networks @xcite provides a useful paradigm for modelling .",
    "add to this certain ` lags ' , otherwise known as _ frustrations _",
    "@xcite giving what is often called the kuramoto - sakaguchi model , and noise @xcite and the key elements for modelling such systems are in place .",
    "previously we studied such a model @xcite for its equilibria both analytically and numerically . in this paper",
    "we add gaussian noise to the system , a generalisation to finite arbitrary networks of approaches such as @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the system of equations describing the dynamics of kuramoto oscillators on a network @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the phase angle for node @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the intrinsic frequency of the aforementioned node , and @xmath4 is a global coupling constant . the adjacency matrix , @xmath5 , encodes the network topology of the system , where @xmath6 or @xmath7 if nodes @xmath2 and @xmath8 are connected or disconnected , respectively . for",
    "non - identical native frequencies , at strong coupling all phases eventually frequency synchronise and approach phase locking : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 .    in this work",
    "we focus on a two - network generalisation of eq.([originalkura ] ) , with double the defining equations , and additional coupling constants for internal and external network interactions .",
    "also we add frustration parameters to the cross - network interaction interactions take the form @xmath12 if @xmath2 and @xmath8 belong to different populations . with no frustration within a population and , possibly asymmetric , frustrations between populations",
    "there is competition between the two networks : members of the same population seek to phase synchronise while competing agents seek to frequency synchronise by a phase @xmath13 . as in @xcite , we refer to the populations as _ blue _ and _ red _ and individual phase oscillator at network nodes as agents .",
    "the asymmetry means that if blue agents seek to be @xmath13 ahead of red agents , the latter may seek a phase shift of @xmath14 with respect to blue , where @xmath15 .    in @xcite we employed approximations in a fixed point analysis to derive thresholds for sharp changes in the dynamics .",
    "two fixed points were considered , one at which one population achieves near - phase synchronisation but places the other population at the point of dislocation from their competitors where there are two clusters in frequency synchrony . the other gives the threshold for internal fragmentation where there are three clusters in frequency synchrony .",
    "we now test these same thresholds for robustness against increasing noise strength when noise is applied to nodes in different sub - structures in the network by comparing numerical solution of the full non - linear langevin equation with analytic solutions in the linearised system using the fokker - planck equation .",
    "an important tool is the laplacian matrix for the various networks , leading to its eigenvalues , both zero and non - zero - or ` normal ' - modes , and eigenvectors . as in @xcite for the ordinary kuramoto model , applying noise to these then triggers incoherence .",
    "we show that the approximations largely predict the behaviours in the numerical solution for the non - linear stochastic system .",
    "in particular , we show that noise applied separately to zero or normal modes leads to quite different dynamics elegantly understandable within the fokker - planck approach .",
    "we explore a surprising behaviour , where noise on a tightly coupled population , whose deterministic interaction with the other population triggers fragmentation of the latter , _ enhances _ synchronisation .",
    "thus noise is not always a ` nuisance ' , but may improve order , much like gentle rocking of the hand helps balancing a vertical rod .",
    "such phenomena has been observed elsewhere @xcite but to our knowledge this is the first example of this arising from noise in a multi - network kuramoto based system .",
    "our ` blue - vs - red ' formalism is a special case of that of @xcite though we additionally apply noise , and provide numerical illustrations of larger more complex systems .",
    "first we summarise the blue - vs - red model and the linearisation around the two cluster fixed point .",
    "we then set up the stochastic model and its linearisation .",
    "we present an illustrative case with blue a tree network and red a random graph used in @xcite .",
    "we then separately examine the impact of noise on zero modes and non - zero , or normal , modes , deriving analytical results from the fokker - planck approach near the two cluster fixed point , and then testing in turn with numerical simulation of the full non - linear system .",
    "this enables understanding of the basic range of dynamics of the model .",
    "we then set up the formalism for analysing fragmentation and numerically solve to show stochastic synchronicity . using the three cluster _ ansatz",
    "_ we show how this behaviour arises from a zero mode .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion and outline of future work .",
    "appendices provide more detail on definitions and lengthy derivations .",
    "we briefly summarise here the deterministic blue vs red model from @xcite but relegate further details relevant to this paper to appendix a. consider @xmath16 blue agents in a network given by adjacency matrix @xmath17 , and @xmath18 red agents in a network given by adjacency matrix @xmath19 .",
    "undirected networks are only considered here . each blue agent @xmath20 , has an associated phase @xmath21 giving the position in a limit cycle ; similarly @xmath22 is the position in the limit cycle of a red agent @xmath23 .",
    "the ` blue vs red model ' is given by the system of equations : @xmath24 the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the external links of blue to red agents ( size @xmath27 ) and red to blue agents ( size @xmath28 ) respectively .",
    "for the remainder of this work we assume that they are the transpose of each other , so that the network between blue and red is symmetric .",
    "the @xmath29 adjacency matrix for the corresponding external blue - red connections , labeled @xmath30 has the following block off - diagonal form , @xmath31 the quantities @xmath32 give the natural frequencies of the associated blue and red agents respectively , and are typically drawn from some probability distribution . finally , @xmath33 are coupling constants , respectively , for intra - blue , intra - red , blue to red and red to blue .",
    "asymmetry between blue and red potentially exists in the coupling constants and frustrations : @xmath34 need not equal @xmath35 and @xmath13 need not equal @xmath14 .    in general , the system in eq.([br - eq ] ) can only be solved numerically . to gain analytic insight in a region of greatest relevance - given",
    "that blue and red may deem internal phase synchronisation ideal - we explore a fixed point given by the _ ansatz _ : @xmath36 the variables @xmath37 are all time dependent , but @xmath38 are small fluctuations @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that through eq.([fixpoint1 ] ) we now have a system of @xmath41 defining equations , but @xmath42 variables , however @xmath43 and @xmath44 representing the centroids of the blue and red phases respectively are defined by @xmath45 which completes the specification of the system . consequently @xmath46 .",
    "one of our main quantities of interest is the difference between each network s global phases , given by : @xmath47 we refer to the phase locking within blue , @xmath48 , and red @xmath49 , as _ internal _ or _",
    "local locking _ , and the phase locking of blue externally with to red , @xmath50 , as _ external _ or _",
    "global phase locking_. however , if in this state @xmath51 then we may speak of external _ frequency _ locking . in this case , the distinguishability of the blue and red agents means we have two clusters visualising all oscillators as moving points on the unit circle , hence our name for the _",
    "ansatz_.    we now linearise the system using eqs.([fixpoint1],[fixpoint - alph ] ) , keeping only terms first order in a taylor expansion in @xmath52 and @xmath53 giving @xmath54 where @xmath55 the quantities @xmath56 and @xmath57 , labelled with superscripts @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent respectively the _ degree _ and corresponding _ laplacian _ matrices for the blue , red , blue - red and red - blue networks using the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "these have been defined explicitly in @xcite and in appendix a ; for brevity we do not repeat them here apart from pointing out that the laplacian @xmath60 , the difference of the degree and adjacency matrices @xcite , whose eigenvalues are important in the stability properties of many coupled dynamical systems @xcite .      for analytical purposes",
    "we assume that @xmath61 so that the equations for the fluctuations @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq.([linsys ] ) may be decoupled .",
    "this approximation does not completely hold even in regimes where linearisation might otherwise hold but we shall identify these points and where behaviours deviate from expectations based on this .",
    "we are thus able to employ the properties of graph laplacians to decouple the resulting system of defining equations .",
    "specifically the laplacians , @xmath62 and @xmath63 both contain a complete spanning set of orthonormal eigenvectors for the @xmath16 and @xmath18 dimensional subspaces , labeled by @xmath64 , ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 , ( @xmath67 ) , respectively .",
    "eigenvalues are denoted @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we distinguish between indices in node space @xmath70 , and those in eigen - mode space @xmath71 ( which has the same dimensionality ) by reserving labels @xmath72 for expressions involving graph nodes , and labels @xmath73 for expressions involving laplacian eigen - modes .",
    "importantly , the spectrum of eigenvalues is bounded by an eigenvalue zero that has degeneracy according to the number of components of the graph @xcite .",
    "we assume here that blue and red networks each consist of one component . up to normalisation , the corresponding zero eigenvectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 consists of all unit valued entries .",
    "thus , @xmath43 and @xmath44 as defined in eq.([bpdef ] ) are the zero - mode projections of the phases @xmath21 and @xmath76 .",
    "analogously , we denote by @xmath77 and @xmath78 the projections of @xmath52 and @xmath79 on the blue and red non - zero eigenvectors .",
    "we give explicit expressions in appendix a. the eigenvectors corresponding to low - lying laplacian eigenvalues are known generally to expose underlying structures in a network @xcite .    applying the approximation eq.([interactionsaregone ] ) and the eigenvector projections in eq.([linsys ] ) , and taking advantage of the orthonormality of the eigenvectors , yields the system , @xmath80 where , @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath83 the projections onto the @xmath84th eigenvector , and @xmath85 the average over @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 the projections onto the @xmath88th eigenvector for red ) .",
    "the advantage of the structure of the system in eq.([integrablesystem ] ) is that it allows now @xmath89 to be solved first , and then used in the forcing terms of the normal mode equations which are otherwise linear and solvable in their own right .",
    "taking the difference of @xmath90 and @xmath91 gives the dynamics of @xmath89 , @xmath92 for @xmath93 and , @xmath94 the substitution , @xmath95 , leads to the solution @xmath96 where @xmath97 , encodes the initial conditions for @xmath89 , and @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 the solutions to the normal modes are given in appendix a. ultimately their dynamics depends on the behaviour of @xmath100 which in turn is governed by the potential @xmath101 in eq.([alphaeq ] ) .",
    "this is commonly referred to as a _ tilted periodic _",
    "@xcite or _ tilted smoluchowski - feynman ratchet _",
    "@xcite potential .",
    "importantly , we have periodicity , @xmath102 , and the tilt refers to the constant forcing term in @xmath103 given by the difference of frequency averages @xmath104 .",
    "the sign of @xmath98 is critical .",
    "if @xmath105 the solution asymptotes to the value @xmath106 mod @xmath107 . if @xmath108 then the @xmath109 in eq.([alphasol ] ) becomes a tangent , and the solution is oscillatory with period @xmath110 .",
    "correspondingly , for @xmath105 , @xmath101 is a series of local maxima ( unstable fixed points at @xmath111 ) and local minima ( stable fixed points at @xmath112 ) , on a landscape which has an overall slope according to the sign of @xmath104 . for @xmath113",
    "the hills and valleys of the potential become points of inflection , and hence unstable fixed points . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the potential loses all of its fixed points , even the unstable ones .",
    "for each graph node of the blue and red networks , we apply additive noise @xmath115 ( effectively a time - dependence for the frequencies ) to the full blue - red system , eqs.([br - eq ] ) .",
    "the noise may be decomposed in terms of eigenvectors of the blue / red laplacians @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are uncorrelated gaussian white noise ( gwn ) terms with @xmath119 and variance @xmath120 , namely @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we also refer to @xmath123 as the noise strength .",
    "then analogously to sec.[sec : det - bvsr ] , we obtain the following langevin system @xmath124 where the variables and parameters are as used in eq ..    as advertised , we seek to test the consequences of noise applied separately , and in combination , to zero and normal modes .",
    "this is achieved by selecting either zero or one for the @xmath125 parameters .",
    "we consider three cases :    * @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 has noise applied to normal modes ; * @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath128 has noise applied to zero modes ; and * @xmath127 , @xmath131 has all noise applied to all modes .",
    "we denote by @xmath132 the probability that a random variable @xmath133 lies in the range @xmath134 in the stochastic system of eq .. the initial state @xmath135 at time @xmath136 is @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 represent the vectors , in the laplacian basis , of components @xmath77 and @xmath140 , and @xmath89 represents the difference between the zero modes . from the langevin equations",
    "eq.([eqn : integrablesystem - w - noise ] ) using the it interpretation one can immediately construct the fokker - planck equation for the evolution of the _ joint _ probability density @xcite @xmath141 .",
    "nevertheless , apart from being quite unwieldy , the joint distribution is not helpful for our requirements . instead , when we come to consider probability density functions , we shall rely on the _ marginal _ and _ conditional _ densities of the zero , and normal modes respectively ( see chap . 1 of @xcite and chap . 2 of @xcite ) . to enable this we rely on the fact that although @xmath89 appears as a common term in the normal mode langevin equations , the zero mode langevin equation for @xmath89 is independent of the modes @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "intuitive as the fokker - planck equation is , it is difficult to determine the stability of the non - linear dynamical system @xcite . because of the linearisation for eq.([eqn : integrablesystem - w - noise ] ) , we may not trust behaviour for arbitrarily large @xmath142 and @xmath89 and we lack clear bounds for the basin of attraction for the phase synchronised fixed point .",
    "thus solutions @xmath143 exhibiting significant tails in these regimes imply instability only insofar as there is a non - negligible probability that the non - linear terms will be non - vanishing . for the deterministic kuramoto model @xcite this",
    "requires that @xmath144 must be small to be close to the linearised regime ; for the stochastic kuramoto system with additive gaussian noise the requirement is for small variance @xmath145 of the fokker - planck density .      to illustrate our otherwise general solutions and compare to numerical simulation we consider an example of blue agents forming a hierarchy and red agents on a random network . as in @xcite ,",
    "for @xmath86 we consider a tree graph , namely a complete 4-ary tree , thus setting @xmath146 .",
    "we use a random erds - rnyi network also of @xmath146 with link of probability @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "the two networks , and further details of their interconnection , are shown in appendix c in fig.[fig : bvsr - networks ] .",
    "the specific frequencies of each agent were drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and one , @xmath149 $ ] and are also plotted in appendix c. in the examples used here , the average frequencies turn out to be @xmath150 , giving a slightly negative @xmath151 . thus if cross - couplings were set to zero the red population would lap blue over time .",
    "this is reflected in a negative slope for the tilted ratchet potential @xmath101 .",
    "finally , as in @xcite we choose the couplings @xmath152 for the networks in fig.[fig : bvsr - networks ] , these will give high internal phase synchronisation - the measure for which is given momentarily - but allow for some changes in dynamics as the frustrations @xmath13 and @xmath14 are varied . in @xcite , we also set @xmath153 but varied @xmath13 .",
    "for the deterministic system , this means a change in the sign of @xmath98 from positive to negative at a point that , to four significant figures , is @xmath154 .",
    "thus in the vicinity of this point , in the absence of noise , for @xmath13 less than this value the system stabilises to blue a fixed angle ahead of red , and for @xmath155 blue and red remain internally phase synchronised but lapping each other with a period that decreases as @xmath13 gets larger . eventually the periodicity with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath14 implicit in eq.([eq : special - k ] ) will manifest itself .",
    "when we explore below numerical examples on either side of @xmath156 , at typical points @xmath157 and @xmath158 , we ask : how does noise change the deterministic behaviours ?",
    "to measure the degree of synchronisation within a given population we use local forms of kuramoto s order parameter @xcite @xmath159 the third , @xmath160 , examines the degree of synchronisation within the red population for two sub - clusters , where @xmath161 has red agents interacting with a blue agent .",
    "we emphasise that in many of our examples in the following the total system order parameter @xmath162 will be far from the value one .",
    "we consider first the case @xmath163 .",
    "consequently , @xmath89 becomes deterministic with solution eq .",
    ", tending to a fixed value as @xmath164 or periodic , according to the sign of @xmath98 in eq .. as @xmath89 is no longer a random variable all the normal mode langevin equations in eq.([eqn : integrablesystem - w - noise ] ) are independent .",
    "thus the corresponding fokker - planck equation can be decomposed into a product of @xmath165 densities , @xmath166 leading to a decoupling into separate fokker - planck equations for each mode @xmath167 we obtain a similar set of fokker - planck equations for the non - zero modes @xmath78 .",
    "these equations are the direct analogue of the system solved in section 3.2.1 of @xcite for the pure kuramoto model .    using a simple variable transformation as given in sec.(1.8.3.6 ) of @xcite",
    "we obtain the following time dependent solution for eq ..",
    "@xmath168 where @xmath169 the statistical properties of mean , mode and variance are straightforwardly extracted from this result , where the mean is equivalent to the solution to the deterministic equation ( given in appendix a ) .",
    "we note from sec.[sec : det - bvsr ] that if @xmath170 then this solution decays to a time periodic solution and furthermore we can see that the variance approaches @xmath171 for large time .",
    "if however we have that @xmath172 , then as noted in sec.[sec : det - bvsr ] , @xmath89 tends to a stable fixed point and the solution approaches a steady - state form : @xmath173 ^ 2\\right).\\ ] ]    basically , we have a gaussian distribution whose mean is contingent on the deterministic behaviour of @xmath89 : decaying to a constant over time for @xmath174 , or decaying to an oscillation for @xmath175 .",
    "we may anticipate several regimes of behaviour here . for large couplings @xmath176 and/or @xmath177 , or large laplacian modes , where ` large ' means on the scale of the noise variance @xmath123",
    ", we obtain densities close to the deterministic solution with small variance - and thus a narrow gaussian smearing around the behaviour either at fixed @xmath89 for @xmath174 , or periodic @xmath89 for @xmath175 . however , once the couplings become too small or alternatively we examine low - lying laplacian modes while @xmath174 , the variance becomes large consistent with a long tail in the density .",
    "this is one mechanism by which modes may lie outside the basin of attraction with non - zero probability .",
    "the other mechanism is simply that the centre of the distribution lies away from the origin so that the tails again fall outside the basin .",
    "the consequences of this are not described in the approximation : non - linearities may switch on and the system may appear to fragment - with clusters jumping around the unit circle in relation to the main system of frequency locked blue and red agents .",
    "however , these same non - linearities that led to the initial appearance of synchronisation recur and the system may resynchronise . the solution itself does not describe this process because of its limitation to the linearised regime . note that such jumps would appear in @xmath89 but would not have any particular periodicity if @xmath174 because the escape from the basin of attraction is purely probabilistic .",
    "contrastingly , in the regime of @xmath175 only periodic jumps in @xmath89 would be expected . however , here because of the oscillation in the mean of the density in eq.([eq : fp - norm - mode - sol ] ) there may be slight deviations as , correspondingly , the tail of the distribution reaches larger values of @xmath77 or @xmath140 .",
    "thus non - periodic fragmentations may appear in individual laplacian modes on top of the basic oscillation with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "we now solve the full system eq.([br - eq ] ) with noise added and @xmath163 and @xmath178 , for all @xmath179 and @xmath180 . unless otherwise stated we set @xmath181 but comment on behaviours at lower values .",
    "numerical solution is performed in mathematica implementing the noise eq . using the `` itoprocess '' and `` randomfunction '' capabilities , taking 50 paths of the simulation , step sizes of 0.025 over the time interval 0 to 1000 .",
    "these simulations were run for varying values of the frustration parameter @xmath13 and the variance @xmath123 while keeping initial conditions fixed .",
    "the results were then aggregated by taking the mean , median and upper and lower quartiles of @xmath182 and @xmath89 .",
    "the first five paths of each simulation were plotted against the relevant deterministic solutions , which were produced via use of the `` ndsolve '' function using the `` stiffness switching '' method in mathematica .    in fig.[fig",
    ": normal - frac05-stddev-1 ] , we show the behaviour as a function of time of @xmath182 , @xmath89 and individual modes @xmath183 and @xmath184 going up the laplacian spectrum , with @xmath157 , namely @xmath174 .",
    "the order parameters @xmath182 show reasonably high internal synchronisation , though @xmath185 shows stronger fluctuations than @xmath186 .",
    "the plot for @xmath89 shows constant behaviour , but with discrete jumps .",
    "however , a plot of the median value of @xmath89 ( middle , right plot ) shows no indication of periodicity .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath187 explains the picture : some instances shows jumps , consistent with this lowest mode leaving the basin of attraction but then returning .",
    "the blue network mode , @xmath188 , shows no such behaviour - and higher modes correspondingly are absent of such behaviour .",
    "all this is consistent with eq.([eq : fp - norm - mode - sol ] ) in the regime with @xmath174 .",
    "if the noise strength @xmath123 were reduced the jumps in @xmath89 and the red laplacian modes would disappear and the fluctuations in @xmath185 would reduce ; for brevity we omit such plots here .",
    "the fact that the red modes show fragmentation at stronger noise is noteworthy . for these cases , the variables controlling the variance of the gaussian in eq.([eq : fp - norm - mode - sol ] )",
    "is the product of the internal coupling and laplacian eigenvalue . for the lowest mode @xmath189 ,",
    "numerically these turn out to be nearly the same , @xmath190 ( by deliberate choice of @xmath176 , to balance the smaller lowest eigenvalues for the tree network compared to the random - see fig.[spectra ] ) .",
    "the significant difference between the blue and red densities here lies in the numerical values of the quantities @xmath83 and @xmath191 appearing in @xmath192 in eq.([eq : fp - norm - mode - sol ] ) and in turn in the drift terms @xmath193 and @xmath194 in eqs.([drifts ] ) .",
    "these quantities will recur throughout our analysis .",
    "for the @xmath189 modes these are of order of magnitude @xmath195 for blue and @xmath196 for red .",
    "the impact of these values here is in locating the centre of the densities : for blue close to the origin , for red further away .",
    "thus , though both modes densities exhibit similar diffusivity , that for red is further from the origin so that the tail of the density may fall outside the basin of attraction - triggering the onset of nonlinearities and fragmentation as described .    now we set @xmath158 where , deterministically , @xmath197 by which we mean marginally below the value required for a steady state solution . in fig.[fig : normal - frac095-stddev-1 ] we show the analogue of fig.[fig : normal - frac05-stddev-1 ] .",
    "we observe a distinct periodicity for both order parameters @xmath182 and @xmath89 , though the periodicity in the order parameters is best detected in the mean and median . at weaker noise values the fluctuations in the order parameters",
    "is naturally reduced ( again , not shown for brevity ) .",
    "on the other hand , the behaviour of @xmath89 is rather smooth and consistent even for individual paths .",
    "the period of the oscillation is shorter than that for the deterministic case - shown as a dashed line in fig.[fig : normal - frac095-stddev-1 ] ( b ) - though for weak noise the periodicity is consistent with that of the deterministic case .",
    "nonetheless , from order parameters and @xmath89 we may conclude that periodically the red cluster undergoes a rapid rotation with respect to blue .",
    "this leads to subtle effects in the order parameters : blue appears to improve in synchronisation , @xmath198 , as a consequence of the red agents interacting with them pass by leading to a ` bunching up ' of phases .",
    "subsequently the red population rotates away so that those red agents interacting with blue momentarily  splays , caught between their partners and blue , hence the slight drop in red s degree of synchronisation in the plot of @xmath199 ( top , left ) .",
    "the individual laplacian modes , particularly @xmath187 show that some jumping - fragmentation - is occuring , but also the fluctuations are understandably stronger .",
    "indeed , decreasing @xmath123 removes the fragmentation effects allowing the cycling of red to be visible in @xmath187 .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with what we might expect from our analytical considerations : the underlying deterministic periodicity , overlaid now with occasional fragmentation because the tail of the associated fokker - planck density cyclically visits regions of large values for @xmath200 thus allowing for _ periodic _ fragmentation of the system .",
    "the differences between individual paths for @xmath89 confirm a degree of stochasticity so that deterministic dynamics based on the linearisation here can not wholly explain the behaviour .",
    "the most glaring surprise is the faster period of the system but nevertheless , for some stochasticity , remarkably robust .",
    "because the order parameters reach relatively low values , for example @xmath201 , the system regularly reaches regions where a two - cluster ( blue and red ) linearisation no longer holds .",
    "therefore we should not look in eq.([eq : fp - norm - mode - sol ] ) for an account of the dynamics after the point of fragmentation because our approximation @xmath202 breaks down .",
    "this leads to additional interactions in the equation for @xmath89 that modify its _",
    "deterministic _ behaviour - triggering an extra cycle compared to the linearised prediction .",
    "however , these same nonlinearities lead the system to resynchronise so that the approximation takes hold again , leading to another deterministic cycle in @xmath89 according to the present two - cluster simplification .",
    "thus we may say that the linearisation breaks down half the time .",
    "in this case the noise is projected solely on the zero modes , thus @xmath203 and @xmath204 , for all @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "thus the first two normal mode langevin equations in eq .",
    "become deterministic and @xmath205 and @xmath78 only experience stochastic effects through the nonlinear langevin equation for @xmath89 . in this case",
    "we first construct the marginal density of @xmath89 , and use this to give the corresponding marginal densities of the non - zero normal modes .",
    "the marginal density for @xmath89 , @xmath206 , is the solution to the following fokker - planck equation , @xmath207 where @xmath101 is given in eq.([alphaeq ] ) .",

    "left case of fig.[fig : xsx3 ] , stronger noise allows the @xmath89 state to stochastically escape the wells in the ratchet potential , so that @xmath240 and , correspondingly normal modes , especially the lowest ones ( with small laplacian eigenvalue ) , do not localise to a point but to a region . in the right column plots of fig.[fig : xsx3 ] the tilted ratchet potential has no wells , @xmath89 runs down the tilt , therefore none of the normal modes may localise to the fixed point . for weak noise and a high laplacian mode - the @xmath261 line in the upper right hand plot of fig.[fig : xsx3 ] -",

    "we observe , unsurprisingly , in the two top plots that , firstly as cross - coupling increases there is little impact on the order within @xmath86 and @xmath161 , while , secondly , increasing noise on blue decreases the overall degree of synchronisation of both blue ( most dramatically ) and @xmath161 ( less severely ) .",

    "this is the stochastic synchronisation we anticipated .",
    "physically , the noise effectively loosens the blue population , working against its tight internal coupling .",
    "this loosening of blue has a second order effect on red , so that the previously incompatible competition and internal red goals become more compatible with increasing noise on blue .",

    "with increasing noise this angle decreases confirming the improvement of synchronisation within the red population : up to a certain @xmath34 the angle is fixed in time , so there is frequency synchronisation within red ( as well as higher synchronisation within @xmath273 while @xmath161 is more splayed , as seen in fig.[fig:3-cluster - orders ] ) .",

    "curves such as these thus provide a means of determing the balance between the conflicting requirements of internal synchronisation , synchronisation of the competitor population and fulfillment of the strategy of being collectively ahead or behind .      though the physical intuition behind the stochastic synchronisation is clear , can the analytical formalism based on linearisation account quantitatively for this behaviour ? for the linearised system in the three cluster _ ansatz _",

    "significantly , the densities for large @xmath34 and @xmath123 in fig.[fig : alphar1r2densities ] show a flattening and loss of double - boundedness from @xmath351 . thus , as noise strengthens there is an increase in likelihood of @xmath352 taking values outside the basin of attraction triggering dynamic behaviour .",

    "finally , in fig.[fig : alphabr1expected ] we plot @xmath353 where @xmath354 and @xmath355 are given by the allowable regions of @xmath343 in @xmath356 and @xmath357 is given by eq.([marginalr1r2 ] ) .    ) for the blue tree network and red random network , with varying noise and inter - network coupling . as usual , the inter - network coupling varies from @xmath339 to @xmath342 in steps of @xmath341 and the standard deviation varies from @xmath235 to @xmath342 in steps of @xmath341 . ]    we compare the linearisation based fig.[fig : alphabr1expected ] with the numerical simulation in fig.[subfig:3cluster - abr ] .",
    "we see that fig.[fig : alphabr1expected ] emulates fig.[subfig:3cluster - abr ] specifically in the decrease of the expected value of the angle with increasing noise values ( red lines are below green lines ) .",
    "the results also correctly reproduce the slight increase in @xmath308 with @xmath358 followed by decrease for higher @xmath123 . however",
    ", the analytical approach does not detect a sharp threshold for the onset of dynamics , so that curves in fig.[fig : alphabr1expected ] are given for the entire range of @xmath34 in contradistinction to fig.[subfig:3cluster - abr ] .",
    "additionally , fig.[fig : alphabr1expected ] does not pick up the interesting crossing of the large noise ( @xmath359 ) lines for the @xmath34 values from 2 to 3 .",
    "@xmath317 is straightforwardly computed in the linearised approximation after observing that its magnitude may be written as a sum over cosine of phase differences latexmath:[\\ ] ] and equivalent expressions for @xmath410 . as in sec.[sec:5 ] , the conditional probabilities are already @xmath107-periodic in @xmath89 , thus we do not need to perform the reduction - operation in eq.([eq : reduced - probabilities ] ) in the @xmath89 argument .",
    "therefore , applying the marginal probability for @xmath89 , we can obtain the marginal probability for @xmath77 by way of @xmath411 for which we have no explicit expression . nevertheless , we see from this that the highly non - gaussian properties of @xmath412 will now be modulated by the gaussian @xmath413 so that we anticipate a straightforward smearing of the distinct ratchet potential behaviours for @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "thus for @xmath174 we anticipate significantly noisier @xmath89 around a constant value as well as noisy normal modes @xmath77 and @xmath140 and order parameters , also around constant values . as noise strength @xmath123 increases",
    ", these fluctuations will be larger with no sign of periodicity but evidence of fracturing as the tail of these densities extend beyond the basin of attraction permitting non - linearities to temporarily kick in .",
    "we plot the densities for the normal modes in fig.[fig : marginalnormalfigbluered1 ] and see precisely the gaussian shape of these . in particular , we observe that the distributions for red modes are much more spread out than those of blue for stronger noise , with increased localisation for higher laplacian eigenmodes .",
    "the value of @xmath416 for the lowest mode in the equivalent of gaussian eq.([normalmodejoint ] ) for red connot explain this .",
    "in fact it is a consequence of the combination of the gaussian with @xmath412 where the projections @xmath83 and @xmath191 appear .",
    "we recall from the main body that , due to the partitionability of blue ( reflected in the fiedler eigenvector structure ) , the former is significantly smaller than the latter . here , through the integration in eq.([marginalnormalall ] ) , the small value effectively leads to a narrower gaussian for the blue modes - a smoothed version of the sharp bound in eq.[eq : modes - bounds ] for the noisy zero mode case .",
    "this means that , at the parameter values used in our illustrative examples in this paper , the fracturing of red should be evident first as @xmath123 is increased .    for @xmath175 we should find periodic @xmath89 with variation in the period ( as for the noisy zero mode case ) but now with distinctly noisy fluctuations on the normal modes and order parameters - with nevetheless a strong signal of periodicity . with stronger noise @xmath89",
    "should simply drift according to the sign of the tilted ratchet potential .",
    "normal modes and order parameters will be simply noisy . by similar arguments using the comparative values of @xmath83 and @xmath191",
    "we should observe more signs of fracturing in red than blue .",
    "having dissected so many cases we may be brief in the results here .",
    "fig.[fig : all - frac05-stddev-1 ] gives the usual sequence of plots from numerical simulations for @xmath157 , @xmath259 .",
    "we see precisely what analytical results predicted : noisy fluctuations on everything - order parameters , @xmath89 and normal modes , with @xmath89 showing no drift , consistent with @xmath174 here . moreover , we observe the predicted fragmentation in the lowest red mode @xmath266 .",
    "fig.[fig : all - frac095-stddev-005 ] and [ fig : all - frac095-stddev-1 ] show the results for @xmath158 where the time - periodicity of @xmath89 is evident for low @xmath123 going to general negative drift ( and a hint of periodicity in the median over paths ) for higher @xmath123 .",
    "again , this is consistent with @xmath175 .",
    "however , the key observation across all of these results is that the key differences between behaviours arises from the noise on zero modes - according to the sign of @xmath98 in the deterministic behaviour - overlaid with gaussian noise on normal modes .",
    "both of these effects fold into the behaviour of the order parameters .",
    "in the scenario where the dynamics of the red population show fragmentation into two sub - populations we define three centroids : @xmath417 the projection of cross - laplacians on fluctuations - terms that are deemed small in our approximations - now take the form : @xmath418 and @xmath419 for @xmath420 respectively .    as with the two cluster regime , in order to gain analytical insights into the linearised 3 cluster system we need to decide which of the laplacians we wish to diagonalise , and assume the remainder are negligible . as with the two cluster regime , we chose to diagonalise the intra - laplacians @xmath62 , @xmath421 and @xmath422 , and assumed that the interaction laplacians in @xmath423 offer a negligible contribution to the overall dynamics .",
    "the obvious pitfall of this assumption is that we lose all but the coarsest of information of the inter - network structure , namely the total number of connections per node @xmath424 and @xmath425 .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , if the interaction networks are not too complicated , this assumption does quite well in detecting system fixed points and the onset of dynamical behaviour .",
    "thus for analytical considerations we made the approximation @xmath426    using the laplacians in the three clusters for @xmath86 , @xmath161 and @xmath273 , the corresponding eigenvalue - eigenvectors are @xmath427 as usual , each set of laplacian eigenvalues has at least one zero eigenvalue , with the remaining being real , positive semi - definite @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the non - zero eigenvectors , we again expanded the fluctuations @xmath52 and @xmath428 in the following normal - modes : @xmath429",
