    "it has been recently shown @xcite that sodium vanadium oxide is the second example of the inorganic spin - peierls compound following @xmath6 @xcite . similarly to @xmath6 the strong decrease of the susceptibility @xmath7 in @xmath8",
    "is found below @xmath9 as a consequence of the opening of a spin - gap .",
    "the spin - peierls transition is one of the most interesting phenomena observed in low - dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "it occurs in crystals containing linear chains of half - integer spin coupled by antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the spin - peierls transition is analogue of the peierls transition in metal and results in dimerisation of the lattice induced by magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the lattice dimerisation and the existence of the spin - gap are also confirmed by x - ray , inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , nmr @xcite and esr @xcite measurements . using these techniques @xcite ,",
    "the spin gap was estimated to be in the range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the previously published infrared @xcite and raman @xcite spectra show the appearance of new modes below the transition temperature , but nothing was said about their origin .",
    "based on an early measurement of the @xmath0 crystal structure @xcite , it has been shown that this oxide , grown in single crystalline form under ambient conditions , has an orthorhombic unit cell with parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the space group @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "such a crystalline structure assumes two kinds of vanadium chains along the b - axis .",
    "one is magnetic @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and the other one is a nonmagnetic @xmath20 ( @xmath21 chains ) .",
    "these chains are aligned parallel to each other by sharing an edge of adjacent @xmath22 pyramids , thus forming layers in @xmath23 plane .",
    "@xmath24 atoms are situated between layers as intercalates .",
    "this magnetic structure is expected to be truly one - dimensional since the chains caring the spin are separated from each other by nonmagnetic chains along @xmath25-axis . the problem with this structure is missing physical argument for such a strong charge modulation .",
    "the most recent structural analysis @xcite shows that all vanadium atoms are equivalent and in mixed valent state .",
    "such a crystal structure is also predicted from polarized raman scattering measurements @xcite . even without charge modulation , due to strong electron correlations , it is possible to have formation of antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that an induced zigzag type of charge ordering along the ladders of v - ions is formed @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we consider only 1-d antiferromagnetic heisenberg model as an explanation for the magnetic behaviour of this compound .",
    "this is based on the magnetic susceptibility measurements of @xmath0 powder @xcite which shows a broad maximum at @xmath26 , followed by rapid decrease below @xmath27 .",
    "such a susceptibility behaviour can be well described as linear heisenberg antiferromagnet in the high temperature phase and by bulaevskii theory @xcite in dimerized phase , indicating that there is no frustration in this material .    in this work we present low temperature raman spectra of @xmath0 single crystal .",
    "the assignation of the observed modes is done on the basis of monte carlo calculation of excited states of heisenberg dimerized hamiltonian , without frustration .",
    "we found a good agreement between measured and calculated magnetic excitations for @xmath1 and @xmath28 .",
    "the singlet - triplet and singlet - singlet excitations as well as two - magnon mode are observed to be at @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the single crystals of @xmath8 with a size of approximately @xmath29 are obtained as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectral lines of an argon - ion laser are used as an excitation source .",
    "the light beam was focused on the sample surface using cylindrical lens with an average power of @xmath30 .",
    "the scattered light was collected with an objective , aperture 1:1.4 .",
    "the monohromator used was a jobin ivon model u1000 , equipped with a pelletier - effect - cooled rca 31034 photomultiplier with a conventional photon counting system .",
    "the temperature was controlled with closed - cycle helium cryostat ( leybold ) .",
    "numerical calculation were carried out on a 4-processor origin 2000 computer , courtesy of institute of physics computer facilities ( ipcf ) .",
    "the polarized raman spectra measured with @xmath31 laser line at temperature of @xmath32 are presented in .",
    "the new modes found at temperatures below transition temperature @xmath33 are denoted in the graph .",
    "the lowest excitation is observed at @xmath34 , with the largest intensity in @xmath23 polarized spectra .",
    "this mode is observed in @xmath35 polarization as well .",
    "the continuum of magnetic excitations starts at @xmath36 which is exactly two times @xmath34 energy and is observed only in @xmath23 configuration .",
    "the @xmath37 mode is found to be largest in @xmath35 spectrum .",
    "the other modes in the spectra are high temperature phonons assigned on the basis of valence shell model calculation @xcite .",
    "the broad structure present in @xmath38 spectra is assigned as electronic continuum which appears due to @xmath39 electronic transitions of @xmath18 ions @xcite .    to further analyse the origin of new modes we measured the raman spectra at different temperatures from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , .",
    "we found that @xmath34 mode exhibits the shift towards lower energy of @xmath42 by increasing temperature . besides the @xmath36 mode that shows similar shift , we observed additional structure at @xmath43 in the @xmath44 spectrum , denoted with an arrow . to resolve these two structures we performed higher resolution measurements ( resolution@xmath45 ) , see inset . by increasing the temperature",
    "this part of the spectrum rapidly looses intensity and the difference between these two modes is no longer observable .",
    "moreover , the existence of the continuum is confirmed by observing the fano - type asymmetry of the @xmath46 phonon with energy overlapping with that of the continuum .",
    "the asymmetry of this mode is becoming less pronounced by increasing temperature and finally becoming complete lorenzian in the @xmath47 spectrum .",
    "other modes in the spectra do not show frequency shift and we assigne them as phonons becoming active due to doubling of the unit cell .",
    "here we present the results of the numerical calculation based on green s function monte carlo technique ( gfmc ) @xcite .",
    "we assumed that @xmath0 can be modelled as 1-d heisenberg antiferomagnet with modulated nn coupling and no frustration .",
    "the relevance of this model comes from susceptibility measurements @xcite were it was shown that low temperature behaviour can be well described with the hamiltonian :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 are spin-1/2 operators .",
    "further , we assumed the periodic boundary conditions so that only rings with even numbers of spins were studied .",
    "we have calculated energies of the ground , the first excited triplet ( @xmath50 ) and quintuplet ( @xmath51 ) states for rings with @xmath52 spins .",
    "all these energies are calculated exactly with no approximation .",
    "the resulting triplet and quintuplet gaps , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are shown in for @xmath55 . the extrapolation to @xmath56 is done using a @xmath57 function .",
    "similar simpler functions were used in @xcite to extrapolate gaps obtained by lanczos diagonalization for systems up to @xmath58 . here , we have chosen more complicated ansatz to fit points for smaller @xmath59 also .",
    "the estimated error for the extrapolated values of triplet and quintuplet gaps are less then 1% .",
    "the size of symbols in figures do not represent this error .",
    "further details of extrapolation procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated results for all @xmath60 considered are given in .",
    "it is found that the singlet - triplet gap can be excellently fitted by the simple formula @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "this was also found in the recent study @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath63 this formula coincides with leading three orders of the perturbation theory , @xcite .",
    "the @xmath64 region was of no concern to us , and we do not know were the crossover to the known @xcite critical behaviour @xmath65 occurs .",
    "the singlet - quintuplet gap can not be fitted in such a simple fashion .",
    "we have found that it lies above the double singlet - triplet gap value , at the energy @xmath66 .",
    "this is consistent with the rpa study @xcite were this mode was identified as an anti - bound two - magnon state .",
    "the anti - boundedness @xmath67 decreases towards zero by increasing @xmath60 to 1 .",
    "according to the estimated error of our calculation the existence of a quintuplet state at energy differenet then 2@xmath53 is established for @xmath68 , see inset .",
    "to begin discussion , first we compare our gfmc calculation with other numerical results .",
    "the ground state energy is in excellent agreement with bethe ansatz solution @xcite in the limit @xmath69 and with the results for isolated dimmers when @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "moreover , our values for the triplet gap coincide precisely with the exact diagonalization results @xcite .",
    "the most important point , which is one of our main numerical results , is exact calculation for the lowest lying quintuplet state , @xmath51 .",
    "as allready mentioned above , this mode at energy @xmath66 was identified as an anti - bound two - magnon state @xcite . according to that study one",
    "should also expect singlet , two - magnon bound state , at the energy @xmath70 .",
    "such an excited singlet state can not be calculated exactly using gfmc but it can be estimated using the above formula .    the low temperature susceptibility measurements @xcite can be well described with bulaevskii theory , indicating the spin - peierls transition at 34 k. the fit gave value of the exchange integral @xmath71 and dimerization @xmath60 to be @xmath72 and @xmath1 . using slightly different parameters @xmath73 and @xmath1 we calculated singlet - triplet and singlet - quintuplet transition energies to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these values are obtained by a linear interpolation between calculated values for @xmath76 and @xmath55 .",
    "the value for singlet - singlet transition @xmath77 is obtained using above estimate .",
    "this value is in good agreement with exact diagonalization study which gives singlet to triplet gap ratio of @xmath78 @xcite . in the raman",
    "spectra the @xmath34 feature coincides with our numerical result for the triplet gap and it is possible that this mode comes from one - magnon scattering process .",
    "this value is in agreement with other measurements of the spin - gap .",
    "moreover , this mode shifts towards lower energies by increasing temperature and by decreasing sodium concentration @xcite .",
    "it was proved that sodium deficiency strongly suppresses the sp transition @xcite , which is an additional proof for the magnetic origin of this mode .",
    "still , behaviour of this mode in magnetic field remains to be studied .",
    "some preliminary results show no change of this mode in the magnetic fields up to @xmath79 @xcite .    the two - magnon mode is found to be at @xmath36 which is exactly twice the gap energy .",
    "it appears as a well - defined peak due to the one - dimensionality of the magnetic interaction .",
    "then the structure at @xmath43 can be described as singlet - singlet excitation with boundness @xmath80 , which is in agreement with our calculation .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with that of @xmath6 which is the first inorganic material exhibiting the spin - peierls transition .",
    "the magnetic mode at @xmath81 observed in @xmath6 @xcite is described as excitation from the ground state to singlet state with singlet to triplet gap ratio of @xmath82 .",
    "such a ratio is a consequence of frustration , which is quite large in this material . from our raman spectra we found that in @xmath0 this ratio is around @xmath83 , which is consistent with assumption that frustration is negligible in this material .",
    "moreover , the broad magnon band , centred at about twice the maximum magnon energy is not observed in our raman spectra which again proves existence of no frustration in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of magnetic scattering in @xmath23 polarized configuration can not be explained using exchange scattering mechanism of fleury and loudon @xcite , since this theory predicts the magnetic scattering in configuration parallel to the chains , ie . in @xmath35 direction .",
    "our previous study of raman spectra @xcite , using different laser line energies shows existence of resonance effects which may influence selection rules for magnetic scattering .",
    "it is also shown that @xmath34 feature , in the spectra measured with @xmath84 laser line consists of two modes separated by @xmath85 .",
    "still , the mechanism for the apearance of the second mode is not yet established .",
    "it was proposed that this mode , as well as , the @xmath37 comes from crystal field excitations of @xmath18 ions .",
    "finally , we conclude that magnetic excitations in the raman spectra of @xmath0 can be well described using gfmc calculation of excited states of dimerized 1-d heisenberg antiferomagnet with @xmath73 , @xmath1 and no frustration .",
