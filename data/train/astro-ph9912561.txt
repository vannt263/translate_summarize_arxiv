    "discovered nearly half a century ago by harrington & wilson ( @xcite ) on plates of the first palomar sky survey , leoi   remains one of the most studied dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies in the local group ( lg ) .",
    "this galaxy is located far from the galaxy ( about 270 kpc according to lee et al .",
    "@xcite ) and has a radial velocity large enough to raise some doubts about whether it is bound to the milky way ( mw ) system ( zaritsky et al . @xcite ; byrd et al .",
    "ground - based ccd photometry of the red giant branch and main - sequence ( ms ) turnoff have suggested that it is dominated by a metal - poor stellar population with a young mean age , possibly the youngest among dsph s ( lee et al .",
    "@xcite ; demers , irwin , & gambu @xcite ) .",
    "this young mean age has recently been confirmed by deep color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd s ) of a central field observed with the hst / wfpc2 . quantitative analysis of these data has established that most star formation activity occurred between 7 and 1 gyr ago ( caputo et al .",
    "@xcite ; gallart et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    until now , no study has been able to unambiguously detect the presence of an old stellar population .",
    "the hst color - magnitude diagrams show no evidence for the `` flat '' horizontal branch ( hb ) typical of galactic globular clusters and other dwarf spheroidals .",
    "the absence of an old hb or rr lyrae variables led to the conclusion that leoi  is _ a young galaxy _ , in that it started forming stars only as recently as 7 gyr ago .",
    "this conclusion contrasts with the general evidence for dsph s , most of which contain significant populations of very old stars ( see da costa @xcite ; mateo @xcite ) .    still , there are some hints that an old population may actually exist in leoi .",
    "gallart et al .",
    "( @xcite ) noted that old hb stars may contribute to a `` bridge '' of stars from the base of the red clump ( rc ) to the tip of the young main sequence .",
    "caputo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the lower envelope of the subgiant branch is consistent with the presence of an old stellar population in the broad age range 1015 gyr .",
    "further , a preliminary report from a study of the horizontal branch and variable stars in leoi  ( keane et al .",
    "@xcite ) identified a sparse bluer extension of the red clump , and reported the presence of rr lyrae variables . also hodge & wright ( @xcite ) , while pointing out the large number of anomalous cepheids in leoi , had listed a handful of stars near the limit of their photographic photometry as `` probably normal rr lyrae variables caught at maximum '' .    to answer the question of whether leoi  had some star formation starting more than 10 gyr ago",
    ", we have conducted a search for the old population in this galaxy by mapping a wide area with ntt , in sub - arcsecond seeing conditions . in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of an extended ( blue - to - red ) horizontal branch having morphology similar to that observed in other dsph s ( e.g. ,  sculptor and leoii ) .",
    "this result implies that leoi , along with the other dsph s in the local group , underwent a significant early episode of star formation likely coeval to the birth of the oldest galactic globular clusters .",
    "observations of leoi  were obtained on the nights of april 1516 , 1999 using emmi at the eso ntt telescope at la silla , chile .",
    "exposures of 1200 sec in @xmath2  and 600 sec in @xmath3  were obtained as a backup program during periods of non - visibility of the principal targets .",
    "we could observe 4 partially overlapping fields yielding a total field of @xmath4  in both filters .",
    "after the usual preprocessing , the frames were reduced using daophot / allstar  ( stetson @xcite ) .",
    "the photometry was calibrated using observations of landolt ( @xcite ) standard stars , with an r.m.s .",
    "error in the transformations @xmath50.03 mag .",
    "aperture corrections were derived from all the individual frames and compared to estimate a total uncertainty of 0.05 mag in the photometric zero points .",
    "fig .  1 .   the color - magnitude diagram of the outer regions of leoi   revealing the presence of a very old stellar population .",
    "the data were selected outside a radius @xmath6  from the galaxy center .",
    "the lines are the fiducial sequences of the galactic globular clusters ngc  5897 ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 ; _ dashed line _ ) and ngc  5904 ( m5 , [ fe / h]@xmath8 ; _ continuous line _ ) offset to match the distance of leoi  ( data from ferraro , fusi pecci , & buonanno @xcite and sandquist et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the distance and reddening to leoi   were adopted from lee at al .",
    "( @xcite ) , while basic data for the globular clusters are from the updated harris ( @xcite ) catalog .",
    "figure  [ f_cmdtot ] presents the color - magnitude diagram of stars in leoi  having distance from the galaxy center larger than @xmath9   ( 0.35 kpc ) .",
    "this diagram clearly reveals the presence of an extended horizontal branch comprising both red and blue stars .",
    "the rr lyrae gap is evident at @xmath10  and the blue hb turns down near @xmath11 .",
    "the overall hb morphology is therefore similar to that of moderately metal - rich galactic globular clusters . in fig .",
    "[ f_cmdtot ] we have superimposed the fiducial loci of the globular clusters ngc  5897 and ngc  5904 , whose metallicities are [ fe / h]@xmath7  and @xmath12 , respectively ( harris @xcite ) .",
    "the red giant branch of leoi  appears consistent with a metal abundance intermediate between those of the clusters , i.e. @xmath5[fe / h]@xmath13 .",
    "the old hb coexists with the well - known red clump of the dominant intermediate - age population , and with the more massive ( @xmath14  @xmath15 caputo et al .",
    "@xcite ) helium - burning stars making up the yellow plume just above the rc , sometimes referred to as `` vertical red clump '' ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "the mean apparent magnitude of the hb , @xmath18 , confirms the distance modulus inferred from the tip of the red giant branch ( lee et al .",
    "@xcite ) . a full discussion of the distance to leoi  based on the mean magnitude of the old hb will be presented elsewhere .    a close - up view of the hb population in leoi  is shown in fig .  [ f_hbpanel ] .",
    "the top panel shows the diagram of helium burning stars beyond @xmath19  ( @xmath200.2 kpc ) . only stars having small daophot  errors ( @xmath21 ) have been plotted , resulting in a quite sharp magnitude cutoff at @xmath22 . by applying a more restrictive radial selection ( @xmath23 ) , in the middle panel",
    "we emphasize the rr  lyrae gap and the downturn of the blue hb .",
    "the hb region in the cmd  of the globular cluster m5 ( ngc  5904 ; data from sandquist et al .",
    "@xcite ) is also shown for comparison ( bottom panel ) .",

    "stars in leoi  at galactocentric distances @xmath24  ( upper panel ) and @xmath23 ( mid panel ) are compared with the cmd  of the galactic globular clusters m5 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the cmd  of the intermediate - outer region , shown in the top panel , clearly comprises helium burning stars of different ages and masses .",
    "the old hb exhibits a complex structure , with a spread in luminosity .",
    "the oldest stars in leoi  are more clearly seen in the cmd  of the outer region ( mid panel ) .",
    "the morphology of the old hb of leoi  appears notably similar to that of the intermediate - metallicity globular cluster ngc  5904 ( sandquist et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , we note the following .",
    "\\(i ) the downturn of the blue hb is similar in the two diagrams .",
    "the blue hb sequence of leoi  is truncated with respect to the more extended blue tail of m5 , a difference only partially due to incompleteness ( cf .",
    "[ f_cmdtot ] ) .",
    "( ii ) a small population of stars slightly brighter than the hb , most likely stars in post - hb evolutionary stages , is quite evident in both the leoi  and m5 diagrams .",
    "the stars near the gap probably are rr lyrae variables .",
    "the stars brighter than the hb are consistent with the post - hb isochrones of stars with initial hb masses 0.6 0.7 @xmath15  and metallicity z=0.001 ( bertelli et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the small clump of stars @xmath201 mag brighter than the hb ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( hb ",
    "agb)@xmath27 ) , clearly marks the bottom of the asymptotic giants branch of the old population ( agb ) .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the hb morphology of the _ old population _ in leoi  was attempted by excluding the stars on the red clump .",
    "the blue and red hb stars were counted in the intervals @xmath28  and @xmath29 , in the magnitude range @xmath30  ( the bluest box was actually a trapezoid matching the downturn of the blue hb ) .",
    "the color range @xmath31  approximately corresponds to the rr lyrae gap , and stars counted in that interval were taken as representative of variable stars .",
    "the lee - zinn index @xmath32   was calculated in the two radial intervals @xmath33  and @xmath34 , obtaining @xmath35  and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the errors are formal uncertainties from poisson statistics . given our stringent choice of the redder box",
    ", these estimates should be properly regarded as upper limits to @xmath37 , and experiments varying the limits of the color intervals suggest that the morphology index is in the range @xmath38 . using the same intervals as above to define the blue and red hb ,",
    "the corresponding mironov parameter @xmath39  is 0.43 and 0.44 for the intermediate and outer region .",
    "the hb index can not be estimated in the inner region ( @xmath40  or 0.21 kpc ) due to the higher crowding and photometric errors , and the contamination from young ms stars .",
    "this region approximately corresponding to a core radius ( the mean half - brightness radius is 0.18 kpc ",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou @xcite ) .",
    "note that , for the intermediate and outer regions , there is no evidence of variations in the hb morphology with radius .",
    "these results for the index @xmath37  indicate a uniform old hb having at least as many stars in the red as in the blue part . when the [ fe / h ] vs. hb - type diagram ( lee , demarque , & zinn @xcite ) is used to compare the hb morphology of leoi  with that of globular clusters in local group galaxies , the old hb of leoi  turns out to be significantly redder that those of old galactic clusters of similar metallicity , and similar to those of the young halo clusters ( we assume that the old population in leoi  is nearly as metal - poor as ngc  5897 , i.e.  [ fe / h]@xmath41 ) .",
    "this result provides a new ( mild ) example of the `` second parameter '' effect in dwarf spheroidals .",
    "plot of the radial surface density profiles of stars in leoi : hb stars ( filled triangles ) , intermediate - age red clump stars ( open triangles ) , and red giants ( open squares ) . see text for details . the surface density profile of hb stars in leoi",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_radprof ] , along with the surface densities of red clump and rgb stars .",
    "the number of old hb stars was counted in the cmd  region @xmath42 , @xmath43 , in radial annuli starting from the innermost radius @xmath44   ( 0.16 kpc ) .",
    "the cmd  regions used for counting the red clump stars and red giants are @xmath45 , @xmath46  and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "these density profiles have been shifted to match the profile of hb stars .",
    "the foreground contamination is negligible in all of these regions .",
    "figure  [ f_radprof ] shows that , outside approximately a core radius , the surface densities of old hb and red clump stars are basically consistent in leoi , i.e.  the old and intermediate - age populations have similar spatial scale lengths .",
    "a population change is not ruled out in the innermost region , though . by assuming a constant central surface density of @xmath49  hb stars per arcmin@xmath50  ( see fig .",
    "[ f_radprof ] ) , we estimate that @xmath2080 old hb stars are expected in the wfpc2 field , a number that , if present , would easily have been detected in the hst color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "our detection of a blue horizontal branch in leoi  unambiguously indicates the existence of an underlying old stellar population in this galaxy .",
    "the observation that leoi  is not a young galaxy in the sense of having been born in the last few gyr lends universal validity , within the local group , to the idea that dwarf spheroidal galaxies formed at an early epoch essentially coeval to the formation of old galactic globular clusters .      before expanding further on the consequences of this result , however , we briefly comment on the observed morphology of the hb in leoi  and its radial trends .",
    "the overall hb morphology is similar to the extended horizontal branches found in other metal - poor dwarf spheroidals / ellipticals , in particular leoii  ( demers & irwin @xcite ) , sculptor ( e.g. ,  kaluzny et al .",
    "@xcite ) , tucana ( lavery et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and andi  ( da costa et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to summarize our results , in leoi",
    "we have found that ( i ) the hb morphology provides yet another example of second parameter effect , similar to that of sculptor , leoii , and other dsph s ; ( ii ) the old and intermediate age populations have similar scale lengths ; and ( iii ) neither the ratio of hb to red clump stars nor the hb morphology show any variations in the intermediate / outer regions .    in the context of dsph galaxies ,",
    "the `` second parameter effect '' is usually interpreted as due to an age spread .",
    "if age is the second parameter , then the mean age of the _ old population _ in leoi  should be comparable to that of the young globular clusters in the galactic halo .",
    "an age range within the old population can probably explain the observed second parameter effect .",
    "a possible interpretation for leoi  is that the `` old component '' actually represents a star formation episode of finite duration , so that the extended hb reflects a mix of stars in the age interval 1015 gyr .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the old - hb morphology in leoi  ( as well as in other dsph s ) is influenced by the same physical `` second parameter '' that governs the hb in globular clusters .",
    "the absence of a radial population and hb morphology gradient in the intermediate / outer regions of leoi  reminds us of the case of the carina dsph , where smecker - hane et al .",
    "( @xcite ) also found no difference in the distribution of the red clump stars and the hb of old stars .",
    "this implies uniformity in the population mix , and suggests that the size of these galaxies has not significantly changed since their initial star formation epoch .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the results for other dsph s , where the intermediate - age population commonly appears to be more centrally concentrated than the oldest component .",
    "the radial gradient in the hb morphology of andi , leoii , and sculptor have been discussed by da costa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "two recent studies of sculptor have shown that the red hb stars are more centrally concentrated than the dominant old population , and almost vanish in the outer region ( hurley - keller et al .",
    "@xcite ; majewski et al .",
    "majewski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) interpret this variations in hb morphology as due to two overlapping hb s , belonging to two distinct populations with different metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath51   and @xmath52 , respectively ) and radial distribution ( however , hurley - keller et al .",
    "@xcite find no radial gradients of the age or metallicity distribution ) .",
    "a clear gradient in the relative distribution of hb stars , implying a variation in the mean age and/or abundance with radius , was also found in ngc  147 , fornax , and phoenix ( han et al .",
    "@xcite ; stetson et al .",
    "@xcite ; saviane , held , & bertelli @xcite ) ; held , saviane , & momany @xcite ) .",
    "the reason why leoi  and carina deviate from this general scenario for the evolution of dwarf spheroidals remains to be understood .",
    "we now comment on our detection of very old stars in leoi  in the context of recent results on the old populations in the local group .",
    "recent work has provided evidence for a coeval early generation of globular clusters in most galaxies throughout the local group .",
    "harris et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that ngc  2419 , a metal - poor cluster located in the remote milky way halo , has the same age , to within @xmath53  gyr , as m92 .",
    "globular clusters in the fornax dsph also appear to have essentially the same age as mw globular clusters of similar metallicity , although with a very different hb morphology ( buonanno et al .",
    "a similarly old age has been inferred for the oldest globular clusters in m33 , m31 , the large magellanic cloud ( sarajedini et al . @xcite ; and references therein ) , and for the unique globular cluster in wlm ( hodge et al .",
    "therefore the earliest star formation seems to have been coeval in all parts of the milky way protogalaxy ( harris et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but also across the local group many galaxies have experienced their first epoch of _ cluster",
    "_ formation at around the same time 1315 gyr ago ( sarajedini et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our discovery of an old hb in leoi  allows us to state that a significant old component is present in _ all of the local group dwarf spheroidals_. extended hb s and/or rr  lyrae variables are known in all of the dsph / de dwarfs the local group , including both the de / dsph satellites in the m31 and galaxy subgroups and the few dwarfs sitting ( as leoi ) in isolated locations ( da costa @xcite ; mateo @xcite ) .",
    "circumstantial evidence for halos of old stars also exist in local group dwarf irregulars ( e.g. ,  minniti , zijlstra , & alonso @xcite ; cole et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the presence of an old population has been confirmed in ic  1613 by detection of rr  lyrae ( saha et al .",
    "thus , the finding that the oldest globular clusters share a common early formation epoch can be extended to the stellar _ field populations _ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the old globular cluster systems and the dwarf spheroidals underwent their first star formation episode at a single common early epoch , irrespective of the environment they inhabit in the local group , and of their subsequent star formation history . building the early generation of stars in a narrow time interval is clearly necessary to explain the nearly simultaneous birth of stars in a variety of galaxies and local group environments more than 10 gyr ago .",
