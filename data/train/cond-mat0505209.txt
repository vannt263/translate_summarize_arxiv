    "despite the wide use in statistical physics , long - range interacting systems , that is those systems characterized by a pairwise interaction decaying as a power law of the mutual distance with an exponent @xmath9 less than the embedding dimension , do not have a well defined thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "also is it not at all clear whether their equilibrium properties can be described by the ordinary tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "for instance , the nonequivalence between the microcanonical and the canonical approach has been recently found in a long - range rotators model in the thermodynamic limit@xcite .    besides these relevant implications in the foundation of statistical mechanics and in theoretical physics as well@xcite , the non - extensive behavior of long range systems",
    "has nowadays become important for applications too , ranging from neural systems@xcite to spin glasses@xcite .    within the class of long - range interacting systems , classical spin models , widely investigated during the last years@xcite ,",
    "are the most easy - to - handle both from the analytical and the numerical point of view . within such class of systems ,",
    "( to be more precise , a class of anisotropic heisenberg models ) the existence of a threshold of disconnection in the energy surface has been demonstrated@xcite for an interparticle interaction with infinite range .",
    "it has been called non - ergodicity threshold for historical reasons@xcite , even if the term can generate some confusion .",
    "indeed non - ergodicity is only an obvious consequence : it simply means that the energy surface is topologically disconnected in two regions characterized by positive and negative magnetization . in other words it can not exist a dynamical path connecting them and all trajectories starting from one region of the phase space stay there forever .",
    "for this reason we prefer here to call it topological non - connectivity threshold ( tnt ) .",
    "the presence of the tnt can not be considered an exotic mathematical peculiarity of some toy model .",
    "its dynamical relevance has been studied in @xcite , where an explicit expression for the reversal times of the magnetization ( the time necessary to jump from one branch to the other ) has been given in the neighbors of the critical energy point .",
    "reversal times diverge at the tnt as a power law with an exponent dependent on the number of the particles ( and , probably , on the embedding dimension ) as in ordinary phase transitions . strictly speaking ,",
    "even if in different context and for different models , the relationship between energy thresholds and topology transitions in the configuration space of classical spin models has been recently investigated@xcite .    also ,",
    "while the threshold was explicitly found within a class of anisotropic classical heisenberg models with an easy axis of magnetization and all - to - all constant interaction , at the same time systems with nearest neighbor interaction were found to have a different behavior .",
    "for instance , the portion of disconnected energy region grows with the number of particles @xmath8 , less than the energy itself , thus resulting in a zero ratio in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "needless to say , such ratio stays finite for anisotropic coupling and all to all interaction .",
    "while this feature is surely due to the anisotropy of the coupling ( such finite ratio disappears for isotropic coupling even in the case of infinite range interaction ) , the question arises whether the presence of the tnt can be considered a pathological effect of the unphysical infinite interaction range or it is just somehow related with the long - range effects .",
    "this does not represent an academic question . indeed , despite the possible applications of such model even in the case of all - to - all interaction@xcite , physical models require taking into account more realistic interactions , usually anisotropic@xcite and depending generically from the inter ",
    "spin distance , as for the dipole - dipole coupling or when the spin is coupled with the electron spin of the conduction band of a metal , e.g. the rkky model @xcite .",
    "this leads quite naturally to hamiltonians with an interparticle potential decaying as a generic power law with an exponent @xmath9 of the relative distance @xmath3 .",
    "the results found in ref.@xcite can thus be recovered by letting respectively @xmath10 ( all to all coupling ) or @xmath11 ( nearest neighbor coupling ) .    here",
    ", we extend the previous results to the whole class of models with an inverse power distance potential and show that @xmath12 is a critical exponent for non - connectivity in @xmath13 chains .    in general , the extension to higher dimensions is far from trivial , both numerically and analytically .",
    "however , we prove that the tnt , if any , can not `` survive '' ( and we will specify the precise meaning below ) when @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "numerical simulations in @xmath16d and @xmath17d also suggest that , for @xmath18 , the ratio between the disconnected energy region and the total energy range is finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we thus conjecture that the tnt is a generic property of anisotropic long - range systems in any dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian is a simple generalization of that considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin vector with continuous components and modulus @xmath21 , @xmath8 is the number of spins , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is an anisotropic coefficient , and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 . for definiteness",
    "we consider here only the case of an even number @xmath8 of classical spins .",
    "such kind of models are characterized by a minimal and maximal energy @xmath26 , and by a finite energy range @xmath27 that we call energy spectrum ( es ) . in order to define properly the disconnection threshold ,",
    "let us introduce the set @xmath28 of all spin configurations with a zero projection of the total magnetization along the @xmath29-axis : @xmath30 the tnt is thus defined as : @xmath31 , \\label{eds}\\ ] ] and the spin configurations corresponding to @xmath32 will be indicated as @xmath33 . here",
    "we are mainly interested in all those cases where the tnt , if any , occupies a significant portion of the es in the thermodynamic limit . for",
    "this reason let us define the disconnection ratio : @xmath34 a system will be considered _ disconnected _ only if @xmath35 _ const .",
    "@xmath36 , when @xmath14 .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath37 given in eq .",
    "( [ erre ] ) has a meaning only for systems with a bounded energy range .",
    "a dynamical consequence of the tnt is that below it , a sample with a given initial magnetization @xmath38 , can not change the sign of @xmath38 for any time , since the constant energy surface is disconnected in a positive and a negative magnetization regions , thus no continuous dynamics can bring an isolated system from one region to the other .",
    "our proof will follow two steps : in the first part we find the minima of the @xmath39 and @xmath29 parts separately",
    ". then we will show that the disconnected ratio goes to zero for long - range interaction , while it goes to some finite constant in the short range case .",
    "roughly speaking , since hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is independent of the @xmath40-component of spins , the minimum will occur when the spins are as large as possible in ( [ ham ] ) , namely in the @xmath41 plane .    in order to prove that the configuration @xmath33 effectively lies in the @xmath41 plane ,",
    "let us assume that it has some @xmath42 component different from zero .",
    "for definiteness assume @xmath43 .",
    "it is then possible to define another configuration @xmath44 simply making a rotation around the @xmath29-axis clockwise or counterclockwise which puts the spin @xmath45 onto the plane @xmath41 .",
    "the energy difference between these two configurations can be computed at glance : @xmath46 here the different sign @xmath47 indicates the different way ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) of rotation . since @xmath48 , it is then clear that , according to this sign it is always possible to rotate in such a way to have @xmath49 .    the same procedure can be applied @xmath50 times for any other @xmath51 , so that we will end with a configuration @xmath52 ( the rotation does not change the constraint ) with energy @xmath53 .",
    "we can therefore consider the configurations in the @xmath41 plane .",
    "this choice has the main advantage that it is sufficient to consider as independent variables the angles @xmath54 of the @xmath55-th spin w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath39-axis , thus satisfying automatically the conditions on the unit spin modulus : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore we have to minimize the following expression : @xmath58 under the constraint @xmath59 . since @xmath60 a lower bound of @xmath32 can be provided finding the minima of the two terms in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ boh ] ) .",
    "note that the first term on the right of eq.([boh ] ) does not contain constraints , indeed we will show in the next section that the absolute minimum of @xmath61 automatically satisfied the constraint @xmath62 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath61 due to the overall plus sign ( @xmath63 ) , can be obtained as in a standard anti - ferromagnetic spin system with neighbors interaction , that is disposing alternatively the spins along the @xmath39-axis as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    indeed , for any @xmath9 ,",
    "let us call the @xmath66 spin component @xmath67 and rewrite the energy as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are constants independent of @xmath70 .",
    "there are two possibilities , @xmath71 or @xmath72 . in the first case",
    "the energy @xmath73 turns out to be independent of the @xmath66 spin , while for @xmath72 , the minimum is attained when @xmath70 has its maximal value ( @xmath64 if @xmath74 , @xmath65 if @xmath75 ) .",
    "so , in any case we can say that the minimum occurs when @xmath76 .",
    "since the procedure can be iterated for all spins components , the minimum occurs when @xmath77 for any @xmath78 , namely in the class of ising models @xmath79 with @xmath80 and long range interaction .",
    "we still have to prove that the minimal energy is obtained when the spins have alternating signs . to this end",
    ", let us consider the interaction between two neighbor spin pairs , the @xmath81-th , namely @xmath82 and the @xmath83-th , namely @xmath84 ( this can be done since there is an even number of spins ) .",
    "there are 16 possibilities but only six of them have different energy due to the symmetry on the whole change of sign .",
    "they are : @xmath85    from the monotonicity of the function @xmath86 one gets , @xmath87 imposing @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89 that holds from the convexity property of @xmath86 .    since @xmath90 is minimal for each pair interaction , the absolute minimum will be obtained using , for each pair , the configuration @xmath91 the energy @xmath73 for this configuration can be computed immediately : @xmath92    let us notice that such a result is far from being obvious .",
    "indeed a decreasing non - convex function @xmath86 could give rise to a different minimal configuration .      .",
    "a ) for fixed @xmath94 and different @xmath8 values as indicated in the legend ; b ) for fixed @xmath95 and different @xmath4 values ( see the legend ) . ]",
    "let us now switch to the more difficult task ( due to the constraint ) of computing @xmath96 .",
    "physically , due to the overall minus sign in front of @xmath93 , one can expect that clusters of aligned spin with unit modulus ( ferromagnetic order ) will decrease the energy with respect to other configurations .",
    "this is surely true for nearest neighbor interaction ( @xmath97 ) but it can not be true for all @xmath9 values .",
    "for instance , when @xmath98 , the energy corresponding to the configuration with half spins equal to @xmath21 and half equal to @xmath65 ( the order is irrelevant ) is @xmath99 , while the true minimum @xmath100 is attained when all spins are @xmath101",
    ".    then , the question arises of what can be the minimum in presence of a generic @xmath9 .    applying the standard lagrange multipliers formalism",
    ", one has to minimize the function : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the lagrange multiplier associated to @xmath62 .    taking the derivatives , we get , for each spin , two possible solutions : @xmath104 however , solving , even numerically , the system ( [ lagi],[lagii ] ) is more difficult than finding directly the minimum .",
    "we have therefore calculated the minimal configuration under constraint , using an iterative optimization approach based on the ffsqp solver @xcite and also developing the following approach outlined here below .    *",
    "start with a random configuration with @xmath62 .",
    "* chose for the @xmath66 spin a new value between @xmath105 to @xmath21 and compute the energy .",
    "this generally produces a change in magnetization @xmath106 . *",
    "distribute equally @xmath106 among the other spins taking into account the constraint about their modulus .",
    "specifically subtract / add to every spin the minimum of its distance from the values @xmath107 and the mean of @xmath108 .",
    "* iterate over all spins up to an energy variation less than some fixed value ( from @xmath109 to @xmath110 in our simulations ) .",
    "the two approaches give the same result : for any initial random configuration the algorithm described above converges to some smooth configuration , for any finite @xmath8 and @xmath111 , as indicated in fig .",
    "there , we considered respectively the case of @xmath9 fixed varying @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ af]a ) , and @xmath8 fixed varying @xmath9 ( fig .  [ af]b ) . within the numerical errors",
    "the spins in the minimal energy configuration are distributed monotonically and anti - symmetrically w.r.t .",
    "the center of the chain .",
    "then we assume that @xmath112 is given by an anti - symmetric distribution of the spin with a non - decreasing ( or non increasing ) monotonic dependence of the @xmath113 spin component along the chain .",
    "an interesting feature is the presence of a finite domain wall ( defined by those spins having length less than @xmath21 ) between two clusters with @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) respectively . with decreasing range of interaction ( increasing @xmath9 : fig .",
    "[ af]b ) or increasing number of spins ( fig .",
    "[ af]a ) , the interface region between the clusters ( @xmath115 ) and ( @xmath117 ) decreases .",
    "this agrees , at least qualitatively , with the results obtained for the nearest neighbor model ( @xmath97 ) where the minimal configuration is given by @xmath118    thus , due to long range interaction , an interface region between the two clusters with opposite magnetization is produced .",
    "it is , of course , physically relevant to understand if the size of the interface region goes to zero in the @xmath119 limit .    strictly speaking the configuration @xmath120 is not an absolute minimum for any @xmath111 and finite @xmath8 . in order to prove that , consider the configuration @xmath121 with @xmath122 spins satisfying condition ( [ lagi ] ) and the two central ones satisfying the condition ( [ lagii ] ) .",
    "the energy @xmath123 corresponding to @xmath124 can be written as @xmath125 , \\label{edis}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is independent of @xmath70 .",
    "the minimum is thus obtained when @xmath127 .",
    "the energy difference to @xmath128 is @xmath129 therefore , for any finite chain and finite @xmath9 , @xmath130 .",
    "physically , @xmath124 has an energy less than @xmath131 due to border effects .",
    "indeed the energy of two opposite spins of length @xmath21 is @xmath132 , while it is only @xmath133 for two shorter spins @xmath134 . on the other hand the interaction between @xmath70 ( @xmath135 ) and the other spins of length @xmath21 ( @xmath65 )",
    "is canceled one to one but the interaction with the closest spin ( @xmath136 ) and with the last opposite one ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this gives eq.([edis ] ) .",

    "the same procedure can be applied taking a trial configuration with energy @xmath138 : @xmath139    in this case a minimum with @xmath140 can be found only for @xmath141 .",

    "in this last part we briefly discuss the case @xmath250 .",
    "first of all @xmath251 is not a necessary condition for the existence of a finite disconnection region .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath21d case ; in eq .",
    "( [ boh ] ) @xmath252 becomes ferromagnetic as @xmath93 , and the configuration @xmath253 has an energy @xmath254 ( which is the energy of the configuration @xmath255 , see eq .",

    "moreover , since the number of parallel spins in @xmath256 is larger than in @xmath131 , we will expect that the energy @xmath257 , even if decreased by a factor @xmath22 , will become soon or later less than @xmath120 .    while this has no consequences in the case @xmath170 , ( we still have @xmath258 and the tnt does not exist ) , in the long - range case ( @xmath156 ) some interesting features appear .    from eq .",
    "( [ erre1 ] ) one has @xmath259 for @xmath14 and a finite disconnection energy region still exists for @xmath260 .    in the other case @xmath261 nothing",
    "can be said , even if , according to our numerical simulations @xmath262 .",

    "can see @xmath32 is close to @xmath257 ( equal , within numerical accuracy , according to our simulations ) for @xmath264 , while it becomes close to @xmath120 , for @xmath265 . that holds true in any dimensions .",
    "let us note that , as a realistic @xmath266 , we can assume the intersection point between @xmath257 and @xmath120 , see fig .",

    "it is also clear that assuming : @xmath272 one has @xmath273 , and the system is disconnected even for negative @xmath22 in all dimensions .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the occurrence of a topological non  connectivity threshold ( tnt ) in anisotropic heisenberg models in @xmath263 with an interaction strength depending on a power law of their relative distance with the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "we have found that the system , in the thermodynamic limit , is disconnected only in presence of a long - range interaction @xmath274 . on the other side , in the short - range case , the ratio between the disconnected energy region and the total energy region goes to zero when @xmath14 .",
    "the anisotropy represents in this class of systems a necessary condition : indeed , in the isotropic case , the tnt coincides with the minimal energy , thus there is no disconnected energy region .",
    "future investigations concern the experimental evidence of tnt , for instance by looking for the divergence of de - magnetization times@xcite as a function of energy in small magnetic samples .",
    "finally , let us point out that from a quantum mechanical point of view the classical disconnection does not exclude the flipping of the magnetization through macroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of tnt could give the possibility to study the emergence of macroscopic quantum phenomena in a wide energy range ( for macroscopic long range interacting systems ) , as has been shown in @xcite , where the quantum signatures of the tnt in an anisotropic heisenberg model with all - to - all interaction have been studied , and the relevance of the tnt w.r.t .",
