    "a connection between optimal states obtained from the _ principle of minimum distance in the space of quantum states _ ( pmd - sqs ) [ 17 ]  and the most stringent ( maxent ) entropic bounds on tsallis - like entropies for quantum scattering , is established .",
    "the nonextensivity indices p and q are determined from the experimental entropies by a fit with the optimal entropies @xmath19 , @xmath9 $ ] . in this way",

    ". then knowledge about the hadron - hadron scattering system ( or more concretely , about partial amplitudes ) are deduced by assuming that the scattering system behaves as to optimize some given measure of the system effectiveness , e.g. , _",
    "the distance in the hilbert space of scattering states .",
    "_ thus the behavior of the scattering system is completely specified by those variational variables ( e.g. , the partial scattering amplitudes ) which are obtained by applying constrained optimization to its effectiveness .",
    "the pmd - sqs - optimum principle was formulated in a more general mathematical form by using _ reproducing kernel hilbert spaces methods _ [ 17 - 19 ] .",
