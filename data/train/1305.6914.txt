    "semiclassical approach of quantum gravity theory is known as quantum matter field theory propagated on a curved space - time , in which a classically treated curved space - time is perturbed by a suitable quantum matter field @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem in this version of the quantum gravity theory , is calculation of renormalized expectation value of quantum matter stress tensor operator @xmath0 .",
    "renormalization theory give us a suitable theoretical prediction , in which expectation value of a singular quantum field stress tensor operator reduces to a nonsingular quantity contained an anomalous trace .",
    "this nonsingular stress tensor treats as source in rhs of the einsteins gravity equation such as follows .",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is einstein tensor with the perturbed metric @xmath3 and the background metric @xmath4 @xmath5 is positive cosmological constant and @xmath6 is classical baryonic matter or non - baryonic dark matter field stress tensor . non - minimally coupled scalar dark matter fields with a negative value of equation of state parameter may to be come originally from effects of conformal frames .",
    "the latter case of the matter is a good candidate to explain positivity accelerated expansion of the universe and to remove the naked singularity of the universe in quantum cosmological approach .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the above equation which is written in units @xmath7 is called the metric back - reaction equation .",
    "there are presented several methods for the renormalization prescription , namely dimensional regularization , point splitting , adiabatic and hadamared renormalization prescriptions @xcite .",
    "the latter method has distinctions with respect to the other methods of the renormalization prescriptions .",
    "hadamared renormalization prescription is described in terms of hadamared states and it predicts few conditions on unknown quantum vacuum state of an arbitrary interacting quantum field @xcite .",
    "hence it provides the most direct and logical approach to the renormalization problem for practical calculations .",
    "furthermore it is well defined for both massive and massless fields .",

    "the conformal coupling reduces to minimal coupling and so the quantity of trace anomaly is obtained in terms of the ricci scalar @xmath13 which for a massless scalar matter field become : @xmath14 the main problem in the equation ( 1 ) is to fined @xmath0 coupled with an arbitrary non - static and non - spherically symmetric dynamical metric .",
    "but there are many degrees of freedom and inherent complexity on four dimensional solutions of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "there are obtained in detail only for class of four dimensional spherically symmetric space times which are treated as two dimensional curved space times , because the spherically symmetric condition on four dimensional space times eliminates the extra degrees of freedom of equation ( 1 ) @xcite .",
    "two dimensional analog of the renormalization theory and solutions of the back - reaction equation is used to determine final state of spherically symmetric dilatonic and also non - dilatonic evaporating black holes metric by several authors .",
    "for instance strominger et al were obtained a nonsingular metric for final state of an evaporating two dimensional dilatonic massive black hole @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that an evaporating two dimensional dilatonic reissner nordestrm black hole reduces to a remnant , stable nonsingular space time .",

    "it is shown by balbinot et al that the hawking evaporation @xcite of the two dimensional non - dilatonic schwarzschild black hole is stopped @xcite .",
    "back reaction corrections of conformaly invariant quantum scalar field in the hartle hawking vacuum state @xcite was used to determine quantum perturbed metric of a non - dilatonic reissner nordstrm black hole by wang et al @xcite .",
    "they followed the york approach where a small quantity @xmath15 is introduced to solve the metric back - reaction equation ( 1 ) by applying the perturbation method @xcite . + furthermore noncommutative quantum field theory in curved space times and",
    "so generalized uncertainty principle derived from string theory @xcite , is other quantum gravity approach in which the space - time points might be noncommutative @xcite .",
    "the latter quantum gravity model is also predicts remnant stable mini - quantum black hole where the hawking radiation process finishes when black hole approaches to its planck scale with a nonzero temperature @xcite .",
    "+ according to the perturbation method presented by the york , we solve in this paper , two dimensional analog of the metric back - reaction equation ( 1 ) and determine final state of an evaporating lukewarm black hole .",
    "this kind of a black hole is a special class of reissner nordstrm de sitter spherically symmetric static black hole where mass parameter is equal to the charge parameter . according to the work presented by christensen and fulling",
    "@xcite we obtain the renormalized stress tensor components of black hole hawking radiation in terms of a nonlocal contribution of the trace anomaly .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "+ in section 2 , we define lukewarm classical black hole metric and obtain locations of its event horizons . in section 3 , we derive thermal radiation stress tensor operator expectation value of a massless , charge - less quantum matter scalar field propagating on the black hole metric . having the obtained hawking radiation quantum stress tensor",

    "lukewarm black holes are a particular class of reissner nordstrm - de sitter , with @xmath19 for @xmath20 we have three distinct horizons , namely black hole event horizon at @xmath21 inner cauchy horizon at @xmath22 and cosmological horizon at @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 while the event horizon is formed by the gravitational potential of the black hole , the cosmological horizon is formed as a result of the expansion of the universe due to the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "an observer located between the two horizons is causally isolated from the region within the event horizon , as well as from the region outside the cosmological horizon .",
    "the above line element is exterior metric of a spherically symmetric static body with mass @xmath27 and charge @xmath28 .",

    "we will consider that the interacting quantum scalar field to be charge - less and so has not electromagnetic action with the classical electric field stress tensor @xmath6 defined by ( 8) .",
    "so we can suppose that the electric charge of the black hole is not perturbed by the quantum scalar field .",
    "also we will assume that the quantum scalar field is propagated in s ( spherically ) mode on the spherically symmetric background metric ( 3 ) and so its @xmath50 and @xmath51 components are perturbed by the renormalized expectation value of quantum field stress tensor operator @xmath52>_{ren}.$ ] applying the latter assumption one can use two dimensional analog of the quantum field back - reaction corrections on the metric such as follows .",

    "<S> we obtain renormalized stress tensor of a mass - less , charge - less dynamical quantum scalar field , minimally coupled with a spherically symmetric static lukewarm black hole . in two dimensional analog </S>",
    "<S> the minimal coupling reduces to the conformal coupling and the stress tensor is found to be determined by the nonlocal contribution of the anomalous trace and some additional parameters in close relation to the work presented by christensen and fulling . </S>",
    "<S> lukewarm black holes are a special class of reissner- nordstrm - de sitter space times where its electric charge is equal to its mass . having the obtained renormalized </S>",
    "<S> stress tensor we attempt to obtain a time - independent solution of the well known metric back reaction equation . </S>",
    "<S> mathematical derivations predict that the final state of an evaporating quantum lukewarm black hole reduces to a remnant stable mini black hole with moved locations of the horizons . </S>",
    "<S> namely the perturbed black hole ( cosmological ) horizon is compressed ( extended ) to scales which is smaller ( larger ) than the corresponding classical radius of the event horizons . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is not obtained an deviation on the cosmic sensor - ship hypothesis . </S>"
