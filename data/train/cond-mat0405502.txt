    "the interaction of the polarization of biological cells with the applied fields has resulted in a wide range of practical applications from manipulation , trapping to separation of biological cells  @xcite , and even nanotechnology  @xcite . when a biological cell in medium is exposed to an applied electric field",
    ", there is an accumulation of charge at the interfaces and hence a dipole moment is induced in the cell .",
    "the strength of the polarization depends on the frequency of the applied field as well as on the permittivities and conductivities of cells and medium .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when we consider structured particles because biological cells are usually modeled as conductive spheres ( cytosol ) with a thin insulating outer shell ( membrane ) , assuming the shell is an isotropic , non - dispersive dielectric with conductive losses . in this case",
    ", there are additional frequency - dependent changes in the polarization .    the clausius - mossotti ( cm ) factor determines the polarization of a biological particle in a surrounding medium , and is a measure of the dielectric contrast between the particle and medium .",
    "the cm factor is important in biophysical research because it is closely related to the alternating current ( ac ) electrokinetic behaviors of biological cells , namely , dielectrophoresis  @xcite , electrorotation  @xcite , electro - orientation  @xcite , electrofusion  @xcite , as well as electrodeformation  @xcite .",
    "any change in the cell s properties such as the mobile charges , or particle shape as well as the variation of medium conductivity or medium permittivity will change the cm factor , which is in turn reflected in the ac electrokinetic spectra .",
    "these spectra show characteristic frequency - dependent changes amongst other complicated features .    moreover , the conductivities and permittivities can have characteristic frequency dependencies due to the presence of mobile charges in membrane .",
    "thus the constancy of these quantities is only an approximation and these quantities do change with frequency , giving rise to additional dispersions . in this work",
    ", we aim to establish a dielectric dispersion spectral representation ( ddsr ) for the single - shell spherical cell model with an intrinsic dielectric dispersion in the cytosol .",
    "the ddsr was pioneered by maxwell @xcite in 1891 in the context of interfacial polarization .",
    "when two media are put in contact ( thus forming an interface ) and an electric field is applied , polarization charge is induced at the interface due to the dielectric contrast between the two media . although maxwell considered a two phase system in which one phase is insulating , it can be readily generalized to a more general case when both media have complex dielectric permittivities .",
    "the ddsr was subsequently extended to spherical particles by lei _",
    "_  @xcite and further elaborated by gao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for cell models without shells , the single - shell model has been widely used to mimic a living biological cell as a homogeneous , nondispersive spherical particle surrounded by a thin shell corresponding to the plasma membrane .",
    "the ddsr enables us to express the cm factor analytically in terms of a series of sub - dispersions , each of which with analytic expressions for the dispersion strengths and their corresponding characteristic frequencies expressed in terms of the various parameters of the cell model  @xcite .",
    "thus this representation enables us to assess in detail the influence of the various model parameters , including structural , material , as well as dynamic properties of cells , without the need to analyze the full dielectric dispersion spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the dielectric dispersion spectral representation ( ddsr ) for the cm factor of an unshelled spherical cell model  @xcite to establish notations .",
    "we express the dispersion strength as well as the characteristic frequency of the cm factor analytically in terms of the parameters of the cell model .",
    "then an intrinsic dielectric dispersion is included in the cell  @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we analyze the single - shell model with a dispersive core and a non - dispersive , insulating shell .",
    "we apply ddsr to the cm factor to obtain the analytic expressions for the dispersion strengths and characteristic frequencies .",
    "these expressions enable us to assess the influence of various model parameters on the electrokinetics of cells . in section iv",
    ", we examine the influence of the individual parameters , such as the conductivities of the external medium and the cytosol on the dispersion spectra .",
    "various interesting behaviours will be obtained . in section",
    "v , we extend our considerations to a graded core , namely , the core can have spatial gradients in the conductivity and/or permittivity .",
    "we address the effects of a graded profile in a small - gradient expansion in the general framework of ddsr .",
    "discussion and conclusion will be given in section vi .",
    "in this section , we review the dielectric dispersion spectral representation for the cm ( clausius - mossotti ) factor of an unshelled spherical cell model  @xcite .",
    "the dipole moment @xmath0 of a single sphere in uniform electric field  @xcite p = _ e  u  d^3 8  e_0 where @xmath1 is the permittivity of the external medium , @xmath2 is the diameter of the particle and @xmath3 is the electric field strength .",
    "@xmath4 is the cm factor due to the dielectric discontinuity and follows the equation u = _ i - _ e _ i + 2_e where @xmath5 is the permittivity of the particle . in ac applied fields , we replace the permittivities with their complex counterparts : _",
    "i = _ i + _ i i , + _ e = _ e + _ e i , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are conductivities of the particle and of the external medium respectively .",
    "then u = _ i^ * - _ e^ * + 2_e^ * this gives the dielectric relaxation of a single spherical particle = u + 1 + i/ _ c with the characteristic frequency @xmath9 and dispersion strength @xmath10 : _ c & = & _ i + 2_e _ i + 2_e , + & = & _ i - _ e _ i + 2_e - _ i - _ e _ i + 2_e .",

    "( [ dispersion ] ) : the first term ( i.e. when @xmath27 ) is due to the phase difference between the cell and the medium , and the second term ( i.e. when @xmath28 ) is due to the presence of the intrinsic dispersion inside the cell .",
    "this is a special case of the model mentioned in the following section .",
    "it is interesting to compare that this model , with no shell , but the same core as the next model , has two dispersion strengths ( and the same number of characteristic frequencies ) , while the next model , with shell , has three dispersion strengths ( and the same number of characteristic frequencies ) .",

    "the cm ( clausius - mossotti ) factor of an isotropic model with a non - dispersive homogeneous core has been investigated  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to establish the ddsr ( dielectric dispersion spectral representation ) of an isotropic model with a _ dispersive _ homogeneous core covered with a non - dispersive , insulating membrane  @xcite .",
    "the idea of ddsr is to mathematically extract the analytic expressions of the dispersion strengths and the corresponding characteristic frequencies from the cm factor .",
    "the cm factor for a single - shell spherical cell with isotropic , lossless dielectric membrane is  @xcite [ u_iso ] u_iso = , where @xmath29 is permittivity and @xmath25 the radius ; the subscripts @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the external medium , the membrane and the cytosol respectively .",

    "the complex @xmath34 contains the dispersive term ( @xmath35 ) to account for the intrinsic dispersive nature of the cytosol , while both the membrane and the external medium are non - dispersive .",

    "each time only one parameter is varied , while the rest are kept at the values in table  [ values ] .",
    "these variations show interesting behaviours .    as shown in the figures ,",
    "there are three sub - dispersions : @xmath41 being the co - field peak related to the cytosol , @xmath43 being the anti - field peak related to the membrane and @xmath44 being the anti - field peak related to the intrinsic dispersion of the cytosol .    in fig .  1",
    ", the high - frequency co - field dispersion strength @xmath41 remains relatively constant from @xmath45s / m to about @xmath46s / m and then decreases with increasing @xmath8 , due to a significant reduction in the conductivity contrast between the cytosol and the external medium .",
    "its corresponding characteristic frequency @xmath47 also remains relatively constant in the mentioned range and then increases with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the anti - field dispersion strengths @xmath43 and @xmath44 and their corresponding characteristic frequencies @xmath48 and @xmath49 show more interesting behaviours . @xmath43 and @xmath44 swap at between @xmath50s / m and @xmath51s / m , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 show level - repulsion , i.e. their values gain closer , being closest at the same value of @xmath8 as when the swapping occurs , and then their values move apart again .",

    "these interesting phenomena are evidences that both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are real ( as opposed to virtual solutions arising from inaccurate calculations ) and are common in varying many of the parameters , as shown below .    in fig .  2 ,",
    "increasing @xmath7 causes @xmath41 to increase from negative ( anti - field ) to positive ( co - field ) and then remain constant , @xmath43 to decrease to a constant value and @xmath44 to remain constant throughout .",
    "@xmath47 increases monotonically while @xmath48 and @xmath49 remains roughly constant .    in fig .  3",
    ", varying @xmath52 has negligible effect on @xmath41 and thus also @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not very much affected if not for the swapping occurring at about @xmath53rad / s .",
    "their corresponding characteristic frequencies also show level - repulsion , as in previous cases , with the closest point also at about @xmath53rad / s .    in fig .  4 , @xmath41 and @xmath44 ( and also",
    "their corresponding characteristic frequencies @xmath47 and @xmath49 ) show negligible variations .",
    "both @xmath43 and @xmath48 remain relatively constant before increasing .",
    "they being the only affected ones because they are , as well as the concerned parameter @xmath54 , related to the membrane .",
    "compared with the isotropic mobile charge model with a non - dispersive homogeneous core previously investigated , it is interesting that the variations of different permittivities and conductivities show remarkably similar results , with the most noticeable difference that the swapping and the level - repulsion did not occur in the previous model .",
    "5 shows the real and imaginary parts of the cm factor against the field frequency for several values of the medium conductivity , in an attempt to illustrate the results in fig .  1 .",
    "in this figure , two dispersions are observed .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .  1 , the third dispersion strength is small enough to be neglected , and hence the third dispersion in fig .",
    "5 can not be shown , as expected .",

    "after investigating models with homogeneous cores , it is natural for us to proceed to investigate models with non - homogeneous cores .",
    "here we choose to investigate a model that consists of a dispersive core with graded dielectric profile , and a non - dispersive membrane .",
    "we consider a graded permittivity profile _",
    "i(r ) = _ i + ar + o[a]^2 ,  0 r r_i , where @xmath56 is a gradient , which has the unit as permittivity per unit length .",
    "we start from eq.([u_iso ] ) and replace the cytosolic permittivity by an equivalent permittivity @xmath57  @xcite |_i(r ) = _ i + a r_i + o[a]^2 .",
    "[ ave ] as shown below , @xmath57 can formally be calculated using the small - gradient expansion of the differential effective dipole approximation ( deda )  @xcite .",
    "after the substitution , we can expand the cm factor using taylor s expansion , up to the second order : u(a)=u(0)+au(0)+o[a]^2 .",
    "the first term is the same as @xmath58 , while the second term is the correction due to the graded profile .",
    "we now extract the ddsr of the second term as usual , by replacing the permittivities by their complex counterparts as in eqs.([i])([e ] ) , using the following substitution x^ * =    using these substitutions , we can see that the dielectric profile is _",

    "although the denominator is a quartic equation , there are only two distinct solutions for the characteristic frequency .",
    "this is due to the differentiation performed in the taylor s expansion , causing each frequency to split into a repeated root",
    ".    by partial fraction @xmath60 takes the form _",

    "the results are shown in table  [ results ] .",
    "these are corrections to the calculations in the previous session due to a small gradient .",
    "the characteristic frequencies remain the same as in the previous isotropic electrostatic model ( except now each is a repeated root ) , while the dispersion strengths are smaller than those in the previous model by one to two order of magnitude .",
    "this shows that our small - gradient expansion is valid .",
    "here a few comments are in order . in view of our recent success in the ddsr of single - shell spherical cell model , we are prepared to illustrate the ddsr in various different situations .",
    "we would like to extend ddsr to cell suspensions of higher concentration . at a higher concentration",
    ", we expect mutual interactions among cells and the dielectric behaviors can change significantly .",
    "we may extend ddsr to polydisperse cells , because the cells may have different sizes and/or permittivities .",
    "the polydispersity can have nontrivial impact on their dielectric behaviors .",
    "eventually we have to overcome the analytic continuation , and analyze the dispersion spectrum of the full anisotropic mobile charge model and the graded cell model .    regarding the applicability of the clausius - mossotti approach",
    ", one can solve the electrostatic problem first , and then extend to complex permittivities accordingly , as pointed out by jones  @xcite . as a matter of fact , there are already theories of e.g. maxwell and wagner , and rayleigh for heterogeneous dielectrics  @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "it is of value to compare these theories with the present approach .    in the present paper",
    ", we have discussed isolated particles in the dilute limit .",
    "in fact , for higher volume fractions , we can use the effective - medium theories instead  @xcite , like maxwell - garnett approximation or effective medium approximation .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the cells under consideration exist in the form of a spherical shape . in this connection",
    ", we may include the shape effect as well .",
    "more precisely , we can extend the graded spheroidal cell model of huang _",

    "@xcite to include an intrinsic dispersion in the core .",
    "this is a nontrivial extension and we believe the non - spherical shape will have significant impact on the dispersion spectrum .",
    "we can consider the following agenda : ( 1 ) homogeneous spheroidal cell with intrinsic dispersion , without shell  @xcite ; ( 2 ) graded spheroidal cell with intrinsic dispersion , without shell .",
    "also , item  2 will be studied in the small - gradient expansion .    in view of the present interesting results ,",
    "the corresponding experiment is suggested to be done . in doing so , one may use coated colloids having a graded core .    in summary , we have considered a single - shell model with an inhomogeneous graded cytosol .",
    "realistic cells must be inhomogeneous due to the compartment in the interior of cells . in such a model",
