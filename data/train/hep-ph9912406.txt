    "the search for higgs bosons at future colliders has become the focus of extensive studies , because of its importance as a test of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the detection of the full spectrum of scalars seems necessary in order to determine the nature of the physics that lies beyond the _ standard model _ ( sm ) . among the extensions of the sm",
    ", supersymmetry has received increasing attention , not only because of its aesthetical properties as a field theory , but also because the naturalness problem of the sm can be alleviated within the so - called _ minimal supersymmetric standard model _ ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "the mssm contains two higgs doublets , whose physical spectrum includes a charged pair @xmath7 , two neutral cp - even scalars ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , and one pseudoscalar ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the mssm higgs sector is determined at tree - level by two parameters , which are nowadays chosen as the @xmath10 mass and @xmath11 ( the ratio of the vevs .",
    "of the two higgs doublets ) .",
    "this in turn fixes the values of the neutral higgs mixing angle @xmath12 and the remaining higgs masses , which obey the tree - level relations , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "however , these relations are substantially modified when the effect of radiative corrections is included  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it makes possible that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and for some regions of parameters @xmath18 could even reach a value of about 130  gev  @xcite .",
    "current lep2 limits on the higgs masses are of about 90  gev for the light scalar @xmath19 , and , depending on the value of @xmath11 , up to about 85  gev for @xmath10  @xcite",
    ". however lep2 will be able to cover the region up to @xmath20 gev  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was found that tevatron can be used to test a significant portion of parameter space through the reaction @xmath21",
    "@xcite , moreover the possibility to perform b - tagging with a high efficiency has opened the window to detect the mode @xmath22 at lhc  @xcite and it will allow to test the large @xmath11 region of parameters at tevatron  @xcite . on the other hand , it has been shown  @xcite that lep2 plus lhc results will be able to cover almost all the mssm higgs sector parameter space , and through a combination of the reactions @xmath23 , @xmath24  @xcite and weak boson fusion  @xcite , the full region will be covered . at future linear colliders like nlc  @xcite , tesla  @xcite or jlc  @xcite , it will be possible to search for neutral and charged higgs bosons , through the production reactions @xmath25  @xcite and @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the future linear colliders can also operate in the @xmath27 mode  @xcite ; in this case the production of the sm higgs boson has been studied through the @xmath28 mechanism  @xcite , and also with the full 1-loop two - body reaction @xmath29  .",
    "the production of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath10 through the reaction @xmath30 has been studied too  @xcite , using the photon pole approximation . even though",
    ", these reactions can occur at tree - level , they receive the main contributions at one - loop level where the heavy particles of the model play an important role . these processes could be used to measure the couplings : @xmath31 , @xmath32  @xcite , which constitute important one - loop predictions of the theory , and are also sensitive to the effects of new physics .",
    "moreover , because of the possibility to measure the electron momenta , this reaction offers the possibility to determine the higgs mass with high precision .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the production of the neutral and charged higgs of the mssm at @xmath33 colliders through the reactions @xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 , at the one - loop level .",
    "our goal is to determine the regions of parameter space where a signal is detectable , and also to find out where it will be possible to distinguish between the mssm and sm higgs signals .",
    "we shall assume that the super - partners are heavy , and thus decouple from the amplitudes  @xcite , however the effect of squarks will be included in the higgs effective potential using the approximations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section 2 discusses the production of neutral higgs bosons .",
    "it includes a discussion of the region of parameter space that can be excluded , and also on the determination of the higgs mass .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the production of the charged higgs , whereas the conclusions of our work are presented in section 4 .",
    "details about the non - linear gauge used in the evaluation of the 1-loop amplitudes as well as the explicit formulae for the various amplitudes are presented in the appendices .",
    "we now proceed to present the results of our calculation of the amplitudes of the reactions : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes any of @xmath38 , and we have also displayed the notation for incoming and outgoing momenta .",
    "we have organized the calculation according to the @xmath39 gauge invariance , thus the diagrams are grouped as follows :    1 .",
    "three - point diagrams characterized by the @xmath31 and by the @xmath32 coupling ( fig .",
    "1-a ) ; 2 .   z and w - mediate box diagram and its related triangle graphs ( fig .",
    "1-b , c , d ) ,    the triangle graphs related to the @xmath40- and @xmath41-mediated box diagrams are the one - loop @xmath42 3-point functions .",
    "these groups of diagrams are finite and gauge invariant by themselves .",
    "the group ( 1 ) receives contributions from loops of charged fermions , @xmath41 gauge boson , and charged higgs boson @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "the group ( 2 ) is sensitive to the @xmath44 and @xmath45 vertices , respectively . for @xmath10",
    "there are contributions from fermionic triangles only , thus only group ( 1 ) appear .    in the linear gauge , the reaction @xmath3 receives also contributions coming from the reducible diagrams with the @xmath46 self - energy , which is an extra complication because one needs to perform a renormalization of this term .",
    "however , in the nonlinear gauge this term is absent as consequence of the explicit @xmath39 gauge symmetry in the w , goldstone and ghost sectors .",
    "notice that there are no contributions coming from the charged higgs boson to the group ( 2 ) .",
    "this happens because we use the approximation @xmath47 and also because there is no @xmath48 vertex at tree - level . and @xmath49 self - energies ( with the virtual fields tied to the electronic line ) .",
    "however , it can be shown that these terms always vanish . ]",
    "the mandelstam variables used in this calculation are defined by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",

    "@xcite , one should use , instead of the photon distribution , an exactly monochromatic initial photon beam which can help in distinguish the phisical effects related to the particular collision process from details depending on the final realization of the laser beam .    to evaluate the cross - section for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we have taken @xmath108 gev , and the values for the electroweak parameters given in the table of particle properties  @xcite . in fact , as it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions of the boxes can be neglected .",
    "the cross section for @xmath8 is about 4.2 fb for @xmath109 gev and @xmath110 gev , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 . with the expected luminosity at the future linear colliders  @xcite of about 50 fb@xmath111/yr",
    ", it will be possible to observe up to about 210 @xmath112 events , which should allow to study the properties of the higgs boson . among them",
    ", it will be interesting to test its spin and cp - even nature by studying the angular distributions , however this aspect is beyond the goal of the present work , where we are mainly interested in determining if the mssm higgs sector can be tested at electron - photon colliders .",
    "total cross - sections for the production of the heavy higgs boson @xmath9 as a function of the pseudoscalar mass @xmath113 and for different values of @xmath11 are shown in fig .",

    "the amplitude for the production of the pseudoscalar contains only contributions from the fermionic triangles .",

    "13 - 15 ) .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "4 , where we plot again the total cross - section as a function of the pseudoscalar mass ( @xmath113 ) , for several values of @xmath11 and for c.m . energy of 500 gev .",
    "it can be noted that the cross - section for @xmath10 is smaller than the one resulting for @xmath120 .",
    "thus , in this case it will be more difficult to detect the signal .",
    "the final signature for the reaction @xmath3 depends on the decay of the higgs boson . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the dominant mode is into @xmath121 , whereas for @xmath9 and @xmath10 this decay can also be relevant for some regions of parameter space . to evaluate the b.r . of the higgs bosons we shall assume that the decays into susy modes ( i.e. charginos , neutralinos , sfermions ) are not allowed and take the relevant equation for the decay widths from  @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with the ones obtained in the literature , for instance in ref .",
    "thus , we shall concentrate on the signature coming from the decay @xmath122 . in this case",
    "the main background comes from @xmath123 , which receives contribution from 8 graphs at tree level ; we have evaluated numerically this processes using comphep  @xcite .",
    "following dicus et al .",
    "@xcite , we have also imposed a cut on the angular distribution of the outgoing electron ( @xmath124 , relative to the incident photon ) that reduces significantly the background , while retaining most of the signal rate . to determine the region of parameter space , which is taken as the plane @xmath11-@xmath113 , where the higgs signal is detectable ,",
    "we have proceeded as follows : for each value of @xmath113 we evaluate the higgs masses and the cross - sections , then we find the value for @xmath11 where the cross - section of the signal is above the background at the 3 and @xmath125 level .    in fig .",
    "5 , we show the regions in the plane @xmath11-@xmath113 where the cross - section coming from @xmath8 has detectable values .",
    "the region to the right from the heavy line is where the signal is detectable , above backgrounds at the 3@xmath126 level .",
    "the dashed line denotes the contour at the 5@xmath126 level .",
    "it can be seen that the signal is above the backgrounds for a significant region of parameter space .    on the other hand ,",
    "6 shows the region where the cross - section from @xmath9 reaches detectable values .",
    "again , the region to the left from the heavy ( dashed ) line is where the signal is detectable at the 3 ( 5 ) @xmath126 level .",
    "it can be noticed that this region covers the sector of parameter space where it is more difficult to detect the light @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the cross - sections for @xmath127 and @xmath128 play a complementary role in providing a detectable signal for the full parameter space .",
    "moreover , we also notice from the superposition of figs . 5 and 6 , that there is a small region where",
    "the two higgs boson signals can be detected , which will allow to distinguish clearly between the mssm and the sm higgs sectors .",
    "finally , we also want to stress the fact that this reaction offers a unique opportunity to obtain a clean measurement of the higgs mass , thanks to the possibility to measure the outgoing electron momentum .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is related to the maximal energy of the electron as : @xmath129 thus , the precision attained for the electron energy will translate into a good determination of the higgs mass .    on the other hand , the largest values of the cross - section for @xmath10",
    "are obtained for large values of @xmath11 ( which is usually assumed to be at most of order 50 ) ; however , we find that even in this case the resulting cross - section does not seem to give a detectable signal .",
    "moreover , for large values of @xmath11 there appears a mass - degeneracy between @xmath10 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 , which will make difficult to distinguish the individual signals . in this case",
    ", it will be neccesary to optimize the cuts to be able to detect the pseudoscalar @xmath10 , and to separate it from the largest signals coming from @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "otherwise , one would have to add the respective signals ; for instance , one could imposed the criteria that whenever the difference between the higgs masses is less than 5 gev ( a conservative criteria given the possibility to obtain a precise measurement of the higgs mass ) , the individual contributions to the signal must be combined .",
    "we find that this only helps to enlarge the exclusion contours for @xmath11 above 30 .",
    "another option to detect @xmath10 ( and a heavy @xmath9 too ) is to use the planned second and third stages of the future e - gamma colliders  @xcite , which could reach an energy of 1 tev and 2 tev , with integrated luminosities that could reach 125 and 500 @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "now , turning to the production of the charged higgs , we observe that it can also proceed through the 1-loop reaction : @xmath131    the diagrams encountered in the calculation of the @xmath132 are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrch ] .",
    "they include : triangle graphs with bosons and fermions in the loop ( fig .",
    "[ diagrch]a ) , seagull - type graphs with bosonic contributions ( fig .",
    "[ diagrch]b - c ) , and finally those with self - energy insertions  ( fig .",
    "[ diagrch]d , [ diagrch]e , [ diagrch]f ) .",
    "[ diagrch]f gives a vanishing contribution for massless external fermions .",
    "our result for the total amplitude is written as :    @xmath133\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 denote the contribution from the different sets of graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrch ] and are given in the appendix c.    fig .",
    "[ plotchsig ] shows the cross - section for our process for several values of @xmath11 (= 1.5 , 5 , 10 ) .",
    "the cross section is small , about 0.5 fb for @xmath138 gev and @xmath139 gev , which can give 25 events with an expected future linear colliders luminosities of 50  fb@xmath111/yr . in fig .",
    "[ plotchall ] we compare the cross section from @xmath140 , with the pair production @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the production mechanisms @xmath141 , @xmath143 , have been discussed in the literature@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the reaction @xmath142 is evaluated using the williams - weizsacker approximation ( for the second photon ) and we use the sub - reaction @xmath143 . it can be seen that the single production dominates only for large higgs masses i.e. for values that lay beyond the threshold for pair production .      in this paper",
    "we only show ( fig .",
    "[ plotchsig ] ) the results for fixed values of @xmath144 , and as can be appreciated it turns out that the resulting cross - section has smaller results , which hardly seem detectable . in order to determine",
    "if the signal is detectable , one needs to consider the potential backgrounds , which depend on the higgs mass , since this determines the decay signatures .",
    "for instance , if @xmath145 , the dominant decay mode is @xmath146 which reaches a branching ratio of order 1 for most values of @xmath147 . in this case",
    "the background will come from the production @xmath148 , which for masses @xmath149 will be much larger than the signal ( it reaches @xmath150 ) and probably will not allow detection .",
    "for masses somehow larger , both the signal and the background will be more suppressed and the question of detectability will depend on the experimental ability to identify the decay mode and to reconstruct the charged higgs mass .    for heavier higgs masses , @xmath151 ,",
    "the dominant higgs decay is into @xmath152 , and in this case one needs to compare the signal with the background arising from single top production , @xmath153 for @xmath151 , which according to the results of boos et al .",
    "@xcite , has @xmath154 for @xmath155 gev and @xmath156gev .",
    "thus we can see that at the level of total cross - section the background is again larger than the signal .",
    "however if one makes a cut in the invariant mass of the @xmath157 system , then it will be possible to reduce the background .",
    "we have studied the production of the neutral cp - even and charged higgs boson of the mssm ( @xmath158 ) at future @xmath159 colliders , through the reactions @xmath160 .",
    "the amplitudes are evaluated using a non - linear @xmath2-gauge , which greatly simplifies the calculation .",
    "the resulting cross section indicates that it is possible to detect the light neutral higgs boson ( @xmath8 ) for most values of parameters . on the other hand , detection of the heavy neutral higgs bosons @xmath9 seems possible only for light values of @xmath113 .",
    "we have determined the regions in the plane @xmath11-@xmath113 where the signal is above the backgrounds .",
    "the cross - sections for @xmath8 and @xmath9 play a complementary role , since the region where @xmath9 reaches detectable values occurs precisely in the region where it is more difficult to detect the light @xmath8 .",
    "thus , both reactions allow to cover the full plane @xmath161 with at least one detectable signal .",
    "however , it is found that the possibility to distinguish the mssm from the sm case , through detection of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 signals , occurs only for a limited region of parameter space .    on the other hand ,",
    "the results for the pseudoscalar and the charged higgs boson have smaller values of the cross - section , which seems difficult to detect .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from conacyt and sni ( mxico ) .",
    "u.c . whish to acknowledge useful discussions with borut bajc and goran senjanovi .",
    "in the evaluation of the above processes , we have used a feynman - thooft version of the nonlinear gauge   that greatly simplify the calculation . in order to appreciate the advantages that offer a nonlinear gauge , we find convenient to compare it with the conventional linear gauge for the sm .",
    "it is well known that in a linear gauge only the charged fermion sector presents explicit electromagnetic gauge symmetry ( @xmath39 ) , since the gauge fixing procedure used for the su(2 ) sector destroys manifest @xmath39 symmetry in the charged gauge boson ( @xmath162 ) and ghosts sectors ( @xmath163 ) , when they are considered separately , because the gauge functional used to define the @xmath41-propagator does not transform covariantly under the @xmath39 symmetry .",
    "it follows that instead of obeying naive ward identities , these sectors are related through ward - slavnov identities . in order to obtain a finite and @xmath39-invariant result for higher - order ( loop ) calculations",
    ", one must sum over the contributions arising from the @xmath41 gauge boson , the charged ghosts , and the @xmath164 combined effects , @xmath165 denotes the would - be goldstone boson . on the other hand ,",
    "the functional used to define the @xmath41-propagator in the non - linear gauge contains the electromagnetic covariant derivative .",
    "thus , the @xmath39 symmetry is respected by each charged sector of the sm .",
    "it follows that a finite and @xmath39 gauge invariant result is obtained for each type of diagram containing a given kind of charged particles .",
    "moreover , the number of diagrams involved is considerably reduced because there are no @xmath164 combined effects . in the sm ,",
    "the functionals that define the @xmath41 , @xmath40 , and @xmath55 propagators are given by : @xmath166 where @xmath167 , with @xmath168 , @xmath169 is the neutral would - be goldstone .",
    "@xmath170 is the gauge parameter , which in general is different for each of the three gauge bosons .",
    "however , in the non - linear feynman - thooft version of this gauge , one takes @xmath171 for all sectors .",
    "the gauge fixing lagrangian is given by : @xmath172 which in turn removes the @xmath173 and @xmath174 vertices from the higgs kinetic energy term .",
    "notice that the @xmath175 term is @xmath39 gauge invariant , which implies that the fadeev - popov @xmath176 lagrangian is also @xmath39-invariant .",
    "it is also possible to proceed further with this scheme and remove more un - physical vertices , such as @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "this procedure requires to define the functionals @xmath179 nonlinearly both in the vector and scalar parts .",
    "however , for the present purposes it is sufficient to use the scheme presented above .    in this case",
    "only the couplings in the gauge and ghost sectors are modified .",
    "we shall give the lagrangian for these sectors in a form that clarifies the role of the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",

    "<S> a complete study for the production of neutral ( @xmath0 ) and charged higgs ( @xmath1 ) bosons at electron - photon colliders is presented in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model . a particular choice of the non - linear @xmath2-gauge </S>",
    "<S> is used to evaluate the amplitudes of the reaction @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cross section indicates that it will be possible to detect a signal from the neutral higgs bosons for most regions of parameter space at the future linear colliders with @xmath4 gev through the reaction @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this reaction also offers the interesting possibility to measure the higgs mass through the detection of the outgoing electron . the production of the charged higgs boson ( @xmath5 ) through the reaction @xmath6 has in general smaller values for the cross section , which seems more difficult to observe . </S>"
