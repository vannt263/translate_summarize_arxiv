    "the bright - x - ray luminosities in the order of 10@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 and higher - accreting black hole and neutron star x - ray binary systems are amongst the best studied galactic x - ray sources . many of these show a rich phenomenology , displaying spectral state changes , dramatic accretion outbursts and complex temporal behaviour on a wide range of temporal and spectral scales .",
    "however , an interesting sub - class of x - ray sources exists that are _ persistent _ in their x - ray behaviour , but have low x - ray luminosities .",
    "the monitoring program of the galactic bulge source population with the _ rxte _ satellite through pca scans started in 1999 and has revealed many new bright x - ray transients .",
    "it also detected a large number of these faint , persistent sources , for which relatively little is known .",
    "we have undertaken a small survey using _ chandra _  and the eso 3.6 m telescope to accurately localize a sample of 20 of these _ rxte _ faint persistent x - ray source sources , and determine their nature : this class of sources is thought to harbour a wide variety of exotic types of systems ( e.g. the class of the very short binary period sources - ultracompact x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the main results of this survey will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( wiersema et al in prep ; hereafter w09 ) .",
    "one of the sources of this survey was sax j1712.6 - 3739 , a candidate ultra - compact x - ray binary ( ucxb ; @xcite ) . in the case of a ucxb",
    "the mass accretion rate or luminosity may be a good indicator for the mass transfer rate from the donor star , and such low accretion rates suggest the possibility of degenerate donors such a white dwarfs , making ucxbs important sources to study from a binary evolution point of view . however , their ( optical ) faintness makes ucxbs particularly hard to find and unambiguously identify ( see for example @xcite ) .    at optical wavelenghts ,",
    "several components contribute to the light received from a lmxb , e.g. the accretion disk , the secondary star and a possible jet component . to broadly separate these various contributions and eliminate other , perhaps less likely , possible source identifications ( e.g. accreting white dwarfs , high mass x - ray binaries ; see w09 for statistics from our survey ) , we observed the sources in the survey of w09 in four optical bands .    in our narrowband h@xmath0  imaging of sax j1712.6 - 3739 , we discover a large , bright , roughly bow shock - shaped nebulosity , with an origin consistent with the position of the _ chandra _  counterpart of sax j1712.6 - 3739 , and unlike any other previously discovered nebulosity associated with an x - ray binary . the importance of this discovery is clear : the production of the h@xmath0  nebula in sax j1712.6 - 3739  is undoubtedly related to the accretion produced photon flux or the mechanical work of an accretion - associated jet slamming into the ism ( and the kinetic energy of the binary ) , and in both cases the morphology and flux of the nebulosity can be used to constrain the current and past energy output of this candidate neutron star ucxb .",
    "as part of the survey described in w09 we observed the _ bepposax _ position of sax j1712.6 - 3739   with the high resolution camera ( hrc - i ) onboard _ chandra _ , on 2007 october 23 , with an effective on - source exposure time of 1.176 ks .",
    "the data were processed using the ciao tools ( version 4.0 ) and standard _ chandra _  analysis threads . using the _ wavdetect _ routine , a bright point source is found with count rate 5.16 counts s@xmath2 , at position",
    "ra : 258.15319 degrees , dec : -37.64473 degrees ( j2000 ) , with an astrometric uncertainty of 0.6 arcseconds ( 90% containment , including systematics ) .",
    "this position is within the errorcircle of the _ rosat _ position of sax j1712.6 - 3739 , the best previous position of this source .",
    "based on position and observed count rate we conclude that the _ chandra _  source can be identified with sax j1712.6 - 3739 .",
    "we find that the _ xmm - newton _",
    "slew survey @xcite lists a bright source consistent with the _ chandra _  position : xmmsl1 j171236.3 - 373841 .",
    "the source is detected in two slews : the first during 2006 march 8 and the second during 2008 february 27 , at position ra : 258.15194 degrees , dec : -37.644827 degrees ( j2000 ; @xmath3 error ) .",

    "pca observations at similar times also show a count rate difference of a factor @xmath5 ( figure [ fig : pcalc ] ) , strengthening the identification of the _ xmm - newton _  source with the pca source even more .",
    "@xcite use the _ bepposax _ data to find @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we extract spectra from the _ xmm - newton _  slew data , and fit them with an absorbed powerlaw , where we fix @xmath8 in order to get a good estimate of the absorption , needed to interpret the optical data ( see section [ sec : lmxb ] ) , as there are not sufficient counts to fit for both parameters .",
    "we find @xmath9 ( 90% ) for slew 1 , and @xmath10 ( 90% ) for slew 2 .",

    "this configuration gives a field of view of @xmath11 , with a pixel scale of 0.31 \" per pixel on sky ( @xmath12 binning ) .",
    "data were taken on 2007 july 1 , in the following filters : bessel v ( eso filter # 641 ; total exposure time 10 minutes ) , bessel r ( # 642 ; 10 minutes ) , gunn i ( # 705 ; 10 minutes ) and narrowband h@xmath0  ( # 692 , 15 minutes ) .",

    "all data were overscan corrected , trimmed , flatfielded and cosmic ray cleaned with the usual procedures , using tasks in iraf .",
    "data were taken close to the moon , giving rather high sky background , resulting in somewhat lower limiting magnitudes for these bands than can be expected under the seeing and airmass conditions given in table [ table : opticallog ] .",
    "wcs calibration of the optical frames is carried out by matching sources in the frames to usno - b2 source lists . the resulting wcs solutions ( rms 0.3@xmath13 )",
    "were subsequently refined using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) sources detected in the field . resulting rms values of the best astrometric fit for each filter are 0.13@xmath13 for the r and i band frames ( using 590 2mass stars ) , and 0.16@xmath13 for the v and h@xmath0  frames ( 400 stars ) .    as this field is in the galactic plane ( latitude @xmath14 degrees )",
    "the field is crowded , particularly in i and r band .",
    "we therefore used iraf daophot tasks to perform iterative point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry : after detecting a bright sample of stars with daofind , we fit a first order spatially variable empirical psf to bright stars ( using several iterations to subtract off neighbour stars , refine psf star selection and use progressively larger fit radii ) .",
    "after psf photometry using allstar we subtract this list of stars and iterate with a lower detection threshold .",
    "efosc2 is a focal reducer instrument , and as such suffers from a small amount of vignetting , and the psf for sources near the chip edges is distorted .",
    "the position of the optical counterpart of sax j1712.6 - 3739   is sufficiently away from the chip edges that this does not affect our results ( see figure [ fig : nebulasax ] ) .    to derive approximate magnitudes , we use efosc2 zeropoints and la silla average atmospheric extinction terms from the efosc2 quality control webpages , calibrating the gunn i band data to i. all magnitudes",

    "while the absolute photometry is likely not highly accurate , the differential colours of objects in the field should be reasonably reliable , allowing a classification of sources .",

    "the efosc2 h@xmath0   data shows patchy nebulosity , which is confirmed through much larger field of view h@xmath0  data retrieved from the supercosmos repository ( @xcite ) : the x - ray source is located in an area abundant in bright diffuse clouds of gas . in the efosc2 data a bright nebular source is obvious , which appears distinctly jet or bow shock shaped and spans most of the h@xmath0  image ( see figure [ fig : nebulasax ] ) .",

    "@xcite suggest from a literature data compilation that this source is a candidate ucxb .",
    "they derive a reddening by using the @xcite relation between galactic @xmath19 and @xmath20 , using @xmath21 @xmath22 ( @xcite and @xcite , a value roughly consistent with our estimate , see section [ sec : xray_obs ] ) and find @xmath23 . in combination with the distance of @xmath24 kpc ( section [ sec : lmxb ] ) , @xcite predict a visual magnitude of @xmath25 for a ucxb and @xmath26 if the source is a non - ultracompact binary .",
    "sources s1 and s2 have v magnitudes ( or limit in the case of s2 ) in between these two values , see table [ table : results ] , but obviously this is rather dependent on the uncertain extinction towards this source . using this same extinction estimate and distance",
    "we find @xmath27 for s1 . while this is faint , it is somewhat brighter than the absolute magnitudes of ucxb candidates , and comparable to standard short period lmxb values ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) , though we note the uncertain optical extinction .",
    "time resolved optical spectroscopy of this system would be able to reveal the binary period and therefore the ucxb nature .",
    "the _ chandra _  position coincides with the position from which the jet- or bow shock shaped nebula visible in h@xmath0   appears to originate , see figure [ fig : nebulasax ] , strengthening a connection between this object and the nebulosity .",
    "specifically , an extension of the two approximately straight band / stripes of h@xmath0  emission meet near the location of the lmxb .",
    "the probability of chance coincidence of a lmxb with an , unassociated , bow shock shaped nebula can however not be robustly calculated , as it would require searching h@xmath0  surveys for similar features _",
    "unrelated _ to lmxbs , while the definition of `` similar '' is necessarily influenced by the detection of this current , unique , source .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that a theoretical model predicting a system similar to this observed one ( @xcite ) has been made _ prior _ to our discovery of this system .",
    "we may expect the lmxb to move roughly with the galactic plane , as a large kick is required to make it move away from the plane .",
    "the projected direction of motion of the lmxb inferred from the bow shock shape is towards the galactic plane , i.e. moving towards lower galactic latitude , consistent with this picture .    in the following we continue on the premise that the nebula is indeed produced by the lmxb , and discuss the two most likely mechanisms to produce this nebula , discussing also",
    "which future observations may help distinguish these models .",
    "the nebula seems to exist of two nearly parallel trails of h@xmath0  emission that appear to originate close to the lmxb , and a diffuse , near - semicircular region of emission just ` in front ' ( to the south - east ) of sax j1712.6 - 3739 .",
    "the distance from the lmxb to the leading edge of this diffuse region is @xmath28 , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath29 cm ( adopting @xmath30 kpc ) .",
    "the trails appear to fade and widen with distance from the lmxb except initially ; the maximum surface brightness of the trails is located at a distance @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the lmxb for the northern and southern trails , respectively .",
    "the width of each trail is @xmath33 close to the lmxb , widening to @xmath34 at a distance of @xmath35 , for the northern trail .",
    "accretion is on almost all masses and timescales observed to relate to the formation of high velocity jets , from the extremely energetic gamma - ray bursts to the more sedate outflows of young stellar objects .",
    "evidence for jets in x - ray binaries is found from direct detection of fast moving radio or x - ray emission from the jets themselves or shocks downstream ( e.g. @xcite ) , from transient ( unresolved ) radio emission ( @xcite ) , from spectral / polarimetric / timing studies in the infrared and optical ( e.g. @xcite ) or in one case from doppler - shifted emission lines from baryonic jets ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , bow shock nebulae powered by the jets of cyg x1 and lmc x1 have been identified , and their properties have been used to infer the time - averaged power of the jets ( @xcite ) . since sax j1712.6 - 3739  has a hard spectrum and a steady luminosity we may assume it to have compact jets , detectable at radio frequencies , with typical flux densities @xmath36 mjy ( @xcite ) , unfortunately fainter than the limit of the nvss survey locally .",
    "judging by the density of h@xmath0  clouds in the field ( from the supercosmos data ) , this source is situated in a dense interstellar medium .",
    "the long term interaction of a jet from a lmxb with a dense medium coupled with a high space velocity may give rise to bow shock - shaped trails of collisionally excited gas ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "the requirement of a high space velocity means that lmxbs should more easily form jet trails than hmxbs .",
    "however , sources with a morphology like this have not been observed to date , probably because for most lmxbs the local ism density is not high enough ( @xcite ) .",
    "the heinz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) model predicts a morphology and size remarkably similar to the observed h@xmath0  nebula ( figure [ fig : nebulasax ] ) which would make sax j1712.6 - 3739  the first confirmed jet trail source . in this scenario ,",
    "we interpret the nebula as an edge - brightened cone - shaped bow shock ( a ` head - tail source ' , like those seen associated with agn ) powered by two continuously replenished jets .",
    "the space velocity of the lmxb would exceed the velocity of the bow shock , forming trails behind the lmxb as opposed to shell - like stationary cocoons like the one of cyg x1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emission region ` in front ' of the lmxb is expected in this scenario , ionized by the approaching radiation field .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission originates in this case from recombination of the shock - compressed gas near the shock front .",
    "radio plasma consisting of relativistic particles and magnetic fields should fill the region behind the bow shock front ",
    "these trails may be detectable , as might radio - emitting bremsstrahlung radiation from the shell .",
    "the detection of such structures will confirm the jet - powered nature of the nebula .",
    "when interpreting the nebula as a jet blown trail , the width of the trail provides important constraints on the system .",
    "in particular , using equation 12 from @xcite we find that the average jet power @xmath37 is likely well below 10@xmath38 erg s@xmath2 , not unexpected for a neutron star lmxb ( though note that prototypical neutron star jet source cir x-1 has a jet power close to 10@xmath38 erg s@xmath2 ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the persistently active , neutron star ucxb 4u 0614 + 09 has been shown to produce powerful jets ( @xcite ) with jet power @xmath39 erg s@xmath2 , dominating the radio to nir emission from the system ( @xcite , migliari et al in prep ) .",
    "the jet powered scenario is therefore not unexpected .",
    "h@xmath0  bow shocks with broadly similar morphology are occasionally found around fast moving isolated neutron stars , though much fainter and smaller than this source ( e.g. @xcite ) , powered by pulsar winds .",
    "accretion inhibits strong pulsar winds in lmxbs but instead , accretion disc winds powered by irradiation on the disc could be powerful .",
    "however , disc winds are likely to be orders of magnitude weaker than the jets ( see the case of 4u 0614 + 09 above ) , making it much more likely that the trails are powered by jets than by a disc wind .",
    "since sax j1712.6 - 3739  is a persistent x - ray source , local nebulosity will be photo - ionized by its x - ray and uv radiation field .",
    "the nebula surrounding lmc x1 is partly ionized in this fashion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the morphology of the sax j1712.6 - 3739  nebula may be consistent with this interpretation if the lmxb has a high space velocity .",
    "however , the observed edge brightened morphology is hard to achieve in this scenario , while expected in the jet trail model .",
    "furthermore we would need either a definite density gradient along the binary trajectory or a declining ionizing photon flux as a function of time to create the observed nebula morphology .",
    "emission line ratios are commonly used as diagnostics of shock - ionized or photo - ionized gas ( e.g. @xcite ) ; for example the [ sii ] / h@xmath0  line ratio is an indicator of shocked gas and the heii / h@xmath0  ratio of photo - ionized gas .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy ( or narrow - band imaging ) of the trails will therefore constrain the nature of the nebula and probe the velocity , density and composition of the gas , constraining either the time - averaged power of the jets or the soft x - ray / euv radiation field of the lmxb .",
    "note that in both models discussed above the requirement of a high space velocity suggests a relatively high proper motion , which may be detectable with future instrumentation .",
    "in a survey of faint persistent x - ray sources with _",
    "chandra _  and efosc2 on the eso 3.6 m telescope , we find an accurate x - ray position of the neutron star low mass x - ray binary sax j1712.6 - 3739 and identify its most likely optical counterpart : a faint source with blue colours with respect to field stars . using the best known extinction and distance estimates , we find that a ucxb nature of sax j1712.6 - 3739   can be accomodated by the measured magnitudes . in the h@xmath0  data",
    "we serendipitously detect a large nebula with a distinct bow shock shape , likely associated with the lmxb .",
    "the nebula is likely formed through either the interaction of a energetic jet from the lmxb with the interstellar medium , or through intense uv / x - ray radiation . in both cases",
