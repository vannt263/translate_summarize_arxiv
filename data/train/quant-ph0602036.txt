    "<S> states of optical fields are important resources for photonic quantum information technology particularly with continuous variables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of such protocols is limited directly by the squeezing level @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the amount of information extracted by quantum dense coding must increase as @xmath5 ,   \\label{eq - i}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the average photon number used for signal modulation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the highest squeezing level observed so far under practical setting with the phase locked was @xmath7 db by polzik _ </S>",

    "<S> they employed a continuous - wave ( cw ) ti : sapphire laser at 852 nm and a sub - threshold degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) with a knbo@xmath8 crystal as a nonlinear optical medium . since then this scheme has been a sort of standard in squeezing experiments at this wavelength range .    </S>",
    "<S> for knbo@xmath8 , however , the pump ( blue ) light induced infrared absorption ( bliira ) has been known as the limiting factor for attaining higher squeezing . a break - through </S>",
    "<S> was brought by aoki _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath1 ( ppktp ) . </S>",
    "<S> although existences of the pump light induced absorption in ktiopo@xmath1 ( ktp ) and ppktp crystals had already been reported in pulsed light experiments @xcite , bliira was not observed at 946 nm in their cw experiment @xcite .    in this letter , we report the higher level of squeezing , @xmath0 db , generated with ppktp at 860 nm in cw experiment with the phase locked . </S>",
    "<S> this squeezing level opens potential applications to new coding in a single mode bosonic channel and sensing technologies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , it is expected to beat the holevo capacity limit if the state purity is improved by reducing the present anti - squeezing level because the squeezing level itself already exceeds the theoretical criterion of @xmath9 db @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the size and performance of photonic quantum circuit will also be improved . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the quantum teleportation of coherent states , either five cascaded processes or a single process with a high fidelity of 0.84 could be performed in principle . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the wavelength range corresponds to the cs d@xmath10 line ( 852 nm ) , and hence fascinating for applications for controlling cs atoms with non - classical light .        </S>",
    "<S> a schematic of our experimental apparatus is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> a continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser ( coherent mbr-110 ) at 860 nm is employed to accomplish this experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the beam from the ti : sapphire laser is phase - modulated at 15.3 mhz by an electro - optic modulator after passing an optical isolator . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation is utilized to lock a cavity for frequency doubling and a mode cleaning cavity with conventional fm - sideband locking technique @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a part of the beam of around 900 mw is introduced into the frequency doubler to generate second harmonic at 430 nm as a pump beam for an opo . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency doubler has a knbo@xmath8 crystal as a nonlinear optical medium in the external cavity with a bow - tie - type ring configuration . </S>",
    "<S> an output power from the doubler at 430 nm is more than 400 mw .    </S>",
    "<S> the opo consists of a bow - tie - type ring cavity and a ppktp crystal ( raicol crystals ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity has the folding angle of @xmath11 , two spherical mirrors ( radius of curvature : 50 mm ) , and two plain mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> one of the plain mirrors is a partial transmittance mirror and works as the output coupler while the others are high reflectance mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> the round - trip length of 500 mm , the distance between the two spherical mirrors of 58 mm , and the ppktp crystal ( 10 mm long ) placed between the spherical mirrors result in waist radii of 20 @xmath12 m inside the crystal and 200 @xmath12 m outside the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is mechanically stabilized by concatenating mirror mounts of the mirrors with aluminum plates . </S>",
    "<S> the opo easily oscillates with the pump power of 200 mw , while the oscillation threshold @xmath13 mw is theoretically obtained from a nonlinear coefficient of the crystal of @xmath14 , an intra - cavity loss @xmath15 , and a transmittance of the output coupler of @xmath16 with the formula @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the resonant frequency of the opo cavity is locked using a `` lock beam '' and a photo - detector ( pd2 ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - setup ] via the conventional fm - sideband locking technique @xcite . in order to avoid interference of the lock beam and a `` probe beam '' in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - setup ] , the beams are in opposite circulations of the cavity . despite the effort , </S>",
    "<S> a fraction of the lock beam circulates backward because of reflection from surfaces of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is solved by changing the transverse mode and the frequency of the lock beam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse mode is changed from tem@xmath18 to tem@xmath19 by inserting a glass plate into a spatial half part of the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency is shifted by about @xmath20 mhz with an acousto - optic modulator . </S>",
    "<S> thus the probe beam in tem@xmath18 mode and the lock beam in tem@xmath19 mode resonate simultaneously with the opo cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> the generated squeezed light is combined with a local oscillator ( lo ) at a 50:50 beam - splitter ( hbs ) and detected by a balanced homodyne detector ( hd ) with si photo - diodes ( hamamatsu s3590 - 06 with special anti - reflection coating ) . </S>",
    "<S> the circuit noise level of the homodyne detector at 1 mhz is @xmath21 db below the shot noise level with the lo of 3 mw . </S>",
    "<S> an output of the hd is measured for the sideband component at 1 mhz by a spectrum analyzer ( agilent e4402b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum analyzer is set to the zero - span mode at 1 mhz with 30 khz resolution bandwidth and 300 hz video bandwidth .        </S>",
    "<S> a relative phase between the lo and the squeezed light is locked by use of the probe beam . </S>",
    "<S> the probe is locked in phase so that it is minimized / maximized along with the parametric gain of the opo , and then works as a marker of the squeezed / anti - squeezed quadrature of the squeezed light . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - setup ] , it is modulated in phase at 64 khz by a piezo - electric transducer ( pzt4 ) , amplified or deamplified in the opo , and then detected the fraction of 1 % by a photo - detector ( pd4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase modulation at 64 khz is used for two controllers based on the fm - sideband locking technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an output signal of the pd4 is monitored by one of the controllers which locks the probe via controlling a piezo - electric transducer ( pzt5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , a relative phase between the probe and the lo is locked by the other controller which monitors an interference signal of these beams from the hd and controls another piezo - electric transducer ( pzt6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a fluctuation of the relative phase between the lo and squeezed light is estimated as @xmath22 , which is obtained via measuring rms values of error signals from the control circuits .    in order to improve the homodyne efficiency , </S>",
    "<S> the lo is spatially filtered by the mode cleaning cavity which yields the same spatial mode as the opo output . </S>",
    "<S> the overall detection efficiency @xmath23 after the opo is obtained from the propagation efficiency of the optical path of @xmath24 and the homodyne efficiency @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne efficiency is dominated by the visibility between the lo and the opo output mode because the quantum efficiency of the si photo - diodes could be treated as unity at the wavelength .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the alignment beam shown in fig . [ fig - setup ] is an auxiliary beam which is reserved for use in alignment of constructing the cavity , measuring the intra - cavity loss , and matching the spatial mode of the pump beam with the opo cavity . for the last application listed above </S>",
    "<S> , the alignment beam is converted to the second harmonic with the opo as a reference beam for the alignment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reference beam propagates in the opposite direction to the pump beam and represents the opo cavity mode . by matching the spatial mode of the reference beam with that of the pump beam , </S>",
    "<S> the pump beam is matched with the opo cavity mode . in order to attain it , a triangle cavity in the path of the pump beam </S>",
    "<S> is utilized @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> indicate measured values while @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicate theoretical ones which are calculated from measured classical parametric gains . </S>",
    "<S> the phase fluctuation of the lo is taken into account for the plots with @xmath27 while it is not done for those with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows purities calculated from the observed squeezing and anti - squeezing levels using the definition @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the density operator of the observed state.,width=321 ]    observed quantum noise levels of the opo output are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - nl - time ] . </S>",
    "<S> they were observed when the pump power was 100 mw . </S>",
    "<S> we succeeded in locking the lo phase at the squeezed and anti - squeezed quadratures and in obtaining @xmath0 db squeezing and @xmath30 db anti - squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing level of the generated state is estimated to be @xmath31 db by taking into account the effect of the circuit noise .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the intra - cavity loss @xmath15 of the opo stayed constant independently of the pump beam power , i.e. , bliira was not observed . </S>",
    "<S> considering the existence of the pump light induced infrared absorption in experiments with pulsed lasers @xcite , we infer that the absence of bliira in our experiment is due to the cw operation .    </S>",
    "<S> the pump power dependences of the squeezing and anti - squeezing levels are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - sq - blue ] . </S>",
    "<S> the observed squeezing level saturates while the pump power increases . </S>",
    "<S> this fact could be due to the fluctuation @xmath32 which had a large effect on the observed squeezing level through mixing of the highly anti - squeezed quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> taking account of @xmath32 , the theoretical squeezing level @xmath33 and anti - squeezing level @xmath34 are calculated as follows @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is modeled in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering @xmath37 , the theoretical results almost agree with the experimental ones as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - sq - blue ] . assuming @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> , the squeezing level would be @xmath39 db with 100 mw pumping .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we achieved @xmath0 db quadrature squeezing at 860 nm with the phase locked at the maximally squeezed quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , bliira was not observed in a ppktp crystal for the case of the cw pumped sub - threshold optical parametric oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting state is expected to be utilized to perform various kinds of quantum information processing , to implement precise measurements , and to investigate the photon - atom interactions with cs atoms .    </S>",
