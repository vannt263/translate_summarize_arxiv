    "the main question which motivated this work is the following : how do conformal field theories look like if studied from the point of view of a possibly existing _ integrable structure _ ?",
    "there are many quantum - field theoretical models of high interest for string theory and condensed matter physics which are expected to have conformal invariance , but not enough chiral symmetry to make a solution in terms of standard methods of conformal field theory look realistic .",
    "an interesting class of examples are nonlinear sigma models with targets being super - groups , which have recently attracted considerable interest both from string theory and condensed matter physics .",
    "some of these theories are expected to be integrable .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to expect that methods from the theory of integrable models can be used to understand the spectrum of these theories .",
    "such a program immediately faces an obstacle : up to now it seemed that key features of conformal field theories like the factorization into left- and right - moving degrees of freedom are very hard to see with the help of the integrable structure . using the traditional approaches based on the bethe ansatz one usually has to go a rather long way until some of the features of conformal invariance become visible .",
    "we therefore looked for a simple , but prototypical example where we can improve on this state of affairs .",
    "the main point we want to illustrate with the example of liouville theory is the following : the factorization into left- and right - movers can be made manifest in a very transparent way already on the level of an integrable lattice regularization of a conformal field theory .",
    "the framework in which this turns out to be the case combines the use of baxter s q - operators with the separation of variables technique of sklyanin @xcite . in the cases under consideration",
    "we will explicitly construct q - operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 which contain the conserved charges of left- and right - moving degrees of freedom , respectively . within the separation of variables",
    "framework one may then represent an eigenstate of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of a wave - function constructed directly out of the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". the combination of these two ingredients yields a quantum version of the bcklund transformation from liouville theory to free field theory , making the factorization into left- and right - moving degrees of freedom transparent .",
    "it also seems promising to view the integrable structure of conformal field theories as a useful starting point for the study of massive integrable models .",
    "one may expect that the integrable structure `` deforms smoothly '' from the massless to the massive cases , but is simpler to study in the massless limits .",
    "this point of view was developed in particular in the beautiful series of works @xcite , where conformal field theories with central charge @xmath4 were studied .",
    "one of our aims here is to study the counterpart of this theory for @xmath5 .",
    "the constructions from @xcite no longer work in this case due to more severe ultraviolet problems .",
    "we will use an integrable lattice regularization to control such problems .",
    "this will also allow us study the sinh - gordon model , liouville theory and quantum kdv theory in a uniform framework .",
    "we will observe that key objects of the integrable structure like the baxter q - operators are indeed related to each other by certain parametric limits .",
    "the example chosen , liouville theory , is of considerable interest in its own right .",
    "it has attracted a lot of attention for more than 25 years now due to its connections with noncritical string theory and two - dimensional quantum gravity ( see @xcite for reviews and references ) , as an example for interesting non - rational conformal field theories @xcite , and due to its relations to the ( quantized ) teichmller spaces of riemann surfaces @xcite .    in the study of liouville theory ,",
    "the most popular approach so far was based on its conformal symmetry , leading to a complete solution in the sense of the belavin - polyakov - zamolodchikov bootstrap approach @xcite , see @xcite for some key steps in this program , and @xcite for a more complete list of references .",
    "understanding liouville theory from the point of view of its integrable structure has also attracted considerable interest in the past , going back to @xcite , and more recently being developed in @xcite .",
    "this approach has also lead to beautiful results , see in particular @xcite .",
    "what seemed somewhat unsatisfactory , however , was the lack of results that can be directly compared with the conformal field theory approach .",
    "it is the second main aim of this paper to re - derive the so - called reflection amplitude of liouville theory with the help of its integrable structure .",
    "the formula for this quantity had been conjectured in @xcite .",
    "a derivation for these conjectures was subsequently given in @xcite .",
    "here we are going to re - derive this result in a completely different way , entirely based on the integrable structure of liouville theory .    however , we feel that the interplay between conformal and integrable structures is still not completely understood .",
    "it seems particularly important to integrate the lattice virasoro algebra @xcite into the picture and to clarify the relations with the beautiful work @xcite where closely related models of statistical mechanics were studied .",
    "what we do hope , however , is that this paper lays some useful groundwork which will ultimately lead to a better understanding of this important subject .",
    "this paper is intended to give a reasonably concise overview over the main constructions , ideas and results of our work .",
    "it is not self - contained . in order to make the verification of our claims possible ,",
    "we either give sketches of the proofs or indicate references where similar arguments can be found .",
    "a more detailed presentation is in preparation .",
    "the aim of this section is to define three lattice models , corresponding to the sinh - gordon model , liouville theory and the scalar free field theory , respectively .",
    "anticipating discussions of its integrable structure we will refer to the scalar free field theory as kdv theory below .",
    "the classical counterparts of the models in question are dynamical systems whose degrees of freedom are described by the field @xmath6 defined for @xmath7\\times { { \\mathbb r}}$ ] with periodic boundary conditions @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamics of these models may be described in the hamiltonian form in terms of variables @xmath6 , @xmath9 , the poisson brackets being @xmath10 the time - evolution of an arbitrary observable @xmath11 is then given as @xmath12 with hamiltonian @xmath13 being defined as @xmath14 in order to regularize the ultraviolet divergencies that arise in the quantization of these models we will pass to integrable lattice discretizations .",
    "first discretize the field variables according to the standard recipe @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lattice spacing .",
    "quantization is then canonical : the variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are henceforth considered as operators with commutation relations @xmath20}\\,=\\,2\\pi i{\\delta}_{n , m}\\,,\\ ] ] that can be realized in the usual way on the hilbert space @xmath21 . as another convenient set of variables let us introduce the operators @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 this change of variables is invertible for @xmath24 odd .",
    "we will therefore restrict our attention to this case in the following .",
    "the variables @xmath25 satisfy the algebraic relations @xmath26 these operators turn out to represent the initial data for time evolution in a particularly convenient way , as we are going to discuss next .      a beautiful way to define a suitable dynamics in these lattice models",
