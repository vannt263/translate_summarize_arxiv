    "at very low temperatures of a few kelvin rare gas atoms may assemble and form clusters due to the van der waals interaction .",

    "a few kelvin already suffices to lead to all impacts mentioned above .",
    "thus , accurate quantum mechanical computations are essential to obtain reliable results . in numerical calculations",
    "the boltzmann operator at inverse temperature @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ( due to its form also called imaginary time propagator ) is the most important quantity .",
    "its trace yields the partition function @xmath3 , and the thermal averages of every observable @xmath4 follow from @xmath5",
    ". however , precise calculations for multi - dimensional systems are still a challenge for today s numerical possibilities .",
    "for example , path - integral monte carlo methods have been used to investigate rare gas clusters . at low temperatures",
    "they become already too expensive for a few dozen atoms , and efficient but sufficiently accurate approximations are required .",
    "these approximations have to reproduce quantum effects correctly since they will be of eminent importance at low temperatures .",
    "still many questions are open .",
    "for example @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite might exhibit novel low temperature quantum effects , such as liquid - like zero temperature structures of @xmath7 as compared to a solid - like structure predicted from classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "semiclassical methods help even with presently available computation capabilities to overcome the numerical drawbacks of numerically exact quantum mechanical algorithms and are still developed and applied in a wide context concerning thermodynamic properties .",
    "important semiclassical approximations are based on the idea to restrict the quantum mechanical wave functions to a gaussian shape .",
    "the gaussian functions are defined completely by a low number of parameters as the position of the center , a momentum of the wave packet and a width matrix .",
    "the lowest numerical effort is achieved with a frozen gaussian propagator , i.e.  a gaussian wave function of which the width matrix in the exponent is fixed for all imaginary times ( or temperatures ) .",
    "small argon clusters are among those rare gas clusters which attracted large interest for a long time and again recently . despite their apparent simplicity numerical calculations turned out to be nontrivial , and for the argon trimer even sophisticated path - integral monte carlo calculations could not distinguish a complete dissociation from structural changes within a bound system because the numerics suffered strongly from noise @xcite .",
    "the frozen gaussian imaginary time propagator has proved to provide high quality results .",
    "it could solve this question and identified an almost classical dissociation effect @xcite , which was confirmed @xcite with a first - order correction to the semiclassical imaginary time propagator @xcite .",
    "for the more complicated @xmath8 cluster the specific heat and mean energy do not provide enough information to understand its whole structure .",
    "it is important to know which alignment of the atoms is present .",
    "a very detailed knowledge of the atomic structure is available via the inter - particle distances . to obtain their values",
    "it is very common to compute the radial pair correlation function between particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 at positions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , @xmath13    /z(\\beta ) ,    \\label{eq : pair_correlation}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the thermal average at inverse temperature @xmath1 and @xmath15 represents the imaginary time propagator at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "this quantity provides information about the distribution of the distances occurring at every temperature .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the frozen gaussian method applied to atomic clusters in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to determine the distances of the atoms in clusters in a numerically cheap and easy way . to do so , an extension to the semiclassical frozen gaussian method will be developed .",
    "the mean values and the variances of the distances @xmath16 between atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 can directly be accessed and provide a very clear information of how the atoms are arranged in the cluster . since the distances @xmath16 of the single pairs can be calculated in parallel with the same monte carlo sampling all of these values can be obtained with low numerical extra cost .",
    "this provides for @xmath17 atoms @xmath18 independent values , whereas in the pair correlation function small differences in the mean distances might be hidden below broad distributions .",
    "the example of the @xmath8 cluster investigated in this article demonstrates the importance of the additional structural information even in this relatively simple system , which does not undergo a structural transformation in the bound state .",
    "the mean energy and the specific heat will show that the cluster dissociates with increasing temperature to a system of six free atoms in one step .",
    "however , precursors of the dissociation will only be observable in the distances between the atoms , which will indicate a loss of the ground state configuration at slightly lower temperatures .",
    "the variances of the distances will turn out to be very sensitive to the breakdown of the structure .",
    "the further sections of this paper are organized as follows . in sec.[sec : method ] mean values and variances for inter - atomic distances with the frozen gaussian method are introduced . for comparison",

    "it leads to a value of @xmath113 , i.e.  the difference of the ground state s binding energy is only @xmath114 .",
    "thus , one may conclude that also for the larger @xmath8 cluster the quality of the frozen gaussian propagator is acceptable in comparison with the numerically more expensive thawed gaussian variant even for the low - temperature limit .",
    "the dissociation appears in the mean energy as a step .",
    "the energy raises almost directly to that of six free particles .",
    "this indicates a dissociation of all atoms at once as was observed for the trimer .",
    "the same information can be gained from the specific heat , which is shown around the dissociation in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] ( b ) .",
    "one broad peak confirms that the dissociation occurs in one step .",
    "the classical calculation shows a transition at a slightly lower temperature , and the difference between the two maxima in the specific heat is approximately @xmath115 , which is lower than for the trimer , where a difference of @xmath116 was observed .",
    "certainly the difference can again be related to the zero point energy in quantum mechanics .",
    "this is larger for six atoms than for three and one could expect that also the temperature difference is larger .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that this energy has to be distributed among a larger number of atoms during the dissociation .",
    "since aside from the small shift in the temperature the dissociation process is almost identical in the classical and the frozen gaussian calculation one may conclude that it is a purely classical phenomenon .",
    "in addition to the information of the simple derivatives of the partition function the mean distances are studied . since so far the dissociation seems to be purely classical it is interesting to also compare the structural information with the classical one . to do so , the classical mean distances @xmath117 are added in the calculations below .",
    "the mean distances obtained for temperatures below @xmath118 , i.e.significantly below the dissociation process , are shown in fig.[fig : dist_low ] ,    ( color online ) ( a ) comparison of the mean values of all 15 distances calculated with the frozen gaussian method ( 2p - fg ) and a classical calculation at temperatures @xmath119 .",

    "[ fig : dist_low ] ( a ) , and then the fully - coupled thawed gaussian approximation is added in fig .  [",
    "fig : dist_low ] ( b ) .",
    "the most striking observation is that the distances appear in the low - temperature limit in two groups .",
    "a group of three `` long '' distances , of which the values are always above @xmath121 for @xmath120 , and a second group of the 12 remaining `` short '' distances , which converge to a value below @xmath122 , exist .",
    "this already gives a clear answer to the question about the ground state configuration of @xmath8 .",
    "it is consistent with the distances in an octahedron , or in other words , the atoms are located at the centers of the surfaces of its dual polyhedron , viz.the cube .",
    "twelve short distances @xmath123 from the atoms on neighboring surfaces and three longer distances @xmath124 between the atoms on opposite surfaces are expected .",
    "the ratio of the distances is supposed to be @xmath125 , which is fulfilled excellently in both the classical and semiclassical calculations .    in the classical case",
    "the atoms seek directly the potential minima , whereas in the quantum case always a wave function with a finite width leading automatically to larger mean distances is present . furthermore ,",
    "in the classical case the fixed octahedron configuration is only observable for @xmath120 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that classically every nonvanishing energy allows for a thermal excitation .",
    "in contrast to this there should be no excitation possible if @xmath126 is clearly below the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state in the quantum mechanical case .",
    "this is also reflected in the mean distances .",
    "for temperatures below @xmath127 no differences between the distances in one group are observed , and the distances do not change for even lower temperatures .",
    "this indicates that the cluster is already in the ground state configuration .",
    "a comparison of the frozen gaussian method with the fully - coupled thawed gaussian propagator reveals that the distances agree very well .",
    "this is in particular true for all larger distances .",
    "also the low temperature limit shows an excellent agreement .",
    "the edge length of the cube containing the octahedron is @xmath128 in the frozen gaussian calculation and @xmath129 in the thawed gaussian approximation .",
    "the difference is below @xmath130 , and thus even smaller than that of the mean energy .",
    "obviously the structural information of the frozen gaussian method is less affected by the constant gaussian width approximation .    with the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_low ] we are also able to estimate the quality of the approximation , in which the power series expansion of the distances was introduced .",
    "the first - order term retained in the expansion is of the size @xmath131 where for the width matrix @xmath132 is obtained . with the knowledge that the typical distances @xmath133 are even in the bound phase of the order of a few ngstrms this correction can be estimated to be always less than @xmath130 of the leading order .",
    "hence , it has at most the same size as the difference between the two semiclassical propagators .",
    "higher orders in the series expansion would lead to even smaller corrections , which do not need to be taken into account since they are below the error of the semiclassical approximation .",

    "where the classical and 2p - fg results are compared . since the frozen gaussian approximation is known to provide good results at these temperatures ( cf.ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a comparison with the thawed gaussian propagator does not give any new information .",
    "figure [ fig : dist_high ] confirms the finding of the consideration of the mean energy and the specific heat in fig .",

    "the dissociation effect is classical .",
    "the semiclassical approximation of the quantum mechanical propagator and the purely classical calculation lead to the same behavior . apart from a small shift in temperature",
    "both diagrams agree very well .",
    "the calculation of the distances gives additional insight into the dissociation process . for temperatures @xmath135 the groups of short and long distances are unchanged .",
    "above this temperature two of the twelve distances @xmath123 are separating from the others and join the three longer distances @xmath124 .",
    "two new groups with five and ten distances start to from . for @xmath0 a second isomer in the form of a tri - tetrahedron",
    "is known to contribute at increasing temperatures @xcite .",

    "shown is a thermal average of size - ordered distances as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : sizeorder ] . with increasing temperature one distance becomes larger than the others before all raise drastically . ]    at low temperatures all distances have almost the same size , which agrees with a pure octahedron configuration . with increasing temperature one distance grows and indicates a coexistence of octahedron and tri - tetrahedron configurations .",
    "signatures of further arrangements of the atoms are not found .",
    "however , this rearrangement of the atoms remains in its beginnings .",
    "a new structure can not completely arise since the whole process does not finish before all distances raise drastically and indicate with this increase the dissociation of the cluster .",
    "comparisons with calculations , in which due to a smaller value of @xmath97 no dissociation is allowed , show that this effect only appears in connection with the dissociation .",
    "thus , the separation of the two distances is more a precursor of the total destruction of the cluster .",
    "the dissociation happens then at once .",
    "after the dissociation the distances obtain new almost constant values which correspond to the distribution of atoms moving freely within the confining sphere .",
    "to learn more about the actual distribution of the distances their standard deviations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : variances ] ( a ) and ( b )    ( color online ) ( a ) standard deviations @xmath137 of the distances in the frozen gaussian approximation ( 2p - fg ) and ( b ) of the classical calculation . they increase drastically around the dissociation .",

    "the most significant feature is the drastic increase of the standard deviations around the transition . at this",
    "temperature range parts of the simulated clusters are still in a bound configuration whereas others are already dissociated .",
    "the effect is similar and of the same size for the classical and the semiclassical calculation . for temperatures above the dissociation",
    "the standard deviations are almost the same for all distances , which is also expected for six free atoms .    of more interest",
    "is the behavior of the standard deviations below the dissociation .",
    "the longer distances are expected to show more fluctuations .",
    "additionally two of the shorter distances join the group of the three longer distances for increasing temperatures as a consequence of contributions from two isomers .",
    "it can also be expected that these two show higher standard deviations than the short distances since the separation of the two distances does not happen abruptly at one temperature as can be seen in fig.[fig : dist_high ] .",
    "consequently , below the dissociation the standard deviations are found to form two groups .",
    "one group combines the standard deviations of five distances , i.e.  the three longer ones and the two joining them .",
    "the other group consists of the standard deviations of the 10 short distances which stay together up to the temperature of the dissociation .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : variances ] ( a ) and ( b ) it seems that the standard deviations always decrease for lower temperatures .",
    "this is definitely expected for the classical calculation .",
    "the frozen gaussian approximation can , since the width of the wave function is determined by the constant values of @xmath24 , not reflect the quantum mechanical expectation that the wave function stretches at lower temperatures . to cover also this effect the quantum mechanical part according to equation",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : variances ] ( c ) .",
    "only the variance of one of the distances is shown since this part is almost identical for all of them in the highly symmetric situation of a monoatomic cluster . at @xmath138",
    "the variance has approximately the same size as that following from the frozen gaussian method @xmath139 .",
    "in particular , these quantum mechanical parts of the variances are considerably lower than other contributions in equations and .",
    "figure [ fig : variances ] ( a ) would not change with the thawed gaussian propagator . only for temperatures @xmath140",
    "the extension of the wave function becomes important for a measurement of the distances . for temperatures in the range of the dissociation",
    "the information from the frozen gaussian method is completely sufficient .",
    "all calculations shown in this section could be implemented and performed easily on a nvidia tesla c2070 gpu . on this architecture",
    "a converged result for low temperatures is obtained in less than 20 hours .",
    "the most critical part is that around the dissociation , where a very detailed sampling for bound configurations has to be done alongside an inclusion of large distances allowing for an unbound cluster .",
    "this can require an increase of the sampling points by a factor of 10 .",
    "in this article it was shown that structural information about a cluster of atoms can be obtained with the frozen gaussian semiclassical method in a numerically cheap way .",
    "the evaluation of the corresponding integrals can be done in parallel to that of the partition function . with this method",
    "the full information about all the distances of all combinations of the atoms can be obtained . a comparison with",
    "the more flexible thawed gaussian propagator revealed that the quality of the distances is on the same level as that of the mean energy or the specific heat , or even better . to avoid inefficient numerical computations of a position space integral an approximation for the distances",
    "was introduced .",
    "it was possible , however , to show that this approximation does not reduce the quality of the results below that obtained in the semiclassical approximation of the propagator .    on the physical side it was found that with increasing temperatures the @xmath8 cluster undergoes an almost direct transition to six free atoms",
    "however , it shows precursors in the distances . at temperatures slightly below the dissociation",
    "a reordering of the atoms starts , in which contributions from a second isomer , viz .",
    "a tri - tetrahedron @xcite , appear , but then vanish in the increasing distances at the dissociation .",
    "the dissociation is a purely classical effect .",
    "the semiclassical approximation shows exactly the same behavior with just a small shift in the temperature of @xmath115 . around the dissociation",
    "the standard deviations of the distances are almost completely determined by classical contributions . only for lower temperatures",
    "the extension of the wave functions becomes important as was seen in a thawed gaussian approximation .    at low temperatures",
    "the cluster assumes the shape of an octahedron , where the longer distance between the atoms is @xmath141 , and the shorter has the value @xmath142 .",
    "classically the fixed configuration is only obtained in the limit @xmath104 whereas in the quantum mechanical case the ground state configuration is present for all temperatures @xmath143 .",
    "the frozen gaussian method has proved to provide reliable results for quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "there is a large number of investigations which can be done with it . in particular , the results for @xmath102 in @xcite and for @xmath8 in this work indicate that the confinement to very small spheres usually applied in the calculation of the partition function and values deduced from it @xcite only sample bound cluster configurations . this is physically realized at high pressures .",
    "if one is interested in lower pressures , at which a dissociation is allowed , this is too restrictive to fully understand the low - temperature behavior of the clusters .",
    "the dissociation can set in before structural changes or a melting can be observed . to take this into account",
    "it is necessary to advance the investigations done here to clusters with higher numbers of atoms . in particular , the cases of @xmath144 , @xmath6 @xcite or @xmath7 @xcite are of special interest since they showed interesting structural transformations in the non - dissociated cases . whereas the stronger quantum effects in the completely bound case are well covered by a variable width matrix the numerically cheaper frozen gaussian method has advantages in the numerically more challenging case of the dissociation requiring a sampling of bound and unbound configurations of the atoms .",
    "the exactness of both methods can then be monitored and ( if necessary ) improved with the the series expansion of the imaginary time propagator @xcite .",
    "the importance of the series expansion is not restricted to the dissociation .",
    "most effects in rare gas clusters such as structural transformations or dissociations appear at such low temperatures that it is necessary to analyze whether the semiclassical approximations used in the calculations correctly reproduce the true quantum mechanical behavior .",
    "an important example will be @xmath7 , for which strong differences are found between the approximate quantum computations and a purely classical theory @xcite .",
