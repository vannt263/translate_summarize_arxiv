    "the crab pulsar ( psr  j0534 + 2200 ) , one of the youngest pulsars in our galaxy , shows pulsed signals in a very wide energy range from radio to @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , see abdo et al .",

    "lat between 100  mev and 20  gev ) . in the highest energy range",
    ", the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkev ( magic ) telescope has detected pulsed signals at 25  gev ( aliu et al . 2008 ) , which was confirmed by the lat observations ( atwood et al . 2009 ) .",
    "further observations with the magic telescope and the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) have shown that this component extends up to 400  gev ( aleksi et al .",
    "2012 ; aliu et al .",
    "2011 ) .    to explain such pulsed fluxes in the very high energy ( vhe ) region ( i.e. , above 100  gev ) , bednarek ( 2012 ) proposed the light cylinder ( lc ) gap model from the following reasons : the rotationally induced",
    ", goldreich - julian ( gj ) charge density is given by ( goldreich - julian  1969 ) @xmath1       \\left [ 1-(\\varpi/\\varpi_{\\rm lc})^2        \\right]^{-1 } , $ ] where @xmath2 denotes the rotation vector of the neutron star , @xmath3 its rotation frequency , @xmath4 the magnetic field at each point , @xmath5 the distance from the rotation axis , @xmath6 the radius of the lc measured from the rotation axis , and @xmath7 the speed of light . if the real charge density , @xmath8 , coincides @xmath9 at every position , the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath10 , vanishes in the entire region of the magnetosphere .",
    "if @xmath8 deviates from @xmath9 at some position , on the other hand , the acceleration electric field @xmath10 will arise around that position . in this expression",
    ", @xmath9 appears to diverge at the lc , @xmath11 ; thus , it was argued if @xmath8 inevitably deviates from @xmath9 near the lc . by virtue of this diverging behavior of @xmath9 , an extremely strong @xmath10 , which is about @xmath12 stronger than what arises in the outer - magnetospheric particle accelerator ( or the outer gap ) ,",
    "was assumed to arise in the lc gap , and the resultant curvature emission was implied to reproduce the pulsed spectrum observed from the crab pulsar up to 400  gev .",
    "in   [ sec : gj ] , we demonstrate that the lc gap model is not feasible , examining the actual @xmath9 distribution .",
    "then in   [ sec : disc ] , we briefly mention an appropriate way to compute @xmath9 .",
    "in the special relativistic limit , the gj charge density is given by ( e.g. , mestel & wang  1982 ) @xmath13 from the inhomogeneous part of the maxwell equations , we obtain , @xmath14 since the plasmas are highly collision - less in a pulsar magnetosphere , charged particles gyrate many times between collisions .",
    "thus , we must construct the electric current @xmath15 from the gyrating and drifting motion of charged particles , not from the generalized ohm s law .",
    "let us decompose the current into the parallel and perpendicular components with respect to the local magnetic field line , @xmath16    first , we consider the parallel current . since the radiation force balances with the electrostatic acceleration , particles distribution becomes mono - energetic .",
    "thus , denoting the terminal velocity of out - going particles ( e.g. , positrons ) with @xmath17 , and in - going ones ( e.g. , electrons ) with @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) denotes the number density of out - going ( or in - going ) particles , and @xmath22 is given by ( hirotani 2011 , apj 733 , l49 ) @xmath23 @xmath24 denotes the charge on the out - going particle ( presumably the positron ) , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the toroidal component of the magnetic field . in the higher altitudes ( e.g. , near the lc ) , it is reasonable to assume @xmath27 in the gap . in this case , the real charge density is given by @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath29 even if @xmath30 , the additional term that would appear in the right - hand side will not change the entire discussion of this paper ; however , we assume @xmath31 to clarify the logic .",
    "second , we consider the perpendicular current .",
    "it is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the pressure associated with the longitudinal and perpendicular motion with respect to the magnetic field ; @xmath35 ( in the second line ) denotes the mass density of the plasmas , and @xmath36 the temporal derivative of the electric field projected on the perpendicular plane to @xmath4 .",
    "in the right - hand side , the first term represents the current due to the @xmath37 drift , the second term the sum of the currents due to the magnetic - gradient and the magnetic - curvature drift , the third term ( in the second line ) the polarization - drift current , and the last term the magnetization current . in a collision - less plasma ,",
    "the pressure tensor becomes highly anisotropic . in a pulsar magnetosphere",
    ", pairs are created inwards ( via photon - photon and/or magnetic pair creation in the middle or lower altitudes ) with the typical lorentz factor of a few thousand .",
    "thus , positrons ( or electrons ) lose most of their perpendicular momentum when they return outwards by a positive ( or a negative ) @xmath10 in a strong magnetic field . moreover , their pitch angles decrease due to a subsequent acceleration by @xmath10 , resulting in @xmath38 . thus ,",
    "for particles migrating in the outer magnetosphere , we obtain @xmath39    in a co - rotating magnetosphere , we can put @xmath40 and have @xmath41 .",
    "thus , combining equations  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : divb ] ) , ( [ eq : j1 ] ) , ( [ eq : j4 ] ) , and ( [ eq : j7 ] ) , we obtain @xmath42    \\rho_{\\rm gj }    }    \\nonumber\\\\    & = & -\\frac{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\omega$}\\cdot\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$ } }              { 2\\pi c }        + \\frac{\\mbox{\\boldmath$e$}_{\\hat\\varphi}\\cdot\\dot{e } }              { 4\\pi c }         \\frac{\\varpi}{\\varpi_{\\rm lc } } ,    \\label{eq : rho_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 denotes the toroidal unit vector .",
    "note that @xmath47 is much small compared to @xmath48 if particles efficiently radiate , and that @xmath49 .",
    "we thus finally obtain @xmath50 in the numerator , the second term is usually small compared to the first term . in the denominator , we should notice that @xmath51 is positive definite , provided @xmath52 .",
    "for example , at the lc , we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath54 it follows that the denominator of equation  ( [ eq : rho_2 ] ) does not vanish at the lc , provided that the magnetic field is toroidally bent .",
    "moreover , near the lc , we obtain @xmath55 therefore , the gj charge density is kept around its newtonian value , @xmath56 , even near the lc .",
    "we can confirm this result by substituting the solution of the vacuum , rotating dipole magnetic field ( cheng et al . 2000 ) into equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : rhogj ] , we plot @xmath57 $ ] as a function of the distance along each magnetic field line . the magnetic inclination angle @xmath58 between the magnetic and rotational axes ,",
    "is assumed to be @xmath59 for the solid , dashed , dotted curves , whereas @xmath60 for the dot - dot - dot - dashed one .",
    "the solid ( or dashed ) curves show the results in the trailing ( or leading ) side of the rotating magnetosphere .",
    "the filled circle denotes the position at which the field line crosses the light cylinder .",
    "it is confirmed by this explicit calculation that @xmath9 is kept around its newtonian value even near the lc .",
    "the conclusion is unchanged for small inclination angles . adopting the vacuum rotating magnetic dipole solution",
    ", we obtain @xmath61 if @xmath62 . as a result ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rho_2 ] ) appears to give a diverging @xmath9 at the lc .",
    "nevertheless , the vacuum solution gives @xmath63 when @xmath62 .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) shows that @xmath9 exhibits no singular behavior at the lc . we plot the case of @xmath62 as the dot - dot - dot - dashed curve in figure  [ fig : rhogj ] , calculating equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) from the vacuum , rotating dipole solution .",
    "it follows that @xmath9 does not change rapidly at the lc also for an aligned rotator , as expected .",
    ", as a function of the distance along the last - open magnetic field line , for discrete values of azimuthal angles , @xmath64 , measured counter - clockwise around the magnetic axis on the polar - cap surface .",
    "magnetic inclination angle is assumed to be @xmath59 for the solid , dashed , and dotted curves , while @xmath60 for the dot - dot - dot - dashed one .",
    "the solid curves represent @xmath65 in the trailing side of the rotating magnetosphere ( from the top , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ) , while the dashed ones in the leading side ( from the top , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ) .",
    "the rotational and magnetic axes , as well as the footpoints of the magnetic field lines of @xmath70 and @xmath71 at the polar - cap surface , reside on the same meridional plane . from the magnetic pole",
    ", the direction @xmath70 points the rotation axis , while @xmath71 the equator .",
    "the filled circle denotes the position at which the distance from the rotation axis becomes the light cylinder radius .",
    ", width=302 ]     recently , bednarek ( 2012 ) assumed that @xmath9 becomes as large as @xmath72 in a short length @xmath73 along the magnetic field line in the vicinity of the lc , and considered the curvature radiation that reproduces the pulsed emissions up to 400  gev from the crab pulsar .",
    "however , since @xmath9 is kept of the order of @xmath74 even at the lc , this assumption can not be justified . in another word , the light cylinder gap , which is suggested to produce the pulsed vhe emission from the crab pulsar",
    ", does not appear in any pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the goldreich - julian charge density does not show any singular behavior at the light cylinder .",
    "we may note , in passing , that the goldreich - julian charge density should be computed from equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) directly , using the given magnetic field distribution in the three - dimensional rotating magnetosphere , instead of replacing @xmath75 with the current ( i.e. , instead of using eq .",
    "[ [ eq : rho_2 ] ] ) .",
    "we should notice here that we derive equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) only from the maxwell equation , @xmath76 , and the frozen - in condition , assuming stationarity in the co - moving frame , namely @xmath77 , where @xmath78 represents the field - strength tensor , @xmath79 the non - corotational potential , and @xmath80 ( hirotani  2006 ) .",
    "that is , equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) holds for arbitrary magnetic field , and is derived irrespective of how the current is constructed , or how the plasmas are collisional or collision - less .",
    "let us briefly perform a thought experiment .",
    "if the plasma density is large enough , sufficient collisions allow us to use the generalized ohm s law to describe the current . in this case",
    ", @xmath9 does not diverge at the lc , because the @xmath81 term in the coefficient of @xmath9 in equation  ( [ eq : rho_1 ] ) comes from the @xmath82 drift , which is not included in the ohm s law .",
    "for example , the magnetohydrodynamic approximation , which uses the ohm s law to close the equations , shows that all the physical quantities are well - behaved at the lc ( e.g. , tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "next , imagine that the plasmas suddenly escape from the magnetosphere to become collision - less .",
    "even in this case , @xmath9 should not be changed at all , because @xmath9 is determined only by the @xmath4 field through equation  ( [ eq : def_rhogj_1 ] ) , independently from the collisional status of plasmas .",
    "thus , @xmath9 does not diverge at the lc also in the collision - less limit .",
    "for example , in the force - free limit , which adopts the @xmath82 drift in @xmath83 , no physical quantities diverge or rapidly change at the lc ( e.g. , spitkovsky 2006 ) , except for the current sheet , in which the force - free approximation breaks down .    in general",
    ", quantities behave normally across the lc , without showing any divergence or quick variations .",
    "thus , the light cylinder gap , which has an extreme acceleration electric field ( as @xmath12 times stronger than the outer gap ) , will not arise in a pulsar magnetosphere , unfortunately .",
