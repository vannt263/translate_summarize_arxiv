    "force transmission in granular materials is a well - studied problem with wide ranging applications @xcite , and several properties of stress transmission in granular media continue to be the subject of active research @xcite . it is known that the usual elasticity theories for homogeneous materials do not apply to materials with granular constituents , and therefore new frameworks need to be developed to deal with such systems .",
    "one of the most important characteristics that has emerged from these studies is the inhomogeneous nature of this stress propagation .",
    "a striking aspect of granular systems is that forces are primarily carried by a sparse , tenuous network of contacts that have become known as  force chains \" .",
    "experiments using photoelastic beads provide clear evidence of this phenomenon @xcite , and force chains have emerged as the defining characteristic of granular solids . yet , at present we do not have a theory of how forces are localized in space and the role played by network disorder on the character of this spatial localization @xcite .",
    "the statics of granular media is controlled by the constraints of mechanical equilibrium , which is the main ingredient in models of such systems .",
    "several theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain how granular materials respond to external forces @xcite .",
    "these include lattice - based models such as the @xmath0-model @xcite , and its extensions @xcite , and continuum models that posit some history - dependent relation between the components of the stress tensor @xcite .",
    "these frameworks lead to partial differential equations ( pdes ) that are elliptic , hyperbolic or parabolic depending on these closure relations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-model , which incorporates scalar force balance in a model of granular piles in a gravitational field @xcite , successfully accounts for the distribution of contact forces in the large force limit . in the continuum limit",
    ", the model reduces to the diffusion equation , predicting a horizontal spread of force - bearing contacts that grows as the square - root of the depth in the granular pile .",
    "such a spread is observed in experiments under certain conditions of preparation @xcite .",
    "models with hyperbolic pdes and disorder predict a wave - like propagation , which is similar to experimental observations in ordered arrays of grains @xcite .",
    "thus , the relationship between the stress response of granular materials and the underlying disorder of the contact network remains to be understood .",
    "one of the important open questions in the field of granular systems is , how does one account for _ vector force balance _ on a disordered network of contacts ? in this paper we address this problem by studying the response of a two dimensional granular material to an externally applied force .",
    "we show that the inhomogeneous propagation of stress through the system can be linked to the inherent randomness in the underlying fabric of contacts .",
    "we connect the problem of stress transmission in this system to that of diffusion on the disordered planar graph formed by the contacts between the constituent grains .",
    "this allows us to develop a theoretical framework to describe the response of such a granular system to an imposed body force , and thereby probe the origin of the force localization properties in such systems .",
    "the constraints of mechanical equilibrium , that are necessarily satisfied in a static granular packing , lead to a gauge potential formulation of forces and stresses @xcite .",
    "we show that the response of the internal forces to an applied body force can be described by an additional set of gauge potentials , which satisfy equations involving the laplacian of the contact network . by introducing these auxiliary fields",
    "we can account for the change in the local stress tensor induced by an external perturbation .",
    "in addition to introducing the formalism , we present results of exact diagonalization studies of network laplacians produced using numerical simulations of soft disk packings .",
    "these clearly illustrate the localization properties of force transmission in such materials . although our formulation is valid for a general granular packing , in our simulations we focus specifically on linear spring potentials of fricitionless soft disks .",
    "finally we discuss the role of additional constraints such as torque balance in determining the stability of granular packings to external perturbations .",
    "in this section we discuss the constraints that need to be satisfied at the local level in a static granular packing .",
    "the local nature of these constraints allows a description of the system in terms of gauge potentials .",
    "local constraints are also crucial in determining the response of jammed packings to external perturbations , and give rise to deviations from linear elasticity .",
    "granular systems are inherently porous with voids interspersed between grains in _ contact _ , and are inhomogeneous on the granular scale .",
    "this non - isotropic fabric of the underlying material leads to interesting properties of stress transmission between the grains in the system .",
    "a challenge in granular mechanics is to understand how this  graininess \" @xcite affects the bulk behavior of granular solids . in order to associate local quantities to granular packings with complex internal structures such as non - convex voids ( see fig .",
    "[ grain_void_figure ] ) , it becomes necessary to associate well defined regions of space to specific parts of the packing .",
    "in two dimensional granular packings , the plane can be decomposed into polygonal regions belonging to _ grains _ as well as to _ voids _ ( see fig .",
    "[ grain_void_figure ] ) .",
    "the grain polygons are formed by connecting the contact points on the boundaries of each grain in a cyclic manner .",
    "the void polygons are formed in a similar manner by cyclically connecting the contacts associated with each void .",
    "the grain and void polygons together tessellate the entire space .",
    "this construction allows a decomposition of the space into well defined polygonal regions and provides a way of probing the spatial structure of granular materials @xcite .",
    "the two graphs formed by adjacent grains and adjacent voids are _ dual _ to each other .",
    "as we show in the next sections , this construction allows one to construct local gauge fields associated with these polygons which encodes the local force balance conditions .",
    "the stability of granular materials stems from the fact that each individual configuration is in _ mechanical equilibrium_. the internal stresses in jammed packings",
    "are mediated via _ contact forces _ between the constituent grains which are pairwise within the system .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium condition translates to the fact that the forces acting on every grain sum to zero . for packings with only contact forces within the system ,",
    "this condition can be represented by the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the force acting on the grain @xmath3 , through the contact @xmath4 .",
    "the sum is taken over all the contacts @xmath5 for a given grain @xmath3 .",
    "next , newton s _ third law _ dictates that @xmath6 at each contact @xmath4 between the grains @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "these two equations ( eqs . ( [ force_sum_zero ] ) and ( [ third_law ] ) ) can be used to construct an alternative representation of the forces in a two dimensional granular packing in terms of vector height fields which we discuss in the next section .",
    "are associated with the void polygons @xmath8 ( shaded light blue ) .",
    "the grain polygons @xmath9 are shown in white .",
    "the forces between the grains are represented by ( bidirectional ) arrows with @xmath10 at each contact @xmath4 .",
    "the forces at each contact are given by the difference of heights on the two voids associated with each contact ( with a cyclic convention , i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "the vectors @xmath12 define the vectors connecting the two contacts on grain @xmath3 that form an edge of the void polygon @xmath13 . ]      the force balance condition combined with newton s third law naturally leads to an alternative representation of the forces in the system , parametrized by a vector height field that lives on the edges of the void polygons @xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "[ explanatory_figure1 ] , each contact in a two dimensional granular packing is shared by two void polygons .",
    "we define a set of height vectors on the voids @xmath14 , where @xmath13 indexes the voids in the system .",
    "the force at each contact @xmath4 is given by the _ difference of heights _ on the two voids associated with each contact @xmath15 with @xmath13 and @xmath16 ordered cyclically around the centre of the grain @xmath3 .",
    "this naturally leads to eq .",
    "( [ third_law ] ) , as the force on grain @xmath7 through the contact @xmath4 is simply @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the contact forces are associated with the network of contacts between grains , the height vectors are _ associated with the dual lattice _ of the contact network i.e. the network of voids @xmath8 .",
    "the cyclic convention allows one to visualize the heights as vector currents circulating in the counterclockwise direction on the edges of a void polygon @xcite .",
    "given a set of contact forces , the definition of @xmath14 is unique , modulo a choice of origin : they are gauge potentials for the stress tensor",
    ". this uniqueness of the height representation is ensured by the force balance condition ( eq . [ force_sum_zero ] ) . traversing a path around any non - trivial loop within the system returns to the same value of the height field .",
    "this can be easily seen by circulating around each grain , which form the basic loops in the system . as an example we consider a grain @xmath18 which has four neighbours @xmath19 in contact through contacts @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ explanatory_figure1 ] ) . using the definition of the heights in eq .",
    "( [ height_definition ] ) , the forces acting on the grain @xmath18 are given by @xmath21 the left hand side represents the force on every contact of the grain @xmath18 which sums to zero , while the right hand side represents the difference in the heights at each contact . starting with a value @xmath22 on the first void",
    ", the values of the heights around the grain @xmath18 can be cyclically constructed using the contact forces .",
    "the force balance condition thus necessitates that the heights around the loop return to the same value @xmath22 .",
    "the non - trivial nature of the loops that can occur in higher dimensions is the main obstacle in extending this simple height construction beyond two dimensions .",
    "given the forces within the system , the stress tensor for a given packing is then defined as @xmath23 here @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the position of the contact @xmath4 , and @xmath26 being the position of the centre of the grain @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath27 represents the volume of the entire system .",
    "the vectors @xmath12 define the vectors connecting the two contacts on grain @xmath3 ( cyclically ) that form an edge of the void polygon @xmath13 ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ grain_void_figure ] ) . using the representation of @xmath28 in terms of the height vectors ,",
    "it is easy to show that the total force moment tensor reduces to a boundary term @xcite , which is the discrete version of stokes theorem . from a continuum perspective",
    ", the height fields can therefore be viewed as the gauge potential that enforces @xmath29 .",
    "finally it is important to note that a well defined height field at the local level can only be constructed in situations where pairwise forces are the only forces present in the system , since both eqs .",
    "( [ force_sum_zero ] ) and ( [ third_law ] ) are essential to the construction .",
    "therefore several cases of interest are excluded from this framework , most notably systems where body forces , such as gravity , act on the grains .",
    "similarly granular systems that are perturbed by an external force are also not amenable to a height description .",
    "it is therefore important to extend the gauge field treatment to such cases . in section [ response_to_perturbation_section ]",
    "we extend this height construction to such cases , which allows us to study the transmission of stress within two dimensional granular materials .",
    "in addition to local force balance , a mechanically stable configuration must also satisfy _ torque balance _ at the grain level .",
    "these are represented by the set of equations @xmath30 where the sum is taken over all the contacts @xmath5 for a given grain @xmath3 . in continuum",
    ", the torque balance constraint translates to the symmetric property of the stress tensor . finally , in order for the packing to be valid",
    ", it must also satisfy additional constraints in real space .",
    "for example , the vector sum of inter particle distances taken over every closed trajectory in the system , must sum to zero .",
    "for the planar contact network in two dimensional packings , these constraints can be parameterized by the set of basic loops that enclose each void .",
    "these can then be represented by the set of equations @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the interparticle distance vector between two adjacent grains located at @xmath33 and @xmath26 respectively . the sum is taken over all adjacent pairs @xmath34 surrounding each void @xmath13",
    "this illustrates the fact that for systems where the forces are related to the inter particle distances through a force law , the distrbution of stress in the system is intimately linked to the underlying real space network and its constraints .",
    "in this section , we use the gauge potential formalism to analyse the response of granular packings to external perturbations such as an imposed body force _ while respecting the local force balance constraint_. in the presence of body forces , the continuum equation of mechanical equilibrium is @xmath35 .",
    "we generalize the height field construction , which imposes mechanical equilibrium at the discrete grain level , to this situation @xcite . at the granular level",
    ", the mechanical equilibrium condition with an imposed body force @xmath36 on each grain @xmath3 now becomes @xmath37 with the sum taken over all the contacts @xmath5 of the grain @xmath3 .",
    ", with external forces on the grains .",
    "to deal with the general case where body forces @xmath38 act on each grain ( represented with purple arrows ) , we introduce auxiliary fields @xmath39 that are associated with the grains @xmath40 .",
    "the contact forces are now given by the difference in height variables and a difference of auxiliary fields .",
    "for example @xmath41 . ]",
    "in order to account for the general case where contact forces and body forces are present within the system , we introduce an additional _ auxiliary vector field _ @xmath42 associated with the grain polygons .",
    "this serves to generalize the height construction of eq .",
    "( [ height_definition ] ) .",
    "since each contact has two associated grains and two associated voids , the contact forces are now given by the difference of height variables on the voids ( as before ) _ in addition to _ a difference of auxiliary fields on the grains as @xmath43 here the contact @xmath4 is shared between the grains @xmath3 and @xmath7 and @xmath13 and @xmath16 are once again ordered cyclically around the centre of the grain @xmath3 . it is easy to see that this definition satisfies newton s third law ( eq . [ third_law ] ) . in the absence of body forces , the @xmath44 field is identically zero and the above definition reduces to eq .",
    "( [ height_definition ] ) . as an illustrative example we consider the previous configuration ( fig . [ explanatory_figure1 ] ) with grain @xmath18 which is in contact with four neighbours @xmath19 through the contacts @xmath20 , with additional body forces @xmath38 acting on each grain ( see fig . [ explanatory_figure2 ] ) .",
    "the forces acting on the grain @xmath18 are given by @xmath45 the sum of the forces on the grain @xmath18 sum to the negative of the body force @xmath46 on the grain due to the mechanical equilibrium condition ( eq . ( [ force_sum_body ] ) ) .",
    "the difference of height fields around the grain @xmath18 sum to zero as before .",
    "the summation on the right involving the @xmath44 fields is simply the _ network laplacian _ defined , on grain @xmath18 as @xmath47 it is straightforward to show that this laplacian equation is valid for every grain .",
    "it is important to note that both the body forces and the auxiliary fields in the above equation are associated with the grains . in general",

    "the condition of mechanical equilibrium associated with a static granular system with _",
    "purely pairwise contact forces _ allows one to construct a useful representation of the forces in the system known as a force tile .",
    "this is constructed as follows .",
    "( [ force_sum_zero ] ) , the  vector sum \" of the forces on each grain , i.e. the force vectors associated with the contacts of each grain arranged head to tail ( with a cyclic convention ) , form a _ closed polygon_. this forms a  force polygon \" associated with this grain ( see fig . [ force_polygons ] ) .",
    "since the sum is taken cyclically over the contacts for each grain , we obtain _ convex polygons _ for frictionless systems . in frictional systems , the force polygons can be non convex and even self - intersecting making the graph non planar .",
    "next , eq . ( [ third_law ] ) imposes the condition that every force vector in the system , has an equal and opposite counterpart that belongs to its neighboring grain .",
    "this leads to the force polygons being exactly edge - matching , and one can then use this fact to tile these polygons next to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ force_polygons ] ) .",
    "this construction produces a network known as the _ force tile network _",
    ", with the edges representing the forces in the system .",
    "the two representations : force tilings and height fields defined in section [ height_section ] are related .",
    "it is easy to see that the positions of the vertices of the force tiles represent the height vectors starting from an arbitrary origin , since the vector distance between these vertices provides the forces ( in correspondence with the definition of the heights ) . since each face of the force tiling graph",
    "is uniquely associated with a grain , the adjacency of the faces is the adjacency of the grains in a packing .",
    "the adjacency of the vertices are simply the adjacency of the voids ( since the heights are associated with the void polygons ) .",
    "the force tiling representation has several intriguing properties @xcite , an important one being that the distances between the vertices represents a measure of the amount of stress between two points in a packing .",
    "the extent of the tiling provides the total amount of stress in the packing . since force tilings provide information about the nature of the stress distribution within a system , they provide sensitive measures with which to characterize stress induced transitions in granular media @xcite . in the presence of body forces",
    ", however , the force tile construction fails .",
    "this is because the force polygons no longer close as the contact forces do not sum precisely to zero .",
    "this makes constructing force tiles for granular piles and for systems with hydrodynamic drag impossible .",
    "soft disks with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions and high drag forces .",
    "the system is prepared with lees - edwards boundary conditions with a controlled shear rate @xcite .",
    "the viscous drag acts as a body force on each grain , the procedure in eq .",
    "( [ basic_equation ] ) allows us to uniquely determine the positions of the vertices of the tiling ( green dots ) , up to a global translation .",
    "these positions correspond to the values of the height field @xmath100 defined on the voids .",
    "the forces ( purple arrows ) are normalized by the average contact force in the system .",
    "the extent of the tiling ( orange box ) represents the total amount of stress in the system . ]    the laplacian framework developed in this paper can be used to extend the construction of force tiles for systems where contact forces are not the only forces in the system . given the contact and body forces in the system , by using the network of contacts one can construct the @xmath44 field as detailed in section [ response_to_perturbation_section ] .",
    "this then allows for a unique construction of the height field @xmath101 which are the vertices of the force tiling . as an illustrative example , in fig .",
    "[ bodyforce_tile_figure ] we show the force tiling associated with a dense suspension of @xmath102 soft disks with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions and high drag forces @xcite . in this case , the viscous drag acts as a body force on each grain .",
    "the positions of the vertices were computed by inverting eq .",
    "( [ basic_equation ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have discussed how stresses in granular packings are transmitted through the network of contact forces in response to external perturbations . our formalism allowed us to construct force - balanced solutions on disordered networks that respect _ vector _ force balance at the microscopic level .",
    "this new potential formulation opens several interesting avenues .",
    "the laplacian framework can be easily extended to systems where contact forces are not the only forces present in the system .",
    "this occurs frequently in systems with hydrodynamic forces , where viscous drag plays a major role , and granular piles in a gravitational field .",
    "our construction assumes that there is enough indeterminacy in the forces at the contact level depending on how a packing is created .",
    "this is particularly true for systems with frictional grains where an exact force law is not applicable .",
    "even so , the constraints that are left out of the analysis such as the coulomb constraint and torque balance would change the effect of the response . if we assume , as in the @xmath0-model , that roughness at the grain level would lead to an indeterminacy in the actual position of the contacts , then one can find a torque balanced solution as long as the perturbation is small enough , and the network does not rearrange .",
    "our construction therefore accurately describes systems in the infinitely rigid limit .",
    "generalizations of this procedure while taking into account more constraints would be an interesting avenue for future research .",
