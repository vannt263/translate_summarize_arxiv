    "nowadays the standard model is triumphant  the net result of high - energy physics experiments in the last two decades .",
    "the fact that for these stringent standard model checking experiments high energies are crucial is a natural consequence of the w- and z - boson high masses on one side , and of the asymptotic freedom of qcd on another .",
    "it is also true that the most part of the elementary particle physics community relates today further progress in the field to future experiments at even higher energies and is involved into the corresponding activities .",
    "nevertheless many interesting and important things can be learned from experiments at low and medium energies , where qcd , one of the pillars of the standard model , becomes practically intractable because instead of the asymptotic freedom we have infrared slavery in this energy range and consequently a breakdown of the perturbation theory .    for more than 25 years the vepp-2 m @xmath0 collider in",
    "novosibirsk operates in the center - of - mass energy range @xmath1 gev @xcite . until now",
    "its maximum luminosity of @xmath2 at @xmath3 mev is a record in this energy range . during this period",
    "several generations of detectors carried out experiments at vepp-2 m .",
    "much of current data on low energy region particle properties @xcite were obtained in these experiments .",
    "the snd detector , which calorimeter will be described here , is an advanced version of its predecessor  the neutral detector ( nd ) @xcite , which successfully completed its five - year experimental program in 1987 @xcite .",
    "it also has some common features with the famous crystal ball detector @xcite , but contrary to it has a multilayer structure calorimeter , like neutral detector , and consequently more tools for @xmath4 and @xmath5 separation .",
    "the three - layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter based on nai(tl ) crystals is the main part of the snd .",
    "it is optimized for investigation of radiative decays of @xmath6 mesons , and other rare processes at energy near 1 gev with photons in the final state .",
    "a good energy and angular resolution for photons in the energy range from 30 to 700 mev is essential for background suppression in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 meson reconstructions and for detection of photons emitted in radiative transitions between quarkonia states .",
    "the general layout of the snd detector is shown in figs .",

    "electron and positron beams collide inside the beryllium beam pipe with a diameter of 4 cm and thickness of 1 mm .",
    "the beam pipe is surrounded by tracking system consisting of two drift chambers with a cylindrical scintillation trigger counter between them .",
    "the solid angle coverage of the tracking system is about @xmath9 of @xmath10 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter surrounds the tracking system . outside the calorimeter",
    "a 12 cm thick iron absorber of the electromagnetic shower residuals is placed .",
    "it is surrounded by segmented muon system which provides muon identification and suppression of cosmic background .",
    "each segment consists of two layers of streamer tubes and a plastic scintillation counter separated from the tubes by 1 cm iron plate .",
    "the iron layer between the tubes and the counter reduces the probability of their simultaneous firing by photons produced in @xmath0 collisions to less than @xmath11 for 700 mev photons .",
    "each layer of the calorimeter includes 520 to 560 crystals of eight different shapes .",
    "most of the crystals have shapes of truncated tetrahedral pyramids . the total solid angle covered by the calorimeter is equal to 0.9 of 4@xmath12 .",
    "the remaining space is occupied by magnetic structure elements of the storage ring , mainly by quadrupole lenses .",
    "pairs of counters of the first two layers with the thickness of 2.9@xmath13 and 4.8@xmath13 respectively ( @xmath14  cm ) are sealed together in common containers made of thin ( 0.1 mm ) aluminum foil and fixed to an aluminum supporting hemisphere ( fig .",
    "[ cryst ] ) . behind it , the third layer of nai(tl ) crystals , 5.7 @xmath13 thick , is placed . in order to improve light collection efficiency and to separate one crystal from another ,",
    "each crystal is wrapped in an aluminized mylar .",
    "the gaps between adjacent crystals of one layer do not exceed 0.5  mm .",
    "the total thickness of the calorimeter for particles originating from the center of the detector is 13.4 @xmath13 ( 34.7 cm ) of nai(tl ) .",
    "the total number of crystal in the calorimeter equals 1632 with 3.5 t total mass .    during the crystals production their nonuniformity of the light collection efficiency along the crystal",
    "was controlled and only the crystals for which the relative r.m.s . value of this nonuniformity was less than 3  % were accepted .",
    "as number of crystals was large , special computer controlled measurement device was developed for this goal .",
    "a new `` quantum mechanical '' algorithm for automatic photopeak searches @xcite was used in the computer code for this device .",
    "the typical behavior of the light collection efficiency along the crystal is shown in fig .",
    "[ c1 ] for the first layer crystals and in fig .",
    "[ c2 ] for the second layer ones .",
    "crystals from the third layer are similar to the second layer crystals in this respect .",
    "the light collection efficiency varies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 for crystals of different calorimeter layers .",
    "the averaged efficiency for the first layer is 13% , for the second layer  17% , and for the third layer ",
    "18% .    as photosensitive devices for the calorimeter counters the vacuum phototriodes are used @xcite with a photocathode diameter of 17 mm in the first two layers and 42 mm in the third layer .",
    "the quantum efficiency of their photocathodes is about 15  % , average gain is 10 .",
    "crystals with lower light collection efficiency are equipped with higher gain phototriodes and vice versa .",
    "spherical shape of the snd calorimeter provides relative uniformity of its response over the whole solid angle .",
    "the range of polar angle coverage by the calorimeter is @xmath17 .",
    "the calorimeter is logically divided into two parts : `` large '' angles @xmath18 and `` small '' angles  the rest .",
    "the angular dimensions of crystals are @xmath19 at large angles and @xmath20 at small angles .",
    "the crystal widths approximately match the transverse size of an electromagnetic shower in nai(tl ) .",
    "two showers can be distinguished if the angle between them is larger than @xmath21 .",
    "if this angle exceeds @xmath22 the energies of the showers can be measured with the same accuracy as for an isolated shower .",
    "a high granularity of the calorimeter is especially useful for the detection of multi - particle events .",
    "for example , the detection efficiency for 7-photon events is usually close to 15% after all cuts needed to separate useful process from background .    for the trigger",
    "needs the calorimeter crystals are logically organized into `` towers '' .",
    "a tower consists of counters located within the same @xmath22 interval in polar and azimuthal directions in all three layers .",
    "the number of counters in a tower is 12 at large angles and 6 at small ones .",
    "electronics of the calorimeter ( fig .",
    "[ chan ] ) consists of    * the charge sensitive preamplifiers ( csa ) with a conversion coefficient of  0.7  v / pc ; * 12-channel shaping amplifiers ( sha ) with a remote controlled gain ; * 24-channel 12-bit analog to digital converters ( adc ) with a maximum input signal @xmath23 .    in order to equalize contributions from different counters into the total energy deposition signal and to obtain equal energy thresholds for trigger signals over the whole calorimeter ,",
    "all shaping amplifiers are equipped with computer controlled attenuators , allowing to adjust sha gain in steps of 1/255 .",
    "each sha serves one tower and also produces additional signals for the first level trigger , the most important among them is the the total energy deposition  analog sum of all calorimeter channels in the tower .",
    "other three logical signals correspond to energy depositions above 5 mev in separate calorimeter layers .",
    "csa and sha constitute calorimeter front - end electronics ( fig .  [ fende ] ) . the equivalent electronics noise of individual calorimeter channel lies within the range of @xmath24 kev .",
    "each calorimeter channel can be tested using a precision computer - controlled calibration generator .",
    "the amplitude of its signal can be set to any value from 0 to 1 v with a resolution of 1/4096 .",
    "the snd electronics is organized to provide necessary signals for the first level trigger ( flt ) .",
    "for example , the calorimeter shaping amplifiers are collected into 160 modules corresponding to 160 towers . from the flt point of view the towers divide calorimeter into 20 sectors of @xmath22 in azimuthal direction and into 8 rings of @xmath22 in polar direction .",
    "the following parameters are used for event identification in the calorimeter flt :    * total energy deposition in the calorimeter ; * energy depositions in certain parts of the calorimeter ; * number of clusters and their relative and absolute locations ; * existence of a tower with energy depositions above a certain threshold in at least two calorimeter layers .",
    "signals from 16 towers , forming two calorimeter sectors , are collected by iflt modules ( fig .",
    "[ iflt ] ) . for each tower",
    "two logical signals are produced : a `` soft tower '' ( ts ) with a total energy deposition higher than 25 mev , and a `` hard tower ''  the same as a ts but with energy depositions in two of three layers larger than 5 mev .",
    "[ calog ] shows the organization of the calorimeter logic module .",
    "two groups of 20 signals each from sectors at different angles , produced by the summation of tower signals in the polar direction , and 8 signals from rings  the sums of towers in the azimuthal direction ",
    "form the set of input signals for the calorimeter logic module .",
    "the ring signals and the partial sector signals from towers at large angles ( tsla ) produce the signal `` two towers at large angle '' ( tdla ) .",
    "the sector signals ( ts ) go to the address bus of 1 mb static ram , where the look - up table is stored .",
    "the information from rings contained in another 32 kb ram is added .",
    "so , according to the memory contents , the components of the flt defining the number of towers and their relative positions are produced .",
    "flt components can be easily changed by ram reprogramming .",
    "calorimeter is calibrated using cosmic muons @xcite and @xmath25 bhabha events @xcite . a fast preliminary calibration based on cosmic muons",
    "gives the constants for the energy deposition calculations in the calorimeter crystals .",
    "these constants are used to set computer controlled attenuators at such values for each calorimeter channel that equal responses of all crystals are obtained .",
    "this provides uniform first - level trigger energy threshold over the whole calorimeter .",
    "they also represent seed values for the more precise calibration procedure , using @xmath25 events .",
    "the cosmic calibration procedure is based on the comparison of the experimental and simulated energy depositions in the calorimeter crystals for cosmic muons .",
    "the detailed description of the method is given in @xcite .",
    "the statistical accuracy of @xmath11 in the calibration coefficients was achieved for about 1.5 million events collected in special data taking runs with total duration of 4.5 hours .",
    "after cosmic calibration the peak positions in the measured energy spectra for photons and electrons agree at a level of about @xmath11 with the actual particle energies ( fig .",
    "[ ggcc ] ) .",
    "the cosmic calibration procedure was performed weekly , between the experimental runs.for a one - week period between consecutive calibrations the coefficients stability was better than @xmath26 .",
    "changes in the coefficients were also monitored daily , using the calibration generator .",
    "they could either drift slowly due to electronics gain changes or show larger leaps when broken electronics modules are replaced .",
    "crystal - phototriode - preamplifier channel short term stability was also previously studied in series of measurements with a calorimeter segment by using laser - based calibration system with a fiber optics @xcite .",
    "light pulses from a nitrogen laser after distribution system was driven to both counter crystals and reference photodiodes which measure the pulse amplitude .",
    "instability shown by this laser calibration was about 0.4% @xcite .",
    "to achieve highest possible energy resolution , the precise off - line calibration procedure , based on the bhabha @xmath25 events analysis , was implemented .",
    "the calibration coefficients are obtained by the minimization of the r.m.s . of the total energy deposition spectrum for the electrons with fixed energy .",
    "the detailed description of the procedure is given in @xcite . to obtain the statistical accuracy of about @xmath27 the sample of at least 150 electrons per crystal is needed .",
    "snd acquires such a sample daily when vepp-2 m operates in the center - of - mass energy @xmath28 gev .",
    "the average difference in calibration coefficients obtained using cosmic and @xmath0 calibration procedures is about @xmath29 , while the @xmath0 calibration improves the energy resolution by about @xmath30 .",
    "for example , the energy resolution for 500 mev photons improves from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "the calorimeter energy resolution is determined mainly by the fluctuations of the energy losses in the passive material before and inside the calorimeter and leakage of shower energy through the calorimeter .",
    "the most probable value of the energy deposition for photons in the calorimeter is about @xmath33 of their energy ( fig .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to compensate for the shower energy losses in passive material and improve energy resolution the photon energy is calculated as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is energy deposition in the first and second layers of the central tower of the shower , @xmath37 is energy deposition in the first two layers outside the central tower , @xmath38 is energy deposition in the third layer , @xmath39 are energy dependent coefficients . here",
    "the tower means the three counters of the 1 , 2 and 3 layers with the same @xmath40 and @xmath41 coordinates and the central tower corresponds to the shower center of gravity .",
    "the @xmath39 coefficients were determined from simulation of photons with energies from 50 to 700 mev . for each photon energy",
