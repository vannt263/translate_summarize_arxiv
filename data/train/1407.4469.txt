    "for over a decade , there have been ongoing efforts to directly image young jupiter mass exoplanets still luminous in the infrared ( ir ) from their formation process .",
    "examples of such planets include 2m1207b @xcite , fomalhaut b @xcite , the hr8799 system @xcite , @xmath4 pic b @xcite , irxs j1609 b @xcite , hd 95086 b @xcite , and gj 504 b @xcite .",
    "beta pictoris ( hd 39060 ) is an a6v star located @xmath5 pc from earth @xcite .",

    "represents the earliest examples of using high contrast imaging to directly detect a circumstellar disk ( smith & terrile 1984 ) .",
    "the disk is seen edge - on and shows asymmetric structure that has been attributed to planetary perturbations @xcite .",
    "the planet possibly responsible for these perturbations was eventually discovered by direct imaging @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 pic b has been detected by vlt / naco @xcite , gemini / nici @xcite , magellan ao @xcite , and gemini / gpi @xcite .",
    "this has led to a multi - epoch attempt to understand the planet s orbital parameters and to discern if it is aligned with the main disk or the secondary inclined disk @xcite .",
    "the basic properties of @xmath4 pic b have been estimated using sed fitting of broad band photometry , resulting in an effective temperature of @xmath8 , with a @xcite .",
    "previous comparisons of the planet s bolometric luminosity and system age to evolutionary cooling tracks resulted in a mass from 9 to 13 m@xmath9 @xcite . using a cross - correlation technique and high - spectral resolution over a narrow wavelength range ,",
    "@xcite were able to measure the planet s spin ( @xmath10 km / s ) and detect carbon monoxide absorption in the @xmath11 band .",
    "understanding the atmospheres of these very young giant exoplanets is a challenging task because we have only a handful of objects to study spectroscopically .",
    "the theoretical models used to compute the emergent flux from these planetary atmospheres are often extensions of those generated for brown dwarfs , yet the spectra of the hr8799 planets exhibit significant differences relative to brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of @xmath4 pic b offers another opportunity to study the atmospheric properties of a young giant planet that is substantially hotter than the hr8799 planets .    here",
    "we present the first @xmath12-band spectral mode observations of @xmath4 pic b with gpi .",
    "an analysis of the orbital parameters using astrometric measurements from these data has been published in @xcite . in section [ sec : gpi ] , we briefly review the recently delivered gemini planet imager being commissioned on the gemini south telescope . in section [ sec : obs_data_reduction ] , we discuss the observations and data reduction used to analyze the spectrum with this new instrument .",
    "analysis of the @xmath12-band spectrum , along with existing photometry , is presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusions are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the gemini planet imager is a facility class instrument that was designed and built to directly image and spectroscopically characterize young , jupiter sized , self - luminous extrasolar planets .",
    "gpi was built for the gemini observatory , and installed at gemini south in the fall of 2013 .",
    "the high dynamic ranges involved in directly imaging extrasolar planets required gpi to be designed to pay special attention to speckle suppression @xcite .",
    "gpi uses different sub - systems to combine several key technologies into one instrument .",
    "the gpi adaptive optics ( ao ) system incorporates a large number of degrees of freedom and uses a spatially filtered wavefront sensor to enhance contrast near the star .",
    "gpi first light and commissioning tests demonstrate that the ao system lowers the total wavefront error from dynamic sources and quasi - static errors by an order of magnitude compared to earlier ao systems @xcite .",
    "the gpi ao system is composed of a low spatial frequency , high stroke , 11 actuator diameter woofer deformable mirror , and a @xmath13 micro - electro - mechanical - system low stroke , high frequency , deformable mirror from boston micromachines @xcite , with a 43-actuator - diameter region for high order corrections .",
    "light travels through a spatially - filtered wave - front sensor , to remove high spatial frequency signals that would violate the sampling theorem and be aliased as low - frequency signals .",
    "spatial filtering is implemented as a hard - edged stop in the focal plane before the wave front sensor @xcite .",
    "diffraction is suppressed by an apodized - pupil lyot coronagraph @xcite .",
    "a grid of narrow , widely - spaced lines printed onto the apodizer forms a two - dimensional grating , producing diffracted images of the central star in a square pattern .",
    "these four satallite spots allow for a sampling of the central star spectrum , instrumental , and atmospheric effects in the same image as the object of interest @xcite .",
    "a infrared ( ir ) calibration wavefront sensor was designed to suppress non - common path wavefront errors @xcite by providing feedback about these errors to the ao sytem . finally , the science instrument is a near - ir ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath14 m ) integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) with an imaging polarimetry mode @xcite .",
    "the spatial field is sampled by a lenslet array and then dispersed , resulting in individual spectra with a spectral resolving power r@xmath15 .",
    "the spatial plane is sampled at @xmath16 milliarcseconds per pixel @xcite . in first light observations ,",
    "gpi achieved a 5-@xmath17 contrast of @xmath18 at 0.35 arcseconds and @xmath19 at 0.75 arcseconds @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 pic was observed with gpi in the @xmath12 band ( 1.5072@xmath14 m - 1.7899@xmath14 m , @xmath2044 - 49 ) by the gpi verification and commissioning team on gemini south during first light and then during the first verification and commissioning runs on 18 november 2013 and 10 december 2013 , respectively . during the november observations ,",
    "32 individual 59.6-second images were obtained in coronagraphic mode , with the cryocoolers @xcite operating at a reduced power level to reduce the effects of vibration introduced into the telescope .",
    "seeing conditions were on average 0.68as measured by the gemini south dimm .",
    "as the observations were performed during instrument commissioning , various operational modes were used during a specific data set to evaluate performance of the instrument . during the december 2013 observations ,",
    "14 individual 59.6-second images were obtained in coronagraphic mode . for eight of the images ,",
    "the ifs cryocoolers were operating at full power , while in the remaining six images , the cryocoolers were operating in a reduced power state similar to the november observations .",
    "each image has a different spatial filter size & woofer integrator memory value in an attempt to optimize ao performance @xcite .",
    "immediately after the observing sequence was completed , and at the same telescope orientation and flexure , a single observation of the flood illuminated argon calibration source was taken to accurately track the shift of the spectral solution on the hawaii-2rg detector .",
    "the images were first processed using the gpi data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "the pipeline requires the location and spectral solution for every lenslet .",
    "these lenslet locations were determined by using a cross correlation of the single argon image taken during the observing sequence as @xmath4 pic and high s / n , deep images made during daytime calibrations .",
    "the telescope elevation differed between the science images and the daytime calibration sequence .",
    "the resultant shift was used to determine the overall change of the wavelength solution between the daytime calibrations and that appropriate for the observations of @xmath4 pic .    with a shifted wavelength calibration ,",
    "the gpi data reduction pipeline was used to reduce all images , apply dark corrections , remove bad pixels , track satellite spot locations , and convert each microspectra into a 37-channel spectral cube ( @xmath21 m ) .",
    "each data set was processed in an identical way .",
    "further data processing was done outside of the gpi pipeline .",
    "the gpi atmospheric dispersion corrector was not commissioned at the time these observations were made ; therefore , each image and each spectral slice are independently registered using the stellar position found by the four satellite spots .",
    "gpi is mounted on a cassegrain port with derotator disabled so each image has a different sky orientation . in post processing ,",
    "these images are rotated so that the planet has a fixed location .",
    "since the satellite spots are imaged at an identical time under identical conditions , in theory their psfs should closely match the planet psf especially when the four spots are averaged together .",
    "instrumental effects and atmospheric effects are estimated from satellite spot spectra .",
    "an 8000k , log @xmath22 @xmath23 bt - nexgen model @xcite convolved to the resolution of gpi , was used to approximate the a6v stellar spectrum of @xmath4 pic a. this allows the instrumental and telluric features under identical conditions to be estimated for the planet spectrum and removed .",
    "we found that the remaining halo in these initial first light images was smooth , and dominated by uncorrected atmospheric halo speckles , rather than quasistatic speckles . in order to remove this halo ,",
    "we fit a third - order spline surface to an aperture of radius@xmath2457.2114.4 mas centered on the location of the planet , which includes the space around the planet but does not include the planet itself .",
    "a psf , generated by the average of the four satellite spot cores , was scaled and subtracted from the planet position in parallel to the spline fit .",
    "this average psf of the four satellite spots was generated for each particular image and wavelength channel to which it corresponds this spline psf is generated to subtract the smooth halo and estimate the flux of the psf .",
    "a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization @xcite was performed to find the best fit of the underlying halo and the planet psf in each image and at each spectral channel ( figure [ fig1_2 ] ) .    we determined the spectrum using the flux of the psf component of the background subtraction technique of the spline fit @xmath25 psf to measure the flux from the injected reference psf .",
    "this produces a measurements of the planet s flux in each spectral channel .",
    "each of the individual spectra measured from the individual frames is independently normalized and combined together ( figure  [ fig : nov_dec_spectrum ] ) . to estimate the systematic errors and residuals , psfs were generated from the satellite spots , injected with a flat spectrum at an identical radius from the host star into the individual frames , and then reduced in an identical manner",
    "given that this is one of the first extracted spectrum from the new gpi instrument , and that the halo of the star has significant color variation , it is possible that the overall spectral slope has an uncertainty of approximately 10@xmath26 .",
    "the spectrum discussed above has an snr ( per wavelength channel ) that matches or exceeds most previous broad band photometry . with this spectrum , we can estimate surface gravity and effective temperature as well as search for molecular absorption features and departures from stellar abundances .",
    "the @xmath12-band spectrum has a clear peak at 1.68 @xmath14 m defined by absorption on either side . the location of this peak and the slopes on either side are consistent with water absorption frequently seen in brown dwarf spectra .",
    "based on previous photometric estimates of the effective temperature ( 16001700  k ) , the primary opacity sources across the near - infrared are water , collision - induced absorption ( cia ) from h@xmath27 , and dust .",
    "there is no evidence for additional molecular absorption ( e.g. , from methane or ammonia ) .",
    "the @xmath12-band spectrum has a very triangular shape , a hallmark of low surface gravity and further evidence of @xmath4 pic b s low mass and youth .",
    "the gpi @xmath12-band spectrum and existing ground - based photometry were compared to the model grids described in @xcite .",
    "an effective temperature of 1650@xmath1  k was found to best match these spectral data , in excellent agreement with previous photometric studies @xcite .",
    "the best matching model is shown in figure [ fig : spectrum3 ] and it agrees well with the visible to ir photometry .",
    "broad - band photometric colors , however , are only modestly sensitive to surface gravity , emphasizing the need for spectral data .",
    "our @xmath12-band spectrum , as previously discussed , has an triangular shape that sensitively depends on surface gravity .",
    "our best matching models have @xmath2 ( cgs units ) that , when taken into consideration along with the effective temperature of 1650  k , is consistent with evolutionary models between 10 and 20 myrs for masses between 10 and 12 m@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] compares the december 2013 @xmath4 pic b spectrum to those of other directly imaged planetary - mass companions : roxs 42b b @xcite , 2m1207b @xcite , hr8799 b @xcite and hr8799 c @xcite .",
    "all of these objects are reported to exhibit low gravity .",
    "roxs 42b b has a similar @xmath12-band spectrum as @xmath4 pic b , though the former has a slightly steeper spectrum on either side of the peak , consistent with roxs 42b b being slightly younger ( 510  myr ) or lower mass .",
    "the other three planets shown in figure [ fig : spectrum ] are all cooler than @xmath4 pic b by @xmath0 500k to 800k . despite this large temperature difference , 2m1207b and",
    "@xmath4 pic b have similar @xmath12-band spectra .",
    "2m1207b s @xmath12-band spectrum is shaped by a combination of low gravity , opacity from thick dusty clouds , and non - equilibrium chemistry that favors co over methane @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry is less important in hotter objects like @xmath4 pic b that will have large co / ch@xmath29 ratio , regardless of vertical mixing .",
    "consequently , despite very different temperatures , roxs 42b b , 2m1207b and @xmath4 pic b have atmospheres with similar dominant opacity sources .",
    "the @xmath12-band similarities between these objects supports the idea that @xmath4 pic b is low gravity ( and hence low mass ) and 1 to 2 pressure scale heights near the photosphere .",
    "the differences between @xmath4 pic b and hr8799 b and c seen in figure [ fig : spectrum ] highlight the spectral evolution of low gravity objects from high to low effective temperatures .",
    "the model spectra ( figure [ fig : spectrum3 ] ) , however , do not match the @xmath12-band spectrum particularly well . the best matching model under predicts the fluxes at @xmath30 1.7  @xmath14 m while slightly over predicting the fluxes on the blue side of the @xmath12-band peak .",
    "the net effect is a systematic tilt of 5 to 10%  between the model and the data .",
    "though a spectral offset of this magnitude may be present in the data , we found that most @xmath12-band spectra from a low gravity brown dwarf spectral sequence @xcite agree extremely well with our gpi spectrum . the best matching brown dwarf , 2m2213 - 21 , has a reduced @xmath31 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum3 ] ) and the red - optical through @xmath11-band spectrum of 2m2213 - 21 also closely follows the @xmath4 pic b photometry .",
    "like @xmath4 pic b , 2m2213 - 21 is a young object with low gravity features and is possibly a member of the @xmath4 pic moving group , at the @xmath32 level @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the gpi spectrum and that of known low - gravity brown dwarfs strongly suggests that our gpi spectrum is mostly free of chromatic systematic errors and the discrepancies with the synthetic spectra are most likely the result of imperfect modeling ( e.g. , treatment of dust clouds ) .",
    "such a systematic discrepancy in the model spectra could bias the derived surface gravity , but it is unclear by how much . allowing for a slight , @xmath33%  tilt in the model @xmath12-band spectra yields much improved fits , but does not noticeably change the resulting surface gravity .",
    "we present the first @xmath12-band spectrum of the extrasolar planet @xmath4 pic b from the recently commissioned gemini planet imager  located on the gemini south telescope  which began commissioning in the fall of 2013 .",
    "the gemini planet imager is a facility class instrument built to directly image and spectroscopically characterize young , jupiter sized , self - luminous , extrasolar planets .",
    "we find that the spectrum of provides a new and insightful look at the atmospheres of these high - temperature low - gravity objects .",
    "while the best matching model does not perfectly match the @xmath12-band spectrum , the spectrum is remarkably similar to the young , low gravity brown dwarf 2m2213 - 21 .",
    "we thus conclude that error most likely is derived from imperfect modeling of the atmosphere .",
    "with so few directly imaged planet spectra , the other known objects are estimated to be cooler then , and have a slightly different spectral shape .    currently , and in the near future , several extreme - ao instruments will be on - line with the capability to directly image the spectra of the extrasolar planets they find .",
    "while our @xmath4 pic b data only cover the @xmath12-band , gpi is designed to measure spectra from @xmath34 m at a similar capability as our @xmath12-band data .",
    "these spectra will further our understanding of these high temperature low - gravity objects .",
    "the low resolution but great sensitivity of gpi is well designed to identify and characterize low gravity young exoplanets , as is demonstrated in our spectrum .",

    "<S> gpi is designed to image and provide low - resolution spectra of jupiter sized , self - luminous planetary companions around young nearby stars . </S>",
    "<S> these observations were taken covering the _ h_-band ( 1.65 microns ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum has a resolving power of @xmath0 45 and demonstrates the distinctive triangular shape of a cool substellar object with low surface gravity . using atmospheric models </S>",
    "<S> , we find an effective temperature of 1650 @xmath1  k and a surface gravity of @xmath2 ( cgs units ) . </S>",
    "<S> these values agree well with predictions from planetary evolution models for a gas giant with mass between 10 and 12 @xmath3 and age between 10 and 20 myrs . </S>"
