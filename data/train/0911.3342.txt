    "it is well known that thermodynamics was first developed by carnot in 1824 to study the production and the transport of heat @xcite .",
    "however since the axiomatic work of carathodory in 1909 on equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , also called thermostatics , one has very often considered thermodynamics as a theory restricted either to equilibrium states or transformations from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state . since",
    "1960 stckelberg has consistently presented thermodynamics in a way similar to mechanics , i.e. as a phenomenological theory with time evolution described by first order differential equations @xcite . in his approach",
    "`` energy '' and `` entropy '' are extensive state functions introduced in the first and second law of thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore the second law consists of two parts , one related to the time evolution of general systems and the other to the approach to equilibrium for isolated systems . by analogy with classical mechanics , where one starts with",
    "the study of a point particle to investigate then a finite number of interacting point particles and finally arrives at continuous systems , stckelberg starts his study of thermodynamics by considering simple systems , which he calls `` element of system '' , for which the state can be entirely described by only one non - mechanical , or thermal , variable  the `` entropy '' whose existence is postulated in the second law  together with the mechanical variables .",
    "he then considers general systems made of a finite or infinite number of interacting simple systems .",
    "in such an approach thermostatics appears as a special chapter of thermodynamics just as statics appears as a special chapter in textbooks on mechanics .",
    "moreover it should be stressed that mechanics appears as a special case of thermodynamics where the mechanical observables are decoupled from the thermal ones .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate stckelberg s approach with some simple mechanical systems submitted to friction force . using the structural properties discussed below , and assuming the conservation of energy , we show how one is lead to extend mechanics to arrive at thermodynamics . in particular , following stckelberg",
    ", we formulate the first and second law as time evolution described by first order differential equations .",
    "these examples will be used to illustrate the evolution of mechanical systems in the presence of friction taking into account the thermodynamical aspects , since it is well known that the temperature increases as soon as friction is introduced .",
    "previous analysis in similar directions have been done @xcite .",
    "they differ from our approach in which we use observables defined at each instant of time and we use time dependent formalism to describe the time evolution .",
    "moreover we explicitly introduce the entropy concept and arrive at the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "it is well known that a classical physical system is characterized by its _",
    "observables _ , its _ state _ and the _ time evolution_. these three concepts are structural , in the sense that they can be defined in many branches of physics .",
    "the observables are those physical quantities chosen by one observer to study the system .",
    "the state at time @xmath0 represents the information hold by the observer on the possible values of those observables at time @xmath0 .",
    "the time evolution yields the state at time @xmath0 knowing the state at some initial time @xmath1 together with the action of the outside on the system at all times . in the following we consider only pure states , i.e. the state at time @xmath0 gives the precise value of each observable at this time .",
    "let us present the main ideas of our work .",
    "we assume that for every physical system there is an observable , called the energy , which is conserved .",
    "this means that the numerical value of this observable remains constant whenever the system is either isolated from the outside or submitted to passive forces only , i.e. forces which do not produce work , sometimes called zero - work force @xcite .",
    "example of passive forces are those forces whose application point does not move , such as the force exerted on particles by an ideal fixed wall , or those forces which are always perpendicular to the velocity such as the force exerted by a magnetic field on an electric charge , or a perfect constraint on the motion . in other words",
    "this assumption implies that the only way to change the energy of the system is by an action from the outside . in mechanics it follows from newton s definition in the principia that the only way the outside can act on the system and change its state is by means of `` force '' .",
    "looking at the system from a mechanical point of view , in particular assuming that the only action of the outside on the system is by means of force , it is immediately clear that mechanical energy is not a conserved observable when friction forces are present . therefore to have",
    "an observable energy which is conserved we are forced to introduce a new form of energy , namely the internal energy , and the energy appears as the sum of the mechanical and the internal energy ( recall that the mechanical energy is the sum of several contributions which appear in the form of kinetic and potential energies ) .",
    "then one finds that to define the state of the system we need new non - mechanical , or thermodynamical , variables . assuming the simplest case where it is sufficient to introduce only one thermodynamical variable , we take the entropy and arrive at the second law of thermodynamics : for an adiabatically closed system the entropy can never decrease .",
    "now that we have reached the conclusion that thermodynamical variables are needed to define the state we are then led to conclude that it is possible for the outside to act on those variables to change the state of the system , in particular its energy , without any force ; this leads to the concept of heat power , or quantity of heat delivered to the system from the outside per unit of time : it is positive if the system receives heat and negative if the system gives heat to the outside .",
    "of course in more general cases it will not be the only new contribution to the energy ; for example if we consider a car accelerating on an horizontal road it will be necessary to introduce a new form of energy , the chemical energy , new state variables , the number of moles of each elements , and new actions of the outside on the system , i.e. the transfer of matter from the outside ; in other examples we will be led to introduce other forms of energy such as nuclear energy and relativistic rest energy .",
    "in section  [ sect2 ] we present a simple frictionless mechanical problem . in section  [ sect3 ]",
    "we consider the more general case in which friction is present and we extend the mechanical scenario to a more general one leading to thermodynamics .",
    "section  [ sect4 ] is devoted to significant example that can be easily calculated and in which we can get an insight about energy transfer between two bodies in the presence of friction forces .",
    "moreover we calculate the time evolution of the temperature , of the entropy , and the heat transfer per unit of time between two bodies .",
    "this work is inspired from @xcite and a complete description of this formalism can be found in the original work of stckelberg and scheurer @xcite .",
    "it is intended for undergraduates with some knowledge of equilibrium thermodynamics as well as for all those believing that thermodynamics is restricted to equilibrium states .",
    "as we have personally experienced , the explicit connection between mechanics and thermodynamics used in the paper can provide a significant improvement in the teaching of thermodynamics in the time dependent approach with frictional forces .",
    "+ moreover , this approach clearly shows that the first law of thermodynamics is valid even when work is done against friction forces .",
    "the system @xmath2 is the union of a solid @xmath3 moving on a solid @xmath4 , which is maintained fixed by means of some applied force , as represented in figure  [ fig2td ] .",
    "this force is thus passive and has no effect on the energy of the system ( although it has of course the effect that momentum is not constant ) .",
    "the two subsystems interact by means of some internal conservative force @xmath5 ( which is represented by a massless spring in figure  [ fig2td ] ) and we assume that there is no friction force between the two solids , or with air .",
    "the mechanical state of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is given by their position @xmath6 and their momentum @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "since @xmath4 is at rest its mechanical state @xmath9 does not change in time .",
    "thus the state of the total system @xmath2 can be described by @xmath10 of the moving solid .",
    "+ to be explicit let us consider the special , but not restrictive , case where the force @xmath11 is given by an elastic force of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a positive constant .",
    "next we describe the time evolution , which follows from newton s second law and his definition of momentum , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass of @xmath3 .",
    "newton s equations are    @xmath16    this is a system of first order differential equations that allows to calculate the state at every instant @xmath0 knowing the state @xmath17 at some instant @xmath1 ( the initial data ) and the force @xmath18 : it is the determinism principle .",
    "note that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two independent variables which vary periodically .",
    "we finally switch to some energy consideration . from",
    "and we get @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 and since @xmath4 is fixed @xmath24 . from @xmath25 , it follows that @xmath18 is conservative , and we have @xmath26 we thus have conservation of the mechanical energy @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28",
    "if all the active forces ( i.e. those which produce work ) are conservative the mechanical energy , i.e. kinetic plus potential energy , is conserved .",
    "this means that the mechanical energy can be modified only by some external action on the system .",
    "this _ conservation of mechanical energy _ is a fundamental property since , using noether s theorem @xcite , one can show that it is associated with the temporal invariance of physical laws . moreover using the fact that at the microscopic level all forces are conservative , we want to assume that at the macroscopic level there always exists an extensive state function , the energy @xmath29 , which is a conserved quantity . therefore , assuming that the only way the outside can act on the system is by means of forces , we should have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the power developed by the external forces acting on the system .    the assumption is the first law of thermodynamics for adiabatically closed systems , i.e. those systems where the only external actions on the system are by means of forces .",
