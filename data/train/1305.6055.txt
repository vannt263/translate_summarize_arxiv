    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been proposed as a major source of high energy cosmic rays , provided that a substantial fraction of protons are accelerated in the inferred shocks or magnetic reconnection regions . however , the underlying mechanism of the prompt gamma - ray emission , the jet structure and the particle acceleration details remain uncertain .",
    "very high energy neutrinos , however , would be a natural by - product from high energy protons interacting with other baryons or with photons , suffering little from absorption effect along the propagation path and providing valuable clues about the presence of cosmic rays . it is expected that if a major fraction of the grb energy is converted into ultra - high energy cosmic rays , a detectable neutrino fluence should appear in icecube @xcite .",
    "however , the two - year data gathered by the icecube 40 + 59 string configuration has challenged this scenario by a null result in the search for correlation with hundreds of electromagnetically detected grbs @xcite .",

    "disappointingly , a neutrino search for this grb reported by the icecube collaboration yielded a null result . here",
    "we show that this null detection is not surprising , and show that it provides interesting information about the properties of this grb , some of which are otherwise difficult to obtain through conventional electromagnetic channels .",
    "we discuss the constraints on the physical parameters of this grb , both ( a ) using a model - independent procedure patterned after that of @xcite and @xcite ( section [ sec:2 ] ) , and ( b ) for three specific grb models ( is , bph and mph , section [ sec:3 ] ) , summarizing our results in section [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "we assume a simple grb jet model , whose lorentz factor averaged over the jet cross has a value @xmath6 at the dissipation radius @xmath2 . generally @xmath2 is model dependent and is a function of @xmath6 . however , in the interest of generality , in this section we do not specify the underlying models , leaving this for section [ sec:3 ] . here",
    ", the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath2 are treated as two independent variables . at @xmath2 , a fraction of jet total energy @xmath11 ( in the form of kinetic energy and a possible toroidal magnetic field energy if the jet is highly magnetized ) is dissipated and converted into energy carried by accelerated cosmic rays protons @xmath12 , turbulent magnetic fields @xmath13 and high energy non - thermal electrons @xmath14 ( the latter promptly converting into photons ) .    for grb 130427a",
    ", the photon spectrum is well fitted by a band - function spectrum with @xmath15 in the observer frame , where @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 mev , with a spectral break energy @xmath20 mev and a total isotropic equivalent @xmath21 ergs @xcite . for simplicity , in this paper",

    "here @xmath30 is the dynamical time scale and @xmath31 is the acceleration time scale in the jet frame .",
    "high energy protons lose energy in the jet frame due to @xmath32 interaction , at a rate    @xmath33    the second integral can be solved analytically for the broken - power - law photon energy distribution @xmath34 , while for the first integral is approximated using the @xmath35 resonance , in which , @xmath36 where @xmath37 gev is the peak of the @xmath32 cross section , @xmath38 gev is the threshold and @xmath39 gev is the width of the resonance measured in the proton rest frame .",

    "due to neutrino oscillations and the large uncertainties in the exact energy and distance of the source , we assume that they arrive at the earth in equal numbers per flavor .",

    "the neutrino flux @xmath68 in the observer frame is computed using as input the two free parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 on a @xmath69 grid , and this is then integrated with the icecube effective area profile at the source incident angle @xmath70 degrees to obtain @xmath60 , from an energy range @xmath71 gev which is sufficiently broad to cover the entire neutrino spectra discussed in this paper .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is represented by color . since @xmath72 by eqn .",

    "this is consistent with the nature of the @xmath32 interactions and the photon spectrum of this grb , for two reasons : a ) the wind comoving frame photon energy density @xmath75 decreases rapidly with @xmath2 and @xmath6 ; a low @xmath76 suppresses @xmath43 and thus the final neutrino flux .",
    "b ) the neutrino break energy , where the neutrino flux contributes most to the final @xmath60 in icecube , is proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "a higher @xmath78 is associated with a smaller contribution ( due to the effective area function and the photon indices for this grb ) .",
    "in this section we discuss these three scenarios , labeled is , bph and mph . after specifying any one of them , @xmath2 is derivable from @xmath6 and the other parameters , and hence one degree of freedom is eliminated from the parameter space . for the is model , semi - relativistic shocks are formed by the collision of two shells of different velocities .",
    "the dissipation radius is estimated as @xmath79 cm , where @xmath80 s is the variability time scale in milliseconds and @xmath6 is the averaged bulk lorentz factor of the two shells . for the two photospheric models , the dissipation is assumed to take place at the photosphere where the optical depth for a photon to scatter off an electron is unity @xmath81 . depending on whether the jet is dominated by the kinetic energy of the baryons or by the toroidal magnetic energy ,",
    "the photospheric scenario is either a baryonic photospheric ( bph ) or a magnetic photospheric ( mph ) type . for the magnetic type , the fast rotating central engine ( a black hole or magnetar ) can lead to a highly magnetized outflow which is initially poynting dominated with a sub - dominated baryonic load .",
    "if the magnetic field is striped , carrying alternating polarity and the jet is roughly one dimensional , the bulk acceleration of the jet is approximately @xmath82 until a saturation radius @xmath83 , where @xmath84 cm is the base radius of the jet and @xmath85 is the baryon load portion . around the photosphere region , we assume a major fraction of the jet energy ( whether baryonic or magnetic ) is dissipated , leading to proton acceleration , resulting in a proton spectrum @xmath86 similar to that expected from a fermi process , as is the case with the internal shock model , e.g. see @xcite . for most reasonable parameters , in the magnetic mph model we have @xmath87 where the jet is still in the acceleration phase at the dissipation radius . on the other hand , for the bph and is models , the dissipation radius almost always occurs outside the saturation radius , namely @xmath88 .",
    "the determination of @xmath89 is more complicated for photosphere models than it is for the is models , due to many factors ( e.g. @xcite . ) for example , the jet may be contaminated by the electron positron pairs which will substantially increase @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "a more realistic consideration should also include the fact that the dissipation can start from the sub - photosphere all the way out , until the jet is saturated .",
    "the magnetic field configuration is also complex ( e.g. the geometry of the layers , the reconnection rates etc ) which will eventually affect the proton and neutrino spectrum .",
    "although a multi - zone simulation is beyond the scope of this paper , it would be desirable in order to increase the precision of the neutrino spectrum .    in this section ,",
    "we have used a calculation scheme similar to that in @xcite .",
    "we make the same assumptions suitable for a one - zone calculation , but the consideration on the micro - processes is here more complete , compared to that of  ii , and is is based on a numerical code . the pionization efficiency is obtained by calculating all the leading order processes , e.g. @xmath32 ( delta - resonance and multi - pion productions ) , bethe - heitler , pp , synchrotron , inverse compton and adiabatic losses .",
    "the cooling of the secondary charged particles via synchrotron and inverse compton , and the energy distribution functions for the neutrinos from pion and muon decay are also included .",
    "the expected neutrino events detectable in icecube are plotted in fig.[[fig : f2],[fig : f3],[fig : f4 ] ] , for the three models separately . the asymptotic lorentz factor @xmath62 ( instead of @xmath6 at the dissipation radius ) and",
    "the ratio of accelerated protons to electrons @xmath10 are the two input free parameters .",
    "the calculation is performed on a @xmath92 grid for this parameter space for each model .",
    "the resultant neutrino event number , @xmath61 ( tracks only ) and @xmath60 ( track+cascade ) , are represented by colors .",

    ".    _ constraints on is models ( fig.[[fig : f2 ] ] ) _ : here we have used a variability timescale @xmath93 ms .",
    "this corresponds to a minimal dissipation radius @xmath94 cm which is optimally advantageous for neutrino production .",
    "a higher value of @xmath95 would increase @xmath2 and decrease @xmath43 and @xmath68 from those shown in fig.[[fig : f1 ] ] .",
    "thus , the constraints should be considered looser when using a higher value of @xmath96 .",
    "the results suggest that @xmath10 values from 1 to 10 can all be admitted , but for @xmath97 , @xmath98 is required in order not to violate the icecube null result .",
    "we note also that @xmath60 and @xmath61 increase when @xmath99 is lowered , but their values saturate at about @xmath100 and then decrease when @xmath101 . for @xmath102 , @xmath43 reaches unity and protons lose almost all their energy to pions .",
    "a smaller radius is associated with a higher energy density @xmath103 and @xmath76 , which causes the charged pions and muons to cool faster before they decay to produce neutrinos .",
    "a smaller @xmath6 value gives a smaller @xmath78 value , for which icecube has a smaller effective area .",

    "_ constraints on the mph model ( fig.[[fig : f4 ] ] ) _ : the most interesting constraints are obtained for the mph model . due to the nature of the magnetic jet , the photosphere , if one neglects the effects of @xmath107 formation @xcite , should occur in the acceleration phase for the likely parameter values . even if the jet is initially loaded with a small amount of baryons ( a high @xmath62 value ) , @xmath6 at @xmath91",

    "this fact is also revealed in fig.[[fig : f4 ] ] by the contours being almost parallel to the @xmath6-axis . the magnetic photospheric radius is larger than the @xmath2 computed for the is model with @xmath93 ms , but it is not large enough to suppress @xmath43 much below unity .",
    "the secondaries suffer somewhat less cooling from synchrotron and ic than in the is case considered .",
    "a somewhat lower bulk lorentz factor is also lower , which decreases the event number in icecube . ]",
    "is advantageous for neutrino production .",
    "therefore , the mph model generally has an equal or higher neutrino efficiency than the is and bph model .",
    "although the result is insensitive to @xmath62 , a relatively stringent constraint on @xmath109 is obtained for this burst , independent of @xmath62 or @xmath6 .",
    "for very low values of @xmath62 , there is also a  saturation effect \" for reasons similar as in the is case .",
    "we have discussed the implications of the non - detection by icecube in the gamma - ray burst grb130427a . using the results of the electromagnetic observations of this burst ,",
    "we have analyzed the implications of this neutrino null - result for constraining the physical parameters of this burst . using first a simplified analysis which is independent of specific grb models , we find that the null - result implies a simple inverse relationship between the bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 at the dissipation radius @xmath89 and this radius , as a function of the relativistic proton to electron ratio @xmath10 ( fig.[[fig : f1 ] ] ) , which suggests values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 cm .",
    "we then performed more detailed numerical calculations for three different specific grb models , the internal shock ( is ) , baryonic photosphere ( bph ) and magnetized photosphere ( mph ) models .",
    "we find that the is model ( fig.[[fig : f2 ] ] ) with the shortest variability time and the highest neutrino luminosity is able to comply with the null - result constraint if its bulk lorentz factor @xmath112 , depending on @xmath10 , a fairly modest constraint .",
    "longer variability times only weaken the constraint . for the baryonic photosphere bph model ( fig.[[fig : f3 ] ] ) the constraint for compliance is comparable , @xmath113 depending on @xmath10 .",
    "the most restrictive constraint is for the magnetic photosphere mph model of fig.[[fig : f4 ] ] .",
    "here it is found that , for this burst grb130427a , the null result implies an allowed value of @xmath114 , almost independently of the asymptotic bulk lorentz factor @xmath62 .",
