    "* ) .    and",
    "while these computational efforts have helped elucidate what must inherently be a complicated picture behind galaxy formation , there has been the unnatural side effect of rendering opaque to the general community the physical processes ( and their parameters ) that dominate how and why galaxies became what they are . in other words ,",
    "the progression of technologies and capabilities of simulation science has separated many astronomers from the core astrophysical principles that underpin modern visions of galaxy formation .",
    "so while simulations now provide detailed pictures , many confrontations of data with theory are executed with relatively simple pictures and models @xcite , with each turning on dramatic , life - changing events such as `` quenching '' ( meaning different things to different people ; * ? ? ?",

    "having an empirical picture , or at least one grounded solely in the data , would free the community from overly rigid assumptions , including those that underpin halo occupation distribution models or abundance matching ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and many others ) .",
    "however , deriving an empirical picture within the framework of ( @xmath5)cdm has so far not easily allowed for significant decoupling between stellar mass growth and halo growth , as implicit equivalence between the two is a major , unproven assumption in standard treatments of galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at best it is assumed that the diversity of dm assembly fully encapsulates the diversity in galaxy growth , but , again , the assumption comes with many caveats , remaining undemonstrated in its validity , and demonstrably invalid at late times , such as when galaxy groups grow through continued hierarchical assembly @xcite while their constituent galaxies grow more slowly @xcite , and while baryons retain the ability to radiatively cool with respect to the dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , empirical derivations of galaxy formation and assembly have also treated the mean evolution of ensembles of galaxies as representative of what galaxies actually do @xcite , an assumption that does little to help illuminate the true underlying distribution of growth histories , to say nothing of those of individual galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "even discussions of `` fast - track '' and `` slow - track '' quenching may be distinctions without a difference , as the time for galaxies cross from blue to red is always a fixed fraction of a hubble time @xcite . and if that means stellar population indicators provide very little information about galaxy formation timescales , the nearly 1:1 correlation between galaxy star formation rates and stellar masses @xcite also suggests that the processes of galaxy formation and assembly may also be largely scale - free @xcite .    and",
    "while simple models help to give insight into how and why galaxies look they way they do , @xcite remains a stern warning to this day against overly deterministic formation scenarios .",
    "such work demonstrated the potential , and potentially hidden , ubiquity of diversity in star formation histories . together with @xcite s positing of ( relative ) balance between the forces that make stars ( gravity ) ,",
    "the forces that bring fuel to make those stars ( gravity ) , and the forces that stars re - impose on their environments ( feedback ) , this might already have led us to a number of conclusions about the evolution and behavior of galaxy ensembles without adding many additional mechanisms . by now this notion that stellar mass growth occurs in states of quasi - static equilibrium , between the inflows that fuel star formation and the resulting outflows has been explored in great detail ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) . however , the extent to which diversity of growth histories and ( quasi- ) steady state equilibrium go hand - in - hand @xcite remains under - appreciated .",

    "we begin construction of a new theoretical framework for thinking about the evolution of cosmological galaxy ensembles . until now , there have principally been two of these : purely numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and many since ) .",
    "our derivations lie in a third vein , more aligned with a statistical mechanical approach . by positing that stochasticity and stationarity are basic principles underlying halo and galaxy growth ( section [ sec : terms ] ) , we are able to retain an analytic framework for describing the long - term behavior of ensembles , while avoiding a reliance on mean - based parametric prescriptions requiring fine - tuning . such an approach incorporates the dynamism of the ( our ) cosmological system , not only jettisoning deterministic histories for individual members of the ensemble , but explicitly refutes the notion that individual , deterministic histories may be written . by doing so",
    ", we are able to elucidate the full extent to which very basic phenomena ( e.g. , the matter power spectrum ) _ dictate _ the evolution of the full suite of early galaxy populations so as to define the emergence and behavior of the stellar mass function _ absent , effectively , any additional astrophysics_.    the goal of this work , then , is to show that galaxy evolution can be thought of as the stochastic , cosmological , jostling of ensembles of quasi - steady state systems .",
    "if so , we can bring to bear a wealth of mathematical tools developed to describe the evolving ensembles @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the power of this approach here by inferring the form and evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function over the first few billion years of cosmic time ( when fuel supplies are ample ) , but presumably far more can be examined in this formalism . as a side effect , this derivation  which seeks the `` equations of motion '' for galaxy ensembles",
    " will illuminate the critical role played by initial conditions , revealing how the matter power spectrum itself naturally imposes correlations between stochastic changes that ultimately dictates the shape and normalization of the stellar mass function without assumptions about sources of feedback ( e.g. , supernovae or active galactic nuclei ) .    in what follows",
    ", we adopt a hubble constant , @xmath7 ; a mean matter density of the universe , @xmath8 ; a cosmological constant , @xmath9 ; a mean baryon fraction , @xmath10 @xcite ; and a mean efficiency for the conversion of baryons to stars , @xmath11 @xcite .    in section [ sec :",
    "terms ] we define a few important concepts , followed by section [ sec : stoch ] with a brief review of ( _ in situ _ ) mass growth as a stationary stochastic process . in section [ sec : sigbar ] we derive the normalizations of the stochastic growth histories from the characteristic acceleration of baryons onto the seeds of galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "these ingredients are brought together in section [ sec : mfs ] to derive purely theoretical stellar mass functions that are then compared to data from the literature .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in this work we employ a number of terms , some familiar to the reader , but that have specific technical definitions that may run counter to one s intuition .",
    "the word `` stochastic '' has often been used in the astronomical literature as synonymous with `` bursty '' or `` random . ''",
    "mathematically , however , one should think of a stochastic process as very nearly the opposite .",
    "some intuition into stochastic processes can be developed by recalling the fundamental theorem of calculus .",
    "starting with an arbitrary continuous function @xmath13 , one approximates its derivative by calculating @xmath14/h$ ] for successively smaller values of @xmath15 , generating the derivative in the limit @xmath16 . in our case , however , one can think of a galaxy s star formation history as @xmath17 , writing down the star formation rates at times @xmath18 and @xmath19 as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "while your calculus instructor would have taken the limit as @xmath22 , we make no such requirement , and instead allow @xmath23 to remain arbitrarily large . as such , we allow @xmath20 , or @xmath24 in our case , to be non - differentiable ( yet integrable ) .",
    "the stochastic process is thus a discontinuous function , having no definable derivative .    in order to make progress on this general class or set of functions ,",
    "one _ replaces the property of continuity with a general description of the discontinuities _",
    ", e.g. by parameterizing the distribution of their amplitudes .",
    "( instead of requiring the limit of @xmath25 , we require knowledge of how big the jumps we encounter by _ not _ enforcing continuity are likely to be . ) when they have a normal distribution , for example , these discontinuities are referred to as gaussian noise ; _ the stochastic process itself is the integral of that gaussian noise , and is then otherwise known as brownian motion_. more mathematical descriptions and detail will be in the next sections , but so long as one can apply central limit theorems to the distributions of these discontinuities , one has access to the set of rules governing stochastic calculus : with limit theorems , one can derive probabilities for @xmath17 , and because these probability distributions are continuous in time , they are easy to work with . for most purposes ( including ours ) ,",
    "one simply derives the first and second moments of those probability distributions  referred to as `` expectation values . ''",
    "these often end up being relatively simple functions of time , and are typically what can be compared to observations .",
    "fundamentally , in a stochastic system , the _ ensembles behave deterministically _ , though their constituents _ do not _ , a fact that is critical to our derivations ( section [ sec : sigbar ] ) .",
    "this ( standard ) definition of a stochastic process stands in contrast to a common notion in astronomical literature that `` stochastic '' implies arbitrary levels of randomness , complete anarchy , or necessarily any level of general burstiness with periods of inactivity punctuated by periods of intense activity .",
    "a `` stationary '' stochastic process is one in which , given a complete , unbiased ensemble of histories , _ the arithmetic mean _ of those discontinuities , or stochastic changes , is identically zero at each instant of time . in other words , for a given object experiencing a stochastic trajectory , the value of the process is expected not to change from one timestep to the next .",
    "the _ average _ change , taking all objects in a fair ensemble , in fact remains zero , even though individual growth histories will wander ( a bit ) from the values at the previous timestep .",
    "one physical interpretation of this definition is that it is equivalent to quasi - steady state growth .",
    "when fuel for the stochastic process of stellar mass growth remains abundant , galaxies can continue growing with inflows and outflows in rough balance , in quasi - steady states , with no expectation for star formation rates to either go up or down , though they individually may .",
    "such an interpretation of stationarity is a natural way to connect earlier work @xcite , but not uniquely so .",
    "when the timescales for baryons to be converted to stars in galactic systems , or ensembles of galactic systems , is mismatched with the timescales driving stochastic changes to galaxy growth one finds that little s law holds @xcite strictly due to conservation of mass entering the `` queuing system '' that converts baryons to stars . as a result",
    ", the stochastic process of stellar mass growth remains a stationary one even when not in steady state equilibrium ( see appendix [ sec : app4 ] ) .",
    "additionally we can also write that the stochasticity is markovian when the discontinuous jumps in the star formation history for a given galaxy are uncorrelated over the lifetime of that galaxy .",
    "when this assumption is not valid , the stochastic process is non - markovian .    to be clear , this simply means that the changes in an individual galaxy s sfrs are correlated over its lifetime .",
    "the phenomenon of positive correlations between stochastic changes ( such that upwards `` bounces '' tend to breed further increases , not sharp declines ) has long been referred to as long - term memory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an attempt to describe how systems can experience state changes that alter how later events may physically manifest ( such as how two different galaxies can experience the same late - time accretion events but because their earlier histories are different , the two systems end up with physically different outcomes ) .",
    "the spectrum of covariance between stochastic changes is often described by an additional parameter @xmath26the `` hurst parameter '' ( see sections [ sec : meanevol ] and [ sec : hurst ] ) .",
    "published data on the star - forming main sequence strongly imply a hurst parameter of @xmath27 @xcite , implying maximal `` memory '' or longest - possible timescales of correlations between stochastic changes to galaxy states over the lifetimes of galaxies .",
    "such a value for @xmath26 can arise naturally in stochastic flows @xcite , but it can also occur when there are simply large scale ( or long timescale ) fluctuations in the fueling of the stochastic process @xcite , in this case galaxy growth .",
    "these sorts of climatic changes to fueling of mass growth may be expected from a cosmological power spectrum with density fluctuations on all scales , or at least scales that are relevant for galaxy evolution and structure formation .",
    "this statement will become important when we construct and examine the emergence and evolution of the stellar mass function in section [ sec : sigbar ] .",
    "here we review the mathematics that yields the long term behavior of ensembles of galaxies experiencing mass growth as a stationary stochastic process ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for this brief review of the math , we will assume a constant timestep @xmath23 .",
    "we use uppercase @xmath28 to denote the integer index of a time interval , and lowercase @xmath29 as the elapsed time since the process began .",
    "we will soon see that galaxies in our formalism are akin to gas particles in statistical mechanics : while , in principal , their individual behaviors can be described ( as , e.g. , in sams ) , doing so is not necessary to forming an accurate theory of large numbers of them that  critically  does not lose sight of their individual diversity . here",
    ", to be able to move to such a powerful description , all we need is a suitable _ form _ for the behavior of individual systems .",
    "it turns out that this form is quite general .",
    "the rate of growth in stellar mass , @xmath30 , for galaxy @xmath31 over the time interval from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is @xmath32 changes to these rates of growth can be expressed as @xmath33 , such that : @xmath34 akin to a second derivative .",
    "therefore , we have : @xmath35 @xmath36 can be assumed with no loss of generality .",
    "so far , equations [ eq : one ] , [ eq : two ] , and [ eq : three ] are straightforwardly connected to a traditional view of sfhs : they relate to the changes that actually occur from one time to another in an individual galaxy s sfr .",
    "now , we are going to make a conceptual leap . rather than approximating the _ individual _ sfhs as deterministic ,",
    "we allow them to conform to the general notion of stochastic as `` random '' processes ( or , later , quasi - random ones , with embedded correlations ) .",
    "as such , we will shortly lose track of the @xmath31-th galaxy  as one loses track of the @xmath31-th gas particle  but paying this price will grant us access to an expansive description of the galaxy population .",
    "the basic formalism for individual galaxies above allows us now to model the distribution of accumulated changes across time for the entire galaxy population as per section [ sec : terms ] .",
    "there , we introduced the notion that we are interested in moments of probability distributions at various instances in time  the `` expectation values .

    "now we impose the requirement of stationarity .",
    "this demands that the mean ( or sum ) of the @xmath44 terms at fixed time in the rhs in equation [ eq : stmean ] is _ zero _ : @xmath43 = 0 .",

    "in other words , galaxy @xmath31 , with its endless supply of fuel for star formation , is _ expected _ , to have @xmath47 , but this is certainly not _",
    "required_.    this is because the distributions of @xmath48 have second moments .",
    "that is , galaxy @xmath31 can experience an event at time interval @xmath38 that leads to a _",
    "nonzero _ change in its star formation rate from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "this is stochasticity ( again , see section [ sec : terms ] ) , and these changes occur with some variance @xmath51 = { \\rm var\\/}[x_{i , t } ] \\equiv \\sigma^2_{i , t } \\label{eq : varx}\\ ] ] as long as @xmath33 s domain is symmetric about zero , for a fair sample of systems , this will not violate equation [ eq : stationary ] .",
    "the value @xmath52 represents the width of the probability distribution of possible changes to the @xmath31-th galaxy s sfr at time interval @xmath28 .",
    "( recall that a stochastic process is one characterized by the distribution of discontinuity amplitudes , as discussed in section [ sec : terms ] . )",
    "remarkably , the only requirement we place on these galaxy- and time - dependent variances , @xmath53 , is that they be finite .",
    "_ so far in this discussion we have no requirement that we have any physically meaningful estimates for these variances . _ but because these are bounded ( i.e. never infinite ) we can define a root - mean - square , or rms , stochastic fluctuation over the lifetime of changes to each galaxy s star formation rates up to time @xmath18 : @xmath54 this number , @xmath55 , is thus directly related to the width of the probability distribution of star formation rates , @xmath56 , at time @xmath29 , and , modulo a factor of @xmath57 , informs the average `` bumpiness '' of individual galaxy sfhs ( prior to the epoch of observation ) .",
    "equation [ eq : sigbar ] implies that there are numerous paths to achieving the same value of @xmath58 , i.e. there are numerous ways for different growth trajectories to be characterized by the same mean variance .",
    "this is somewhat key : it both allows us to ( 1 ) define an ensemble of systems that achieve the same rms stochastic fluctuation at time @xmath18 ( or @xmath28 ) and so can be treated probabilistically , and also ( 2 ) to generalize our findings to any other such ensemble , independent of the actual values of @xmath59 .",
    "let us then refer to such an ensemble as @xmath60 , whose defining common rms stochastic fluctuation is @xmath61 .      for the galaxies in ensemble @xmath60 , we can derive probability distributions for star formation rates ( @xmath62 ) and stellar masses ( @xmath30 ) , normalized by that rms fluctuation , @xmath61 .",
    "if a given stochastic change to a galaxy s sfr is uncorrelated with every other change to its sfr , then , because sfrs can not be negative , the distribution of @xmath63 is equal to the nonnegative side of a gaussian .",
    "that must be symmetric about zero ( equation [ eq : varx ] ) .",
    "but when the boundary value of @xmath64 is enforced during the summation in equation [ eq : three ] , @xmath33 becomes a submartingale .",
    "] but if the stochastic change to the sfr at time @xmath18 _ is _ correlated with those at earlier times @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , then that probability distribution will follow a different form .",
    "fortunately , one can still derive the first and second moments of @xmath67 analytically , with an extra @xmath68 going into equation [ eq : sigbar ] ( see equation [ eq : sfr ] ) . here",

    "when @xmath76 , the process has long - term coherence , with increases in @xmath49 tending to be followed by more increases , and decreases tending to be followed by more decreases ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of long - term correlations , as mentioned earlier ( section [ sec : markovian ] ) , is often described as `` memory '' or `` persistence '' in individual galaxy sfhs , but this interpretation is open to debate .",

    "irrespective of the phenomenology of covariance between stochastic changes to galaxy states , equations [ eq : sfr ] and [ eq : mass ] are key outcomes of the underlying nature of galaxy growth occurring in states of quasi - static equilibrium with correlated fluctuations",

    "hence , equations [ eq : ssfr ] and [ eq : ssfrscat ] amount to functional predictions for the zeropoint and scatter of the sf main sequence that not only do not require , but are in fact _ independent _ of astrophysics .",

    "there is some flexibility given selection issues in the sfrd data , uncertainties in @xmath6 estimates from deriving stellar mass functions using rest - frame uv data at the highest redshifts , and cosmic variance .",
    "but , overall , our basic picture of stellar mass growth as a stochastic process provides as good a match to published data as can be hoped , given the extreme simplicity of the picture , and especially given the notable absence of astrophysical prescriptions for feedback and star formation .",
    "using the mathematics of stochastic processes , we conclude that :    1 .",

    "in these seeds , star - formation began in proportion to the second derivative of baryon accretion at @xmath114 ; 3 .",

    "_ in situ _ stellar mass growth then proceeded in manner consistent with stationarity , possibly implying quasi - steady state growth ; 5 .",
    "those @xmath62 states changed stochastically over time , but in ways that , for a given galaxy , were significantly correlated on the broad range of timescales as implied by the power spectrum of density fluctuations on all scales ( @xmath27 ) .    with only collections of stellar masses and star formation rates for fair ensembles of galaxies at these early times",
    ", our results would suggest that little else can be said about galaxy growth without more detailed observations on individual galaxies .",
    "our description of galaxy growth breaks the notion that there always exists a one - to - one mapping between halo mass and stellar mass . at @xmath114 , or at inconsequentially",
    "small times after @xmath114 , galaxies with low stellar masses do not correspond to low mass halos , but are better described as average halos with a low density of matter from which to accrete to build their halos and their stars . those halos",
    "start out initially with low rates of ( halo and stellar mass ) growth , rates of growth that persist on average for the ensemble of halos described by those conditions ( i.e. normal mass , low density ) . in this way",
    ", no tight stellar mass - to - halo mass relation should exist at these times .",
    "where ( normal mass ) halos have a low density of fuel ( also having a low density of associated dark matter for accretion ) , they have @xmath101 values that are low .",
    "the subsequent @xmath272 growth ensures that both stellar mass and dark matter mass remain jointly low for much of cosmic time .",
    "but those ( normal mass ) halos with a high density of material for accretion ( baryons and dark matter ) , have high values of @xmath101 , thus comprising halo ensembles that will grow rapidly in both stellar mass and halo mass .",
    "as these ensembles evolve , the future stellar mass - halo mass relation emerges , and emerges rapidly , because @xmath272 growth diversifies the low- and high - density populations quickly ( e.g. section [ sec : mgrowth ] ) .",
    "in other words , even if all halos at @xmath116-@xmath245 started star formation with the same halo mass , those with low values of @xmath101 would , on average , remain outpaced by those halos with high values of @xmath101 .",
    "the low-@xmath101 galaxies would , on average , maintain low stellar and halo masses compared to those that had a greater abundance of local material and thus high values of @xmath101 .",
    "by , e.g. , @xmath273 or so , a well defined stellar mass - halo mass relation should be in place .",
    "eventually ensembles with a high density of fuel , characterized again by high values of @xmath101 and subsequent rapid growth , will reach end - states ( e.g. exhaustion of fuel ?",
    "high entropy ?",
    "i.e. the second term in equation [ eq : d2mdt2 ] in section [ sec : mfs ] and appendix c , below ) more quickly than the halos that started out initially with a low density of fuel , being cursed thereafter with low mean ensemble growth rates to stay at the lower end of the stellar mass function .",
    "putting this all together , it is the distribution of matter densities described by the one - halo term of the two - point correlation function that drives the wide range of stellar masses spanned by the stellar mass function , and this wide range is frozen in place _ for each initial ensemble @xmath60 _ , in effect for all subsequent cosmic time ( until , e.g. , fuel supplies run out in regions of different @xmath274 ) .    0 more concretely , there are individual stochastic dark matter / baryon accretion histories in each ensemble @xmath60 .",
    "these result in stochastic sfhs , and , at least after @xmath114 , the dark matter accretion can each be linked to stellar mass growth histories through @xmath126 and @xmath275 at all times .",
    "but as far as the sfhs are concerned , the rate at which those later inflowing baryons are turned into stars depends formally only on details of the dark matter / baryon accretion at one instant @xmath114 .",
    "this is because ensemble @xmath60 was `` selected '' based on a common @xmath101 , and while these are defined as rms fluctuations , they act mathematically like terms of constant acceleration ( see below ) at times when fuel is ample . hence , the initial conditions determine everything about the future history of that ensemble , mathematically .",
    "a global stellar mass - to - halo mass relation emerges over time when studying all ensembles of galaxies  especially the centrals  because they will probe all the different start conditions available .",
    "the ones in dense areas will run away  in both mstel and mhalo  the ones in low - density regions will lag , and this will set - up a global mstel / mhalo relation , even though none exists for the actual common - sigma - bar ensembles in the sample ( which will probably not be identifiable ) .    in this paradigm density ,",
    "most notably density at @xmath114 , equals destiny .    , we plot the theoretical evolution of star formation rate density for the first 3 gyr of the universe using the solid red line assuming galaxies accrete baryons from streams with cross sections that are independent of halo mass .",
    "the dashed line shows the case for isotropic accretion .",
    "the solid black line shows the functional form of evolution from @xcite , where we use dotted and dashed lines to illustrate potential uncertainties in the sfrd evolution at levels of @xmath276 and @xmath277 dex .",
    "published sfrd data from @xcite are shown using the colored points .",
    "[ fig : sfrdevol ] ]      our formalism explicitly related stellar mass growth to baryon accretion , itself a process proportional to the dark matter accretion  all at a single epoch , @xmath114 .",
    "but if the constant of proportionality holds in some global sense over cosmic time , then the integral of @xmath278 at each redshift should be equal to the total mass of dark matter involved in making galaxies , multiplied by @xmath279 .",
    "interestingly , this calculation implies that all of the matter content of the universe has been involved in the process of making galaxies at about @xmath280 . by this time",
    "the universe should no longer be able to sustain unabated stellar mass growth and the above description of the universe , as a gigantic ensemble of uniformly efficient star factories must break .",
    "fortunately , the central limit theorem holds when a stochastic process is expected to be modified by long - term trends . in our case",
    "the radical redistribution of the fuel supply and/or the injection of energy and/or entropy into that material will modify long - term expectations , each with potentially different mathematical characterizations . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app3 ] , we expand on the notion of entropy as related to the number of galaxy states available to the system but note that a more thorough examination of how the system falters must be postponed for future papers .",
    "no doubt the spectrum of large - scale density fluctuations also plays a crucial role , as @xmath98 is shifted to larger values of @xmath101 in over - densities via the @xmath187 term of equation [ eq : deltasigdep ] . over - dense regions of the universe reach their breaking points sooner , leading the massive galaxies in those regions to their natural end states more quickly than those in lower density regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and leading to the hierarchical formation of galaxy groups in high density regions of the universe sooner than lower density regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see his section vi ) had suggested that the morphology - density relation may have originated because high frequency ( galaxy scale ) density perturbations were coupled to larger ( cluster / group scale ) density perturbations . here , we have derived just such a correlation between the values of @xmath101 that govern the rates of stochastic growth for ensembles of galaxies . while we couched much of our work in section [ sec : sigbar ] in terms of baryonic acceleration , it must not be forgotten that @xmath101 is also explicitly a measure of the rms stochastic fluctuations in the star formation histories of galaxies . in other words ,",
    "our derivations show directly that there can be no separation between the evolution of galaxies and of their environments : low- and high - frequency perturbations are inextricably coupled , and both drive galaxy evolution .",
    "large and deep galaxy surveys at @xmath281 , such as csi @xcite , z - fourge @xcite , gama @xcite , and the sdss @xcite will help constrain how one writes the long - term expectations at later times by matching the detailed dependencies of the stellar mass function , as well as the scatter and slope in the star - forming main sequence with galaxy mass and environment . with presumably some assumptions about how galaxy structure is related to phases of stellar mass growth  and therefore the accumulation of angular momentum ",
    "perhaps progress can be made towards something approaching a first - principles treatment of galaxy evolution that reproduces the many correlations of galaxy properties with mass and density over all time .",
    "the central limit theorem allows for probability distributions and thus ensemble expectation values to be derived for any galaxy property that can be described as a stochastic process . at the beginning of this endeavor",
    ", we wrote down _ in situ _ galaxy stellar mass growth as a stochastic process .",
    "we then explicitly related the form of the expectation values for star formation rates to the accretion of baryons onto the early seeds of galaxies . using this relation , we derived the evolution of the stellar mass function and cosmic sfr density at times when fuel for sf was abundant : @xmath282 .",
    "both reproduce existing data very well , especially considering that our model has one  and only one  free parameter : @xmath114 , the redshift at which star formation begins .",
    "we explored the dependencies of mean stellar mass growth on initial halo mass and on the initial spectrum of local matter densities , deriving the slope of the low mass end of the stellar mass function , and without the need to invoke systematic changes in star formation efficiency or variable feedback .",
    "we identified a break at high mass in the stellar mass function as arising from the smallest physical scale of density fluctuations in the nonlinear power spectrum , and derived a low - mass cutoff from the physical scale of turnaround radius for halos at the onset of star formation .",
    "together with the slope , these yielded the normalization of the stellar mass function in relation to the abundance of halos with sufficient mass to support atomic cooling and initiate star formation .",
    "these things were neither expected , nor derived previously .",
    "this work represents early efforts to derive an entirely new mathematical framework for exploring important aspects of galaxy formation and evolution , and without a heavy reliance on the typical parameters that historically require tuning in simulations or semi - analytical models .",
    "as such , future derivations of chemical enrichment , two - halo clustering statistics , and correlations of galaxy properties with the growth of structure , may then be significantly less dependent on assumptions that underpin previous galaxy evolution models .    of course inferring the physical manifestations of the stochastic growth we have posited",
    "requires both analytical and numerical approaches to galaxy dynamics , which have been occurring now for decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with exciting new analytical work on how stochastic effects drive secular evolution in disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the power spectrum of density fluctuations shapes the galaxy stellar mass function , as well as the rates at which ensembles of galaxies evolve , with stochastic changes to galaxy states correlated on a broad range of timescales . such correlations between stochastic events is often referred to as long - term memory , as if whatever happens to them early in their lives remains important in the distant future .",
    "some mathematicians argue that this phenomenon of long - term memory is merely the imposition of large scale , long - term fluctuations in the global climate on the underlying intrinsic stochasticity @xcite . for galaxies this may be a distinction without a difference : environment ( large scale density fluctuations ) acts as repositories of `` memory '' and actively drives climate change on long timescales .",
    "simultaneously , hurst parameters approaching @xmath27 naturally arise out of positive stochastic flows @xcite , bolstering work pointing to the importance of cosmic flows in funneling baryons into accretion streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the specific details of inflow , outflow , or feedback , i.e. sub - grid physics , may indeed be important for understanding why galaxies look they way they do and have the chemical enrichment histories that they do .",
    "however , in our view the detailed parameterizations of sub - grid processes are not particularly important for understanding the evolution of the stellar mass content of galaxies , aside , possibly , from conditions of quasi - steady state , a mean value for star formation efficiency , and correlations between changes to galaxy states on an infinite range of timescales .",
    "crucially , our framework would suggest that super - galactic and galactic scale phenomena can not be decoupled , but both depend fundamentally on aspects of the matter power spectrum established at very early times . as such , stochastic growth _",
    "can and will _ manifest in organized and coherent sfhs that depend on local environment .",
    "further , the permanent diversity of these sfhs will support the scatter in many scaling laws , including the sf main sequence and possibly the galaxy size ",
    "mass relation . and",
    "given the hierarchy of halo assembly out of the fragmentary gravitational collapse of cosmological volumes , the stationary stochastic process already quite naturally provides a framework with which to derive the accelerated evolution of some galaxy ensembles compared to others .",
    "put most simply : the growth of galaxies for the first few gyr of the universe could only proceed the way it did .",
    "it is not sensitive to the detailed microphysics that complicate the fine tuning of traditional astrophysical simulations , so long as stellar mass growth can be written as a stationary process to a sufficiently high degree of accuracy .",
    "again , the property of stationarity stems naturally from equilibrium frameworks of the kind discussed by @xcite and many since , in which star formation occurs in quasi - steady states ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) . when fuel is plentiful , the addition of new sources of feedback are not particularly relevant so long as galaxies are systems that , on average , figured out how to form stars without blowing themselves out or over - cooling .",
    "we have gotten very far , from very little , in explaining evolutionary trends in galaxy star formation and stellar mass , using only the expectation values of stochastic processes , newtonian gravity , and star - formation beginning in proportion to a spectrum of baryon accretion acceleration expected at @xmath11615 . the flip - side , however , is that we have swept aside the astrophysical questions that set @xmath275 , the underlying physics that is involved , presumably , in keeping galaxies in quasi - steady state , at least on some unknown timescale .",
    "ours , however , is a community deeply interested in such details , and we must continue searching for clues to constrain the astrophysics of galaxy formation in whatever data we can .",
    "unfortunately , the ensemble growth of stellar mass in the universe appears not to be suitable for this endeavor .",
    "what this ultimately means for astronomers interested in the astrophysical processes that change galaxies over time is that ensemble measurements  at as many epochs as one likes  are unhelpful at best , and detrimental to understanding at worst . for it has been the slow , steady apparent evolution of the properties of cosmic ensembles that has lulled us into forgetting",
    "how dynamic the cosmos really can be .",
    "many of the things we need to learn about how galaxies form , how they can change rapidly , and how they evolve secularly , simply can not be learned from comparing different samples at different redshifts with each other , whether selected by mass or by comoving number density , even if systematic corrections to these methodologies are made @xcite .",
    "the disconnect between what observers glean from the statistics of galaxy evolution and the obvious dynamism in hydrodynamical @xmath204-body simulations has so far not been bridged by interpreting the slow evolution of ensembles as representative of its constituents , and patching such approaches only serves to mask the underlying diversity in growth and assembly .",
    "fortunately , mathematical tools exist for properly treating that dynamism in the steady evolution of the cosmic ensembles of galaxies . the mathematics of stochastic processes is powerful , and provides a means by which to model the distribution of galaxy growth trajectories . with that knowledge , that is the ( full ) set of underlying histories that go into the making of a set of observations ,",
    "the community should then be able to utilize detailed , potentially very deep , observations on ( presumably small ) samples , with the explicit goals of illuminating the side effects of cosmic dynamism , by specifically probing the warping of disks , measuring the heating of velocity ellipsoids with galaxy position , tracing the dependencies of internal kinematics on stellar population ages , all together , and in conjunction with specific , representative , and properly - motivated growth histories",
    ". it will be such detailed observations and sophisticated modeling of physical processes that will allow us to carefully disentangle the processes that enable galaxies to dance between blowing themselves out or making it for the long haul .",
    "the first author thanks his family for putting up with particularly intense crankiness during this endeavor .",
    "gratitude for the first author s awesome , most bodacious collaborators , for they were patient with the fits and starts and hiccups along the way .",

    "in the case of isotropic accretion ( case 1 , @xmath135 ) , or at least accretion through fixed fractional covering areas ( case 2 ) , the spectrum of @xmath98 would have a characteristic value @xmath283",
    "our picture is moderately sensitive to the adopted form of the accretion anisotropy .",
    "figure [ fig : mfevoliso ] shows the model stellar mass functions for the case where the accretion occurs through a fixed fraction of halo surface area . in general , these do not match the shape of published stellar mass functions for high redshift galaxies and we attribute this to the nature of the accretion streams with respect to the halos initiating star formation .",
    "we here speculate on another aspect of the second derivative of the mean stellar mass growth of galaxy ensembles .",
    "the second term of equation [ eq : d2mdt2 ] is not uniquely described by breakdowns in the available fueling of star formation , as it is also proportional to the change in the log of the sum of the variances to previous changes to galaxy states . in other words ,",
    "the system s continued rate of evolution is dependent on the number of possible galaxy states , highly reminiscent of the notion of entropy for an ensemble in a statistical mechanical sense .    using @xcite",
    "let us define an entropy for ensemble @xmath60 at time @xmath18 : @xmath284 \\label{eq : shannonh}\\ ] ] then @xmath285 substituting , equation [ eq : sigeq ] becomes @xmath109_i = \\frac{\\overline{\\sigma}_{i , t}}{\\sqrt { 2\\pi } } t \\frac{d \\mathcal{h}_{i , t}}{dt } \\label{eq : entropy}\\ ] ] in which @xcite s entropy , no longer referring to ensembles of messages or strings of information , instead refers to the number of states and/or to the number of state changes accessible to galaxy growth trajectories .",
    "when @xmath101 is independent of time , @xmath286 and equation [ eq : entropy ] reduces to equation [ eq : sigeq ] .    at some point ,",
    "as the universe s mass distribution becomes ever more disrupted by the processes of gravitational collapse and dynamics , particular ensembles may reach a point where @xmath287 no longer increases as quickly as @xmath288  which is another way of stating that the number of accessible galaxy states encompassed by @xmath101 may become restricted .",
    "such an approach may lead us to find matter density thresholds ( in @xmath274 ) that restrict the availability of particular galaxy states in high - entropy regions of the universe , though this is unproven speculation .",
    "nonetheless , if such parameterizations were to provide the best fit to late - time data on galaxy ensembles , the concordance with @xcite would be remarkable .",
    "those authors determined that thermodynamic entropy plays a large role in diminishing on - going star formation in massive systems , restricting the precipitation of cold gas clouds .",
    "note , too , that this restriction on galaxy states and star formation occurs relative to the ( _ ex situ _ ) stellar mass growth that continues via gravitational assembly .    in practice",
    "there may be several reasons for @xmath289 to , at some point , grow more slowly than @xmath288 .",
    "the long - term stellar mass growth may simply decelerate owing to diminished availability of material . in principle",
    "this may not modify the underlying ( gaussian or fractional gaussian ) noise but may merely change long - term expectations in the mean , shifting the centroid of the probability distribution produced by the central limit theorem . or there may be physical processes , in specific later - time environments , for example , that restrict the possible states or state changes for galaxies .",
    "making these distinctions will require specific data to interpret the physical manifestations of the mathematics .",
    "fortunately for us , and the reader , the dual roles of finite fuel supplies and entropy evolution are well beyond the scope of this initial work and are reserved for later papers .",
    "stationarity naturally arises out of discussions of steady state equilibrium ( see references given earlier ) , but the condition of steady - state is not technically required in order for us to represent stellar mass growth as a stationary stochastic process .",
    "the queueing of material for star formation implies stationarity at least on cosmologically short timescales through little s law ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even when systems are in unsteady states .",
    "little s law is essentially a restatement of conservation of mass for queueing systems . in our case",
    ", we have the stochastic arrival of baryons into a system providing a `` service : '' the conversion of baryons to stars .",
    "that service , proceeding at a roughly fixed rate ( at least in relation to a free - fall time * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is a bottleneck in the process of _ in situ _ stellar mass growth in that it is a step intermediate between baryon accretion and star formation .",
    "so long as all baryons slated for that service are converted to stars in the bookkeeping ( i.e. the mean efficiency remains unchanged with time ) , then little s law holds , and we can adopt stationarity without the explicit requirement of ( quasi-)steady states .",
    "one might also consider whether published analytical forms for dark matter accretion rates of halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might inform us of the appropriate second derivatives .",
    "surely the time derivative of such parameterizations , at @xmath114 , for a given halo mass should be all that is required . unfortunately ( or fortunately , depending on your perspective ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in prep ) show that the growth trajectories implied by published accretion rates have derivatives consistent with dark matter halo growth as its own stationary stochastic process that begins at earlier epochs , when specific modes of the power spectrum reach @xmath290 and transition to nonlinear growth .",
    "put more simply , the mean rates of growth for ensembles of halos were defined by the density field at much earlier times than the epochs we are concerned with here , the epochs when ( sustained ) star formation begins .",
    "the mean growth of dark matter halos track equation [ eq : mass1 ] but the clock for the ensemble defined by a given wavenumber is not synchronized with the clock that starts when star formation begins . and while delving into the nonlinear growth of halos at early times is beyond the scope of this paper , it is the focus of ( * ? ? ? * in prep ) along with a demonstration of the extent to which the equations worked through in this paper are valid for the stochastic process of dark matter accretion ."

    "<S> here we explore the evolution of galaxy ensembles at early times by writing the _ in situ _ stellar mass growth of galaxies purely as a stationary stochastic ( e.g. , quasi - steady state ) process . by combining the mathematics of such processes with newtonian gravity and a mean local star formation efficiency , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the stellar mass evolution of galaxy ensembles is directly related to the average acceleration of baryons onto dark matter halos at the onset of star formation , with explicit dependencies on initial local matter densities and halo mass . </S>",
    "<S> the density term specifically implies more rapid average rates of growth in higher density regions of the universe compared to low density regions , i.e. , assembly bias . with this framework , using standard cosmological parameters , a mean star formation efficiency derived by other authors , and knowledge of the shape of the cosmological matter power spectrum at small scales , we analytically derive ( 1 ) the characteristic stellar masses of galaxies ( @xmath0 ) , ( 2 ) the power - law low - mass slope ( @xmath1 ) and normalization ( @xmath2 ) of the stellar mass function , and ( 3 ) the evolution of the stellar mass function in time over @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the rise in the cosmic star formation rate density over these epochs , while the universe can sustain unabated fueling of star formation , also emerges naturally . </S>",
    "<S> all of our findings are consistent with the deepest available data , including the expectation of @xmath4 ; i.e. , a stellar mass function low - mass slope that is notably shallower than that of the halo mass function , and with no systematic deviations from a mean star formation efficiency with density or mass , nor any explicit , additional feedback mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> these derivations yield a compelling richness and complexity but also show that very few astrophysical details are required to understand the evolution of cosmic ensemble of galaxies at early times . </S>"
