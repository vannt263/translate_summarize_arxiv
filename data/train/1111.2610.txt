    "electroproduction of mesons in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , is a modern tool which permits to study the structure of the nucleon on the partonic level .",
    "exclusive channels in dis are of particular importance . for instance , arguments based on asymptotic qcd predict that the transverse component of the cross section for the exclusive reaction @xmath4 falls off with @xmath5 while the longitudinal component falls with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "exclusive pion production can be used to check this prediction and to determine in which kinematical regime these simple scaling laws become effective . in the following we discuss these reactions ; we draw here on our publications @xcite where further details can be found .    at jefferson laboratory ( jlab )",
    "the exclusive reaction @xmath4 has been investigated for a range of photon virtualities up to @xmath7  gev@xmath8 at an invariant mass of the @xmath9 system around the onset of deep ",
    "inelastic regime , @xmath10  gev  @xcite .",
    "a separation of the cross section into the transverse @xmath11 and longitudinal @xmath12 components has been performed .",
    "the data show that @xmath11 is large at jlab energies  @xcite . at @xmath13",
    "gev@xmath8 @xmath11 is by about a factor of two larger than @xmath12 , contrary to the qcd - based expectations , and at @xmath14  gev@xmath8 it has same size as @xmath12 .",
    "previous measurements at values of @xmath15  gev@xmath8  @xcite show a similar problem in the understanding of @xmath11 . even at smaller jlab  @xcite and much higher cornell  @xcite and desy  @xcite values of @xmath16",
    "there is a disagreement between the scaling expectations and experimental data .",
    "the longitudinal cross section @xmath12 is well understood in terms of the pion quasi  elastic knockout mechanism  @xcite because of the pion pole at low @xmath17 .",
    "this makes it possible to study the charge form factor of the pion at momentum transfer much bigger than in the scattering of pions from atomic electrons  @xcite .",
    "however , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on such a picture and which is generally considered to be a guideline for the experimental analysis and extraction of the pion form factor , underestimates largely the trasnverse response @xmath11 at high values of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can be represented by the three amplitudes shown in fig .  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the leftmost reggeized @xmath18-channel term dominates the longitudinal strength which thus always dominates at forward momenta , with relatively small contributions from vector meson exchange ( middle graph ) .",
    "the right graph , involving a nucleon - pole @xmath19-channel diagram , is necessary for gauge invariance ; its main , but small , contribution is to the transverse cross section . at the kinematics of the relevant electroproduction experiments the energies are high enough to excite also nucleon resonances ;",
    "the invariant masses of the @xmath20 system are between approximately 2 and 4 gev .",
    "we identify these high - lying resonances with partonic excitations leading to dis @xcite and invoke the correspondence principle in going from an inclusive final dis state to the exclusive pion production  @xcite . during this transition",
    "the transverse strength of dis remains intact .",
    "we thus expect that the inclusion of these resonance excitations into the @xmath19-channel diagram enhances the transverse scattering while leaving the longitudinal strength originating in the @xmath18-channel diagram intact .",
    "the resonance excitations are also @xmath19-channel contributions which  because of their special coupling  are gauge invariant by themselves @xcite . adding such a resonance ( dis ) contributions to the born term in the model of @xcite constitutes the central point of our model which also contains an improved treatment of gauge invariance accounting for the difference in the electromagnetic form factors for pions and proton  @xcite .     the @xmath16 dependence of the absolute value of the transition form factor @xmath21 in eq .

    "( [ sumres ] ) .",
    "our aim is to maintain the transverse character of dis , which follows from a parton picture , when going to the exclusive limit of a resonance decay .",
    "we thus have to establish a connection between these two pictures .",
    "bloom and gilman @xcite ( bg ) have shown that the total dis strength follows closely the average behavior of nucleon resonances ( for a more recent review see also @xcite ) .",
    "we , therefore , now use this bg duality in its local form @xmath54 where @xmath34 stands for the bjorken scaling variable and the deep inelastic structure function @xmath55 is expressed as a sum of resonances .",
    "@xmath56 defines the @xmath57th resonance contribution to the @xmath58 forward scattering amplitude ; it is essentially the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath46 times the resonance form factor @xmath59 .",
    "( [ bg ] ) links the partonic content of nucleon resonances with their hadronic structure . since the density of resonances in eq .",
    "( [ sumres ] ) is a steeply increasing function of invariant mass , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) that the electromagnetic coupling to nucleon resonances must be decreasing with mass since @xmath60 is finite .",
    "this leads to a natural cut - off for the number of resonances and makes the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sumres ] ) finite .    in a further step the combined nucleon - resonance contribution to the s - channel",
    "is absorbed into an effective born - term with a nucleon pole only , but a modified form factor @xmath61 which now contains all the effects of the resonances @xmath62 parameterizing the form factor in a dipole form leads to the conclusion that the cut - off must increase with the mass of the resonance , a result that is well known from early studies of bg duality  @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , expect that the effective form factor @xmath61 is considerably harder than that of the nucleon alone .",
    "this is indeed born out by the calculations as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f1onoff ] .    in fig .",
    "[ dutta1 ] we compare the result of our calculations with the @xmath24 data from jlab  @xcite for unseparated cross sections @xmath63 , at values of @xmath64  gev and for different values of @xmath65 bins .",
    "the square symbols connected by solid lines describe the model results .",
    "the discontinuities in the curves result from the different values of @xmath26 for the various @xmath17 bins .",
    "the data are very well reproduced by the present model in the measured @xmath16 range from @xmath66  gev@xmath8 up to @xmath67  gev@xmath8 . in fig .",
    "[ dutta1 ] we also show the contributions of the longitudinal @xmath27 ( dash - dotted curves ) and transverse @xmath28 ( dashed curves ) cross sections to the total unseparated cross sections ( solid curves ) for the lowest and highest average values of @xmath29  gev@xmath8 and @xmath30  gev@xmath8 .",
    "the cross sections at high values of @xmath16 are flat and totally transverse . at",
    "forward angles a strong peaking of the cross section at @xmath29  gev@xmath8 comes from the large longitudinal component in this case .",
    "the off - forward region is transverse .",
    "this behavior agrees with the results from  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the same behavior is observed in the dis regime at hermes  @xcite where the value of @xmath43 is higher . at hermes , because of the regge shrinkage of the @xmath25-reggeon exchange and smaller transverse component , the forward peak just has a steeper @xmath17-dependence  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ effhermes ] we show that , indeed , this very same picture also works remarkably well at the much higher momentum transfers @xmath16 and invariant masses @xmath43 reached in the hermes experiment @xcite . even in the kinematical windows",
    "@xmath68 gev@xmath8 the difference between the dash - dash - dotted curve ( no resonance contributions ) and the dashed curve ( resonances included ) shows the dramatic impact of the resonance contributions which are essential in describing the cross section at larger @xmath17 . just contrary to the situation in the jlab experiment the longitudinal cross section at hermes determines the total differential cross section at small @xmath17 .",
    "as the hermes kinematics are quite close to those expected for jlab at 12 gev we predict that again high - lying resonances determine the transverse cross sections at larger @xmath17 . in fig .  23 in ref .",
    "@xcite detailed predictions for the @xmath69 separated cross sections are given both for @xmath70 and @xmath71 production .",
    "in particular we predict that @xmath71 production is largely longitudinal .",
    "[ horn1 ] shows the results of the calculations in comparison with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite for all four separated cross sections .",
    "the solid lines that represent the results of our calculations describe all cross sections , the longitudinal , the transverse and the interference ones , very well .",
    "the transverse strength is nearly entirely built up by the resonance contributions that are considerably bigger and fall off much more weakly with @xmath16 than the ones obtained from the nucleon born term alone ( see fig .",
    "[ f1onoff ] ) .",
    "the resonances also contribute about 30% to the longitudinal cross section at forward angles ( small @xmath17 ) where the major contribution comes from the @xmath18-channel graph with the nucleon born term alone .",
    "for the interference cross sections @xmath72 and @xmath73 the sign even changes when the resonances are taken into account .",
    "this model has recently been extended to the photo- and electroproduction of @xmath74 @xcite ; again a very good description of all available data is reached without any new parameters . the transition from photoproduction ( @xmath75 )",
    "to electroproduction shows that the resonance contributions assume a larger and larger role with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "while at the photon point they just fill in the diffractive dip in the otherwise regge - dominated cross section at higher @xmath16 they become more and more dominant .",
    "the large transverse strength observed in various experiments on exclusive pion production has been a long - standing puzzle .",
    "we have resolved this open problem by adding to the usual @xmath18__-channel + born _ _ term description the contribution of high - lying nucleon resonances as an effective description of dis excitations . by using quark - hadron duality we have been able to link the properties of these resonances to the partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus treat this contribution to the exclusive production as the limiting case of inclusive dis processes  @xcite that are predominantly transverse .",
    "such a model , that makes use only of quite general average properties of nucleon resonances , is able to describe all the available exclusive electroproduction data for pions .",
    "in particular the transverse response of nucleons is determined by their resonance / parton excitations .",
    "a discussion of the relevance of the present results for color transparency measurements in exclusive electroproduction of pions off nuclear can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this work has been supported by dfg through the tr16 and by bmbf ."
