    "the superflow through solid 4 observed first in the umass group @xcite and then confirmed by other groups @xcite is now at the focus of the experimental and theoretical efforts in the field of superfluidity and quantum crystals .",
    "one of the striking features is the syringe effect ( or the giant isochoric compressibility ) @xcite . in its essence ,",
    "a solid exhibits the response on external chemical potential applied at a point , practically , the same way as liquid does  absorbs or expels a macroscopic fraction of atoms .",
    "as it has been suggested in ref.@xcite , this effect can be associated with the so called superclimb of edge dislocations  the climb supported by the superfluid transport along dislocation core .",
    "the unusual feature of this scenario is that the linearized isochoric compressibility of a solid permeated by a network of dislocations with superfluid core is independent of density of the superclimbing dislocations and is , instead , determined by the dimensionless parameter  the asymmetry between lengths of superclimbing and non - superclimbing parts .",
    "this implies that the effect is strongly non - perturbative , that is , it can not be treated as a small correction with respect to dislocation density .",
    "in particular , as shown in ref.@xcite , the linear isochoric compressibility of a symmetric network is essentially the same as that of a liquid . here",
    "we show that , even if the initial network is strongly asymmetric in favor of the non - superclimbing ( superfluid ) dislocations , there are scenarios still leading to the giant isochoric compressibility .        , according to the bardeen - herring mechanism : an originally straight edge segment ab ( solid horizontal line ) bows under the bias ( dashed - double - dotted line ) . then , further bowing results in the overhangs ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the points c , c in the overhangs approach each other and eventually the whole prismatic loop detaches from the points a , b . ]    according to the suggestion @xcite the vycor `` electrodes '' are creating a contact between superfluid reservoirs and a preexisting static network of dislocations with superfluid cores .",
    "such dislocations are characterized by burgers vector along the main symmetry axis and can be of two basic types ",
    "screw @xcite and edge @xcite ( as well as of the mixed type ) .",
    "the edge part of the network can execute superclimb responsible for the syringe effect .",
    "an example of such a network with combined segments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_s ] .",
    "there is an alternative to the `` preexisting static network '' scenario  a dynamical network which is created and disrupted by the external bias @xmath0 . here",
    "the analysis of the superclimb is extended beyond the linear response considered in ref.@xcite , and it is shown that a segment of a rough superclimbing dislocation is unstable with respect to its unlimited growth , if the bias by chemical potential @xmath0 exceeds a threshold @xmath1 which is inversely proportional to a length @xmath2 of the segment . in high quality crystals typical value of @xmath2 can be as large as several @xmath0 m or a fraction of mm or even reach a sample size .",
    "thus , the threshold can be _ macroscopically _ small , so that it may well be exceeded by several orders of magnitude in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a generic situation is that a number of the conducting pathways is @xmath3 , so that , in order to detect the superflow , the bias @xmath0 needs to be increased at least as @xmath4 which leads to @xmath5 .",
    "it will also be shown that a straight screw dislocation ( which can not perform superclimb ) with superfluid core @xcite can develop a helical instability under the bias so that the edge - like rim is formed and , accordingly , the syringe effect will also be induced .",
    "the threshold for this instability has the same dependence @xmath6 on length of the screw dislocation.[helical screw dislocations have been first observed in silicon at high temperatures @xcite ] .",
    "the instability has two important consequences : first , rough superclimbing segments of dislocations pinned inside solid 4 bulk can generate prismatic loops upon bias @xmath0 in a manner very similar to the frank - reed source of gliding dislocation loops under shear stress @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the generated loops during the superclimbing instability carry extra matter or vacancies .",
    "[ in this case the instability should rather be called as bardeen - herring @xcite ] .",
    "a typical diameter of the loop is determined by the original length of the edge segment @xmath7 .",
    "this process is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figfr ] .",
    "second , superclimbing dislocations existing at a solid - vycor boundary can proliferate into the bulk upon applying the bias , so that a percolating network of superfluid pathways is created even if it did nt exist originally .",
    "this process is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] .",
    "both effects are symmetric with respect to the sign of the bias @xmath0 . in one case an additional matter is injected into the solid in the form of parts of extra basal planes , and in the second  existing basal planes are being dissolved , that is , vacancies are being injected instead .",
    "the presented analysis is conducted at the level of a single dislocation .",
    "it ignores how pinning by 3 impurities or crosslinks with other dislocations may affect the dynamics of the instability .",
    "it is clear that the instability may also result in the dislocations exiting the solid from its edges .",
    "several growing segments may also merge or recombine .",
    "these processes as well as the interaction between superclimbing and basal plane gliding dislocations are also not considered . in some sense",
    "the analysis presented here is limited by low density of superclimbing dislocations so that there is some reasonably long time during which the dynamics can be treated within an approximation of a single dislocation segment .",
    "this situation is different from the linearized approach @xcite where the main assumption was that a typical distance between superclimbing segments is of the same order as a typical length of the each segment .",
    "the single loop strongly non - linear dynamics considered here relies on a different limit  that is , a typical distance between superclimbing segments is much larger than @xmath8 .",
    "the injection of the dislocations from the vycor - solid boundary and the bardeen - herring type loop generation as well as the helical instability of screw dislocations result in the syringe effect .",
    "the dynamics of the instabilities , however , turn out to be different : while in the case of the boundary instability the injected dislocation can grow to sizes far exceeding its original length @xmath7 , in the case of the bardeen - herring type instability the generated loop radius @xmath9 is of the order of @xmath8  it is the number of loops that is changing . the helical screw dislocation can also generate loops in a manner similar to that proposed in ref.@xcite . [ the detailed study of this effect in the context of the superfluid core will be conducted elsewhere ] .        .",
    "the endpoints of the dislocation are in a contact with the superfluid reservoir.the ( solid ) area under the curve indicates either the injected extra matter leading to the formation of new basal layer ( actually two of them in _ hcp _ ) or a removed part of the existing one . ]",
    "let s consider one segment of a superclimbing dislocation of some initial length @xmath7",
    ". such a segment can be at a crystal boundary or be a part of the superfluid network .",
    "if the bias @xmath0 is applied , the segment will bow due to an extra matter delivered through its ends .",
    "such bowing occurs in the basal plane while the burgers vector @xmath10 is perpendicular to the plane , that is , along the high symmetry axis .",
    "this process is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as an arc protruding between two basal layers .    at this point ,",
    "let s specify what the bias @xmath0 is .",
    "an increase of chemical potential of the superfluid reservoir @xmath11 either by applying pressure @xcite or through the fountain effect @xcite creates a difference @xmath12 between chemical potentials of the solid @xmath13 and the liquid . as a result",
    ", an additional matter can be injected into the solid in a form of growing pairs of basal plane layers .",
    "the boundary of one pair of layers is the superclimbing dislocation . if @xmath14 , an existing pair of layers is being dissolved .",
    "its boundary is also a superclimbing dislocation .",
    "the added or removed part of the planes is shown by a colored solid area under the arc in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is important to realize that imposing any finite value of @xmath0 ( that is deviation from the equilibrium value ) results , strictly speaking , in the instability .",
    "this can be understood from simple energy balance : the energy gain due to the bowing @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being a number of atoms delivered through the core to support the bowing , always exceeds the energy @xmath17 due to the core length increase from @xmath8 to @xmath2 for large enough @xmath2 because @xmath16 is given by the area swept during the bowing .",
    "thus , for large enough @xmath2 the energy gain due to the bowing always dominates the energy loss due to the length increase .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath18 the ( meta)stability is protected by a macroscopic energy barrier .",
    "this barrier vanishes if @xmath19 exceeds a threshold @xmath20 so that the absolute instability develops .",
    "as the estimates provided later show , the actual experiments @xcite appear to be well in this regime .",
    "let s estimate the threshold value @xmath1 for the bias .",
    "the energy of the dislocation per its unit length is given by shear modulus @xmath21 and burgers vector @xmath10 as @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 .",
    "the energy gain @xmath24 scales by the area @xmath25 swept by the bowing dislocation .",
    "thus , equating one to the other gives @xmath1 as _",
    "c ~. [ inst ] the value of @xmath10 in eq.([inst ] ) is the burgers vector along the _ hcp _ axis , that is , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the interatomic distance @xmath28 . as was found in the simulations @xcite , this dislocation splits into two partials with @xmath29 and the fault in between .",
    "thus , effectively , @xmath10 is reduced by a factor of 2 so that the actual threshold ( [ inst ] ) becomes lower by a factor of about @xmath30 . in the following discussions",
    "i will ignore this peculiarity of the structure , which can only modify the numerical coefficient without affecting the dependence @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , in all the following estimates the value of @xmath10 will be taken as @xmath32   and the core splitting will be ignored .",
    "the above relation can be supported by a more quantitative analysis . in the quasi - static situation",
    ", so that @xmath0 is the same over the whole dislocation length , the bowing dislocation takes the shape of circular arc characterized by the base @xmath8 and the angle @xmath33 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . at small @xmath34 the center of the circle is outside the crystal so that the circle radius @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "as the arc grows , @xmath37 eventually reaches @xmath38 and @xmath9 decreases to @xmath39 and then @xmath40 so that the center of the circle enters the crystal and @xmath9 starts growing to become @xmath41 .",
    "the total energy of such a configuration can be represented as e = r_0 - r^2(_0 - _ 0 ) [ arc ] where the radius @xmath9 of the arc is determined by @xmath8 and the angle @xmath37 as @xmath42 .",
    "this expression indicates that the dislocation is absolutely unstable toward inflation @xmath43 for arbitrary small @xmath34 simply because the second term is negative and can dominate at large enough @xmath9 .",
    "there is , however , an energy barrier to overcome before the instability develops unless @xmath34 exceeds some critical value .",
    "let s consider a specific situation when the end points of the dislocation are pinned by a contact with a superfluid reservoir so that @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "then , the energy ( [ arc ] ) becomes a variable of the angle @xmath37 only : e(l_0 , _",
    "0)= e_0 , [ ed ] where @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "as the analysis of the function ( [ ed ] ) indicates , for @xmath46 there is a metastable minimum at @xmath47 followed by a maximum at larger @xmath37 . at @xmath48 both ,",
    "the minimum and the maximum , coincide at @xmath49 which is the inflection point indicating ending of the metastability domain , so that at @xmath50 the dislocation becomes unstable toward unlimited inflation @xmath51 . as can be seen , the threshold @xmath52 , that is , _ c= [ inst2 ] is consistent with the estimate ( [ inst ] ) .    in a general situation",
    "one should expect a distribution of the lengths @xmath8 so that some segments remain in a metastable equilibrium and some are overcritical . in what follows",
    "such a distribution will be ignored and it will be considered that there are @xmath53 segments of some length @xmath8 in a solid affected by the bias @xmath0 .",
    "typical values utilized in the flow experiments @xcite , when the syringe effect was observed , are in the range @xmath54k ( which corresponds to @xmath55j / g in units of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the lengths of the critical segment @xmath56 m ( for a typical @xmath57bar and @xmath58 ) .",
    "the expected density of dislocations in high quality 4 crystals is at the level of @xmath59@xmath60 as found in ref.@xcite , which implies that the actual lengths @xmath8 of free segments are about a factor of 10 - 100 longer than the above estimate . in other words , the experimental range of @xmath0 used in ref .",
    "@xcite appears to be well above the threshold ( [ inst ] ) ( or ( [ inst2 ] ) ) . at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that the dislocation density values @xcite are more relevant to the glide effect than to the superclimb .",
    "nevertheless , this order of magnitude estimate can be used as a figure of merit .",
    "as found in _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite , screw dislocation in solid 4 with burgers along the _ hcp _ axis has a superfluid core .",
    "if this dislocation is straight , there are no edge - type segments on it , and , therefore , it can not perform the superclimb . here it will be shown that , if such a dislocation is biased by chemical potential similarly to the edge segment discussed above , it will become unstable toward forming a helix with its axis parallel to the original orientation of the dislocation .",
    "such a helix has the edge - type rim and , thus , it can be a cause of the syringe effect .",
    "let s consider a screw dislocation of length @xmath2 oriented along the z - axis ( that is , the _ hcp _ axis ) .",
    "then , a position of the core can be described in the cylindrical coordinates by the radial distance @xmath61 from its original position @xmath62 ( in units of @xmath10 ) as well as by the azimuthal angle @xmath63 .",
    "the energy consists of two terms : the work done @xmath64 by the bias @xmath0 to accumulate some amount of matter @xmath65 due to creating the edge - type rim and the energy @xmath66 due to the core length increase : e_s= _",

    "in other words , the total amount @xmath65 is given by the projection of the helix on the basal plane times the number of the complete turns .",
    "the `` sign '' of the matter accumulation depends on @xmath69 : if the screw is right handed , @xmath70 , and the helix is right handed , @xmath71 , the solid mass increases , that is , @xmath72 .",

    "conversely , the amount of the syringe matter becomes negative if the chiralities are opposite to each other .",
    "eventually , it will be seen that the sign of the syringe fraction does not depend on the screw chirality and is solely determined by the sign of the bias @xmath0 as @xmath75 .    as a specific choice of the boundary condition ,",
    "let s presume that this dislocation is pinned at its both ends , that is , @xmath76 .",
    "then , the variation with respect to @xmath77 gives the equation _ z = - , [ hel ] where the boundary condition is taken into account .",

    "let s presume that the extra matter resides in @xmath53 dislocation segments of length @xmath8 which bowed by an amount @xmath89 each .",
    "such bowing results in the extra matter @xmath90 added to ( or subtracted from ) the solid .",

    "solid 4 with finite density of superclimbing dislocations in a contact with superfluid reservoir is found to be , in general , characterized by bistability with respect to the syringe fraction .",
    "this feature is due to the interplay between three contributions : i ) the chemical potential energy gain due to a transfer of atoms between two phases  solid and superfluid ; ii ) the energy of the deformation of dislocations needed to accommodate the transfer ; and iii ) the collective elastic energy .",
    "the control parameter of the system are chemical potential and the density of the dislocations . at low densities of dislocations",
    "the two fractions are very different from each other and , therefore , the transition between them can be viewed as strongly ist order transition with significant hysteresis .",
    "there is a similarity between this and liquid - gas transitions , with the exception of no critical point in the first case .",
    "it is highly likely that the syringe effect observed in refs.@xcite is essentially in the overcritical regime . in this regime the equilibrium syringe fraction",
    "is given by the liquid type isochoric compressibility despite that the linearized response may predict much smaller values .",
    "the are two major scenarios for the instability .",
    "first , the vycor - solid boundary can be a source of the superclimbing dislocation loops entering the bulk .",
    "its dynamics is characterized by the ballistic and dissipative stages which can be ohmic or strongly non - linear in the flow velocity .",
    "each regime is characterized by specific powers of the bias and time at the initial stages of the evolution , eqs.([dnbal],[dn_b],[ohm ] ) .",
    "second , there is also an option for the bulk syringe effect where the accumulated fraction is distributed evenly through out the bulk . in its turn , the bulk scenario can proceed in two ways  through the bardeen - herring generation of the prismatic loops or through the helical instability of screw dislocations .",
    "the accumulated fraction in the case of the bardeen - herring instability is determined by constant rate dependencies ( [ rate_nn ] ) , ( [ rate_ohm ] ) in the non - linear and ohmic regimes , respectively . the non - linear regime ( [ rate_nn ] )",
    "turns out to be showing the same type of the dependence of the syringe rate on the bias as the flow rate through the sample observed in the ref.@xcite . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth mentioning a possibility that the flow through solid may not actually be taking place through a static network of dislocations percolating between both vycor electrodes . instead , the loops generated during the bardeen - herring cycles may eventually be moving between two vycor electrodes .",
    "these loops are mobile due to the superflow along their rim and can serve as `` vehicles '' transporting the mater across a sample .",
    "center of mass speed @xmath259 of such a loop is locked to the speed of the superflow @xmath217 along its rim by a simple geometrical relation @xmath260 stemming from the matter conservation .",
    "experimental studies of the actual bias - time - temperature dependencies of the syringe fraction and rates are needed to see if any of the above scenarios take place .",
    "one of the key questions to answer is about the nature of the @xmath204-dependence observed in the non - linear regime of the flow rate @xcite . similar dependence was also observed in a different setup @xcite .",
    "eqs.([dn_b],[ohmdn],[rate_nn],[rate_ohm ] ) contain the superfluid density @xmath171 in the corresponding powers as overall factors . to",
    "what extent the observed temperature dependence can be attributed to these factors remains to be seen .",
    "one possibility could be that the superfluidity along the cores is strongly affected by structural excitations of dislocation ",
    "kinks @xcite and jogs  so that as @xmath204 increases these excitations suppress the overall superfluid density @xmath171 in the cores and , thus , reduce the total flow rate .",
    "it should also be mentioned that superclimbing dislocation does not fit exactly into the paradigm of luttinger liquid because its excitation spectrum is not linear in the momentum @xcite .",
    "to what extent this feature may modify the results ( [ gamma],[gammat ] ) is an open question too .",
    "the `` smoking gun '' evidence for truly superfluid flow would be the detection of the ballistic jump in the syringe fraction which is a _ decreasing _ function of the bias .",
    "some jumps have been observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , their detailed study is of crucial importance .",
    "the main assumption of this work is that density of superclimbing dislocations is low and a sample size is large enough so that the equilibrium for the generated loops is achieved at typical sizes smaller than sample size .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , as it could be the case for very small samples @xcite , a completely different scenario may take place : the conducting network may be created by dislocations proliferating directly between the electrodes . in this case",
    "the actual dynamics may be controlled by changing number of the conducting pathways , that is , balanced by the pathways creation and exiting from a sample .",
