    "the advent of network science @xcite has provided , an important set of computational and statistical physics tools for describing the problem epidemic spreading by incorporating the realistic interaction patterns of the constituents of social and technological systems @xcite .",
    "classical approaches to epidemiology @xcite rely on the use of the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena , so to unveil the onset and the macroscopic impact of epidemic outbreaks .",
    "recently , these techniques have been pervasively adapted to study a variety of critical phenomena on top of networks @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of the former line of research to epidemiology has been the development of a generalized mean - field framework in which general patterns of interactions can be included . in particular , it was shown @xcite that for scale - free networks [ in which the probability distribution of having a node with @xmath0 neighbors follows a power - law , @xmath1 the epidemic onset was anticipated as compared to substrates with more regular ( or homogeneous ) connectivity patterns . moreover , when @xmath2 ( as most of social and technological networks show @xcite ) and for large enough ( thermodynamic limit ) systems , the epidemic onset vanishes , meaning that even a very small fraction of infected elements with small infective power can spread a disease to a macroscopic part of the population by a sequence of contagions between neighbors of the network , as it happens in human contacts @xcite .",
    "apart from the theoretical value of the above finding , its direct implications public health campaigns and the security of technological networks such as the internet demand a deeper understanding about the influence that diverse contact patterns have on disease dynamics , its co - evolution @xcite and the design of new algorithms for immunization and vaccination policies",
    ". typically , these studies aim at identifying the most efficient way for reducing the impact of an epidemic by the vaccination / immunization of the minimal number of nodes . to this aim ,",
    "different methods to identify the most important nodes to be immunized have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the former works concern the immunization of technological networks since in social contexts vaccination is typically voluntary .",
    "thus , the study of the immunization of a population demands to include the ways vaccination and risky behaviors compete and spread across individuals . to this aim ,",
    "one consider game theory to formulate a social dilemma in terms of the benefits associated to each of the behaviors : vaccination or not . within this framework",
    "individuals act rationally , i.e. , by choosing their strategy after an evaluation of their potential benefits .",
    "this evaluation is done by considering their perception of the risk to contract the disease .",
    "for well - mixed populations recent results show @xcite that voluntary vaccination is not efficient to reach efficient immunization . however , this kind of approach was generalized to networks @xcite unveiling an enhancement of voluntary vaccination .",
    "the former game theoretical approach considers that agents aim at maximizing their own benefits .",
    "however , the decisions of individuals can evolve in time depending on the epidemic incidence observed in the population . in this framework",
    "agents are prone to adopt the strategies that are expected to perform better based on the information available .",
    "this evolutionary avenue has been recently adopted to the vaccination dilemma .",
    "a first evolutionary avenue is presented in @xcite where both disease transmission and vaccinating behavior evolve in time simultaneously .",
    "the evolution for the fraction of vaccinated individuals is driven by the difference of payoffs between vaccinated and non - vaccinated agents ( as in the case of the well - known replicator equation of evolutionary games @xcite ) , being the latter determined by the epidemic incidence at that time .",
    "a second evolutionary approach is proposed in @xcite . in this case ,",
    "inspired on seasonal influenza , the number of vaccinated individuals remains constant during the duration of the influenza season .",
    "after each season , individuals evaluate the payoffs based on the incidence of the disease in the last season and decide whether to vaccinate or not for the next seasons .    here",
    "we take a similar avenue to that of @xcite regarding the dynamical setup and the motivation : the vaccination for seasonal influeza . however , the way in which payoffs are constructed and the way individuals choose their strategy follows the typical setup of evolutionary games @xcite .",
    "this setup , originally presented in @xcite for the vaccination dilemma , considers that individuals are assigned a payoff that is solely based on the personal experience during the last season .",
    "in addition , the strategic choice is based on the imitation of those individuals with better payoffs .",
    "thus , we do not consider that individuals follow a rational derivation of the payoffs associated to vaccination and risky behavior based on the information available .",
    "this allow us to connect the vaccination dilemma with other studies on the evolutionary game dynamics of social dilemmas @xcite .",
    "in the recent years , the study of the evolutionary game dynamics of social dilemmas on structured populations @xcite have shown that cooperation ( here related to vaccination ) is favored when the interactions among individuals take the form of scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "inspired in this result , in this work we explore the spread of vaccination behavior across networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous ( scale - free ) connectivity patterns .",
    "our results show that when vaccine is perfect scale - free networks enhance the vaccination behavior with respect to homogeneous graphs , thus reducing the impact of the disease on the population .",
    "however , when vaccine is imperfect we find a cross - over effect , and homogeneous networks outperform scale - free .",
    "this latter scenario reveals an interesting competition between the rapid spread of both diseases and cooperative behaviors in scale - free graphs .",
    "as introduced above , to incoporate the competition between disease spreading and evolutionary dynamics on top of a network we entangle these two dynamical frameworks by producing an iterative sequence of a two - stage process . in both stages the interaction pattern among individuals is described by a complex network ( the same network for both the dynamical setups ) .",
    "this network is given by an ( @xmath3 ) adjacency matrix @xmath4 so that when two individuals interact @xmath5 , . in this way ,",
    "the number @xmath6 of neighbors ( contacts ) of a given node , say @xmath7 , is given by @xmath8 .        in this work we will consider two of the most paradigmatic network models : erds - rnyi ( er ) graphs @xcite and barabsi - albert ( ba ) networks @xcite .",
    "the former class of graphs are described by a poisson degree distribution @xmath9 , so that most of the nodes have a connectivity close to the mean value @xmath10 . on the other hand , ba networks display a power - law degree distribution of the form , @xmath11 , thus incorporating the scale - free ( sf ) property of real - world networks .",
    "the implementation of our dynamical setup aims at revealing the differences between the heterogeneous degree pattern displayed in sf and the rather homogeneous structure of er graphs . to this aim , for both er and sf networks , the average connectivity of the nodes is set to @xmath12 .",
    "below we introduce the rules governing the two - stage dynamics that it is also sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the first of the stages of our dynamical setup is based on the evolution of a susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered ( seir ) model @xcite .",
    "this model captures the dynamics of influenza - type infections .",
    "susceptible nodes have not been infected and are healthy .",
    "they catch the disease via direct contact with exposed neighbors at a rate @xmath13 .",
    "exposed nodes are supposed to carry the virus although they still do not display symptoms of the disease , thus these individuals are highly infectious during this incubation period .",
    "exposed nodes infected with some rate @xmath14 which typically is the inverse time of the incubation period of the disease . infected nodes , on the other hand , although still carrying the virus are here assumed not to be infectious . in particular",
    ", we consider that during this period they remain isolated from the rest of the population .",
    "finally , infected nodes pass to the recovered state with rate @xmath15 that is the inverse duration time of the convalescence period .    with the above rules we consider that each node @xmath7 interacts simultaneously with its @xmath6 neighbors per unit time .",
    "thus , for a network described by the adjacency matrix @xmath4 the effective probability that a susceptible node @xmath7 gets the disease per unit time is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 when node @xmath18 is exposed and @xmath19 otherwise . here",
    ", in order to mimic the transmission of ordinary influenza we have set @xmath20 , since the time elapsed between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms is two to three days .",
    "in addition we take @xmath21 since the symptoms of uncomplicated influenza illness resolve after a period of @xmath22 to @xmath23 days , so that the average permanence in the infected state is @xmath24 days .",
    "the addition of vaccinated individuals to the formulation of our seir model implies that initially there is subset of susceptible individuals ( representing a fraction @xmath25 of the total population ) that are less prone to catch the disease than non - vaccinated susceptible ones .",
    "in particular , we consider that a vaccinated individual is infected during a single contact with an exposed one at a rate @xmath26 , where @xmath27 $ ] is a parameter that the quality of the vaccine , being perfect when @xmath28 and useless for @xmath29 . in this way",
    ", the probability that a vaccinated individual @xmath7 is infected per unit time reads : @xmath30 once the values of the epidemic parameters @xmath15 and @xmath14 , the quality @xmath31 of the vaccine and the fraction @xmath25 of vaccinated individuals are set , we leave @xmath13 as the relevant control parameter of the seir model . in addition , the relevant order parameter of the dynamics is the fraction @xmath32 of nodes that got infected once the epidemic process dies out , so that the macroscopic behavior is captured the curve @xmath33 .",
    "for a given value of @xmath13 one starts from an initial state in which a small fraction ( here the @xmath34 ) of the population is set as exposed .",
    "then the seir dynamics is iterated until no individuals remain as exposed or infected .",
    "once the seir dynamics dies out we consider that the seasonal influenza period has passed . before the next seir dynamics starts , individuals evaluate whether to vaccinate or not for the next season . at this point",
    "evolutionary dynamics takes place by assigning to each of the individuals a payoff @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) that depends on their experience accumulated during the last seir propagation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there are four possibilities :    * vaccinated individuals that remain healthy during the last season have payoff @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is a cost associated to the vaccine ) . * vaccinated individuals that were infected during the last season have payoff @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the time units that the individual remain in the infected state ) .",
    "* individuals that did not vaccinated and remain healthy during the season have payoff @xmath41 . * non - vaccinated individuals that were infected",
    "are assigned a payoff @xmath42 .",
    "the cost @xmath38 associated to the vaccination is related to different issues such as the time spent to get vaccinated ( via public health services ) or the probability that the vaccine causes effects . to illustrate the vaccination dilemma let us show a very simple situation of a susceptible agent @xmath7 in contact with an exposed agent . in this situation",
    "the expected payoff of @xmath7 when having taken the vaccine is : @xmath43 ( here we assume that @xmath44 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if agent @xmath7 has adopted a risky behavior , its expected payoff turns into : @xmath45 .",
    "thus , in this single pairwise encounter , the rational choice is not to take the vaccine for any costs @xmath46 .",
    "this simple situation clearly reveals the vaccination dilemma .",
    "however , in a networked population the situation is rather more complex and , more importantly , here we assume that individuals are not fully rational and , instead of deciding their behavior on expectations , they evolve their strategies based on their previous experience .",
    "evolutionary dynamics provides the framework to implement the dynamical evolution of strategies .",
    "in particular , as it is usually done in evolutionary social dilemmas on networks , each individual , say @xmath7 , chooses at random one of its first neighbors , say @xmath18 , and compares their payoffs @xmath35 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "then , the probability that agent @xmath7 takes the strategy of @xmath18 , @xmath48 , for the next season increases with their payoff difference , @xmath49 .",
    "one of the most used frameworks to calculate this probability is that of the fermi - like rule @xcite , in which the probability that the strategy of the neighbor @xmath18 is adopted by @xmath7 reads : @xmath50}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a parameter that allows to between random ( @xmath52 ) and strong selection ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "here we adopted @xmath54 and checked that our results are quite robust under changes of @xmath51 .",
    "the update of strategies takes place simultaneously for all the agents .",
    "the new strategies are taken , the payoffs are set to zero and the seir dynamics starts again with a new fraction @xmath25 of vaccinated susceptible individuals .     for er and sf networks when vaccination is not allowed .",
    "the bottom panel shows the evolution of the of recovered individuals , @xmath32 , with the generations of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the network is sf and the rate of infection per contact is @xmath55 , whereas vaccination is perfect @xmath28 and it has a cost @xmath56.,width=316 ]    finally , let us note that we iterate the sequence of the two - stage process ( seir dynamics and evolutionary dynamics ) for a number of steps ( generations ) state for the relevant observables : the average fraction of recovered , @xmath57 , and vaccinated individuals , @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , at the beginning of each generation we randomly assign the individuals that are vaccinated ( so that they constitute the @xmath59 of the population ) and those that are initially set as exposed ( reaching the @xmath34 of the total population ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in real cases a small fraction of the population gain permanent immunity from the exposure to the virus in the last generation . in our case",
    "we do not consider such inherited immunity to the new strain .",
    "we start our discussion by briefly reporting the behavior of the seir model without vaccinated individuals . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the average fraction @xmath57 of recovered individuals at the end of the seir dynamics as a function of the rate of infection per contact , @xmath13 , for er and sf networks of @xmath60 . from this figure",
    "it becomes clear that sf networks accelerates the onset @xmath61 of the epidemic regime as compared to er graphs .",
    "let us now focus on the case sf networks to evaluate the impact that voluntary vaccination ( under an evolutionary framework ) has on the immunization of the system . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the evolution of the fraction of recovered individuals @xmath32 for a sequence of @xmath62 generations .",
    "the rate of infection used in this simulation is set to @xmath55 which , as the top panel shows , corresponds to a situation in which almost all the population has been infected @xmath63 when no vaccination is allowed . instead ,",
    "when individuals can decide whether to take the vaccination ( under the aforementioned evolutionary rules ) we show that the epidemic phase does not appear ( @xmath64 ) since the population has evolutionarily adopted the vaccination strategy .",
    "remarkably , the transient regime ( lasting around @xmath65 generations ) shows an interesting pattern of rise - and - falls for the number of recovered individuals @xmath32 .",
    "this behavior points out that , before vaccination prevails , the population displays an oscillating behavior between vaccination and risky behavior .",
    "obviously , when many people vaccinate ( falls in r ) the epidemic falls but vaccinated individuals are tempted not to take the vaccine due to the higher benefits of risky individuals .",
    "this leads to a progressive increase of the infections ( by the increase of @xmath32 ) that reverse the balance of benefits between risky and vaccinated individuals .",
    "this rise - and - fall behavior together with the significative duration of this transient regime reveal the importance of risk perception in voluntary vaccination .",
    "now we analyze the behavior after the transient regime . to this aim",
    "we compute the average fraction of vaccinated @xmath58 and recovered @xmath57 individual in the steady state as a function of @xmath13 and the quality @xmath31 of the vaccine .",
    "for each couple of values ( @xmath13 , @xmath31 ) we have run @xmath66 simulations ( each of them comprising @xmath62 generations ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we report these functions for several vaccine costs @xmath38 in sf networks .",
    "in particular , the panels in the top show the diagrams @xmath67 and those in the bottom show @xmath68 . from left to right the panels correspond to the following vaccine costs : @xmath56 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "let us focus on those diagrams corresponding to @xmath56 [ panels ( a ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "the function @xmath71 shows that for values of @xmath72 $ ] ( roughly perfect vaccination ) the epidemic threshold disappears since @xmath73 for all the values of @xmath13 . in its turn , we note from panel ( d ) that for this latter region the fraction of vaccinated individuals is roughly @xmath74 except for very low values of @xmath13 for which the disease can not spread even when no immunization is present .",
    "if we increase further the value of @xmath31 we recover the epidemic onset @xmath61 whose values decreases as the vaccine get worse , i.e. , as @xmath31 increases .",
    "in addition , the vaccination behavior decreases so that for a given value of @xmath31 the advantage provided by vaccines is not useful anymore for @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , for @xmath29 we recover the usual diagram @xmath33 , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for sf networks since the vaccine provides no advantage and , as shown in panel ( d ) , almost no individual in the network holds the vaccination strategy @xmath76 for all @xmath13 values .",
    "as we increase the cost of the vaccine to @xmath77 [ panels ( b ) and ( e ) ] and @xmath78 [ panels ( c ) and ( f ) ] we observe that the overall of recovered ( vaccinated ) individuals increases ( decreases ) .",
    "remarkably , the maximum value of @xmath31 for which there is no epidemic threshold decreases with @xmath38 and for @xmath78 we can not appreciate this effect .",
    "it is interesting to note that the usual epidemic diagram of sf networks without immunization is recovered for lower values of @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , in panel ( b ) we note that for @xmath79 the curve @xmath33 does not change whereas from panel ( e ) we note that , within this region , individuals do not vaccinate anymore ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "having reported the macroscopic behavior in sf networks as concerns the influence of the vaccine quality and its cost , we now focus on the dependence on the networked substrate in which both the disease and the vaccination strategies spread . to this aim",
    ", we compare the behavior in sf and er networks in order to measure the role of degree heterogeneity on the vaccination behavior .",
    "importantly , we have considered sf networks as obtained from the barabsi - albert model @xcite after a complete randomization preserving the degree sequence of the nodes . in this way",
    ", we obtain sf networks with @xmath11 without any kind of degree - degree correlations that could influence the dynamical behavior . in addition , we have increased the size of the networks considered ( in order to fully exploit the heterogeneous property of sf networks ) to @xmath81 nodes .",
    "( top panels ) and vaccination @xmath82 ( bottom panels ) diagrams for er and sf networks ( @xmath81 , @xmath12 ) when the vaccine is perfect ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the cost associated to the vaccine are @xmath77 ( left panels ) and @xmath78 ( right panels).,width=331 ]    we first explore the case of perfect vaccination , @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the diagrams @xmath83 ( top ) and @xmath82 ( bottom ) for two different vaccination costs : @xmath77 [ panels ( a ) and ( c ) ] and @xmath78 [ panels ( b ) and ( d ) ] . in these panels",
    "we also show the standard deviations around the average values reported . from the panels we observe that sf networks outperform er graphs since the overall average number of recovered ( vaccinated ) individuals is smaller ( higher ) in sf networks .",
    "in particular , the epidemic diagrams @xmath83 display a clear peak around the respective epidemic thresholds , @xmath61 , of the original ( without vaccination ) graphs . up to this point @xmath84",
    ", the epidemic does not spread and thus vaccination behavior is not observed either as shown in the diagrams @xmath85 .",
    "the peak thus point out that the risk is so small that vaccination behavior do not show up and to a burst of infections which reaches higher values in er graphs .",
    "this result seems counterintuitive , since from the , sf graphs are always more prone to the spread of diseases than er ones .",
    "furthermore , from the diagrams @xmath85 we note that the vaccination onset starts earlier for sf graphs , as their natural epidemic threshold are smaller than that of er .    for values of @xmath13 above the natural epidemic threshold , the number of recovered nodes decreases dramatically in both networks . here",
    ", the risk of infection becomes larger and individuals start to adopt the vaccination strategy as diagrams @xmath85 in panels ( c ) and ( d ) show .",
    "however , vaccination behavior spreads easier in sf networks than in er graphs and it is quite remarkable that , for this regime , the number of recovered nodes in er graphs is always ( for any value of @xmath13 ) higher than in sf networks . thus cooperative behavior , by taking the vaccine , spreads better in sf networks , in agreement with those studies about cooperation and social dilemmas in complex networks @xcite .",
    "( top panels ) and vaccination @xmath82 ( bottom panels ) diagrams for er and sf networks ( @xmath81 , @xmath12 ) when the vaccine is not perfect ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the cost associated to the vaccine are @xmath77 ( left panels ) and @xmath78 ( right panels ) .",
    "the imperfection of the vaccine causes two crossovers , one for @xmath57 and the other one for @xmath58 , between the performance of sf networks and er graphs.,width=331 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we explore the scenario of imperfect vaccination considering @xmath86 .",
    "this regime shows the competition between two well - known effects : the aforementioned prevalence of cooperative behaviors in sf networks ( with respect to er graphs ) and their weakness to the spread of diseases ( again with respect to er graphs ) .",
    "this competition appears as a crossover between the behavior of both @xmath87 and @xmath82 in sf and er networks . in panels ( a ) and",
    "( b ) we show that the curves @xmath87 ( after the peak close to the natural epidemic thresholds of both networks ) cross at some @xmath88 values , .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show also a crossover behavior for @xmath89 , which appears with some delay with respect to that occurring at @xmath88 for @xmath87 .",
    "note that this crossover is well defined since the standard deviations around the average values @xmath57 and @xmath58 are extremely low .    the behavior for @xmath90 shows as for the perfect vaccination case .",
    "sf networks outperform er graphs showing a larger number of vaccinated individuals and a smaller number of infections .",
    "however , . in this way",
    ", panels ( a ) and ( b ) show that the failure of vaccination starts to become evident in sf networks at @xmath88 . the smaller benefits provided by the imperfection of the vaccine cause that the number of vaccinated individuals starts to decrease after @xmath88 .",
    "being larger the number of infections the imperfect vaccine in sf networks , as shown for @xmath91 , the fall of vaccinated individuals occurs in sf networks at smaller values of @xmath13 than in er graphs , giving rise to the crossover for @xmath58 shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that for large @xmath13 values and for @xmath78 [ panels ( b ) and ( d ) ] the number of vaccinated individuals vanishes and the values of @xmath57 in a similar way as in the original network ( without vaccination ) .",
    "obviously , as the vaccine cost @xmath38 increases , the solution @xmath92 spans across a larger interval of @xmath13 values so that for large enough @xmath38 there is no vaccinated individual in the population and one finally recovers the typical @xmath87 diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2].(a ) .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the evolution of voluntary vaccination in networked populations . at variance with classical approaches",
    "we have considered an evolutionary framework so that individuals facing the vaccination dilemma do not take the most rational strategy by considering the benefits associated to each choice . on the contrary ,",
    "they are considered as replicating agents that imitate the strategies based on their previous experience . to this aim",
    "we have entangled the spreading dynamics of an influenza - like disease with an evolutionary framework taking place at the end of each season .",
    "our results show that when vaccine is perfect ( so that vaccinated individuals do not get infected ) scale - free networks enhance both the vaccination behavior and the effective immunization of the population as compared with random graphs with homogeneous connectivity patterns .    by considering vaccine imperfection",
    "we obtain two remarkable results .",
    "first , we have shown that , for scale - free networks and low vaccine costs , there is a threshold value for the vaccine imperfection so that , for values lower than this threshold , vaccination behavior spans across the population and it is possible to suppress the disease for all the infection probabilities .",
    ", when vaccine imperfection becomes large , agents are less prone to take it and the disease takes advantage of this risky behavior to spread efficiently across the population .",
    "the other interesting result concerns the comparison between scale - free and homogeneous networks . we have shown that when imperfection appears the better performance of scale - free network is broken and there is a cross - over effect so that the number of infected ( vaccinated ) individuals increases ( decreases ) with respect to homogeneous networks when @xmath13 is large enough .",
    "this cross - over results from the competition of two well - known dynamical properties of scale - free networks : the fast propagation of diseases and the promotion of cooperative behaviors .",
    "thus , the ability of scale - free networks in promoting cooperative behaviors ( here represented as paying the cost of taking vaccine ) is threatened when payoffs are dependent on a related dynamical process ( here the spreading of a disease ) whose evolution is also affected ( here enhanced ) by the heterogeneity of the network",
