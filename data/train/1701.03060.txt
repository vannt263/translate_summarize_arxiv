    "why area inside a circle again ? why we should nt confound the notions of intuition and rigor ?",
    "do calculus books , even today , still resort to circular reasoning ?",
    "this paper is an attempt to elucidate these questions by walking the reader through the path of intuitive to solid analytical reasoning , pointing out the gaps that often occur , on the proof of this ancient and well known problem , first illustrated by archimedes .",
    "the motivation behind writing of this piece was to engage the reader in further thinking about mathematical proofs and the level of rigor at which they are presented .    in the following we present a brief review of the proofs of area inside a circle .",
    "a typical rigorous proof requires knowledge of integral calculus , see for example @xcite .",
    "but even in these proofs presented by calculus books , see for example @xcite , the authors resort to circular reasoning . to prove the area inside a circle , they set up the integral @xmath0 followed by trigonometric substitution which requires knowing that the derivative of @xmath1 is @xmath2 but this latter fact requires proving that @xmath3 for this proof , they resort to a geometric argument , bounding the area of a sector of a unit circle between the areas of two triangles and showing that @xmath4 .",
    "they then apply the squeeze theorem .",
    "but for computation of the sector s area , they resort to a standard formula , @xmath5 which is based on knowing the area of a circle .",
    "so , they prove the area by assuming the area .",
    "this is obviously circular argumentation ! for an excellent critique of this method see @xcite .",
    "there are also a number of intuitive proofs intended to provide an insight to the derivation of the area with just the knowledge of geometry and limits . in this short piece",
    "we begin by proving a preliminary result showing that @xmath6 without , a priori , assuming the area of a sector .",
    "this limit is central to the proof of the derivatives of trigonometric functions .",
    "we note that aside from the aforementioned limit , the function @xmath7 itself plays an important role not only in mathematics but in other fields of science such as physics and engineering .",
    "consider a circle of radius 1 , centered at the origin , as shown in fig . 1 ; see @xcite .",
    "]    let @xmath8 be an angle measured in radians . then , @xmath9    since the magnitude of @xmath10 equals the length of the arc it subtends and since @xmath11 we have that @xmath12 or @xmath13 this establishes a lower bound for @xmath14 to show the upper bound , observe that by the triangle inequality , @xmath15 this can be established by the standard method of estimating an arc length of a rectifiable curve by the linear approximation of the lengths of the chords it subtends through partitioning .",
    "the result follows by applying the triangle inequality in each partition ; see @xcite .",
    "noting that @xmath16 we get @xmath17 but @xmath18",
    "so , @xmath19 and @xmath20 combining this result with the previous lower bound gives , @xmath21 letting @xmath22 in the last expression completes the upper bound , resulting in @xmath23  finally , applying the squeeze theorem we get ,    @xmath24    an interesting question related to the foregoing bounding of the angle @xmath10 is that if we define the derivatives of trigonometric functions of @xmath10 analytically ( i.e. , by infinite series or complex numbers or solutions of differential equations ) , can we arrive at the bounding of the angle ? the next theorem follows .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 then    @xmath27    let @xmath28 than @xmath29 and @xmath30 giving @xmath31 for @xmath32    hence ,    @xmath33    therefore , @xmath34 this gives a lower bound for @xmath10 .",
    "to find an upper bound for @xmath35 let @xmath36    @xmath37 and @xmath38 giving @xmath39 for @xmath32    hence ,    @xmath40    therefore , @xmath41 this gives an upper bound for @xmath10 .",
    "combining the above results we get @xmath42    area inside a circle of radius @xmath43 is @xmath44    consider a circle of radius @xmath43 centered at the origin in fig .",
    "2 .    ]",
    "partition the circle into @xmath45 equal slices and consider a slice with central angle @xmath46 radians .",
    "we know that the area of a triangle is one - half times the product of two of its sides times the sine of the angle between the two sides .",
    "so , the area of the triangle subtended by the central angle @xmath46 becomes @xmath47 because there are @xmath45 inscribed triangles in the circle , the total area of all these triangles would be @xmath48 as we increase the number of slices by increasing @xmath49 the sum of the areas of the inscribed triangles get closer to the area of the circle . to get the area of the circle , we need to find the limit of @xmath50 , as @xmath51 so , using ( [ limit ] ) , and since @xmath52 as @xmath53 the area of the circle becomes :    @xmath54 @xmath55    hence , @xmath56    an intuitive and interesting method of proving the area inside a circle which requires area stretching and horizontally by a factor of @xmath57 then its area will stretch by the factor @xmath58 and mapping from an annulus to a trapezoid is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the subtle point in this method , as expressed in @xcite , is that it assumes as evident the area preservation from a circular to a simply connected region . for a discussion of transformation of different regions using complex variable method , see @xcite .",
    "there are many other intuitive approaches also , some of which involve slicing or opening up a circle .",
    "below we offer a simple intuitive proof which is not based on area stretching , but assumes area preservation under mappings .",
    "consider two concentric circles with radii @xmath59 and @xmath43 and corresponding areas @xmath60and @xmath61 .",
    "cut the annulus open in the shape of a right angle trapezoid @xmath62 as in fig .",
    "3 .    ]",
    "we can see that the area of the annulus equals the area of the trapezoid .",
    "so , @xmath63 , or @xmath64 we can choose @xmath65 as small as we please and so , in particular , if we let @xmath59 approach @xmath66 the area of the inner circle approaches @xmath67 and we get , @xmath68 thus @xmath69 note that shrinking @xmath59 to @xmath66 shrinks the trapezoid to the right triangle @xmath70 whose area is @xmath71 in the following we present an analytic proof of the area inside a circle using area stretching , which does not assume area preserving mapping of regions .",
    "area inside a circle of radius @xmath59 is @xmath72    consider a circle of radius @xmath59 centered at the origin and partition it into @xmath45 equal sectors , each having central angle @xmath73 and the corresponding arc length @xmath74 assume the area of a sector is @xmath75 if @xmath76we stretch the radius @xmath59 by a factor of @xmath77 we create a circle with radius @xmath78 so , the corresponding streched sector will have an arc length equal to @xmath79 and the its area will be increased by a factor of @xmath80 to @xmath81 see fig . 4  now the area between the two sectors is @xmath82 $ ] which is approximately equal to the area of the trapezoid @xmath83 in fig .",
    "4 .    ]",
    "if we connect the center @xmath84 to the point @xmath85 which is the midpoint of @xmath86 the triangles @xmath87 and @xmath88 become right angle congruent triangles with right angles at the point @xmath89 as a result , central angles @xmath90 and @xmath91 will each equal @xmath92 obviously triangles @xmath93 and @xmath94 are also congruent having right angles at the point @xmath95 to calculate the area of the trapezoid , we note that its larger base has length @xmath96 and its smaller base has length @xmath97 the height of the trapezoid is : @xmath98 therefore the area of the trapezoid becomes : @xmath99\\cdot\\left [ r\\cos\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}-r\\cos\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}\\right]\\\\ & = & \\sin\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}\\cos\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}[r^{2}-r^{2}]\\notag\\\\ & = & \\sin\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}\\cos\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}\\cdot r^{2}[k^{2}-1].\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting @xmath100 , gives , @xmath101\\approx\\sin\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}\\cos\\dfrac{\\pi}{n}\\cdot r^{2}[k^{2}-1],\\ ] ] or @xmath102 this approximation can be improved by increasing @xmath103 now , multiplying both sides of the above by @xmath45 gives : @xmath104 since there are exactly @xmath45 identical sectors in the circle of radius @xmath105 its area becomes @xmath106 therefore , @xmath107 @xmath108 now , taking the limit of both sides as @xmath53 and applying our earlier result ( [ limit ] ) and the fact that @xmath109 as @xmath22,we get :    @xmath110    hence , @xmath111",
