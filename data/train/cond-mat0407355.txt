    "for a magnet to be soft , weak fields must be able to change the overall magnetisation readily .",
    "such high permeability comes about because the energies of the domain walls are low so that the magnetic anisotropy constants , @xmath2 , are also very small .",
    "the internal stresses caused by the changes of magnetisation must also be minimal making the magnetostriction coefficients , @xmath3 , as small as possible.@xcite roughly the magnetic permeability is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the saturation magnetisation and @xmath7 is a measure of magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction , @xmath8 .",
    "some of the magnetically softest ferromagnetic materials are based on the ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 permalloy and their high permeability finds them numerous applications in , for example , magnetic recording heads , spin valve devices and electrical power generation . in binary ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 alloys ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 both vary with concentration @xmath11 and in the vicinity of @xmath12 pass through zero at slightly different compositions and so the addition of a third or fourth component is required to achieve the focus of zero.  @xcite general guidelines for achieving near zero anisotropy and magnetostriction in ternary and quaternary ni@xmath0fe@xmath1-based permalloys are now well established thanks to experimental work on hundreds of samples .",
    "@xcite    recently we have carried out a theoretical investigation for a prototypical soft magnetic metal , body - centered cubic ( bcc ) iron  @xcite , and have examined how its @xmath2 and @xmath3 would vary if its lattice spacing ( volume ) and number of valence electrons ( band - filling ) could be altered .",
    "we have found that on reducing the band - filling and increasing the volume , iron s magnetic properties soften considerably .",
    "this situation can be realised in practice by doping bcc fe with vanadium .",
    "we then tested our model by an explicit study of iron - rich fe - v alloys and found the optimal composition for the smallest @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we found that fe@xmath13v@xmath14 is a high permeability material .",
    "good agreement with experimental values for the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) and magnetostriction of both fe and v was found .    in this paper , we start instead from a binary component ` parent ' soft magnet , ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 with @xmath15 and see if a similar , ab - initio approach can explain how the addition of small amounts of non - magnetic impurities , cu and mo , produce the magnetically softest permalloys .",
    "our approach is based on the spin - polarized relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker ( spr - kkr ) density functional theoretical ( dft ) method , within the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite for randomly disordered alloys .",
    "we explore the variation of the two main factors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in ni@xmath9fe@xmath16cu(mo)@xmath17 with concentrations @xmath11 and @xmath18 and find the values which bring both quantities to optimally low values to promote high permeability .",
    "james _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have also recently carried out studies of the magnetostriction and magnetic anisotropy of 3d transition metal alloys from a ` first principles ' electronic structure framework . from their calculations , they propose that the trends are linked to the number of occupied minority spin d - states .",
    "we see if such a link is evident from our calculations here on binary and ternary permalloys .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy constants @xmath2 of ni - rich permalloys depend also on the existence of the long- and short - range order .",
    "there is a @xmath19(cu@xmath20au)-ordered ni@xmath20fe phase below 600@xmath21c .",
    "the high permeability values of technically important 80  % ni permalloys are achieved by specified annealing in the ordered range ni@xmath20fe . here , the manufacturing processes and final heat treatment of permalloys are very important role for the alloys microstructures and also their final magnetic properties ( coercivity , hysteresis loop shape etc . ) .",
    "consequently , we also present here a study of the effect of compositional order on the high permeability ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 alloy and how this may be expected to vary when a non - magnetic transition metal dopant is added .",
    "this builds on our earlier work in which we described why directional chemical order and significant uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is induced in permalloy when it is annealed in a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    in the next section we briefly summarise our approach for calculating the mae of metals and alloys , using the spr - kkr method .",
    "we then show how the magnetostriction can also be found . in the following section we use the spr - kkr method to study ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 , ( @xmath15 ) and related ni - fe - cu and ni - fe - mo ternary alloys focussing on the region where high permeability appears .",
    "we discuss these results in terms of band - filling ( number of valence electrons per atom ) and the number of minority spin electrons plus features from the electronic densities of states .",
    "we interpret a key feature of our results by a further investigation of ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 in which the effect of doping with a non - magnetic impurity is modelled simply .",
    "the next section outlines the theoretical framework for compositional order in alloys and the theory for mae in context of its dependence upon atomic short - range compositional order .",
    "the penultimate section presents our calculation of the dependence of mae with compositional order in ni@xmath22fe@xmath23 and also analyses how much this varies with hypothetical band - filling .",
    "we deduce that the sensitivity of the high permeabilities of the ni@xmath22fe@xmath24cu@xmath25 to annealing conditions is itself dependent on the precise composition .",
    "the final section summarises and concludes .",
    "magnetic anisotropy of a material derives largely from spin - orbit coupling of the electronic structure .",
    "both the origin of this effect , as well as the magnetostatic effects which determine domain structure , can be found from the relativistic generalisation of spin density functional theory .",
    "@xcite from the formal starting point of the quantum electrodynamics of electrons interacting with an electromagnetic field , a system s ground state energy is the minimum of a functional of the charge and current densities .",
    "this minimisation is achieved , in principle , by the self - consistent solution of a set of kohn - sham dirac equations for independent electrons moving in fields set by the charge and current densities .",
    "once approximations for exchange - correlation and the gordon decomposition of the current into orbital and spin pieces are made , the spin - orbit coupling effects upon the electronic structure can be represented and the magnetic anisotropy described .",
    "( the magnetostatic shape anisotropy is also described from within the same theoretical framework @xcite but not considered for the cubic materials of this paper . )    most theoretical investigations of mae and calculations of the anisotropy constants @xmath2 place their emphasis on spin - orbit coupling effects using either perturbation theory or a fully relativistic theory , e.g. @xcite . typically the total energy , or the single - electron contribution to it ( if the force theorem is used @xcite ) , is calculated for two magnetisation directions , @xmath26 and @xmath27",

    "hence , for this narrow composition range of ni - fe - cu , the magnetostriction coefficients , @xmath107 while the mae value remains low enough for this alloy to develop high permeability .    from the mae calculations of pure fe and ni we know that the lattice constant is also an important factor .",
    "here we have used the experimental lattice constants and therefore , the magnetovolume effect has not been examined .",
    "our spr - kkr - cpa calculations have been used to study the effect of the variation of doping with an early and late transition metal on the magnetic anisotropy properties of permalloys and give an explanation of the experimentally observed and well - known facts on the preparation of the high permeability materials . in particular",
    "we have demonstrated why extremely soft magnetic properties of ni - fe - cu(mo ) are developed for rather narrow concentration ranges of the cu / mo dopants , depending on the fe content in ni - rich compositions . up to now",
    "we have assumed that the alloys are completely compositionally disordered .",
    "preparation procedures for high permeability permalloys , however , do instill varying degrees of long- or short - range compositional order which alter the magnetic properties significantly .",
    "we study this aspect in the next sections .",
    "ordering in alloys can be conveniently and succinctly classified in terms of static concentration waves.@xcite for example , at high temperatures , a binary alloy @xmath108 where the atoms are arranged on a regular array of lattice sites , has each of its sites occupied by either an @xmath109- or @xmath110-type atom with probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath111 respectively . in general , in terms of a set of site - occupation variables @xmath112 , ( with @xmath113 when the @xmath114-th site in the lattice is occupied by an @xmath115-type atom ) the thermodynamic average , @xmath116 , of the site - occupation variable is the concentration @xmath117 at that site and for the solid solution @xmath118 for all sites . below some transition temperature , @xmath119 , the system orders or phase separates so that a compositionally modulated alloy forms .",

    "<S> we study ni@xmath0fe@xmath1-based permalloys with the relativistic spin - polarized korringa - kohn - rostoker electronic structure method . treating the compositional disorder with the coherent potential approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate how the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , @xmath2 , and magnetostriction , @xmath3 , of ni - rich ni - fe alloys vary with the addition of small amounts of non - magnetic transition metals , cu and mo . from our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we follow the trends in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and find the compositions of ni - fe - cu and ni - fe - mo where both are near zero . </S>",
    "<S> these high permeability compositions of ni - fe - cu and ni - fe - mo match well with those discovered experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we monitor the connection of the magnetic anisotropy with the number of minority spin electrons @xmath4 . by raising @xmath4 via artificially increasing the band - filling of ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to reproduce the key features that underpin the magnetic softening we find in the ternary alloys . the effect of band - filling on the dependence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on atomic short - range order in ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 is also studied . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations , based on a static concentration wave theory , indicate that the susceptibility of the high permeability of the ni - fe - cu and ni - fe - mo alloys to their annealing conditions is also strongly dependent on the alloys compositions . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal soft magnet appears from these calculations .    </S>",
