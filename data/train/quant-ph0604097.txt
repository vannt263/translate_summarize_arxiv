    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) and quantum critical phenomena , which are induced by the change of parameters and are accompanied by a dramatic change of physical properties , occur at zero temperature in many - body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "usually , a qpt may emerge in the parameter region where there is the energy level crossing or the symmetry - breaking .",
    "qpts have been mainly studied in connection with correlated electron and spin systems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has also been paid much attention in the light - atoms interacting systems @xcite , which enables us to understand the transition from radiation to super - radiation from a different viewpoint .",
    "the systems of atomic ensembles interacting with optical fields have been studied both experimentally and theoretically , e.g. , the electromagnetic induced transparency @xcite and the quantum storage of photon states @xcite .",
    "the thermal phase transition phenomena rzazewski have been studied in the dicke model @xcite ( that is , a two - level atomic ensemble coupling with optical field ) or generalized dicke models @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the qpt in a radiation - matter interacting system was recently explored based on the dicke model , but merely with the single - mode dicke model @xcite . when the coupling parameter @xmath0 varies from that less than the critical value @xmath1 to that larger than @xmath2 , the system goes from the normal phase to the super - radiant one in the presence of the symmetry - breaking . as the precursors of the qpt , the onset of chaos emary and the entanglement properties @xcite were studied in detail .",
    "however , it is noticed that these studies focused only on atomic ensembles with small dimensions compared with the optical wavelength , in which the dipole approximation can be used reslen05,emary , emary2 . in this special case ,",
    "the light - atoms interaction is irrelevant to the spatial positions of atoms .",
    "but , generally speaking , a realistic atomic ensemble may extend in a large scale so that light - atoms interaction is spatially dependent @xcite .    in this paper , an exotic qpt phenomenon",
    "is investigated theoretically by developing the dicke model for a more general case beyond the dipole approximation .",
    "we find that a kind of quantum critical phenomenon also occurs in this extended atomic ensemble , in which each atom interacts with a single mode quantized light field ; but the quantum criticality is quite different from that deduced from the spatially independent dicke model emary . in the present study , a normal phase and four possible super - radiant phases are found , with only one of the four exhibiting the same critical point as that in the normal phase .",
    "remarkably , it is shown that the ground - state energy in the above - mentioned superradiant phase , connects continuously to the normal phase one at the critical point , but its second drivative does not .",
    "let us consider an extended ensemble with @xmath3 identical two - level atoms interacting with a single - mode quantized light field . here",
    ", the spatial dimension of the atomic ensemble is much larger than the optical wavelength of the field .",
    "this radiation - matter system is usually described by a generalized dicke model @xcite with the hamiltonian @xmath4 , @xmath5here , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the wave vector of the quantized light field and @xmath8 is the position of @xmath9th atom ; @xmath10 is the population operator of the @xmath9 atom ; @xmath11 is the flip operators between the excited state @xmath12 and ground state @xmath13 of the @xmath9 atom with the same energy differences @xmath14 for all the atoms ; @xmath15 ( @xmath16 )  is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the quantized light field , with @xmath17 the relative coupling parameter . for simplicity",
    ", the ensemble is assumed to be one - dimensional with its direction along the wave vector .",
    "different from a standard dicke model for small - dimension atomic ensembles @xcite , the spatial - dependent factors @xmath18 are taken into account seriously though the momentum of the center of mass can be neglected .",
    "it is also remarked that the terms connected to the nonrotating - wave scenario are still kept in hamiltonian ( [ 001 ] ) ; in fact , if the rotating - wave approximation were used , the factors @xmath19 would be absorbed into @xmath11 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we can first introduce the following collective operators sun - li - liu - prl : @xmath21it is obvious that in the limit of large @xmath3 with a small number of excitations ( referred to as the normal phase ) , namely , the excitation numbers in states @xmath12  are much less than @xmath3 , the above two operators approximately satisfy the independent bosonic commutation relations@xmath22 \\approx \\left [ c , c^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\approx 1,% \\text { \\ } \\left [ b , c^{\\dagger } \\right ] \\approx 0\\]]in the present extended ensemble , and can approximately be re - expressed as the two independent bose operators @xmath23 and @xmath24@xmath25 = \\left [ c , c^{\\dagger } \\right ] = 1,\\text { \\ } % \\left [ b , c^{\\dagger } \\right ] = 0.\\]]in the present normal phase case , the original radiation - matter system described by eq .",
    "( [ 001 ] ) is approximated as a coupling three - mode bosonic system with the low energyeffective hamiltonian @xmath26    we now apply a bogoliubov transformation to diagonalize the above quadratic hamiltonian ( [ normal ] ) @xcite .",

    "since the matrix @xmath44 is of @xmath45 , general analytic results for the diagonalization of @xmath46 are difficult to obtain .",
    "nevertheless , we can diagonalize it numerically to obtain the eigen - frequencies @xmath47 reduce .",
    "the related canonical transformation matrix @xmath33 can also be obtained numerically .",

    "@xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 here .",
    "certainly , the non - resonance cases can also be studied numerically , with similar features being revealed . as seen from fig .",
    "[ a1 ] , when @xmath51 , the imaginary parts of two eigen - frequencies are non - zero .",
    "this means that the corresponding eigen - frequencies are complex and thus the eigen state is unstable and physically impossible .",
    "but it is inappropriate to consider naively that @xmath52 as the critical point .",
    "since the eigenvalue @xmath53 is negative in the range of @xmath54 , a negative eigen - frequency of the boson - mode is not allowed physically either .",
    "therefore , in the resonance case @xmath48 ( @xmath55 ) , a real critical point is located at @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , for a general case , the critical point is found to be @xmath57 .",
    "in order to describe excitations in the parameter region above the critical point , we now incorporate the fact that both the field and the atomic collective excitations acquire macroscopic occupations , namely , the above approximation to neglect the number of excitations over @xmath3 is no longer valid @xcite . to this aspect , the introduced collective operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 in eq .",

    "meanwhile , for the ground state , @xmath122 below @xmath2 , while@xmath123above @xmath2 , i.e. , the field is macroscopically occupied .",
    "so @xmath124 may be understood as a kind of order parameter of the super - radiant phase , whose critical exponent is @xmath125 above @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "3(b ) presents the ground - state energy densities as a function of coupling for all the possible phases .",
    "clearly , the ground state energy densities of the first super - radiant phase is always the lowest one above @xmath2 , while the other three approach to it in the large @xmath17 limit ; moreover , it connects continuously with that of the normal phase but possesses a discontinuity in its second derivative at @xmath126 through a detailed numerical analysis . from this viewpoint , together with the fact that the same critical point is determined from both sides of the normal phase and the first one , it is most likely that only the first super - radiant phase is a real physical one .",
    "before concluding this paper , we wish to remark briefly on the origin of the occurred qpt in the present work . from fig .",
    "3(a ) , it is clear that the energy level of the first excited state of the system @xmath127 touches the ground state energy level @xmath128 ( or @xmath129 ) at the critical point . obviously , it is this level touching that accounts for the emergence of the qpt and the corresponding quantum criticality in the present generalized dicke model .",
    "it is also remarked that the @xmath130 terms ( where @xmath131 is the vector potential ) has been neglected here , as done in several previous works @xcite , while the absence of @xmath130 terms @xcite seems to be crucial for the observed quantum phase transition in the present model , namely , the presence of @xmath130 terms in the model hamiltonian leads to vanishing of the criticality .",
    "although the effect of non - rwa terms may normally be negligibly small , the present work ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) illustrates that it plays a meaningful role when the atomic number @xmath3 is large , e.g. , the criticality differs from that with the rwa . on the other hand , for actual atoms that may not be pure two - level ones",
    ", other atomic transitions may occur and spoil the present model before the non - rwa terms become important . nevertheless , the present study is still theoretically interesting and valuable , particularly relevant to some atomic systems ( or artificial and atomic - like ones ) wherein the energy spacing of any other transitions is much larger than that of the considered two levels ( or other transitions do not exist ) .",
    "for example , for a dicke - like model consisting of many 1/2 spins coupled to single mode bosonic field ( by electrical dipole coupling - like type ) , other transitions do not exist in the spin systems .",
    "then the counter rotating terms play an important role the when the coupling parameter is close to the critical value .    in conclusion , based on a generalized dicke model",
    ", we have investigated theoretically the quantum criticality of an extended atomic ensemble with a larger spacial dimension comparable to the optical wavelength of a quantized light field .",
    "a useful formalism is developed to study numerically eigenfrequencies of the system in different quantum phases . comparing with the critical phenomenon around the critical point @xmath132 for atomic ensemble of small dimension  emary",
    ", a rather different quantum criticality is revealed around the transition point ( @xmath133 ) from the normal phase to the super - radiant phase .",
