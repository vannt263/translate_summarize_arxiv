    "electromagnetic waves from an astronomical radio source suffer distortion from irregularities in the refractivity of the atmosphere @xcite . at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths ,",
    "the distortions are caused primarily by a turbulent water vapor distribution , though dry air turbulence may also be important under some circumstances @xcite .",
    "the spatial scales of the turbulence extend to kilometer distances with a power law spectrum @xcite that creates atmospheric delay fluctuations on timescales that range from fractions of a second to tens of minutes .",
    "the signal degradation is particularly serious for millimeter - wave radio interferometers in extended configurations , where perturbation of phases across the instrument often exceeds many radians .",
    "these perturbations can lead to decorrelation ( loss of amplitude ) , distortion of the image , and loss of resolution @xcite .",
    "different approaches have been employed to overcome the effect of atmospheric delay fluctuations .",
    "a straightforward approach is _ self - calibration _",
    "@xcite , where the visibility phase used to calibrate the data is measured from the actual science target . a model for the source spatial structure is needed and bright sources are required to measure the fringe phase with a high signal to noise ratio in a short integration .",

    "both methods probe the atmosphere close to the line - of - sight toward the science target , but have limitations in actual applications .",
    "fast position switching reduces the time spent on source by a factor of @xmath2 , while water vapor radiometry requires a physical model to relate the water line brightness and the path correction , as well as it assumes that refractivity fluctuations are produced only by water vapor .    as an alternative approach , an array of closely _ paired antennas _",
    "@xcite continuously monitors the atmospheric phase fluctuations by observing a nearby calibrator .",
    "two arrays of antennas are necessary : antennas belonging to the  science array \" observe the science target and phase calibrator , while antennas belonging to the  reference array \" simultaneously monitor an atmospheric calibrator .",
    "phase correction on the science target and phase calibrator is accomplished by subtracting the visibility phase measured from the atmospheric calibrator on each baseline .",
    "an advantage of the paired antenna technique over water vapor radiometry is that it accounts for atmospheric phase fluctuations due to both water vapor and a dry air component .    between november 2008 and february 2009",
    ", the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) implemented the carma paired antenna calibration system ( c - pacs ) to correct for atmospheric delay fluctuations on the longest baselines of the interferometer ( up to 2  km in length ) .",
    "the goal of c - pacs is to enable routine imaging in the most extended carma configurations .    in this paper",
    "we describe c - pacs and apply this calibration technique to observations of the circumstellar dust around pp  13s*. pp  13s * is a young pre - main sequence star located in the constellation of perseus and embedded in the l1473 dark cloud at a distance of @xmath3 350 pc @xcite .",
    "this object is thought to have experienced a fu - orionis - type outburst in the past due to a massive accretion episode and is now declining in brightness to a quiescent state @xcite .",
    "the fu - orionis nature of pp  13s * has been established based on the highly broadened infrared co absorption bands @xcite , the jet - like feature seen in [ sii ] emission which is characteristic of herbig - haro outflows @xcite , and the consistent dimming and morphology changes observed at near - ir and optical wavelengths over several decades @xcite .",
    "all of these characteristics are common to fu - orionis objects @xcite .",
    "the star , with a bolometric luminosity of 30  l@xmath1  @xcite , is surrounded by an extended disk and envelope that contains about 0.6  m@xmath1  of gas and dust @xcite .",
    "the new carma observations will help understand the origin of the fu - orionis phenomena in pp  13s * by measuring the distribution of dust continuum emission on spatial scales of @xmath4 au .",
    "before presenting the new observations of pp  13s * , we describe the paired antenna calibration system as implemented at carma .",
    "we first describe the antenna configuration used for the observations , and outline the basic principles of the technique .",
    "carma is an heterogeneous interferometer comprising 23 antennas : six 10.4-m telescopes from the california institute of technology / owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) , nine 6.1  m telescopes from the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) , and eight 3.5-m telescopes from the university of chicago sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) .",
    "the two most extended array configurations contain baselines that range in length from 100  m to 1000  m ( b configuration ) and 250  m to 1900  m ( a configuration ) to achieve an angular resolution of 0.3 and 0.15 respectively , at an observing frequency of 230  ghz .",
    "a schematic of c - pacs is shown in figure [ c - pacs ] .",
    "c - pacs pairs the eight 3.5-m antennas with selected 6-m and 10-m antennas , preferentially on the longer baselines .",
    "typically , a 3.5-m antenna is offset by 2030  m to the west of a larger antenna .",
    "this separation is a compromise between the need to put the antennas as close as possible to probe the same atmospheric path and to avoid shadowing between antennas .    the science array , composed of the 6-m and 10-m antennas , operates in the 1.3- or 3-mm atmospheric windows as requested by the investigator .",
    "the reference array , comprising the 3.5-m antennas , operates in the 1-cm window .",
    "the observing cycle consists of observations of the science target interleaved with periodic observations of the phase calibrator .",
    "both the science and reference arrays observe the phase calibrator to measure instrumental phases drifts .",
    "subsequently , the science array observes the science target while the reference array monitors a strong point source ( i.e. , the `` atmospheric '' calibrator ) close to the science target , to measure the delay introduced by the atmosphere .",
    "the atmospheric delay measured by the 3.5-m antennas can then be applied to the science observations .",
    "it is helpful to have a physical picture to understand the principles of the correction .",
    "we suppose the atmosphere to be a pattern of random refractive index variations that is blown across the array at the wind velocity .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the layer is at a height of a couple of kilometers and that the thickness is much less than the height .",
    "general experience at this and other sites show that these conditions are often consistent with what is observed .",
    "other conditions can be present , but can often be characterized by two or more layers at different altitudes with separate wind vectors so that only a small change to the analysis is required .",
    "kolmogorov theory predicts a turbulence distribution with a power law spectrum from less than a millimeter in size to many kilometers .",
    "this results in random delay differences between signals arriving at different antennas that increase with separation as a power law function @xcite .",
    "as the pattern moves over the array , the delay differences are observed as temporal fluctuations in the visibility phases .",
    "the rms of the delay depends on the wind speed , but not its direction .",
    "structures smaller in size than the antenna diameter are averaged out and do not contribute to the phase errors .",
    "structures on scales large in comparison with the baseline length are common to the two antennas on the baseline and therefore tend to cancel out .",
    "from these theoretical considerations supported by experimental evidence @xcite , it is found that the resulting delay variance vs baseline length ( i.e. , the delay structure function ) also follows a power - law .",
    "the theoretical slope of the power - law is 5/3 and 2/3 for two- and three - dimensional kolmogorov turbulence , respectively .      following the discussion in @xcite ,",
    "consider two pairs of antennas as shown in figure [ c - pacs ] .",
    "in the simplest case , we measure the delay difference between the antennas on the reference baseline ( i.e. , baseline @xmath5 in figure  [ c - pacs ] ) as a function of time . assuming a non - dispersive atmosphere , the delay on the science baseline ( i.e. , baseline @xmath6 ) is corrected by applying the delay difference on the reference baseline to the visibility measurement .",
    "the reference and science delays are not identical since the two baselines are not exactly co - located .",
    "the relevant distances that determine the efficacy of the delay corrections are not the baseline lengths at the ground , but the distances between the radio beams as they traverse the turbulent layer ( i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 in figure [ c - pacs ] ) .",
    "the beam separation at the turbulent layer depends upon the relative positions of the target and reference source in the sky , the height of the turbulent layer , and the configuration of the antennas on the ground .",
    "the upper limit to the beam separation is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angular separation between the science target and the atmospheric calibrator , @xmath11 the height of the turbulence , and @xmath12 is the source elevation . assuming that the turbulent layer is at a height of 1  km ( continuous line ) or at 2  km ( dashed line )",
    ", figure  [ fig : ant ] shows the trajectories of the 3.5-m beam locations relative to the 6-m and 10-m beams for an 8  h observation of pp  13s * centered on transit with 3c111 as the atmospheric calibrator . as shown in this figure , the choice of 3c111 as the atmospheric calibrator is particularly fortuitous for pp  13s * since the science and reference beams for most antennas nearly cross within the turbulent zone .    using phase closure @xcite ,",
    "the difference ( @xmath13 ) between the actual delay for the target beams @xmath14 and the atmospheric reference beams @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 . in a favorable configuration ,",
    "the beam separations @xmath17 and @xmath18 will be much less than either the target beam separation @xmath14 or the reference beam separation @xmath15 .",
    "the rms of the corrected visibilities will be @xmath19 worse than for an array with beam separation @xmath17 , which implies that c - pacs will have a performance equivalent to an array that has baseline lengths @xmath32070% larger than the @xmath17 beam separation , depending on the structure function exponent .",
    "the complete analysis contains additional correlation terms and added uncertainties caused by the finite signal - to - noise for the atmospheric calibrator observations .",
    "the ability of c - pacs to correct the atmospheric delays is limited by the delays from the short beam spacings @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see figure  [ c - pacs ] ) , instrumental phase drifts on the reference array , and the radiometer noise .",
    "the delay errors caused by differences in the beam spacings between the science and reference arrays are given statistically by the structure function @xmath20 .",
    "the instrumental errors can be removed by removing a box - car average over the length of the observation , and will contribute negligible delay errors as long as the timescale for the instrumental drifts are large compared to the box - car width .",
    "the delay errors due to radiometric phase noise depend on the strength of the source being observed , the receiver properties , and the atmospheric characteristics @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured phase from radiometer noise is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath23 is the system temperature , @xmath24 is the correlator quantization efficiency , @xmath25 is the effective collecting area of the antennas , @xmath26 is the flux density of the atmospheric calibrator , @xmath27 is the bandwidth of the observations , and @xmath28 is the integration time .",
    "the measurement uncertainty in the delay is then @xmath29 .",
    "the net variance in the delay after applying c - pacs is given by @xmath30 the structure function is generally described by a power law with exponents varying from 5/3 to 2/3 depending upon the spacing and thickness of the turbulent layer .",
    "the scaling coefficient of the power law also varies depending upon the weather conditions . in order for c",
    "- pacs to improve the image quality , the target and reference beams must be close at the turbulent layer such that @xmath31 .",
    "this requires angular separations @xmath325  for the a and b configuration c - pacs pairings and typical winter weather conditions at the carma site .",
    "a future publication will use actual measurements to quantify how the quality of the c - pacs correction varies with angular separation between the science target and the atmospheric calibrator ( zauderer et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the radiometer noise should also contribute much less than a wavelength of delay error for the c - pacs corrections to be successful .",
    "for the characteristics of the 3.5-m telescopes and the 1-cm receivers , the radiometer delay error is given by @xmath33 thus , 1.3-mm observations with integration times of @xmath34  s ( short enough to measure and correct most of the atmosphere fluctuations ) require a reference source brighter than @xmath35  jy in the 1  cm band . when several atmospheric calibrators are available , the optimum choice between calibrator separation and brightness can be found by minimizing equation  [ eq : dtau ] for the expected weather conditions .",
    "we combined the sza 30  ghz calibrator list , the gbt catalog at 1.4 and 5.0  ghz @xcite , and the wmap point source catalog @xcite to estimate the density of potential c - pacs calibrators . for each source in the gbt catalog , we extrapolated the flux density from 5.0  ghz to 30  ghz by measuring the spectral index @xmath10 between 1.4 and 5.0  ghz ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath37 of the sky is within @xmath38 of a point source with flux density greater than @xmath39  jy at 30  ghz .",
    "the number of suitable c - pacs calibrators could be expanded by increasing the sensitivity of the reference array , which would allow us to employ fainter atmospheric calibrators .",
    "this could be accomplished by increasing the correlator bandwidth or improving the receiver sensitivity .",
    "pp  13s * is particularly well suited for c - pacs observations since the nearest atmospheric calibrator ( 3c111 ) is bright ( @xmath34  jy at 1.3  mm at the time of the observations ) and separated by 1.5  from pp  13s*. thus the calibrator satisfies the basic criteria needed for successful c - pacs corrections ( see section  [ calibrators ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we describe the carma observations and data reduction of pp  13s*.      the 6-m and 10-m antennas were used to obtain 1.3  mm continuum observations of pp  13s * on ut dec 5 , 2008 in the carma b configuration and on ut jan 18 , 2009 in the carma a configuration .",
    "double - sideband receivers mounted on each antenna were tuned to a rest frequency of 227  ghz placed in the upper sideband .",
    "the correlator was configured with three 468.75  mhz wide bands to provide 1.41  ghz of continuum bandwidth per sideband .",
    "the observing sequence interleaved 3  min observations of 3c111 with 12  min observations of pp  13s * in b configuration and 4  min in a configuration .",
    "the complex visibilities were recorded every 4  s.    data reduction was performed using the multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display ( miriad ) software package @xcite .",
    "each night of observations was calibrated separately .",
    "the calibration consisted of first applying a line - length correction and then a passband correction derived from observations of 3c111 . only these two calibrations were applied to the millimeter data before proceeding with the c - pacs corrections ( see section [ applying_c - pacs ] ) .",
    "all images that are presented here were formed by inverting the visibility data using natural weighting , and then `` cleaning '' with the point spread function ( i.e. the `` dirty '' beam ) using a hybrid hgbom / clark / steer algorithm @xcite .",
    "the eight 3.5-m antennas were used to obtain 1-cm observations of the atmospheric calibrator simultaneously with the 1.3-mm wavelength observations .",
    "single - sideband receivers mounted on each antenna were tuned to a sky center frequency of 30.4  ghz . for these antennas ,",
    "a wideband correlator is available that was configured with fourteen 500  mhz wide bands to provide 7  ghz of continuum bandwidth .",
    "complex visibilities were recorded every 4  s in order to track the rapidly varying atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "single - sideband system temperatures for the 1-cm observations ranged between 35 and 55  k.    the data calibration consisted of applying a time - dependent passband measured from an electronically correlated noise source that was observed every 60  s. this passband was computed and applied on a 60  s timescale to remove any delay variations in the digitizers due to temperature cycling of the air - conditioning that cools the correlator . a passband correction derived from observations of 3c111",
    "was then applied .",
    "phase referencing would normally be performed at this point in the data reduction process to remove the slowly varying phase drift introduced by the instrument . however , a phase calibration computed over a long time interval , and prior to correcting for the `` fast '' atmospheric delay fluctuations will alias the fast component into a slowly varying error on the phase calibration @xcite .",
    "c - pacs can reduce the errors introduced from standard phase calibration techniques by correcting for both fast and slow atmospheric delay fluctuations .",
    "the delays were extracted from the 1-cm wavelength observations of the atmospheric calibrator , and then applied to each corresponding paired baseline in the science array .",
    "only eight of the 15 antennas from the science array , those paired with a reference antenna , have the c - pacs correction applied .",
    "the delay derived from the reference array is applied to the science target ( pp  13s * ) and phase calibrator ( 3c111 ) on each record .",
    "the delays were computed from the mean phase across all channels in the 1-cm observations divided by the mean frequency .",
    "the observed wavelength of 1  cm used for the reference array is longer than the typical atmospheric delay fluctuations , and delay tracking through phase wraps was not a problem .",
    "the atmospheric delays derived from the 1-cm data were applied directly to the 1.3-mm data without any corrections for differences in the observed frequency .",
    "this is possible since the dispersion in refractivity of water vapor between centimeter and millimeter wavelengths is less than a few percent @xcite away from the strong atmospheric emission lines , and ionospheric effects are negligible at these frequencies @xcite .",
    "the minimal dispersion of the refractivity has also been verified experimentally from the c - pacs observations ( see section  [ 3c111_results ] ) .",
    "after applying the delay corrections to the 1.3  mm data on 4  s intervals , a long - interval ( 10  min ) phase calibration is applied to the 1.3-mm data to remove the slow varying instrumental delay difference from the two different arrays .",
    "the effect of the c - pacs on the calibrated phases can be analyzed in several stages .",
    "we first compare the phase fluctuations measured toward 3c111 at wavelengths of 1  cm and 1.3  mm to demonstrate that the reference and science arrays are tracing the same atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "we then demonstrate that c - pacs yields quantitative improvement in the quality of the pp  13s * star image . throughout this section ,",
    "no absolute flux scale or amplitude calibration are applied to the data in order to evaluate how c - pacs improves the phase stability on the phase calibrator ( section  [ 3c111_results ] ) and pp  13s * ( section  [ pp13s_results ] ) .",
    "figure [ single_baseline ] shows the measured fringe phase toward 3c111 for one paired baseline in the b configuration to illustrate the correlation that exists between the phases measured at wavelengths of 1.3 mm and 1 cm . for this figure ,",
    "the phases measured on the reference array were scaled by the ratio of the observed frequencies ( 227  ghz / 30.4  ghz = 7.5 ) .",
    "the correlation between the 1-cm and 1.3-mm phases is evident over the nearly 8  h time period and is present for all paired baselines .",
    "in addition , the phases are tracked between the two arrays even though the science array is switching between two sources .",
    "these results demonstrate that ( 1 ) the 1-cm phases can be used to track the delay fluctuations at higher frequencies , ( 2 ) the atmosphere is non - dispersive at these wavelengths such that a linear scale with frequency can be used to predict the phases fluctuations at other wavelengths , and ( 3 ) c - pacs can correct the science observations while preserving the link to the phase calibrator observations in the science array .",
    "the observed phases at 227  ghz toward 3c111 on all paired baselines in the a and b configurations are shown as a function of @xmath40-distance - distance is the baseline distance projected perpendicular to the line of sight . ] in figure  [ all_data ] .",
    "the upper panels show the visibility phases measured in 4  s integrations before applying c - pacs corrections , and the middle panels show the visibility phases after applying the corrections .",
    "the rms scatter on the visibility phase before correction is between 33  ( at short @xmath40-distances ) and 53  ( at long @xmath40-distances ) for b configuration and between 26  and 48  for a configuration . after applying the c - pacs correction ,",
    "the phase scatter is reduced to @xmath41 for correction across all @xmath40-distances in both configurations .",
    "another way to grasp the effect of the c - pacs corrections can be seen on the bottom panels in figure  [ all_data ] , where the coherence value ( @xmath42 ) is measured over @xmath40-distance bins of width 130  k@xmath43 . before applying the c - pacs corrections ,",
    "the coherence decreases with increasing baseline length since the longer baselines have larger atmospheric fluctuations . after applying the c - pacs corrections ,",
    "the coherence is uniform with baseline length at a value of @xmath395% .",
    "the coherence becomes nearly constant with baseline length since c - pacs converts the 200 - 1800  m baselines into @xmath330 - 50  m effective baselines for all paired antennas . while the results shown in figure  [ all_data ] emphasize the improvement in coherence , c - pacs also improves the visibility phases , which results in higher image fidelity .      after applying the c",
    "- pacs atmospheric delay corrections to the 1.3-mm data , we removed the instrumental delay drifts by phase referencing to the 3c111 observations .",
    "figure [ pp13s ] shows the resulting maps before and after applying the c - pacs corrections for the a and b configurations separately and the combined data sets .",
    "c - pacs improved the image quality for both the a and b configuration maps as measured by the increase in the peak flux , the reduction in the noise level , and the decrease in the observed source size .",
    "the improved image quality resulted from correcting the phase fluctuations in the 1.3  mm data .",
    "the increase in the source flux and decrease in source size is also illustrated in figure  [ radial_profile ] , which shows radial profile plots across the 1.3  mm emission toward pp  13s * along right ascension and declination . in the combined a+b configuration map , the peak flux measured toward pp  13s *",
    "increased from 42.4  mjy to 67.8  mjy ( a factor of 1.6 ) after applying the c - pacs correction .",
    "the noise level decreased from @xmath44  mjy / beam to @xmath45  mjy / beam , which corresponds to a 36% improvement .",
    "the observed full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) source size diminished from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , or a 52% decrease in the size of the major axis of the 1.3  mm emission .",
    "before proceeding to the analyze the properties of the dust surrounding pp  13s * , we must flux calibrate the c - pacs data .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was set from observations of uranus in b configuration and 3c84 in a configuration .",
    "the flux density of uranus was inferred from a planet model , while the flux density of 3c84 was obtained from carma observations on a different day when both 3c84 and uranus were observed . the uncertainty on this calibration is estimated to be 20% due to uncertainties in the planetary model and the bootstrapped flux for 3c84 .",
    "the antenna gains as a function of time were then determined from the 3c111 observations .",
    "figure [ uvamp ] shows the calibrated visibility amplitude observed toward pp  13s * as a function of baseline length .",
    "an unresolved source will have a constant flux density with baseline length .",
    "by contrast , the visibility amplitude toward pp  13s * decreases with increasing baseline length , which suggests that the source is resolved .",
    "while the decline in amplitude with baseline length could be explained by a coherence as low as @xmath48 on @xmath491-km baselines , the minimum measured coherence on 3c111 at any @xmath40-distance was 0.65 even before applying the c - pacs correction ( see figure [ all_data ] ) . a similar decline in the visibility amplitude for pp  13s * with baseline length",
    "can be seen as well when only a fraction of the data are averaged together ( for example using 1  h of data at a time ) , indicating that atmospheric decorrelation over long timescales is not giving rise to the amplitude drop at long baselines .",
    "thus , the primary cause of the decrease in amplitudes with increasing baseline length is that the source is resolved .",
    "the fwhm of the 1.3  mm continuum emission toward pp  13s * is @xmath50 , which was obtained by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian to the surface brightness distribution in the combined a+b configuration image after applying the c - pacs corrections and deconvolving the synthesized fwhm beam size of @xmath51 .",
    "the integrated flux density of pp  13s * in the c - pacs corrected image after flux and amplitude calibration is @xmath52  mjy , measured by integrating over an aperture of radius @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is defined to encompass 95% of the emission .",
    "the flux observed with carma corresponds to about half of the emission measured by single - dish observations ( 450  mjy at 1.3  mm with a beam size of @xmath55 * ? ? ? * ) . the remaining 1.3  mm flux",
    "is presumably contained in an extended envelope larger than @xmath56 , which is the largest angular scale probed by the carma data .",
    "the presence of a circumstellar disk in pp  13s * has been previously inferred from several lines of evidence : ( i ) reflected light along the outflow axis is observed despite the fact that the central object is heavily obscured in the optical ( @xmath57 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicates that the circumstellar material is not spherically symmetric ; ( ii ) infrared absorption bands at 3  and 10  indicate substantial quantities of cold dust , probably present in an obscured inclined disk @xcite ; and ( iii ) the broad @xmath58 m co overtone absorption feature present in the pp  13s * spectra @xcite can be explained by the presence of a massive accreting circumstellar disk @xcite . nonetheless ,",
    "without observations of the gas kinematics , we can not determine if the dust emission detected by carma originates from the central cusp of an envelope or from the circumstellar disk that surrounds pp  13s*. since the presence of a massive accretion disk has been invoked to explain several characteristics of fu - orionis objects , we assume that the millimeter continuum emission around pp  13s * observed by carma originates primarily from a circumstellar disk .    to determine the disk properties , we assumed the radial surface density [ @xmath59 can be described by the similarity solution for a viscous accretion disk given by @xmath60 \\right ] , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\label{eq : sd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the slope of the disk viscosity ( @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 is the surface density at @xmath64 @xcite .",

    "we find that the disk becomes optically thick inwards of @xmath87  au given the assumptions in the model .",
    "we caution that the surface density distribution within this region is poorly constrained not only because of the high optical depth , but because the disk is unresolved for a radius less than 26  au .",
    "the radius where the dust becomes optically thick is large compared to what is found in disks around classical t tauri stars , where only the inner few astronomical units are opaque at such long wavelength .",
    "furthermore , the transition radius we find for pp  13s * is smaller than any of the pre - main sequence circumstellar disks studied by @xcite .",
    "thus the circumstellar disk of pp  13s * is more concentrated than the disks around classical t - tauri stars .",
    "gravitational instabilities in the disk might be responsible for the enhanced accretion episodes seen in fu - orionis objects @xcite .",
    "to investigate if the disk around pp  13s * is gravitationally unstable , we computed the toomre s @xmath88 parameter : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the sound speed and @xmath91 is the epicyclic frequency ( which is equal to the angular velocity for a keplerian disk ) .",
    "a disk becomes gravitationally unstable if @xmath92 , as spiral waves develop and mass is transported inwards and momentum is transported outwards @xcite .    as shown in figure  [ toomre ] , the pp  13 * disk is gravitationally stable to axisymmetric perturbations across all radii for the inferred surface density .",
    "the disk surface density would need to be increased by more than an order of magnitude ( see dashed line of figure [ toomre ] ) for the disk to develop a gravitational instability .",
    "the inferred disk surface density can vary widely depending on the adopted dust properties , as composition , grain size distribution ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , emissivity index ( @xmath96 ) and dust - to - gas ratio , all affect the resulting opacity .",
    "for example , @xmath97 diminishes by 20 - 30% if ices are ignored from the dust composition , increasing the surface density by the same percentage . also , flattening the grain distribution slope to @xmath98 gives a 30% increase in the disk mass .",
    "furthermore , we adopted a fixed power - law ( @xmath96 ) of the dust opacity law .",
    "if @xmath96 decreases toward the center of the system ( as observed in class 0 sources ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can expect to have larger grains in the circumstellar disk that will reduce the mass opacity and increase the surface density . despite the uncertainties in the dust properties",
    ", it will be difficult to increase the surface density by more than an order of magnitude at a radius @xmath99  au where the disk is optically thin , unless the dust properties of pp  13s * are extraordinarily different from what is found in typical disks @xcite .",
    "we have described c - pacs , which uses paired antennas as a means to calibrate the atmospheric phase fluctuations on long interferometric baselines . specifically ,",
    "while the 6 and 10-m carma antennas observe a science source in the 3-mm or 1-mm atmospheric windows , the 3.5-m carma antennas simultaneously observe a nearby atmospheric calibrator in the 1-cm band .",
    "the 3.5-m antennas are placed within 30  m of the larger antennas to sample similar atmospheric delay fluctuations .",
    "we have applied the calibration technique to carma observations of the circumstellar material around the fu  orionis object pp  13s@xmath100 .",
    "c - pacs yields quantitative improvement in the image quality of pp  13s@xmath100 : the observed peak flux increased by a factor of 1.6 , the image noise level decreased by 36% , and the fwhm of the major axis decreased by 52% .",
    "the improvement in the phase error and amplitude coherence provided by the paired antennas technique is a function of the projected beam separation of the antenna pairs at the height of the turbulent layer , and the radiometric noise introduced from the reference array to the science array .",
    "thus , the brightness of the atmospheric calibrator and the angular separation between the atmospheric calibrator and the science target are the main restrictions to the application of this technique for general science observations .",
    "our current estimate requires a calibrator closer than @xmath38 to the science target and brighter than 1  jy at 30  ghz to correct 1.3  mm observations .",
    "based on existing radio catalogs , we estimate that there are 420 sources that have @xmath101  jy , such that 50% of the sky can be observed with a suitable calibrator .    with c",

    "we constrain the surface density profile of pp  13s * using a self - consistent disk model .",
    "the main difference in the inferred disk properties compared to disks around other pre - main sequence circumstellar disks is that the dust is more centrally concentrated and there is a larger region that is optically thick at millimeter wavelengths . from analysis of the toomre @xmath88 parameter , we find that the disk is gravitationally stable over all disk radii unless the disk surface density is underestimated by an order of magnitude or more",
