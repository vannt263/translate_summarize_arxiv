    "there is no evidence for clumping on angular scales smaller than 10 , as had been earlier found for molecular hydrogen emission @xcite .",
    "the 20  resolution image shows the emission with a higher dynamical range . in the remainder of the paper only images with this angular resolution are considered .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec - vla ] , there is evidence for extended emission not detected by the vla .",

    "@xcite derived a temperature range of 100300  k. another lower limit on the temperature is the line intensity of the co(76 ) line measured by @xcite , which indicates a temperature of @xmath33  k. in pdr models , the higher co lines originate from about the same depth in the pdr as the carbon recombination line ( i.  e.  the surface of the c@xmath0/c / co transition zone ) .",
    "these estimates are close to the upper limit inferred from the line width above .",
    "this agreement could suggest that the major line broadening agent is thermal and that the turbulent broadening is less than @xmath34 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this value is in contrast to the situation in neighboring molecular layers ( see sect .  [ sec - molecules ] ) deeper in the pdr where the temperature is likely to be lower ; without turbulent broadening the widths of the molecular lines would be considerably smaller than the  line widths but are observed to be similar to the  line width .",
    "we conclude that the alfvn waves or other turbulent agents which give rise to non - thermal broadening in the molecular gas do not penetrate very much into the higher ionization degree layer associated with the  emission .",
    "similar conditions may prevail in the reflection nebula ngc  7023 where the 100-m observation of  ( see appendix ) indicate a rather similar limit on the temperature .",
    "thus , we conclude that the temperature in the ionized carbon layers of pdrs excited by early b - stars with incident radiation fields similar to that estimated in ngc  2023 ( smaller than @xmath35 times the average interstellar fuv field ) is likely to be of order 200  k or lower .",
    "the observed spectral range covers the frequency of the sulfur ( as well as si and mg ) radio recombination lines .",
    "this line has been detected in several pdrs @xcite but not in the orion bar or ngc  2023 .",
    "no s91@xmath36 lines were detected in the vla data by averaging over carbon line emission regions , in which the   line was detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 .",
    "therefore the @xmath37 upper limit for the ratio of sulfur to carbon line intensities is 0.2 , consistent with solar abundances ( * ? ? ?",

    "* c / h=1.4@xmath38 ) and solar abundance for s. however , this limit rules out strong deviations from the c / s cosmic abundance ratio due to depletion of carbon on grains which was earlier found for s88b by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ c65a ] shows the  carbon recombination line spectrum observed toward ngc  2023 .",
    "this observation is the highest frequency at which the carbon line in ngc  2023 has been detected to date .",
    "based on this detection it is possible to constrain the departure coefficients for principle quantum numbers @xmath40 between 65 and 91 ; thus , in principle , the density and temperature in the pdr can be constrained .",
    "the  vla total flux corrected image was convolved to a 40  beam and a ratio of the integrated intensities @xmath41 of  and  of @xmath42 was estimated .",
    "the ratio of departure coefficients @xmath43 ( see eq .  7.3 of @xcite for the case with no continuum ) is : @xmath44 we conclude that for a temperature @xmath45 of 150  k based on the above discussion , the measured intensity ratio implies @xmath46 .",
    "this value compares with a value of 1.52 for @xmath43 expected on the basis of conventional hydrogenic recombination theory @xcite with an electron density in the range 330 @xmath2  and temperature @xmath47  k. hence , we can not explain this result by conventional hydrogenic recombination theory . as was the case for the orion bar @xcite",

    "these ratios are clearly different from the values expected in the optically thin lte limit ( 1:0.6:0.2 ) and moreover the @xmath49 ratio is @xmath50 and thus incompatible with the ratios expected in lte at any optical depth .",
    "such anomalies in the hcn @xmath51 hyperfine satellite line ratios are well known @xcite and can be explained as being due to the combination of moderate opacity and line overlap .",

    "moderate opacity is also suggested by the fact that the line profiles of hcn and  agree .",
    "the northern clump ( upper panel ) shows a line width of 0.8  km s@xmath17 , whereas the southern clump ( lower panel ) splits up into two velocity components separated by 1.6 km s@xmath17 . this latter result suggests the presence of at least two clumps of higher density material with differing velocities immersed in the pdr .    for the hcn and ( 10 ) lines ,",
    "the upper energies and critical densities are quite similar .",
    "hence changes in the relative intensities should reflect changes in the relative abundances of the two molecules .",
    "[ ratio ] shows the ratio of hcn and   emission superimposed on the integrated  image . toward the emission peaks ,",
    "the hcn/  ratio is reduced by a factor of two compared to the surroundings . in the southern clump",
    ", there is evidence for a gradient of the hcn/  ratio , decreasing from 0.8 at the northern edge to 0.3 to the south .",
    "@xcite have constructed chemical models which include hcn and  using densities and temperatures similar to ngc  2023 . in their models",
    "the  abundance decreases significantly for @xmath54 due to the increasing electronic abundance .",
    "this effect might explain the increased hcn/  ratio toward the edges of the pdr .      within the observed mosaic , one resolved millimeter continuum source is detected at ( 19 , 106 ) offset from hd  37903 ( fig .",

    "the deconvolved size of the emission is 12  ( 0.028  pc ) with an integrated flux density of 36@xmath557  mjy .",

    "thus , thermal dust emission must be the primary mechanism for the 3  mm continuum . using the equation for the corresponding mass given by @xcite with the dust cross section estimates by @xcite for dust with ice mantles , a dust opacity index of 2 , and a temperature of 20  k",

    "comm . ) and the  and hcn line emission .",
    "the 3  mm source is coincident with compact 850  @xmath12 m emission detected by scuba , confirming the interpretation that the source is caused by dust emission .",
    "indeed it seems likely to be a cold `` prestellar core '' , as the scuba detection is consistent with a temperature of 20  k. no iras source is at this position , however the iras images of this region are very confused .",
    "there seems to be a source associated with the core in a recent isocam image of ngc  2023 ( nordh et al .",

    "this extinction is still far smaller then the one derived for the millimeter core . hence , the star seems to lie in the foreground of the dense millimeter clump , but is still considerably embedded in the outer portion of the clump to account for the reddening .",

    "we conclude that this density must be significantly higher than @xmath1 @xmath2 .",

    "these facts argue that the core is cold and therefore starless .",
    "molecules seem to be frozen - out onto grain surfaces , since no prominent molecular line emission is detected in the direction of the core .",
    "the findings suggest that the dust core detected by bima is in the process of collapsing to form a protostar .",
    "observations in other tracers can be important in order to test whether the absence of associated hcn and  is a general phenomenon or is confined to those two species .",
    "the detection of molecular lines associated with the object would considerably help in understanding its evolutionary state . from the density estimate of @xmath3 @xmath2  inferred from the continuum results ,",
    "we derive a free  fall time of @xmath35 years .",
    "this time is an order of magnitude less than the timescale expected for evolution of the pdr taking a size scale of 0.04 parsec and a velocity of 0.5  km s@xmath17 .",
    "a possible scenario is that the dust core formed within the pdr with the formation triggered by the higher pressures resulting from the pdr heating . on the other hand",
    ", there is no evidence for interaction of the fuv radiation field with the bima / scuba core in the form of  emission .",
    "however , the radiation field does seem to be interacting with the clump to the ne observed in  and hcn and it seems unlikely that the two clumps are adjacent only due to a chance projection .",
