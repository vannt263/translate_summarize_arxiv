    "after more than 30 years of experimental investigation , the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remains unknown .",
    "the simplest picture of ewsb employs a scalar field , the higgs , whose vacuum expectation value provides masses for the standard model ( sm ) @xmath14 , @xmath15 bosons , as well as for the fermions .",
    "experiments have yet to find this particle , even though generic expectations place it within the reach of recent searches .",
    "direct searches @xcite place the lower limit on the higgs mass of @xmath16 tev , whereas a global fit to the precision electroweak data set @xcite places the indirect upper bound of @xmath17 gev at 95% cl .    on a more theoretical level",
    ", a weak scale higgs scalar seems unnatural , as its mass is typically expected to receive large radiative corrections from uv physics .",
    "thus , a hierarchy problem arises , as there seem to be much higher scales present in nature , such as the planck scale of gravity , @xmath18 gev .",
    "this problem may be resolved by the addition of new physics at the weak scale , such as higgs compositeness , strong dynamics ( technicolor ) , or supersymmetry .",
    "none of these proposals have been experimentally verified , and they also suffer from various phenomenological problems .    over the past few years , the possibility of extra spatial dimensions has been exploited to address the hierarchy conundrum . in particular , the warped 5-dimensional ( 5-d ) randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite , which is based on a truncated @xmath19 spacetime , offers a natural geometric setup for explaining the size of the weak scale . in this model ,",
    "the weak scale is generated exponentially from the curvature of the extra dimensional space .",
    "the ads / cft conjecture in string theory @xcite suggests that the rs model is dual to a 4-d strongly interacting field theory .",
    "the higgs in the 5-d picture is then identified with a dual 4-d composite scalar .",
    "it has been recently proposed @xcite that one could use the boundary conditions of a 5-d flat space su(2)@xmath0 su(2)@xmath1 u(1)@xmath2 theory to generate masses for @xmath14 and @xmath15 bosons of the sm , in the absence of a higgs scalar .",
    "this proposal predicted unacceptably large deviations from precision ew data and seemed to be excluded .",
    "however in ref.@xcite , this higgsless approach to ewsb was studied in the context of the rs geometry , and agreement with data was much improved .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the model contains a custodial su(2 ) symmetry , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite which is broken only by terms of size of order the spatial variance of the bulk @xmath20 and @xmath15 wavefunctions . in the warped geometry , these wavefunctions are nearly flat over most of the bulk , as opposed to the @xmath21(1 ) spatial variance in the case of flat space .",
    "using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , one may think of this proposal as a technicolor model without a higgs scalar .",
    "this duality also addresses the improved agreement of the warped model with data , since the global su(2)@xmath0 su(2)@xmath22 symmetry in the bulk provides the equivalent of a 4-d custodial symmetry that suppresses corrections to the ew observables . here , we note that even though this construct is dual to some strong dynamics , the warped 5-d geometry could in principle provide a computationally controlled theory , with quantitative predictions .",
    "in this paper , we study a 5-d warped higgsless model ( whm ) , employing a set of parameters that is more general than those used in the original model of ref.@xcite . in particular , we allow for independent bulk gauge couplings to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge sectors , which is crucial in getting good agreement with the precision ew data . we also include the effects of uv boundary gauge kinetic terms , assuming that they are radiatively generated @xcite .",
    "we do not specify a mechanism for fermion mass generation , but adopt a simple parametrization that could accommodate a large class of possible scenarios .",
    "in addition , our analysis incorporates all higher order corrections from the curvature of the 5-d space that were ignored in the initial work@xcite",
    ".    we will demonstrate that with typical values for the model parameters , good agreement with the precision ew data can be achieved .",
    "however , we have found that perturbative unitarity in @xmath23 gauge boson scattering is violated throughout the entire model parameter space . in particular , for the region where the good agreement with precision measurements is obtained , we find that unitarity is violated at @xmath24 tev , which is below the mass of the new states studied by csaki  @xcite .",
    "we thus find that this model is not reliably predictive in its present form .",
    "however , assuming that unitarity can be restored by an appropriate modification of this scenario , , with the inclusion of additional non - higgs states , we then consider the collider signatures which should be present in any generic whm .",
    "in particular , we find that the gauge boson kaluza klein ( kk ) excitations of the strong and electroweak sectors are observable at the lhc . however , it is unlikely that the lhc experiments will be able to detect the spin-2 graviton kk resonances which constitute the most distinct signature of the conventional rs - based models .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce our formalism and notation .",
    "we then determine the couplings of the various kk towers to the sm fields in section 3 .",
    "our predictions for the ew observables and the resulting parameter space constraints are given in section 4 .",
    "unitarity is examined in section 5 and the collider signatures of the model are discussed in section 6 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "in the analysis that follows , we will , for the most part , follow the notation of csaki @xcite with some modifications that are necessary to make contact with our previous work @xcite .",
    "for this reason we now review the rs metric in both notations . in the original rs scheme ( employed in our earlier work ) , the 5-d metric is given by ds^2=g_mndx^m dx^n = e^-2_dx^dx^-dy^2 , [ rsmetric ] with uppercase roman indices extending over 5-dimensional space - time and greek indices corresponding to 4-d . here , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the compactification radius , @xmath27 is the curvature scale associated with the 5-d space , and @xmath28 with @xmath29 parameterizing the 5th coordinate . for numerical purposes we will take @xmath30 throughout our analysis .",
    "the geometrical setup contains 2 branes , one residing at @xmath31 ( known as the planck brane ) and one at @xmath32 ( the tev brane ) , , the branes are located at the boundaries of the 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath33 , which represents the scale of physical processes on the tev brane . in the scheme used in ref .",
    "@xcite , this metric is rewritten as ds^2 = ( rz ) ^2 ( _ dx^dx^- dz^2 ) , [ csakimetric ] with @xmath34 . here",
    ", we see that the relationships @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 converts one form of the metric to the other . in this convention ,",
    "the planck ( tev ) brane resides at @xmath38 .",
    "it is important to note that the range @xmath34 maps onto only _ half _ of the @xmath28 interval . when employing the csaki  notation in what follows , we will normalize our wavefunctions over twice the @xmath34 interval for consistency with our earlier work .    in the whm ,",
    "the gauge theory in the bulk is su(3)@xmath39 su(2)@xmath40 su(2)@xmath41 u(1)@xmath2",
    "for which the bulk action is given by s = d^4xdy _ i -14g^2_5if^i_abf_i^ab , [ bulkaction ] where we have suppressed the group indices , @xmath42 , the sum extends over the four gauge groups , and @xmath43 are the appropriate 5-d coupling constants .",
    "note that for generality , we allow for the possibility of @xmath44 in our analysis below .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen such that the gauge symmetry breaking chain su(2)@xmath41 u(1)@xmath45 u(1)@xmath46 occurs at the planck scale and subsequently the gauge symmetry breaking su(2)@xmath40 u(1)@xmath47 u(1)@xmath48 takes place at the tev scale .",
    "this hierarchical two - step breaking scheme is analogous to that of the usual breaking pattern of the conventional left - right symmetric model @xcite .",
    "after the gauge symmetry is broken at the planck scale , a global su(2)@xmath1 su(2)@xmath49 symmetry remains in the brane picture .",
    "this global symmetry is broken on the tev brane to a diagonal group , su(2)@xmath50 , which corresponds to the su(2 ) custodial symmetry present in the sm .",
    "it is the presence of this custodial symmetry which essentially preserves the tree - level value of unity for the @xmath51 parameter in this model . of the 7 generators present in the high - scale electroweak sector ,",
    "3 are broken near , 3 are broken near the tev scale , leaving one generator for u(1)@xmath48 as in the sm .",
    "su(3)@xmath52 , of course , remains unbroken and is simply the 5-d analog of qcd .",
    "in addition to the bulk action above , significant boundary ( brane ) terms can exist in this scenario @xcite which can be generated via quantum contributions @xcite .",
    "the only sizable effects arise at @xmath53 , , on the planck brane , due to the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) between the physical scales associated with the two branes , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "since the gauge group below the scale @xmath27 is simply su(3)@xmath56 su(2)@xmath40 u(1)@xmath46 , only these gauge fields will have brane localized kinetic terms , which we may write as s_brane = d^4xdy ( y)\\ { -14g^2_l f_l^f^l_-14g^2_yf_y^f^y _ -14g^2_sf_c^f^c _ } , [ blktaction ] where = _ i8 ^ 2(kke^-kr_c ) = _",

    "if only sm fields are present in the model , then @xmath59 ; we will assume these values in our numerical analysis .",
    "note that due to the large logarithms , these coefficients can be significant , of @xmath60 or larger , and will lead to important effects as will be seen below .    in our earlier analysis @xcite , we introduced the notation r_c c_i 2_ik , ( i = l , y , s ) [ dhrnote ] which is useful for quantifying the size of the brane kinetic terms .",
    "given the above relations for @xmath61 , and the assumption that only sm fields contribute to the beta functions , one can show that @xmath62 is not an independent parameter , but is directly calculable .",
    "( we will return to the case of 5-d qcd later . ) from eq .",
    "( [ tildeg ] ) we have = -2 1g^2_l , where the factor of @xmath63 arises from the ratio @xmath64 .",

    "various phenomenological aspects of a higgsless 5-d model @xcite , based on the rs hierarchy proposal @xcite , were studied in this paper .",

    "these terms were assumed to be radiatively generated , which is a generic expectation in orbifold models @xcite .",

    "@xcite , and also allowed for a more general set of parameters than that discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we computed the mass spectrum and the relevant couplings of the @xmath89 and @xmath264 kk towers , and studied experimental constraints on the model parameters .",
    "our main conclusion is that in the region of parameter space allowed by precision ew data , this model is not perturbatively unitary at tree level above @xmath372 tev , which is below the scale of the new kk states .",
    "futhermore , we find that tree - level unitarity is violated over the entire parameter space , even in those regions where comparisons with the precision measurements are anticipated to be quite poor .",
    "thus , to make reliable calculations based on the whm , one must extend this model in order to unitarize the amplitudes . setting the issue of perturbative unitarity aside",
    ", it was also observed that quantum contributions to the @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath254 oblique parameters @xcite are expected to be small .",
    "however , in the absence of the higgs , regularization of the relevant loop diagrams may require non - renormalizable tev brane counter terms whose coefficients are unknown .",
    "this imposes a degree of uncertainty on loop corrections .",
    "further work regarding loop corrections is needed before more precise statements could be made in this regard .    finally , we considered the collider signatures of the model , assuming that unitarity could somehow be restored without significantly modifying our numerical results .",
    "these signatures depend on the 5-d configuration of bulk fermions .",
    "we assumed a simple setup , where all fermions , except perhaps for the third generation , are localized near the planck brane .",
    "the effect of different localizations of quarks was then taken into account by varying the widths of the kk resonances .",
    "generically , we found that the low - lying gauge boson kk modes , including the gluons , would be observable , whereas the most distinct rs signature , the spin-2 graviton kk resonances , would most likely evade detection at the lhc .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides a 4-d interpretation of this model in terms of strong dynamics .",
    "thus , the tools and insights of both five and four dimensional model building can be employed in making this scenario more realistic such that it agrees with the sm at low energies .",
    "this setup provides an entirely higher dimensional explanation of the observed weak interaction mass scales , directly linking them to the ir scale in the rs model .",
    "thus , it is worth the effort to find solutions for the problems that plague the present form of the whm .",
