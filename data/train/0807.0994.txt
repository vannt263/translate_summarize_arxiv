    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite there are two scalar superpartners @xmath16 and @xmath17 , of the top quark which are the weak eigenstates .",
    "the mass eigenstates the lighter top squark ( @xmath0 ) and the heavier top squark ( @xmath18 ) are linear combinations of the weak eigenstates . due to",
    "mixing effects in the top squark mass matrix in the weak basis driven by the top quark mass ( @xmath19 ) there may be a significant mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",
    "in fact the former could very well be the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath4 ) being the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) by the standard assumption in r - parity conserving mssm .",
    "this happens in a wide region of the mssm parameter space . in this scenario , henceforth referred to as the @xmath0 - nlsp scenario , the @xmath0 may be the only strongly interacting superpartner within the kinematic reach of tevatron run ii experiments with a relatively large production cross - section .",
    "additional interest in the light top - squark scenario stems from the observation that the mssm can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg ) provided @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the search for @xmath0 is , therefore , a high priority program for the on going experiments at the tevatron .",
    "the search for @xmath0-nlsp at tevatron run i and lep and , more recently , at tevatron run ii produced negative results and lower bounds on @xmath11 .",
    "most of the analyses @xcite are based on the assumption that @xmath0 decays via the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) induced loop decay , @xmath5 @xcite with 100 @xmath6 branching ratio ( br )",
    ". we also employ this assumption which is by and large valid if tan@xmath20 where tan @xmath21 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values for the two neutral higgs bosons present in the mssm@xcite . for lower values of this parameter",
    "the four body decay of the @xmath0 may be a competing channel @xcite    there are decay modes of the @xmath0 - nlsp other than the above two channels .",
    "they are the tree - level two body decay , @xmath22 and the three body decay , @xmath23 .",
    "the last modes are kinematically forbidden for small values of the mass difference @xmath24 which is the main concern of this paper .    the search for @xmath0-nlsp are based on the jets plus missing @xmath25 channel@xcite .",
    "some of the more recent works employed c - jet tagging by a lifetime based heavy flavour algorithm .",
    "these jets become softer if @xmath7 is small . as a result the efficiency of the kinematical cuts for suppressing the background as well as that of c - jet tagging decreases .",
    "this weakens the limit on @xmath11 from tevatron . at tevatron",
    "run i the largest @xmath11 excluded was @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the most recent analysis by the d0 collaboration at run ii @xcite with c - jet tagging obtained the limit @xmath28 @xmath29 for @xmath30for the most conservative cross - section after including the next to leading order ( nlo ) corrections @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the lep lower - bounds on @xmath11 are restricted mainly due to kinematics and are around @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , much smaller values of @xmath7 can be probed in the cleaner environment of an @xmath32 collider .",
    "the prospect of @xmath0 - nlsp search via this decay channel at run ii was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was observed that a large region of the @xmath11 - @xmath3 parameter space corresponding to small @xmath7 is beyond the reach of run ii . for a given @xmath11",
    "there is a minimum value of @xmath7 that can yield an observable signal .    a modified strategy for @xmath0-nlsp searches in the limit of small @xmath7 is important in its own right .",
    "the current interest in this search , however , is further strengthened by one of the cornerstones of the interface between particle physics and cosmology . a very attractive feature of the r - parity conserving mssm is that the lsp ( @xmath4 ) , is a very good candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe required , e.g , by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite .",
    "the dm relic density depends on the annihilation cross - section ( thermally averaged ) of a lsp pair .",
    "the coannihilation of the lsp with any other supersymmetric particle(sparticle)is another important mechanism for relic density production .",
    "this mechanism is , however , efficient only when the two coannihilating particles have approximately the same mass .",
    "thus in the small @xmath7 scenario @xmath0 - lsp coannihilation may indeed be an important mechanism for producing appropriate relic density @xcite .",
    "the region of the parameter space of mssm consistent with the dm relic density is severely constrained by the wmap data .",
    "nevertheless even in more restricted versions of the mssm like the minimal supergravity model(msugra ) @xcite one finds a narrow region of the parameter space where @xmath0 - lsp coannihilation is an important relic density producing mechanism@xcite .",
    "the search for @xmath0-nlsp with a small @xmath7 is , therefore , important irrespective of the question of ewbg .",
    "however , it is certainly worthwhile to check whether @xmath0 with mass in the quoted range preferred by ewbg can also produce an acceptable dm relic density .",
    "this was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was found that in a significant region of the allowed parameter space @xmath7 is indeed small ( see figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the results of @xcite were illustrated by specific choices of other mssm parameters .",
    "in particular ewbg in the mssm requires certain cp violating ( cpv ) phases . in a certain phase convention the relative phase(@xmath33 ) between the higgsino mass parameter @xmath34 and the su(2 ) gaugino mass @xmath35 is the most important one .",
    "ewbg usually requires 0.05 @xmath36 1 . however , various uncertainties in the calculation does not rule out a much smaller magnitude of this phase .",
    "thus calculations by neglecting this phase seems to be a reasonable approximation@xcite .",
    "it should , however , be emphasized that the signal proposed by us is fairly model independent and does not depend on the cpv phase or many of the other mssm parameters at all as long as the br(@xmath5 ) is close to 100% . under this assumption",
    "the size of the signal depends on @xmath11 through the production cross - section of the @xmath0 pair via the standard qcd processes and on @xmath3 through the efficiency of the kinematical cuts .",
    "the starting point of our work is the observation that when mass difference @xmath7 is small , in most of the signal events , one of the @xmath37-quarks from @xmath0 pair decay is not energetic enough to produce a jet which may pass jet selection criteria of the experiments at tevatron .",
    "it may be seen as an isolated energy deposit in the calorimeter coming from the decay of a heavy particle .",
    "we call it _ isolated cluster _ ( _ ic _ ) .",
    "thus the proposed signal consists of a c - jet of modest @xmath38 accompanied by missing energy and an _",
    "isolated cluster_. in order to reduce the background we require another hard jet in the signal which in most cases comes from qcd radiation .",
    "our simulations show that a set of selection criteria based on the above features of the signal can isolate it from the sm background .    in this work",
    "we do not consider the prospect of fully identifying the flavour of the heavy , isolated , decaying object because of the rather small statistics .",
    "this leads to inevitable backgrounds from , e.g. , @xmath39 events and w / z + jets events .",
    "however , we shall analyze at the generator level some important characteristics of this object which has the potential of reducing the sm backgrounds to a manageable level . at the same time we emphasize that this work is only suggestive of a new approach to @xmath0 search at the tevatron and needs detailed detector simulation for a more definitive statement and that is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we have used pythia ( v 6.206 ) @xcite for generation of both signal and background events which includes generation of the parton level events followed by the decay of the partons hadronization and decay of their daughters .",
    "generation of both signal and background events take into account initial state radiation ( isr ) and final state radiation ( fsr ) .",
    "the cross - sections @xmath43 and @xmath44 are very large and most of these events generated with low @xmath45 are not relevant for our analysis . to sample the @xmath39 and @xmath46 events better for our purpose and save computer time we have used a cut @xmath47 for generation of @xmath39 and @xmath46 events , where @xmath48 is defined in the cm frame of the colliding partons .",
    "we have used the toy calorimeter simulation followed by jet formation in pythia ( pycell ) .    1 .",
    "the calorimeter coverage is @xmath49 .",
    "a cone algorithm with @xmath50 has been used for jet finding with @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 and jets have been ordered in @xmath38 .",

    "5 .   for jets containing a @xmath58 or a @xmath59 hadron",
    "we have used their decay length information for determining the presence of a long lived particle .",
    "a quark or a gluon from ( mainly ) fsr is seen as a jet and in most cases this jet appears to have the highest @xmath38 .",
    "this prompts us to consider a rather unusual signature for the signal events as mentioned below .",
    "the backgrounds , particularly @xmath39 and @xmath46 events have very large cross - sections and hence we need to generate a large number of events and retain only a small fraction of them which pass pre - selection for detailed analysis .",
    "we have used the following pre - selection criteria :    1 .",
    "event should have only two jets : @xmath60 ( see figure [ fig : njet ] ) 2 .",
    "events with isolated leptons are rejected .",
    "one of the jets should contain a long lived particle ( @xmath58 or , @xmath59 hadron ) and henceforth called _ matched - jet _ ( mj ) .",
    "4 .   event should have an _ isolated cluster _ resulting from the decay of a @xmath58 or @xmath59 hadron such that @xmath61 .",
    "the direction of the _ isolated cluster _ is defined to be the direction of the decaying _ b _ or _ d _ hadron . in the final selection",
    "this cluster has to be identified as the signature of a long lived particle , the criteria for which are discussed in detail later .",
    "we assume that a _ b - jet _ with @xmath62 is tagged with a probability @xmath63 and for @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the single @xmath67-jet tagging efficiency ( i.e. , the ratio of the number of tagged @xmath67-jets and the number of taggable @xmath67-jets ) .",
    "the pre - selection efficiency for the signal events is rather small : for @xmath68 ( a ) only @xmath69 events survives pre - selection ; for @xmath70 ( b ) and @xmath71 ( c ) the rates are @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively . for @xmath74 , @xmath39 , @xmath46 and _ v + jet _ events ( _ v = w , z _ ) rates are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively ( see table [ tab : single ] for details )",

    "all background cross - sections have been computed by calchep ( version 2.3.7 ) @xcite at @xmath83 .",

    "we expect the _ isolated cluster _ and the _ matched - jet _ to be approximately back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "so , the cut @xmath93 ( see figure [ fig : phi_diff ] ) rejects background , particularly _ w+jets _ and _ z+jets _ events .",
    "the _ matched - jet _ is most likely to be the leading jet in _ w+jets _ and _ z+jets _ events whereas it is the 2nd jet in the signal events .",

    ". the combined effect of these cuts ( cut 5 ) for the signal and the dominant backgrounds is shown in column 8 of table [ tab : single ] .",
    "although a very high rejection factor of ( @xmath99 ) is achieved for the @xmath39 events and no event in the simulated sample survives , this may still be dangerous as @xmath43 is very large . since the signal events do not have spectacular signatures ,",
    "it is not possible to apply more stringent criterion on any of the features and still retain a good signal .",
    "it may be required to exploit the subtle features of the _ matched - jet _ and the _ isolated cluster _ to get rid of the @xmath39 events .",
    "there are a few features which may be exploited to this end although it may be experimentally challenging :    * number of charged tracks associated with the _",
    "isolated cluster_. * upper cut on the lifetime related observables for the _ matched - jet _ , expected to be a _ c - jet _ and the _ isolated cluster _ , expected to come from the decay of a @xmath59 hadron in the signal . *",

    "* more reliable reconstruction of the invariant masses using full detector information .",
    "since these observables are rather _ delicate _ , they may be simulated only using detailed detector modelling and estimation of the effects of criteria based on these observables is beyond the scope of this analysis .",
