    "quantum entanglement , one of the most fundamental and intriguing features of quantum mechanics , is well recognized as an essential resource for quantum information processing and transmission @xcite .",
    "it has recently acquired an important role also in many - body and condensed matter physics @xcite , where it provides a new perspective for analyzing quantum correlations and quantum phase transitions , as well as in other fields like the foundations of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the study of entanglement in interacting spin models has in particular attracted much interest @xcite , since they provide a basic scalable qubit representation suitable for implementing quantum processing tasks and are at the same time able to capture the main features of diverse physical systems .",
    "some of these models can in addition be exactly solved for any size , providing hence a suitable scenario for testing the accuracy of approximate descriptions .",
    "an example is that of a symmetric array of @xmath0 fully connected spins ( simplex ) with anisotropic @xmath1 type couplings embedded in a uniform transverse magnetic field . this is a solvable yet non - trivial model which exhibits a quantum phase transition at @xmath2 , whose hamiltonian is formally equivalent to that of the well - known lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite .",
    "it has attracted renewed interest in recent years , having been used to describe diverse physical systems such as josephson junction arrays @xcite and two mode bose einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "its zero temperature entanglement properties were analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown in particular that the pairwise concurrence , a measure of the entanglement between two spins @xcite , exhibited a rich behavior when properly scaled , with a cusplike maximum at the critical field in the ferromagnetic case and a smooth decrease for large fields @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will examine the _ thermal _ pairwise entanglement in this system , together with its description in the framework of the mean field + random phase approximation ( rpa ) derived from the path integral representation of the partition function @xcite .",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first , we want to determine its thermal behavior and stability , a relevant aspect in physical realizations . secondly , given the complexity of determining the entanglement properties in general interacting many - body systems at finite temperature , we want to examine the extent to which its main features can be captured by a general tractable method like the rpa , which takes into account just small amplitude quantum fluctuations around the mean field .",
    "we will show that the present rpa treatment provides , for anisotropic couplings , an accurate analytic description of both the parallel and antiparallel thermal pairwise entanglement in large systems , generalizing the results of @xcite for the @xmath3 case ( where entanglement is just antiparallel ) .",
    "the limit temperature will be shown to decrease only logarithmically with increasing @xmath0 at all fields , for the standard @xmath4 scaling of coupling strengths , and to exhibit a different field dependence in the parallel and antiparallel sectors .",
    "in particular , it _ increases _ for large increasing fields , despite the decrease of the @xmath2 concurrence ( and at variance with the behavior in the @xmath3 case @xcite ) , entailing just a finite separable field window at any temperature .",
