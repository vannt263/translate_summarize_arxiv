    "gauge invariance of the electroweak interactions in particular forbids mass terms for all known elementary particles ( except for right - handed neutrinos ) . in reality , all particles but the photon are massive , so the electroweak @xmath1 gauge symmetry is softly broken .",
    "it is manifest in the interactions , but hidden in the mass spectrum .",
    "the masses of vector bosons are best understood as mixing terms .",
    "the electroweak gauge bosons which form a @xmath2 triplet @xmath3 and a @xmath2 singlet @xmath4 , are coupled to a multiplet of _ scalar _ states in a different representation of the electroweak symmetry group .",
    "diagonalizing the mass matrix , the resulting eigenstates consist of the massless photon and the three massive vector bosons @xmath5 and  @xmath6 .",
    "their longitudinal components can be identified with three components of the scalar multiplet .",
    "similarly , the ( dirac ) masses and mixings of the fermions originate from bilinear couplings of left - handed and right - handed two - component ( weyl ) fermions , which are otherwise unrelated and belong to different @xmath1 representations .",
    "the three scalar states ( i.e. , the longitudinal vector bosons ) in the observed spectrum do not make up a complete linear representation of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , a field theory based just on the degrees of freedom that have been established experimentally is non - renormalizable .",
    "we can make use of such an effective theory to get a consistent low - energy expansion of the relevant physics@xcite .",
    "this formalism will be described below in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] .",
    "however , at high energies a non - renormalizable theory has an inherent cutoff scale where it ceases to be predictive .",
    "for instance , the scalars may turn out as composite at the cutoff scale , or there may be additional scalars which have not yet been observed . in any case , the pattern of mass generation via mixing suggests a new interaction , and the complexity of the flavor couplings indicates a similar complexity of this new _ higgs _",
    "sector@xcite , of which we might just be scratching the surface . in the standard model and its extensions the problem",
    "is solved by _",
    "brute force _ , postulating the existence of scalar multiplets with just the appropriate quantum numbers and couplings@xcite , but this need not be the solution chosen by nature .",
    "since the actual properties of the higgs sector are unknown , in a first approach one may identify a parameter @xmath7 as the characteristic scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , by convention taken as @xmath8 @xmath7 is an abstract quantity at this stage , and while its value is fixed by the measurement of a low - energy process ( muon decay ) , its exact meaning depends on the underlying dynamics which is not yet accessible directly .",
    "the first explanation is generally rejected since it implies that the smallness of the breaking terms ( @xmath9 ) is pure coincidence . for a natural explanation of this ratio@xcite , we not only need to adopt the second scenario , but we also are led to postulate _",
    "dynamical _ symmetry breaking .",
    "such an extremely small number should be the result of solving fundamental dynamical equations _ without _ particularly small parameters .",
    "ultimately , we are looking for a fundamental theory without adjustable parameters at all .",
    "fortunately , we know at least one solution to this problem .",
    "strongly - coupled quantum field theories generate large scale ratios from the quantum effect of renormalization group running@xcite .",
    "they allow the interpretation of the scale hierarchy as an exponential factor @xmath10 within the context of quantum field theory .",
    "qcd - type condensation is the one example where this actually happens in particle physics . neglecting all other interactions for simplicity",
    ", we could solve the renormalization group equation for the running strong coupling constant @xmath11 with a `` natural '' initial condition at the planck scale , say @xmath12 . identifying the qcd scale @xmath13 with the scale where @xmath11 becomes strong at low energies ,",
    "we obtain a scale ratio @xmath14 similar to ( [ exponential ] ) .",
    "the exponent is proportional to the inverse of the initial value of @xmath15 at the high scale .",
    "in the qcd case , the low - energy singularity in the perturbative evolution of the coupling is resolved by the condensation of gluons and of left - handed and right - handed fermions , breaking the chiral symmetry at the scale @xmath16 . incidentally",
    ", this mechanism would also trigger ewsb in the @xmath17 range , if the electroweak symmetry was not already broken at the higher scale @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , dynamical symmetry breaking is the explanation for a wide variety of physical phenomena , from superconductivity to the laser effect .",
    "the overall description is simple . out of the fundamental fields of the model one",
    "constructs scalar field multiplets @xmath19 with nonvanishing quantum numbers under the symmetry in question .",
    "if the effective potential for such a field has a nontrivial solution which is energetically favorable , it will get a vacuum expectation value , breaking the symmetry and allowing for new effective couplings which exact symmetry would forbid .",
    "there is no need for @xmath19 to correspond to independent observable degrees of freedom , since it can be a composite of other fields present in the theory ( such as cooper pairs in bcs superconductivity ) .",
    "thus , while fundamental higgs particles as @xmath19 quanta are not excluded , they are not necessary for the higgs mechanism of ewsb to work .",
    "just as in qcd , one can associate a scale @xmath20 with dynamical symmetry breaking , the _ compositeness scale_.",
    "@xmath20 might be significantly higher than the ewsb scale @xmath7 .",
    "then , in the intermediate scale range @xmath21 the model will reduce to a renormalizable effective theory .",
    "this can only be the case if the scalars which provide the longitudinal @xmath22 and @xmath6 states are accompanied by extra scalar states such that a complete linear representation of @xmath1 is formed .",
    "the extra states can be observed as particles , the higgs bosons ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) .    as will be discussed below , in models without an observable higgs state the compositeness scale can not be higher than@xcite @xmath23 if there is a single higgs boson with mass @xmath24 , the compositeness scale is constrained instead by @xmath25 the location of the landau pole of the higgs self - coupling .",
    "the relation ( [ lambda - prime ] ) implies that the concept of a higgs boson makes sense only if @xmath26 , such that @xmath27@xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 could be large , but dynamical symmetry breaking by itself provides no obvious mechanism for this .",
    "one would rather expect this ratio to be of order one , so the window for composite higgs states is narrow . on the other hand , scalar states",
    "could actually be elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "this is consistent with a dynamical solution of the hierarchy problem only if their masses are protected by a symmetry . in that case , the scalar interactions which trigger ewsb could only be generated indirectly , which shifts dynamical symmetry breaking to a new ( hidden ) sector of the theory .",
    "this is the way supersymmetric models are constructed , which are considered in ref .  .",
    "another possibility which opens some window for composite higgs bosons is the identification of the higgs multiplet with pseudo - goldstone scalars generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking at a higher scale@xcite .",
    "recently , realistic models with this structure have been proposed , the so - called _ little higgs _ models@xcite .",
    "like supersymmetric models , they leave room for the electroweak scale being generated dynamically through strong interactions , but in these scenarios the effective theory is weakly interacting up to energies significantly beyond the @xmath0 scale .",
    "by contrast , in the absence of light higgs multiplets no weakly interacting effective theory can be constructed that is valid up to that energy range . instead",
    ", the strong interactions which accompany dynamical scale generation may be directly coupled to standard model particles and show up in scattering processes once the available energies are sufficiently close to the new compositeness scale .",
    "therefore , one can not just expect to observe the effects _ associated _ with ewsb at colliders ( e.g. , higgs particles , superpartners , pseudo - goldstone bosons ) , but there is hope to get a handle on those ( strongly - interacting ) new degrees of freedom which are _ responsible _ for ewsb .      within the context of four - dimensional field theory , dynamical symmetry breaking must be assigned to new gauge interactions .",
    "this is a common feature of all dynamical models of ewsb@xcite .",
    "the models differ in the role of fermions :    1 .",
    "since , as in qcd , fermions which feel strong gauge interactions are confined , it is likely that the fermions ( _ technifermions _ ) directly associated with ewsb are unobservable at low energies .",
    "this is the original _ technicolor _ ( tc ) idea@xcite .",
    "technifermion condensation is able to account for effective scalar states which provide the longitudinal components of @xmath22 and @xmath6 bosons .",
    "2 .   pure tc will not generate any left - right couplings for the observable fermions , just as qcd generates constituent masses for quarks , but not for leptons",
    ". however , such couplings could be due to additional dynamically broken gauge interactions at even higher energies which are felt both by ordinary and by technifermions .",
    "this mechanism is known as _ extended technicolor _",
    "( etc)@xcite . below the etc scale ,",
    "such interactions lead to four - fermion couplings .",
    "when technifermions condense at the compositeness scale , the desired bilinear couplings are generated .",
    "3 .   exchanging the roles of tc and etc , a dynamically broken gauge interaction might trigger ewsb by fermion condensation not too far above the electroweak scale . in that case , the affected fermions need not be confined .",
    "the heavy top quark is the prime candidate ( _ topcolor _ ) for such a strongly - interacting object@xcite .",
    "since for this mechanism to actually work the top quark is somewhat too light , more recent models that follow this pattern implement a combined _ topcolor - assisted technicolor _",
    "other models of this type involve the condensation of neutrinos , which might have large yukawa couplings despite their tiny physical masses and thus could feel new strong interactions@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the physical top mass could be suppressed by a two - state mixing effect ( _ top see - saw_)@xcite . in such models ,",
    "the electroweak scale @xmath7 is typically suppressed compared to the compositeness scale @xmath20 , and there is room for composite higgs bosons in the intermediate range .    the complicated pattern of flavor physics stands as the main obstacle for constructing a simple theory of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "it is difficult to simultaneously accomodate ( i ) very light leptons and quarks , ( ii ) a heavy top quark , ( iii ) the smallness of flavor - changing neutral currents@xcite . turning the argument around",
    ", the fact that fermion mass generation can not be separated from electroweak physics in strongly - interacting models , opens the possibility that some of the puzzles of flavor physics are resolved at future collider experiments .",
    "while it is clearly worthwhile to search for signals of specific models in collider experiments , the limited energy range of a next - generation linear collider may not allow to access new states associated with the higgs sector directly .",
    "in such a situation , a model - independent treatment of the dynamics is more appropriate .",
    "fortunately , the formalism of effective ( or phenomenological ) lagrangians@xcite provides a generic framework for the bottom - up description of electroweak interactions in the absence of a complete renormalizable field theory .    at energies much below the @xmath22 and @xmath6 ( and higgs ) masses , the dominant interactions of leptons and quarks are qed and qcd interactions , governed by an effective lagrangian of operator dimension four and less : @xmath29    for simplicity , we ignore qcd interactions here .",
    "the building blocks consist , first of all , of left- and right - handed quark and lepton fields , @xmath30 we omit generation and color indices , so all coupling constants should be understood as matrices . while gauge couplings are diagonal by definition , the bilinear quark and lepton couplings",

    "@xmath239 + ( 45,25 ) + this class of processes has a cross section that rises logarithmically with energy , so increasing the energy as well as the luminosity will improve the experimental sensitivity . in the asymptotic limit where masses can be neglected ,",
