    "if accretion disks radiate dissipated energy more quickly than their material moves inward , simple energy conservation determines their effective temperature as a function of radius @xmath2 : it is @xmath3^{1/4 } , \\label{eq : teff}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , the central mass is @xmath5 , the accretion rate is @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a correction factor ( close to unity at large radius ) that accounts for the effect of the net angular momentum flux through the disk and relativistic corrections . inside the disk ,",
    "the temperature is often supposed to increase @xmath8 ( for optical depth from the surface @xmath9 ) , in keeping with conventional local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) stellar atmosphere theory ( e.g. , as in shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this guess about the internal temperature gradient is founded , however , upon the tacit assumption that the outgoing flux is created mostly near the midplane , which may or may not be true in real disks . unfortunately , despite all the effort that has been expended upon accretion disk dynamics , there has been as yet only very limited attention given to their thermal structure @xcite    the true temperature profile matters in a number of ways .",
    "it is , of course , the fundamental parameter governing vertical hydrostatic balance , whether the pressure is dominated by gas or radiation .",
    "thus , the disk s thickness depends upon it .",
    "in addition , for known effective temperature ( see equation 1 ) , the spectrum emergent from any particular ring depends most strongly on the gravity at the photosphere . in thin disks ,",
    "the vertical component of gravity increases linearly with height , so the temperature profile governs this quantity as well .",
    "whether conventional plane - parallel , time - steady stellar atmosphere theory even applies to accretion disks also depends on whether the temperature ( and density ) structure is sufficiently homogeneous and stationary , one more open question .",
    "still another aspect of accretion disks for which knowledge of the vertical temperature profile is vital is the origin of hard x - ray emission . a very - nearly ubiquitous property of accretion disks around black holes , it appears on phenomenological grounds to find its origin in a  coronal \" region somewhere near the disk surface .",
    "it is widely assumed that somehow the vertical temperature profile must accommodate a sharp upward rise above the photosphere , as the highest @xmath10 even in disks around relatively low - mass black holes ( @xmath11 is merely @xmath12  k , whereas the observed hard x - rays demand @xmath13  k.    with the recognition that accretion is due to magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence driven by an underlying magneto - rotational instability , the path toward answering these questions has been laid out , at least in principle : track the dissipation that must occur at the short lengthscale end of the turbulent cascade ; use known radiation physics to relate heat injection to photon production ; compute photon transfer to the surface .",
    "the result of following this program will be a complete description of the disk equation of state and thermodynamics .",
    "it is the object of this paper to report a step toward carrying out this project .",
    "as we will describe at greater length in the body of the paper , we have simulated a shearing - box section of a gas - dominated accretion disk in a manner that captures all numerically - dissipated energy .",
    "we suppose that this energy is transformed into local heating , and then solve the radiation transfer problem in the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation . with this method , we are able to find the internal profiles of dissipation rate and temperature , as well as gas density and other interesting physical quantities .",
    "we are also able to study the character of fluctuations , both spatial and temporal .",
    "of all the many previous numerical studies of accretion disk properties that have been done to explore the consequences of mri - driven mhd turbulence , the work by is the one that most closely approached these questions before the present effort . in that paper",
    ", they explored the vertical structure of mhd turbulence within a shearing - box , but did so making a simplifying assumption about the gas thermodynamics : that the equation of state was isothermal .",
    "we will use their results as a standard of comparison in order to clarify which of our findings depend on explicit calculation of the gas s thermodynamics , and which may be found on the basis of simpler arguments .",
    "the subject of our simulation is a radially thin slice of a gas - dominated accretion disk .",
    "we approximate the dynamics of this slice by a shearing box .",
    "that is , if we denote the radial coordinate by @xmath14 , the azimuthal coordinate by @xmath15 , and the vertical coordinate by @xmath16 , we assume there are underlying ( unsimulated ) dynamics that produce an azimuthal velocity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the orbital frequency and the zero - point of @xmath14 is in the center of the box .",
    "because this shearing - box is meant to approximate a section of an orbiting disk , we also assume a coriolis force and appropriate gravitational tidal forces .",
    "the equations we solve to describe the dynamics of this box are the frequency - averaged equations of radiation mhd in the fld approximation : @xmath19 the quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the density , internal energy , and velocity field of the gas .",
    "the pressure of the gas @xmath23 is related to the internal energy by @xmath24 with the adiabatic index @xmath25 ( here @xmath26 is assumed ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the stress associated with a small artificial bulk viscosity employed , in the usual manner , to suppress post - shock ringing by capturing the shock s entropy generation .",
    "@xmath28 represents the rate at which the internal energy must be changed in order for total energy to be conserved ( see appendix [ app : cnsv ] ) .",
    "@xmath29 is the magnetic field , @xmath30 is the current density , and @xmath31 is the electric field .",
    "the radiation field is described by the energy density @xmath32 , flux @xmath33 , and pressure tensor @xmath34 .",
    "the equations are closed with the relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the eddington tensor , which is defined in terms of the scalar eddington factor @xmath37 : @xmath38 the eddington factor is in turn assumed to depend on the flux limiter @xmath39 and the dimensionless opacity parameter @xmath40 through the relation , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "assuming lte , the radiation emission rate is simply the planck function , @xmath43 . appropriately averaging the frequency - dependent free - free opacity , the planck - mean opacity @xmath44 depends on the other parameters as",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 g@xmath47 ( one of the reasons we choose a comparatively small central mass , @xmath48 , for this simulation is to reduce the contribution of other mechanisms to the absorptive opacity ) .",
    "both free - free absorption and thomson scattering are included in the rosseland - mean opacity @xmath49 ( @xmath50 @xmath46 g@xmath47 ) .    for the problem studied in this paper , the thermodynamics and vertical structure of a gas pressure - dominated disk , the radiation force term in equation  [ eq : mom ] might seem superfluous .",
    "we retain it for two reasons .",
    "first , although in the conditions treated here the radiation force is relatively small , it still contributes at the tens of percent level .",
    "second , one of our long - term goals in this effort is to study disks in which radiation forces are more important , so we wish to develop techniques capable of describing them .",
    "it is also worth commenting that there are some problems in which the gas s radiative losses could be treated more simply .",
    "if , for example , the ion temperature is elevated far above the electron temperature , the density in the disk can be so low that the optically thin limit can apply .",
    "the tool we use to solve these equations is the latest version of the radiation / mhd code first described in , and then successively modified by , @xcite and again by @xcite .",
    "we have further improved it .",
    "the most important change in terms of its applicability to this scientific problem is that it now conserves energy quite accurately by means of a special internal energy update scheme designed to ensure that all numerical losses of kinetic and magnetic energy are captured in the form of heat added to the gas internal energy ( details in appendix [ app : cnsv ] ) . in this way",
    ", these equations mimic the much more complex physics of magnetic reconnection and other kinetic processes .    in addition",
    ", we have also made several technical improvements .",
    "two are worth noting here .",
    "first , instead of the alternating direction implicit ( adi ) method used by to solve the radiation diffusion equation , we now employ the gauss - seidel method accelerated by a full multi - grid method . when the adi method was used with a shearing box boundary condition , maintaining stability restricted the time step @xmath51 to be shorter than the diffusion time step .",
    "our code is free from this restriction because the gauss - seidel method solves the diffusion equation in a directionally unsplit way .",
    "the courant number for the radiation diffusion can be as large as @xmath52 in our simulation .",
    "second , in every grid - based hydrodynamics simulation with explicit time - advance , the courant condition puts an upper limit on the time - step that can be used . in this case",
    ", we evaluate this limit in terms of the time for an acoustic wave supported by gas , magnetic , and radiation pressure to cross a grid - zone .",
    "this time is much shorter in the low - density regions above the photosphere than in the midplane because the ratio of radiation pressure to density is very large there .",
    "consequently , the time - step is governed primarily by the lowest - density zones .",
    "if the density there were permitted to be as small as the dynamics demanded , a prohibitive number of time - steps would be required in order to complete the simulation . in the closely - related work of @xcite , a lower bound of @xmath53 of the maximum density in the initial state",
    "was placed on the density in order to prevent such a computational slow - down .",
    "however , invocation of the density floor effectively means injection of energy into the problem because the newly - created mass is given the local velocity and implicitly acquires the local potential energy .",
    "to enhance the quality of our energy conservation while still limiting the total computing time required to a reasonable amount , we set this floor at @xmath54 of the midplane density . at this value ,",
    "the total amount of energy injected due to the density floor is @xmath55 of the total heat dissipation over the 60 orbits of the simulation .",
    "further details about this procedure ( and the smaller effects of some other variable caps ) may be found in appendix  [ app : arti ] .",
    "the physical conditions in such a slice are determined by three parameters : the central black hole mass @xmath5 , the central radius of the slice @xmath2 , and the surface density @xmath56 .",
    "the values we have chosen for them are meant to be representative of conditions in an accretion disk around a galactic black - hole binary relatively far from the black hole itself : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the surface density predicted by an @xmath59 shakura - sunyaev disk model with an accretion rate @xmath6 that would yield a total luminosity of @xmath60 if the radiative efficiency in rest - mass units were 0.1 .",
    "the effective temperature at the surface of such a disk segment is @xmath61  k. these parameters can be combined to define a characteristic scale - height @xmath62 after estimating the temperature rise toward the center of the disk . in such a model , the relation between surface density and accretion rate is @xmath63 the symbols @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath4 in this expression are the mean mass per particle , the boltzmann constant , and the stefan - boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "numerical values for these and a number of other parameters of interest are collected in table [ tab : param ] ( note that in the shearing - box approximation , @xmath66 ) .",
    "cccl @xmath5 & @xmath67 & @xmath68  g & mass of central black hole + @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71  g  s@xmath47 & estimated mass accretion rate + @xmath72 & & @xmath73 & estimated stress / pressure ratio + @xmath2 & @xmath74 & @xmath75  cm & radius + @xmath18 & @xmath76 & @xmath77  s@xmath47 & orbital frequency + @xmath78&@xmath79 & @xmath80  s & orbital period + @xmath62 & @xmath81 & @xmath82  cm & disk scale - height + @xmath83 & @xmath84 & @xmath85  erg  @xmath86  s@xmath47 & estimated radiation flux at surface + @xmath87 & eq.[[eq : sigma ] ] & @xmath88  g  @xmath86 & surface density + @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91  g  @xmath92 & mean density +      our initial condition is ( almost ) the shakura - sunyaev equilibrium corresponding to our chosen parameters . in this equilibrium , the gas and the radiation are assumed to be in a planar hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium state everywhere below the photosphere .",
    "our initial condition differs from the shakura - sunyaev assumptions in taking the local dissipation rate proportional to the logarithm of the column density to the surface , a dissipation profile adopted on the basis of some previous numerical experiments . under these assumptions , the basic equations ( [ eq : mom ] ) , ( [ eq : erad])+([eq : eint ] ) , and ( [ eq : flux ] )",
    "are reduced to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the total optical depth and we assume the opacity is entirely thomson scattering .",
    "the boundary condition on this set of equations is that the radiative flux at the photosphere ( @xmath95 ) of the disk must match the total dissipation rate ( eq.[[eq : teff ] ] ) , or @xmath83 .",
    "lastly , the gas is also assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the radiation ( @xmath96 ) .    outside the photosphere , the flux is constant ( @xmath97 ) , the gas density is set to the density floor ( see   [ sec : basiceq ] ) , and its temperature is constant at the effective temperature ,",
    "@xmath98  k. because its total pressure is then very nearly constant with height , this gas has almost no support against gravity .",
    "the shapes of the initial gas density and pressure profiles are displayed in figures  [ fig : densprofile ] and [ fig : pressprofile ] .",
    "as expected , the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure in the midplane is small , @xmath99 in the initial state , placing this equilibrium well within the gas - dominated regime .",
    "with such a large surface density , the disk is also very optically thick : its ( half)-thomson depth is @xmath100 .",
    "although the absorptive opacity is never more than @xmath101 of the rosseland mean , the effective optical depth to the midplane is also so large ( @xmath102 ) that we expect the radiation to be well - coupled thermally to the gas except on very short lengthscales and at very high altitude .",
    "this expectation is strongly vindicated in the simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature ] ) .",
    "the initial configuration of the magnetic field is a twisted azimuthal flux tube of circular cross section with radius @xmath103 whose center is placed at @xmath104 .",
    "the field strength in the tube is uniform at @xmath105  g , and its maximum poloidal part is @xmath106  g , corresponding to an initial plasma @xmath107 .",
    "the corresponding maximum mri wavelength in the midplane is @xmath108 cm , which is resolved with @xmath109 grid zones .",
    "the calculation is begun with a small random perturbation in the poloidal velocity .",
    "the maximum amplitude of each velocity component is @xmath110% of the local magnetosonic speed @xmath111 , in which we include radiation in the total pressure .",
    "the computational domain extends @xmath112 along the radial direction , @xmath113 along the orbit , and @xmath113 on either side of the midplane .",
    "it is divided into @xmath114 cells ( @xmath115 ) with constant grid size @xmath116 .",
    "the grid is staggered , with scalar quantities ( @xmath21 , @xmath32 , and @xmath20 ) defined at zone - centers and vector quantities ( @xmath22 , @xmath29 , and @xmath33 ) defined on zone - surfaces .",
    "the azimuthal boundaries are periodic and the radial boundaries are shearing - periodic in the local shearing - box approximation .",
    "we desire the vertical boundaries to be outflow ( free ) boundaries ; that is , we endeavor to determine the values in the ghost cells so that mass , momentum and energy fluxes across the boundaries are the same as those across the adjacent cell surfaces .",
    "however , the vertical disk structure is approximately hydrostatic , so motions across the top and bottom boundaries are in general subsonic .",
    "imperfections in the boundary conditions can therefore act as noise sources for perturbations able to travel into the problem area .",
    "we found in practise that many natural realizations of outflow boundary conditions for this problem suppressed noise - generation sufficiently well that little was seen for tens of orbits , but dramatically elevated values of one or more of the code variables would then suddenly appear in a small number of cells and disrupt the simulation .",
    "the particular version of outflow boundary conditions we present in the next few paragraphs was able to suppress such artifacts for the entire 60 orbit span of this simulation .    for solving advection equations ( steps 4 to 7 in appendix [ app : cnsv ] ) , the usual approach  a constant ( zero slope ) projection of variables into the ghost cells",
    " works well . for solving the radiation diffusion equation ( step 3 in appendix [ app : cnsv ] ) ,",
    "it is better to set @xmath32 in the ghost cells so that the diffusion flux @xmath117 is constant ( details are described in appendix [ app : ebndc ] ) .",
    "we tried both time - explicit and time - implicit versions of this method and found that ( somewhat surprisingly ) the explicit version was less likely to cause problems . to prevent energy inflows ,",
    "we adopt two additional conditions : ( a ) the @xmath16-component of the velocity at the boundary surface is set to zero when it is negative ( positive ) at the top ( bottom ) boundary ( see appendix [ app : arti ] ) .",
    "( b ) the radiation energy in the ghost cell is set equal to that in the adjacent cell when the former becomes larger than the latter .    for the magnetic field",
    ", we build upon the usual scheme in which the electric field is extrapolated into the ghost cells and the induction equation ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : indc ] ) is solved in those cells to find the magnetic field .",
    "this approach ensures that @xmath118 even in the ghost cells ( the ct algorithm ensures it is zero in the entire problem area ) .",
    "it does not , however , guarantee that the magnetic field varies smoothly across the boundaries . to forestall jumps in the magnetic field intensity across the boundary , we introduce a small but finite resistivity into the ghost cells .",
    "this device also prevents the development of field - strength discontinuities at the boundary large enough to cause code crashes .",
    "after some experimentation , we found that these goals could be achieved with a ghost - cell resistivity set to @xmath119 .",
    "note that our electric field extrapolation does not restrict the sign of the poynting flux across the boundary ( see section [ sec : ecnsv ] ) .",
    "the simulation ran for 60 orbits .",
    "transients persisted for 510 orbits , and thereafter most properties maintained a statistically steady state .",
    "for example , during the period from 10 to 60 orbits , the outgoing flux varied within a total range of a factor of two , with an rms fractional variation of only 14% .",
    "we therefore regard the structure as having achieved a well - defined steady - state , and we begin by describing its time - average properties . in the following ,",
    "the time average is done for 50 orbits , from @xmath120 orbits to @xmath121 orbits .",
    "our initial condition is ( almost ) a conventional model for a gas pressure - dominated disk : a ( nearly- ) gaussian profile of gas density with characteristic scale @xmath62 .",
    "however , the time - averaged density profile is considerably shallower in slope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densprofile ] ) . from a height",
    "@xmath122 out to @xmath123 , it is better described by an exponential with a slowly changing length - scale : the density scale - height is @xmath124 for @xmath125 and stretches to @xmath126 at greater altitude .",
    "this result echoes what was found by miller & stone ( 2000 ) , but is different in detail : we find a broader region of slowly - declining density near the midplane ( presumably do to our higher temperature there ) and slightly steeper exponential decline outside that region .    because the density falls relatively gradually with height , the mean altitude of the photosphere ( defined as the point where the eddington factor @xmath127 : see   [ sect : cooling ] for a more detailed discussion ) is almost at the top of the box , @xmath128 .",
    "thus , although most of the mass is contained within @xmath129 of the midplane , in other respects the disk should be thought of as considerably thicker .",
    "clearly , something other than thermal gas pressure must support this extended atmosphere . what that is is revealed in figure  [ fig : pressprofile ] , where we display the profiles of gas pressure ( @xmath130 ) , magnetic pressure ( @xmath131 ) , and radiation pressure ( @xmath132 ) , as well as the contribution of each of them to support against gravity .",
    "although both the radiation pressure and the magnetic pressure are small compared to the gas pressure throughout the initial condition , both become greater than the gas pressure above @xmath1 in the equilibrium , with the magnetic pressure generally a few times greater than the radiation pressure .",
    "deep inside the disk , hydrostatic support is mostly due to gas pressure .",
    "although at higher altitudes the radiation pressure is comparable to the magnetic pressure , and both are larger than the gas pressure , the dominant vertical force is magnetic .",
    "the reason is that near the photosphere , where the radiation pressure is relatively large , its gradient is small .",
    "thus , we find that the disk possesses an extended sub - photospheric magnetically - dominated atmosphere whose thickness is more than twice that of the gas pressure - supported disk body .",
    "although the magnetic field dominates at higher altitudes , the radiation pressure grows to exceed the magnetic field energy density near the midplane . from its initial midplane ratio of @xmath133",
    ", @xmath134 grows to @xmath135 in the steady state , about a factor of 6 greater than @xmath136 at that location .",
    "similarly , the plasma @xmath137 ( which was 24 in the midplane initially ) grows to @xmath138 there , but declines steeply with height , reaching a low of about 0.03 at @xmath139 .",
    "if the pressure used in the plasma @xmath137 is redefined as the sum of radiation plus gas pressure , the minimum @xmath137 is @xmath140 .",
    "these values are very similar to those previously found by , a midplane @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the gas temperature declines from a peak of about @xmath143  k at the midplane to a minimum @xmath144  k , achieved in the range @xmath145 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature ] ) . within @xmath146 of the midplane",
    ", lte is an excellent approximation , as the gas and radiation temperatures are very close . in the outer most of that zone",
    ", the @xmath147 approximation is fairly close to the actual temperature , but it overestimates the temperature by @xmath148 within @xmath149 of the midplane .",
    "this overestimate is due to the finite vertical spread in the dissipation distribution ( see section [ sect : dissipation ] ) . at large @xmath150 ,",
    "the radiation temperature approaches the effective temperature ( as it must ) .",
    "the time - averaged effective temperature is @xmath151  k , about 10% higher than the temperature predicted by the shakura - sunyaev model .",
    "however , the gas temperature between @xmath146 and @xmath152 exceeds the radiation temperature by about 30% .",
    "above @xmath0 , the gas temperature rises toward our outer boundary .",
    "it is hard for us to determine how much of that rise is physical , and how much is due to the guesses required to impose an outer boundary on the magnetic field .",
    "we are led to suspect that much of it is a numerical artifact because roughness in the magnetic field near the boundary creates a spike in the time - averaged vertical profile of the dissipation density per unit mass , likely leading to this abrupt rise in temperature . however , as figure  [ fig : temperature ] also shows , the radiation temperature decouples from the gas temperature near the gas temperature minimum , so that the outgoing radiation flux is hardly affected by the gas temperature spike near the boundary .",
    "lastly , we turn to the time - averaged stress . even after both horizontal- and time - averaging",
    ", the stress profile still shows small - scale fluctuations and a distinct asymmetry  the peak is at @xmath153 , and is about 50% higher than the level at @xmath154 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipation ] ) .",
    "in fact , we find that at any given time the magnetic field intensity and stress tend to be asymmetric about the midplane , with both a few times greater in one half than in the other .",
    "these asymmetries last for periods @xmath155  orbits before flipping to the other direction .    like many other quantities",
    ", there is also a sharp contrast between the stress in the disk body region ( @xmath156 ) and in the corona . within the disk body region ,",
    "the stress distribution is roughly independent of @xmath16 , but outside that region , it declines sharply .",
    "virtually all the stress is created in the disk body , with only about 10% above @xmath157 and just 1% more than @xmath158 from the plane .",
    "this pattern is qualitatively similar to the results of , who also found an approximately flat - topped stress distribution that extended a few scale - heights from the midplane ; the only contrast is that in their work the drop toward the outside was not as steep",
    ".    averaged over the length of the simulation , the total stress in the problem area was large enough to drive an accretion rate of @xmath159  g  s@xmath47 , 44% greater than our initially estimated accretion rate .",
    "this is why @xmath10 is 10% higher than as predicted by the shakura - sunyaev model , of course . phrased in terms of the traditional @xmath72 measure ( ratio of vertically - integrated stress to vertically - integrated total pressure ) , we find @xmath160 ( note that the time - averaged vertically - integrated pressure is greater than in the initial condition ) . in evaluating this finding , it should be borne in mind that global disk simulations generally find rather larger mean @xmath72 measures than shearing - box simulations like this one .",
    "in addition , we find that this stress is very non - uniformly distributed .",
    "measuring it in pressure units , it rises from @xmath161 in the midplane to @xmath162 at @xmath163 .",
    "the history of energy flows into and out of the shearing box is displayed in figure  [ fig : energycons ] .",
    "the only physical source of energy for the problem volume is the work done on the inner and outer radial surfaces by magnetic and reynolds stresses ( about 77% magnetic ) , but there is also a small non - physical injection of energy whenever the density floor , energy floor , and/or velocity cap is invoked ( see appendix [ app : arti ] ) .",
    "energy loss in the simulation is entirely physical , and may occur through any of three channels : radiation , matter , and poynting flux .",
    "of these , radiation diffusion flux completely dominates the others : the time - averaged fraction in each flux at the outer boundaries is 99.71% ( radiation  diffusion ) , 0.14% ( radiation  advection ) , 0.25% ( matter ) , -0.10% ( poynting flux : it can be negative because we do not prohibit it in the boundary conditions ; see section [ sec : bndc ] . )",
    "given the complete dominance of radiation as the energy output channel , it should not be surprising that its history tracks very closely the history of work done on the box .",
    "the flux can not precisely follow the work , however , because it takes a finite time ( @xmath164 orbit ) for work to be transformed into heat and because it takes more time ( in this case up to @xmath155 orbits ) for the photons to diffuse out .",
    "lightcurve \" is therefore a delayed and smoothed version of the work ( see the following subsection ) .    although the vertical radiation flux is always much larger than either the poynting flux or the energy flux carried by gas motions , the ratios between the fluxes of these three channels change systematically with height ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxprofiles ] ) . in the inner half of the disk ( i.e. , @xmath156@xmath158 ) ,",
    "poynting flux is present at an interesting but low level@xmath1658% of the radiation flux ; at greater height , the poynting flux becomes much weaker . by the time the edge is reached",
    ", the poynting flux is so small that numerical uncertainties in the boundary conditions lead to its time - average turning weakly negative , that is , in net it brings energy into the box .",
    "matter outflow never contributes significantly .",
    "there is also a striking asymmetry in the magnitude of the flux between the two sides of the disk ; this will be discussed further in   [ sec : asymm ] .",
    "these results stand in some contrast to the earlier work on stratified disks by , where the poynting flux through the @xmath166 surface in their fiducial ( toroidal field ) simulation was several times greater , about 25% of the rate at which stresses did work on the walls of the box . in that simulation",
    "there were also ",
    "implicit radiation losses \" associated with their isothermal equation of state .    that the poynting flux should always be rather smaller than the total dissipation rate follows from the character of hydrostatic equilibrium in disks .",
    "the poynting flux may be thought of as arising from magnetic buoyancy , and so can be expected to have a magnitude @xmath167 , where the factor @xmath37 represents the departure from hydrostatic balance that permits the upward motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the total dissipation rate is @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is a profile function that rises from zero in the midplane to unity once all the dissipation has been accomplished , at @xmath170 ( as shown in the following subsection , @xmath171 here ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath172 labels the mean stress in the central body of the disk .",
    "thus , the poynting flux fraction is @xmath173 because the scale - height @xmath174 . in the central disk ,",
    "the ratio of the magnetic field intensity to the stress is typically a few , making the poynting flux fraction somewhat less than @xmath175 ; at larger altitude , the ratio of the local magnetic field energy density to the stress in the central disk drops , and the poynting flux becomes progressively less important .",
    "thus , the maximum poynting contribution is @xmath176 . in this simulation ,",
    "we find that the mean rise speed of magnetic structures ( as seen , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : magspacetime ] ) is @xmath177 , indicating a maximum poynting contribution @xmath178 .",
    "it is possible that in other , less settled , circumstances @xmath37 , and therefore the poynting flux contribution , might be greater .",
    "the energy brought into the problem volume by stresses on the radial surfaces is transformed into magnetic field energy and the kinetic energy of random fluid motions . as the turbulent cascade transfers this energy to smaller and smaller scales ,",
    "eventually it is dissipated .",
    "a small part of this dissipation is associated with weak shocks ( mostly at high altitude ) , but the great majority occurs on the grid - scale and is captured by our local energy conservation scheme , where it is transferred to gas internal energy . because the step in our energy conservation scheme that captures magnetic energy dissipation also includes kinetic energy , we can not fully separate which contributes how much to the total .",
    "what we can say is that in rough terms , 70% of the dissipation comes from the step that mixes the two , 20% is clearly associated with the loss of fluid kinetic energy , and 10% comes from our use of an artificial bulk viscosity . as we will shortly demonstrate , however , there is a strong correlation between dissipation rate and current density ; this correlation suggests that much of the mixed - source 70% is due to magnetic energy .",
    "two global measures of this dissipation are shown in figures  [ fig : dissipation ] and [ fig : disshist ] , its time- and horizontally - averaged vertical profile and its time - history .",
    "the total dissipation rate varies by factors of several over time , but in the mean must result in an effective temperature at the surface as given by equation ( 1 ) . as can be seen in the figure , its fluctuations follow very closely upon fluctuations in the total stress .",
    "cross - correlating the two curves demonstrates that there is generally a lag of less than an orbit between stress and dissipation ; that is , it takes no more than an orbit or so for energy injected by shear stresses at the boundary to traverse the turbulent cascade all the way to dissipation .",
    "the mean vertical profile of the dissipation rate is , in rough terms , a  top - hat \" stretching from @xmath179 to @xmath180 .",
    "it is not coincidental that the dissipation rate drops sharply at the same place where magnetic pressure begins to exceed gas pressure .",
    "dissipation is associated with sharp gradients , particularly in the magnetic field , driven by turbulence . at higher altitudes",
    ", the comparative strength of the field keeps its structure smooth and irons out sharp changes . for many of the same reasons , the vertical profile of",
    "the stress is very similar to that of the dissipation .",
    "a different view of the distribution of dissipation is also instructive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disscurrent ] ) .",
    "although low - level dissipation can occur throughout the fluid due to numerical error , strong dissipation tends to be correlated with intense current , i.e. , regions of large @xmath181 .",
    "a more quantitative view of the association between current density and dissipation can be seen in figure  [ fig : currdisscorr ] , where we plot the number of cells @xmath182 having a given dissipation rate @xmath28 and current density @xmath183 at time @xmath184  orbits . at small values of the current density ,",
    "a significant part of the local dissipation rate is due to random numerical errors .",
    "however , even when @xmath183 is relatively small , there is always a bias to positive dissipation . defining the centroid of the distribution by @xmath185",
    ", we see that for the upper factor of 30 in its dynamic range , @xmath186 is well - described by a power - law @xmath187 .",
    "the rate at which the heat content of the box equilibrates can be parameterized by the cooling time . in any accretion flow that radiates efficiently , conservation of angular momentum and energy require that @xmath188 .",
    "one way to evaluate it more quantitatively from the simulation data is to compute the ratio of the total energy content of the box to the energy flux leaving through its top and bottom surfaces . using this approach",
    ", we find a cooling time of 11.4 orbits . in these terms , our simulation ran for a bit more than 5 cooling times , with 4 of them well after the erasure of initial transients .",
    "however , another way to examine the delay between the creation of heat and its loss is to study the cross - correlation between the volume - integrated dissipation and the flux out of the box .",
    "that relationship is displayed in figure  [ fig : coolcrosscorr ] . as this figure shows ,",
    "fluctuations in the flux tend to follow those in the dissipation rate , but not by very much  although there is an asymmetric tail toward positive lags , the cross - correlation falls to zero by + 10 orbits , and its peak occurs in the range 02 orbits .",
    "the reason that the cooling rate tracks the dissipation rate with a lag almost an order of magnitude shorter than the nominal cooling time is that the variance in the dissipation rate is dominated by the region @xmath189 , where the cooling time is 10 to 30 times shorter than from the midplane . much of the dissipation fluctuation power is on timescales @xmath190 , but because the fluctuations take place in a region of quick cooling , there is nonetheless little time - lag in imprinting them on the radiation flux .",
    "one of the goals of this effort was to compute the structure of the disk all the way from the midplane out through the photosphere so that we could truly say we were describing the entire flow of radiation energy through the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : photosphere ] shows the extent to which we succeeded in reaching this goal . in its left - hand panel , we show a snapshot of the eddington factor @xmath37 as a function of position in the @xmath191 and @xmath192 planes . deep within the optically - thick disk ,",
    "the photon intensity is isotropic and @xmath193 ; far above the photosphere , the photons become nearly mono - directional and @xmath194 .",
    "we choose to define the photospheric level as the place at which @xmath195 . by this standard",
    ", we see that the photospheric surface at any given time is highly irregular",
    ". its height above the midplane can be anywhere from @xmath196 to outside @xmath197 .",
    "in fact , there are places where , as a function of @xmath16 , the photon distribution appears to pass back and forth with increasing altitude from nearly free - streaming to more nearly diffusive .",
    "the snapshot shows roughness in the photospheric surface at a fixed time .",
    "some of the fluctuations are correlated in time , so that the horizontal mean level of the photosphere also moves up and down over time ( as portrayed in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : photosphere ] ) . in this horizontally - averaged sense",
    ", the photosphere generally varies between @xmath198 and @xmath113 from the midplane , but there are occasional excursions both to slightly lower and somewhat greater altitude .",
    "the duration of these fluctuations can vary from a small fraction of an orbit to 12 orbits .",
    "we caution , however , that our method of photosphere determination somewhat overestimates its height from the midplane during times when the density in the outer portion of the box is consistently at the floor .",
    "examples of such times can be identified in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : photosphere ] as those periods during which the nominal photospheric altitude is constant at @xmath196 .",
    "the fact that the density floor is always the same accounts for the constancy of the estimated photospheric height during these periods .",
    "mhd turbulence is , of course , at the heart of the dynamics in this system . as a result ,",
    "fluctuations are central .",
    "we find that the character of these fluctuations is a strong function of altitude from the midplane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flucts ] ) .",
    "because virtually every quantity has a strong systematic dependence on @xmath150 , we define all fluctuations as relative to the mean at a given height .",
    "the gas is almost incompressible near the midplane , but the amplitude of density fluctuations grows rapidly up to @xmath199 , and declines even more sharply out to the top of the box . near @xmath199 , the rms fractional fluctuation can be anywhere from @xmath1624 ( at the time shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flucts ] it is @xmath200 ) .",
    "by contrast , the magnetic field strength behaves in exactly complementary fashion : with the exception of some likely spurious fluctuations associated with the boundaries , it fluctuates the most in the densest part of the disk , @xmath201 .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the varying value of the plasma @xmath137 defined in terms of the sum of gas and radiation pressure .",
    "where @xmath137 is large ( near the midplane ) , magnetic effects can not compress the gas ; where it is small ( roughly @xmath202 ) , magnetic forces can be very effective in driving gas compression and rarefaction .",
    "large opacity guarantees such a strong dynamical coupling between gas and radiation that their pressures sum for the purpose of resisting magnetically - driven compression except on very small scales far from the midplane .",
    "velocity fluctuations behave in a manner similar to density fluctuations . in absolute terms ,",
    "the largest random speeds are seen at high altitudes , @xmath203 . in terms of the mach number relative to the magnetosonic speed ( i.e. , @xmath204/\\rho$ ] ) ,",
    "the random motions are @xmath205 over most of the volume , but can sometimes increase to @xmath1642 near one or the other boundary .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to what was seen in the simulations of miller & stone ( 2000 ) .",
    "they found that , measuring mach number relative to the gas sound speed alone , the rms fluid speed rose from @xmath140 in the midplane to @xmath164 near the outer boundaries .",
    "although the actual fluid speeds we see are considerably greater than the gas sound speed , their mach number with respect to the total sound speed is about the same .      in the disk body",
    ", the temperature is generally quite uniform at any given altitude .",
    "however , in the region above @xmath158 , at any given time there is generally a few percent of the volume in which the temperature is elevated by a factor of 5 or so above the mean ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tempflucts ] ) .",
    "strong negative fluctuations are quite rare .",
    "most often these regions of elevated temperature are roughly round , anywhere from @xmath206 to @xmath207 in diameter ( so the larger ones are well - resolved by our grid ) , but occasionally they can be sheet - like .      a different sort of fluctuation may be seen in space - time plots . although in the long - run the top and bottom halves of the disk behave symmetrically , as shown in figure  [ fig : magspacetime ] , the magnetic field can be persistently stronger on one side of the midplane than on the other . because energy dissipation is largely magnetic , during periods of asymmetry in field strength",
    "there is generally a corresponding asymmetry in dissipation rate .",
    "moreover , the fact that much of the dissipation takes place several scale - heights from the midplane means that an asymmetry in dissipation is mirrored in a dissipation in flux . for periods as long as 510 orbits , the radiation flux through the top or bottom surface can be as much as 23 times as much as through the opposite surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : topbotflux ] ) , although through most of the simulation the contrast was smaller , typically @xmath208 20% .",
    "a view of the magnetic field structure in the steady state is shown in figure [ fig : fieldline ] .",
    "the field - lines are predominantly azimuthal throughout the box , but subtle differences can be distinguished as a function of altitude .",
    "near the midplane ( @xmath209 ) , the field - lines are tangled on short scales ( @xmath210 ) , corresponding to the mhd turbulence driven by the mri . at mid - altitudes ( @xmath211 ) , the field - lines are generally fairly smooth . in the high - altitude zone ( @xmath212 ) , the field - lines get disordered again , and the scale of wiggles is larger ( @xmath213 ) compared to that near the midplane .",
    "this is because random fluid motions are powerful enough ( see section [ sec : velocity ] ) to substantially perturb fieldlines .",
    "perhaps the most striking structural feature apparent in this simulation is the @xmath214 region , where most of the support against gravity is from magnetic pressure . on the basis of its low plasma @xmath137",
    ", it might be described as a corona , but it is a very unusual corona in that it lies well below the photosphere . because of this magnetic support , the top surface of the disk ( if  top \" is defined as the photosphere ) , is considerably higher above the midplane than where the disk surface is conventionally estimated to be .",
    "an isothermal gaussian model , for example , places the photosphere at merely @xmath215 , rather than @xmath216 as we find .",
    "although a similarly magnetically - supported region existed in the simulations , it went unremarked because they did not evaluate the optical depth .",
    "the nature of this region also contradicts another frequently - held view : that magnetically - dominated layers at high altitude should be the site of intense heating , so intense that the temperature can be raised high enough to support hard x - ray emission .",
    "this idea was given indirect support by the finding of substantial vertical poynting flux in the region a few scale - heights from the midplane , although they could not test it directly because they assumed an isothermal equation of state .",
    "we find rather less poynting flux than did they , and little heat dissipation in the magnetically - dominated region .",
    "the absence of dissipation in the  corona \" is most likely a result of the very fact that this zone is magnetically - dominated : the field smooths itself .",
    "we do see a narrow zone of high dissipation rate immediately inside the outer boundaries , and the dissipation there does raise the temperature by about a factor of two , but at least part ( and maybe all ) of this heating near the boundary is likely to be a numerical artifact .",
    "we also observe transient localized regions of very high temperature in this ",
    "corona \" well below the outer boundary , but these are neither hot enough nor common enough to count for much in terms of global properties .",
    "these results raise the question of where the observed hard x - rays are made .",
    "perhaps more promising sites for their production can be found at smaller radii . where radiation pressure dominates gas pressure at all altitudes , the disk s internal vertical profile may be very different .",
    "in addition , as demonstrated in @xcite , there can be extremely high current - density regions at radii comparable to or smaller than the marginally stable orbit and well away from the equatorial plane .",
    "hirose et al .",
    "speculated that these , too , may be loci of hard x - ray production .      in comparison to the commonly - assumed gaussian density profile ,",
    "the extended magnetically - supported atmosphere found in our simulation can be expected to alter the locally - emitted spectrum in significant ways .",
    "specifically , the very steep density gradient at the photosphere predicted by the gaussian model entails a large density there . in the lower density environment",
    "we find near the photosphere , larger departures from lte might be expected , and therefore stronger non - thermal features in the emergent spectrum . a symptom that something of this sort may happen can be seen in the band , a few scale - heights thick , in which the gas temperature rises well above the local radiation temperature .    in the great majority of atmosphere calculations , whether in the context of stars or accretion disks , it is assumed that the photospheric region may be approximated as time - steady and having 1-d slab geometry .",
    "our results regarding both the location of the photosphere and temperature fluctuations in the upper disk call both approximations into question .",
    "however , the nature of radiation transfer may ameliorate both problems . because the photon diffusion time is very short compared to the local dynamical time in the upper atmosphere of the disk",
    ", the radiation can respond very quickly to varying conditions .",
    "the nature of its response is for diffusion to smooth out irregularities ; in fact , there is far less spatial variation in horizontal planes in the radiation intensity than in the gas density or temperature or magnetic field strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flucts ] ) .",
    "in addition , the characteristic temperature fluctuation takes the form of a spot of high temperature , but because the opacity diminishes with increasing temperature , these spots largely decouple from the radiation .    another virtually universal assumption made in previous work on accretion disks",
    "is that their top and bottom surfaces should have equal surface brightness .",
    "yet we find that the magnetic field intensity , and therefore the dissipation rate , and consequently the emergent flux , can be asymmetric with respect to the midplane with a consistent sense of contrast for as long as 510 orbits at a stretch . because we are simulating a shearing - box and not an entire disk , we have no way of knowing how well correlated such asymmetries might be in radius .",
    "if there is significant coherence in these fluctuations over radial extents comparable to the local radius , the luminosity of the disk as measured by any single observer could be wrong by factors of a few .",
    "it is likewise frequently asserted that the radiation from a disk surface can not vary in any substantial way on timescales shorter than a cooling time .",
    "we have found , however , that because so much of the dissipation variation takes place at comparatively high altitude , it is entirely possible for the emergent flux to vary as much as an order of magnitude faster than the global equilibration cooling time .",
    "most properties of accretion disks depend only on quantities such as the accretion rate in eddington units @xmath217 and the radius in gravitational radii from which the mass of the central object has already been scaled out",
    ". however , the temperature is different . for fixed @xmath217 and @xmath218 ,",
    "the temperature is @xmath219 .",
    "the most significant effects that this is likely to have on the properties discussed here all result from the dependence of the opacity on temperature .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , we chose a relatively small central mass ( @xmath220 ) so that sources of opacity other than free - free absorption and thomson opacity would be comparatively unimportant .",
    "however , if the mass were @xmath221 times greater , with @xmath217 and @xmath218 fixed at the values of our simulation ( 0.1 and 300 ) , the surface temperature would fall to @xmath222  k. at this temperature , there would be substantial opacity due to resonance lines in medium-@xmath223 elements .",
    "it is possible that the scattering opacity would then be so large that the vertical radiation force could overcome the vertical component of gravity even at high altitude ( cf . proga & kallman 2004 ) . in this circumstance",
    ", the vertical structure of the disk would undoubtedly be quite different .    in a similar vein , at still higher masses ( @xmath224 , the domain of agns )",
    ", the surface temperature would be @xmath225  k , where ionization transitions can lead to pulsational instabilities .",
    "we have shown that it is now possible to track in some detail the path of energy within accretion disks , from turbulent dissipation to heat to diffusing photons .",
    "when we do so , we find that some conclusions about disk structure drawn on simpler thermodynamic models ( e.g. , isothermal equations of state ) are supported , but not all .",
    "for example , the existence of an extended magnetically - supported atmosphere was already predicted by the isothermal models .",
    "what they could not do , however , because they did not compute optical depths , was to discover that a large part of this magnetically - supported atmosphere can lie below the photosphere .    our model for the dissipation of turbulence will certainly not be the final word on this subject ",
    "we do not have the resolution to capture the full inertial range of mhd turbulence driven by the mri , nor do we compute its genuine microphysics .",
    "however , locating dissipation where the gradients are so sharp as to cause numerical losses of magnetic and kinetic energy is a very plausible supposition . on the basis of this method",
    ", we have found that the time - averaged dissipation profile is roughly flat in terms of rate per unit volume within roughly @xmath226 of the midplane , but drops sharply outside that height , with very little dissipation in the magnetically - supported ( but optically - thick )  corona \" . over timescales that are presumably short compared to the lifetime of the disk , but comparable to or even somewhat greater than the local cooling time , there can be sizable departures from this mean profile , especially in the sense of an asymmetry between the top and bottom halves of the disk .",
    "we have also found that this spread in the dissipation permits significant parts of it to be found in places where the photon diffusion time to the surface is relatively short .",
    "consequently , there can be significant fluctuations in the outgoing flux that track fluctuations in the disk heating rate with a lag that is an order of magnitude shorter than the nominal cooling time .",
    "lastly , the detailed structure we have computed suggests that the emergent spectrum from the gas - dominated portions of accretion disks may deviate significantly from blackbody .",
    "they are likely to have extended atmospheres in which the gas temperature differs from the radiation temperature and the densities are low enough that other breakdowns in the details of lte may occur .",
    "in addition , the photospheric surface itself may have both a complicated topology and interesting fluctuations , leading to additional non - blackbody effects .    we would like to thank neal turner , who contributed so much to the previous version of our simulation code .",
    "this work was partially supported by nsf grants ast-0205806 and ast-0313031 ( sh , jhk ) , and by nsf grant ast-0413788 and princeton university ( jms ) .",
    "the numerical scheme of the zeus code , upon which our code is built , consists of the following seven steps :    1 .",

    "@xcite began this transformation by altering step 7 to be the solution of a total energy equation in the conservative form @xmath234 they then updated the internal energy according to @xmath235 where the asterisk variables denote those updated in the step . in this way ,",
    "any kinetic or magnetic energy that might have been lost numerically during this step is instead captured into internal energy because the total energy @xmath236 is conserved .",
    "we have extended this approach to steps 4 , 5 , and 6 , in order to capture in the same way any kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost . in each of these steps ,",
    "the internal energy equation is replaced by the corresponding total energy equation :    1 .",
    "gas pressure gradient @xmath237 2 .",
    "artificial viscosity @xmath238 3 .",
    "transport step @xmath239    after each of these steps , the internal energy is updated by @xmath240 thus , the kinetic and magnetic energies that in the original zeus code would be lost numerically are completely captured as internal energy during steps 4 to 7 in our scheme .",
    "the net result of all these steps is represented by the symbol @xmath28 in equation  [ eq : eint ] .",
    "we show how it is explicitly computed in appendix  [ app : diss ] .      the dependent variables @xmath21 , @xmath32 , @xmath20 , @xmath29 , and @xmath22 suffice to determine the state of the simulation . however , we are interested in the dissipation as a function of time and position as a fundamental diagnostic of the thermal physics in these disks . because of the way we update the internal energy , to record the dissipation rate requires some special effort .",
    "the total dissipation rate receives contributions in all the steps from 4 through 7 . to compute their individual rates ,",
    "we retain the internal energy equation and solve it in parallel with the total energy equation . at each step",
    ", we must distinguish between the internal energy as it evolves and the internal energy that would have resulted from adiabatic changes alone .",
    "for the purposes of this discussion , we convey this distinction by defining @xmath21 as the internal energy before an update step , @xmath241 as the internal energy after update by the total energy equation , and @xmath242 as the internal energy after an update by the internal energy equation alone .",
    "the artificial viscosity dissipation rate in step 5 can be computed as @xmath243 because the rhs of the internal energy equation in this step is nothing more than this dissipation rate .",
    "on the other hand , the numerical dissipation rate in each of steps 4 through 7 can be evaluated as @xmath244 because the difference @xmath245 corresponds to the numerically - lost kinetic and magnetic energies captured as internal energy .    the total dissipation rate in the simulation",
    "can then be written as the sum of all these rates : @xmath246 note that the artificial viscosity dissipation rate @xmath243 is always positive by definition , whereas a numerical dissipation rate @xmath244 can be negative due to numerical errors .    because our evaluation of the dissipation rate intrinsically involves capturing numerical errors that are likely to depend strongly on the grid - scale relative to the scale of physical gradients",
    ", one might fairly ask whether our results are sensitive to resolution . to answer this question",
    ", we have run a shorter simulation with a grid having twice the resolution in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "the initial condition for this resolution - testing simulation was the state of the main simulation at @xmath247  orbits , and it ran for 1 full orbit . to distinguish the two , we call our primary simulation the  standard \" .    for times",
    "up to a few tenths of an orbit after its start , the distribution of dissipation in the higher - resolution simulation remained very similar to that in the standard one with the exception that peaks in the dissipation were more sharply - defined ( fig .  [ fig : resolutioncheck ] ) .",
    "after a few tenths of an orbit , the chaotic character of the turbulent dynamics leads to a divergence of the detailed structure of the flow as compared to the standard simulation .",
    "nonetheless , the time - history of the volume - integrated dissipation rate in the higher - resolution simulation tracks closely that of the standard for the duration of the test , deviating by only a few percent at most over an orbital period . thus , we conclude that if the magnetic structure is independently fixed in place , our numerical scheme locates the dissipation more or less as well as it can , given the constraints posed by the actual resolution employed . over timescales long enough to move the specific places where dissipation happens",
    ", the fact that the volume - integrated dissipation rate hardly changes in this limited resolution test means that we have no immediate grounds for concern about sensitivity of our results to our resolution scale .",
    "three limiting values must be placed on quantities in order to preserve stability and to keep the time - step from becoming prohibitively small .",
    "these are : a density floor , an energy floor , and a velocity cap .",
    "the density floor and the velocity cap are applied only after step 7 , but the energy floor is applied in each of steps 4 to 7 . here",
    "we describe how they work and evaluate energy injection rates associated with each of them .",
    "\\(a ) density floor : an extremely low density would cause a very short time - step because @xmath51 must be @xmath248 . if the density were to go negative , it could cause the code to halt . to avoid either of these problems , the density @xmath20 is set to the floor value @xmath249 when @xmath250 . for this simulation , we set @xmath249 to @xmath54 times the initial density at the midplane . the energy injection rate due to the density floor is @xmath251",
    "\\(b ) energy floor : the internal energy computed by the total energy equation , @xmath241 , can become extremely small or even negative due to numerical errors . simply applying a floor of small value does not work because it can lead to an unphysically large free - free opacity .",
    "therefore , we employ @xmath242 instead of @xmath241 when @xmath252 ; the fudge factor @xmath253 in this simulation .",
    "the energy injection rate is then @xmath254    \\(c ) velocity cap : two different limits are placed on the velocity : ( 1 ) to avoid inflows through the top and bottom boundaries , the @xmath16-component of the velocity at the top ( bottom ) boundary surfaces is forced to zero when it is negative ( positive ) .",
    "( 2 ) to avoid unusually large speeds due to numerical errors , a cap is applied to the magnitude of each component of the velocity ; the value of the velocity cap is set to @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the full - width of the box in the @xmath14-direction . the energy injection rate due to these corrections is @xmath257 which is always negative by definition .",
    "integrated over the 60 orbits of the simulation , each of these is quite small , but the total amounts of energy injection due to the energy floor and velocity cap are rather smaller than that due to the density floor .",
    "relative to the total dissipated energy , the density floor adds 0.9% , the energy floor subtracts 0.06% , and the velocity cap subtracts 0.05% .      total energy conservation in our system can be written as follows .",
    "@xmath258 integrating equation ( [ eq : totcnsv ] ) over time and volume , we have @xmath259 where @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 are , respectively , volume integrals of @xmath263 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 . to evaluate how well total energy is conserved in our numerical code , we computed a relative error @xmath266 as a function of time , which is shown in figure  [ fig : econserve ] .",
    "we see that the absolute value of the error stays lower than @xmath267 over a span of 60 orbits .",
    "the top and bottom boundary conditions for the radiation diffusion equation ( step 3 in appendix [ app : cnsv ] ) are determined by a requirement that the diffusion flux @xmath268 across the boundary is equal to that across the adjacent cell surface . here the diffusion coefficient @xmath269 .",

    "hereafter we omit the inactive indices @xmath272 and @xmath273 for clarity .",
    "then , we compute the ratio of radiation energy in the ghost cell ( index @xmath274 ) to that in the last real cell ( index @xmath65 ) from the above equation , @xmath275 finally , assuming that the ratio @xmath2 changes slowly over time , we obtain the boundary condition for the radiation energy in the current step , @xmath276 therefore , the requirement holds only approximately in the current step . however , this boundary condition is stable and also easy to implement in the numerical code .",

    "<S> we calculate the vertical structure of a local patch of an accretion disk in which heating by dissipation of mri - driven mhd turbulence is balanced by radiative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> heating , radiative transport , and cooling are computed self - consistently with the structure by solving the equations of radiation mhd in the shearing - box approximation . using a fully 3-d and energy - conserving code </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the structure of this disk segment over a span of more than five cooling times . after a brief relaxation period , a statistically steady - state develops . </S>",
    "<S> measuring height above the midplane in units of the scale - height predicted by a shakura - sunyaev model , we find that the disk atmosphere stretches upward , with the photosphere rising to @xmath0 , in contrast to the @xmath1 predicted by conventional analytic models . </S>",
    "<S> this more extended structure , as well as fluctuations in the height of the photosphere , may lead to departures from planckian form in the emergent spectra . </S>",
    "<S> dissipation is distributed across the region within @xmath1 of the midplane , but is very weak at greater altitudes . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature deep in the disk interior is less than that expected when all heat is generated in the midplane . with only occasional exceptions </S>",
    "<S> , the gas temperature stays very close to the radiation temperature , even above the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> because fluctuations in the dissipation are particularly strong away from the midplane , the emergent radiation flux can track dissipation fluctuations with a lag that is only 0.10.2 times the mean cooling time of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> long timescale asymmetries in the dissipation distribution can also cause significant asymmetry in the flux emerging from the top and bottom surfaces of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> radiative diffusion dominates poynting flux in the vertical energy flow throughout the disk . </S>"
