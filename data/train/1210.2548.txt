    "the crooks relation @xcite states that the outcome of the mechanical processing of a system according to a prescribed sequence of actions is related to the outcome of a process consisting of the reversed sequence .",
    "it is a connection between the probability distributions of the amount of work @xmath0 performed on the system in the course of such forward and backward processes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "a forward process might consist of the movement of a piston to compress a gas in a cylinder , while the backward process would be the opposite movement to expand the gas @xcite .",
    "the validity of the crooks relation requires that the system should start out in canonical equilibrium at the same temperature @xmath1 for both processes .",
    "the system might maintain contact with a heat bath at that temperature during the processing or it could be isolated .",
    "the relation reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the change in free energy of the system associated with the forward process , evaluated for example on the basis of the isothermal change in volume of the expanded gas .",
    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) states that the probability that the forward process should require an input of work @xmath0 , and the probability of requiring work @xmath10 ( in other words receiving work from the system ) during the backward process , are related to each other , but are not in general equal .",
    "the relation has been shown to hold for a variety of choices of dynamics , though studies reveal that it is important to define carefully what is meant by work , particularly for strong coupling between a system and its environment @xcite .",
    "it implies @xcite the jarzynski equality @xmath11 , which in turn leads to @xmath12 for a forward process starting in equilibrium , where the brackets indicate an average taken over the probability distribution of work done .",
    "this , of course , is a statement of the second law of thermodynamics , and the crooks relation , jarzynski equality and the associated fluctuation relations have received a great deal of attention as a result ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "it has proved valuable to study the crooks relation in the context of simple examples @xcite in order to gain insight into its operation in more complex cases , and the 1-d harmonic oscillator has proved to be a popular system .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to calculate work distributions for an isolated oscillator using a geometric and pictorial approach that has , we believe , some intuitive pedagogical value . in doing so ,",
    "we expose a broader symmetry of the distribution of work for such a forward process , which has its origin in the simplicity of the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator , and which demonstrates the rather special character of this system with regard to its fluctuation behaviour .    work is performed by prescribing a time - dependent spring constant @xmath2 during the process .",
    "if the spring constant varies cyclically in an interval @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , then @xmath15 , and moreover if the process takes place under conditions of thermal isolation , then no heat is exchanged during the cycle and @xmath16 , the change in system energy .",
    "the crooks relation reduces to @xmath17 : a result verified , for example , by deffner and lutz @xcite .",
    "but our approach to solving the classical evolution demonstrates that a relation @xmath18 also holds for a class of forward processes , with the parameter @xmath19 depending on the nature of the process , and with @xmath20 taking a specified analytic form .",
    "it is quite compatible with the crooks relation for a cyclic forward process and its backward counterpart , for which @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as we shall show .",
    "we also compare the continuous distribution of work arising from a classical treatment with the discrete distribution of work that emerges from the quantum treatment of a cyclic process to show that these properties are preserved .",
    "fluctuations in the quantum case are broader , as a result of the wider range of possible outcomes made possible by the dynamics .    in the next section we analyse a general work process performed on a classical harmonic oscillator , represented in terms of a matrix operation on a system phasor .",
    "we evaluate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of system energy change for @xmath23 independent oscillators .",
    "we go on to treat the system quantum mechanically in section [ sec : quantum - treatment ] , particularly to contrast the widths of the classical and quantum pdfs for cyclic processes .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "it is convenient to convert the time - dependent spring constant @xmath2 into a time - dependent natural frequency @xmath24 , so that the hamiltonian at time @xmath25 is @xmath26    and the equation of motion is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the momentum and position of the oscillator , and @xmath30 is its mass .",
    "the response of the system may be illustrated using pictures of phase space orbits .",
    "an isolated system with constant frequency @xmath31 performs clockwise circular orbits in a phase space where momentum is normalised by dividing by @xmath32 .",
    "the square of the radius of the orbit is proportional to the initial energy of the oscillator .",
    "if the spring constant is changed at time @xmath33 , altering @xmath34 and the energy , then the system moves onto an elliptical orbit .",
    "a process consisting of a sequence of shifts in spring constant without contact with a heat bath can therefore be visualised as transitions to , and movement along , a set of elliptical orbits in phase space .",
    "but if the process is cyclic , characterised by a return to the original spring constant , the final orbit will be circular .",
    "whether the energy of the system has increased or decreased as a result of the process then depends on whether the radius of the final orbit is greater than or less than the initial radius , respectively .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] for a process consisting of a shift down and up in spring constant .",
    "the implication is that both upward and downward changes in energy can be generated . with the exception of some special cases , where motion on the intermediate orbit consists of one complete circuit for example , in which case @xmath35 always , a cyclic process clearly produces a pdf that describes both positive and negative @xmath36 .     and",
    "it moves onto an elliptical orbit .",
    "the cycle is completed by a change in spring constant at @xmath37 to return the system to a circular orbit . depending on the initial location of the system on its orbit , and the duration of the process , the radius of the final orbit could be ( @xmath38 ) greater than or ( @xmath39 ) less than the initial radius , illustrating how the energy change can be both positive or negative .",

    "we write @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a complex phasor representing the phase and amplitude .",

    "we shall call @xmath50 the _ process matrix_.    the energy of an oscillation with phasor @xmath45 and angular frequency @xmath34 can be written as @xmath51 , so the change in energy brought about by the process is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the unit @xmath55 matrix . in terms of magnitude @xmath56 and phase @xmath57 : @xmath58 we find that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the initial energy of the oscillator , and the constants @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be expressed in terms of the elements of @xmath50 : @xmath64    let us consider a sequence of step changes in frequency from @xmath65 to @xmath66 at times @xmath67 , such that in the interval @xmath68 the displacement is represented by @xmath69 imposing continuity requirements for @xmath29 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 , we express @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 : @xmath74 the _ step _ matrix @xmath75 , representing the transformation from @xmath73 to @xmath72 through the relation @xmath76 , has the following structure : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 , corresponding to a rotation through phase angle @xmath80 , followed by a rescaling of the imaginary part of the phasor .",
