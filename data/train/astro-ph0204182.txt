    "galaxies span a wide range of morphology and luminosity , and a very useful way to quantify them is to fit their light distribution with parametric functions .",
    "the de  vaucouleurs @xmath0 and exponential disk functions became standard functions to use after de  vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) showed many elliptical galaxies to have @xmath0 light distributions , while freeman ( 1970 ) found later - type galaxies to be well described by a de  vaucouleurs bulge plus an exponential disk .",
    "since then , the empirical techniques of galaxy fitting and decomposition have led to a number of notable advances in understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these include investigations into the tully - fisher relationship ( tully & fischer 1977 ) , the fundamental plane of spheroids ( faber et al .",
    "1987 ; dressler et al . 1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ) , the morphological transformation of galaxies in cluster environments ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; van  dokkum , & franx 2001 ) , the bimodality of galaxy nuclear cusps ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ; faber et al . 1997 ) and its implications for the formation of massive black holes ( ravindranath , ho , & filippenko 2002 ) , and the cosmic evolution of galaxy morphology ( e.g. , lilly et al . 1998 ; marleau & simard 1998 ) .",
    "there are two general types of galaxy fitting : one - dimensional ( 1-d ) fitting of surface brightness profiles ( e.g. , kormendy 1977 ; burstein 1979 ; boroson 1981 ; kent 1985 ; baggett , baggett , & anderson 1998 ) , and 2-d fitting of galaxy images ( e.g. , shaw & gilmore 1989 ; byun & freeman 1995 ; de  jong 1996 ; simard 1998 ; wadadekar , robbason , & kembhavi 1999 ; khosroshahi , wadadekar , & kembhavi 2000 ) , with each its own tradeoffs and benefits .    in 1-d ,",
    "an important consideration is how to first obtain a radial surface brightness profile from a 2-d image , for which there is no universally agreed upon procedure .",
    "a common practice is to use isophote fitting , which is a powerful technique when performed on well - resolved galaxies because it averages over elliptical annuli to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) at a given radius .",
    "however , as many galaxies have isophote twists and changing ellipticity as a function of radius , the galaxy profile is extracted along a radial arc that is ill - defined .",
    "an alternative approach is to use a direct 1-d slice across an image .",
    "burstein ( 1979 ) argues that only cuts along the major axis should be used in bulge - to - disk ( b / d ) decompositions .",
    "meanwhile , ferrarese et al . (",
    "1994 ) point out that galaxies with power - law central profiles may have different profiles along the major and minor axis .",
    "fitting profiles in 1-d is frequently used because it suffices for certain goals , and is simple to implement .",
    "but many studies now resort to 2-d techniques . for b / d decompositions , a number of authors ( e.g. , byun & freeman 1995 ; wadadekar et al .",
    "1999 ) have used idealized simulations to show that 2-d modeling can better recover the true parameter values . in 1-d , while the galaxy bulge and disk may appear to merge smoothly , which causes non - uniqueness in the decompositions , in 2-d , isophote twists and ellipticity changes provide additional constraints to break those degeneracies .",
    "while exponential and de  vaucouleurs functions can model a wide range of global galaxy profiles , galaxies are generally more complex .",
    "well resolved , nearby galaxies are often poorly fit by the standard models in detail , especially in 2-d .",
    "yet , few studies have gone beyond a global bulge and disk decomposition , except in clear - cut cases where there are nuclear bars ( e.g. , de  jong 1996 ) or nuclear point sources ( e.g. , wadadekar et al .",
    "1999 ; portal 1999 ; quillen et al . 2001 ; and many recent studies of quasar host galaxies ) .",
    "more recently , a growing number of theories and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations show that many clues of galaxy formation lay hidden in the fine details of galaxy structure .",
    "images reveal striking correlations between nuclear cusps of galaxies with their mass , stellar velocity dispersion , radius , and other large - scale properties ( jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al . 1995 ; faber et al . 1997",
    "; carollo et al .",
    "1997 ; rest et al . 2001",
    "; ravindranath et al . 2001 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "those observations have led to on - going debates about whether the correlations can be explained by an adiabatic growth of black holes in isothermal cores and binary black hole mergers ( e.g. van der marel 1999 , and ravindranath et al .",
    "other fossil remnants of galaxy formation manifest as photometrically distinct nuclei , nuclear disks of stars and gas , dust lanes , and nuclear spiral patterns ( e.g. , phillips et al .",
    "1996 ; carollo , stiavelli , & mack 1998 ; tomita et al .",
    "2000 ; tran et al . 2001 ) .",
    "if elliptical galaxies form from 3:1 and 1:1 mass mergers , then naab & burkert ( 2001 ) merger simulations predict that all ellipticals should contain a significant embedded stellar disk component in order to explain the kinematic line profiles .",
    "is this seen , and if so , how often ?",
    "high resolution and high s / n images now permit this to be tested .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are intimately related to formation of bulges and black holes ; their fuel - starved remnants are common tenants in nearby galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) . yet",
    ", quantitative investigations of these central sources have often been hampered by the difficulties encountered in separating the faint nucleus from the surrounding bright bulge ( see , e.g. , ho 1999 ; ho & peng 2001 ; sarzi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to understand the physical implications of all these clues",
    ", one must be able to extract accurate , quantitative morphological information , via detailed galaxy decomposition .",
    "motivated by these and other possible applications , we developed a technique ( galfit ) to accurately model galaxy profiles .",
    "section 2 discusses the mechanics of our program and its computational requirements .",
    "section 3 provides an overview of our fitting procedures .",
    "section 4 presents a number of case studies to illustrate the versatility of the program .",
    "we then discuss 2-d decomposition to extract nuclear sources in   5 , using simulations to evaluate the recovery of point sources in 1-d compared to 2-d .",
    "then we apply our method to some nearby galaxies that contain weak nuclear sources .",
    "conclusions are given in ",
    "we make the source code readily available to the public upon request .",
    "we created a 2-d image decomposition program called galfit , written in the c language . in order to model galaxy profiles with a maximum degree of flexibility , galfit uses a number of functions and can combine an arbitrary number of them simultaneously . to use the program",
    "the user provides a simple input file , as shown in figure  1 . in the example we specify a fit using five functions simultaneously : a nuker function , a srsic , an exponential disk , a gaussian , and a uniform sky pedestal ( see below for details ) .",
    "additional components can be added by extending the list without limit , except by the computer memory and speed available to the user .",
    "all recorded images carry an imprint of the observing set - up , due either to imperfections or diffraction in the telescope optics , and sometimes by the atmosphere . to measure the intrinsic profile of an object",
    ", the seeing must be taken into account either by convolution or deconvolution techniques . even with _",
    "wfpc2 , whose optics are noted for near perfectly sharp , diffraction - limited , point - source images , @xmath1 of stellar light falls outside @xmath2 of its core .",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) of nicmos on _ hst _  has even more pronounced structure ; the diffraction wings are extended , and @xmath3 of the flux lies beyond @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "one way to remove the seeing is to deconvolve the image .",
    "lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show that galaxy images with high s / n at the center can be accurately deconvolved using @xmath6 iterations of lucy - richardson algorithm , if an accurate psf is available .",
    "an alternative approach uses convolution , where one constructs a model image and convolves it with a psf before comparing the result to data .",
    "while both techniques rely on knowing an accurate psf , deconvolution has benefits when the s / n is high  the observed image needs only to be deconvolved once and one does not have to assume a particular model for the intrinsic image .",
    "however , deconvolution will not work well for low - s / n or undersampled images because it may amplify poisson and pixellation noise .",
    "in contrast , the convolution scheme works on images with both high or relatively low s / n .",
    "the drawback is that fitting an image proceeds more slowly because convolution is done repeatedly , which is computationally intensive .",
    "another disadvantage is that one needs to have reasonable a priori knowledge of the input model .",
    "galfit uses convolution , but it can be turned off if not needed .",
    "convolution is done by using the convolution theorem : we multiply the fourier transforms of the psf and the models , and then inverse transform them .",
    "details of the convolution and fitting processes are elaborated below .",
    "the four input images for galfit are the ccd image of the galaxy , a noise array , a psf , and an optional dust ( or bad pixel ) mask  all in fits image file format .",
    "pixels in the dust mask are rejected from the fit .    during the fit , @xmath7 ( the reduced @xmath8 )",
    "is minimized , defined in the standard way as    @xmath9    where    @xmath10    @xmath11 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the @xmath14 and @xmath15 image dimensions ; and @xmath16 is the image flux at pixel @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 is the sum of the @xmath19 functions @xmath20 employed , where @xmath21 are the 2-d model parameters .",
    "the uncertainty as a function of pixel position , @xmath22 , is the poisson error at each pixel , which can be provided as an input image .",
    "if no noise image is given , one is generated based on the gain and read - noise parameters contained in the image header .        to fit galaxy and compact source profiles",
    "we assume the profiles all are axially symmetric , generalized ellipses .",
    "the form of the generalized ellipse is motivated by athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1990 ) who originally use it to describe galaxy bar shapes .",
    "when the principle axes of the ellipse are aligned with the coordinate axes , the radial pixel coordinate is given by    @xmath23    an offset of 2 in the exponents is used so that a pure ellipse has @xmath24 , a boxy shape @xmath25 , and a disky shape @xmath26 .",
    "this serves exactly the same purpose as the cos  @xmath27 fourier coefficient frequently associated with isophote fitting ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 differs from the cos  @xmath27 fourier coefficient in that the latter applies to individual isophotes locally while the former applies to an entire component .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is the ratio of the minor to major axis of an ellipse .",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath28  for each model are constant as a function of radius , although they are free parameters .",
    "figure 2_a _  and 2_b _  show two examples of azimuthal shapes as a function of @xmath28 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the pa of a component is defined with respect to the image pixel coordinate system such that a major axis positioned vertically is @xmath32 ( nominally north if rotated to the standard orientation ) and increases counter - clockwise ( nominally toward the east ) .",
    "when creating a model image , galfit decides whether or not to oversample the pixels based on their distance from the centroid of a model component . for pixels far away from the center , the gradient is shallow ; it suffices to sample only at the center of each pixel .",
    "but pixels near the center of a component must be over - sampled .",
    "for many cases dividing the pixels up by square grids then summing the flux :    @xmath33    is sufficient .",
    "however , for the nuker profile ( see below ) , when @xmath34 is large the function changes very quickly around @xmath35 , and the simple method quickly becomes inaccurate .",
    "we devise a technique to integrate the pixels around the center ( @xmath36 ) by using an elliptical polar grid that adapts to the ellipticity of the galaxy .",
    "figure  3_a _  and 3_b_demonstrate the gridding for axis ratios of 0.9 and 0.3 .",
    "the angular spacing is a 1-degree interval in a circular polar coordinate , modulo a tilt by the inclination of the component .",
    "the radial spacing of the grids increases geometrically toward the center following    @xmath37    where @xmath38 increases closer to the center .",
    "empirically , astep = 0.01 works well for even the steepest nuker profile , and we keep it as a constant in the fit .      * the srsic profile . *  the srsic ( 1968 ) profile has the following form :    @xmath39}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the effective radius of the galaxy , @xmath41 is the surface brightness at @xmath40",
    ", @xmath38 is the power - law index , and @xmath42 is coupled to @xmath38 such that half of the total flux is always within @xmath40 . for @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; at low @xmath38 , @xmath45 flattens out towards 0 and is obtained by interpolation .",
    "the original de  vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) profile is a special case with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "while the de  vaucouleurs profile is well suited for `` classical '' bulges , some bulges may be better represented by exponential profiles ( e.g. , kormendy & bruzual 1978 ; shaw & gilmore 1989 ; kent , dame , & fazio 1991 ; andrekakis & sanders 1994 ) .",
    "the elegance of the srsic profile is that it forms a continuous sequence from a gaussian ( @xmath48 ) to an exponential ( @xmath49 ) to a de  vaucouleurs ( @xmath46 ) profile simply by varying the exponent .",
    "it is very useful for modeling bars and flat disks ; the smaller the index @xmath38 is , the faster the core flattens within @xmath50 , and the steeper the intensity drop beyond @xmath51 .",
    "the flux , integrated over all radii for an elliptical srsic profile with an axis ratio @xmath29 is    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the gamma function .",

    ", the srsic model has eight free parameters : @xmath58 , pa . we note that in place of fitting @xmath41 , @xmath54 is fitted instead , which is more often a useful parameter .",

    "most disky galaxies are not composed of a single exponential disk , but also have either a central srsic or de  vaucouleurs component .",
    "they may also have either a flat core or a truncated disk , which deviates from a simple exponential ( e.g. , van  der  kruit 1979 ; pohlen , dettmar , & ltticke 2000 ) .    * the nuker law .",
    "*  the `` modified nuker '' law was initially proposed by lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to fit the diverse inner 1-d profiles of galaxies observed with _",
    "its high degree of flexibility makes it an excellent model for fitting most 1-d galaxy profiles .",
    "the functional form of the nuker law , which can be thought of as a double power law mediated by a smooth transition , is the following :    @xmath64 ^{\\frac{\\gamma-\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    this function has five adjustable parameters : @xmath65 and @xmath34 . taken to the limits of large and small radii , the parameter @xmath34 is the slope of the inner power law , and @xmath66 is the slope of the outer power law .",
    "the break radius @xmath67 is the location where the profile changes slope , @xmath68 is the surface brightness at @xmath67 , and @xmath69 describes how sharply the two power laws connect .",
    "the more positive @xmath69 is , the sharper is the break at @xmath67 . in galfit , we fit the surface brightness magnitude @xmath70 instead of @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath70 is obtained from @xmath68 via the use of the exptime image header parameter and the pixel size specified in item k of fig .  1 .",
    "although the profile appears singular at the center when sampled at @xmath35 , the integrated flux is finite for @xmath71 .",
    "the 2-d nuker profile has a total of 10 free parameters : @xmath72 , pa .    although the parameters in equation 1 correlate , the larger @xmath69 is ( i.e. the sharper the break ) , the less coupled are @xmath69 , @xmath66 , and @xmath34 , when @xmath67 is well resolved ( but much smaller than the image radius ) .",
    "the parameter coupling between @xmath66 and @xmath34 is small for @xmath69 fixed at a value @xmath73 , which is a useful reference point . in this case , varying @xmath66 across its whole range of typical values ( @xmath74 ) would affect the slope of @xmath34 measured within @xmath75 by @xmath76 , for any given value of @xmath34 .    * the gaussian profile . *  the gaussian function and its total flux are    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is 2.355@xmath79 .",

    "the moffat profile with @xmath38 of 1.5 or 2.5 is empirically similar in shape to the observed wfpc2 psf , while @xmath49 corresponds to a lorentzian function .",
    "it has fwhm @xmath84 .",
    "the moffat model has eight free parameters in 2-d .      to create a true point source ,",
    "one normally creates a @xmath85-function that is then convolved with the input psf .",
    "but in galfit we approximate a @xmath85-function by using a gaussian ( or moffat ) function having a small width , usually fwhm @xmath86 pixel .",
    "the benefit of using a functional representation is that the algorithm can smoothly transit between fitting a true point source or a compact source without a loss of generality .",
    "spiral galaxies can have embedded bars , and to model them we prefer to use the srsic profile with initially a relatively flat inner and a steep outer profile ( @xmath87 ) , and a boxy shape ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the true light distribution of a bar also has a bulbous component at the center , distinct from the bulge .",
    "therefore one should in principle use two components .",
    "however , the round component may be partially degenerate with the bulge itself unless the two profiles are significantly different .",
    "one design consideration of galfit is to efficiently fit well - resolved galaxies in large - format images , using an arbitrary number of model components . in our examples ,",
    "the nearby galaxies extend beyond the planetary camera ( pc ) chip of 800@xmath88800 pixels .",
    "as will be shown , they can be fit accurately with typically three or more components , involving 20 or more free parameters .",
    "fitting uncropped images is computationally intensive , and convolving entire images can often usurp @xmath89 of the computing time and memory .",
    "however , in nearly all cases the seeing has significant impact only near the central few arcseconds of a galaxy . to make fitting large - format images manageable ,",
    "we convolve only the area most affected by the seeing ( fig .",
    "1 , parameters h and i ) ; the process is described below .",
    "but the region can be enlarged by the user as required .",
    "we find that a convolution radius of at least 20 to 30 seeing disks away from the center suffices for a wide range of nuclear profile shapes .",
    "for the _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 , this can correspond to a region as small as @xmath90 pixels .    in our implementation ,",
    "computation time depends on the convolution size , the number of parameters to fit , and the size of the fitted image .",
    "table 1 shows the approximate resources used in running galfit for srsic and exponential disk fits where all parameters are free , as well as more complicated cases .",
    "the total computation time required to reach convergence is estimated for an intel pentium iii 450 mhz computer with 128 megabytes of memory .",
    "we give an overview of the inner working of galfit to clarify the use of the parameters shown in the top section of figure  1 .",
    "although we will go into significant detail , we emphasize that the the actual fitting process is completely transparent to the user , who needs only to prepare an input template shown in fig .  1 .",

    "all convolutions are done with fft , a technique found in many numerical computation texts ( e.g. , press et al .",

    "the small field of view ( fov ) of nicmos ( @xmath93 ) makes it difficult to find a psf calibrator in the same image for nearby galaxies .",

    "the accuracy mostly depends on the encircled energy curves and general structures of the diffraction pattern , and to a lesser extent on the fine details .",
    "hence , the use of tiny tim psfs should be adequate for ( de)convolution .",

    "another kind of failure is when the solution settles into a local @xmath8 minimum and does not get out , but this will not cause galfit to crash . for example , in b / d decompositions , there are correlations between the scale - length and luminosity parameters ( see , e.g. , byun & freeman 1995 ) , while ellipticities , centers , and position angles are generally more decoupled and better constrained by the data .",

    "the software provides the option to not subtract a fitted profile , thereby leaving it in the residual image ( item z ) .      once a fit has been optimized , galfit estimates the uncertainties analytically .",
    "we assume that the surface of constant @xmath105 , as a function of _ n _ free parameters , away from the minimum @xmath8 can be approximated by an _",

    "figure  4 shows an example for a 2-parameter ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) fit , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are correlated .",

    "written explicitly ,    @xmath121 and @xmath122 in figure 4 ) .",
    "we settle for this possible overestimate , but do not consider it to be serious , because the fundamental limitation in determining precise errors is that we do not know how the @xmath8 `` valley '' may twist near the best fit @xmath8 or how well it is represented by a hyper - ellipsoid .",
    "furthermore , the parameters we fit may not be all normally distributed .",
    "we verified using artificial data with poisson noise that our method produces reasonable uncertainty estimates for simple models consisting of one and two input components .",
    "uncertainty estimates quoted in the text and table below are obtained using the method described unless otherwise stated .",
    "the uncertainty estimate just described is only valid when the solution has reached a global minimum .",
    "however , the @xmath8 topology for galaxy fitting is complex with many local minima ( degeneracies ) because the parameter space is large ( e.g. , @xmath123 parameters for two or more srsic components ) .",
    "while no algorithm can guarantee convergence on the global minimum @xmath8 , sophisticated simulated annealing ( also known as metropolis or annealing for short ) algorithms are often the engine of choice for automating b / d decompositions , where they are reputed to be robust .",
    "in contrast , though vastly more efficient , the gradient method may head downhill blindly , regardless of whether it is going toward a global @xmath8 minimum . despite this shortcoming",
    ", we use the downhill - gradient / parabolic expansion method of levenberg - marquardt ( press et al .",
    "1997 ) as our minimization engine , for reasons given below .",
    "an algorithm that uses simulated annealing is gim2d , developed by simard ( 1998 ) for two - component b / d decomposition . in this method",
    ", the annealing ( i.e. , cooling ) `` temperature '' step size controls the rate of convergence on a solution . at each iteration ,",
    "a set of parameters is perturbed randomly by some amount ; high temperatures correspond to large perturbations .",
    "then , the probability @xmath124 that the parameter set is the true one is calculated .",
    "if this new probability is higher than the previous , @xmath125 , the new parameter set is adopted .",
    "however if the new set is less likely , there is nonetheless a finite chance @xmath126 that it is adopted . at some point",
    "the temperature is decreased and the iteration continues until convergence .",
    "the application of the software is demonstrated in several studies ( e.g. , marleau & simard 1998 ; simard 1998 ) .",
    "fitting more than two components dramatically increases the complexity of the @xmath8 topology , and extending the annealing technique to fit more components would seem to be sensical .",
    "however , in practice it is tricky to find an optimum cooling rate that can generally accommodate the different number , and type , of components a galaxy might require .",
    "anneal too quickly , the solution settles into a local @xmath8 minimum ; too slowly , the program converges even more inefficiently .",
    "efficiency is an issue because increasing the number of parameters makes it exponentially more cumbersome to adequately sample the parameter space for calculating probabilities . as an extreme example , to fit the double nucleus of m31 accurately",
    ", one needs 6 components , having 41 to 50 free parameters ( peng 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , for highly resolved nearby galaxies , one generally has to create dust masks and test out the components iteratively .",
    "this occasional need for interaction makes both the speed and the straightforward implementation of the downhill - gradient method attractive",
    ".    the downhill - gradient method may not be quite as well optimized for b / d decomposition as the simulated annealing method .",
    "however , a direct comparison between the two methods is needed to evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses .",
    "we discuss below (   3.3 ) how to test for degeneracies",
    ". it may also be possible to tailor a hybrid gradient - search and annealing method , which tries to climb out from a local minimum by briefly using monte - carlo sampling after the solution has been optimized by the gradient search .",
    "this is being considered for future updates to galfit .",
    "most bulges and late - type galaxy nuclei that are well resolved by _ hst_appear as smooth and simple spheroids on large scales when one disregards the occasional dust .",
    "but , as we will show below , simple one or two component fits frequently produce large residuals that have bipolar or quadrupolar symmetry , which can be reduced with additional components .",
    "this subtlety makes estimating the required number of components a trial - and - error process , and occam s razor suggests using the fewest number necessary , based on the goal of the experiment .",
    "we determine the number and types of components iteratively , often by starting out with a srsic or a nuker profile for ellipticals , and a srsic plus an exponential for spirals . based on @xmath8 and the pattern of residuals ,",
    "we determine if we need to replace them with more flexible models or add in more components .",
    "to use galfit in a typical manner such as for b / d decomposition , we point out that there is little to no human interaction beyond preparing an initial parameter file .",
    "however , our task of accurately fitting nearby large galaxies is considerably more challenging , thus we outline the steps we normally take :    1 .   create a dust / bad pixel mask by hand .",
    "we create a mask by outlining the affected region with a polygon , then feed the list of pixels into galfit either as a text file or a fits image .",
    "2 .   estimate by eye the number of components needed .",
    "although not needed , it sometimes helps to initially hold the diskiness / boxiness parameter @xmath28 fixed until the algorithm has found a plausible solution . the radicands in the radius equation [ 1 ] have absolute value quantities ; hence",
    ", the derivative images contain regions of discontinuity that cause the downhill - gradient method to react sensitively unless near a minimum .",
    "if convolution is needed , leaving it off initially saves time until a reasonable solution has been attained .",
    "if a galaxy is difficult to fit near the center , we restrict fitting to that region until a good solution is found , then enlarge the fit . 6 .",
    "optimize all the parameters in a @xmath8 sense .",
    "examine the residuals to decide whether more components need to be added , make better pixel masks , free parameter values that have first been held fixed , or turn on convolution .",
    "repeat previous steps as necessary .      in this paper and in other related studies ( peng 2002 ; ho et al .",
    "2002 ) , we find that galaxy light profiles can generally be modeled accurately ( in a @xmath8 sense ) using three to five components",
    ". the larger - than - usual number of components immediately prompts the question of how unique is the decomposition .",
    "degeneracy is a common problem in galaxy decompositions , mostly because the model functions used are not selected based on physical criteria .",
    "one can , in principle , decompose a galaxy with as many `` basis functions '' as one might contrive .",
    "even when a set is well defined , such as in two - component b / d decompositions , the large number of parameters involved makes degeneracy sometimes an issue , as shown in the simulations of byun & freeman ( 1995 ) and wadadekar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . extending to more components might ,",
    "at first sight , make the situation unmanageable .",
    "one way to reinforce our confidence in _ parameter _",
    "uniqueness is to use monte - carlo simulations to search the parameter space , but these say nothing about whether a given _ combination of models _  is the appropriate or unique set .",
    "moreover , searching randomly may be unfeasible because the dimensionality is over 20 , and occasionally over 40 . however , while there are potentially many local @xmath8 minima solutions , in practice the situation is not hopelessly degenerate . imposing the demand that models fit galaxies with high fidelity ( @xmath127 )",
    "severely reduces the possible solution space for a given set of models ; most solutions can be easily dismissed based on @xmath8 analysis .",
    "such demand produces components that have significantly different scale lengths , axis ratios , etc ..    while there is no recipe to guarantee uniqueness in the fitting , there are ways to probe the parameter spaces exhaustively and to satisfy to one s own confidence that a solution is stable and insensitive to initial conditions .",
    "one way is to vary two parameters at a time on a cartesian grid of values in order to trace out the local @xmath8 contours .",
    "this technique is very useful when the number of parameters is low .",
    "however , the same technique quickly becomes intractable with increasing number of fitting parameters . to more effectively explore a wider @xmath8 topology , we propose the following technique of combining monte - carlo simulations and minimization .    1 .   randomly select a full set of parameters , possibly drawing from distributions of parameter values centered on the best - fit values .",
    "2 .   using these as initial values ,",
    "minimize the @xmath8 .",
    "repeat step 1 for many different sets of random initial guesses to see if they return the same optimized solution or to other equally plausible ones .",
    "the degeneracy situation , together with the use of more than three components , makes interpretation difficult , leading one to ask : `` what do all the components mean ? '' or `` why use so many components ? ''",
    "the answer depends on the prior goal : perhaps the most mundane answer is simply that a bulge is triaxial , or otherwise not well represented by our limited models . in this case two or more",
    "functions may be needed to describe the same entity that has meaning only when summed , but not individually .",
    "a different , but perhaps more interesting tactic is to explicitly seek out components motivated by theory .",
    "a case in point is the prediction by naab & burkert ( 2001 ) that there should be disks embedded in elliptical galaxies formed in galaxy mergers .",
    "the use of extra components may also be motivated by external data , such as evidence for a nuclear point source based on agn spectra , or decoupled cores based on kinematic data . to look for weak agn point sources ,",
    "it is especially important to deblend a large portion of an image accurately , rather than biasing the fit to regions that one can fit well .",
    "lastly , from a purely empirical standpoint , one can decompose a galaxy simply to look for structures too subtle to be seen in full light , such as weak nuclear bars , stellar disks , and nuclear point sources .",
    "again , accurate decomposition here is crucial so that the residuals do not undermine the detection or believability of weak sources .",
    "the last scenario brings the discussion back in full circle to the issue of degeneracy . despite possible degeneracies in decomposing large - scale components , smaller structures are better localized , and better defined in size and shape .",
    "even if there is doubt as to what the exact profile and parameters are , often different models can reproduce a component with similar overall characteristics ( e.g. , profile , scale - length , shape , and orientation ) , even if they are not exactly identical . that a similar component is repeatedly borne out through different profile assumptions",
    "is in principle the keystone of its reality , since its inclusion is essential to achieving a reasonable model fit in that region of the image .",
    "we show a few such cases below .",
    "in the discussion to follow , we present galfit decomposition of galaxies having a wide variety of properties and shapes in order to test how well nearby galaxies can be modeled in 2-d by parameterized functions .",
    "we apply galfit to images of 7 galaxies that have a wide range of interesting properties : different shapes , morphologies , isophote twists , and internal disks .",
    "our wfpc2 data come from the _ hst _  archive .",
    "we remove the edges which are affected by ccd readouts , and fit models to @xmath128 pixel images .",
    "the galaxy nuclei in these images have very high s / n and are centrally placed in the pc .",
    "they often extend well beyond the wfpc2 fov , and the exposures are short ( several hundred seconds , see table 1 ) , making the sky background and image bias level hard to estimate from the wide field chips .",
    "given the typical exposure times of our images , the 26 mag arcsec@xmath129 isophote is about 0.01  0.05 adu .",
    "we set the sky to zero in our fitting , unless specifically mentioned otherwise",
    ".    figures @xmath130 and figure @xmath131 show the original images as well as the residuals in positive greyscale .",
    "we show two panels of residuals .",
    "the first ( panel _ b _ ) illustrates the traditional decomposition technique using only a one - component bulge and disk , occasionally adding a bar and a point source when obviously needed .",
    "we use a srsic or nuker function instead of de vaucouleurs model for the bulge .",
    "the second residual panel ( panel _ c _ ) shows a more accurate decomposition using the components listed in table 3 .    beneath the images are plots of the surface brightness profile , pa , ellipticity , and cos  @xmath27 obtained by running the iraf task _",
    "ellipse_. the surface brightness plot shows the _ observed _  profile ( i.e. , without deconvolution ) as solid circles with error bars .",
    "the short - dashed line going through those points is a 1-d nuker law that best fits the observed profile ; this is merely to illustrate the flexibility of the function , as well as to guide the eye for deviations from smoothness or power - law behavior .",
    "the long - dashed lines show the _ intrinsic _  profile of each component listed in table 3 from 2-d decomposition . finally , the solid line is the net sum of all the components that make up the intrinsic profile .",
    "therefore , it will rise above the observed points at the nucleus in cases when there is no point source .",
    "the dotted vertical line in these plots shows the region most affected by psf smearing , but in some cases the effect can be seen as far out as @xmath132 ( e.g. , ngc 221 ) .",
    "the ellipticity is defined as @xmath133 , where @xmath29 is the axis ratio , and the cos  @xmath27 plot shows whether the isophotes are disky ( @xmath134 ) or boxy ( @xmath135 ) , similar in definition to the @xmath28 parameter in galfit , but opposite in sign .",
    "table 3 summarizes all the fitting parameters ; the magnitudes have not been corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the magnitudes are based on the synthetic zeropoint calibrations by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which transform data units onto the landolt ubvri magnitude system .",

    "c _ , and column 16 lists the increase in @xmath7 for fits shown in figures _",
    "b_. we do not quote uncertainties for all the parameters individually . instead , in the last row of table 3 , we quote representative uncertainties derived in the fit ( see    2.6 ) as an ensemble .",
    "for most fits , `` representative '' means a conservative upper bound on the fitting parameters .",
    "comparing galaxy morphology / decompositions using inhomogeneous studies is difficult if they are based on images of limited fov and s / n .",
    "galaxies in low - s / n images have wings that are barely detectable above the sky noise , often biasing scale - length measurements toward lower values , if the noise is not accurately accounted or the suitable function is unknown .",
    "while low s / n in the wings is offset by a larger number of pixels , there is a practical tradeoff between areal increase and the rate of profile decline in the presence of sky and detector noise . in decomposing nearby galaxies",
    "there is an additional concern if they extend well beyond the fov of the ccd . since galaxy profiles tend to change shape , pa , and ellipticity with radius , in addition to the degeneracies discussed above , it is generally unsafe to extrapolate profiles beyond the fov .",
    "the galaxies in our examples below were all observed with wfpc2 .",
    "and although they have very high s / n in the core , they have short exposure times ( several hundred seconds ) .",
    "moreover , they show only the central regions of the galaxies . while they are perfectly suited for studying galaxy nuclei , profile comparisons with larger fov images are not straightforward .",
    "when we fit components whose scale - lengths are comparable to , or larger than , the fov , we do not necessarily believe the numbers to be accurate .",

    "however , a 2-d nuker fit leaves behind large residuals near the center ( fig .",

    ", the nucleus of ngc 4621 may appear to be pointlike because the isophotes are round and the profile is steep ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "but the three - component model fits the nucleus cleanly without the need to add in an unresolved point source .",
    "the nuclear region ( within @xmath155 ) of this e3 galaxy has boxy isophotes that become increasingly round at @xmath189 , but is otherwise uniform with no sign of dust lanes ( figure  8) .",
    "the kinematics of this galaxy have been studied in detail because the stellar velocities reverse direction @xmath190 from the center , appearing as though the galaxy has a kinematically distinct core with minor - axis rotation ( wagner , bender , mllenhoff 1988 ) .",
    "one scenario to explain kinematically distinct cores invokes mergers of galaxies that preserve their initial angular momentum vectors .",
    "an alternative is proposed by statler ( 1991 ) , who shows that dynamically smooth , circulating orbits in a triaxial potential can , in projection , cause the appearance of kinematic twists such as those observed in ngc 5982 . to distinguish between the orbital projection model from the merger model , statler ( 1991 )",
    "predicts that the former should produce a minimum in the velocity field along a direction somewhere between the minor and major axis .",
    "moreover , there should be a photometric core that is similar in size to the kinematic core .",
    "observations by oosterloo , balcells , & carter ( 1994 ) indeed suggest that there is such a trough present in the velocity field at pa = @xmath191 . but the ground - based surface photometry of this galaxy published by michard & simien ( 1988 ) and bender , dbereiner , & mllenhoff ( 1988 ) do not reveal a photometric core down to at least @xmath192 . although the kinematic peculiarity may be due to projection , oosterloo et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggest that the two effects : orbital projection and the merger of a small clump , may not be mutually exclusive events .    with _ hst _  images , we find that the radial profile nearly flattens off into a core interior to @xmath132 ( fig .  8) .",
    "there also appears to be a subtle break at @xmath193 , where the nucleus becomes significantly rounder .",
    "the 3  radius also corresponds closely to the peak of the rotation curve .",
    "the finding that the photometric core is at least an order of magnitude smaller than 7  rules out statler ( 1991 ) models ( t.  s. statler , 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "however , while the kinematically decoupled core may not be best explained by those models , the orbital projection effects proposed by statler ( 1991 ) may still play a role .",
    "8_b _  shows a one - component nuker fit that produces large quadrupole residuals at the center , but a relatively good fit farther out .",
    "the decomposition of this galaxy is complex and requires four components because of the large ellipticity gradient that tends toward zero near the center .",
    "nonetheless , the galaxy can be accurately decomposed ( fig .",
    "8_c _ ) ; the slight quadrupole residual pattern ( with rms fluctuations 1%-3% of the galaxy peak ) .",
    "the ellipticity gradient in figure  8 might be due to triaxiality . however , purely triaxial galaxies should also have confocal isophotes , but we find that the first component is significantly displaced from the rest by ( @xmath194ra , @xmath194dec ) = ( @xmath195 ) , suggesting there may have been a merger event proposed by oosterloo et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . forcing all the components to have the same position produces asymmetric residuals near the center , and increases @xmath139 by @xmath196 with @xmath197 .",
    "about @xmath198 ( 2.6 kpc in projected separation ) from the center of ngc 5982 , there is a galaxy that appears to have a double nucleus , although there is a remote chance it may be caused by dust .",
    "the dwarf galaxy s orientation points nearly directly toward the center of ngc 5982 .",
    "if this galaxy is indeed within the halo of ngc 5982 , not just due to projection , one is tempted to speculate that the dwarf companion is in the process of being tidally disrupted by the larger galaxy .",
    "to summarize , the profile of ngc 5982 flattens out into a core at @xmath199 , which is @xmath200 times smaller than that predicted by statler ( 1991 ) .",
    "although this finding rules out statler ( 1991 ) models , similar projection effects may still play a role in explaining the kinematically decoupled core .",
    "our finding of an off - centered , luminous , component at the core is probably evidence that this galaxy has had a recent merger episode .",
    "while early - type galaxies can be modeled well by ellipsoids , the obvious complication when fitting spiral galaxies is the presence of spiral arms and large - scale bars that are embedded in at least 50%60% of the objects ( e.g. , eskridge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "spiral arms can not be easily parameterized with our models , but often there is a diffuse disk of older stars underneath the arms that can be well described by an exponential disk ( e.g. , de  jong & van  der  kruit 1994 ; prieto et al .",
    "2001 ) , whose contrast with the arms is smaller in the near - infrared .",
    "the situation is different for galactic bars , as they can be fitted with a superposition of one or more analytic functions .",
    "we show a decomposition of an ordinary spiral and a barred galaxy .",
    "ngc 4450 ( fig .",
    "9 ) is an sab galaxy viewed at a low inclination angle ; its liner nucleus exhibits broad emission lines ( stauffer 1982 ; ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , which appear double - peaked in _ hst _  spectra ( ho et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we will later revisit ngc 4450 in the context of point - source extraction (   5.2.3 ) , but for now we focus only on the global galaxy morphology .",
    "the 1-d decomposition by baggett et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , assuming a spherical bulge and a circular disk , gives a b / d ratio of @xmath201 .",
    "the large scale disk of the galaxy extends well beyond the pc chip , thus we first fit the entire wfpc2 mosaic image to get a better handle on the disk parameters .",
    "to do so , we mask out the echelon region missing in the wfpc2 fov , and fit the remaining three quadrants plus the pc chip by assuming the components are individually axisymmetric .",
    "then , holding the parameters of the disk fixed , we fit only the pc chip while allowing the nuclear components to optimize . decomposing the galaxy using the classic two - component model ( de  vaucouleurs and exponential disk )",
    "gives b / d = 0.23 , with @xmath202 and @xmath203 , but the fit is poor . in comparison to baggett",
    "( 1998 ) , our scale - length measurement is about twice as large .",
    "part of this large difference may be attributed to our inability to determine an accurate background sky value because of the limited fov of wfpc2 ; we set the sky level to 26 mag arcsec@xmath129 ( 0.07 adu ) .",
    "an initial two - component decomposition of the wfpc2 mosaic reveals what appears to be a bar .",
    "this identification is reinforced in a three - component fit ( srsic bulge , exponential disk , and a bar ) that shows the bar to have a flat profile within @xmath40 but steep fall off beyond it ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "however , the identification may not be secure because of the missing quadrant in the mosaic . for the purpose of decomposing the pc chip , this is not crucial , so we assume that such a component exists .",
    "after optimizing the parameters for the disk and bar , we hold them fixed when fitting the bulge on the pc chip . through trial and error , we find that the bulge itself is better fit by summing two srsic components ; neither one alone should be regarded with high significance because the bulge is severely affected by dust .",
    "if one were to fit the bulge with a single component , figure  9_b _  shows that the northern and southern regions of the nucleus would be oversubtracted .",
    "the central dark patches are probably oversubtractions , rather than dust obscuration , because the round and bipolar shape of the residuals contrasts sharply in appearance with the irregularity of the surrounding dust lanes . with some confidence in the global components , we fit the remaining point source on top of the nucleus , and the result of the fit is listed in table 3 .",
    "to summarize , we use five components for ngc 4450 : a bar , a disk , a nuclear point source , and a bulge made up of two srsic functions . in this decomposition",
    ", the bulge is somewhat fainter than the standard b / d analysis , in part because of the contribution of the bar , but also because the nucleus is steeper than a de  vaucouleurs profile .",
    "we find b / d @xmath205 0.09 if the bar is left out , or b / d @xmath205 0.13 if it is included with the bulge .",
    "ngc 7421 is an sbbc galaxy seen at low inclination .",
    "the bulge and the bar are displaced from the center of the disky envelope , while the western bar truncates in a `` bow - shock''-like spiral arm .",
    "h  i column - density maps show a `` wake '' that suggests that ngc 7421 is plowing through , and interacting with , the intracluster medium in which it is embedded ( ryder et al . 2000 ) .",
    "decomposition of this galaxy in 2-d requires at least four components in order to fit a bulge , a disk , and a bar ( fig .  10 ) . as with other spiral galaxies ,",
    "obtaining a plausible disk contribution requires using a fov beyond that of the pc .",
    "so we proceed in a similar fashion to ngc 4450 , by first fitting the mosaic image , followed by optimizing over the pc region separately while holding the large - scale disk component fixed .",
    "a sky pedestal of 21.6 mag arcsec@xmath129 ( 1.1 adu ) was determined from the edges of the mosaic . removing the model of the galaxy",
    "reveals a faint dust lane that runs along the bar through the nucleus .",
    "moreover , there is an unresolved compact nuclear component that can be characterized by a gaussian ; this component has also been noted by carollo et al .",
    "the `` bulge '' is composed both of an intrinsic galaxy bulge plus the round component of the bar ( components 2 and 3 ) ; the two are difficult to distinguish . without the fainter of the two bulge components ,",
    "figure  10_b _ shows doughnut - shaped residuals .",
    "the luminosity of the summed components of the `` bulge '' rivals that of the bar ( component 2 ) , while the single most luminous component is the exponential disk .",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratio , excluding the bar component , is b / d @xmath205 0.06 ; including the bar with the bulge , b / d @xmath205 0.15 .",
    "a common application of galaxy decomposition is to extract reliable measurements of nuclear point sources embedded in a host galaxy .",
    "while luminous quasars can overpower the light of the host galaxy , the opposite extreme is the case for the more garden - variety agns in nearby galaxies , where the nucleus is overwhelmed by the glare of the galaxy bulge .",
    "photometric decomposition is absolutely crucial to properly disentangle the nuclear component .",
    "to do so , a central compact source or point source can be added on top of the normal galaxy profile to represent the agn ( e.g. , kotilainen et al .  1992 ; portal 1999 ) .",
    "implicit in this technique is the assumption that the galaxy profile can be extrapolated all the way into the center by fitting the asymptotic galaxy wings using standard functions such as the de  vaucouleurs plus exponential ( portal 1999 ) or gaussian profiles ( carollo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "when fitting faint nuclear point sources , the adopted form of the galaxy profile is crucial because all functions differ widely in steepness near @xmath35 .",
    "this is compounded by the fact it is difficult to fit profiles accurately on large and small scales simultaneously ; most of the weight is dominated by outer regions where there are more pixels , at the expense of few pixels in the center . to overcome these complications , it is tempting to simply exclude the outer regions .",
    "but in so doing the intrinsic steepness of the galaxy profile is less well constrained . as galaxy nuclei continue to rise as a power law even in the absence of central sources ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) , this practice easily produces fake compact source detections  a power law profile can always be artificially decomposed into a steeply rising line plus a compact source .",
    "finally , if even the slowly varying region surrounding the bulge can not be well fit , the harder task of fitting the steeply rising inner region should be even more dubious .",
    "therefore , the desired goal should be to fit the entire nuclear region as accurately as possible when trying to interpret and extract faint compact sources at the central few pixels .",
    "we first compare the merits of 1-d and 2-d point - source extractions .",
    "some arguments made in favor of 2-d techniques in the context of b / d decomposition are directly applicable here .",
    "the 1-d profile extracted from images is affected by several factors : the seeing , the different ellipticities , profiles , and shapes of the various galaxy components , a possible point source , and other nuclear features such as dust .",
    "there are few pixels near the nucleus , so the inner isophotes are sensitive to small - scale features such as dust , which can affect the centroiding and the shape of the nuclear profile .",
    "miscentering can lead to uncertainties in the central source profile in images where the psf may be undersampled , as is the case with wfpc2 .",
    "as an example of the ambiguity that can be encountered in extracting a weak nuclear point source in 1-d , figure  11 shows fits of the azimuthally averaged profiles ( without deconvolution ) of ngc 4143 and ngc 4450 .",
    "different assumptions can also lead to conflicting evidence for a compact source . in 1-d , for example , it is impossible to tell whether the inflection at @xmath206 is caused by circumnuclear dust or is a true sign of a photometrically distinct compact component .",
    "it is far easier to gauge the reality of compact sources in 2-d based on the residuals of the model - subtracted image .    to compare the relative effectiveness of 1-d versus 2-d recovery techniques , we added point sources to three real galaxies used in this study .",
    "a point source has only three free parameters ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 position and brightness ) , thus is easier to simulate and recover uniquely than compact sources , providing the psf is accurate .",
    "our simulations give only qualitative guidelines for comparing the relative merits of 1-d and 2-d decompositions ; we do not cover all possible scenarios .",
    "other simulations of point - source recovery have been done by wadadekar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who use idealized galaxies with exponential disks and srsic profiles to explore a much wider range of parameter space .",
    "we simulate faint nuclear sources by placing a psf on top of ngc 221 , ngc 4621 , and ngc 5982 .",
    "figures  5_a _ , 7_a _ , and 8_a _  show the original 2-d images of the galaxies with contours overlaid ; figures 5_c _ , 7_c _ , and 8_c _  give the 2-d model residuals . as shown in fig .",
    "8_d _ ngc 5982 has a global axis ratio of @xmath29 = 0.68 , a slightly boxy isophote shape , and a flat nuclear cusp of @xmath207 . for ngc 221 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 . for ngc 4621 ,",
    "@xmath187 at large radius and is disky at @xmath210 ; the nucleus is rounded by the seeing ( @xmath211 ) and has a steep power - law cusp of @xmath212 .",
    "these examples have no apparent compact source at the nucleus , no dust features , and span a wide range of nuclear slopes .",
    "ngc 4621 appears to have a pointlike nucleus only because it has a very steep cusp and because the nucleus is round .",
    "we have shown in ",
    "4.3.2 that ngc 4621 can be fit accurately without requiring a nuclear point source .",
    "we can model all three galaxies quite well in both 1-d ( using a single nuker profile ) and 2-d .",
    "we add tiny tim psfs with brightnesses 2 to 7 magnitudes fainter than the bulge , in 1 magnitude intervals , then extract them with the same psf .",

    "figure  13 compares the results of the extractions in 1-d versus 2-d , showing deviations between input and recovered magnitudes .",
    "the s / n of the images are as high as @xmath214 at the peak . when the point source is bright and",
    "the nucleus is moderately flat , the 1-d technique can recover the point sources well .",
    "but the recovery in 1-d becomes poor very quickly for a moderately dim source and a steep profile .",
    "for @xmath215 there is little accuracy even for relatively luminous sources .",
    "at the steep end of @xmath216 , the technique is completely unreliable .    by comparison , 2-d modeling can recover much fainter nuclear sources , although there is a slight systematic offset .",
    "the recovered magnitude in most cases is slightly fainter than the input magnitude , a consequence of the degeneracy between a steep galaxy profile ( parameterized using a nuker function ) and a point source .",
    "the use of the nuker function can overfit a steep cusp at the expense of a point source .",
    "for faint point sources and steep cusps , the opposite scenario may occur ; the recovered magnitude may be brighter than the input at the expense of a shallower cusp .    in agn studies , it is often informative to know the spatial extent of the nuclear source .",
    "direct non - stellar emission from a central engine is expected to be unresolved , even for the nearest agns , whereas reprocessed non - stellar light or a nuclear star cluster may be resolved . to test the source extent",
    ", one can fit an analytical psf function , such as the moffat profile described in   2.3.2 , with an adjustable width . in our simulations in 1-d , we find that the luminosity and width of the compact source depend sensitively on initial parameters because of degeneracies in the fits .",
    "we conclude that 1-d fitting generally gives unreliable measures of compactness for central sources . in our 2-d simulations ,",
    "the widths converge to that of a point source in every case , except for the faintest test sources .    for the purpose of extracting faint compact sources",
    ", we can constrain their parameters by exploring the degeneracies of the local minima in @xmath8 , and by fitting different nuclear models . in fact , the latter is a necessary exercise because different model assumptions may produce contradictory results because of profile ambiguities .",

    "the bulge can best be fit by an exponential and a nuker component .",
    "although the bulge component can also be well fitted by a superposition of a srsic ( @xmath219 mag , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 ) and an exponential ( @xmath222 mag , @xmath223 ) , overall the first combination gives formally a better fit .",
    "we list their parameters in table 3 .",
    "figure  14_b _  shows a fit where we use a single nuker component . although most of the bulge is removed , considerable over- and under - subtractions remain .",

    "<S> we present a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) fitting algorithm ( galfit ) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images , with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well - resolved , nearby galaxies observed with the _ hubble space telescope_. our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas , by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components , and with optimization in computation speed , suited for working on large galaxy images . </S>",
    "<S> we use 2-d models such as the `` nuker '' law , the srsic ( de  vaucouleurs ) profile , an exponential disk , and gaussian or moffat functions . the azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components . </S>",
    "<S> some potential applications of our program include : standard modeling of global galaxy profiles ; extracting bars , stellar disks , double nuclei , and compact nuclear sources ; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model . </S>",
    "<S> when examined in detail , we find that even simple - looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately , rather than the one or two components more often employed . many galaxies with complex isophotes , ellipticity changes , and position - angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-d . we illustrate this by way of 7 case studies , which include regular and barred spiral galaxies , highly disky lenticular galaxies , and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities . </S>",
    "<S> a useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare 2-d and 1-d extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness , and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei . </S>"
