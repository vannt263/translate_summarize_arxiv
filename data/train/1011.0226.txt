    ", the d  central fiber tracker has achieved the best resolution of about @xmath5{mm}$ ] using double layers of @xmath6{mm}$ ] thin fibers read out by visible light photon counters ( vlpcs)@xcite . vlpcs offer single - photon resolution due to a high internal gain of about @xmath7 and are linear up to hundreds of photons .",
    "the main drawback of vlpcs is that they have to be operated at cryogenic temperatures which introduces a significant overhead into the operation of scintillating fiber trackers as used in the d  and mice experiments .",
    "the chorus fiber tracker achieves a spatial resolution of @xmath8{mm}$ ] for a single ribbon of 7 layers of @xmath9{mm}$ ] thin scintillating fibers and uses ccd cameras instead of vlpcs for readout , as does the k2k scintillating fiber tracker .",
    "ccd cameras require image intensifiers to detect the few tens of photons that thin scintillating fibers emit for a minimum ionizing particle .",
    "image intensifiers and photomultipliers are sensitive to magnetic fields and require operating voltages of a few thousand volts .",
    "a new type of scintillating fiber tracker has become possible with the advent of silicon photomultipliers  @xcite ( sipms ) as a viable alternative for the commonly used photon detectors .",
    "sipms like vlpcs have a high intrinsic gain of @xmath10 but can be operated at room temperature .",
    "furthermore , they are insensitive to magnetic fields and are operated at voltages of @xmath11{v } - \\unit[80]{v}$ ] . another key feature of sipms are their compact dimensions .",
    "this allows the design of detector modules that have almost no dead area if integrated sipms are used as photon detectors .    in this article",

    "the tracker described here is being developed for use in the pebs  @xcite balloon - borne detector .",
    "it consists of layers made up from modules like the one depicted in figure  [ fig : moduleschematic ] .",
    "charged particles        traversing the module deposit energy in two ribbons of scintillating fibers that are located at the top and bottom of the module , creating scintillation photons .",
    "a small fraction of the scintillation light is then guided by total internal reflection to the fiber ends where it is detected by silicon photomultiplier arrays .",
    "each module thus allows two independent measurements of the intersection point of a trajectory .",
    "the modules are z - shaped which allows for them to be placed closely next to each other so that there are no gaps in a tracker layer .",
    "the overlap between the modules allows for internal alignment with tracks within one layer .",
    "each module consists of a mechanical support made up from low - density ( @xmath14 ) rohacell foam between two thin ( @xmath5{mm}$ ] ) carbon fiber skins .",

    "the fiber end is fixed with a fast curing adhesive and cut .",
    "the next fiber layer is wound on top of the first layer so that the fiber lies in the gap between fibers of the previous layer maintaining a constant fiber pitch over the layers .",
    "this process is repeated applying an adhesive to the fibers after each completed layer until five layers of fibers have been wound on top of the drum .",
    "after the last fiber layer has been completed , two aluminum end - pieces are screwed next to each other onto the drum to ease the handling of the fiber ribbon .",

    "the signals have to be attenuated in a resistor network on the front - end board by a factor of 150 to match the dynamic range of the chip .",
    "an external trigger generates a hold signal for the va chips on the front - end board with a delay of the shaping time of the preamplifier , so that the sipm signals are sampled and their amplitudes stored on the va_32/75 chips for readout .",
    "the stored analog signal heights are digitized sequentially by 12 bit sampling adcs on back - end boards .",

    "measurements of the key properties of the fibers are shown in the following : a long attenuation length and uniform thickness are vital for use in a large - area tracking device , while the angular emission spectrum is needed for an understanding of the observed spatial resolution .",

    "we conducted a separate measurement of the attenuation length for four @xmath33{m}$ ] long samples of kuraray fibers .",

    "in addition , the hamamatsu sipm arrays are protected by a glue layer of @xmath19{mm}$ ] thickness so that photons emitted by a fiber near the fringe of the sipm array may be lost due to the angular emittance distribution .",
    "these two geometrical effects lead to losses of @xmath104{\\%}$ ] , i.e.  only 53 photons reach the sensitive area of the sipm .",
    "the photon detection efficiency at an overvoltage of @xmath16{v}$ ] is @xmath105{\\%}$ ] so that the expected average signal is @xmath106 photo - electrons .",
    "this value has been marked by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb09_finalplot ] .",
    "we developed a monte carlo simulation of the detector to understand the dependence of the spatial resolution on light yield .",
    "the simulation of a passing particle starts with the generation of the primary energy deposition , based on the path length in each fiber and according to the appropriate distribution that was extracted from geant4  @xcite .",
    "the light - loss effects detailed in the previous section are taken into account to derive a mean number of photons for each fiber from which the actual number of photons to be distributed onto the sipm array is sampled from a poisson distribution .",
    "the response of the sipm array is modeled taking the geiger - mode readout , electronic noise , as well as the effects of pixel crosstalk and strip crosstalk into account .",
    "we use the appropriate probabilities as determined in laboratory measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allnoise ] ) for an overvoltage of @xmath16{v}$ ] , at which the sipm arrays were operated during the testbeam .",
    "in addition to these effects , we expect a contribution to the detector resolution from optical crosstalk between the fibers . as a first approach , this effect",
    "is included here as an additional optical contribution to the electrical strip crosstalk probability of @xmath107 .",
    "the value for the optical crosstalk of @xmath108 is a free parameter in the monte carlo simulation and has been adjusted to reproduce the cluster profile properties as measured in the testbeam .",
    "finally , fake hits are added according to the fake rate measured in the laboratory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allnoise ] ) . to illustrate the overall good description , we compare a typical noise spectrum , the distribution of cluster length , and the average signal cluster for testbeam data and simulation in figures [ fig : noise_sim ] , [ fig : length_sim ] , and [ fig : cluster_sim ] , respectively .",
    "the latter represents an especially important crosscheck , as the cluster shape depends crucially on all the effects mentioned above and at the same time , it is the basis for the calculation of the particle intersection point according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : clusterwmean09 ] ) .    the prediction of the monte carlo simulation for the detector resolution as a function of light yield is included in figure  [ fig : tb09_finalplot ] . for the light yield range relevant to our study",
    ", the results for the detector resolution @xmath90 in the simulation can be described as @xmath109 where @xmath61 is the light yield .",
    "a fit to the simulation results for scsf-78mj fiber modules with optical grease yields a value of @xmath110{mm}$ ] .",
    "it can be seen that the prediction of the monte carlo simulation is too optimistic by about @xmath111{mm}$ ] for the high - yield modules , and the resolution of the low - yield module is underestimated by roughly @xmath11{\\%}$ ] , but the trend of the data is well reproduced .",
    "an important issue that limits the spatial resolution achievable in the current configuration is the fact that the distribution of photons on the sipm array is smeared out over several channels because of the optical gap between sipm array and fiber .",
    "the photons have to bridge a distance of @xmath112{\\upmu{}m}$ ] defined by the optical glue that hamamatsu puts on their mppc 5883 sipm devices , to protect them against environmental and handling damage .",
    "while the influence of crosstalk and the closely linked strip crosstalk as well as the total detected light yield of the fibers play a dominant role for the achieved performance of the detector module , the thickness of the glue layer on top of the sipm devices can be modified much more easily since it does not require a complete redesign of the sipm .",
    "devices with a reduced glue layer of @xmath5{mm}$ ] have already been delivered by hamamatsu and should allow for a position resolution of @xmath113{mm}$ ] . a new generation of 64-channel sipm arrays with no additional glue layer has been designed and will become available in summer 2010 . in addition , the optical coupling has been optimized further . both effects",
    "together should allow for a position resolution of @xmath114{mm}$ ] according to monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is also obvious that optimized software algorithms which take the discrete structure of the detector into account could lead to further significant improvements .",
    "finally , monte carlo simulations show that the optimal readout pitch for a fiber detector constructed from @xmath0{mm}$ ] fibers would be @xmath115{mm}$ ] .",
    "in addition , the new 64-channel sipm arrays would also allow a double - sided readout of the fibers .",
    "these measures together would allow the construction of scintillating fiber tracker modules with high intrinsic redundancy and an ultimate position resolution of better than @xmath91{mm}$ ] according to monte carlo simulations .",
