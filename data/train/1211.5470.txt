    "@xmath0 bosons are a ubiquitous feature of theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) arising from various bsm scenarios such as @xmath2 gauge extensions of the sm motivated by supersymmetry or grand unified theories , kaluza - klein excitations of sm gauge fields or excitations of composite exotic vector mesons in technicolor theories to name a few .",
    "typically , such resonances are searched for at hadron colliders via the drell - yan ( dy ) production of a lepton pair , i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "the tevatron places limits on the @xmath0 mass , @xmath5 , at around 1 tev  @xcite ( for a sequential @xmath0 ) while the latest lhc limits lie around 2.3 tev  @xcite from this channel .",
    "several phenomenological studies on how to measure the @xmath0 properties and couplings to sm particles in this clean dy channel have been performed .",
    "these proceedings summarise a recently published paper  @xcite addressing the use of the top - antitop final state , i.e. , @xmath6 , to probe these @xmath0 properties .",
    "while it may not have as much ` discovery ' scope as the dy channel , owing to the large qcd background combined with the complex six - body final state and the associated reconstruction efficiency , it remains important to extract the couplings of new physics to the top quark .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the top decays before hadronising , transmitting spin information to its decay products , allows for the definition of spin asymmetry observables which provide an extra handle on @xmath0 couplings not present in non - decaying final states .",
    "we study the scope of the lhc to profile a @xmath0 boson mediating @xmath7 production , in both standard kinematic variables as well as spatial / spin asymmetries , by adopting some benchmark scenarios for several realisations of the sequential , left - right symmetric and @xmath8 based @xmath0 models ( specifically , the same as those in  @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the issue of distinguishability of various models using these observables is addressed .",
    "we define the asymmetry observables considered with the aim of determining their power to discriminate between @xmath0s .",
    "we refer the reader to our paper for a more detailed discussion on these as well as the selection of benchmark models , statistical uncertainties and definitions of significance .",
    "this study investigated charge ( spatial ) and spin asymmetries and their dependence on top couplings to profile and distinguish the models considered .    a selection of charge asymmetry variables",
    "were investigated with the most sensitive found to be @xmath9 , defined by the rapidity difference of the top and antitop , @xmath10 , while also cutting on the boost of the @xmath11 system .",
    "this increases the contribution from the @xmath12 initial state by probing regions of higher partonic momentum fraction , @xmath13 , where its parton luminosity is more important : @xmath14 the two spin asymmetries considered , termed double ( @xmath15 ) and single ( @xmath16 ) , are defined as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the number of observed events and its first(second ) argument corresponds to the helicity of the top ( anti)quark . these observables are alternatively known as the spin correlation and spin polarisation asymmetries respectively and can be extracted as coefficients in differential angular distributions of the top decay products .    defining a generic neutral current interaction with the feynman rule @xmath19 we can calculate the dependence of the asymmetries in terms of its vector and axial couplings @xmath20 and @xmath21 or alternatively , the left and right handed couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these were obtained using the helicity formulae from  @xcite in the case of the spin asymmetries ( also derived independently with the guidance of  @xcite ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the initial state and the top quark respectively : @xmath26 for a neutral gauge boson exchanged in the @xmath27-channel , with @xmath28 .",
    "the charge asymmetry depends on the product of the vector and axial couplings of both the initial and final state particle and can only be generated when all of these are non - vanishing .",
    "alternatively it is a function of the relative magnitudes of their right and left handed couplings . for the spin asymmetries ,",
    "@xmath29 depends on the couplings in a similar way to the total cross section becoming maximal in the limit @xmath30 , while @xmath31 is only non - vanishing for non - zero vector and axial couplings of the final state tops and is additionally sensitive to their relative sign .",
    "this is equivalent to measuring their relative handedness but only for the final state .",
    "note that @xmath31 allows for the direct measurement of this feature of the top couplings while this information is lost in the charge asymmetry due to the identical dependence on the initial state couplings .    with these unique coupling dependences ,",
    "it is our aim to show that asymmetries can provide extra information to distinguish @xmath32 models and ultimately contribute to extracting the couplings of an observed neutral resonance .",
    "we present a selection of results profiling the spatial and spin asymmetry distributions of the benchmark @xmath32 models compared to the sm including interference effects .",
    "the set of benchmarks are split into two categories : those with a vanishing vector or axial coupling ( the @xmath33 models with the ` b - l ' generalised left - right symmetric model ) are classed as the ` @xmath33 ' type while the rest , with both couplings non - zero , are referred to as the ` generalised ' models .",
    "the variables described in section  [ sec : defcalc ] were computed as a function of the @xmath11 invariant mass within @xmath34 gev and compared to the tree - level sm predictions .",
    "the code exploited for our study is based on helicity amplitudes , defined through the helas subroutines  @xcite , and built up by means of madgraph  @xcite .",

    "they include statistical uncertainties and fold in an estimated 10% reconstruction efficiency of the @xmath11 pair assuming the use of all possible decay channels .",
    "systematic uncertainties may also be important but would require a study beyond parton level .",
    "the figures show that the majority of benchmark models can be distinguished from one another using these variables , noting in particular the sensitivity of @xmath31 to the relative sign of the vector and axial couplings which allows for a clear distinction between the @xmath40 ( sequential ) and @xmath41 ( left - right symmetric ) models in the ` generalised ' category as described in equation  .",
    "@xmath29 depends on the couplings in the same way as the total cross section and therefore models that can not be distinguished in the invariant mass spectrum will remain so in this observable .",
    "it is clear that @xmath31 is the most powerful observable in that it provides the best distinguishing power along with the extra feature of being sensitive to the handedness of the top couplings .",
    "@xmath9 provides some distinction but the handedness sensitivity is not present for reasons discussed in the previous section . increasing the @xmath42 mass increases the statistical uncertainties but",
    "also slightly raises the central values , both as a consequence of the lower sm background .",
    "table  [ tab : signif_lhc14_al ] is an example of the statistical studies made where the significance of an observable ( in this case @xmath31 ) is examined assuming 100 fb@xmath39 of integrated luminosity . here ,",
    "the significance between various models is a measure of how well they can be distinguished . in almost all cases",
    "the significances are important , showing that this variable would certainly be effective in disentangling the ` generalised ' models with the discrimination decreasing slightly for higher masses .",
    "although not shown in these proceedings , a similar statistical analysis was performed in determining how much integrated luminosity would be required to achieve a significance of 3@xmath43 between models in the various observables .",
    "we showed that in most cases , the models can be distinguished at the relatively early stages of the lhc ( @xmath44  100  fb@xmath39 at 14 tev ) even for the higher mass of 2.5 tev .",
    "the cases where this is not possible reflect mostly instances where the couplings are too similar and would be difficult to disentangle .",

    "we have presented an overview of a phenomenological study on classes of @xmath32 models in both spin and spatial asymmetries of @xmath11 production and showed that there is much scope to observe deviations from the sm and even distinguish between various models , particularly for spin asymmetries .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath11 channel would certainly be a useful complement to the more popular dy channel in the aim of profiling a @xmath0 resonance should one be observed in the near future .",
    "it is worth noting that the classes of models studied are benchmarks put forward to set bounds on @xmath32 masses best probed in the di - lepton channels .",
    "other models could be better suited to the @xmath11 channel , such as leptophobic / top - phillic @xmath32s occurring in composite / multi - site and extra - dimensional models .",
    "the profiling techniques discussed in this study would be increasingly more applicable in these scenarios .    finally ,",
    "although not addressed in the paper to which these proceedings refer , one can ask whether more can be done in profiling an observed resonance with the view of extracting its fermionic couplings . a previous study attempting to do this in the light lepton sector",
    "@xcite finds a degeneracy in determining the quark and lepton couplings which can be solved by considering asymmetries in an alternate final state . in a more recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we show that asymmetry observables in the @xmath11 provide independent information which would break this degeneracy and allow for a fit to all couplings in the ` minimal ' framework of 5 independent couplings used in many benchmarks .",
