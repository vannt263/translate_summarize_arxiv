    "after recombination of the primordial plasma at redshift @xmath3 and before the epoch of reionization , the baryonic content of the universe was predominantly in the form of neutral hydrogen .",
    "for this reason , a promising way of probing this period in the evolution of the universe is through the observations of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen , created in the spin - flip transition between the two hyperfine levels of the hydrogen ground state ( for reviews of the 21 cm physics , its use in cosmology , and the foreground and calibration challenges see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there are several experiments that are currently in operation , or planned for the near future , for which a primary objective is observing the redshifted 21 cm signal , such as the low frequency array ( lofar ; @xcite ) , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite ) , the precision array to probe eor ( paper ; @xcite ) , and the square kilometer array ( ska ; @xcite ) .",
    "several pathfinder observations have recently placed upper limits on the 21 cm perturbation signal at @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , and @xmath6 @xcite , and measurements of the global spectrum have placed lower limits on the duration of the neutral - to - ionized transition @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm signal from high - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) is sensitive to the conditions of the gas , such as its density , ionization fraction , and spin temperature .",
    "the last can be coupled to the gas kinetic temperature through collisions ( in environments of sufficiently high density ) or via the wouthuysen - field effect @xcite in the presence of lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) photons .",
    "hence , understanding thermal properties of high - redshift igm is crucial for predicting and interpreting the observed 21 cm signal .    before the formation of the first sources of radiation , the first stars and galaxies",
    ", primordial gas was adiabatically cooling with the expansion of the universe  its temperature decreasing with redshift @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the onset of luminous structures dramatically changed that evolutionary track and the universe eventually became reheated and reionized . in a complete model of reionization , several different mechanisms can affect the temperature and the ionization state of the igm , such as heating by x - ray and uv photons as well as by shocks created in the gravitational collapse of matter . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the microphysics of the igm heating through its interaction with the uv photons .",
    "non - ionizing photons emitted by stars can freely travel through mostly neutral high - redshift igm until they are redshifted by the expansion of the universe into a resonant frequency of one of the atomic species present in the igm , at which point they resonantly scatter with atoms .",
    "this scattering can occur far away from sources of radiation . since hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and is mostly in its ground state at high redshifts prior to reionization ,",
    "the most significant resonance is the ly@xmath0 transition between the ground state and the first excited state of hydrogen ( @xmath9 , @xmath10  hz ) .",
    "there are two types of ly@xmath0 photons that need to be taken into account : photons emitted with frequencies between ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath11 can redshift directly into the ly@xmath0 resonance , whereas photons of higher energies ( between ly@xmath12 and the lyman limit ) can fall into one of the higher lyman resonances , from which they can cascade into ly@xmath0 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to distinguish these two types of photons , we call the first kind the _ continuum photons _ and the second kind the _ injected photons_.    the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons with hydrogen atoms causes transfer of energy from the radiation field to the gas due to atomic",
    "recoil , causing a change in the kinetic temperature of the gas ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this energy exchange leads to a drift of photons from higher to lower frequencies .",
    "another contribution to frequency drift , one that is present regardless of scattering , comes from the hubble expansion of the universe .",
    "scattering also causes a diffusion of photons in frequency space due to a maxwellian distribution of atomic velocities in the gas .",
    "photons on the red side of the ly@xmath0 line center mostly scatter with atoms moving toward them , and because of the doppler shift , the frequency of these photons is higher in the frame of the atom ; in other words , it is closer to the line center and the resonant frequency .",
    "the opposite occurs for the photons on the blue side of the line  they preferentially scatter off atoms moving away from them .",
    "frequent scattering between atoms and photons brings them closer to statistical equilibrium , reducing the average energy exchange per scattering @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the temperature and density of the gas , as well as gradients in its velocity , can change the ly@xmath0 scattering rates ( @xcite , @xcite ) and thereby affect the heating of the gas by ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to understand how the theory of igm heating by ly@xmath0 photons extends to the case of a realistic , inhomogeneous universe  whether the heating rate is just slightly modified by the perturbations , or whether effects such as thermal conduction can become important .    in this study",
    "we investigate the ly@xmath0 heating of hydrogen gas with underlying perturbations in the density , temperature , and baryonic velocity .",
    "we assume that these perturbations are small and consider their contribution only to linear order .",
    "we find that , as a consequence of perturbations , the gas heating rate can be altered by a few percent compared to the heating rate in a homogeneous medium .",
    "of particular interest are perturbations with scales comparable to or smaller than the diffusion length of ly@xmath0 photons . for perturbations on these scales ,",
    "photons can interact with hydrogen atoms located in regions with different properties than where the photons originated from , changing the gas heating rate .",
    "this process can therefore be viewed as thermal conduction between regions of different temperatures , which could lead to the damping of perturbations .",
    "the spatial redistribution of photons depends in a complicated way not only on the properties of the gas but also on the rate of frequency redistribution of photons since the scattering cross section ( and hence spatial diffusion coefficient ) varies by many orders of magnitude over the frequency range of interest .",
    "hence , as it is difficult to make a simple estimate of the diffusion length of photons , we solve the problem numerically .",
    "our results show that the scale at which perturbations start to counteract the mean effect , and hence damp the perturbations , corresponds to a wavenumber of @xmath13  mpc@xmath2 ( comoving ) .",
    "that length scale is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller that the jeans scale .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : at the beginning of section [ sec : form ] , we introduce the notation and outline the formalism that is used in our analysis .",
    "we continue by describing the radiative transfer equations and the resulting radiation spectra .",
    "heating rate calculations for the continuum and injected photons are described in section [ sec : hrate ] .",
    "we present our results in section [ sec : results ] and finally discuss and summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume the following values of the relevant cosmological parameters , obtained by the @xcite : @xmath14  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "our formalism is based on following the time evolution of photon phase - space distribution , which is governed by the boltzmann equation .",
    "the approach is similar to that developed for studying the cosmic microwave background @xcite , except that in our steady - state case , the nontrivial variable is frequency rather than the time . in our calculation",
    ", we neglect polarization since its effect on the radiation intensity is expected to be small , and to include it in the calculation would require tracking twice as many variables .",
    "we start the analysis by considering the phase - space density of photons of frequency @xmath17 , located at coordinate @xmath18 and propagating in direction @xmath19 , given by the occupation number @xmath20 .",
    "to simplify our equations , from now on we omit writing @xmath21 explicitly , although we assume such dependence in calculations . the occupation number @xmath22 consists of two parts , the mean isotropic part @xmath23 , and direction - dependent perturbations @xmath24 : @xmath25 the scale of perturbation is determined by its wavenumber @xmath26 . in the equations given throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath26 is used to denote the physical wavenumber , rather than comoving , which simplifies expressions .",
    "we convert to the comoving wavenumber only at the end when we report the final results and present them in figures .",
    "we assume that all perturbations are small and linear .",
    "so we can treat them independently , since in linear perturbation theory , different @xmath26-modes are decoupled form each other . the contribution of a single @xmath26-mode to @xmath24 can be expanded in a series of legendre polynomials with coefficients @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the projection of unit vector @xmath19 onto @xmath30 axis .",
    "the igm can be described by its mean number density @xmath31 and the mean gas kinetic temperature @xmath32 . however , for an inhomogeneous medium , the density and temperature fields are given by : @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are dimensionless parameters describing the amplitudes of density and temperature perturbations , respectively .",
    "we treat the photon field in the rest frame of the baryons - not the comoving frame - because a photon will resonantly scatter with an atom if the photon frequency matches the resonant frequency in the atom s rest frame . in that frame ,",
    "the overall mean velocity of atoms vanishes .",
    "we introduce linear perturbations in the baryonic velocity : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is taken to be imaginary .",
    "velocity divergence is then given by @xmath39      time evolution of the photon distribution function is governed by the boltzmann equation @xmath40 the left - hand side of the equation describes the free steaming of photons , and the collision term is on the right - hand side .",
    "to keep our analysis linear in small quantities , we ignore the last term on the left , which represents gravitational lensing , because both factors are of the first order in perturbations , making the entire term second order .",
    "therefore , our linearized collisionless equation is @xmath41 next , we evaluate different terms of this equation in the newtonian gauge .",
    "the second term on the right side includes the time change in the photon frequency due to the expansion of the universe and the relative motion of the baryons because the frequency in equations ( [ eq : boltzmanneq ] ) and ( [ eq : bolcollisionless ] ) is defined relative to the baryons , rather than to an observer fixed in newtonian coordinates .",
    "we ignore contributions of the time derivative of metric perturbation because the metric potential is negligible compared to the subhorizon perturbations in the baryons that we are considering in this analysis . , where @xmath42 is the metric potential . for subhorizon perturbation ,",
    "the wavenumber @xmath26 is much larger than @xmath43 , making @xmath42 negligible compared to perturbations in the baryons .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that the baryonic velocity is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "hence , we can neglect the gravitational redshift / blueshift because it is small compared to the redshift / blueshift due to peculiar motions of the baryons . ]",
    "the third term is proportional to the gradient of @xmath22 and the only contribution to that term comes from the perturbative part of the photon distribution function @xmath24 .",
    "the accompanying factor is just the velocity of photons in the direction of the @xmath30 axis , which is equal to @xmath45 .",
    "focusing for now only on the collisionless boltzmann equation , we set it equal to zero and get the following expression for the time evolution of the photon occupation number in the free - streaming ( collisionless ) case @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hubble parameter .    using the basic properties and recurrence relations of legendre polynomials , we find the expressions for each multipole order @xmath48 and its time derivative @xmath49 \\",

    "the resulting spectrum ( figure [ fig : bkg ] , left panel ) , normalized to the intensity of photons on the blue side far away from the line center , shows an asymmetric absorption feature around the ly@xmath0 frequency .",
    "the shape of the feature is determined by the photon drift and diffusion in frequency caused by the scattering off of hydrogen atoms .",
    "this suppression in the radiation spectrum remains fixed once a steady state has been reached ; it does not redshift away with the expansion of the universe , indicating energy transfer from the radiation field to the gas .    as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : bkg ] ,",
    "the absorption feature is deeper for the gas of higher mean density ( shown in blue dash - dotted line ) because the scattering rate increases if there are more hydrogen atoms present .",
    "the feature is shallower for the gas of higher mean temperature ( green dashed line ) because in that case the energy transferred via recoils makes a smaller fraction of the average kinetic energy of the atoms .",
    "similarly , the absorption feature is shallower for the case of non - zero atomic velocity divergence ( red dotted line ) , which can be thought of as a bulk contribution to the kinetic energy of atoms in addition to their thermal motion .",

    "@xcite calculated the ratio of temperature and density perturbations as a function of wavenumber @xmath26 at several redshifts , including @xmath142 , the epoch that we consider in this work .",
    "the ratio of @xmath36 and @xmath35 at @xmath142 is almost constant for small - scale perturbations , @xmath153 .",
    "we make use of this result to show ( figure [ fig : adpert ] ) the joint contribution of the density and temperature perturbations ( @xmath154 ) relative to the heating caused by the unperturbed background photons .",
    "we ignore perturbations in the velocity because the magnitude of @xmath155 is much smaller than that of @xmath151 or @xmath152 for most wavenumbers .    on large scales ( i.e. , small values of @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the heating caused by perturbations has the same sign as the mean effect : positive for the continuum photons and negative for the injected photons , which indicates a small increase in the gas heating by the continuum photons in regions of higher density and temperature due to the increased scattering rate .",
    "cooling by the injected photons in those regions will also increase .",
    "these additional contributions to the heating are very small .",
    "the values shown in figure [ fig : adpert ] , which are already a factor of @xmath156 smaller than the mean effect , need to be multiplied by the amplitude of density perturbations to give the actual relative heating . since our formalism is based on the linear perturbation theory , it is applicable to perturbations of the order of a few percent or smaller . hence , the additional heating at large scales can only make a few percent of the mean ( unperturbed ) ly@xmath0 heating .",
    "an interesting feature appears for perturbations on very small scales ( @xmath157  cmpc@xmath2 ) . for the case of the continuum photons , values of the relative heating , shown in figure [ fig : adpert ] ,",
    "turn from positive to negative . on length scales below that threshold , perturbations act in the opposite direction from the unperturbed effect",
    "; they reduce the heating of the gas in positively perturbed regions ( i.e. , regions of higher density and temperature than the mean ) .",
    "the opposite happens for cooler and underdense regions .",
    "the effect of the injected photons remains unchanged .",
    "hence , perturbations on scales smaller than that corresponding to @xmath157  cmpc@xmath2 will be damped due to the effect of thermal conduction by ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "this length scale , however , is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the jeans scale .    for gas of",
    "higher mean temperature , e.g. , with @xmath158  k , the result stays qualitatively the same , only the values of the relative heating , both the mean effect and the contribution of perturbations , are reduced .",
    "the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons produced by early generations of luminous objects can cause moderate heating of high - redshift igm .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons and hydrogen atoms exchange energy during scattering due to atomic recoil .",
    "details of radiative transfer are further complicated by the frequency diffusion of photons caused by scattering and the drift to lower frequencies due to hubble expansion . in the optically thick limit , the gas and the radiation field approach statistical equilibrium , which greatly reduces the energy exchange .",
    "taking into account all of these effects , an asymmetric absorption feature is created in the radiation spectrum around the ly@xmath0 frequency in the case of the continuum photons that redshift directly into ly@xmath0 from the blue side of the line .",
    "photons that redshift into higher resonances and then cascade into ly@xmath0 are called the injected photons .",
    "their spectrum has a shape of a modified step function around the ly@xmath0 frequency .",
    "scattering of the continuum photons causes heating of the igm proportional to the area of the absorption feature .",
    "this heating is higher for gas of lower mean temperature and higher density .",
    "the injected photons , on the other hand , cause cooling of the gas because they preferentially scatter off atoms moving in the opposite direction .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of ly@xmath0 scattering on high - redshift ( @xmath142 ) igm with linear perturbations in density , temperature , and velocity divergence .",
    "we are primarily interested in small - scale perturbations that can be affected by thermal conduction via ly@xmath0 photons . for perturbations with scales smaller than the ly@xmath0 diffusion length - scale",
    ", photons can diffuse into regions where they are further away from being in a statistical equilibrium with the gas , causing enhancement in the energy exchange . to find the exact scale",
    "at which this occurs , we solve radiative transfer equations numerically , using the fokker - planck approximation .",
    "we find that the scale at which this effect becomes relevant is very small , corresponding to a comoving wavenumber of @xmath157  mpc@xmath2 , which is a factor of @xmath159 smaller than the jeans scale . on larger scales , where structures in the igm are expected to be present ,",
    "the heating perturbations add a correction to the mean effect that is on the order of the amplitude of the density or temperature perturbation in the gas .",
    "since our formalism is based on the linear perturbation theory , this makes only a few percent difference to the gas heating in typical cases .",

    "equations for different multipoles of the perturbed radiation field are given by : @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 where @xmath26 is the physical wavenumber , not comoving .",
    "in the first equation , @xmath164 is used to denote the mean value of the diffusivity parameter . the full expression for this quantity , including perturbations , can be written as @xmath165 .",
    "to solve the above described system of equations , we truncate the series at @xmath166 by setting @xmath167 .",
    "the choice of the largest considered multipole could of course be different . in our analysis",
    ", we only use the solutions for the monopole and dipole terms , but we want to keep as many higher orders as possible to avoid introducing significant errors into the lowest multipoles by making an artificial truncation of the series too close to them . on the other hand ,",
    "tracking too many multipole orders becomes computationally challenging .",
    "we find that keeping nine multipoles is optimal : the computation can be done in a reasonable amount of time and increasing @xmath85 by one changes the resulting heating rate by @xmath168 at most ( in most cases much less than that ) .",
    "once we have a finite set of differential equations , we create an equidistant frequency grid containing a large number ( @xmath169 ) of frequencies centered at @xmath170 . the frequency range covered in our grid spans @xmath171  hz ( corresponding to @xmath172 ) on each side of the ly@xmath0 frequency .",
    "these numbers could have been chosen differently without significantly affecting the final result .",
    "for example , decreasing the frequency range by @xmath173 changes the computed heating rate by no more than @xmath174 . we can change the size of the frequency grid to test the convergence of our method . increasing the number of frequencies in the grid spanning the same frequency range to @xmath175 changes the result by @xmath176 or less .    in order to avoid numerical errors that can occur near the boundaries of the grid , in our calculations we do not take into account outer @xmath177 frequencies at both ends of the grid . as mentioned in section [ sec : hrate ] , to calculate the heating rate we use equations ( [ eq : hrcentermean ] ) and ( [ eq : hrcenterpert ] ) in the central part of the grid and equation ( [ eq : hrwings ] ) in the outer parts .",
    "the exact number of frequencies included in these outer parts , the so - called wings , does not significantly affect the result , as long as the central spectral features , contained within @xmath178 of the ly@xmath0 line center , are not included .",
    "the difference between having @xmath179 of frequencies in the wings and having @xmath180 is less than @xmath181 .    for the described grid of @xmath169 frequencies and with 9 multipoles , our system of equations forms a matrix of dimension @xmath182 .",
    "manipulating such a large matrix can be challenging . fortunately , most of the elements of this matrix are zero , hence we make use of scipy sparse matrix package ( scipy.sparse ) to construct the matrix and solve the sparse linear system .",
    "to approximate differentiation in the equations , we first used the central difference method @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the grid step .",
    "however , due to numerical oscillations that occurred near the end of the frequency grid , we introduced dissipation in the form of the forward difference contribution @xmath185 hence , the derivatives are given by a linear combination of the central and forward difference terms @xmath186 parameter @xmath187 describes the contribution of the forward difference method , and it changes linearly from zero at the center to unity at the ends of the frequency grid ."
