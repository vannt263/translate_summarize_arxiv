    "topological phases of matter play an important role , from quantum hall physics @xcite to the concept of symmetry protected topological phases @xcite .",

    "very recently , experimental realizations of the harper - hofstadter model @xcite were performed with ultracold atoms by using the laser - assisted tunneling technique @xcite , proposed for the first time in ref .  .",
    "at the same time , the possibility to generate artificial gauge fields was transferred into the domain of electromagnetic waves , giving opportunity to realize even more exotic photonic analogues of quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "few years later , such objects were realized experimentally using the lattice of ferrite rods @xcite and in a system of coupled optical - ring resonators @xcite . in a similar way , the artificial magnetic fields realisation of the effective haldane model @xcite , known as the model for the quantum anomalous hall effect , was done first by using the array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides with the propagation coordinate @xmath0 playing the role of time @xcite , and later in the system of shaken honeycomb optical lattice @xcite , following the first experimental realization of artificial graphene with cold atoms @xcite .",
    "this occurred in parallel to first observations of the quantum anomalous hall effect in quantum materials @xcite ( an overview on recent progress in this domain can be found in refs .  ) .",
    "another experiment with ultracold atoms in triangular flux lattice also succeeded in realizing ising - xy spin - models @xcite .",
    "recent experimental realization of floquet engineered bands in tunable honeycomb lattices with full momentum - resolved measurement of the berry curvature was also reported in ref .  .",
    "importantly , experimental realizations of artificial magnetic fields in cold atom systems and in photonic lattices are based on the application of a periodic time - dependent perturbation . in the case of a non - resonant coupling , the floquet theory",
    "is often used to solve the problem . according to the floquet theory @xcite",
    ", one expects that the dynamics of such systems in the high - frequency regime will be separated into the `` slow '' and `` fast '' parts .",
    "the slow dynamics will thus be simply described in terms of a time - independent effective ( floquet ) hamiltonian .",
    "generally , an exact expression of the effective ( floquet ) hamiltonian is not accessible and one should rely on approximations such as , for example , the magnus expansion @xcite or the high frequency expansion @xcite ( see refs .   for general review and comparison of the two approaches ) .",
    "these expansions are perturbative and their convergence is not ensured even in the relatively simple case of non - interacting systems . when interactions must be taken into account , the situation becomes even more complicated .",
    "behaviour of driven many - body systems was studied theoretically and numerically @xcite and the invalidity of the high frequency expansions was often related to the problem of heating in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , today a lot of interest is dedicated to `` floquet engineering ''  @xcite .",
    "more generally , it consists in generating an effective ( floquet ) hamiltonian with desired properties , starting from a more trivial one by superimposing a periodic time - dependent perturbation . using the floquet theory ( and",
    "the high - frequency expansion ) and a well chosen geometry allows to design targetted hamiltonians .",
    "many theoretical studies were done in order to investigate the possibility to obtain floquet topological ( chern ) insulators from irradiated graphene structures @xcite , that were recently observed experimentally @xcite . driven superconducting systems were considered in order to observe floquet majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "these works are in deep connection with the study of topological properties and corresponding topological invariants of periodically driven systems @xcite , showing that their topological structure is even richer then in the general classification at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "based on recent theoretical proposals @xcite and experimental realizations @xcite , in this work we investigate the possibility to simulate quantum anomalous hall effect for photons .",
    "we consider the model for bosons defined on the honeycomb lattice , with the hamiltonian comprising the term of periodically modulated nearest neighbor hoppings . in the high frequency regime",
    ", the time - dependent term does not contribute in average , but creates effective hoppings between next nearest neighbours with purely imaginary amplitudes , leading to the generation of an anisotropic version of the haldane model .",
    "we check the validity of the high frequency expansion by performing numerical comparison of the time - evolution with exact and effective hamiltonians and we infer the regime of consistency between the two hamiltonians .",
    "in the case of cold atoms systems ( or also exotic polariton superfluids @xcite and photonic becs @xcite ) , the generation of the haldane model , reported in refs .  , allows one to investigate the rich properties of lattice bosons subjected to artificial gauge fields as performed in 1d @xcite and ladder @xcite systems and on triangular lattices @xcite .",
    "it is known that this can give rise to the condensation phenomenon of bosons at non - zero momentum @xcite .",
    "this effect is similar to the fflo phase @xcite , and can be realized by working only with s - wave bands of the optical lattice .",
    "recently , square lattice realization of this effect was performed on a 2d lattice @xcite .",
    "finite momentum bec was predicted @xcite and observed with p - wave band superfluids @xcite .",
    "related experimental works were also performed recently , based on a near - resonant hybridization of s- and p - bands of bosons @xcite . in this paper , we show that the configuration of artificial magnetic fields , appearing in the effective anisotropic haldane model for bosons in s - wave bands , also supports the finite momentum phase with two - well structure , and that the transition between the zero momentum and the finite momentum phase is of second order , in contrast to the isotropic situation where chiral currents show a discontinuity at the phase transition @xcite .",
    "we show moreover that the nature of this transition changes in the ladder analogue of the model , giving rise to the apparition of flat bands .",
    "the role of interactions in the ladder geometry far from the flat band region is then studied using bosonization @xcite , in relation with current experimental developments @xcite .",

    "it was also successfully implemented using superconducting qubits arranged in a triangular loop with pairwise couplings @xcite , based on earlier theoretical suggestions @xcite . in the following sections we will show that this approach can be used to generate the model for quantum anomalous hall effect .",
    "similar systems were also experimentally realized with ultracold atoms , by using the lattice shaking @xcite or laser assisted tunneling techniques @xcite .",
    "related theoretical proposal was considered in ref .  .",
    "photon - assisted tunneling was also suggested to generate artificial magnetic fields in ref .  .",
    "in these cases we should however think of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as of chemical potentials on two sublattices .",

    "such interactions can originate from the _ s_-wave collisions between atoms .",
    "an experimental realization of the bose - hubbard model can also be achieved in photonic lattices in the highly detuned limit , with an ( approximately exact ) mapping between the jaynes - cummings lattice model and the bose - hubbard model .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to considerate weak to moderate interaction effects and understand the emergent quantum phase transition from the uniform bec to the fflo - type bec almost in a single - particle manner .",
    "interaction effects will also be discussed using ed ( for a small number of particles ) and using a ginzburg - landau approach ( for an infinite number of particles ) . in an analogue ladder geometry",
    ", the effect of interactions will be captured using the haldane representation of bosons @xcite , which is reminiscent of the gross - pitaevski representation in the two dimensional system .",
    "the main difference will be the nature of the quantum phase transition : in the ladder system , there will be the occurrence of flat bands in the energy spectrum in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition .",

    ", one can expect that the dynamics of such systems in the high - frequency regime will be separated into the `` slow '' and `` fast '' parts . from the point of view of states in the hilbert space , this means that each eigenstate @xmath23 of the hamiltonian @xmath21 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are floquet states ( analogues of bloch states in the time - space ) verifying @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 are called floquet quasienergies .",
    "this decomposition can be used to write the expression of the evolution operator : @xmath28 the `` fast '' intra - periodic sub - motions of the system are described by the term @xmath29 , that are often associated with `` kick '' operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the `` slow '' long - time dynamics is due to the term @xmath32 , that can also be interpreted as the evolution under some static effective ( floquet ) hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to the following rewriting : @xmath34    in general case one can not deduce an exact expression of the effective ( floquet ) hamiltonian and should rely on approximations such as , for example , the magnus expansion ( me ) @xcite or the high frequency expansion ( hfe ) @xcite ( see refs .   for general reviews and comparison of these two approaches ) .",
