    "<S> such a dephasing process depends sensitively on the self - interaction strength @xmath82 and the polar angle @xmath62 of the initial css ; while the detuning @xmath31 and the azimuth angle @xmath83 gives _ vanishing _ contribution to the coherence .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we check the validity of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cma ] ) by comparing it with the exact result of @xmath64 [ where @xmath91 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cm ] ) ] , and find both results fit with each other . for symmetric bec with @xmath2 , we have @xmath92 and atom number variance @xmath93 ; while for @xmath1 , the variance ( width ) becomes narrow , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> thus , the short - time solution of the coherence reads @xmath105 </S>",
    "<S> \\equiv \\exp \\left [ -\\left ( t / t_{d}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] , \\label{imamoglu}\\]]with characteristic time scale of the phase diffusion @xmath106obviously , the phase - diffusion time @xmath57 for the initial css with @xmath4 @xcite ; while for @xmath107 , our results show that the diffusion becomes slowly due to an enhanced factor @xmath108 in the phase - diffusion rate [ see also fig .  [ fig3 ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> the revival of the coherence occurring later at a time @xmath109 @xcite is observable in real experiment , such as @xmath110 microsecond for nonlinearity @xmath111 hz and particle number @xmath112 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that similar results of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j+ ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j+a ] ) have been obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . however , the authors focused on the increase of the diffusion time as @xmath113 , but not @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we emphasis that for negative @xmath115 the so - called phase separation may take place due to dynamically unstable of the becs @xcite . both the phase diffusion and the phase separation reduce the ramsey fringes visibility ( i.e. , the first - order coherence @xmath72 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the latter effect results from dynamics of spatial degree - of - freedom , rather than that of the internal states considered here .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated phase diffusion of two - component bec for arbitrary initial css . </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically that for the css with @xmath116 , the diffusion process is suppressed due to the reduced atom number variance @xmath117 below the standard quantum limit @xmath118 [ see also eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ variance ] ) and ( [ diffusion time ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic results are based upon the sma , which works well to describe the condensates tightly confined in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) trapping potential . for a lower dimensional cases </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the coherence @xmath72 [ or the fringe visibility ] is expected to decay more quickly due to the whole continuum of excitation modes in confined degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>"
