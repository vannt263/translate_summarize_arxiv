    "the quantity known as _ fidelity _ naturally appears in the field of quantum information science as a way of determining the reliability of a given protocol for quantum information transfer : the similarity between input @xmath0 and output @xmath1 states can be quantified by simply computing the absolute value of the overlap between them , @xmath2 .",
    "recently , after the pioneering work @xcite of zanardi and paunkovi ' c , and following the broader trend of cross - fertilization between the fields of quantum information science and condensed matter physics,@xcite a number of studies have extended the scope of applicability of the concept of fidelity to the study of quantum critical phenomena ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "the basic idea behind this so - called _ fidelity approach _ is simple .",
    "we consider a general many - body hamiltonian @xmath3 with ground - state @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath4 undergoes major changes in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xmath6 , we expect a sharp drop in the fidelity , @xmath7 for small ( @xmath8 ) variations in @xmath9 close to @xmath6",
    ". therefore , by investigating the behavior of @xmath10 when couplings in the hamiltonian are varied , one should be able to detect quantum criticality . besides its novelty , this approach is purely quantum geometrical@xcite and therefore has the appeal that no _ a priori _ identification of order parameters is required .",
    "the concept of _ fidelity susceptibility_@xcite @xmath11 naturally appears as the fidelity s leading term in the limit @xmath8 , @xmath12 ( the linear term in @xmath13 in the above expansion vanishes due to normalization of the wave - function  alternatively it can be seen to arise from the fact that @xmath10 is maximum at @xmath14 for any value of @xmath9 . )",
    "the aforementioned drop in @xmath10 close to a qcp is thus associated to a divergence in @xmath15 and the latter quantity may also be employed in the study of quantum phase transitions .",
    "the situation here is reminiscent of the use of the specific heat to detect _ thermal _ phase transitions : while the presence of singularities in the specific heat for varying temperatures signals the location of finite - temperature critical points , @xmath11 is a system s response to changes in the coupling constant @xmath9 , whose divergencies are associated to the occurrence of _ quantum _ phase transitions .",
    "although obviously some information is lost in going from @xmath10 to @xmath16 , and for instance it is currently not clear whether transitions of order higher than second can be detected by studying the latter , focusing on @xmath16 has up to now proved to be a fruitful strategy .",
    "the main reason behind this is that it is possible to show@xcite that @xmath11 is closely related to more conventional physical quantities , such as imaginary - time dynamical responses .",
    "this is particularly advantageous since it allows one to rely on well established concepts and techniques from theoretical condensed - matter physics in order to draw conclusions on the properties of @xmath16 .",
    "we follow this line of reasoning in this paper , in a twofold way",
    ".    first , we present the details of a recently introduced@xcite quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) scheme that allows for the evaluation of @xmath15 for a large class of sign - problem - free models .",
    "this constitutes an important advance as the group of problems that can be studied within the fidelity approach is considerably enlarged , and additionally one benefits from the computational power of qmc methods . in particular , high - precision scaling analysis for models in dimensions higher than one is now possible : previous computations of @xmath15 for two - dimensional systems have relied on exact diagonalization ( ed ) techniques and were restricted to small system sizes , something that precludes a precise determination of scaling dimensions in the vicinity of a qcp .",
    "second , by building upon the aforementioned relationship between @xmath17 and response functions , we determine the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility close to a qcp .",
    "the divergence of @xmath11 at @xmath18 is shown to be related to the critical exponent @xmath19 describing the divergence of the correlation length . in this way , and supported by the results obtained from the qmc simulations , we assess the validity of other scaling analysis for the divergence of @xmath15 that have recently appeared in the litterature .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we also analyze the properties of the ground - state energy s second derivative , @xmath20 .",
    "this quantity is closely related to the fidelity susceptibility@xcite and , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , scales in a way related to the scaling of @xmath17 in the quantum critical regime . since the computation of @xmath20 within qmc is much more efficient than that of @xmath15 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sse_d2e0 ] , it is important to address the question of which of these quantities is best suited to the study of second - order quantum phase transitions and of whether the current interest around the concept of fidelity susceptibility is justified on practical grounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after reviewing basic concepts in the fidelity approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] , we analyze an extension of the concept of fidelity susceptibility to finite temperatures ( a prerequisite for path - integral qmc simulations ) and relate it to a more commonly employed metric for thermal states in sec .",

    "it is also instructive to consider the ground - state energy s second - derivative , whose intimate relation to @xmath34 has been pointed out in refs .   and .",
    "motivated by this close relationship , we define @xmath35 and , by using the eigenbasis of @xmath24 , it is readily shown that @xmath36 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g_omega ] ) and ( [ eq : d2_e0 ] ) it is straightforward to see that @xmath37 we can notice that the only important difference between eqs .",

    "an important subtlety is apparent here : notice that the upper integration limit in the above expression is @xmath45 , instead of @xmath46 .",
