    "the majority of galaxies in the universe are low - luminosity , have masses of @xmath0@xmath6 solar masses , and are known as dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "galaxies form hierarchically through numerous mergers of smaller counterparts @xcite , whose properties will inevitably influence their parent galaxy .",
    "dwarf galaxies are the smallest galactic building blocks , and this leads to the question on even smaller scales : how were dwarf galaxies influenced by their progenitors ?",
    "a subset of dwarf galaxies , dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) , have the highest mass - to - light ratios @xcite and contain a population of metal - poor stars that are similar to galactic halo stars @xcite .",
    "there is a metallicity floor exists of @xmath7 and @xmath8 of solar metallicity in dsph and halo stars , respectively @xcite .",
    "stellar metallicities increase with time as previous stars continually enrich the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "hence the lowest metallicity stars are some of the oldest stars in the system and can shed light on the initial formation of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this metallicity floor also suggests that metal enrichment was widespread in dark matter halos before low - mass stars could have formed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "supernovae ( sne ) from metal - free ( pop iii ) stars generate the first metals in the universe and may supply the necessary metallicity to form the most metal - poor stars observed @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxy formation can be further constrained with observations that probe reionization and semi - analytic models .",
    "observations of luminous quasars powered by supermassive black holes ( smbh ) of mass @xmath0@xmath9 @xcite and low - luminosity galaxies @xcite at and above redshift 6 indicate that active star and bh formation began long before this epoch .",
    "semi - analytic models have argued that cosmological reionization was largely caused by low - luminosity dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "some of the most relevant parameters in these models control star formation rates , ionizing photon escape fractions , metal enrichment , and the minimum mass of a star forming halos .",
    "they are usually constrained using ( i ) the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization observation from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) that measures the optical depth of electron scattering to the cmb @xcite , ( ii ) gunn - peterson troughs in @xmath10 quasars , and ( iii ) numerical simulations that examine negative and positive feedback of radiation backgrounds @xcite .",
    "radiation hydrodynamical _ ab initio _ simulations of the first stars @xcite and galaxies can further constrain the parameters used in semi - analytic models by analyzing the impact of stellar feedback on star formation rates and the propagation of regions in the early universe . moreover , these simulations contain a wealth of information pertaining to the properties of pop iii star forming halos and early dwarf galaxies that can increase our understanding of the first stages of galaxy formation .",
    "first we need to consider pop iii stars , which form in the progenitor halos of the first galaxies , to capture the initial properties of dwarf galaxies .",
    "cosmological numerical studies have shown that massive ( 30300 ) pop iii stars form in dark matter halos with masses @xmath0@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite followed the gaseous collapse of a molecular cloud that will host a pop iii star to cosmologically high number densities of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the former group thoroughly analyzed the gas dynamics , cooling , and stability of this free - fall collapse .",
    "the latter group observed a protostellar core forming with 10 jupiter masses that is bounded by a highly asymmetric protostellar shock .",
    "both groups found no fragmentation in the fully molecular core that collapses into a single , massive @xmath0100  star .",
    "furthermore , @xcite determined that accretion may halt at the same mass scale , using protostellar models even for different mass accretion histories .    pop iii stars with stellar masses roughly between 140 and 260  end their life in a pair - instability sn ( pisn ) that releases @xmath13 ergs of energy and tens of solar masses of heavy elements into the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "these explosions are an order of magnitude larger than typical type ii sne in both quantities @xcite , such explosions energies are larger than the binding energies in their low - mass hosts , e.g. , @xmath14 ergs for a @xmath1 halo at redshift 20 .",
    "thus gas structures in the host halo are totally disrupted and expelled , effectively enriching the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) with the sn ejecta @xcite .",
    "the combination of the shallow potential well and large explosion energy suggests that these events are good candidates for enriching the first galaxies and igm . outside of the pair - instability mass range ,",
    "pop iii stars die by directly collapsing into a bh @xcite , possibly providing the seeds of high - redshift quasars in galaxies that are associated with the rarest density fluctuations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one - dimensional calculations @xcite and recent three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations @xcite have investigated how the pop iii stellar feedback affects its host halo and nearby cosmic structure .",
    "in addition to sne , regions surrounding pop iii stars , which have luminosities @xmath0@xmath15 @xcite , alone can dynamically affect gas at distances up to a few proper kpc .",
    "ionization fronts and regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) have been extensively studied in literature on star formation since @xcite .",
    "stellar radiation generates an ionization front that begins as a r - type front and transforms into a d - type front when its speed slows to twice the sound speed of the ionized gas .",
    "then a strong shock wave forms at the front and recedes from the star at @xmath0@xmath16 .",
    "the ionization front decouples from the shock wave and creates a final region that is 1  3 proper kpc in radius for massive pop iii stars residing in low - mass halos .",
    "the ionized gas is warm ( @xmath0@xmath17 k ) and diffuse ( @xmath0@xmath18 ) .",
    "the shock wave continues to accumulate gas and advance after the star dies .",
    "eventually it stalls in the igm , but in the process , it reduces the baryon fraction of the halo below one percent @xcite .    clearly the number of progenitors of a given galaxy as well as the star formation and feedback history of the progenitors will play a role in shaping all of its properties . but how much ?",
    "if most stars of a galaxy are formed later , will the earliest episodes not be entirely negligible ? to start addressing these questions , we have carried out a suite of simulations that include accurate three dimensional radiative transfer and the sn explosions of pop iii stars and have followed the buildup of several dwarf galaxies from those pop iii star hosting progenitors .",
    "the pop iii radiative and sn feedback dramatically alter the properties of high redshift dwarf galaxies , and we discuss some of the most striking differences here .",
    "we leave a more detailed exposition of star formation rates , star forming environments , and the beginning of cosmic reionization for a later paper .    in the following section",
