    "the study of acoustomagnetoelectric effect ( ame ) in semiconductors and its related materials have generated lot of interest recently .",
    "ame in materials such as superlattices @xcite , quantum wires @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite deals with appearance of a d.c electric field in the hall direction when the sample is on open circuit .",
    "studies have shown that the propagation of acoustic waves causes the transfer of energy and momentum to the conducting electrons @xcite .",
    "when the build up of the acoustic flux exceeds the velocity of sound it causes the formation and propagation of acoustoelectric field @xcite .",
    "other effects such as acoustoelectric effect ( ae ) @xcite , acoustothermal effect @xcite , and acoustoconcentration effect can occur .",
    "the ae was predicted by grinberg and kramer @xcite for bipolar semiconductors and experimentally observed in bismuth by yamada @xcite . by applying the sound flux ( @xmath11 ) , electric current ( @xmath12 ) , and magnetic fields ( @xmath13 ) perpendicularly to the sample , it is interesting to note that , with the sample opened in direction perpendicular to the hall direction , can leads to a non - zero acoustomagnetoelectric effect ame @xcite .",

    "al @xcite studied these effect in superlattice in the hypersound regime , bau et .",
    "@xcite studied the ame of cylindrical quantum wires .",
    "also , ame effect in mono - polar semiconductor for both weak and quantizing field were studied @xcite .",
    "experimentally , ame has been observed in n - insb @xcite , and in graphite @xcite for @xmath14 . in this paper , ame in graphene nanoribbon",
    "is studied .",
    "there are differences between graphene and graphite .",
    "graphene@xcite is a single layer of carbon atoms with zero band - gap . within the low energy range ( @xmath15 ) , carriers in graphenes are massless relativistic particles with effective speed of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 being the fermi velocity ) .",
    "one of the major limitations of graphene sheet is lack of band gap in its energy spectrum  @xcite . to overcome this ,",
    "stripes of graphene called graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) whose characteristics are dominated by the nature of their edges ( the armchair ( agnrs ) and zigzag ( zgnrs ) ) with well - defined width are proposed @xcite . by patterning graphene into narrow ribbons",
    "creates an energy gap where gnr behaves like semiconductor @xcite .",
    "however , graphite ( bunch of graphene ) have planar structures with a semimetallic behaviour having a band overlap of about @xmath18 .",
    "its thermal , acoustic and electronic properties are highly anisotropic , which means that phonons travel much easily along the planes than they do through the planes  @xcite .",
    "graphene therefore have a very high electron mobility thus offers a much better level of electronic conduction . in this paper ,",
    "the boltzmann kinetic equation is used to study the same in gnr .",
    "this is achieved by applying sound flux ( @xmath11 ) to the gnr sample in the presence of electric field ( @xmath19 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath13 ) . with the sample open ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "give the @xmath21 in gnr .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , the theory of same in gnrs is outlined . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical calculations are presented ; and while section 4 deals with the conclusion .",
