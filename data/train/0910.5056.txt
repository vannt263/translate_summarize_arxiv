    "first , the converged density matrix of isolated cluster based dft calculation is applied as the initial guess .",

    "since gto basis functions are originally denoted in real space , to calculate the band structure of an infinite 1d bulk crystal , one need to transform the fock and overlap matrices to reciprocal space , @xmath48    where @xmath49 denotes the dft fock operator of a unit cell of the quasi-1d crystal , and @xmath50 is its matrix element in bloch wave representation with @xmath51 standing for the coupling fock matrix element between lattice @xmath52 and @xmath53 in real - space .",
    "theoretically , the summation in eq.([fmnk ] ) goes over all lattices in real - space ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "however , under tb approximation , the summation in eq.([fmnk ] ) has only three terms considered , including the on - site hamiltonian @xmath55 and the nearest neighbor coupling hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57    and @xmath58 is calculated likewise    @xmath59     applying gamess(us ) combined with negf subroutines , we first carry out the dft - negf calculation of the 4-zgnr junction ( fig.[alignment ] ) under zero source - drain bias .",
    "then , real - space matrices @xmath14 , @xmath60 , @xmath33 , and @xmath61 are extracted from the converged result .",
    "substituting @xmath55 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 in eq.(tbfmnk , [ tbsmnk ] ) with the extracted matrices respectively , tb band structure @xmath47 of quasi-1d 4-zgnr can be obtained by solving roothaan equation@xmath65    we obtained a spin - polarized zero temperature ground state on 4-zgnr with spin dependent dft - lsda calculation , where the energy of the spin - polarized state is about 20 mev per edge atom lower than the spin - unpolarized one , similar to the results obtained by son _",
    "et al_.@xcite however , the magnetic order of zgnr is reported to be unstable in the presence of ballistic tunneling current under room temperature.@xcite thus , we present a zgnr device simulation under room temperature with spin - unpolarized calculation in this work .",
    "first , we apply negf - dft calculation to the optimized structure of the perfect quazi-1d 4-zgnr , where two central unit cells including 32 carbon atoms are treated as the scattering region between the contact layers and periodic zgnr electrodes ( fig.[alignment ] ) . pbc calculation of the system is also performed by gaussian03 with exactly the same basis functions and dft calculation setup ( cep-4 g and b3pw91 ) to check the validity of our tb approximation .    in fig.[band](a ) , the 4-zgnr s pbc band structure provided by gaussian03 exhibits its semiconductor properties with a band gap of @xmath66 ev , while the dft - based tb band structure for the same system is presented in fig.band(b ) for comparison . here , @xmath41 ( @xmath67",
    "ev ) is at the center of the band gap of 4-zgnr .",
    "the result plotted is a so called `` folded version '' because the unit cell is enlarged to include two armchair carbon layers . comparing fig.[band](a ) and ( b ) , the dft - based tb band structure ( b ) corresponds with the pbc result ( a ) perfectly , indicating that although only @xmath68 and @xmath69 are included in the calculation , tb approximation can still accurately predict the bulk property of 4-zgnr : almost all the interactions out of tb range are neglectable .",
    "the semiconducting property of 4-zgnr originates from two factors .",
    "in addition to the transverse quantum confinement of the extremely narrow 4-zgnr ( about @xmath70 nm wide ) , the broken perfect honeycomb structure near the gnr edges opens the gap on the band structure . as presented in fig.[unit cell ] , the edged c - c bond lengths of 4-zgnr are no longer identical to the ones in the perfect honeycomb structure , and the bond angles deviate from @xmath71 after structure relaxation .",
    "the reconfiguration of structure breaks the perfect hexagon symmetry , which generates the band gap between @xmath72 and @xmath72 * states .",
    "the semiconducting property of 4-zgnr has its disadvantage because of the poor conductance under low bias .",
    "however , the c - c bonds between the leads and the scattering region are very strong , which avoids the uncontrollable contact diversity on the interface between organic molecules and metal leads .",
    "our further calculation indicates that , with the increase in the width of zgnr , the gap gradually vanishes , and the unworking region of zgnr will be reduced .",
    "the width of gnr  realized in experiments are rarely smaller than @xmath6 nm nowadays , which is much wider than the 4-zgnr considered in this work , making zgnrs suitable to be applied as lead material in realistic nanoscale circuits .",
    "however , the negf - dft simulation of a @xmath6 nm zgnr is extremely time consuming and requires enormous computational resources . in this work",
    ", we are not trying to reproduce an actual experimental situation , but to demonstrate theoretically the relationship between the band structure and the transmission spectrum for a simple 4-zgnr system , and to propose the mechanism that might control the transport behavior of zgnr devices .",
    "the transmission spectrum @xmath46 calculated under zero bias is shown in fig.[band](c ) with several integer steps and narrow jump points , which is consistent with the band structures made by our dft - based tb ( b ) or g03 pbc ( a ) calculations .",
    "this is the usual characteristics of the transmission spectrum for infinite lead .",
    "similar appearances were reported by other works for the study of quazi-1d systems.@xcite    in such a perfect 1d crystal without any defects , each bloch state can tunnel through the junction without any classical resistance , and contribute a unit of quantum conductance for the total transmission spectrum .",
    "the integer steps in the transmission spectrum indicate the number of the conducting channels or bloch states . for the electrons with energy",
    "closely higher than @xmath73 ev , where cross three @xmath47 curves , three bloch states function as conducting channels , so the transmission spectrum is @xmath74 around this energy value . in another case , the band structure @xmath47 crosses the energy of @xmath75 ev four times , so that the transmission here is @xmath8 . in this regime , for any energy value under consideration , one can accurately predict the transmission coefficient for the perfect quasi-@xmath70d crystal simply by counting the number of bloch state in the electronic structure .",
    "the narrow `` jump points '' in transmission spectrum ( fig.[band](c ) ) are labeled from @xmath70 to @xmath76 .",
    "they are not caused by numerical inaccuracy , but induced by the sudden change in the number of the conduction channels . in fig.[band](d ) we enlarge the band structure around the points to show that there are mini - gaps rather than band crossings corresponding to the transmission abnormal points . investigating carefully , one may find that the number of bloch states changes from one to two then zero when the relevant energy scan up across the maximum of the band then entering the mini - gap ( point @xmath77 ) , which causes the transmission value varied from one to two then zero .",
    "the sudden vanishment of two bloch states inside the narrow band gap of @xmath78 ev explains the sharp drop of two quantum conductance units in the transmission function at point @xmath70 .",
    "the jump points @xmath0 , @xmath74 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are all companied by the small band gaps on @xmath82 or x points , generating a decline of one quantum conductance unit in the transmission function at the relevant energy values due to the absence of one bloch state .",
    "interestingly , the runtish point @xmath83 fails to achieve an integer drop .",
    "its exotic behavior is caused by the tiny mini - gap of @xmath84 ev , which is very hard to demonstrate by the transmission function with the numerical sampling step length as large as @xmath85 ev .",
    "fortunately , tunneling current is evaluated by the integral of transmission spectrum , and the numerical error like point @xmath83 does not influence the result significantly even if the error is included in the bias window .",
    "it should be pointed out that although not shown here , all other crossings in the tb band structure are also investigated in details , with @xmath7 sampling k points from @xmath82 to x. no band gaps can be observed at the energy values where no abnormality exists on transmission function , demonstrating a very accurate matching between dft - negf calculated transmission and the dft - tb band structure .",
    "this matching assures the validity of the sgf of left ( right ) electrode , which is obtained by the dft - tb calculation .    in order to investigate the external electrostatic field response in 4-zgnr , homogeneous transverse electric fields",
    "are applied to the scattering region .",
    "the orientation of external field is arranged perpendicularly to the gnr axis ( shown in fig.[pure ] ) , with the intensity of @xmath86 v /   ( @xmath87 a.u . ) . by the help of macmolplt,@xcite 3d homo lumo and 2d molecular electrostatic potential ( mep ) distribution of pure 4-zgnr",
    "are presented in fig.[pure ] with the 2d plotting major plane parallel to the zgnr and @xmath88   away from it .",
    "the flat surface of 2d mep map is specifically chosen to reveal the electrostatic potential contributed by the @xmath72 and @xmath89 hybridized orbitals , which are mainly formed by the overlap of @xmath90 orbital of carbon atoms .",
    "the red contours are positive potential isolines , while the blue ones are negtive .",
    "we note that the mep plot is generated based on the optimized orbitals and occupations computed by gamess in the presence of the external field , subttracting the contribution of the external field itself .",
    "similar to previous works , homo and lumo are equally distributed on edges , and the magnitude of electron wave function decays from edge to the center gradually.@xcite under external fields , the molecular orbitals of @xmath72 and @xmath89 are splitted as the consequence of electric polarization : homo concentrated at the low - potential edge , while lumo at the high - potental edge .",
    "unfortunately , the transmission function of pure zgnr ( not shown here ) hardly responds to external fields : the fields can only control the orbital coupling in the direction perpendicular to the tunneling current .",
    "in recent first - principle calculations , some groups indicate that vacancies on gnr edges are energetically preferred@xcite , which significantly suppresses gnrs conductance.@xcite here , we fabricate gnr edge defects by removing three carbon atoms from the edges of 4-zgnr , with the dangling bonds saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "the central junction structure including 58 carbon atoms is optimized with the left and right leads fixed in their pbc optimized positions .",
    "the contact layers are kept out of the tb range from the central defect region , so that their `` bulk '' properties are protected by the buffer layers .",
    "optimization result indicates that , all carbon and hydrogen atoms in the defect region are still in the same plane after relaxation , and the saturating hydrogen atoms pushes the edge carbon atoms off the vacancy significantly .",
    "the equilibrium transmission spectrum of the edge defect junction is presented in fig.tf with the external field @xmath91 adjusted from @xmath52 to @xmath92 v /   ( @xmath93 a.u . ) .",
    "polarization effect stimulated by the transverse external fields for the homo and lumo distribution is shown in fig.[dfct plrztn ] respectively .",
    "similar to reported results , the gnr defect junction exhibits about 50% decline of transmission around @xmath41 under zero external fields .",
    "this drastic conductance depression is obvious because pure zgnr s homo and lumo are mainly distributed on edges so that their orbital coupling in the tunneling direction is significantly suppressed with edge defects presented . as plotted in fig.[dfct plrztn ] , edge vacancies break two of the six - sided carbon rings , and the c - c _ _ sp__@xmath94 hybridization of @xmath72 and @xmath89 mo is substituted by the localized c - h bonds on the edge vacancy , leading to a radical disruption of the delocalized conjugated system .",
    "although the conductance of defect junction is no better than pure zgnr , the presence of edge defects makes it more sensitive to the modulation of external transverse electric fields , which leads the possible application of the defect zgnr junctions to nanoscale electronic engineering . the i - v curve of the defect junction given by eq.([cur ] )",
    "is presented in fig.[i - v ] , in which a very clear depression of tunneling current can be observed under large transverse external fields . in this calculation , the temperature of fermi distribution is set at room temperature ( @xmath95k ) .",
    "the low conductance under the voltage @xmath96 v is caused by the homo - lumo gap of 4-zgnr .",
    "the tunneling current increases considerably with applied bias exceeding the gap threshold . in the presence of external fields",
    ", the junction almost turns off the conducting channel when @xmath91 exceeds @xmath97 v /  , exhibiting the maximum of the on / off ratio up to @xmath7 .",
    "similar with the situation of pure zgnr , lumo and homo of the defect junction are no longer symmetrically distributed when @xmath91 is applied .",
    "homo ( electron states ) and lumo ( hole states ) are polarized to opposite edges.(fig.dfct plrztn ) contrasting to pure 4-zgnr , electric polarization depresses the local orbital coupling of the central region to the gnr electrode much more severely as a consequence of the edge vacancies , producing significant difficulties for electrons to tunnel through the junction . to present a clearer mechanism of the conductance decay induced by electric polarization , mep map of the junction s scattering region",
    "is plotted in fig.[isoline ] with the potential of external field subtracted off .",
    "the isoline circles in the mep indicate charge concentration induced by polarization , with positive charge conglomerated on the upper edge , and the negative one on the opposite .",
    "functioning together with the geometry shape , tunable external fields splits the electron wave function with a potential barrier constructed on the edge vacancies , reflecting the carriers back to the electrodes .",
    "since no structural modification is required in the control process , conductance manipulation based on electric polarization is more sensitive to external stimulus , so gnr edge defect junctions have the potential to be applied as switching devices with considerable responding frequencies under the control of transverse electric fields . on the other hand , for a pure 4-zgnr without any vacancy , although polarization exits , the potential barrier can not be established , hence the tunneling current barely responds to @xmath91 sensitively .",
    "in summary , we use dft - negf method to simulate the transport properties of 4-zgnr , and find out that edge defects make the tunneling current of zgnr junctions more controllable by the transverse external electrostatic fields . in this work ,",
    "zgnr electrodes are modeled with dft - based tb approximation , and the validity of the approximation is assured by comparison between the perfect zgnr band structures calculated under our dft - based tb and gaussian03 pbc calculations .",
    "using dft - based tb method , we obtain the transmission function of the perfect zgnr system , of which the integer steps and jump points are explained well by the band structure .",
    "electronic devices made from the edge defect zgnr junctions have the advantage of easy control through the transverse electrostatic fields .",
    "the study of small and narrow gnr devices benefits graphene integrated circuit engineering that might be realized by ultra fine gnr fabrication technologies in the future .",
