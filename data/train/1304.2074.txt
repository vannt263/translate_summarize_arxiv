    "due to the remarkable growth of the credit derivatives market , the interest in corporate claim value models and risk structure has recently increased .",
    "financial distress tends to be an important factor in many corporate decisions .",
    "the two main sources of financial distress are corporate illiquidity and insolvency . in his paper @xcite",
    ", gryglewicz explains how changes in solvency affect liquidity and also how liquidity concerns affect solvency via capital structure choice .",
    "corporate solvency is the ability to cover debt obligations in the long run .",
    "uncertainty about average future profitability , with financial leverage , generates solvency concerns",
    ". corporate insolvency may lead to corporate reorganization or to bankruptcy of the firm in the worst case .",
    "corporate bankruptcy is central to the theory of the firm .",
    "a firm is generally considered bankrupt when it can not meet a current payment on a debt obligation . in this event ,",
    "the equity holders lose all claims on the firm , and the remaining loss which is the difference between the face value of the fixed claims and the market value of the firm , is supported by the debt holders . in the literature of corporate finance , merton @xcite appears to be the main pioneers in the derivation of formulas for corporate claims .",
    "this model is a dual of black and scholes model @xcite for stock price .",
    "merton @xcite further analyzed the risk structure of interest rates .",
    "more specifically , he found the relation between corporate bond spreads and government bond , and attempted to determine a valid measure of risk .",
    "he also developed the deterministc partial differential equation modelling the debt and equity of the firm .",
    "the assumption of constant volatility in the original black - scholes and merton models from which most claims derivations are inspired , is incompatible with derivatives prices observed in the market ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . for stock price ,",
    "two alternative theories are mostly used to overcome the constant volatility drawback .",
    "the first approach sometime called level - dependent volatility describes the stock price as a diffusion with level dependent volatility @xcite .",
    "the second approach sometime called stochastic volatility defines the volatility as an autonomous diffusion driven by a second brownian motion .    in @xcite , a new class of nonconstant volatility model which can be extended to include the first of the above approaches , that we called delayed model is introduced and further study in @xcite for options prices .",
    "this model shows that the past dependence of the stock price process is an important feature and therefore should not be ignored .",
    "the main goal of this model is to make volatility self  reinforcing .",
    "since the volatility is defined in terms of past behavior of the asset price , the self  reinforcing is high , precisely when there have been large movements in the recent past ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is designed to reflect real  world perceptions of market volatility , particularly if practitioners are to compare historic volatility with implied .",
    "following the duality between the stock price @xcite and corporate finance @xcite , we have recently introduced in @xcite the nonlinear delayed model in debt and guarantee . using self - financed strategy and replication",
    "we established that debt value and equity value follow two similar random partial differential equations ( rpdes ) within the last delay period interval .",
    "the analytical solution of our nonlinear model and rpdes are unknown in general case and therefore numerical techniques are needed .    in recent years",
    ", the computational complexity of mathematical models employed in financial mathematics has witnessed a tremendous growth ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the aims of this paper is to solve numerically our delayed nonlinear model for firm market value along with the corresponding rpdes , using real data from firms .",
    "comparison will be done with classical merton model . to the best of our knowledge",
    "such comparison has not yet been done in the financial literature .",
    "two major comparisons will be preformed : the market value of each corporate and its equity value ( or its debt value ) .",
    "we will first approximate the volatility of each corporate , afterward solve numerically our nonlinear model for the market value of the corporate along with the corresponding merton model using the @xmath0 semi implicit euler maruyama scheme to obtain sample numerical solutions .",
    "monte carlo method will be thereafter used to approximate the mean numerical solution of each model .",
    "the meam numerical value from each model ( our nonlinear model and merton model ) will be therefore compared with the real market value ( @xmath1 ) of the corporate . for debt value ( or equity value ) solutions of rpdes established in the accompanied paper @xcite , efficient numerical scheme based on finite volume - finite difference methods ( discretization respect to the firm value @xmath1 ) and exponential integrator ( discretization respect to the time @xmath2 ) will be used . recently",
    ", exponential integrators have been used efficiency in many applications in porous media flow @xcite , but are not yet well spread in finance .",
    "the same numerical technique is also used to solve deterministic partial differential equations ( pdes ) modeling debt value or equity value in merton model .",
    "comparisons are done with the real data from firms for each model ( our delay model and merton model ) .    from our comparison",
    ", it comes up that in corporate finance the past dependence of the firm value process is an important feature and therefore should not be ignored .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to call for further attention into the possibility of modeling market value of the firm with nonlinear delayed stochastic differential equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we recall our delayed nonlinear model for corporate claims as presented in @xcite along with the merton model @xcite . in section  [ numeric ] , numerical techniques for our delayed nonlinear model are provided .",
    "we first present the @xmath0 semi implicit euler maruyama for the firm market value @xmath1 and provide numerical experimentations for both our nonlinear model and merton model using real data for some firms .",
    "we end this section by providing numerical technique to solve efficiently our ( rpdes ) modeling the debt and equity of the firm along with numerical experimentations for the two models ( our delayed nonlinear model and merton model ) with real data for some firms .",
