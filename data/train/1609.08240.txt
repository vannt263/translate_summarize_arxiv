    "in particular , we used the 1.3  mm continuum , which principally comes from dust emission , to trace dense cores of @xmath00.1  pc scales , and the 22.2  ghz h@xmath6o maser line emission to pinpoint protostellar population .",

    "then , we searched for dense cores with a visual inspection of the 1.3  mm continuum maps . in sgr  d , a prominent hii region dominates the continuum emission ; the other five clouds do not show strong free - free emission from hii regions and the 1.3  mm continuum can be used to trace dust emission from dense cores .",
