    "the hubble deep field @xcite provided unprecedented information on the nature of the universe at high redshifts ( e.g. abraham et al .",

    "1996 , madau et al .",
    "a similar study of a southern field in the hst continuous viewing zone has just been completed . a primary goal of the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) project will be to further our understanding of the relationship between galaxies and quasar absorption line systems and the hst field will be centred on a bright high  redshift quasar .",
    "the position of the hdf - s field was determined by the location of the bright ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 qso j2233606 , discovered by one of us ( pch ) and m j irwin using apm scans of a ukst objective  prism plate , with confirmation of the object by the aat @xcite .",
    "the main reasons for centring the hdf - s on a high redshift quasar are to compare the absorption line spectrum of the quasar with the redshifts of the galaxies identified in the field , and to probe the quasar environment .",
    "initial spectral observations of j2233606 have already been reported by sealey , webb & drinkwater and savaglio .",
    "sealey et al .",
    "combined observations made with the anu 2.3 m telescope with hst stis observations to yield a low resolution spectrum ( @xmath5 ) over the wide wavelength range @xmath6 .",
    "savaglio reported on intermediate - resolution ( @xmath7 ) observations obtained with the emmi spectrograph on the eso 3.6 m telescope in the wavelength region @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper we report on high - resolution observations ( @xmath9 ) of j2233606 made with the university college of london echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) at the anglo - austrlian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "these observations cover the important wavelength region @xmath10 , comprising much of the key ly@xmath11   forest region .",
    "this data also largely bridges the gap between the hst stis ( @xmath12 ) observations and the existing emmi observations ( @xmath13 ) providing nearly contiguous spectral coverage at resolution of at least @xmath14 over the full wavelength range @xmath15 .",

    "we present the absorption line parameter fits in table  [ list ] .",
    "a total of 10 heavy element systems , as well as 89 ly@xmath11   forest lines were seen in the spectrum .",
    "the hi column density limit in the forest is set mainly by continuum uncertainties , and varies with s /",
    "n . on average the limit is log @xmath16h i@xmath17 for a doppler parameter of 20 km@xmath18s@xmath19 , corresponding to an equivalent width limit of @xmath20m .",
    "we have obtained spectral coverage of the ly@xmath11   forest over the wavelength region 3530  @xmath1 3950  , corresponding to a redshifts from @xmath21 to the emission redshift of the quasar , @xmath4 .",
    "the s / n per 0.05   bin falls off at shorter wavelengths , dropping gradually from @xmath2230 on the ly@xmath11   emission peak , to approximately six at @xmath23 3600 . below @xmath23 3550",
    "the s / n drops dramatically to around three , because this region was not covered in the august 1998 run .",
    "it was included , however , because of the important si@xmath24iii lines corresponding to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 systems .",
    "no other ly@xmath11   lines were detected here .",
    "a total of 89 ly@xmath11   lines were fitted .",
    "the parameter distributions follow a similar pattern to that seen in other quasar spectra ( e.g. lu et al . 1996 ; kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "the h i column density distribution , for 13.3 @xmath27 log @xmath28 16 , is consistent with a power law distribution of slope @xmath29 .",
    "the doppler parameter distribution is well described by a gaussian of mean @xmath30km@xmath18s@xmath19 , @xmath3115 km@xmath18s@xmath19 , and a cut - off below @xmath32km@xmath18s@xmath19 .",
    "about 8 per cent of the ly@xmath11   lines have doppler widths smaller than this , but this could be due to either contamination of the sample by narrower unidentified heavy element lines , or simply noise features . indeed all of these lines have column densities log @xmath28 13.5 , close to the local detection limit .",
    "there is no observed correlation between the doppler widths and column densities of the lines .",
    "a total of 78 heavy element lines have been fitted from eight intervening , and two associated heavy element systems .",
    "one further line was observed at 4390.66 , right at the red end of the spectrum .",
    "it is not associated with any known heavy element system , and is possibly either c@xmath24iv @xmath33 at redshift @xmath34 , or mg@xmath24ii @xmath35 at redshift @xmath36 , although other identifications are possible .",
    "the profile fit was performed with the assumption that the line has the rest wavelength and oscillator strength of ly@xmath11 .",
    "narrow ca@xmath24ii @xmath38 is seen from the interstellar medium in the galaxy .",
    "a single mg@xmath24ii @xmath40 doublet occurs at this redshift , with doppler parameter @xmath41km@xmath18s@xmath19 and column density log @xmath42(mg@xmath24ii ) = 13.1 .",
    "a complex of three c@xmath24iv @xmath44 doublets , spanning 75 km@xmath18s@xmath19 , is seen within the ly@xmath11   forest . although the c@xmath24iv complex is observed in the ly@xmath11   forest , and has no further confirming heavy element lines , the system has a distinctive pattern that makes this a firm identification .",
    "savaglio reported the tentative identification of a mg@xmath24ii doublet at @xmath45 .",
    "however , no corresponding ly@xmath11  absorption line is seen in the stis data and no c@xmath24iv absorption is visible in our spectrum , making the original identification very insecure .      a c@xmath24iv @xmath44 feature , consisting 2 lines separated by @xmath47km@xmath18s@xmath19 was seen at 4011 and 4018 , redward of the ly@xmath11   emission line .",
    "no si@xmath24iv absorption was detected for this system ; log @xmath16si@xmath24iv@xmath48 is a @xmath49 upper limit to the column density .",
    "sealey et al . first reported c@xmath24iv associated with a prominent ly@xmath11   line in the stis data .",

    "mgi @xmath51 was also detected .",
    "the ucles spectrum shows four c@xmath24iv @xmath44 components spanning almost 400 km@xmath18s@xmath19 .",
    "any si@xmath24iv @xmath52 absorption for this system , if significant , was blended with ly@xmath11   lines in the forest , making it impossible to determine a reliable column density .",
    "this heavy element system has a complex structure of nine si@xmath24iv @xmath54 components , spanning 450 km@xmath18s@xmath19 .",
    "savaglio detected complex c@xmath24iv absorption for this system , but noted that much higher s / n would be required to deblend the lines .",
    "she also detected mgi @xmath55 , but the identification of this line ( normally only seen in damped ly@xmath11   systems ) is doubtful .",
    "the ucles spectrum shows a large saturated ly@xmath11   line , fitted by three components , at 3560 . without the constraint of higher order lyman series absorption lines , the column density for this system",
    "is very poorly constrained .",
    "@xmath57 , si@xmath24iii @xmath58 , and si@xmath24iv @xmath52 absorption lines were detected for this system .",
    "2 heavy element components were seen , at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this is over 100 km@xmath18s@xmath19 blueward of the centre of the saturated ly@xmath11   line ; however no heavy element absorption was detected for the central hydrogen component .",
    "sealey et al . investigated this system as a possible cause of the lyman break seen in the stis spectrum at @xmath61 , concluding however that the system at @xmath62 is more likely to be the major contributor .",
    "savaglio searched for heavy element lines associated with this system in the emmi spectrum , finding no associated c@xmath24iv absorption , and only an upper limit to the column density of log @xmath16c@xmath24iv@xmath63 .",
    "this implies that the column density ratios si@xmath24iv",
    "/ c@xmath24iv @xmath64 , and c@xmath24ii / c@xmath24iv @xmath65 , both of which are relatively high @xcite .",
    "savaglio tentatively identified fei@xmath66 and fe@xmath24ii@xmath67 in the emmi spectrum .",
    "further investigation of the spectrum at the exact redshift of the observed heavy element lines shows that these identifications are doubtful .",
    "the ly@xmath11   line is present in the ucles spectrum ( at 3577 ) , but it is saturated , and too noisy to determine an accurate column density directly . if solely responsible for the lyman break seen in the stis spectrum , however , this system has a column density of log @xmath16h@xmath24i@xmath68 .",
    "c@xmath24ii @xmath57 , si@xmath24ii @xmath69 , si@xmath24iii @xmath70 , and si@xmath24iv @xmath52 were all detected in the spectrum , and three components were fitted , at @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "no oi @xmath74 absorption was detected ; a @xmath49 upper limit to the oi column density is log @xmath16o i@xmath75 .",
    "sealey et al . suggested that this system may be a good candidate for a measurement of the d / h ratio .",
    "unfortunately , the weak @xmath71 line lies 60 km@xmath18s@xmath19 blueward of the other two stronger lines , and the hydrogen cloud associated with this line will probably adversely affect any determination of the deuterium abundance from the main system .",
    "savaglio identified strong c@xmath24iv @xmath44 absorption at the same redshift as the absorption features in the ucles data .",
    "mg@xmath24ii @xmath40 , and al@xmath24iii @xmath76 were also detected for the strongest component .",
    "this heavy element system , identified by savaglio , has a weak c@xmath24iv@xmath44 doublet .",
    "the corresponding ly@xmath11   line is seen at @xmath78 and has a log column density of 15.4 .",
    "no associated heavy element lines were found in the ucles spectrum , and a @xmath49 upper limit to the si@xmath24iv column density is log @xmath16si@xmath24iv@xmath79 .",
    "the ucles spectrum shows the clear signature of strong , broad n@xmath24v absorption in the region 3960  @xmath1 3990 .",
    "the corresponding h i absorption , at 3885  @xmath1 3900 , is also broad , and apparently not saturated , indicative of highly ionized systems .",
    "a strong n@xmath24v @xmath81 doublet , and corresponding ly@xmath11   line are seen at @xmath80 .",
    "the n@xmath24v doublet ratio is roughly 1:1 , yet the lines have residual intensity @xmath82 per cent of the continuum .",
    "the likely explanation for this is that there is incomplete coverage of the background source , as has been seen in other objects ( see barlow & sargent   1997 ; hamann et al .",
    "the ly@xmath11   and n@xmath24v lines are consistent with near zero coverage of the emission line gas , and complete coverage of the continuum , implying the cloud is larger than the continuum but smaller than the emission line region .",
    "another possibility is that the absorption lines arise in several regions which are sufficiently cool that they are unresolved , saturated , and distributed over @xmath22 80 km@xmath18s@xmath19 in velocity space so that at the instrument resolution used here the profile is relatively smooth .",
    "we have not explored this far , but the conditions required for this to work at all for both h@xmath24i and n@xmath24v look somewhat contrived .    savaglio observed the c@xmath24iv absorption for this system . it was noted that the equivalent width ratio for the c@xmath24iv doublet was lower than expected , further evidence for incomplete coverage of the source .",
    "the c@xmath24iv emission line is much weaker than the ly@xmath11   emission line and the depth of the c@xmath24iv absorption lines require that the continuum is not completely covered.therefore the absorption is shared between continuum and emission line . assuming all absorption for all ions involved comes from the same region uniformly and there is no velocity - dependent or ion - dependent emission line region geometry , the best - fit covering factors are 50 per cent of the continuum source , and 75 per cent of the emission line region .",
    "this result is partly based on the low s / n emmi spectrum , and further observations of the c@xmath24iv , si@xmath24iv and o@xmath24vi absorption features are required to clarify the picture .      a blend of very broad ( doppler parameter @xmath84 km@xmath18s@xmath19 ) absorption lines , both for n@xmath24v @xmath81 and ly@xmath11 , were fitted for this system .",
    "the fit was complicated by uncertainty in the precise shape of the ly@xmath11   & n@xmath24v emission line continuum over the broad absorption feature , together with uncertainty in the covering factor . also , the n@xmath24v @xmath85 line from the @xmath80 system lay on top of the n@xmath24v @xmath86 line from the @xmath83 system .",
    "we attempted to measure the covering factor , but no constraint was possible , so we assumed it to be 100 per cent .",
    "in order to obtain a satisfactory fit , however , we had to correct the continuum by subtracting a gaussian centred on 3983with fwhm = 670 km@xmath18s@xmath19 , and maximum depth 19 per cent of the original continuum level .",
    "perhaps the most important enhancement of the hdf  s project over its predecessor is the inclusion of the stis instrument observations of the field containing the @xmath4 qso j2233 - 606 .",
    "the stis spectrograph will provide a high resolution ( 10 km@xmath18s@xmath19 ) uv ( @xmath12 ) spectrum of the qso .",
    "furthermore , deep uv , optical and infra - red imaging of the stis and surrounding flanking fields from both the hst and vlt observations will provide morphologies of galaxies near the qso , and allow the accurate determination of photometric redshifts over the full range in absorber redshifts seen in the qso spectrum .",
    "one of the main aims of this project is to investigate the relationship between qso absorbers and high redshift galaxies .",
    "the ground - based observations of the hdf  s qso spectrum , reported here , and by sealey et al . and savaglio , complement the stis spectrum and are crucial to determining the properties of the intervening qso absorbers and their association to galaxies seen in the stis and flanking field images .",
    "in this paper we have reported eight heavy - element absorption systems which are potentially associated with galaxies .",
    "combining this information with the imaging will allow investigation of the relationship between heavy element abundances and galaxy type , environment and impact parameter .",
    "an associated absorption system of this quasar shows evidence for incomplete coverage of both the emission - line region and the continuum source .",
    "further data are required to establish whether or not the coverage is ion dependent , as it is in other such cases ( e.g. hamann et al .",
    "the observations were obtained with the anglo - australian telescope . we thank s. savaglio and h. ferguson for making the emmi and stis data available .",
