    "the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , one of the most studied theoretical puzzles in particle physics , is yet unknown .",
    "it is anticipated that the lhc , that has already began its historic mission of collecting data at 7 tev collision energy , will provide insight into the heart of this problem . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", ewsb is triggered by the higgs mechanism with a single fundamental scalar , leaving its mass unprotected from radiative corrections at the cutoff scale .",
    "this is known as the hierarchy problem : the tension between the cutoff scale ( planck scale or gut scale ) and the seemingly unnatural electroweak ( ew ) scale , which is usually interpreted as evidence for new physics at the tev scale .",
    "hints for the existence of a higgs boson have been recently reported at the lhc : atlas finds an excess of events around @xmath8 gev with a local significance of 3.5 standard deviations @xcite , while cms sees a smaller excess with a local significance of 3.1 sigma around @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown at the tevatron @xcite that there is a possibility of an excess of events corresponding to @xmath10 between 115 gev and 135 gev .",
    "it is , therefore , tempting to consider a higgs mass in the range @xmath11 gev .",
    "the lhc with higher integrated luminosity and 8 tev c.m .",
    "energy should unveil more precise details about the higgs boson .    in the past few years , several tensions between experiments and the sm predictions were observed in flavor physics @xcite .",
    "it was noted , that adding a fourth sequential generation ( for reviews see @xcite ) to the sm ( the so called sm4 which in some instances will be referred to as the `` naive '' four generations model ) might not only be able to resolve these tensions @xcite , but may also address the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the new fermion states are heavy enough , their yukawa couplings are driven to a landau pole or a fixed point , possibly at the tev scale , where some form of strong dynamics might be responsible for dynamically breaking the ew symmetry .",
    "besides , the additional cp - violating phases in the presence of a fourth family @xcite may be useful for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the fact that adding a heavy fourth generation to the sm implies new physics at @xmath12 , serves as a strong hint that the sm4 is not an appropriate framework to account for the expected ( possibly strong ) dynamics in the presence of these new heavy fermionic states . for this purpose and others , models that go beyond the sm4 ( bsm4 ) were introduced as an alternative to the naive sm4 framework @xcite .",
    "one way to incorporate the low - energy effects of such possible tev - scale strong dynamics in an acceptable phenomenological approach is multi - higgs scenarios , which may naturally account for the composite scalars associated with the new strong dynamics , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "an example of a model designed for this purpose , the 4g2hdm ( a model with 2 higgs doublets and a fourth family of fermions ) , was proposed in @xcite , and was shown to agree with electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) in a wide range of its parameter space .",
    "an alternative interesting approach to the compositeness picture is warped extra - dimension scenarios , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "other examples of bsm4 scenarios were suggested in @xcite .",
    "recently , assuming the sm4 framework , cms reported @xcite a 450 gev lower limit on the @xmath0 mass in the semileptonic channel ( @xmath13_{hadronic } b \\left[w^-\\right]_{leptonic } \\overline{b}\\rightarrow \\ell \\nu bq\\overline{q } \\overline{b } $ ] ) , and a 557 gev lower limit in the dilepton channel ( @xmath14_{leptonic } b \\left[w^-\\right]_{leptonic } \\overline{b}\\rightarrow \\ell^+ \\ell^- \\nu \\overline{\\nu } b\\overline{b}$ ] ) , replacing the weaker tevatron limits @xcite .",
    "the most recent lower bounds on the @xmath15 mass are 480 gev @xcite ( atlas ) and 611 gev @xcite ( cms ) .",
    "in addition , the single higgs of the sm4 is excluded now by cms in the range @xmath16 gev @xcite .",
    "we argue , that these seemingly stringent limits apply only to the sm4 framework , which is disfavored for reasons that are outlined above .",
    "in particular , in bsm4 frameworks , collider signals of fourth generation fermions and/or higgs particles may be drastically altered , leading to weaker bounds .",
    "an example of this was discussed in @xcite , where an extended higgs sector ( with 4th generation fermions ) may highly suppress the signal for higgs production , circumventing the current limits on the sm4 higgs mass .",
    "the purpose of this work is , therefore , to illustrate that , in general , the limits on the @xmath0 mass can be considerably weaker with respect to the sm4 case .",
    "we demonstrate that in the 4g2hdm framework of @xcite , where new decay patterns of @xmath0 emerge through the scalar sector : e.g. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we thus propose an alternative search method , more general and , therefore , more suitable to searches for bsm4 scenarios .",
    "as mentioned above , cms has recently reported @xcite a 557 gev lower bound on the @xmath0 mass , replacing the previous limits by cdf @xcite ( 358 gev ) and d0 @xcite ( 285 gev ) @xcite .",
    "a summary on the tevatron limits can be found at @xcite .",
    "these searches assume @xmath19 ( sm4 ) and focus on either the semileptonic channel ( @xmath20 ) or the dilepton channel ( @xmath21 ) in the @xmath0 pair production ( for a limit that takes into account the branching ratios in @xmath0 decay within the sm4 , see @xcite ) : @xmath22_{hadronic / leptonic } b \\left[w^-\\right]_{leptonic } \\overline{b}\\rightarrow l \\nu bq\\overline{q } \\overline{b}/l^+l^- \\nu \\overline{\\nu } b \\overline{b}\\ ] ]    the limits for the semileptonic channel were extracted using two dimensional fits to @xmath23 and @xmath24 - the reconstructed mass of the @xmath0 and the scalar sum of @xmath25 of the visible jets and leptons and missing @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "in particular , the mass of the @xmath0 is reconstructed by fitting each event to the process @xmath27",
    ", i.e. , taking the 4 leading jets ( with highest @xmath25 ) and minimizing the @xmath28 for the equations : @xmath29    on the other hand , the analysis for the dilepton channel relies on the fact that @xmath30 , which is the invariant mass of a pair of any lepton and a @xmath31-jet in the event , is much higher in the @xmath32 signal with respect to the leading @xmath33 background . in particular , in the case of @xmath33 , @xmath30 has an upper bound that corresponds to the mass of the top quark , and therefore in the region above 170 gev ( `` signal region '' ) @xmath30 is a clean signal for the @xmath0 .",
    "distribution for the sm4 @xmath34 signature ( blue ) and for the 4g2hdm 6@xmath35 + 2@xmath31 signature ( red ) , for a set of 7 tev lhc events with @xmath36 fb@xmath37 . for both signatures",
    "@xmath38 gev is assumed .",
    "the peak of the distribution of @xmath23 for the sm4 signature is around @xmath39 , while for the new signature the peak is shifted to a significantly lower value coinciding with the peak of the @xmath40 background .",
    "[ mfit_ww ] ]    below we will study the relevance of these limits in the general bsm4 case , in the feasible scenario where @xmath41 is not the leading @xmath0 decay channel .",
    "this may occur in models with an extended higgs sector , e.g. in the 4g2hdm suggested in @xcite .",
    "in such models , the new scalars play a crucial role in the @xmath0 phenomenology , and new channels like @xmath17 , @xmath42 ( see also @xcite ) or even the sm4 forbidden @xmath43 may dominate .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that all these channels are allowed by ewpd , and some of them dominate within large areas in the ( ewpd allowed ) parameter space .",
    "thus , in this scenario , @xmath44 are no longer the leading signatures for @xmath0 pair production at the lhc ; the new channels can dominate , giving rise to several possible new signatures for @xmath0 at the lhc ( see section 4 ) .",
    "we argue that for these cases , the cms fit to @xmath45 and @xmath46 should fail , as it attempts to impose these specific sm4-motivated dynamics on processes that have a completely different topology .",
    "in particular , for the semileptonic channel , taking only 4 leading jets out of all the jets in the event will miss a large part of the energy of the event and will , therefore , result in @xmath23 being substantially lower- exactly where the main @xmath33 background is .",
    "an example of that can be seen in figure  [ mfit_ww ] for the 6@xmath35 + 2@xmath31 signature which occurs in the 4g2hdm ( see section 4 ) . for the dilepton channel , the analysis will fail for signatures with more than 2 leptons or @xmath31-jets , as the combinatorial background will lower the @xmath30 ( see section 6 ) , resulting in much less events in the signal region .    in the semileptonic channel the kinematics of each event",
    "is completely determined , thus we suggest using a reconstruction that does not assume a specific decay chain , and instead reconstructs any event of the type @xmath20 under the sole assumption that the lepton and the missing energy are the result of the leptonic decay of a w boson , similarly to @xcite .",
    "this will result in the correct reconstruction of @xmath32 events ( see section 5 ) , regardless of the specific decay signature .",
    "the specifics of the such a reconstruction strategy are the following : we select all the jets with transverse momentum that is high enough , we then reconstruct the leptonic w and choose the correct partition of the event ( which jet is originated from @xmath0 and which one from @xmath47 ) by minimizing the @xmath28 of the following equations @xmath48    another important point to notice is that for all the new signatures , the number of jets in the final state is higher than the sm background , and for some of the signatures there is also an excess of @xmath31-jets , as will be shown in section 4 .",
    "we will use cuts based on these properties in section 5 , and , as we will further show , this will result in higher detection sensitivity for these signatures .",
    "let us recapitulate the underlying properties of the 4g2hdm , the full account of which appears in  @xcite . +",
    "the 4g2hdm is a two - higgs doublet model with 4 generations of chiral fermions , where the yukawa terms are defined as follows : @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is the left - handed su(2 ) quark doublet , @xmath51 are the left ( right)- handed fermion fields and @xmath52,@xmath53 are arbitrary 4x4 yukawa matrices in flavor space . also , @xmath54 is the identity matrix , @xmath55 are diagonal matrices defined as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the two higgs doublets .",
    "+ the different choices of @xmath59 will result in different yukawa textures and , therfore , different models . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath60 for which @xmath58 couples only to the @xmath61 generations quarks , while @xmath62 couples to the first 3 generations .",
    "this setup was defined as 4g2hdm of type",
    "i in @xcite and is partly motivated by the absence of ( tree - level ) fcnc in the first 3 generations . in particular , in this case , fcnc is only allowed between the third and fourth generations and it plays a crucial role in the phenomenology of the 4th generation fermions .",
    "+ the physical higgs scalars that emerge after ewsb are : @xmath63 ( charged scalar),@xmath64,@xmath65 ( lighter and heavier cp - even neutral scalars ) and @xmath66 ( cp - odd neutral scalar ) .",
    "their couplings to the quarks are given by : @xmath67r+          , \\\\",
    "& \\left[-m_{u_{i}}tan\\beta v_{u_{i}d_{j}}+m_{u_{k}}(tan\\beta+cot\\beta)\\sigma_{ki}^{u*}v_{kj}\\right]l\\ } d_{j}h^{+ }    , \\end{split } \\label{yuk}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is 4x4 ckm matrix , @xmath71 is the mixing angle in the cp even neutral higgs sector and @xmath72 is the ratio between the vev of @xmath58 and the vev of @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "also , @xmath74 are new mixing matrices in the up and the down sectors accordingly , which , for our choice of @xmath59 , can be parametrized in the following way  @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 effectively parametrize the mixing between the third and fourth generation quarks in the down and up sectors , respectively . in the following",
    "we will set @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as natural values representative for these quantities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , in the 4g2hdm the @xmath61 generation quarks have a more complex decay pattern that stems from their interactions with the extended higgs sector .",
    "in addition , the sm4 forbidden channels , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are no longer in contradiction with the ewpd , and may be kinematically open as well . for simplification , we will assume that @xmath64 is the only neutral scalar light enough to take part in the decays of @xmath0 and @xmath80 .",
    "we will thus consider the following decay modes :    1 .",
    "@xmath17 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath42 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "3 .   @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "4 .   @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we assume the decay mode @xmath87 to be kinematically closed taking @xmath88 to be larger than the mass gap in the fourth generation doublet .",
    "+ to complete the picture of @xmath0 and @xmath80 decays , we need to fully account for the light neutral and charged higgs decays . for @xmath64",
    "we have :     as a function of @xmath71 for @xmath89 gev and @xmath90 . [ rgg ] ]    1 .",
    "this decay mode is prominent for @xmath92 gev .",
    "2 .   @xmath93 .",
    "these modes can be suppressed in this model ( as in any 2hdm model ) , due to the @xmath94 factor in the @xmath95 and @xmath96 vertices .",
    "3 .   @xmath97 .",
    "both channels are loop induced . in the sm4 , @xmath98 is the leading decay channel for @xmath99 gev and is about 10 times larger than the sm , while @xmath100 is about 10 times smaller than the sm value @xcite . on the other hand , in the 4g2hdm , @xmath98 could be suppressed in some areas of the parameter space , as a result of a destructive interference between the heavy fermion loops due to extra factors in the corresponding yukawa terms which depend on the angles @xmath71 and @xmath101 ( see eq .",
    "[ yuk ] ) .",
    "this would lead to either a suppression or enhancement of light higgs production by gluon fusion as a function of @xmath71 , as is demonstrated in figure  [ rgg ] .",
    "it is obvious that , even for the `` popular '' choice of @xmath102 , the enhancement of higgs production is only by a factor of  2 , which is almost 5 times smaller than the corresponding enhancement in the sm4 .",
    "this is an example of how an extended higgs sector may suppress the higgs production signal ( see also @xcite ) , providing a possible explanation of the absence of an observed signal @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath100 could be enhanced or suppressed in the 4g2hdm with respect to the sm4 or the sm @xcite .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this work and therefore will not be discussed here .",

    "the statistical significance drops , e.g. , to the level of @xmath180 for the two signatures when @xmath161 gev .",
    "in contrast , applying the `` standard '' cms method ( i.e. using @xmath23 instead of @xmath166 and requiring that at least one of the jets is tagged as a @xmath31-jet instead of the @xmath181 cut ) , we get @xmath182 for @xmath173 gev and @xmath183 for @xmath161 gev .",
    "we proceed to test the consistency of the cms exclusions results in the semileptonic channel ( which exclude @xmath184 as is the case in the sm4 ) with the existence of a bsm4 signal in the current data .",
    "we recall that the cms analysis is based on a 2d ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) likelihood fit to the data under the hypothesis of signal ( sm4 ) + background and the hypothesis of background only , and a cls method @xcite for the computation of the exclusion limits .",
    "they found that @xmath185 gev at 95% cl ( for the sm4 case ) @xcite .",
    "mass assuming the sm4 signature in the semileptonic channel ( @xmath20 ) . for the case of background",
    "only , the red doted line is the median and the yellow and green bands are the @xmath186 and @xmath187 standard deviations accordingly . the black line is the median for background + @xmath188 with @xmath161 gev and the blue line is the median for background + @xmath189 with @xmath173 gev . the results for the rest of the signatures with @xmath190 gev lie between these two lines . [ limit ] ]    we perform a simplified computation of what would the cms exclusion limit be for @xmath167 in the case of background only and in the case of background+bsm4 .",
    "to do so , we generate 1000 lhc events ( @xmath36 fb@xmath37 ) for each case .",
    "we then use the ratio @xmath191 of the likelihoods to the signal ( sm4 ) + background hypothesis ( @xmath192 ) and to the background hypothesis ( @xmath193 ) , as the test statistic .",
    "we naively assign a 20% systematic uncertainty on the background cross - section , minimizing the likelihood with respect to this parameter in each case .",
    "we calculate the likelihood ration ( @xmath194 ) for each simulated signature , and determine the probability to observe a higher value of @xmath194 for the background only hypothesis ( @xmath195 ) and the signal+background hypothesis(@xmath196 ) ) .",
    "the 95% cl limit on the signal cross - section is then the value of the signal cross - section @xmath197 , for which @xmath198 finally , we calculate the distribution of the 95% cl limit on the signal cross - section for background only and for background+bsm4 hypothesis , and plot in figure  [ limit ] the exclusion limits for background only , and for background with two chosen bsm4 signatures for @xmath131 pair production : @xmath199 with @xmath200 gev and @xmath201 with @xmath173 gev .",
    "the exclusion limits for all the other bsm4 signatures that we ve checked ( 6@xmath31 + 2@xmath35,2@xmath35 + 6@xmath31 with @xmath149 gev ) are between these two limits for the chosen signatures .",
    "we observe that for @xmath173 gev , the median of the exclusion limit distribution for the bsm4 signatures is within 2 standard deviations of the expected limit for the background only case , and for @xmath161 gev it is fully within 1 standard deviation of the expected limit for the background only case .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between the cms observed exclusion limit , which is close to the expected one , see @xcite ( the expected limit in our naive calculation is denoted by the red dotted line in figure  [ limit ] ) , and the aforementioned bsm4 scenarios is less than @xmath202 for @xmath203 gev , and 1 - 2@xmath197 for @xmath173 gev .",
    "we , therefore , go on to conclude that bsm4 scenarios with @xmath204 gev , can be consistent with the current semileptonic data and therefore the limit on the @xmath131 mass for the bsm4 case should be around @xmath205 gev in the semileptonic channel .",
    "the most stringent bounds to this date on the @xmath131 mass ( 557 gev ) are set by the cms , analyzing the dilepton channel ( @xmath206 ) for @xmath207 pair production and decay at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the signal in this channel is relatively rare ( about 11% of the @xmath208 events ) but clean due to the presence of the two leptons that suppresses the sm background .",
    "the suppression of the background is further promoted by requiring that exactly two of the jets in each selected event are tagged as @xmath31-jets . the kinematic variable that is used to discriminate the signal from the huge @xmath33 background is the invariant mass of one of the leptons and one of the @xmath31-jets , @xmath209 , where the configuration with the lowest invariant mass is chosen . in the case of @xmath33 production",
    "this invariant mass is bounded from above by the top mass ( 170 gev ) , while for the @xmath208 signal , there should be a large portion of events giving @xmath210 .",
    "this leaves the region above this mass ( named the `` signal region '' ) almost background - free ( except mostly misidentification background ) and completely signal - dominated . the number of events in the signal region is therefore used for the limit calculation .",
    "when the new textures of @xmath131 decay with higher multiplicities of leptons and @xmath31-jets are considered , the dominance of the signal for @xmath210 gev may no longer be realized , due to the combinatorial background and the altered kinematic shape of the events .",
    "we try to address this issue using a simulation similar to the one in the previous section , with different selection rules .",
    "we generate @xmath208 events with @xmath172 fb@xmath37 for the sm4-like 2@xmath35 + 2@xmath31 signature and for the new 2@xmath35 + 6@xmath31 signature , choosing @xmath173 gev and selecting events with at least two leptons and exactly two @xmath31-jets , with the kinematic cuts that were used in the cms analysis @xcite . due to the fact that the @xmath31-tagging efficiency in pgs @xcite is not well calibrated with the efficiency of the tchem method of @xmath31-tagging @xcite that was used in the cms analysis",
    ", we get a lower number of events for the sm4-like signature than the number of events reported in @xcite .",
    "we thus use a higher efficiency to roughly simulate the correct number of events in the signal region .",
    "thus , our results below should be considered only as an illustration of the effect of bsm4 .     for the sm4-like @xmath211 signature ( red ) and for the bsm4 @xmath160 signature(blue ) with @xmath173 gev for a set of 7 tev lhc events with @xmath212 fb@xmath37 in the dilepton channel .",
    "the black line is approximately at the top mass and the region to the right of the line is the signal region .",
    "[ mlb_dilepton ] ]    the results are presented in figure  [ mlb_dilepton ] .",
    "we first note , that the total number of selected events is lower for the 2@xmath35 + 6@xmath31 than for the sm4 case .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is a higher number of @xmath31 jets ( 6 ) in 2@xmath35 + 6@xmath31 events , thus , for high enough @xmath31-tagging efficiency ( above 0.5 ) there is a lower chance of tagging exactly 2 of them . in the signal region , the number of the events for the 2@xmath35 + 6@xmath31 signature is negligible- about 1/10 of the events in sm4 case .",
    "in fact , for @xmath204 gev , the number of 2@xmath35 + 6@xmath31 events in the signal region is even lower due to the lower production cross - section . we therefore conclude that the current stringent limit on the @xmath131 mass ( 557 gev ) in the dilepton channel is completely irrelevant for some bsm4 scenarios , for @xmath204 gev ( we recall that @xmath173 gev is the lowest mass considered in @xcite ) .",
    "we have explored new detection strategies for the @xmath131 that hold in the general case , where new decay patterns ( beyond the sm4 ) for @xmath131 emerge , e.g. @xmath213 . in such cases , new @xmath131 signals , such as @xmath214 and @xmath215 that we have studied here",
    "may dominate . as a representative framework for bsm4 we chose the 4g2hdm of @xcite , which is a variation of a 2hdm framework with 4 generations .",
    "we then studied its implications for @xmath131 phenomenology at the lhc , keeping the analysis as general as possible and , therefore , model - independent to a large extent .",
    "we have shown that if the new @xmath131 decay channels lead to @xmath216 or to @xmath217 , then the current limits on the @xmath131 mass ( 450/557 gev for the semileptonic and the dilepton channel in the sm4 case ) do not apply and a different detection strategy is required . for the semileptonic channel , we estimate the current limit on the @xmath131 mass in the bsm4 case to be around 350 gev , demonstrating that a general reconstruction method ( without the assumption of a specific topology of each event ) is successful in pushing the limit upwards .    in the dilepton channel",
    ", we find the cms limit to be completely irrelevant for the mass range in the analysis ( 350 - 600 gev ) for several bsm4 scenarios .",
    "this includes the case that the mass of the lightest higgs is around 130 gev , which may be consistent with what atlas and cms see in the higgs searches .",
    "we leave for a future study the constraints on new scenarios resulting from the @xmath218 searches at the lhc @xcite .",
