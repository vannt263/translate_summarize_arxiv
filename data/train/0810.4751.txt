    "at the tevatron , top quarks are mainly produced in top - antitop - quark ( @xmath0 ) pairs .",
    "since the initial proton - antiproton ( @xmath1 ) state is not a charge conjugation ( @xmath4 ) eigenstate , the final state is not expected to be symmetric under @xmath4 either .",
    "the charge asymmetry is therefore not expected to vanish and can be translated to a forward - backward asymmetry . because of limited statistics , instead of a differential measurement this analysis @xcite measures the integrated forward - backward asymmetry : @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the number of forward ( backward ) events , meaning events , where the rapidity difference @xmath8 between top quark and antitop quark is positive ( negative ) .    at leading - order ( lo ) @xmath0",
    "production is charge symmetric .",
    "however , starting at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) , an asymmetry arises from the inferences between production diagrams .",
    "a total asymmetry of 45% is expected @xcite .",
    "the contributions to @xmath9 differ depending on which processes interfere .",
    "they are positive ( 6.4% nlo ) for @xmath10 processes while they are negative ( -(78)% nlo , -(30)% nnlo ) for @xmath11 processes , which result in at least one more jet in the final state @xcite . by measuring the asymmetry for different jet multiplicities ,",
    "this analysis attempts to verify this behavior .",
    "the presented analysis uses approximately 900  pb@xmath2 of data collected by the d  experiment @xcite at fermilab and proceeds with the following steps .",
    "first a sample enriched in @xmath0  events is selected , then each event is fully reconstructed using a kinematic fitter .",
    "after that , the sample is fitted for sample composition and asymmetry simultaneously . to suppress model - dependent effects ,",

    "the subsequent decay of the @xmath15  boson determines the event topology . for this analysis",
    ", we consider the decay channel with one @xmath15  boson decaying to hadrons and the other one to leptons .",
    "the resulting final state consists of one high-@xmath17  lepton , missing transverse energy @xmath18  from the neutrino , two jets originating from a long - lived @xmath16 hadron ( @xmath16 jet ) , and two light quark jets .",
    "this will be referred to as the lepton+jets channel .",
    "based on the final state , events with @xmath124 reconstructed jets are selected .",
    "the jets have to have transverse momentum @xmath19  gev ( 35  gev for the leading jet ) and pseudorapidity @xmath20 .",
    "at least one of the jets has to be identified as a @xmath16 jet by a neural network tagging algorithm @xcite .",
    "we also require exactly one isolated electron with @xmath21  gev and @xmath22 or one isolated muon with @xmath23  gev and @xmath24 .",
    "the event has to have a primary vertex , which fulfills certain quality requirements , and @xmath25  gev .",
    "after the selection , each event is reconstructed to a @xmath0  hypothesis by a kinematic fitter @xcite .",
    "it varies the four - momenta of each object within their resolutions and minimizes a @xmath26 statistic under the constraint that the @xmath15  boson masses are exactly 80.4  gev and the top quark masses exactly 170  gev .",
    "the @xmath16-tagging information is used to reduce the jet combinatorics .",
    "although it is also possible to determine the aysmmetry using only the lepton charge and direction , reconstructing the whole event doubles the sensitivity .      the largest background processes to @xmath0  production are @xmath15+jets and multijet production .",

    "a likelihood discriminant @xmath27 is defined , which is based on variables which are well - modeled by monte carlo , provide good separation between @xmath0  and @xmath15+jets , and do not bias the rapidity difference @xmath28 .",
    "the asymmetry of the @xmath15+jets background is suppressed by the kinematic fit , and the remaining asymmetry is estimated by simulation .",
    "the other small sources of background are taken into account in the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the likelihood distributions are fitted simultaneously for sample composition and sign of @xmath29 using a maximum likelihood method .",
