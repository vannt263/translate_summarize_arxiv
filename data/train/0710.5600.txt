    "motion of a fluid confined between two concentric , rotating cylinders is a classical problem in hydrodynamics and , if the fluid is conducting and an external magnetic field is applied , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "the flow of this type , usually referred to as the taylor - couette flow , has been first studied by couette  @xcite and later was subject of a seminal work by taylor  @xcite , who experimentally confirmed theoretical results of a linear stability analysis . in the field of mhd ,",
    "an important work was done by velikhov  @xcite who has shown that for the conducting fluid a weak magnetic field can play a destabilizing role and can lead to an instability which today is called magnetorotational instability ( mri  @xcite ) .",
    "when studying the taylor - couette system it is common to assume some simplifications , the small gap approximation or large aspect ratio . in the former it is assumed that the gap between the cylinders @xmath4 is small compared to the radii , i.e. , @xmath5 , this allows the neglect of terms of order @xmath6 , @xmath7 being distance from the center of rotation .",
    "when considering the large aspect ratio , one assumes that the height of the cylinders @xmath8 is much larger than the gap width @xmath9 , which guarantees that a secondary flow due to the plates bounding the cylinders is insignificant and does not disturb the rotational profile of the fluid .    on the other hand",
    ", there is also plenty of work done for small aspect ratio @xmath10 , where the rigidly rotating end - plates play crucial role and simply introduce a new class of problems . when @xmath11 becomes an important parameter it is possible to observe a wide family of different states ( including non - axisymmetric ones or peculiar asymmetric patterns  anomalous modes ) for the same parameters , so that the observed results depend on their path through the parameters space from an initial state .",
    "therefore this system is an excellent subject to the bifurcation theory  @xcite .    in the present work we focus on the case of wide gap @xmath12 and @xmath13 which is an intermediate aspect ratio , between very short and long containers , yet",
    "in purely hydrodynamical contest the influence of the vertical boundaries is small , at least for reynolds numbers of order @xmath14 .",
    "however , if the rotation rates are large enough , so that the corresponding reynolds number is @xmath15 and larger , the plates can easily dominate the flow in the entire container .",
    "this is due to the taylor - proudman theorem , from which follows that in rapidly rotating systems the flow tends to align itself along the axis of rotation . for such rotations",
    "it is necessary that @xmath11 would have to be several thousand in order to obtain the rotational profile which is not profoundly altered by the end - plates  @xcite .",
    "results of a recent mri experiment promise  @xcite , as well as nonlinear simulations  @xcite indicate that for a flow with relatively small reynolds number @xmath16 , and parameters resembling essentially mhd stable flow in the limit of infinitely long cylinders , there exist unexpected time - dependent fluctuation of the velocity field .",
    "these disturbances arise as an effect of the vertical boundary conditions , moreover the simulations show that they are much stronger if the end - plates bounding the cylinders are assumed to be perfectly conducting .",
    "the plates induce a well known hydrodynamical effect  the ekman circulation , which is a result of unbalanced pressure gradients in vicinity of the vertical no - slip boundary conditions . there",
    "the ekman layer develops in which the fluid velocity from the bulk of the container must match the velocity imposed by the end - plates .",
    "it seems that for mhd taylor - couette flow , magnetic effects , unlike the classical hydrodynamical ekman layer , induced by the plates have been overlooked . in this paper",
    "we argue that the rigidly rotating plates together with an imposed axial magnetic field give rise to a similar layer which develops for an infinite , rotating plate serving as a boundary for the conducting fluid .",
    "one of the most important features of such flow is the existence of the hartmann current ( absent in the conventional hartmann problem ,  @xcite ) which leaves the boundary layer and then interacts with the magnetic field . in particular",
    ", this becomes important for conducting plates which was the case for the promise experiment , since one of the end - plates was made from copper .",
    "we discuss properties of ekman - hartmann layers for infinite , rotating plates and relate it to the end - plates enclosing the cylinders in a taylor - couette setup .",
    "it is shown that for considered radial boundary conditions , the induced current turn eventually in the radial direction and acting in concert with the imposed axial magnetic field gives rise to a body force .",
    "we demonstrate that magnetic effects induced by the end - plates enclosing the cylinders can profoundly alter flow properties .",
    "in particular the rotational profile can become significantly different from the expected parabolic couette solution .",
    "moreover , if the hartmann current is strong enough , it is likely that the local rayleigh criterion for stability will be violated and the flow becomes centrifugally unstable . in an mri experiment",
    "it is crucial to rule out such instabilities and a special care concerning the vertical boundary conditions is needed in order to obtain the desired rotational profile .",
    "we consider two concentric cylinders with radii @xmath17 embedded in an external axial magnetic field .",
    "they rotate with angular velocities @xmath18 , the radius ratio is @xmath19 , the rotation ratio @xmath20 .",
    "cylindrical coordinates @xmath21 with unit vectors @xmath22 are used . if the cylinders are unbounded , i.e. , infinitely long or periodic , the rotational profile is @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 everywhere .",
    "the flow is hydrodynamically stable if the rayleigh criterion @xmath26 is fulfilled , i.e. , for @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , for the considered radius ratio @xmath28 , the flow is always stable if @xmath29 .",
    "here we consider only cases when @xmath29 so that hydrodynamical instabilities are ruled out .",
    "let us introduce the reynolds number @xmath2 , which measures the rotation rates , and the hartmann number @xmath30 , which measures the strength of the externally applied magnetic field @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the density , @xmath34 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath35 is the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath36 is the magnetic permeability .",
    "the fluid confined between the cylinders is assumed to be incompressible and it can be characterized by the magnetic prandtl number @xmath37 . for laboratory liquid metals , like gallium , @xmath38 is very small  of order @xmath39 , therefore we concentrate on effects arising only when @xmath38 is small .      using @xmath40 as the unit of length , @xmath41 as the unit of velocity , @xmath42 as the unit of time , @xmath43 as the unit of the axial magnetic field and assuming @xmath44 we can write non - dimensional mhd equations for the problem of our interest , i.e.    [ eq : mhd ] @xmath45 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\label{eqn - momentum}\\\\    \\lefteqn {   \\partial_t { \\textbf{b } } =                    \\frac{1}{\\pm } { \\nabla^2}{\\textbf{b } }            + { \\mathop{\\rm rot}\\nolimits ( { \\textbf{u } } \\times { \\textbf{b } } ) }           + { \\mathop{\\rm rot}\\nolimits ( { \\textbf{u } } \\times \\bext / b_0 ) } , } \\label{eqn - induc}\\ ] ]    with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the velocity and the perturbed magnetic field , @xmath49 is the pressure .    for the velocity",
    "we apply no - slip boundary conditions at the cylinders and at the end - plates as well .",
    "we assume that both the plates rotate rigidly with angular velocity @xmath50 , which can be set to any value so that the plates can rotate independently of the cylinders .",
    "boundary conditions for the magnetic field are determined by magnetic properties of the cylinders and the plates .",
    "here we consider only perfectly conducting radial boundaries , so that the transverse currents and perpendicular component of the magnetic field vanish , hence @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "we chose such boundaries since in the promise experiment the cylinders were made of copper .",
    "the reason for choosing copper is that the critical @xmath2 and @xmath30 numbers for the onset of the mri are smaller by almost a factor of 2 with perfectly conducting boundaries than with insulating boundaries @xcite .    for the end - plates , similarly like for the walls ,",
    "the electric field must be continuous and @xmath53 , then @xmath54 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 where @xmath58 characterizes a thin layer of relative conductance of the fluid and the plates  @xcite . when @xmath59 we obtain conditions corresponding to insulating end - plates , i.e. , @xmath60 at @xmath61 , @xmath62 being the azimuthal current .",
    "for @xmath63 we have the case describing the perfectly conducting plates , @xmath64 at @xmath61 .",
    "we note that this thin - wall approximation is valid only when the magnetic field varies linearly within the plates and it does not necessarily resembles situation in a real experiment .      for laboratory liquids",
    "the conductivity @xmath65 is small , so that the magnetic diffusivity @xmath66 is very large ( compared to the viscosity ) and the corresponding magnetic prandtl number @xmath38 is small .",
    "consequently the time scale for magnetic diffusion is much shorter than other time scales .",
    "therefore we consider the limit @xmath67 , however it must be supposed that @xmath30 tends to a finite value .",
    "the perturbations @xmath48 of the externally applied field induced by the motion of the fluid are @xmath38 times smaller than @xmath68 , although theirs effect on the lorentz force can not be neglected since @xmath69@xmath70 $ ] is already of order @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless the interactions @xmath71 are vanishingly small .    similarly in the induction equation we may apply a quasi - static approximation",
    ", so that the electromagnetic field proceeds along a sequence of steady - state solutions of the maxwell equations to conditions described by @xmath47 , and therefore @xmath48 in each moment adjusts instantaneously to the velocity @xmath47 .",
    "hence , in the small prandtl limit @xmath72 , the system can be written as    [ eq : quasimhd ] @xmath73    with @xmath74 ,  @xcite .",
    "the equations   together with the discussed boundary conditions are solved with finite difference method using stream function - vorticity formulation in the @xmath75 plane . in this work",
    "we assume that the flow is axisymmetric . for more details on the numerical procedure",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "at an interface between an incompressible fluid with low viscosity and a rapidly rotating rigid surface develops an ekman layer with thickness @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is rate of uniform rotation .",
    "similarly for a flow of conducting , incompressible fluid in vicinity of a rigid non - rotating boundary , and under the influence of an external magnetic field perpendicular to the surface there exists a hartman layer with thickness @xmath78 . when these two effects are combined , the ekman - hartmann layer develops  @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed either as a modification of the ekman layer by introducing the conducting fluid and imposing the external magnetic field or as a modification of the hartmann layer by adding the uniform rotation of the bounding surface . the resulting layer ( in its steady form )",
    "assures a proper transition for the velocity and the magnetic field from values inside the bulk of the fluid to the applied boundary conditions .",
    "the linear analysis of the ekman - hartmann layer in its idealized case was presented by  @xcite .",
    "they have considered an infinite , insulating plate rotating with @xmath79 at @xmath55 , and a conducting fluid filling the space @xmath80 , the fluid far from the plate rotates with @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the most important conclusion of this work was that in addition to the well known ekman suction / blowing of mass flux there also exists an electric hartmann current which has the same direction ( or opposite when the external @xmath83 is negative ) as the velocity of the ekman blowing ( that if fluid is blown away or sucked towards the boundaries depends only on sign of @xmath84 ) .",
    "this current , which is arising due to the vertical shears , leaves the ekman - hartmann layer and potentially influences the flow far away from the boundary .",
    "for the magnetized taylor - couette with finite aspect ratio , i.e. , if the cylinders are covered with rigidly rotating end - plates ( insulating or conducting ) , the ekman - hartmann layer also develops .",
    "naturally influence of the vertical walls introduces additional important effects and direct quantitative comparison with the previous work is not possible .",
    "we must take into account that the fluid which was ejected due to the ekman blowing mechanism must eventually get back due to the conservation of mass and finiteness of the container .",
    "nevertheless we will show that the rotating end - plates induce the hartmann current which can change the global properties of the flow .",
    "let us introduce the parameter @xmath85 which measures the overall importance of the magnetic field , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the hartmann depth .",
    "for the ekman depth , as a measure of the uniform rotation we use @xmath88 .",
    "the magnetic effects start to be significant when @xmath89 , in the limit @xmath90 we have the classical ekman layer and for @xmath91 the classical hartmann layer .",
    "we notice that for slow rotation corresponding to @xmath2 of order @xmath14 and @xmath30 of order @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and therefore we expect the magnetic fields to be important for many laboratory experiments .",
    "first we consider a case when both the cylinders rotate with the same angular velocity @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 , and the rotational profile is flat .",
    "the aspect ratio is @xmath13 and the insulating plates rotate with angular velocity slightly different than the cylinders , @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ehstruct ] shows how the axial velocity @xmath97 and the axial current @xmath98 change with distance @xmath99 from the plates , for different strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "it can be seen that the axial velocity and the axial current decrease for stronger magnetic field .",
    "the explanation is as follows .",
    "the vertical shears in @xmath100 and @xmath97 produce currents which together with axial field generate body forces acting against the shears .",
    "since the radial flow must vanish at the boundaries as well as it vanishes far away from them , the effect is to reduce the @xmath100 and , due to mass conservation , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore the external axial magnetic field inhibits the ekman blowing ( which is completely suppressed when @xmath91 ) and makes the boundary layer thinner . the azimuthal flow @xmath101 , on the other hand , is forced to have different values at the boundaries and far away from them , thus the shear can be decreased only in the region close to the boundary .",
    "these results are in a good agreement with the linear solution  @xcite for the case of the infinite , rotating plate and @xmath72 ( the agreement for other quantities like @xmath100 , @xmath101 is pleasing as well ) .",
    "we notice that in the radially unbounded case . @xmath97 and @xmath98 are independent of @xmath7 which can not be true for the enclosed taylor - couette system .",
    "the values presented in fig .  [ fig : ehstruct ] are computed for @xmath102 , in the middle of the gap , so that the influence of the rotating cylinders is smallest .",
    "we point out that the induced axial current @xmath98 ( the hartmann current ) exists outside the boundary layer .",
    "this is not the case for non - rotating hartmann boundaries . for unbounded flow",
    "this current quickly converges to an asymptotic constant value , but for the case of flow between two plates , or for the enclosed cylinders , it can not be true and currents induced by both end - plates must eventually interact . when we consider a system symmetric in the @xmath99 direction , i.e.",
    ", when the two plates rotate in the same manner , the induced @xmath98 have the same strength but opposite signs and they eventually meet turning into the radial direction ( and consequently @xmath103 in the middle of the container for the symmetric boundary conditions ) .",
    "we have varied @xmath104 for constant @xmath105 , similarly we considered @xmath106 for @xmath107 to get values of the ekman / hartmann blowing and suction when the difference between cylinder and end - plates rotation is large .",
    "the agreement with previous nonlinear calculation for the infinite plate is quite good ,  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the induced mass flux and the current on the strength of the magnetic field as well as on the relative fluid / end - plate rotation has the same character .",
    "if the flow is vertically bounded by two plates , as for the taylor - couette system , three essentially different regions can be distinguished : the ekman - hartmann layer , a magnetic diffusion region and a current - free region  ( @xcite ) . in the magnetic diffusion region  ( mdr )",
    "the axial hartmann current must be reduced to zero before it reaches the current - free region and , by continuity , it is turned into radial direction . this radial perturbation current interacts with axial magnetic field and results in accelerating ( for negative @xmath108 and positive @xmath83 ) or decelerating ( for positive @xmath108 ) electromagnetic body force .",
    "the mdr arises since the ekman - hartmann layer itself is incapable to force the current to satisfy the exterior boundary conditions .",
    "it constantly grows in time and it quickly dominates the whole space between the plates .",
    "moreover , when considering the small @xmath38 limit , the mdr instantly becomes spatially uniform and infinitely thick even for one bounding plane and the current - free region does not exists at all ,  @xcite .",
    "consequently in our enclosed mhd taylor - couette system with @xmath109 we have relatively thin ekman - hartmann layer close to the plates , whereas the fluid in the major part of the container forms the mdr in which the axial hartmann current changes into radial one .",
    "we underline here that this is true for perfectly conducting walls , since such radial boundary conditions assure us that the current can penetrate the cylinders .",
    "the situation would be rather different with insulating radial boundaries .      for highly conducting plates",
    "the induced current drawn into / from the plates is much stronger than the current induced in the layer for insulating boundaries .",
    "the ekman - hartmann layer itself is nearly unaffected by conductivity of the plates as are the velocities and the currents within this layer . however , due to constant magnetic field perturbation there exists an additional electric current of order @xmath110 which is induced by the conducting boundaries , @xmath111 , and @xmath58 characterizes the relative conductance of the fluid and the thin plates ,  @xcite . moreover , in the mdr this current increases fluid velocity by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "figure [ fig : jrepslayer ] shows how the radial current @xmath108 in the middle of the container changes with conductivity of the end - plates .",
    "the difference between the perfect insulator and the perfect conductor is almost one order of magnitude even for so slow rotation .",
    "we find that for an mri experiment it is _ crucial to use insulating plates _ in order to minimize this undesirable current .",
    "we notice that the force due to the radial current and the axial magnetic field , @xmath113 , enters the momentum equation for @xmath101 component .",
    "formally the force is equivalent to applying an azimuthal pressure gradient @xmath114 . a flow between rotating cylinders with non - zero @xmath115 is usually referred as the taylor - dean flow ,  @xcite .",
    "its rotational profile @xmath116 is a superposition of the circular couette profile   and the steady flow @xmath117 with @xmath118 the pressure gradient can be realized by an external pumping mechanism or , like in the discussed case , by the lorentz force resulting from the induced current and the axial magnetic field .",
    "let us introduce a parameter @xmath119 describing taylor - dean flows , the ratio of average pumping velocity to the rotation velocity @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the average pumping velocity @xmath122 \\mathrm{d}r \\nonumber \\\\       & = & -\\partial_\\phi p \\frac{\\rout}{2 \\rho \\nu } \\frac { ( 1-\\etah^2)^2 - 4\\etah^2(\\ln{\\etah})^2 } { 4(1-\\etah)(1-\\etah^2 ) } , \\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "the basic question arises whether the resulting pumping due to the radial current and the axial field can bring the flow into an unstable regime .",
    "the structure of the ekman - hartmann layer changes with parameters such as rotation rates or strength of the magnetic field . here",
    ", however , we will concentrate on the flow in the bulk of the container so that only currents and velocities which leave the layer are important .",
    "we analyze hydrodynamically stable flow with @xmath123 at the aspect ratio @xmath13 with rigidly rotating end - plates .",
    "first we consider cylinders covered with rigid , perfectly conducting plates rotating with the angular velocity equal to that of the outer cylinder @xmath125 .",
    "we choose conducting lids so that the induced current is much stronger and its influence on the flow is more evident .    when the plates rotate with @xmath125 , the ekman circulation is clockwise and the corresponding hartman current has the positive sign , i.e. , close to the inner cylinder it leaves the ekman - hartmann layer with @xmath126 , consequently the radial current also has positive sign .",
    "figure  [ fig : lettersad ]  a - b displays a flow with conducting plates and a weak axial magnetic field applied , @xmath127 , for two different reynolds numbers .",
    "the rotation ratio is @xmath123 , so that the couette flow is hydrodynamically _ stable _ , however we notice that when @xmath2 is large enough the flow changes significantly and the taylor vortices can be observed .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained as follows : for a constant @xmath30 , increasing of the rotation rate leads to the stronger hartmann current drawn into the flow , therefore the corresponding pumping @xmath119 due to @xmath128 increases and for certain @xmath2 it reaches a critical value @xmath129 , so that the instability develops .",
    "if the perfectly conducting ends are replaced with insulating ones the induced current is much weaker . when the imposed magnetic field has strength such that @xmath127 , the pumping is too small to make the flow unstable , regardless of the reynolds number .",
    "however , when the magnetic field is stronger , @xmath130 , for sufficiently high rotation rates the vortices can also be seen , fig .",
    "[ fig : lettersad ]  c - d .",
    "it is known that stronger axial magnetic field has a stabilizing effect even on a hydrodynamically unstable flow  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "besides that , the hartmann current increases with the amplitude of the magnetic field only until a certain point is reached .",
    "when the magnetic interaction parameter becomes @xmath131 , increasing @xmath30 does not further increase the hartmann current ,  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons it is clear that when the imposed magnetic field is strong enough the instability described above will not occur .",
    "indeed , it has been checked that for conducting plates , @xmath132 and the magnetic field with @xmath133 there are no taylor vortices , although the rotational profile is significantly changed when compared to the non - magnetic situation .",
    "if rigidly conducting end - plates are attached to the inner cylinder , so that @xmath134 , the ekman circulation is counter - clockwise ( ekman suction ) and the corresponding hartmann current has a negative sign , so that the parameter @xmath119 is positive . from fig .",
    "[ fig : letterseh ]  e - f we see that , analogously to the case `` c''-``d '' , if the rotation is sufficiently fast the resulting @xmath119 reaches critical value and the flow becomes dominated by the vortices .",
    "similarly when the insulating plates are used , the axial magnetic field with @xmath127 is too weak to generate sufficiently large @xmath119 .",
    "when stronger field is applied , @xmath130 it is possible to observe the instability ( `` g''-``h '' ) .      as mentioned above ,",
    "if the induced radial current has the same sign as the axial magnetic field , the azimuthal velocity of the fluid is decelerated , if the signs are opposite the flow is accelerated .",
    "the discussed instability is a centrifugal one and is simply due to change in rotational profile of the fluid .",
    "let us use a rayleigh discriminant for stability , @xmath135 , the flow is stable if @xmath136 . fig .",
    "[ fig : zetoman ] shows the radial dependence of @xmath137 in the middle of the gap ( @xmath138 ) for the two cases labeled as `` b '' and `` f '' .",
    "we notice that the vortices concentrate in region where @xmath137 is negative , i.e. , where the rayleigh criterion is not fulfilled .",
    "this instability has essentially local character , so it is not possible to define any specific critical reynolds number whose crossing would lead to some exponential grow in the whole container . for the conducting plates and @xmath139",

    "an appropriate set of ten boundary conditions is needed in order to solve the system , these are the no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity @xmath148 and perfectly conducting for the magnetic field @xmath149 at the both cylinders .",

    "near the plates the ekman - hartmann layer forms and , consequently , there exists the hartmann current which penetrates bulk of the fluid . in the presence of an axial magnetic field such problem can be compared with the taylor - dean flow  a flow between , possibly rotating , cylinders which is additionally driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient .",
    "we find that under certain conditions the resulting flow becomes unstable , taylor vortices can be observed and the rotational profile is significantly different from the standard couette solution @xmath158 .",

    "<S> the fluid confined between the cylinders is assumed to be liquid metal characterized by small magnetic prandtl number , the cylinders are perfectly conducting , an axial magnetic field is imposed @xmath1 , the rotation rates correspond to @xmath2 of order @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the end - plates introduce , besides the well known ekman circulation , similar magnetic effects which arise for infinite , rotating plates , horizontally unbounded by any walls . </S>",
    "<S> in particular there exists the hartmann current which penetrates the fluid , turns into the radial direction and together with the applied magnetic field gives rise to a force . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the flow can be compared with a taylor - dean flow driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze stability of such flows and show that the currents induced by the plates can give rise to instability for the considered parameters . </S>",
    "<S> when designing an mhd taylor - couette experiment , a special care must be taken concerning the vertical magnetic boundaries so they do not significantly alter the rotational profile . </S>"
