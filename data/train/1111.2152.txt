    "in the present paper , we extend the statistical method , proposed by acharova et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for analysis of the radial distribution of oxygen in the galaxy milky way , to explain the nontrivial distribution of iron along the galactic disc , revealed in a series papers by andrievsky et al .",
    "( 2002 a , b , c ) and luck et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2006 ; 2011 ) .",
    "this problem is of great importance not only for the chemical evolution of the galactic disc and the history of star formation , but also for the search of independent restrictions on the models of supernovae , especially sne type ia ( sne ia ) whose outstanding role in discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe is well known ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "according to the cited papers of andrievsky , luck and their collaborators the spectroscopic study of heavy element abundances in cepheids demonstrate that , in the milky way , the radial distributions both oxygen and iron are to be described by a multi - slope function rather than by a linear one . for instance , the distribution of oxygen along the galactic disc is characterized by a steep gradient in the inner part of the disc for galactocentric radii 5 @xmath5 7 kpc and a plateau - like distribution for @xmath6 7 kpc and up to 10 kpc ( for the solar galactocentric distance @xmath7 the value 7.9 kpc is adopted ) , so that at @xmath8 7 kpc there is an inflection in the slope of the distribution .",
    "this fine structure of the radial distribution of oxygen was first explained by acharova et al .",
    "( 2005 a , b ) . for this",
    ", they took into account the influence of spiral arms since oxygen is mainly synthesized during explosions of sne type ii ( sne ii ) which are strongly concentrated in spiral arms . as it was shown in the last papers the combined effect of the corotation resonance and turbulent diffusion results in formation of the radial distribution of oxygen in the galactic disc with the bend in the slope .",
    "but some time ago it was difficult to explain the similar behavior of iron along the galactic radius by means of the same mechanism since it is generally agreed that @xmath0  70 % of iron is synthesized during sne ia explosions and only @xmath0  30 % is produced by sne ii ( matteucci 2004 ) .",
    "the point is that the progenitors of sne ia were thought to be of ages of the order of several billion years . before outbursts , after such a long period of time they have to be dispersed over a very large portion of the galactic disc ( mishurov & acharova 2011 ) .",
    "hence , if all precursors of sne ia would be old stars , they did not keep in their memory that they were born in spiral arms .",
    "so , we could not expect any noticeable influence of spiral arms on the radial distribution of iron unless to increase significantly the output of iron per one sne ii event which would entail serious consequences in the theory of pre sne ii evolution .",
    "the opportunity to solve simultaneously the problem of formation of the above fine structure in the radial distribution both oxygen and iron was offered when it has become evident that there exist two subpopulations of sne ia precursors   short - lived and long - lived . they were called ` prompt ' and ` tardy ' , respectively ( see , e.g. , mannucci et al .",

    "2008 ; brandt et al . 2010 ; maoz et al . 2011 ; li et al .",
    "acharova et al .",
    "( 2010 ) incorporated the results of mannucci et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and matteucci et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in their theory and explained the formation of the above fine structure of iron radial distribution in the galactic disc . besides , the discovery of the 2 subpopulations of sne ia enables to understand their concentration in spiral arms first revealed by bartunov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "nevertheless , several questions arise .",
    "first , to decompose the contributions of the above 3 sources to iron synthesis , acharova et al .",
    "( 2010 ) assume that sne ii and the two subpopulations of sne ia supply to the present ism approximately equal portions of iron . in a certain sense , it is a rather arbitrary supposition . however , the extension of the statistical method proposed by acharova et al .",
    "( 2011 ) enables to estimate the contributions to iron production from various types of sne independently of any preliminary suppositions .",
    "second , the estimations for ages of prompt progenitors of sne ia ( denote them as sne ia - p ) vary from @xmath0  100 myr and up to @xmath0  400 myr or even more , depending on used methods of data processing and observational material .",
    "can the radial distribution of iron along the galactic disc apply restriction on the age of sne ia - p precursors ?",
    "third , for the so - called ` dtd ' ( delay time distribution ) function were proposed two different approximations : a bimodal - like ( e.g. , mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ; matteucci et al . , 2006 ) and smooth one peaked at early times ( e.g. , maoz et al .",
    "how do such different representations for dtd function result in metallicity distribution along the galactic disc and the amount of iron synthesized by various types of sne ?",
    "the answer this question , perhaps , will impose additional constraints on the models of sne ia which have not been fully built , as yet .    at the time",
    ", the discussed discovery poses a problem for cosmology , as well . indeed ,",
    "if the population of sne ia is inhomogeneous , can we consider them as standard candles ( maeda et al .",
    "in any case to reach the necessary accuracy for constraining dark energy , one has to take into account some corrections which may depend on various parameters ( aubourg et al . 2008 ) .",
    "so , any additional constraints on metallicity production by various types of heavy elements sources may occur to be very useful .",
    "it is also important to notice that , in the present paper , we use new much more precise determinations of oxygen and iron abundances in cepheids .",
    "the chemical evolution of the galactic disc is governed by the following equations :    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the surface mass densities for oxygen and iron , respectively , @xmath13 is the gaseous density , @xmath14 is the fraction of the @xmath15th element ( oxygen or iron ) in ism , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the oxygen and iron abundances in the infall gas ( for the both elements we adopt @xmath18 : our experiments with various abundances of the infall gas from @xmath19 to @xmath20 show that the final abundances weakly depend on the exact value of @xmath21 if it is less than @xmath20 , see also lacey & fall 1985 .",

    "( 1,2 ) describe the turbulent diffusion of heavy elements with the diffusion coefficient @xmath48 . to estimate the coefficient we model the turbulent ism by a system of clouds and use the gas kinetic approach ( for details see mishurov et al .",
    "2002 ; acharova et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the enrichment rates @xmath49 of the ism by the @xmath15th heavy element due to sne ii explosions are described by the same expressions : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mean mass ( in solar units ) of ejected oxygen or iron per one sn ii explosion , @xmath52 is the rate of sneii events .",
    "the factor @xmath53 was introduced in order to take into account the influence of spiral arms .",
    "following the idea , first proposed by oort ( 1974 ) and used by portinari & chiosi ( 1999 ) and wyse & silk ( 1989 ) , we write    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the angular rotation velocity of the galactic disc , @xmath56 is the rotation velocity of the wave pattern responsible for the spiral arms , @xmath57 is a cutoff factor ( @xmath58 in the wave zone , i.e. between the inner and outer lindblad resonances , and @xmath59 beyond them ) , @xmath60 is a normalizing coefficient which we call as the constant for the rate of oxygen synthesis ( for details see mishurov et al .",
    "2002 ; acharova et al . 2005 ; 2010 ; 2011 ) .",
    "let us now turn to the synthesis of iron . in equation",
    "( 2 ) the rates of enrichment of the galaxy by iron due to sne ia - p and sne ia - t events are explicitly separated ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) .",
    "being young objects , sne ia - p are believed to be concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "hence , in addition to sne ii , they represent a complementary channel by means of which spiral arms influence the formation of multi - slope gradient of iron distribution in the disc .",
    "therefore , by analogy with the representation for the enrichment rates due to sne ii events , @xmath61 has to contain the factor @xmath53 .",
    "so , the contribution of sne ia - p to the enrichment rate of the galaxy by iron is governed by the following expressions : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a correction factor , @xmath65 and @xmath66 have the same sense as the corresponding quantities for the sne ii ,    @xmath67    @xmath68 is the dtd function for prompt sne ia , @xmath69 is the life - time for a star of mass @xmath70 .",
    "unlike prompt sne ia , sne ia - t do not concentrate in spiral arms since their precursors are long - lived objects .",
    "that is why the @xmath53-like factor is absent in the expression for @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the contribution to iron enrichment of the ism by tardy sne ia is described by the following formula : @xmath71 here unlike the above , @xmath72 is a constant since this type of subpopulation of sne ia is not concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "so , they do not keep in their memory that they were born in spiral arms .",
    "the corresponding rate for sne ia-  t events is represented as follows :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the dtd function for sne ia - t .",
    "let us specify , what we mean saying prompt sne ia . in mannucci",
    "2006 ) and matteucci et al .",
    "( 2006 ) model the prompt and tardy subpopulations of sne ia are clearly separated since their dtd function is _ bimodal _ : the first group of objects has the delay time @xmath75 , the second one corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "the critical time which serves as the boundary between the above subpopulations , @xmath77 , happens to be @xmath78 gyr [ more exactly @xmath79 yr @xmath80 gyr , matteucci et al .",
    "2006 ; see equations ( 7,8 ) and figure 2 therein ] .",
    "on the other hand , the above critical time @xmath81 gyr can be considered as a boundary delay time which divides prompt sne ia from tardy ones in the case of _ smooth _ dtd function , proposed , e.g. , by maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . indeed ,",
    "the typical time , necessary for a star to cross the interarm distance , is @xmath82  200 myr ( in the vicinity of the _ corotation resonance _ ,",
    "where @xmath83 , the crossing time @xmath84 ) .",
    "so , we may adopt that , if the age of sne ia progenitor ( i.e. , delay time @xmath85 ) is less than @xmath81 gyr the corresponding sne ia are concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "in other words , the objects belong to subpopulation sn ia - p .",
    "the above division is very important : as it will be shown below , the multi - slope gradient of iron distribution along the galactic disc may be explained by the influence of spiral arms only if a significant portion of sne ia is concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "hence , we believe that sne ia - p have to be sufficiently young , no older than @xmath0100 myr .    below we consider two types of approximating representations for the dtd function .",

    "it is seen that @xmath68 has a very sharp maximum at @xmath90 gyr due to the large parameter [ @xmath91 .",
    "so , the main contribution to the integral for @xmath66 brings the region of @xmath85 close to @xmath92 .",
    "hence , the integral may be estimated asymptotically by means of laplace method .",
    "\\2 ) _ smooth dtd",
    "_ function of maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in this model",
    "we use a power - like dtd function ( @xmath93 ) , proposed in the cited paper .",
    "however , we slightly modify it for small time , say , @xmath94 gyr assume @xmath95 to be proportional to @xmath96 ^ 2\\}$ ] in order to avoid the step - like behavior of it at early times . normalizing dtd to 1 within the time range from 20 myr to 18 gyr is dictated by the least mass ( @xmath00.8 m@xmath3 ) of a white dwarf companion in order the binary system results in sne ia outburst ( see greggio 2005 ; matteucci et al .",
    "so , there is no any contradiction with the shorter age of the universe . ] and suppose that dtd is a continuous function , finally we have : @xmath97 for @xmath98 gyr and @xmath99 ^ 2\\}$ ] for @xmath94 gyr .",
    "in this model , as sne ia - p we consider the stars for which the delay time @xmath100 myr .",
    "otherwise we refer the stars to sne ia - t .    as it was noticed in introduction , cepheids in our sample are very young : their ages usually do not exceed 100 myr ( see table 1 in appendix ) .",
    "so , they give the distribution of abundances in ism almost at present epoch . and it is important , since the above chemical equations describe the evolution of the abundances of heavy elements in ism . therefore , by means of our chemical equations we have to compute the theoretical distributions of oxygen and iron for the present moment of time @xmath101 gyr ( @xmath102 is the age of the galactic disc ) and compare the theoretical distributions with the observed ones . to do that we have to transform our final @xmath103 to metallicities : @xmath104^{\\rm th } = log(z_i / z_{i,\\odot})$ ] , where @xmath105 is the abundance of oxygen or iron for the sun .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath105 were adopted according to asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the fundamental feature of the above equations for the chemical evolution of the galactic disc is that they result in formation of the nontrivial radial distribution of the elements in the galactic disc . indeed , from the galactic density wave theory of lin et al .",
    "( 1969 ) it is known that the spiral wave pattern , responsible for spiral arms , rotates as a rigid body ( @xmath106 ) whereas the galactic matter rotates differentially ( the rotation velocity of the galactic disc @xmath107 is a function of the galactocentric distance @xmath108 ; to compute the rotation curve we use co data of clemens 1985 , adjusted them for @xmath109 kpc , see acharova et al .",
    "the radius @xmath110 , where both the velocities coincide [ @xmath111 , is called the _ corotation _ radius . from the above expression for @xmath53 it is obvious that in the vicinity of the corotation radius the enrichment of ism by sne ii and sne ia - p is depressed since here the difference @xmath112 .",
    "the combined effect of the corotation resonance and turbulent diffusion results in formation of the radial distribution of heavy elements with the slope which varies along the galactocentric radius .",
    "for completeness we also include in our theory the radial gas inflow within the galactic disc [ see the divergent terms in the last lines of equations ( 1,2 ) ] . for the radial velocity @xmath113",
    "we adopt the same model representations as in the paper by acharova et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    equations ( 1,2 ) are the ones in partial derivatives .",
    "so , besides the initial conditions ( at @xmath114 the initial values @xmath115 ) we adopt the so - called natural conditions of the finiteness of the solutions at the galactic center and at the galactic disc end , @xmath116 ( for models with radial gas inflow we locate the galactic end at @xmath117 kpc , in the case @xmath118 the value @xmath119 kpc is adopted ) .    strictly speaking the full system of equations for the galactic chemical evolution includes also the equations for the disc formation , which describe the exchange by mass among the intergalactic matter , gaseous and stellar components",
    "however , we do not write them since they and their solutions are the same as in acharova et al .",
    "( 2011 , see figure 1 therein ) .",
    "we only notice that according to the last paper , the short time - scale of the galactic disc formation , @xmath120 gyr , fits the best both to the observations of low present rate of gas infall on to the galactic disc , @xmath0  0.1 - 0.2 m@xmath3yr@xmath121 , and the star formation rate which is expected to be of the order of magnitude higher ( sancisi & fraternali 2008 , bregman 2009 , robitaille & whitney 2010 ) .",
    "so , for the galactic disc formation we adopt the results of acharova and collaborators [ the values of constants @xmath122 and @xmath24 for various models of inflow , i.e. @xmath113 , see in table 1 of their paper ] .",
    "the above system of equations for chemical evolution of the galaxy has 4 free parameters : @xmath60 , @xmath56 , @xmath64 and @xmath72 . to derive them we try to fit the theory to observations minimizing the merit function ( or discrepancy ) @xmath123",

    "we show that the process of the statistical treatment of observational data may be divided into two steps . indeed , as it was noticed in sec .",
    "2.1 we can neglect by the contribution of sne ia to oxygen synthesis . hence , the values @xmath56 and @xmath60 can be derived independently of other two target parameters @xmath64 and @xmath72 since the last 2 quantities do not enter the corresponding equations describing oxygen production .",
    "so , at _ step 1 _ we analyze the oxygen distribution to evaluate @xmath56 and @xmath60 . for this",
    ", we solve equations ( 1,3 - 7 ) for a set of @xmath56 and @xmath60 .",
    "after that we construct the surface @xmath123 as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath60 ( @xmath136 ) , find out the minimum of @xmath123 which determines the best values for the above parameters and compute the corresponding confidence contour for them .    at _ step 2 _ the radial distribution of iron is analyzed .",
    "now we seek for the last 2 free parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath72 .",
    "the idea for evaluation them is similar to the method used at the previous step , that is , we solve equations ( 2 - 11 ) , describing iron synthesis , for a set of @xmath64 and @xmath72 , consider @xmath56 and @xmath60 as have been derived at previous step , than compute the discrepancy between the theoretical and observed distributions of iron as a function of @xmath64 and @xmath72 , again construct the surface of @xmath123 , but now as a function of @xmath64 and @xmath72 , look for its minimum which gives the best values for @xmath64 and @xmath72 .",
    "however , at this step we have to take into account that the equations , describing the synthesis of iron , contain the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath60 , obtained independently at the previous step .",
    "therefore we have to take into account the influence of their errors on biases and errors in @xmath64 and @xmath72 . for this",
    ", we propose a kind of numerical experiment ( see sec .",
    "above we discussed the methods of estimation the statistical errors for the free parameters .",
    "but there is a source of errors which have another nature , namely : the uncertainties in oxygen and iron yields . as starting values , in our computations",
    ", we adopt the masses of oxygen and iron , ejected per one sn event , from tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 ( following matteucci et al .",
    "2006 , for the both sne ia subpopulations here we use the same ejected masses of iron ) . on the other hand , in literature one can find other values for the ejected masses ( see , e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 , thielemann 1996 and others )",
    "besides prompt and tardy sne ia may have different outputs of iron ( howell et al . 2009 ) .",
    "how do the changes in the ejected masses influence the final amounts of the elements supplied by various types of sne to the galactic disc ?    to feel the answer this question , first , let us look at the structure of the rate for oxygen enrichment : from equation ( 5 ) it is seen that @xmath140 enters the expression for @xmath141 as a product @xmath142 . similarly , the enrichment rate by iron due to sne ii explosion is proportional to the product @xmath143 .",
    "hence , if we adopt another value for @xmath144 , the constant @xmath60 will change , so that the product @xmath142 to be kept the same in order the final amount of oxygen to be unalterable . but this will influence the enrichment rate by iron due to sne ii even if @xmath145 is retained unchanged .    in turn ,",
    "the enrichment rates for iron by sne ia are proportional to products @xmath146 for prompt and @xmath147 for tardy objects [ see equations ( 8,10 ) ] .",
    "so , it is obvious , the variation in mass of oxygen ( ! ) , ejected during sne ii explosions , influences the output of iron due to sne ia - p , since the corresponding enrichment rates by iron for sne ii and sne ia - p have close functional representations along the galactic radius . but the amount of iron supplied by sne ia - t does not change . in other words , in this case , we should have a redistribution of amount of iron among the 3 sources of it .",
    "consider the second possible case : @xmath140 is equal to the starting value but @xmath145 is changed .",
    "hence , the enrichment rate @xmath61 has to be inversely changed in order to compensate the variation in the rate of iron enrichment due to sne ii , but again we do not expect any significant variations in the amount of iron synthesized by sne ia - t",
    ".    at last , in the third case , let us consider the result if @xmath148 for sne ia - p and sne ia - t are different , but other ejected masses are equal to the starting values .",
    "it is easy to see that the final amounts of iron supplied by all types of sne will not change at all .",
    "only constants @xmath64 and @xmath72 will alter in order the products @xmath149 and @xmath147 do not change relative to the starting case .    in sec .",
    "4 we illustrate the discussion of this problem by some results of our numerical experiments .    after evaluation of the free parameters we compute the amount of iron synthesized by each type of its sources .",
    "in the present paper , we use the most extensive spectroscopic ( only ) data on oxygen and iron abundances derived for classical 283 cepheids ( 872 spectra in total ) .",
    "a part of the data were previously published ( @xcite and references therein ) . for completeness",
    "we give the data in table 1 ( see appendix ) .",
    "below we describe briefly our methods and analysis of spectra .",
    "the spectra of additional cepheids were obtained using the facilities of the 1.93 m telescope at the haute - provence observatoire ( france ) equipped with chelle - spectrograph elodie . in the region of wavelengths",

    "also we use chelle - spectrograph sophie at this telescope , the spectra stretch from 3870 to 6940 in 39 orders with resolution r=75000 .",

    "the spectra were reduced using a python - based pipe - line , following a procedure of the order extraction , wavelength calibration using thr - ne - ar arcs , division by the flat field , cosmic - ray clipping , and the order merging . for more details on the spectrograph and the pipe - line",

    "the spectral resolution is about 80000 , and for most of the spectra the typical s / n ratio is 150200 .    further processing of the spectra ( continuum level location , measurement of the equivalent widths , etc . ) was performed using the software package dech20 ( galazutdinov 1992 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured using the gaussian fitting .",
    "effective temperatures for our program stars were established from the processed spectra using the method developed by @xcite that is based upon @xmath152line depth relations .",

    "it relies upon the ratio of the central depths of two lines that have very different functional dependences on @xmath152 , and uses tens of pairs of lines for each spectrum .",
    "the method is independent of interstellar reddening , and only marginally dependent on the individual characteristics of stars , such as rotation , microturbulence , metallicity , etc .",
    "the microturbulent velocities , @xmath153 , and surface gravities , @xmath154 , were derived using a modification of the standard analysis proposed by @xcite . as described there , the microturbulence is determined from the fe  ii lines rather than the fe  i lines , as in classical abundance analyses .",
    "the surface gravity is established by forcing equality between the total iron abundance obtained from both fe  i and fe  ii lines . typically with this method",

    "the increase followed by the decrease in its content between 13 and 15 kpc takes place at approximately the same distance that of for oxygen although it is not so prominent and the both radial patterns differ in details . for instance , there is no noticeable variation in iron distribution at @xmath170 kpc where in oxygen distribution we see a rather sharp step - like decrease . in our opinion , the above peculiarities may be associated with some local effects , say , with a sudden fall of a pristine gas on to the galactic disc at @xmath171 kpc or due to the magellanic stream at @xmath172 kpc .",
    "however , we will not try to explain them : in spite of our model is difficult from the mathematical point of view such local effects can not be simply incorporated in our theory .",
    "that is why for the statistical analysis we restrict ourselves by the region @xmath173 kpc .",
