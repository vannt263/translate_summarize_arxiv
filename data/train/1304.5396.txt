    "in recent years warm atomic ensembles have been widely used in many applications in quantum optics and atomic physics .",
    "the most promising applications include quantum repeaters @xcite , quantum memories @xcite and ultraprecise magnetometry @xcite .",
    "they have also been shown to be an effective medium for four - wave mixing processes @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite and slow light generation @xcite .",
    "an advantage of using warm atomic gas is undoubtedly simplicity of performing experiments and obtaining large optical depths .",
    "however , it entails fast thermal motion of atoms .",
    "atomic motion limits the efficiency of many modern systems that use multimode properties of atomic ensembles .",
    "at best this motion can be slowed down and made diffusive by addition of a suitable buffer gas . since diffusion is usually the main source of decoherence in multimode vapor memory systems , ability to measure and control its speed",
    "is highly desired .",
    "in particular it would be very useful to distinguish pure diffusional decoherence from other decoherence effects .",
    "there is a number of currently developing systems where diffusion is the main limitation .",
    "an important example of such a system is storing and retrieving transverse modes and images in gradient echo memory @xcite , in collective raman scattering @xcite or in eit @xcite .",
    "typically diffusional motion of atoms in a buffer gas limits the storage time @xcite , restricts the number of spatial modes retrieved @xcite or broadens the eit spectrum @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the exact diffusion coefficient is particularly important for designing experiments with diffraction cancellation @xcite .",
    "further progress would be significantly facilitated if one possessed convenient , robust and repeatable method for precise diagnostic of decoherence in the actual cell of a particular setup .",
    "however , the available methods of measuring diffusion decoherence are indirect and require either variation of buffer gas pressure , prior knowledge of other sources of decoherence @xcite or setup alterations within a single measurement @xcite .",
    "this makes them unsuitable for modern experiments where exact knowledge of diffusional decoherence of a single sealed glass cell in a specific setup is required .",
    "here we propose a novel , direct method which allows us to measure the diffusion in any given cell .",
    "the measurement provides more than enough data to verify its self - consistency and single out the diffusion from other motion - independent sources of decoherence .",
    "the method should be relatively easy to incorporate into a number of quantum memory setups .    as a demonstration we measure the diffusion coefficients of rubidium in neon , krypton and xenon in sealed glass cells at a pressure of a few torrs .",
    "these results will be useful for designing future experiments , since the data available till now is rather scarce and , most importantly , it was retrieved using indirect methods @xcite .",
    "the data available for neon is inconsistent and that for krypton is hardly available @xcite .",
    "we also recommend using xenon as a buffer gas , for which we provide the very first experimental data as far as we know . despite the latest applications of hyperpolarized xenon @xcite ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient of rubidium in this gas has only been deduced from cross sections of velocity changing collisions @xcite or interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the principles of our method , sec .",

    "act as diffraction gratings deflecting laser beam at different angles .",
    "( b ) components of high periodicity are blurred faster due to diffusion , therefore the intensity of deflected light will decay faster for higher angles of deflection . during storage time @xmath1 ,",
    "the pattern component of specific periodicity corresponding to the wave vector @xmath2 blurs with decay rate @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "[ fig : blurr],width=302 ]      quantification of the diffusive motion of atoms using optical methods can be done in three general steps . at first a group of atoms",
    "has to be chosen and distinguished from others by changing their internal state .",
    "then the atoms are let to spread due to diffusion in the absence of light . in the third stage one",
    "probes the group and observes the effects of the spread .",
    "this general scheme has various implementations @xcite which typically consisted in exciting and probing a pencil - shaped atomic group using light beams .",
    "instead here we create and , after a certain delay , probe patterns of spatially dependent atomic coherence @xmath5 between two long lived atomic levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "patterns of atomic coherence are created through spontaneous ( stokes ) raman scattering .",
    "each pattern comprises many plane - wave components with different periodicities .",
    "those components decay at different rates due to diffusive motion of the atoms . after a certain storage time relative contribution of each plane - wave component",
    "can be measured by driving the anti - stokes scattering .",
    "then each plane - wave component acts as a diffraction grating deflecting driving laser beam as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : blurr ] ( a ) . by measuring the intensity of the anti - stokes scattering light as a function of deflection angle and time between pattern creation and readout",
    ", we can calculate the decay rate of different plane - wave components constituting atomic coherence .",
    "we rely on the fact that in the diffusion process periodic patterns of atomic coherence does not change their period but they are blurred over time as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : blurr ] ( b ) .",
    "as atoms move , coherence at a specific point @xmath8 will reshuffle its values with the neighboring points .",
    "evolution of atomic coherence in the dark will be described by the equation of diffusion with a coefficient @xmath4 and homogeneous depolarization with a rate @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 this equation can be readily solved in fourier domain : @xmath11    evolution of each plane wave component of initial amplitude @xmath12 and wave vector @xmath13 is described by a simple exponential decay at a rate @xmath14 . as long as the evolution of @xmath15 can be described by eq . with position - independent homogeneous depolarization with a rate @xmath9 ,",
    "the measurement of decay rates @xmath16 is sufficient to calculate @xmath4 as a coefficient of the quadratic term of @xmath16 .",
    "is created in spontaneous stokes scattering .",
    "( b ) the difference between wave vectors of laser field * @xmath17 * and the scattering field component * @xmath18 * is stored in the spatially dependent phase of the atomic coherence .",
    "( c ) atomic coherence can be converted back to light in anti - stokes scattering .",
    "( d ) the atomic coherence phase is imprinted on anti - stokes scattering as momentum conservation . unlike the stokes process ,",
    "anti - stokes scattering deterministically retrieves created coherence pattern on demand .",
    "[ fig : levels],width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels](a ) we illustrated the atomic levels involved in stokes scattering leading to creation of coherence @xmath5 between levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 . upon spontaneous scattering of a laser beam",
    "detuned from the @xmath19 transition both scattered light and atomic coherence are created .",
    "we shall consider a simple case where the laser beam and the scattered light are planewaves with wave vectors , * @xmath17 * and * @xmath18 * , respectively .",
    "the difference between the laser field wave vector @xmath17 and the created photons wave vector @xmath18 is accumulated in atoms as a spatial phase of atomic coherence . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels](b ) the atomic coherence created will be of a form @xmath20 , where * @xmath21*.    such periodic atomic coherence @xmath5 can work as a diffraction grating and deflect a laser beam .",
    "this is realized in anti - stokes scattering process presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels](c ) in which laser beam detuned from the @xmath22 transition is scattered at an angle .",
    "the spatial phase of atomic coherence @xmath5 is imprinted back onto the scattered photons as follows from bragg condition .",
    "provided driving laser beam is the plane wave with a wave vector @xmath23 , the diffracted light wave vector will be @xmath24 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels](d ) . therefore by observing the intensity of the light @xmath25 scattered at an angle @xmath26",
    ", we register a signal which is proportional to the modulus square of the corresponding plane wave component of atomic coherence @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .      spatially varying atomic coherence @xmath5",
    "is created in a spontaneous stokes scattering process , which populates various planewave components randomly .",
    "nonetheless , the average modulus square of the excitation amplitude @xmath29 created right after the scattering is set by the driving pulse parameters and can be kept constant between measurement series .",
    "therefore , we can calculate the average intensity of the light scattered at a certain angle @xmath30 and for a given storage time @xmath1 , incorporating eq .",
    ":    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is efficiency of readout , _ a priori _ dependent on @xmath13 .",
    "the only factor that depends on the diffusion time @xmath1 is the intensity decay factor @xmath33 , which provides direct information about the decay rate @xmath16 .",
    "therefore for a given angle of observation @xmath30 we can infer @xmath16 from an exponential fit to a series of experimental data taken for successive @xmath1 .    by repeating the decay fits for many @xmath13 we can gather and then fit the expected functional dependence @xmath34 to obtain the diffusional coefficient @xmath4 . in principle , we could use only two measurements of decay rates @xmath35 corresponding to just two different directions . note that thanks to a particular way of populating spatially varying atomic coherence we create and probe many wave vectors concurrently without altering the setup .",
    "thence we obtain many points corresponding to a broad span of @xmath13 vectors in a single measurement sequence , which provides for a robust quadratic fit of @xmath16 .",
    "the quality and reliability of the experimental data is directly reflected in this last fit .",
    "so far we have assumed the driving beam to be a planewave .",
    "the finite size @xmath36 of the driving laser beam in anti - stokes scattering results in limited resolution in probing a wave vector space",
    ". the angular spread of the laser beam driving the readout will be transferred onto the angular distribution of the scattered light due to momentum conservation even for planewave atomic coherence @xmath5 .",
    "thus for any specific angle of observation @xmath30 we detect the scattered light originating from several distinct fourier components of the atomic coherence pattern .",
    "the contribution will come from the component of the wave vector @xmath13 and its vicinity to the spread @xmath37 .",
    "we expect the spread @xmath37 to be of the order of the inverse of the driving laser beam size @xmath38 .",
    "the result of the limited resolution is an overall increase in the decay rates observed @xmath39 .",
    "it can be estimated by convolving the storage time - dependent fourier distribution of atomic coherence @xmath5 with a gaussian of a spread @xmath37 , yielding :    @xmath40    note that the term quadratic in @xmath13 in the above formula did not change , therefore the procedure of obtaining the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 remains unchanged .",
    "we only have to assure that the term @xmath41 is small as compared to @xmath42 .",
    "this can be done by increasing the beam size @xmath36 .    in conclusion",
    "all measurements can be completed by varying only one parameter ",
    "the diffusion time @xmath1 equal to laser pulse separation while collecting scattered light on a camera .",
    "data analysis require three straightforward steps : averaging , exponential fit and eventually quadratic fit to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "this makes the whole procedure relatively quick and simple to repeat .      in eq .",
    "we assumed that decoherence could be divided into two types : the @xmath13-dependent diffusional type and the homogenous type .",
    "the latter originates mostly from atomic collisions .",
    "this division applies sufficiently to typical experimental conditions ; however , other types of processes may contribute to decoherence as well .    in eq .",
    "we neglected the stray magnetic field .",
    "taking such a field into account would require introducing an extra term in eq .",
    ": @xmath43 to represent additional , space - dependent build - up of the phase , where @xmath44 is the magnetic moment for the @xmath45-th level .",
    "nevertheless , we estimated that our final results would change only by 10% in the presence of a magnetic field gradient of 0.5 gauss / mm or with a quadratically changing magnetic field of 10 mgauss / mm@xmath46 these values are considerably higher than in normal experimental conditions even without applying magnetic shielding .",
    "we also noted that decoherence due to spin - exchange collisions might lead to quite complicated effects if @xmath5 was a fast varying function of position .",
    "these collisions could alter the state of the atoms at a different rate and at different points in space , leading to a nontrivial space dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "we calculated the rate of these collisions to be of the order of 1.5 khz , which is negligible as compared to the diffusional decay caused by the atoms leaving the laser beams .",

    ". therefore we can extract diffusion coefficients by measuring decay rates for different periodicities of different components of spatially varying atomic coherence .",
    "distinct components are conveniently mapped on different angles of the scattered light which enables observations with a camera in the far field .",
    "our method does not require any setup alterations within the measurement .",
