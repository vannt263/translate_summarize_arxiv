    "discrete breathers ( dbs ) or intrinsic localized modes , are time - periodic and spatially localized excitations that may be produced generically in discrete arrays of weakly coupled nonlinear elements @xcite .",
    "a large body of theoretical work has produced means of precise numerical analysis of coupled oscillator systems with breathers both in the hamiltonian as well as dissipative regimes  @xcite .",
    "breathers have been experimentally observed in several diverse systems , including optical waveguides systems @xcite , solid - state systems @xcite , antiferromagnetic chains @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , and micromechanical oscillators @xcite , among others .",
    "discrete breathers can be generated spontaneously in a lattice either through stochastic mechanisms @xcite or by purely deterministic mechanisms @xcite in a process by which energy , initially evenly distributed in a nonlinear lattice , can be localized into large amplitude nonlinear excitations .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite that the standard modulational instability ( mi ) mechanism in dissipative systems driven by an alternating term can initiate that process by the formation of low - amplitude breathers .",
    "the energy exchange between those low - amplitude dbs favors the higher - amplitude ones , resulting eventually in the formation of a few high - amplitude dbs .",
    "a few years ago a whole new class of artificially structured materials , referred to as metamaterials , was discovered ; the latter are comprised of discrete elements and exhibit electromagnetic properties not available in naturally occurring materials .",
    "a subclass of those metamaterials , the magnetic metamaterials ( mms ) , exhibit significant magnetic properties and sometimes even negative magnetic response up to terahertz ( thz ) and optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "the most common realization of a mm is composed of periodically - arranged electrically small sub - wavelength particles , referred to as split - ring resonators ( srrs ) @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "each of those resonators is just a highly conducting metallic ring with one slit .",
    "the mm thus built can become nonlinear either by the insertion of a nonlinear dielectric @xcite or a nonlinear electronic component ( e.g. , a varactor diode ) @xcite in the slit of each srr , resulting in voltage - dependent srr capacitance . in microwave frequencies ,",
    "such a mm has been realized @xcite and is dynamically tunable by varying the input power .",
    "the combination of nonlinearity and the discreteness that is inherent in those metamaterials , makes possible the generation of nonlinear excitations in the form of dbs . the existence and stability of dbs in nonlinear srr - based mm models , that are localized either in the bulk @xcite or at the surface @xcite of the mm , have been demonstrated numerically .",
    "moreover , domain walls @xcite and envelope solitons @xcite may also be excited in such systems .",
    "the surface dbs in mms are very similar with the surface modes observed in discrete waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel mm comprised of two types of srrs was investigated theoretically @xcite , and it was demonstrated that in the nonlinear regime such binary mms are perfectly suited for the observation of phase - matched parametric interaction and enhanced second harmonic generation ( shg ) . in the present work",
    "we extend the previous studies on db generation in model srr - based mms to the case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) binary mm with on - site cubic nonlinearity . in practice",
    ", a binary mm can be constructed in many different ways , by changing for example one or more of the material and/or the geometrical parameters of the srrs belonging to one type ( say type @xmath0 ) , with respect to the same parameters of the srrs belonging to the other type ( say type @xmath1 ) .",
    "here we allow for different slit - widths for the two types of srrs , which makes their resonance frequencies differ by a factor that we call resonance frequency mismatch ( rfm ) .",
    "the considered binary mm is formed by type @xmath0 srrs at the even - numbered sites and type @xmath1 srrs at the odd - numbered sites of a periodic 1d array . in the next section",
    "we give the model equations that describe the dynamics of the binary mm and we obtain the corresponding linear dispersion relation for magnetoinductive waves in that medium @xcite . in sections iii and iv we construct , using the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , several types of hamiltonian and dissipative breathers ( ddbs ) , respectively .",
    "the dynamic stability of those dbs is discussed in section v where the full model equations are integrated numerically . in most of the investigated cases",
    "the numerics confirm the quality of the rwa results .",
    "moreover , in that section we also demonstrate the spontaneous generation of ddbs induced by mi , using frequency chirping of the driving field .",
    "that procedure has been used in actual experiments for the generation of high - amplitude ddbs in micromechanical cantilever oscillator arrays @xcite , and perhaps it could be also used in similar experiments involving nonlinear binary mms .",
    "we finish in section vi with the conclusions .",
    "consider a 1d srr - based mm comprised of nonlinear units shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . each nonlinear srr in the array can be mapped to a nonlinear resistor - inductor - capacitor ( rlc ) circuit featuring self - inductance @xmath2 , ohmic resistance @xmath3 , and nonlinear ( voltage - dependent ) capacitance @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the field - dependent permittivity of the infilling dielectric , @xmath6 is the electric field , and @xmath7 is the electric field induced along the srr slit .",
    "we assume that the latter originates from an alternating magnetic field that is applied to the mm perpendicularly to the srr planes , and it is proportional to the voltage @xmath8 across the slit .",

    "thus , the linear capacitances of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 srrs become respectively @xmath31 and @xmath32 , resulting in different resonance frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "now let us return to the nonlinear problem , and assume that the slits of all the srrs in the array are filled with a kerr - type dielectric .",
