    "already several years ago , the cdf collaboration at the fermilab tevatron extracted individual cross sections for the inclusive production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons originating from decays of @xmath6 mesons and other @xmath5 hadrons @xcite .",
    "the cross sections were differential in the charmonium transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) and covered the range 5  gev@xmath8  gev .",
    "next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) predictions provided by two of us @xcite were found to nicely reproduce these measurements over the whole @xmath7 range .",
    "the calculation had two ingredients , the inclusive production cross section of the process @xmath9 , differential in @xmath7 and rapidity ( @xmath10 ) , and the partial widths of the inclusive decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 as functions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 momentum fractions , respectively .",
    "the first ingredient was calculated at nlo in the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) @xcite , which corresponds to the conventional parton - model approach endowed with nonperturbative fragmentation function ( ffs ) for the transition @xmath13 , as described in ref .  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the @xmath5 quark is included among the incoming partons , along with the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 quarks and the gluon @xmath18 , leading to additional contributions .",
    "previous cdf measurements of the inclusive @xmath19 production cross section at center - of - mass energy @xmath20  tev @xcite were found to be in satisfactory agreement with such nlo zm - vfns predictions , provided that realistic ffs are adopted @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient was obtained in the framework of the parton model in combination with nonrelativistic - qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization @xcite by applying the approach of palmer , paschos , and soldan @xcite to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decay distributions measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the inclusive cross section of nonprompt @xmath0 hadroproduction at tevatron energies was also computed in the fonll and mc@nlo approaches @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration repeated their measurement of the inclusive cross section of nonprompt @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite hadroproduction in run  ii ( cdf  ii ) at @xmath21  tev with a much higher accuracy reaching also below @xmath22  gev .",
    "recently , all four lhc experiments , cms @xcite , lhcb @xcite , atlas @xcite , and alice @xcite , released their measurements of the corresponding @xmath0 @xcite , and @xmath1 @xcite observables in @xmath3 collisions with @xmath23  tev .",
    "these data offer the opportunity to test the @xmath5-hadron production models in a new energy regime using the common decay channels to @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .    in this paper , we present a new analysis of the inclusive cross sections of nonprompt @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadroproduction with theoretical input improved relative to our previous work  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the zm - vfns is replaced by the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) , which has been elaborated in recent years @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we adopt an updated @xmath13 ff extracted @xcite from more recent data of @xmath24 at the @xmath25-boson resonance @xcite as well as state - of - the - art parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite . on the other hand , the formalism for the description of the inclusive decays @xmath26 and @xmath27 is taken over from ref .",
    "@xcite without changes , since it is still quite appropriate . to gain confidence in the reliability of our nlo treatment of inclusive @xmath6-meson production",
    ", we performed comparisons @xcite with cdf  ii data from @xmath2 collisions at @xmath21  tev @xcite and with cms data from @xmath3 collisions at @xmath23  tev @xcite , to find very good agreement , in particular for larger @xmath7 values . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the polarization of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons from @xmath5-hadron decay was not considered . according to the leading - order ( lo ) nrqcd analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is small in both cases , which is in line with the measurement by the cdf collaboration @xcite , but in mild contrast to the one by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , we briefly describe our theoretical framework and choice of inputs , pointing towards the appropriate references . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , we compare our nlo gm - vfns predictions for the inclusive cross sections of nonprompt @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadroproduction with recent measurements at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite . section  [ sec : four ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the technical details of the gm - vfns framework and results obtained from it were previously presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we only describe our choice of input for the numerical analysis of nonprompt @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadroproduction .",
    "we use the set cteq6.6 @xcite of proton pdfs as implemented in the lhapdf library @xcite .",
    "this pdf set was obtained in a general - mass scheme using the input values @xmath28  gev , @xmath29  gev , and @xmath30 , and taking the starting scale of the @xmath5-quark pdf to be @xmath31 .",
    "we employ the nonperturbative @xmath6-meson ffs determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting experimental data on the inclusive cross section of @xmath6-meson production in @xmath4 annihilation taken by the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations at cern lep1 and by the sld collaboration @xcite at slac slc .",
    "these ffs supersede the ones extracted from opal data @xcite in ref .",
    "all these data were taken on the @xmath25-boson resonance , so that finite-@xmath32 effects can safely be neglected . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymptotic scale parameter was taken to be @xmath33  gev at nlo , the factorization and renormalization scales were identified with the @xmath25-boson mass , @xmath34 , and the starting scale of the @xmath13 ff was chosen to be @xmath35 in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , while the @xmath36 ffs , where @xmath37 , were assumed to vanish at @xmath38 .",
    "we select the ff set implemented with the simple power ansatz , which yielded the best fit , as may be seen in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "the opal @xcite and sld @xcite data included all the @xmath5-hadron final states , i.e.  all the @xmath6 mesons , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , and the @xmath5 baryons , such as the @xmath42 baryon , while , in the aleph analysis @xcite , only final states with identified @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons were taken into account . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ffs of all @xmath5 hadrons were assumed to have the same shape .",
    "in addition , we shall assume here that all the @xmath5 hadrons have the same branching fractions and decay distributions into @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons as the @xmath6 mesons .",
    "differences only arise from the different @xmath5-quark to @xmath5-hadron branching fractions , which we adopt from the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath40-meson contribution is to be multiplied by @xmath43 . for simplicity , we take the initial- and final - state factorization scales , entering the pdfs and ffs , respectively , to have the same value @xmath44 .",
    "we choose @xmath44 and the renormalization scale @xmath45 , at which @xmath46 is evaluated , to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , where @xmath49 with @xmath7 being the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 mesons , and independently vary the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 about their default values @xmath52 up and down by a factor of two under the restriction @xmath53 to estimate the theoretical uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge of beyond - nlo corrections .",
    "in fact , scale variations constitute the overwhelming source of theoretical uncertainties in our predictions .",
    "we may , therefore , neglect the uncertainties in the pdfs and @xmath32 . for consistency with ref .",
    "@xcite , we use @xmath29  gev throughout this work . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employ an effective ff for the transition of parton @xmath54 via the @xmath6 meson to the @xmath0 meson , which is calculated as the convolution @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the nonperturbative ffs at @xmath6-to-@xmath54 longitudinal - momentum fraction @xmath10 and factorization scale @xmath44 , as determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath57 is the @xmath6-meson total decay width , and @xmath58 is the @xmath59 decay distribution differential in the @xmath0-to-@xmath6 longitudinal - momentum fraction @xmath60 , as given in eqs .",
    "( 3.12 ) or ( 3.16 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . for given @xmath0 transverse momentum @xmath7 and rapidity @xmath10 ,",
    "the modulus of the @xmath6 three - momentum @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "we use the @xmath19 average mass value @xmath63  gev and average lifetime value @xmath64  ps . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the decay distribution @xmath65 in the component @xmath66 of the @xmath0 three - momentum parallel to @xmath61 is obtained by integrating the general formula , given in eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , over the orthogonal three - momentum components .",
    "this leads to the quantity @xmath58 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff ] ) , where @xmath67 .",
    "it depends on the structure function @xmath68 of the @xmath13 transition , the element @xmath69 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , and the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath5 , which in turn depend on the short - distance coefficients of the weak - interaction hamiltonian of the @xmath71 transition and the relevant @xmath0 long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) of nrqcd as specified in eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ldmes were fitted at lo in nrqcd to the inclusive cross section of direct @xmath0 hadroproduction measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite and the @xmath11 branching fraction measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the resulting prediction for the @xmath11 three - momentum distribution was found @xcite to be in reasonable agreement with the cleo measurement @xcite .",
    "the latter also nicely agrees with the babar measurement @xcite , which was not yet available for the fit @xcite .",
    "recently , nrqcd factorization has been impressively consolidated at nlo @xcite by a global fit @xcite to the world data on the unpolarized @xmath0 yields in hadroproduction , photoproduction , two - photon scattering , and @xmath4 annihilation .",
    "the @xmath0 ldmes of refs .",
    "@xcite agree in magnitude typically within a factor of three and in sign .",
    "as for the color - octet ldmes , the lo values of ref .  @xcite overshoot the respective nlo values of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is in line with the observation @xcite that the nlo corrections generally enhance the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 hadroproduction .",
    "we conclude that an update of the nrqcd analysis of the @xmath11 three - momentum distribution would essentially reproduce the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , the more so as the modelling of this decay distribution is almost irrelevant , at least at large values of @xmath7 , where the fine details are effectively washed out by the lorentz boost from the @xmath6-meson rest frame to the laboratory frame of the hadron collider @xcite and the @xmath11 branching fraction becomes the key parameter .",
    "nevertheless , we must bear in mind that nrqcd factorization is presently challenged at nlo @xcite by lhc and tevatron measurements of @xmath0 polarization observables . for a very recent review",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "besides direct @xmath0 production via @xmath11 , we also included the feed - down contributions from @xmath72 with @xmath73 followed by @xmath74 and from @xmath12 followed by @xmath75 .",
    "the branching fraction of the direct channel was found to be 0.80% , while those of the cascades via the @xmath76 and @xmath1 mesons were found to be 0.13% and 0.19% , respectively .",
    "alternative lo - nrqcd analyses of the direct @xmath11 branching fraction , based on different @xmath0 ldme sets , yield values in the same ball park , namely 0.65% @xcite and 0.77% @xcite .",
    "further details may be found in ref .",
    "since the appearance of the cleo paper @xcite , some of these input values have changed slightly . however",
    "the most relevant result , namely the total @xmath11 branching fraction , goes unchanged , if up - to - date input data from the pdg @xcite is used . to facilitate the calculation",
    ", we evaluate @xmath58 using its asymptotic expression , obtained from eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "this approximation deviates from the exact result by less than 11% and 5% for @xmath78  gev and 20  gev , respectively . in most of our applications ,",

    "we are now in a position to present our numerical analysis . in figs .  [",
    "fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] , we compare measurements of the inclusive cross sections of nonprompt @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite hadroproduction , respectively , with our nlo gm - vfns predictions evaluated as described in sec .",

    "[ sec : two ] .",
    "the slight changes of slope in the lower bounds at about @xmath89  gev reflect the fact that the partonic subprocesses initiated by a @xmath5 quark are turned off by the @xmath5-quark pdf as the threshold at @xmath90 is reached .",

    "<S> we study the inclusive production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons originating from the decays of bottom - flavored hadrons produced in @xmath2 collisions at the fermilab tevatron and in @xmath3 collisions at the cern lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we work at next - to - leading order in the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) implemented with nonperturbative fragmentation functions fitted to @xmath4 data of inclusive @xmath5-hadron production exploiting their universality . </S>",
    "<S> the three - momentum distributions of the charmonia used were extracted from @xmath6-decay data in the framework of nonrelativistic - qcd factorization . comparing the theoretical predictions thus obtained with transverse - momentum distributions measured by the cdf  ii , alice , atlas , cms , and lhcb collaborations </S>",
    "<S> , we find excellent overall agreement as for both absolute normalization and lineshape , which provides a nontrivial test of the gm - vfns over wide ranges of center - of - mass energy , transverse momentum , and rapidity . </S>"
