    "our main tool of analysis is a result attributed to jordan @xcite , a more modern version of which can be found in @xcite . the result states that any two projectors @xmath69 and @xmath18 on an @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space can be put in a simultaneous block - diagonal form , with blocks of size at most 2 .",
    "clearly , the operators @xmath72 and @xmath83 share the same spectrum @xmath84 , bounded between 0 and 1 ( this can be seen by left and right polar decomposition of the operator @xmath85 ) .",
    "their respective eigenvectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in general different however . since @xmath69 and @xmath18 are purely contractive , it follows that if @xmath88 for some @xmath89 , then the basis can be chosen such that @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath91 , then either @xmath92 or @xmath93 . for the intermediate values @xmath94",
    ", jordan found that we can group the remaining eigenvectors in pairs that we denote @xmath95 and @xmath96 such that @xmath97 with the property that @xmath98 and @xmath99 . by enlarging the dimension of the hilbert space ( at most doubling its dimension ) and allowing @xmath100 to take the values 0 and 1",
    ", we can assume that all eigenstates of @xmath72 and @xmath83 are paired up in this fashion , so that both sets @xmath101 and @xmath102 are complete orthonormal bases .",
    "the naive algorithm to approximate the ground state of a local hamiltonian consists of using phase estimation to mark the low - energy eigenstates of @xmath2 , and then integrating this marking procedure in grover s algorithm to produce a state of low energy .",
    "this strategy can easily be analyzed with the help of jordan s result .",
    "indeed , let @xmath69 be the projector onto the all - zero state of the @xmath29 auxiliary qubits used by phase estimation and @xmath18 be the projector on the output of the phase estimation indicating an energy less than @xmath15 .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the unitary evolution @xmath103 can not be realized perfectly in general , but this is a source of error that can be ignored because it does nt build up during grover s algorithm .",
    "thus , we will assume here that the phase estimation algorithm implements @xmath104 exactly .",
    "in this language , the state @xmath105 corresponds to a state of the form @xmath106 where @xmath30 is an eigenstate of @xmath2 with energy @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath73 of @xmath72 associated to that state is equal to the probability that the phase estimation algorithm diagnoses @xmath30 as having an energy less than @xmath15 .",
    "this is where the finite success probability of the phase estimation algorithm comes into play .",
    "the important point is that even if the energy @xmath33 is well below or well above @xmath15 , there is a small probability that the algorithm will give the wrong answer .",
    "the effect is more pronounced when the actual energy of @xmath33 is close to the acceptance threshold @xmath15 , but it is the small error probabilities that will really cause a problem .",
    "the error is zero only when @xmath33 can be expressed exactly in binary form with @xmath29 bits . thus , unless very detailed knowledge of the spectrum of @xmath2 is available , these small errors are unavoidable .",
    "continuing with the naive algorithm , we prepare a random superposition @xmath107 , i.e. a random state of the @xmath12 system qubits with the @xmath29 auxiliary qubits in state 0 , and use grover s algorithm to amplify the image of @xmath18 .",
    "this results in the state @xmath108 we see that , as a consequence of the amplification of @xmath18 , the state @xmath109 is no longer supported only on the image of @xmath69 as indicated by the presence of the @xmath110 in the state .",
    "the overlap with @xmath69 is easily computed @xmath111 and this can be arbitrarily small .",
    "for instance , if the vast majority of states have @xmath112 and a negligible fraction of them have @xmath73 s of order unity , this overlap is of order @xmath113 .",
    "this example summarizes the main problem of the naive approach that is overcomed by our method .",
    "we want to create a state that has a large overlap with two projectors @xmath69 and @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath71=0 $ ] , we can simply prepare a random state in the image of @xmath69 and use grover s algorithm to amplify @xmath18 .",
    "but when the two projectors do not commute , the amplification of @xmath18 can move the state almost completely outside the image of @xmath69 , so the technique fails .",
    "we make use of an upper and a lower bound on the inner - product of two different momentum states ( c.f .",
    ".  [ eq : momentum ] ) used by our algorithm .",
    "1 ) @xmath114 and 2 ) when @xmath115 , then @xmath116 .",
    "to prove the first bound , we use the inequality @xmath117 for @xmath118 and elementary algebra to obtain @xmath119 as claimed .    for the second bound ,",
    "assume that @xmath115 .",
    "we can use the fact that @xmath120 to obtain @xmath121 raising to the @xmath43th power and using the inequality @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 gives the desired result .",
    "we will now demonstrate that our algorithm will work as advertised , i.e. produce a state of energy @xmath125 , with high probability .",
    "we break this proof into two parts .",
    "first , we show that the algorithm does not systematically abort and second that when it does not abort it produces the right state .",
    "remember that the algorithm aborts when the overlap @xmath126 is less than @xmath127 . using the lower bound derived above ,",
    "we know that if there is at least one eigenvalue , say @xmath128 , that lies in the interval @xmath129 , this overlap will be at least @xmath130 .",
    "since the state is chosen at random , the amplitude @xmath131 has an exponentially high probability of being greater than @xmath132 which is sufficient for the success of the amplification procedure .",
    "note that the interval @xmath129 has a polynomial width , i.e. @xmath29 scales only logarithmically with @xmath12 and @xmath43 polynomially .",
    "thus , we can sweep all values of @xmath42 to this accuracy in polynomial time .",
    "we must now demonstrate that when the amplification procedure succeeds , then with very high probability it generates a state with the desired energy .",
    "we can assume in this case that @xmath133 since otherwise the amplification procedure would have had an exponentially small chance of succeeding .",
    "let us first upper bound the average energy : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the sum restricted to values of @xmath89 such that @xmath136 . using the lower bound on @xmath137 and the fact that @xmath138 we obtain @xmath139 consequently , the desired bound is obtained when @xmath140 .",
    "using our upper bound on the inner product @xmath141 yields @xmath142 which is satisfied with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "similar arguments produce an upper bound on the average energy @xmath145 where @xmath135 is now the sum restricted to values of @xmath89 such that @xmath146 .",
    "using the lower bound on @xmath137 and the upper bound on the inner product @xmath39 gives @xmath147 which is greater than @xmath148 provided that @xmath149 .",
    "note that with a @xmath29 growing polynomially with @xmath150 and @xmath43 growing polynomially with @xmath12 , the error on the energy decreases as @xmath34 and the total running time is @xmath151 as desired .",
    "the analysis of the general algorithm for problems in qma follows similar lines , but the derivation of the filter function is slightly more involved .",
    "the verification circuit @xmath6 acts on @xmath152 qubits : the @xmath12 qubits containing the witness and a @xmath67-qubit scratchpad .",
    "we make use of jordan s result with @xmath69 being the projector onto the all - zero state of the scratchpad and @xmath153 is the projector onto the accepting subspace of the verification procedure .",
    "remember that the verification procedure takes inputs of the form @xmath154 and accepts with probability @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the eigenstates @xmath156 of @xmath72 correspond to witnesses with all - zero scratchpads with an accepting probability @xmath73 .",
    "our algorithm makes use of @xmath29 additional auxiliary qubits , for a total of @xmath157 .",
    "armed eqs  ( [ jordan1]-[jordan4 ] ) , we see that the circuit of figure [ fig : circuit ] applied to the state @xmath158 produces the outcome @xmath159 indeed , we get factor of @xmath74 each time the outcome switches from 0 to 1 or vice versa , and a factor of @xmath160 otherwise . there is an additional factor of @xmath161 for every pair of consecutive 0 s .",
    "let us now analyse our algorithm .",
    "we initialize the first @xmath51 qubits in a random state @xmath19 in the support of @xmath18 .",
    "this is done by setting the first qubit in the state @xmath162 and the remaining @xmath163 qubits in a random stabilizer state , and applying the unitary transformation @xmath164 .",
    "then , we prepare the @xmath29 auxiliary qubits in the state @xmath75 . this can be achieved by a circuit composed of @xmath29 2-qubit gates .",
    "we now apply the inverse of the circuit shown on figure [ fig : circuit ] , producing the state @xmath165 where the ellipsis represents terms outside the image of @xmath166 .",
    "the filter function is defined by @xmath167 in the last step , we have approximated the binomial distributions by normal distributions . at this point , we can use grover s algorithm to amplify the image of @xmath166 , and the rest of the analysis proceeds as above ."

    "<S> , preparing low - energy states is already a very difficult task even when @xmath2 describes a classical system .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this problem is an archetype of the complexity class np . </S>",
    "<S> this class contains all decision problems , i.e. problems of the form  </S>",
    "<S> does @xmath3 satisfy the property @xmath4 ? \" , such that when the answer is  yes \" , there exists a witness @xmath5 that can be used to prove this answer efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , for each @xmath3 there exists a polynomial - size verification circuits @xmath6 such that 1 ) when @xmath7 there exists a witness @xmath5 that will cause @xmath6 to output @xmath8 , and 2 ) when @xmath9 , all witnesses cause @xmath6 to output @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider for instance a local ising model @xmath11 on @xmath12 spins @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S>  is there a spin configuration @xmath14 of energy less than @xmath15 ? \" is a problem in np . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , when the answer is yes , the configuration @xmath14 that achieves this low energy can serve as a witness . verifying the answer boils down to computing the energy , which requires at most @xmath16 operations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , when the answer is  no \" , there is no configuration that can cause the verification procedure to accept . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , an algorithm that solves this problem can be used to determine the ground state energy with little overhead .    </S>",
    "<S> the ising problem is in fact np - complete , meaning that it is the hardest problem in the class @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more surprising is the fact that approximating the energy of the system with an error that increases with the system size @xmath12 is just as hard as the exact case  it is also np - complete . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of a famous theorem on probabilistically checkable proofs ( pcp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although some special cases can be solved efficiently @xcite , there is in general no better algorithm to solve the ising problem than systematically going through all @xmath17 spin configurations to determine the one with lowest energy .    additionally to the immediate physical context </S>",
    "<S> , finding ground states provides a very natural setting for studying combinatorial optimization problems  problems that consist in minimizing an objective function @xmath2 ( playing the role of energy ) over some configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> optimization problems play a vital role in almost every branch of science , from computer science to statistical physics and computational biology @xcite . determining a solution by exhaustive </S>",
    "<S> search is , in general , computationally prohibitive because the size @xmath0 of the search space grows exponentially with the input size . </S>",
    "<S> given the practial importance of optimization problems , more efficient methods are highly desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> a common strategy to solve optimization problems is simulated annealing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> like its name suggests , this method imitates the process undergone by a metal that is heated to a high temperature and then slowly cooled to its configuration of lowest energy . </S>",
    "<S> if the cooling process is too fast , the system can become trapped in a local minimum , resulting in a failure of the algorithm . when the cooling is sufficiently slow however </S>",
    "<S> , thermal fluctuations should prevent this phenomenon from occurring . </S>",
    "<S> thus , simulated annealing requires a detailed knowledge of the energy landscape and therefore can not be applied to all minimization problems . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown recently that a simulated annealing algorithm operated on a quantum computer achieves a quadratic speed - up over classical annealing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether the method can minimize the energy of a quantum system as efficiently is unknown .    </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic quantum computation is another method to tackle this class of problems with a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic theorem asserts that a system prepared in the instantaneous ground state of a hamiltonian that varies slowly in time will remain in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of @xmath2 can thus be prepared by choosing a time - dependent hamiltonian with a simple initial ground state and slowly changing it to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm was applied to randomly generated instances of an np - complete problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm worked well for the small examples that could be simulated on a classical computer . </S>",
    "<S> it was later shown @xcite however that the particular interpolation scheme suggested @xcite fails for satisfiability problems , and the best known upper bound is a running time of @xmath0 @xcite ( poly - logarithmic corrections are ignored throughout ) . in principle , this technique can also be applied to minimize the energy of a quantum hamiltonian , but little is known about its performances in that case .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , grover s algorithm @xcite can find the ground state of a classical system in @xmath1 steps . </S>",
    "<S> given a projector @xmath18 and a state @xmath19 with @xmath20 , grover s algorithm consists of a sequence of two reflections , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> repeating this sequence @xmath23 times has the effect of projecting @xmath19 onto the image of @xmath18 , with small corrections that can safely be ignored for the present discussion . </S>",
    "<S> note that the value of @xmath24 must be approximately known , and this can be achieved by quantum counting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath18 to be the projector on @xmath25 and @xmath19 a uniform superposition of all spin configurations yields , after at most @xmath1 iterations , a state of energy less than @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is obtained by  sweeping \" the value of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> although this remains an exponential scaling , it is significantly faster than a brute force search , and there are indications that this scaling is optimal @xcite .    at first sight </S>",
    "<S> , it seems like this last technique could be used to find the ground state of a quantum many - body system just as well . </S>",
    "<S> all that is needed is a method to implement a projector @xmath18 onto the low - energy states of the system , i.e. @xmath26 for some given @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> combining this method with grover s algorithm on an initial random state would create the desired outcome with high probability . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is not necessary to initialize the system in a truly random state , but instead it can be randomly selected among all _ stabilizer _ states . </S>",
    "<S> these have all the essential properties of random states and , most importantly , can be prepared with at most @xmath16 operations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there is no known procedure to implement the projector on @xmath26 . the phase estimation algorithm </S>",
    "<S> @xcite comes close however : it can be used to estimate the energy of any local hamiltonian with a polynomial small error and failure probability .    to describe this algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to assume that @xmath2 has been normalized such that @xmath27 and to consider its spectral decomposition , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase estimation algorithm uses @xmath29 auxiliary qubits initially in the state 0 and , given an eigenstate @xmath30 of @xmath2 , produces the output @xmath31 where @xmath32 these are  momentum \" states , so the value of @xmath33 can be estimated via fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can implement an approximation @xmath18 of the projector on @xmath26 by running the phase estimation algorithm and projecting the auxiliary qubits onto the subspace of low momentum . combining this method with grover s algorithm </S>",
    "<S> should thus yield a good approximation of the ground state .    however , a detailed analysis ( see appendix [ naive ] ) of this  naive \" approach reveals a failure . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that the projector @xmath18 constructed from phase estimation is only an approximation of @xmath26 and errors can build up during the amplification procedure . </S>",
    "<S> there are two sources of errors . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the quantum computer can not exactly reproduce the dynamics of the many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a problem however since a @xmath34 accuracy can be achieved using a trotter - suzuki decomposition at a polynomial cost @xcite , and this error does not build up . </S>",
    "<S> we will henceforth safely ignore this source of error .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , even when the energy @xmath33 associated with @xmath30 is well above the acceptance threshold @xmath15 , there is a small probability that phase estimation will diagnose it as being smaller than @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is these imperfections that cause the algorithm to fail because they build up during amplification . </S>",
    "<S> the typical outcome of this naive algorithm is an entangled state of the system and auxiliary qubits rather than a low - energy state of the system qubits tensored with the all - zero state of the auxiliary qubits . </S>",
    "<S> detailed knowledge of the energy landscape  such as the presence of an energy gap  could be used to circumvent this effect , but in general the method will fail .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now present our algorithm that works for all local hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by making two modifications to the naive algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis is presented in the appendices . </S>",
    "<S> the first modification is to run the algorithm backward : we initialize the system qubits in a random state @xmath35 , the auxiliary qubits in a low momentum state @xmath36 ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : momentum ] ) , and execute the inverse of the phase estimation algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this produces the state @xmath37 where the ellipsis represents terms where the auxiliary qubits are in a state orthogonal to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath39 is a function of @xmath40 peaked at 0 with a width @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can use grover s algorithm to amplify the all - zero state of the auxiliary qubits and obtain a state that is mostly a superposition of those eigenstates of @xmath2 with eigenvalues close to @xmath42 , i.e. the amplitude of each term in the superposition gets re - weighted by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure truly acts as a filter , suppressing the amplitude of eigenstates outside its bandwidth for benefit of the eigenstates inside the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the auxiliary qubits are systematically returned to @xmath10 as desired .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this is still not sufficient for our purpose because the filter has a heavy tail . </S>",
    "<S> there is an exponential number of states with energy outside the bandwidth , so unless their amplitude is exponentially suppressed , they can significantly shift the energy of the state . </S>",
    "<S> the filter we have constructed offers a polynomial suppression ; we need a filter that drops more abruptly outside its bandwidth .    </S>",
    "<S> this requires a second modification to the naive algorithm and is realized by repeating the phase estimation @xmath43 times , using a total of @xmath44 auxiliary qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the same state @xmath45 as above ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> .  [ eq : phi ] ) , except that the factor @xmath46 is now raised to the @xmath43th power . for those @xmath33 that are within @xmath47 of @xmath42 , this factor is at least @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the overlap of this state with the projector @xmath49 will typically be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of eigenstates of @xmath2 in the bandwidth of the filter .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , grover s algorithm can be used to amplify this overlap to nearly 1 in a time at most @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> when the overlap of the state with the filter is too small , i.e. if @xmath53 say , this step will fail and the algorithm will abort . choosing @xmath54 and @xmath55 yields , after a successful application of grover s amplification , a state of energy @xmath56 as desired ( see appendix [ ground ] ) . to summarize , this algorithm acts as a filter on the energy . the position @xmath42 and width @xmath57 of the filter are specified by the user . when no eigenstates of @xmath2 lie within the filter s bandwidth , the algorithm aborts as desired .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the method can be adapted in a straightforward way to produce thermal distributions of the system at any temperature @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we could in a first step combine our method with quantum counting @xcite to estimate the density of states @xmath59 with a @xmath34 resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we could then choose an energy scale @xmath15 at random according to the distribution @xmath60 and use our algorithm to prepare a state of energy close to @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the classical case , determining the ground state energy of a local quantum many - body system within accuracy @xmath34 is a complete problem for the complexity class known as quantum merlin and artur ( qma ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether the problem remains complete when an extensive error is tolerated is unknown , but would be a natural quantum extension of the pcp theorem . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , qma is a natural generalization of np : it is defined similarly except that both the witness and the verification circuit @xmath6 are quantum mechanical . beside the @xmath12 witness qubits on which it operates </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath6 can also make use of @xmath61 auxiliary qubits initialized in the state @xmath10 that serve as a scratchpad during the computation . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the verification procedure is obtained by measuring the first output qubit of the circuit . </S>",
    "<S> because of the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics , this procedure is probabilistic : 1 ) when @xmath7 , there exists a witness @xmath5 that will cause @xmath6 to output @xmath8 with probability greater than @xmath62 , and 2 ) when @xmath9 , all witnesses cause @xmath6 to output @xmath8 with probability less than @xmath63 where @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> the completeness of the local hamiltonian problem for the class qma suggests that our algorithm can be used to solve all these problems and prepare the relevant witness in a time @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not quite right because the mapping to the local hamiltonian problem does not preserve the size of the witness . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a small modification almost does the trick .    </S>",
    "<S> a good witness is a @xmath66 qubit state @xmath19 with 1 ) all @xmath67 ancillary qubits in the state @xmath10  summarized by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the projector onto the all - zero state of the auxiliary qubits  and 2 ) a probability at least @xmath63 of outputting @xmath8 at the verification procedure  summarized by @xmath70 where @xmath18 is the projector associated with the verification procedure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the tasks of preparing a good witness boils down to producing a state that maximizes the overlap with two projectors @xmath69 and @xmath18 . when @xmath71 = 0 $ ] , this task can be accomplished straightforwardly with grover s algorithm , but additional efforts are required in the general case . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> if we start say with a random state in the image of @xmath69 and amplify the projector @xmath18 , we will typically obtain a state that is mostly supported outside the image of @xmath69 , unless @xmath71=0 $ ] .    the method we propose to solve this problem is a modification of our algorithm that builds on the work of mariott and watrous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main modification is to replace the phase estimation algorithm by the circuit of figure [ fig : circuit ] . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a sequence of @xmath29 ( odd ) alternating measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath69 whose outcomes are coherently recorded on @xmath29 auxiliary qubits initially in the state 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of this circuit on an eigenstate @xmath30 of the operator @xmath72 with eigenvalue @xmath73 can be analyzed using a result of jordan @xcite ( see appendix [ jordan ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the @xmath29 auxiliary qubits becomes a superposition of all sequences of @xmath10 and @xmath8 , and the amplitude of consecutive distinct outcomes , i.e. the amplitude associated to each  switches \" from 0 to 1 or vice versa , is @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , counting the number of switches in the measurement outcomes allows us to estimate the eigenvalue @xmath73 of the state .     and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are coherently imprinted on @xmath29 auxiliary qubits . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is therefore analogous to phase estimation , except that the eigenvalue @xmath73 is not encoded in a momentum state but in a state with a certain number of switches between the outcomes 0 and 1 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we must replace the momentum state used in our algorithm by a state with the right distribution of switches @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the number of switches and @xmath77 the number of pairs of consecutive @xmath10 s . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth @xmath78 is adjusted by setting @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> one important advantage of this type of filter state is that it drops very abruptly outside its bandwidth , @xmath80 is essentially proportional to a normal distribution centered at @xmath81 and of variance @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is no need for multiple copies of the filter state and the rest of the algorithm proceeds as before .    </S>",
    "<S> this more general algorithm does not perform as well as the algorithm used for local hamiltonians because it searches over a larger hilbert space : the space of the witness and the scratchpad . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected since it makes no assumption about the structure of the verification procedure @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> note however that all known  natural \" problems in qma  e.g. non - identity check @xcite , consistency of quantum states @xcite , @xmath0-representability @xcite , and zero - error capacity of quantum channels @xcite  use a scratchpad of only logarithmic size , so in those cases the running time is the same as for local hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to conjecture that the scratchpad of all problems in qma can be reduced to this size .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a method to prepare ground and thermal states of quantum many - body systems on a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> the time required by our algorithm is equal to the square - root of the hilbert space dimension of the system  the same time required to prepare the ground state of a classical many - body system . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a speed up by a power of 6 compared to exact diagonalization , which in general is the only available technique to accomplish this task on a classical computer . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps surprising that this task can not be accomplished by a straightforward combination of phase estimation and grover s algorithm , but our analysis of this strategy reveals an important failure and more elaborate methods were required . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum computer , if it could be built , could serve as an efficient simulator of quantum many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> the method we have presented would complement this simulation by initializing the computer in a low - energy state of the simulated system .    with some modifications , </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm can be used to solve and prepare relevant witnesses of all problems in the complexity class qma , the quantum generalization of np . in that case , the physical task consists of preparing a state that has a large overlap with two projectors . </S>",
    "<S> problems in np form a special case where those projectors commute and can be solved straightforwardly using grover s algorithm . however , in the general case the projectors do not commute and more sophisticated techniques were required .    </S>",
