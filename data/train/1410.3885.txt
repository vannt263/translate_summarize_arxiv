    "nowadays technological advances allow manipulation of single molecules with sufficient precision to study many mechanical , kinetic and thermodynamic properties thereof .",
    "recent reviews of techniques used and results obtained in single - molecule experiments ( smes ) can be found in refs .  @xcite . in these experiments , typically the force applied to pull the biomolecule is recorded as a function of its end - to - end distance , thereby producing a force - extension curve ( fec ) .",
    "this fec characterizes the molecule elasticity and provides information about its processes of folding and unfolding @xcite . in the following ,",
    "the end - to - end distance of the biomolecule is referred to as the total length @xcite .",
    "the force  extension curves are different depending on whether the total length or the force are controlled . when the total length of the protein is used as a control parameter ( length - control ) , the unfolding transition is accompanied by a drop in the measured force and a sawtooth pattern is the typical force  extension curve @xcite . when the force is the control parameter ( force - control ) , unfolding of several or",
    "all single protein domains may occur at a constant value of the force @xcite .",
    "other questions are related to the rate at which the control parameter ( length or force ) sweeps the force  extension curve : depending on the loading rate , stochastic jumps between folded and unfolded protein states may be observed @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the force vs. extension curves provides valuable information about the polyprotein , the dna or the rna hairpin .",
    "let us consider atomic force microscope ( afm ) experiments in which a modular protein comprising a number of identical folds ( modules or units ) is pulled at a certain rate ( length - control ) @xcite .",
    "the typical value of the force @xmath0 at which the unfolding takes place is related to the mechanical stability of the units : a larger value of the force is the signature of higher stability .",
    "nevertheless , it should be stressed that the unraveling of a domain is a stochastic event and occurs for forces within a certain range .",
    "a second feature of the sawtooth fec is the spacing between consecutive force peaks .",
    "this spacing is directly related to the difference of length between the folded and unfolded configurations of one unit .",
    "this is the reason that the peaks of the fec of artificially engineered modular proteins are regularly spaced .",
    "a typical example is i27@xmath1 , composed of eight copies of immunoglubulin domain 27 from human cardiac titin .",
    "the spacing between peaks for this protein is @xmath2 nm at an unfolding force of @xmath3pn @xcite .",
    "this length increment is found by fitting several peaks of the fec with the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model of polymer elasticity @xcite .",
    "more recently , force - controlled afm experiments with a i27 single - module protein have been reported @xcite .",
    "these experiments provide data free from the module to module variations that even an artificially engineered polyprotein has .",
    "berkovich et al .",
    "have interpreted their results using a simple langevin equation model that includes an effective potential with two minima for a range of the applied force @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of pulling experiments is well established under both force and length control .",
    "for controlled force , the relevant thermodynamic potential is a gibbs - like free energy , whereas for controlled length it is a helmholtz - like free energy @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the sawtooth structure of the fec of biomolecules is already present at equilibrium , as shown very recently in a simple model with a landau - like free energy @xcite .",
    "however , the control parameter in real experiments with biomolecules ( force or length ) changes usually with time at a finite rate @xcite",
    ". knowledge of these dynamical situations is not as complete as in the equilibrium case . under force control ,",
    "we can write a langevin equation ( or the associated fokker - planck equation ) in which noise amplitude and effective friction are linked by a fluctuation - dissipation relation , as done in refs .  @xcite . on the other hand , under length control",
    ", the situation is more complex : the force is no longer a given function of time but an unknown that must be calculated by imposing the length constraint .",
    "this has lead to the proposal of simple _ dynamical algorithms _ such as the quasi - equilibrium algorithm of ref .",
    "while being successful in reproducing experimentally observed behavior , these algorithms do not correspond to the integration of well - defined evolution equations .    in some cycling experiments , the biomolecule is switched between the folded and unfolded configurations , at a certain switching rate @xcite .",
    "after liphardt et al . , we call such a process a stretching / relaxing or an unfolding / refolding cycle @xcite",
    ". the unfolding typically occurs at a force @xmath4 that is larger than the refolding force @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , some hysteresis is present and , moreover , the unfolding ( refolding ) force typically increase ( decrease ) with the pulling rate . a reversible curve in which @xmath6 is only observed for a small enough rate .",
    "some authors have claimed that this is a signature of irreversible non - equilibrium behavior and thus used these experiments to test non - equilibrium fluctuation theorems @xcite . on the other hand , for a simple model for which only the force - controlled situation could be analyzed @xcite , it has been found that the observed behavior in biomolecules can be understood as the system sweeping a certain part of the metastable equilibrium region of the fec that surrounds @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", the system is exploring metastable minima of the system free energy landscape .",
    "one of the main goals of this work is to determine if this physical picture also holds for length - controlled experiments .    in this paper , we add two important ingredients of real biomolecule pulling experiments to a simple model with independent domains and landau - like free energy whose equilibrium analysis is given in ref .",
    "we add : ( i ) dynamical effects and ( ii ) interacting units .",
    "dynamical effects are introduced by means of langevin or fokker - planck equations , both under force and , most interestingly , length control .",
    "therefrom , we can carry out a systematic investigation of the dynamical fec , when the control parameter ( force or length ) is varied at a finite rate .",
    "the simplest way to introduce interaction between modules is via a harmonic potential trying to drive them to global equilibrium . in this way , the creation of _ bubbles _ , that is , regions of unfolded modules inside regions of folded ones , has a free energy cost .",
    "this is expected to be most relevant for systems in which the unfolding / refolding of units is mainly sequential , as in the unzipping of dna hairpins @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the complex and force - sensitive behavior of polyproteins observed in force - clamp experiments has been recently explained by sequential unfolding @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients of our model are bistability of protein modules and , in the length - controlled case , a global constraint that introduces a long - range interaction among modules .",
    "these features are quite general in physics , as they appear in many different fields . for instance , many particle storage systems such as the storage of lithium in multi - particle electrodes of rechargeable lithium - ion batteries @xcite , air storage in interconnected systems of rubber balloons @xcite , or voltage biased weakly coupled semiconductor superlattices @xcite . throughout the paper , the analogies and differences that arise in these different physical situations will be discussed .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows .",

    "final remarks are made in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "appendix a explains unfolding and refolding under length control using a more realistic potential , whereas appendices b and c deal with some technical aspects not covered in the main text .",
    "to be specific , let us consider afm unfolding of modular proteins : they are stretched between the tip of the microscope cantilever and a flat , gold - covered substance ( platform ) , whose position is externally controlled .",
    "the forces acting on the molecule bend the cantilever which , in turn , determines the applied force with pn precision .",
    "see fig .  1 of refs .   or   for an idealized situation .",
    "in force - controlled experiments with a single module protein , the free energy of an extending protein comprises at least two distinct components , an entropic term that accounts for chain elasticity and an enthalpic component that includes the short - range interactions arising between the neighboring amino acids as the protein contracts @xcite . in a certain force range , these two components cause the single - module free energy to have two minima , corresponding to the folded and unfolded states of the domain @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system comprising @xmath7 modules .",
    "the @xmath8-th module extends from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , so that its extension is @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the configuration @xmath13 defines the polyprotein state at a mesoscopic level of description . when isolated , the free energy of the @xmath8-th unit is @xmath14 , a double - well potential whose minima correspond to the folded and unfolded states discussed above .",
    "@xmath15 is the set of relevant intensive parameters , like the temperature @xmath16 and the pressure @xmath17 of the fluid ( thermal bath ) surrounding our system .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 accounts for the slight differences from unit to unit : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , if all units are identical and thus no _ quenched disorder _ is present in the system .",
    "as part of the tertiary structure of the polyprotein , modules are weakly interconnected by linkers in a structure - dependent way @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable that this weak interaction acts on the unfolding / refolding time scale and tries to bring the extensions of the modules to a common value , corresponding to global mechanical equilibrium . for the sake of simplicity , we model the linkers as harmonic springs . thus the system free energy @xmath21 for a given configuration of module extensions @xmath22 is @xmath23 if all the linkers are identical , @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , and the elastic constants may depend on the intensive parameters .",
    "the length @xmath26 of a polyprotein in a configuration @xmath22 is @xmath27    the experiments are carried out at either force - controlled or length - controlled conditions .",
    "firstly , we analyze case ( i ) , in which a certain external force @xmath28 is applied to the ends of the protein or dna hairpin . for a detailed discussion of how this is achieved in real experiments ,",
    "see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ( ch .  6 ) and @xcite for the optical tweezers case , and @xcite for the afm case . in our simplified theoretical approach",
    ", we only have to add a term @xmath29 to the free energy @xmath30 . in this way",
    ", we obtain a gibbs free energy @xmath31 ,    [ 1.2 ] @xmath32 @xmath33    note that we are not taking into account the limited bandwidth of the feedback device that controls force in real experiments ; we are assuming that the desired force program @xmath34 is perfectly implemented .",
    "secondly , we investigate the length - controlled situation , case ( ii ) . for a schematic representation of the experimental situation ,",
    "see for instance fig .  1 of ref .",
    ": the length @xmath35 between the base of the cantilever and the platform is the externally controlled quantity . on the other hand",
    ", the cantilever tip deflects a certain distance @xmath36 from its base , such that @xmath37 .",
    "if the stiffness ( spring constant ) of the cantilever is @xmath38 , we have an extra harmonic term in the potential @xmath39 , that is , @xmath40^{2},\\ ] ] therefore , an extra force @xmath41 $ ] acts over each unit , trying to keep the polyprotein length equal to @xmath35 : the larger @xmath42 , the better the length - control is , as expected on intuitive grounds and explicitly shown in @xcite . in this paper , with the exception of appendix a , we assume perfect length control , that is , we consider the limit @xmath43 that implies @xmath44 over the time evolution of the units and a finite value of the corresponding extra force @xmath45 . in other words , @xmath45 tends to a limiting value @xmath46 that depends on the prescribed length @xmath35 .",
    "this unknown value is the force required to attain the total length @xmath35 , and it has to be calculated by imposing the constraint @xmath47 . the effect of this limit on the relevant thermodynamic potential for the length - controlled case @xmath48 shall be discussed in the section on fokker - planck description of the dynamics .    finally , we would like to stress that the present model has some similarities with the more complicated one proposed by hummer and szabo for the unfolding of polyproteins several years ago , see appendix c of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the module extensions @xmath49 , these authors consider the module centers of mass @xmath50 as independent unknowns .",
    "these variables interact through a quadratic potential that yields a linear restoring force whenever @xmath51 departs from @xmath52 .",
    "the site potential for the module extensions is the sum of a wlc potential and a harmonic potential @xcite , instead of the double - well potential we consider in the main text or the asymmetric potential we consider in appendix a. moreover , hummer and szabo introduce a wlc linker that connects the polyprotein with the length - controlling device , which is absent in our model .      the extensions @xmath49",
    "obey coupled langevin equations with the appropriate thermodynamic potential . the friction coefficient and the amplitude of the white noise",
    "are related by a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the _ source _ for both the friction and the stochastic force is the fluid the modules are immersed in , which is assumed to remain in equilibrium at temperature @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the modules inertia can be neglected and thus their evolution equations are overdamped ,    [ langevin_eqs ] @xmath53",
    "@xmath54    here @xmath55 is the friction coefficient for the @xmath8-th module , and we measure the temperature in units of energy ( @xmath56 ) . in general , the friction coefficients @xmath57 may depend on the system configuration @xmath22 , if hydrodynamic interactions play a significant role in the considered unfolding scenario .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider this possibility in the present paper . in this respect , it is interesting to remark that , in the more complicated model of ref .",
    "@xcite , module centers of mass and extensions satisfy langevin equations with different extension - dependent diffusion coefficients .",
    "our presentation of the model above implies that the langevin equations are valid both in force - controlled and length - controlled experiments , but ( i ) in force - controlled experiments , @xmath28 is the known force program , whereas ( ii ) in length - controlled ones we have @xmath58 .",
    "we differ the discussion on the experimental situation with an `` imperfect '' length control ( because of the finite value of the stiffness @xmath38 of the device controlling the length ) to the next section on the equivalent fokker - planck description of the dynamics . for perfect length control ,",
    "@xmath34 is determined by imposing the constraint @xmath59 , which yields    @xmath60    @xmath61    the parameter @xmath62 is an average friction coefficient . in the case of identical units , @xmath63 , @xmath20 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath65 is a sum of gaussian variables , and thus its statistical properties are completely given by its first two moments .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath70 , its variance tends to zero as @xmath71 , which is the typical behavior of fluctuating quantities in statistical mechanics .",
    "even so , it should be noted that in biomolecules @xmath7 is not necessarily very large and certainly not of the order of avogadro s number , and thus fluctuations play a major role . in force  extension experiments , the length is usually uniformly increased / decreased with time @xmath72 , @xmath73 with a constant @xmath74 .",
    "it is convenient to render our equations dimensionless .",
    "we set the length unit @xmath75 $ ] equal to the difference between the extensions of the two free energy minima of a single unit for a certain applied force .",
    "it is natural to adopt the critical force , at which the two minima are equally deep , as the unit of force , @xmath76=f_c$ ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] depend on the specific choice of the double - well potential @xmath77 .",
    "the free energy unit is then @xmath76\\,[\\eta]$ ] .",
    "we select the time scale as @xmath78=\\gamma[\\eta]/[f]$ ] , where @xmath62 is the typical friction coefficient experienced by the units",

    "we have to introduce a lagrange multiplier @xmath46 and look for the minima of @xmath103 , that is , the same minimization as in the force - controlled case .",

    "the unfolding / refolding transitions take place neither at a perfectly constant force nor at a perfectly constant length as seen in figs .",
    "[ disc_l ] and [ force_rips ] , because of the finite resolution of the the devices controlling the force or the length .",

    "the key point is how this arrhenius time scale compares to that defined by the variation of the force or length : it is only when the characteristic time defined by the variation of the force or length is longer than the arrhenius time that the equilibrium fecs are recovered , because the force / length program can then be considered quasi - static and there is no hysteresis .",
    "we have shown in several cases throughout the paper that this feature implies that a decrease in the temperature ( while keeping the rate of variation of the force / length ) leads to a much wider hysteresis cycle . in this cycle ,",

    "our results show that , in these elasticity experiments , biomolecules display what may be called a `` metastable equilibrium behavior '' .",
    "they follow stationary fec branches that can be obtained out of the equilibrium solution of the fokker - planck equation , and dynamic out - of - equilibrium excursions do not depart too much from them .",
    "the hysteresis cycles , completely similar to those observed in real experiments , stem from equilibrium multistability : at the highest loading rates , the system is not able to reach the absolute minimum but sweeps a certain part of the metastable region ( the narrower the smaller the rate is ) of the equilibrium free energy landscape .",
    "there are techniques to obtain single molecule free energy differences from time - dependent driving about hysteresis cycles @xcite .",
    "in addition , the complete single molecule free energy landscape can be obtained using model - dependent algorithms @xcite .",
    "although there is some evidence of glass - like behavior in force - clamp experiments with proteins @xcite , hysteresis in these unfolding / refolding experiments seems to be quite different from the more complex out - of - equilibrium hysteresis of glassy systems in cooling / heating cycles .",
    "when cooled down to low temperatures , glassy materials depart from the equilibrium curve and end up in a far from equilibrium state ; when reheated , they return to equilibrium approaching a normal curve , which typically overshoots the equilibrium one @xcite .    we have also discussed in detail the role of the interaction between neighboring units of the chain .",
    "the main effect of this interaction is the reduction of the width of the metastability region .",
    "when the elastic interaction is absent , all the configurations with the same number @xmath171 of unfolded units have the same free energy .",
    "this `` entropic term '' is reduced when the elastic interaction is taken into account , since the free energy also depends on the number of domain walls separating regions of unfolded and folded units and the configuration with only one domain wall ( pinned wave front ) is favored . from a physical point of view , this decrease is responsible for the reduction of force fluctuations , which are at the root of the width of the metastability region .",
    "thus , we expect that the same behavior will be present for more realistic interaction potential between modules . in real biomolecules for which their on - site potentials and number of modules are similar",
    ", a smaller size of the rips may be linked to a stronger interaction between the neighboring units .",
    "the relevance of the interaction between units is also clearly shown by the fact that the metastability regions in the first ( completely folded ) and last ( completely unfolded ) branches are wider than those of the intermediate ones .",
    "this leads to the existence of some `` intrinsic '' hysteresis in the first / last force rips of the fec under length - controlled conditions , even for very low pulling rates , close to the quasi - static limit .",
