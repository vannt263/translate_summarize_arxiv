    "one of the problems of algebraic number theory is to get deep knowledge of the galois groups of various galois extensions of number fields , especially maximal extensions of number fields with restricted ramification .",
    "such galois groups can be regarded as tale fundamental groups of spectra of algebraic integer rings punctured at some closed points , and they play essential roles for understanding the arithmetic of number fields , analogous to the role geometric fundamental groups of manifolds do in geometry . in other words , the tale fundamental group @xmath1 of the ring of integers @xmath2 of a number field @xmath3",

    "hence we can find examples of abelian or solvable tale fundamental groups .",
    "however , one can get little information on the structure of @xmath6 itself via class field theory , especially in the case where @xmath6 is a nonabelian simple group .",

    "we have the following natural question : is it possible to show that @xmath19 without assuming grh , thereby proving unconditionally the existence of a non - solvable tale fundamental group ?    to do this ,",

    "we must find a polynomial @xmath84 with relatively small coefficients . from the work of basmaji and kiming @xcite ,",
    "it is known that there is a unique @xmath14-extension of @xmath15 which is ramified only at @xmath16 with ramification index @xmath26 , and so there is a unique @xmath0-extension of @xmath15 ramified only at @xmath16 with ramification index @xmath26 .",

    ", we must find sufficiently many integral elements with small multiplicative norm .",
    "for this purpose , we desire a  nice \" integral basis for @xmath82 in the sense that embedded basis elements have small euclidean lengths in @xmath105 . for the basis @xmath106 found by the montes package in the previous subsection , the euclidean lengths range from @xmath107 to a rather large @xmath108 ,",
    "so we do not yet have a  nice \" basis .",
    "we thereby encounter the classical problem of lattice basis reduction .",
    "we can apply the lenstra - lenstra - lovsz ( lll ) algorithm @xcite , but it only gets us so far : a single application of the lll algorithm in maple to our initial basis @xmath109 yields a new basis in @xmath96 with euclidean norms ranging from @xmath110 to approximately @xmath111 , a substantial improvement yet not good enough for our goal of finding integral elements of small multiplicative norm .",
    "indeed , a vector in @xmath96 with euclidean norm of 64.51 can have a multiplicative norm larger than @xmath112 .",
    "there exist several other methods of lattice basis reduction that can produce shorter vectors than the lll algorithm at the expense of longer running time , but here we take a somewhat naive approach that is easy to implement in maple , using its native implementation of the lll algorithm .",
    "suppose that , given a list of basis vectors @xmath113 in @xmath114 , we want apply the lll algorithm to produce a basis of relatively short vectors . typically , for lattices of high dimension and vectors of widely varying euclidean length , the results can be improved if the @xmath115 are first ordered in ascending length prior to applying the lll algorithm .",
    "this motivates the following approach :    1 .",
    "sort the vectors so that the @xmath115 are in ascending length .",
    "2 .   apply the lll algorithm to the sorted list of vectors to produce a new list of basis vectors @xmath115 .",
    "repeat steps 1 and 2 until the desired shortness of basis vectors is achieved , or until repeating steps 1 and 2 no longer produces bases with shorter vectors .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , this simple method works quite well with the integral basis @xmath106 of @xmath82 . as mentioned above , we first applied lll to @xmath109 to get a new basis .",
    "then we applied steps 1 and 2 repeatedly ( in fact , 279 times ) until we obtained another basis @xmath116 that has sufficiently short @xmath117 .",
    "the @xmath117 have euclidean norms that range from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "the inverse of change of basis matrix to get from @xmath109 to @xmath120 can be found as an ancillary file with the arxiv submission of this paper .",
    "our next step is to find integral elements of our number field @xmath17 with small multiplicative norm .",
    "then we can apply the theorem from @xcite to establish an upper bound for the class number . to find such elements of small norm",
    ", we will search over  sparse \" vectors , i.e.  vectors where almost all the coefficients are zero with respect to the basis @xmath121 .",
    "table [ tableprimenorm ] lists the elements of small prime norm that are found by searching over  sparse \" vectors .",
    "these prime integers generate principal ideals which totally split in @xmath17 into 120 principal prime ideals , each of which is generated by the given element or one of its galois conjugates .",

    ".generators of some small degree 1 primes in @xmath82 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we are now in a position to prove our main result by applying theorem [ upperbound ] and corollary [ cor ] .    by searching for elements of small norm , and taking quotients where necessary",
    ", we find a number of primes that can be included in the set @xmath55 of unramified primes that factor into principal prime ideals .",
    "in particular , the following 36 primes totally split into degree 1 principal primes in @xmath17 : @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 also , the following 11 primes factor into degree 2 principal primes in @xmath17 : @xmath125 finally , the following three primes factor into degree 3 principal primes in @xmath17 : @xmath126 if we include these primes in our set @xmath55 and set @xmath127 , we find that @xmath128 we can numerical calculate the integral and find that @xmath129 since the root discriminant of @xmath17 is @xmath130 , we have : @xmath131 therefore , by theorem [ upperbound ] , we get an upper bound for the class number of @xmath17 : @xmath132 since the class number is an integer , we deteremine that @xmath133 applying corollary [ cor ] , we conclude that the class number of @xmath17 is 1 .",

    "there are at least two possible approaches : one is to gain sufficient knowledge of the prime ideals of the unramified extension in order to bound the degree of the extension , similar to our approach for bounding the degree of hilbert class field .",
    "but this is difficult : we do not have access to a class field theory for nonabelian extensions as we have in the abelian case .",
