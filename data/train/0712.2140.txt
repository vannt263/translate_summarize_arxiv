    "in @xcite , the authors have formulated boundary conformal field theory in real time ( lorentzian signature ) in the algebraic framework of quantum field theory .",
    "bcft is a local mbius covariant qft @xmath2 on the two - dimensional minkowski halfspace @xmath3 ( given by @xmath4 ) , which contains a ( given ) local chiral subtheory @xmath5 , e.g. , the stress - energy tensor . the reward of this approach was the surprisingly simple formula ( ( [ relcomm ] ) below ) , expressing the von neumann algebras of local observables @xmath6 in a double cone @xmath7 in terms of an ( in general nonlocal ) chiral conformal net @xmath8 of localized algebras associated with intervals along the boundary ( the time axis @xmath9 ) .",
    "the net @xmath8 is mbius covariant and contains the local chiral observables @xmath5 : a(i)b(i ) for each interval @xmath10 .",
    "the reduction to a single chiral net is responsible for a kinematical simplification , explaining , e.g. , cardy s observation @xcite that in bcft , bulk @xmath11-point correlation functions are linear combinations of chiral @xmath12-point conformal blocks .",
    "the algebra @xmath6 is a relative commutant of @xmath13 within @xmath14 , [ relcomm ] b_+(o ) = b(k)b(l ) , where @xmath15 are a pair of open intervals on the boundary @xmath16 such that the disconnected complement @xmath17 is the set of advanced and retarded times @xmath18 associated with points in @xmath19 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "although the chiral net @xmath8 is not necessarily local , the intersections ( [ relcomm ] ) do commute with each other when two double cones are spacelike separated .",
    "the main result in @xcite is that every bcft is contained in a maximal ( haag dual ) bcft of the form ( [ relcomm ] ) .",
    "* figure 1 : * intervals on the boundary and double cones in the halfspace .",
    "this leads to a somewhat paradoxical conclusion : on the one hand , each local bulk observable is defined as a ( special ) observable from a chiral cft .",
    "thus , superficially , the `` degrees of freedom '' of a bcft are not more than those of a chiral cft , containing only a single chiral component of the stress - energy tensor ( virasoro algebra ) .",
    "one might argue that such a `` reduction of degrees of freedom '' is a characteristic feature of qft with a boundary .",
    "but this point of view can not be maintained , because on the other hand , the resulting bcft @xmath2 is locally equivalent to another cft @xmath20 on the full two - dimensional ( 2d ) minkowski spacetime , which has all the degrees of freedom of a 2d qft , and in particular contains a full 2d stress - energy tensor ( two commuting copies of the virasoro algebra ) . even in the simplest case , when the chiral net @xmath8 on the boundary coincides with @xmath5 ( sometimes known as `` the cardy case '' ) , the associated bulk qft contains apart from the full 2d stress - energy tensor more ( `` non - chiral '' ) local fields that factorize into chiral fields with braid group statistics .",
    "locally , also the bcft contains the same fields .",
    "this paradoxical situation is not a contradiction ; it rather shows that `` counting degrees of freedom '' of a qft is an elusive task .",
    "trivially , there is no obstruction against a proper inclusion of the form @xmath21 if @xmath22 is an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "but `` counting degrees of freedoms '' , e.g.  by entropy arguments , requires the specification of the hamiltonian .",
    "the bcft shares the hamiltonian and ground state ( vacuum ) of the chiral cft , while the associated 2d cft has a different hamiltonian and a different ground state .",
    "thus , with respect to different hamiltonians , the spacetime dimension ( measured through some power law behaviour of the entropy ) may assume different values ( 1 or 2 , in the present case ) .",
    "looking at the issue from a different perspective , we may start from a vacuum representation of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the latter integrates to a unitary projective representation of the diffeomorphism group of the circle @xmath23 , which contains the diffeomorphism group of an interval @xmath24 as a subgroup . for two open intervals with disjoint closures",
    ", there is a canonical identification between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in terms of the stress - energy tensor @xmath27 ,",
    "this amounts to an isomorphism between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , when @xmath30 and @xmath31 have disjoint support . it would be hard to see this local isomorphism directly in terms of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the mathematical theorem underlying these facts is the well - known split property @xcite , which can be derived in local qft in any dimension under a suitable phase space assumption . in chiral local cft ,",
    "a sufficient assumption is the existence of the conformal character @xmath32 .    in the algebraic framework , the _ chiral _ observables of a bcft ( e.g. , the stress - energy tensor ) localized in a double cone @xmath33 are operators belonging to the von neumann algebra @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two open intervals of the time axis ( `` advanced and retarded times '' ) such that @xmath37 , @xmath38 for @xmath19 ( this justifies the notation @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 are the von neumann algebras generated by the unitary exponentials of chiral fields smeared within @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the _ chiral _ observables in a 2d cft are operators in the algebra @xmath41 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are regarded as two open intervals of the lightcone axes , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are generated by left and right chiral fields .",
    "our present association between bcft and 2d cft applies to the case when @xmath44 , i.e. , the left chiral observables @xmath45 are isomorphic with the right chiral observables @xmath46 , and both are isomorphic with the chiral observables @xmath40 of the bcft .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the vacuum hilbert space for the chiral cft described by the algebras @xmath40 .",
    "the split property states that if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two intervals with disjoint closures , there is a canonical unitary @xmath48 implementing an isomorphism [ splitiso ] ( a(i)a(j))^ * = a(i)a(j ) .",
    "the split isomorphism does not preserve the vacuum vector , i.e. , the canonical `` split vector '' @xmath49 is an excited state in @xmath47 . by construction ,",
    "the split state @xmath50 on @xmath51 has the property that its expectation values for either subalgebra @xmath40 or @xmath52 coincide with those in the vacuum state , but the correlations between observables @xmath53 and @xmath54 are suppressed : [ splitstate ] ( , a_1a_2 ) = ( , a_1)(,a_2 ) = ( , a_1)(,a_2 ) .",
    "the split isomorphism depends on the pair of intervals @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it trivially restricts to algebras associated with subintervals , but it does not , in general , extend to larger intervals . when the intervals touch or overlap , a split state and the split isomorphism cease to exist .",
    "while the split isomorphism is well known , we discuss in this paper its extension to `` non - chiral '' local observables , which do _ not _ belong to @xmath51 in the bcft , and to @xmath55 in the 2d cft .    as a concrete demonstration for the resolution of the above `` paradox '' , we present two simple but nontrivial examples where the algebraic relations outlined can be easily translated into the field - theoretic setting , i.e.",
    ", we characterize the local algebras of the various qfts in terms of generating local wightman fields .",
    "let us translate ( [ relcomm ] ) into the field - theoretic language .",
    "the intervals @xmath35 and @xmath36 shrink to the points @xmath18 when @xmath39 shrinks to a point @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we have to approximate a field @xmath57 of the bcft by observables in @xmath58 ( where the interval @xmath59 approximates @xmath60 from the outside ) , that commute with all fields localized in the interval @xmath61 ( which approximates @xmath60 from the inside ) .",
    "this will be done in sect .  2 . a crucial point here",
    "is that generating the local algebra @xmath58 involves `` non - pointwise '' operations , e.g. , typical observables may be exponentials of smeared field operators , so that an element of the relative commutant is not necessarily localized in the disconnected set @xmath62 .    a second",
    ", somewhat puzzling feature of the algebraic treatment of bcft is the fact that the description of the local algebras @xmath6 in terms of the chiral boundary net ( eq .  ( [ relcomm ] ) ) is much simpler than that of the local algebras @xmath63 of the associated @xmath64 conformal qft without a boundary .",
    "the latter are ( rather clumsily ) defined as jones extensions of the tensor products @xmath55 in terms of a q - system constructed from the chiral extension @xmath65 with the help of @xmath66-induction @xcite .",
    "one purpose of this work is to present a more direct construction of the 2d cft without boundary from the bcft .",
    "the obvious idea is to take a limit as the boundary is `` shifted to infinity '' .",
    "but we shall do more , and establish the _ covariant _ local isomorphism between the subnets @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath69 , i.e. , the restriction of the aqfts to any double cone @xmath70 within the halfspace @xmath4 , at finite distance from the boundary .",
    "the main problem here is , of course , the enhancement of the conformal symmetry , i.e. , the reconstruction of the unitary positive - energy representation of the two - dimensional conformal group @xmath71 from that of the chiral conformal group @xmath72 .",
    "this is done by a `` lift '' of the chiral mbius covariance of the local chiral net @xmath5 , using the split property which allows to `` embed '' the 2d chiral algebra @xmath55 into a local bcft algebra @xmath6 .",
    "this will be done in sect .",
    "the point is that only a single local algebra of the bcft is needed for this reconstruction of the 2d conformal group and the full 2d cft .    in sect .  4",
    ", we show that the 2d cft can also be obtained through a limit where the boundary is `` shifted to the left '' , or equivalently , the bcft observables are `` shifted to the right '' .",
    "the translations in the spatial direction `` away from the boundary '' do not belong to the chiral mbius group of the bcft .",
    "but they are at our disposal by the previous lifting of the 2d mbius group into the bcft . therefore , we can study the behavior of correlation functions in the limit of `` removing the boundary '' .",
    "as we shift the boundary , the retarded and advanced times are shifted apart from each other .",
    "the convergence of the vacuum correlations of the bcft to the vacuum correlations of the 2d cft is therefore a consequence of the cluster behavior of vacuum correlations of the chiral cft @xmath5 .",
    "we add three appendices containing some related observations .",
    "the purpose of this section is to illustrate the construction ( [ relcomm ] ) in a field - theoretic setting .",
    "it is convenient to assume the trivial chiral extension @xmath73 since even in this case the construction ( [ relcomm ] ) is nontrivial , i.e. , non - chiral local bcft fields that factorize into nonlocal chiral fields can be constructed from local chiral fields only .",
    "we exhibit local bcft fields in a region @xmath74 as `` neutral '' chiral operators , that behave like products of `` charged '' chiral operators localized in @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the limit of large distance from the boundary .",
    "the limit of pointlike localization is also discussed , and reproduces familiar vertex operators .",
    "consider the free @xmath75 current @xmath76 with commutator @xmath77=2\\pi i\\delta'(x - y)$ ] and charge operator @xmath78 .",
    "the unitary weyl operators @xmath79 for real test functions @xmath30 satisfy the weyl relation [ weyl ] w(f)w(g ) = e^-i(f , g)w(f+g ) = e^-2i(f , g ) w(g)w(f ) and have the vacuum expectation value [ ground ] ( w(f ) ) = e^-i(f_-,f_+ ) = e^- 12__+kdk f(k)^2 where the symplectic form is [ symp ] ( f , g)= 12_dx(f(x)g(x ) - f(x)g(x ) ) = 12i_kdkf(-k)g(k ) , and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) correspond to the restrictions to positive ( negative ) values of @xmath82 of the fourier transform @xmath83 . with these conventions , @xmath84 is a state with charge density @xmath85 .",
    "the vacuum correlations of weyl operators are [ corr ] ( w(f_1)w(f_n ) ) = e^-i(_i(f_i-,f_i+ ) + 2 _ i < j(f_i-,f_j+ ) )    the weyl operators @xmath86 with @xmath87 define the local von neumann algebras of the chiral net @xmath88 .",
    "we fix a double cone @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a test function that vanishes outside @xmath59 and is constant in @xmath61 , then @xmath86 belongs to @xmath58 and commutes with @xmath90 by ( [ weyl ] ) and ( [ symp ] ) , hence [ neut ] w(f)b_+(o ) = a(k)a(l ) .",
    "these are examples of operators that belong to @xmath6 but ( if @xmath91 ) not to @xmath92 .",
    "weyl operators can also be defined for smooth functions @xmath30 such that @xmath93 has compact support , and the relation ( [ weyl ] ) holds .",
    "then @xmath94 is called the charge .",
    "however , @xmath95 diverges , and the vacuum expectation value ( [ ground ] ) vanishes unless @xmath96 ( see below ) .",
    "this implies that correlation functions ( [ corr ] ) of charged weyl operators vanish whenever the total charge is non - zero ( charge conservation ) , while the ir divergences in each term in the exponent of ( [ corr ] ) cancel for neutral correlations .",
    "the neutral weyl operators ( [ neut ] ) in @xmath6 are ( up to a phase factor ) products of charged weyl operators with charge densities localized in @xmath36 and in @xmath35 .    in the limit of sharp step functions",
    "@xmath97 ( requiring a regularization @xcite ) , the regularized weyl operators @xmath98 become the well - known vertex operators of charge @xmath99 and scaling dimension @xmath100 @xcite , which are formally written as v_-q(u ) = : ( iq_u^ j(y)dy ) : .",
    "thus , as @xmath33 shrinks to a point @xmath101 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 shrink to the points @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the ( regularised ) weyl operators @xmath104 behave as _ q(t , x ) = v_q(t+x ) v_-q(t - x ) .",

    "it is then easily seen that @xmath107 commutes with @xmath108 when either @xmath109 or when @xmath110 , because in these cases the anyonic phase factors cancel .",
    "it also commutes with @xmath111 if @xmath112 .",
    "these are precisely the requirements for locality of the fields @xmath113 among each other , and relative to the conserved current j_0(t , x ) = j(t+x ) + j(t - x),j_1(t , x ) = j(t+x ) - j(t - x ) defined for @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are local fields on the halfspace @xmath3 .",
    "the correlation functions of @xmath11 fields @xmath116 are correlations of @xmath12 vertex operators ( @xmath12-point conformal blocks ) .    after this digression to pointlike fields ,",
    "let us resume the study of the correlation functions ( [ corr ] ) of the smooth weyl operators @xmath117 , and their behavior as @xmath33 is shifted away from the boundary .",
    "we choose @xmath11 test functions of the form [ g - h ] f_i = g_i - h_i where @xmath118 , @xmath119 are smooth step functions with values @xmath120 at @xmath121 and @xmath122 at @xmath123 , such that @xmath124 is supported in @xmath36 and @xmath125 is supported in @xmath35 ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "the condition ( [ comm ] ) can be equivalently written as the eigenvalue equation [ eigen ] ( y):= ^12 ( 1_r^ * 1_|)(_,^*_,|^ * ) ( 1_y1_)x_2 ! = y. here @xmath455 where @xmath456 is the dual canonical isometry ( such that @xmath457 form a q - system ) ; @xmath458 , and @xmath459 is the index @xmath460 $ ] .",
    "@xmath461 and @xmath462 are the concatenation and the monoidal product in the tensor category of dhr endomorphisms of @xmath5 .",
    "the map @xmath463 defined by ( [ eigen ] ) is a linear map @xmath464 .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) obviously follows from ( [ comm ] ) by left multiplication with @xmath465 and right multiplication with @xmath377 . to see that ( [ eigen ] ) implies ( [ comm ] ) , one may insert ( [ eigen ] ) into both sides of ( [ comm ] ) and repeatedly use the relations of the dual q - system @xmath466 to get equality .",
    "we thank i. runkel who has pointed out to us that @xmath463 is in fact a projection . hence the charged intertwiners @xmath238 are precisely given by @xmath467 where @xmath468 is in the range of @xmath463 .",
    "the multiplicities @xmath334 in ( [ dim ] ) equal the dimension of the range of these projections ( for each pair @xmath218 ) .",
    "if @xmath5 is completely rational , the c * tensor category defined by its dhr superselection sectors is modular @xcite , i.e. , the unitary @xmath469 and @xmath27 matrices defined by the statistics @xcite generate a representation of the group @xmath470 . by the verlinde formula @xcite",
    ", these matrices also describe the modular transformation behavior of chiral partition functions ( `` characters '' ) .    by @xcite ,",
    "the matrix @xmath471 given by ( [ dim ] ) is a modular invariant ( it commutes with @xmath469 and @xmath27 ) , hence the partition function of the 2d cft @xmath20 on @xmath189 is invariant under modular transformations .",
    "we want to point out an interesting relation of this fact to haag duality of the associated bcft .    as mentioned before , every bcft defined by ( [ relcomm ] ) is automatically haag dual , and any non haag dual bcft @xmath472 with the same chiral observables is intermediate between @xmath185 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the charged intertwiners @xmath473 constitute linear subspaces of the spaces of charged intertwiners in @xmath2 .",
    "let the dimensions of these spaces be @xmath474 , and at least one of them @xmath475 ( i.e. , @xmath472 is strictly contained in @xmath2 ) .",
    "then the matrix @xmath476 can not be a modular invariant by the following simple argument : consider the @xmath477 component of @xmath478 . because each @xmath479 is positive , ( s^*z s)_00 = _ ij s_0is_0j z_ij is strictly smaller than @xmath480 .",
    "if @xmath481 were modular invariant , we would conclude @xmath482 , which is impossible .",
    "we notice that the construction of a 2d cft associated to a bcft described in sect .",
    "3 takes an intermediate bcft @xmath483 to an intermediate 2d cft @xmath484 .",
    "its hilbert space is of the form ( [ h2d ] ) with @xmath471 replaced by @xmath476 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the partition function of the associated 2d cft is modular invariant if and only if the bcft is haag dual .      commun .  math",
