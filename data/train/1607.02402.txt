    "following the discovery of a 125 gev higgs boson in the first run of the lhc @xcite , several studies of its properties were undertaken .",
    "the current situation is that the measured higgs signal rates in all channels agree with the standard model ( sm ) predictions at the @xmath5 level  @xcite .",
    "although the current lhc higgs data are consistent with the sm , there is still the possibility that the observed higgs state could be part of a model with an extended higgs sector including , e.g. , an extra doublet , singlet and/or triplet .",
    "as the discovered higgs state belongs to a doublet , we concern ourselves here with such a scenario .",
    "most of the higher higgs representations with an extra doublet predict in their spectrum one or more charged higgs bosons .",
    "discovery of such a state would therefore be an indisputable signal of an extended higgs sector and a clear evidence for a departure from the sm .",
    "one of the main goals of the 13 tev lhc ( eventually to be upgraded to 14 tev ) is to improve the precision of the measurements of the higgs couplings , thus to access potential new physics indirectly .",
    "however , in parallel , direct searches for new higgs states will also take place in the quest to find an evidence of physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the sm is the 2hdm , which contains two higgs doublets , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , used to give mass to all fermions .",
    "the particle spectrum of the 2hdm is as follows : two cp even ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ) , one cp odd ( @xmath11 ) and a pair of charged ( @xmath12 ) higgs bosons . at hadron colliders , a charged higgs boson can be produced through several channels .",
    "light charged higgs states , i.e , with @xmath13 , are copiously induced by @xmath14 production followed by the top decay @xmath15 ( or the equivalent antitop mode ) .",
    "when kinematically allowed , @xmath16 + c.c . provides the most important source of light charged higgs bosons , above and beyond the yield of various direct production modes : @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes one of the three neutral higgs bosons  @xcite , @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of all available @xmath12 hadro - production modes in 2hdms . )    at the tevatron and lhc , light charged higgs bosons can be detected through @xmath27 followed by @xmath28 decay .",
    "in fact , for a light charged higgs state the @xmath28 decay is the dominant mode .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments have already drawn an exclusion on br@xmath29 based on the search for the corresponding decay chain @xcite .",
    "other channels , such as @xmath30 , have also been searched for by atlas and cms @xcite .",
    "assuming that br@xmath31 , one can set a limit on br@xmath32 to be in the range @xmath33 to @xmath34 for a charged higgs mass between 90 and 150 gev .",
    "we remind here in passing that charged higgs bosons have been also searched for at lep - ii using charged higgs pair production followed by either @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath3 @xcite . if the charged higgs boson decays dominantly to @xmath28 or @xmath37 , the lep - ii lower bound on the mass is of the order of 80 gev while in the case where charged higgs decay is dominated by @xmath38 , via a light cp - odd higgs state ( @xmath39 gev ) , the lower bound on the charged higgs mass is about 72 gev @xcite .",
    "+ -4 mm    the aim of this letter is to show that the bosonic decays of a _ light _",
    "charged higgs boson , such as @xmath40 and/or @xmath41 , could be substantial and may compete with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , @xmath40 with leptonic decay of @xmath44 could be an alternative channel to @xmath42 in order to discover a light charged higgs boson at the lhc owing to the handle offered by the sm - like higgs mass reconstruction , now possible after discovery @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also discuss the case of a light cp - odd higgs @xmath45 gev where @xmath46 could be substantial and reach a 100% branching fraction while being consistent with lhc and lep data .",
    "this possibility may suggest that a light charged higgs state could have escaped detection during previous lhc searches .",
    "therefore , the bosonic decays of a 2hdm charged higgs boson might be complementary to the usual search channels @xmath42 and @xmath47 .",
    "we also point out that @xmath48 would lead to the same final state as @xmath49 in the case where @xmath8 and @xmath11 decay to @xmath50 . clearly , there are kinematic differences between these three channels , so that one can eventually separate them , e.g. by reconstructing the @xmath51 pair around a higgs resonance ( 125 gev or others ) and/or the @xmath52 pair around the ( anti)top pole , yet it may pay off to devise an inclusive approach that maximizes the signal yield across the three decay decay patterns @xcite .",
    "we begin with a short comment on the set of independent parameters of the 2hdm we will be using .",
    "we will use the most general scalar potential with a @xmath53 symmetry softly broken by a @xmath54 + h.c . term .",
    "such potential is fixed by 7 independents parameters ; @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and cp - even mixing @xmath61 .",
    "it is well known that , in the framework of a 2hdm - ii , the @xmath62 constrain forces the charged higgs mass to be heavier than 480 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we will deal only with a 2hdm type - i ( 2hdm - i ) where a light charged higgs state is still allowed by all @xmath63-physics constraints @xcite so long that @xmath64 .    in this study , @xmath8 is taken to be the sm - like higgs boson and will be fixed at 125 gev .",
    "the other parameters are varied within a specific range in order to satisfy theoretical as well as experimental constraints .",
    "we have used the public code 2hdmc-1.7.0 @xcite to perform the scan over the 2hdm parameter space .",
    "the program is also linked to higgsbounds-4.3.1 and higgsignals-1.4.0 @xcite to check against available collider constraints . a systematic scan is performed over @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath60 and @xmath65 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath61 is fixed from @xmath66 .",
    "the mass of heavy higgs boson was fixed at @xmath67 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mctb1 ] , we scan over the @xmath68 plane and set @xmath69 with @xmath70 while @xmath71 . the black / grey regions are excluded from theoretical constraints while the yellow region is excluded by experimental constraints at 95%cl .",
    "it is clear that a light a charged higgs state with mass @xmath72 gev is excluded from @xmath42 and @xmath73 searches @xcite .",
    "we are left with a small region with @xmath74 $ ] gev in which we have evaluated br@xmath75 and br@xmath76 .",
    "the two brs are quantitatively shown in the vertical palettes : left is for br@xmath77 and right is for br@xmath76 .",
    "one can see that , in this scenario , before the top - bottom threshold , br@xmath77 can reach 10% for a charged higgs mass around 160 gev and @xmath78 . after crossing the top - bottom threshold ,",
    "br@xmath77 becomes suppressed and br@xmath76 gets enhanced so as to dominate over all other decays .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mctb3 ] we illustrate the size of br@xmath76 ( left ) and br@xmath79 ( right ) over the ( @xmath80 ) plane for @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 . as one can see , lhc data favor @xmath66 to be rather close to the decoupling limit : @xmath85 , which implies @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the coupling @xmath87 , which is proportional to @xmath88 , is suppressed for @xmath85 while the @xmath89 one , which is a gauge coupling , has no suppression factor .",
    "this fact will make br@xmath90 larger than br@xmath91 in the special case of @xmath92 .",
    "it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mctb3 ] that br@xmath76 and br@xmath79 are anti - correlated .",
    "the dominance of br@xmath76 needs @xmath93 while the dominance of br@xmath79 needs @xmath94 .",
    "we now turn to the case of a light cp - odd higgs state , with @xmath95 gev .",
    "such a higgs state is still allowed by lep - ii and lhc data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcma2 ] we scan over both the cp - odd and charged higgs boson masses over the following region : @xmath96 gev @xmath97 120 gev , @xmath98  gev  @xmath99 200 gev with @xmath100 125 gev , @xmath66 = @xmath101 , @xmath60 @xmath102 5 and @xmath103 gev . in this scan ,",
    "the yellow region is where @xmath46 is kinematically not allowed and therefore the charged higgs boson will decay dominantly to @xmath28 and/or @xmath37 pairs and is excluded by lhc data .",
    "however , over a substantial area of the @xmath104 plane , it is clear that br@xmath90 can be the dominant decay channel , i.e , for @xmath105 gev for any value of the charged higgs mass and in such a case br@xmath76 becomes a sub - leading channel .",
    "we finally show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mctb4 ] the single charged higgs production cross section where the @xmath12 state comes from ( anti)top decays following @xmath14 hadro - production : @xmath106 , where @xmath107 or @xmath11 . we plot @xmath108 ( for @xmath107 on the left and for @xmath109 on the right ) as a function of the charged higgs mass for @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 , @xmath70 , @xmath112 gev and @xmath113 gev@xmath114 .",
    "both cross sections reach their maximum values for @xmath115 gev . in the case of @xmath109 the cross section is larger than in the case @xmath107 and can be of order 400450 fb at the two highest lhc energies of 1314 tev .",
    "notice that the former is larger than the latter primarily because br@xmath90 can be about 4 times larger than br@xmath91 ( for the same higgs boson masses , as discussed ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have proven the existence within the 2hdm - i of sizable regions of the parameter space compliant with all available theoretical and experimental constraints yielding substantial brs for @xmath12 decays into @xmath116 ( with @xmath8 being the sm - like higgs state ) and/or @xmath38 in which the @xmath12 mass is less than @xmath117 , wherein @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) . under the circumstances , @xmath12 production in single mode from the decay of a(n ) ( anti)top quark is possible with high rates , which are indeed potentially accessible during the present run 2 of the lhc .",
    "these regions of parameter space within the 2hdm - i are ameanable to immediate experimental investigation by the atlas and cms collaborations , which have so far concentrated their attention almost exclusively onto @xmath28 and/or @xmath120 decays of a light charged higgs state emerging from @xmath121 production and decay .",
