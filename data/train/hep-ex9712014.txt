    "measuring purely leptonic decays of heavy mesons allows the determination of meson decay constants , which connect measured quantities , such as the @xmath5 mixing ratio , to ckm matrix elements .",

    "measurements of the cabibbo - favored pseudoscalar decay constants such as @xmath0 provide a check on these calculations and help discriminate among different models .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath8 is given by @xcite @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 mass , @xmath12 is the mass of the final state lepton , @xmath13 is a ckm matrix element equal to 0.974 @xcite , and @xmath14 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "various theoretical predictions of @xmath0 range from 190 mev to 350 mev .",
    "because of helicity suppression , the electron mode @xmath15 has a very small rate .",
    "the relative widths are @xmath16 for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 final states , respectively .",
    "unfortunately the mode with the largest branching fraction , @xmath20 , has at least two neutrinos in the final state and is difficult to detect .    in a previous publication @xcite ,",

    "in this paper we describe an improved cleo analysis .",
    "we use a sample of about 5 million @xmath28 events collected with the cleo ii detector @xcite at cesr .",
    "the integrated luminosity is 4.79 fb@xmath29 at the @xmath30 resonance or at energies just below .",
    "this paper supersedes our previous result which was based on a subset of the current data with 2.13 fb@xmath29 .",
    "the improvements include a better analysis algorithm , more data , more precise measurements of the lepton fakes , and reduced systematic uncertainties .",

    "we search for the decay chain @xmath31 , @xmath23 .",
    "the photon from the @xmath32 decay and the muon from the @xmath23 decay are measured directly , while the neutrino is measured indirectly by using the near - hermeticity of the cleo ii detector to determine missing momentum and energy .",
    "using the missing momentum as the neutrino momentum , we look for a signal in the mass difference @xmath33 so that the relatively large errors from the missing momentum calculation will mostly cancel . to study the @xmath34 signal and background shapes and to evaluate the effectiveness of our monte carlo efficiency simulation",
    ", we also collect a data sample of similar topology , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we treat these fully reconstructed data events as @xmath23 decays by removing the measurements of the @xmath37 from both the tracking chambers and the calorimeter to simulate the @xmath38 , and by  identifying \" the @xmath39 as a muon .",
    "our aim here is to compare the monte carlo simulation of these @xmath40 decays with what we obtain from the data .",
    "another useful event sample consists of the decay sequence @xmath41 , @xmath42 , since this sample has relatively high statistics and negligible background .",
    "we use these events to study the missing energy and momentum measurements by eliminating the measurements of the fast @xmath37 from the @xmath43 decay from both the tracking chambers and calorimeter to simulate the neutrino , and call the @xmath39 a muon .",
    "there are several potential sources of background for this measurement .",
    "the real physics backgrounds , such as semileptonic decays , are almost identical in muon and electron final states because of lepton universality . for the leptonic @xmath8 decay , however , the electronic width is negligible in comparison to the muonic width .",
    "thus , performing the identical analysis except for selecting electrons rather than muons gives us a quantitative measurement of the background level due to real leptons .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath44 are the only physics processes that produce significantly more primary muons than electrons with momenta above 2  gev/_c _ in continuum @xmath26 annihilations in the @xmath45 energy region .",
    "@xmath44 decay background in our sample is highly suppressed by the ckm angle ( eq . [ equ_rate ] ) , and by the small @xmath46 branching ratio , ( @xmath47)% @xcite .",
    "another source of background results from the misidentification of hadrons as muons ( fakes ) . since muon identification in cleo ii has larger fake rates than electron identification , we need to consider the excess fakes in the muon sample relative to the electron sample . to determine the hadron - induced muon and electron fake background contributions",
    ", we multiply the @xmath34 distribution of all tracks , excluding identified leptons , by an effective hadron - to - lepton fake rate , measured with tagged hadronic track samples .",
    "the detailed analysis of this effective fake rate is described in section  [ background ] .    after removing the above two components , all remaining events result from either @xmath22 , @xmath48 decays , or from spurious combinations of random photons and real @xmath23 and @xmath44 decays .",
    "the shape of the latter component is determined using the fully reconstructed @xmath49 data sample , and the normalization is determining by measuring the @xmath50 production ratio .",
    "subsequently , we will form a single signal shape from these two signal components .",
    "most of the leptons from @xmath7 meson decays are removed by requiring a minimum lepton momentum of 2.4  gev/_c _ , which is 33% efficient for @xmath23 .",
    "leptons from @xmath51 pairs , and other qed processes with low multiplicity , are suppressed by requiring that the event either has at least five well reconstructed charged tracks , or at least three charged tracks accompanied by at least six neutral energy clusters . to suppress background from particles that escape detection at large cos@xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the angle with respect to the beam axis , we require that the angle between the missing momentum of the event and the beam axis , @xmath54 , does not point along the beam direction , specifically @xmath55 .",
    "muons are required to penetrate at least seven interaction lengths of iron , and to have @xmath56 .",
    "the muon identification efficiency , measured with @xmath57 events , is ( 85@xmath581)% for muons above 2.4 gev and is very flat in momentum .",
    "electrons must have an energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter close to the fitted track momentum , and a @xmath59 measurement in the main drift chamber consistent with that expected for electrons .",
    "the electron identification efficiency for @xmath56 , is found by embedding tracks from radiative bhabha events into hadronic events . for electrons with momentum greater than 2.4 gev , a value of ( 89@xmath582)% is used .",
    "to subtract the electron data from the muon data we need to have a precise measure of the muon to electron normalization .",
    "detector material causes a difference between muons and electrons , as electrons tend to radiate more .",
    "the correction factor is estimated to lower the electron rate by 5% : thus we assign a + 5% increase in the electron sample due to this outer bremmstrahlung .",
    "a monte carlo study shows that the main background contributions from real leptons in the @xmath34 distribution are semileptonic @xmath60 decays , mostly @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as a specific example of the near equality of the muon and electron rates we made a detailed study of the @xmath64 decay .",
    "a calculation of the different probabilities that a photon is emitted in the decay ( inner bremsstrahlung ) for @xmath65 was performed according to the prescription of atwood and marciano @xcite .",
    "this effect raises the electron rate by + 2.7% .",
    "this inner bremsstrahlung correction for the different semileptonic final states averages also to + 2.7% .",
    "we also correct for differences in muon and electron phase space , which lowers the relative electron normalization ( @xmath66 for @xmath65 ) . taking all of these sources into account , including the different possible decay modes and the fact that the electron detection efficiency is 4% larger than the muon efficiency",
    ", we use a correction factor of 1.01@xmath580.03 to multiply the electron sample to account for the physics backgrounds and the identification efficiency difference .",
    "photons must be in the angular region @xmath67 .",
    "we require a minimum energy of 150 mev , which is 78% efficient for @xmath31 decay , to eliminate backgrounds caused by the large number of low energy photons .",

    "a small residual @xmath70 background is suppressed by requiring that the thrust axis lines up with the @xmath32 candidate momentum so that the cosine of the angle between them is greater than 0.975 .      to evaluate the neutrino four - vector we measure the missing momentum and energy in only half of the event ; we divide the event into two hemispheres using the thrust axis of the event . the missing momentum @xmath71 and energy @xmath72 are calculated using only energy and momentum measurements ( @xmath73 ) in the hemisphere that contains the lepton ( kaon ) .",
    "we compute the energy sum assuming all tracks are pions , unless they are positively identified as kaons , or protons by _ de / dx _ measurement in the drift chamber .",
    "we define the missing momentum and energy as @xmath74 where the direction of @xmath75 is given by the thrust axis .",
