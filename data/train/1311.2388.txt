    "the tasep is equivalent to a special case of the nagel - schreckenberg model for traffic flow @xcite . here",
    "all bonds are updated simultaneously while in the original formulation , the random - sequential update , only one particle move can occur per infinitesimal time - step . in general , particles enter the lattice on site @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 and leave the lattice from site @xmath0 with probability @xmath5 . in between particles on sites",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) may move with probability @xmath8 if the target site @xmath9 is empty . for later use",
    "we introduce also the symbol @xmath10 which denotes the probability that any of the possible moves is not executed .",
    "note that for random - sequential update those probabilities are replaced by rates . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath11",
    "there are three different phases : a low - density phase , a high - density phase and a maximum - current phase . here , the maximum - current phase is special , since all physical quantities become independent of the input and output probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5  the system behaves as if @xmath12 .",
    "the average density in the maximum - current phase is @xmath13 . in the limit @xmath14",
    "only one move per time - step occurs and one recovers the well - studied tasep in continuous time .",
    "+ while for random updating many results are known there is a definite lack of results for the parallel updating scheme @xcite .",
    "one reason is that the structure of the exact solution @xcite , @xcite appeared to be much more involved .",
    "based on a simplified formulation of the exact solution @xcite the present article tries to close this gap a little more since especially the parallel update is important for practical modeling of traffic @xcite . in this article",
    "we calculate as the main result the weight for @xmath1 particles and @xmath15 holes in the open system . for continuous time",
    "this quantitiy has been calculated by derrida et .",
    "twenty years ago in @xcite .",
    "it further has a natural interpretation as the normalization of a related system on a ring with one second - class particle .",
    "this normalization is given by so - called narayana numbers @xcite .",
    "we will derive the analogous results for the parallel case here . recently",
    "a connection between equilibrium lattice walks and the normalization of the tasep in different variants has been established .",
    "one of those interpretations involves so - called motzkin paths .",
    "a motzkin path is a path defined on the triangular lattice .",

    "possible are the steps @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an up - step , @xmath20 is a level step and @xmath21 is a down step .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the set of those motzkin paths .",
    "then their number @xmath23 is given by the @xmath24-th motzkin number .",
    "the problem can also be formulated as a random walk in 1d that starts and ends at site 0 ( or 1 ) .",
    "if the horizontal axis represents time , the two - dimensional walk corresponds to the trajectory of the walker .",
    "a level step means that the walker has not moved during the time - step .",
    "an up - step ( down - step ) means that the walker increases ( lowers ) its coordinate by one .",
    "a brownian excursion @xcite , @xcite is a special motzkin path that never even touches the horizontal axis apart from the first and last vertex .",
    "it can simply be constructed from a motzkin path by adding an up - step at the beginning and a down - step at the end @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will find a motzkin path interpretation of the generating function for @xmath1 particles on an open lattice of @xmath0 sites .",
    "for this interpretation we use a coloring of those different steps as it was considered in @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we consider the generating function of the open tasep and show how it is related to the generating function of weighted motzkin paths . after taking the thermodynamic limit",
    "we obtain expressions for the generating function of weighted motzkin paths at given length .",
    "we calculate the tasep - generating function for the weight of configurations with given number of particles .",
    "then we see how this function is interpreted in terms of a coloring of the corresponding motzkin path .",
    "we write an expression for the weight that the open tasep system contains @xmath1 particles .",
    "finally we introduce a second - class particle dynamics on the ring that has conserving dynamics and relate it to the one obtained for the tasep in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the matrix representation that derrida et .",
    "@xcite presented for the known recursion relations of the tasep came as a very elegant and compact formulation of a non - equilibrium steady state . since then , this technique has become very successful to calculate many stationary properties for the tasep and related models , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that the stationary weight for a lattice configuration @xmath25 of the tasep with random - sequential update can be written as @xmath26 in this notation the matrix @xmath27 represents occupied sites ( @xmath28 ) and the matrix @xmath29 represents empty sites @xmath30 .",
    "the boundary vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 ensure that the resulting matrix product is reduced to a scalar @xmath33 .",
    "those weights @xmath33 are stationary if the matrices and vectors involved satisfy the set of relations @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , now widely known as the dehp - algebra .",
    "the matrices and vectors are half - infinite and there are different representations that have certain combinatorial interpretations @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath37 is given by catalan numbers .",
    "it was shown in @xcite for the case of a single second - class particle on the ring that the weight for a fixed number of particles @xmath1 and @xmath38 holes is given by @xmath39\\langle 1|(xd+ye)^{l}|1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{l+1}{l+1 \\choose n}{l+1 \\choose n+1}.\\ ] ] here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fugacities for particles and holes respectively .",
    "the combinatorial term on the right - hand side is known as the narayana numbers @xcite . among many other applications",
    "they are known to count dyck paths  those are motzkin paths without level steps . in @xcite this formula ( or more precisely the equivalent formula of @xcite ) was used for the tasep with open boundaries , too .",
    "the reason why in both models the weights for @xmath1 particles are the same is that the dehp algebra holds for both models under the same ansatz . now to the parallel - update tasep .",
    "the exact stationary state is known to be of a matrix form , too @xcite . from the findings in @xcite",
    "it follows that the weight of a configuration in the maximum - current phase can be written as @xmath42 with @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we interpret @xmath43 as the number of particle - hole domain walls in the configuration @xmath44 .",
    "this is one possible choice following @xcite .",
    "again the vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 reflect the boundaries and the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath29 represent particles and holes respectively but are different from those for the random - sequential case .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the normalization can be expressed as @xmath46 in contrast to ( [ ra ] ) the term on the right - hand side is the @xmath47th narayana polynomial .",

    "this representation is a direct generalization of one known representation for the continuous - time case @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "to calculate the weight for @xmath1 particles on a lattice of size @xmath0 , our aim is to study @xmath52 . for details of the following steps ,",
    "the reader is referred to appendix [ prelim ] .",
    "first , we note ( [ zs ] ) that @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 our intention is to study the generating function @xmath55 which follows from ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "the formula for the generating function shows its two faces. on the one hand @xmath56 has an interpretation as contributing to the grand - canonical normalization @xmath57 for taseps of size @xmath0 ( in terms of the tasep fugacity @xmath58 ) and on the other hand @xmath56 will be interpreted as the generating function of motzkin paths of length @xmath24 with fugacity @xmath59 .",
    "we could also take @xmath60 since the exponent of @xmath58 can already be worked out by replacing @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however at this stage it will turn out useful .",
    "the use of the explicit representation ( [ repres ] ) yields the tri - diagonal matrix @xmath63 this is the actual starting point of the problem with ( [ mxy ] ) being interpreted in terms of a weighted motzkin path with the transition matrix ( [ tildec ] ) with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 being the weights for level - steps , up - steps and down - steps , respectively .",
    "related tri - diagonal matrices appear in the tasep with a second - class particle @xcite and in the partially asymmetric exclusion process @xcite for example .",

    "from the first - return decomposition one finds @xcite that @xmath56 fulfills @xmath69 .",
    "we see that the polynomials @xmath70 and @xmath71 only appear as a product @xmath72 .",
    "this is because a path from height @xmath73 to @xmath73 has the same number of up- and down - steps .",
    "hence up-/down - step pairs have weight @xmath74 and the generating function reads @xcite , @xcite in terms of the fugacity @xmath59 counting motzkin steps : @xmath75 in appendix [ eq ] , @xmath56 is calculated alternatively , following calculations in @xcite .",
    "this is done without use of an explicit representation just by manipulation of the general matrix @xmath76 in ( [ mxy ] ) to calculate @xmath77 and finally taking the matrix element . the resulting expression which involves a function that appears in @xcite for several lattice paths",

    "a model system is presented that mimics second - class particle dynamics and for which preliminary results were published in @xcite .",
    "we change the boundary conditions and consider a closed periodic chain with one of the particles carrying a cargo .",
    "the unit of the particle and the cargo is referred to as the second - class particle . under the parallel update every particle ( with or without cargo )",
    "moves forward with probability @xmath8 if the target site is empty . in the most simple case the cargo",

    "note that for random update both expressions for @xmath56 and @xmath141 are even the same .",
    "this is due to the fact that for random update the weights for @xmath1 particles on a lattice with @xmath0 sites are the same for open boundaries and a second - class particle on the ring .",

    "it focuses on the thermodynamic limit and simplifies some results of @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the 2nd - class particle is shown to be calculated through @xcite @xmath146 here @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the densities directly behind and in front of the 2nd - class particle @xmath149 .",
    "the dynamics of the 2nd - class particle is obtained from ( [ rel1]-[rel6 ] ) .",

    "the reason for this increase in the necessary number of colours is the complexity of the parallel update .",

    "this nicely reflects the increase from a quadratic to a quartic algebra .",
    "it is expected that the structure found here also holds for similar models with parallel update while the other possible updates mentioned above lead to a ( @xmath161)-colored path . in the @xmath108 motzkin path ,",
    "red steps are associated with particles or holes while black steps correspond to particle - hole pairs .",
    "therefore paths with the same length do not necessarily correspond to tasep configurations of the same system size .",
    "one could alternatively represent particle - hole pairs by a succession of two steps , see also motzkin paths with higher rank considered in @xcite .",
    "however those paths would not end at height @xmath73 , in general .",
    "the fact that a fraction of the particle - hole domain walls corresponds to motzkin steps in a different colour somewhat reflects the fact that under parallel update such a fraction contributes to the flow . in this paper",

    "further investigations shall consider the fluctuations of the particle number as in @xcite using the findings of the present paper .",
    "this is planned to be done in the near future",
    ". additionally it would be interesting to compare the joint current - density distribution with the one for random - sequential update @xcite . to finally generalize present results to arbitrary @xmath4 and",
