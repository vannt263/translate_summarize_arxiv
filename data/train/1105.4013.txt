    "the landau - zener ( lz ) problem @xcite consists of a two - level system whose parameters are varied so that an anti - crossing of energy levels occurs .",
    "the transition between two energy states at an avoided level crossing in two- and multi - level systems is one of the few exactly solvable problems of time - dependent quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "dynamics in atomic , molecular and mesoscopic systems can be described by the lz process ; see , for example , references within @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental realizations of many - body generalizations of lz dynamics have been shown with ultracold atoms @xcite and theoretically analyzed considering strongly correlated bosons under fast sweeps @xcite .",
    "the use of an interacting bec driven in a bichromatic optical lattice has also been proposed as a realization of many - body nonlinear lz dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , there exists an approximate solution for a non - interacting many - body generalization of the lz problem , including coupling to a quantized field , suggesting that many - body lz physics can be profoundly different from the single two - level system interacting with a classical field case @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , we analyze the lz problem of the one two - level system coupled to a quantized field .",
    "first , we introduce a quantized lz model and propose a realization in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit - qed ) where weak- and strong - coupling regimes can be obtained ; we also discuss plausible realizations of a formal many - body generalization of the model .",
    "next , we present a right - unitary - transformation scheme to diagonalize the proposed quantized lz model in the field basis under weak - coupling and show that the exact time evolution of the system is directly related to solutions of the standard lz problem . finally , we show a parity - related - transformation scheme to diagonalize the proposed quantized lz model in the two - level system basis under strong - coupling and show that the resulting infinite set of differential equations is amenable for numerical solutions for a few starting excitations in the field .",
    "a two - level system , that is , a qubit , driven by a quantized field is described by the model hamiltonian , @xmath0 where the pauli matrices associated to the qubit are given by the operators @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , and the symbol @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the quantized field .",
    "the qubit two - level transition and the field frequencies are given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and the qubit - field coupling by the parameter @xmath7 .    in the weak - coupling regime , where the values of the qubit - field coupling are at least an order of magnitude less than the qubit transition frequency , @xmath8 , the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is valid and the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite , in units of @xmath9 , describes the system , @xmath10 the excitation number @xmath11 is conserved by the jc model , @xmath12=0 $ ] .",
    "hence in a frame defined by the conserved excitation number rotating at the field frequency , @xmath6 , by considering a time independent coupling , @xmath13 , and a time dependent detuning between the qubit and the field frequency given by the original landau - zener ( lz ) process , @xmath14 , it is possible to write a quantized lz , or lz - jc hamiltonian , in units of @xmath15 , @xmath16 where a scaled time @xmath17 and according coupling @xmath18 has been used .",
    "this particular choice of parameters means that the driving field is detuned to the blue of the qubit transition , @xmath19 ; the positive constant @xmath20 is just the steepness of the linear frequency ramp .",
    "choosing red detuning instead of blue is equivalent to replace @xmath21 in eq.([eq : qlzh ] ) .",
    "the crossing of the spectra is given at @xmath22 where resonance is reached as @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the quantized field frequency may be kept constant while adequately detuning the qubit transition .",
    "a superconducting qubit coupled to a strip line resonator @xcite may be described by the quantized lz hamiltonian in eq.([eq : qlzh ] ) when the transition frequency of the charge ( flux ) qubit is varied linearly in time by a driving charge ( magnetic flux ) leading to @xmath24 . furthermore , a circuit - qed implementation may allow the strong coupling needed to go beyond the rwa @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , our analysis of the strong coupling case will use the hamiltonian , in units of @xmath25 , @xmath26 where the transition frequency of the qubit is tuned by an external charge ( magnetic field ) to vary linearly in time as @xmath27 ; again , the positive constant @xmath28 is just the steepness of the driving ramp . in this model , the blue ( red ) detunning between the field and the qubit is provided by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , and resonant driving is obtained at @xmath31 .",
    "a bec in an asymmetric double well trap @xcite , where the depth of one of the wells is made to vary linearly in time , may be described by a nonlinear version of the standard two - level landau - zener process . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "classical dynamics of nonlinear lz tunneling in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) has been studied and separated tunneling defined by the fixed points of the system found @xcite .",
    "a two - modes bec driven by a quantized microwave field delivers a quantum version of the condensate in an asymmetric double - well model @xcite ; the modes may be defined by two hyperfine structures of the ground state of a given atomic species , the time dependent detuning is given by the detuning between the qubit transition frequency and the driving field , and the nonlinearity may be tuned down by feschbach resonances and neglected .",
    "such considerations deliver what we will call a landau - zener - dicke ( lzd ) hamiltonian , @xmath32 where the angular momentum basis related to angular momentum operators @xmath33 , with @xmath2 , describes the ensemble containing @xmath34 qubits .",
    "also , the model in eq.([eq : qlzd ] ) may describe the effective motion of a laser driven condensate , under the two - mode approximation , coupled to an optical cavity @xcite , when the detuning between the laser pump and cavity frequencies with respect to the difference between the energies of the two - lowest - momentum modes is set to vary linearly in time .",
    "while an approximate solution for the lz problem is known for the lzd model @xcite , an exact solution for its time evolution is feasible but , at least for the time being , we restrict our analysis to the models of the one qubit within and without the rotating wave approximation described by eq([eq : qlzh ] ) and eq([eq : lzch ] ) , respectively .",
