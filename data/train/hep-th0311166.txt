    "unlike their @xmath3 counterpart , however , these singular vectors formulas can give the vanishing result for some `` degenerate '' values of the highest - weight parameters ( this was noted in  @xcite ) .    because of this vanishing , it thus appears that the _ submodule _ otherwise generated from a chosen mff singular vector `` vanishes '' at some degenerate points in the highest - weight parameter space .",

    "the structure of submodules is reorganized at these special points of the parameter space , but the known mff formula does not provide us with an adequate tool for studying these degenerations .    in what follows , we propose a formula for the singular vectors ( which we still call the mff singular vectors ) involving only creation operators and therefore nonvanishing in a given verma module . _",
