    "correlations among the results of space - like separated measurements on composite quantum systems can be incompatible with a local model  @xcite . such phenomenon , known as _ quantum nonlocality _ , is an intrinsic quantum feature and lies behind several applications in quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "the majority of known results on quantum nonlocality refer to the bipartite scenario and , even though multipartite quantum correlations are a potential valuable resource for multiparty quantum information tasks , their characterization remains a general unsolved problem .",
    "the most common method to detect nonlocal correlations is through the violation of a bell inequality .",
    "it is however unclear whether the amount of violation quantifies nonlocality in a meaningful way @xcite . for the bipartite scenario , elitzur , popescu and",
    "rohrlich introduced a formalism for the study of nonlocality , named in what follows epr-2 , which naturally leads to a quantitative notion of nonlocality @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum state , @xmath0 , and a set of local measurements .",
    "the obtained joint probability distribution of outcomes reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 label the measurement settings , @xmath4 and @xmath5 the measurement outcomes , @xmath6 and @xmath7 the corresponding measurement operators .",
    "the main idea is to consider all possible decompositions of @xmath8 into a local and a nonlocal part  @xcite : @xmath9 the nonlocal distribution @xmath10 is in principle arbitrary , but it has to be no - signaling  @xcite since @xmath8 and @xmath11 have this property . for the given state @xmath0 , the goal is to identify the decomposition which maximizes the weight of the local part , @xmath12 , among all possible local measurements .",
    "the solution to this optimization problem , @xmath13 , is clearly a function of the state only and can be interpreted as a measure of its nonlocal correlations .    in the bipartite case ,",
    "some of the most basic questions on quantum nonlocality have been answered . in",
    "what follows it will be useful to express these findings in terms of the properties of the epr-2 decomposition  , namely of the weight @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , it is known that there exist mixed entangled states which are local or , equivalently , have @xmath14  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gisin s theorem proves that every pure entangled bipartite state violates a bell inequality , which means that they have @xmath15  @xcite . for families of two - qubit and two - qutrit pure states ,",
    "non - trivial bounds on the value of @xmath12 have been provided  @xcite .",
    "the same idea has been generalized to mixed states in ref .",
    "moreover , it is known that fully - nonlocal states exist , as maximally entangled states have @xmath16 @xcite .    moving to the multipartite scenario",
    ", we can find parallel results to those on bipartite quantum nonlocality .",
    "for instance , every pure entangled multipartite state violates a bell inequality  @xcite .",
    "also , no fraction of the statistics obtained by measuring any state manifesting a ghz - like paradox can be described by a completely local model  @xcite .",
    "however , these results say nothing about the presence of _ genuine multipartite _ nonlocal correlations , _ i.e.  _ those nonlocal correlations established between all the @xmath17-parties of a @xmath17-partite quantum state . in fact , very few steps were made in the characterization of genuine multipartite nonlocality . in 1987 , svetlichny provided the first bell inequality able to identify genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations  @xcite . much later",
    ", this result has been extended to @xmath17-partite genuine correlations  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the classification of nonlocal correlations according to various hybrid local - nonlocal models has been studied .    in this work",
    ", we present a general method to study multipartite nonlocality , including genuine multiparty , in the no - signaling scenario  @xcite .",
    "it is based on a multipartite version of the epr-2 decomposition and on the results of measurements held on a subset of the parties sharing a multipartite quantum state .",
    "our framework provides sufficient conditions to detect genuine multipartite full - nonlocal correlations , which we simply designate by _ multipartite fully - nonlocal _ , in opposition to the ( bipartite ) full - nonlocality mentioned previously .",
    "we are able to identify the completely - connected graph states @xcite as the first example of multipartite fully - nonlocal states , proving the existence of these states for any number of parties .",
    "furthermore , we prove that multipartite full - nonlocality can also be observed in the _ mixed _ case : the tensor product of five copies of the smolin state  @xcite is a multipartite fully - nonlocal mixed quantum state .",
    "in order to introduce the complex structure of correlations in a multipartite scenario , we start by considering a possible extension of the epr-2 decomposition for the tripartite case , @xmath18 with @xmath19 . here , the distribution @xmath20 is completely local @xcite and therefore it strictly contains classical correlations among the outcomes of the local measurements . on the other hand",
    "@xmath21 ( equivalently @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) represents a local - nonlocal hybrid model @xmath24 which was originally introduced by svetlichny  @xcite . we see that measurement results in @xmath25 are classically correlated to the results in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but nonlocal correlations are allowed between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that contrary to what happens in the bipartite case , the distributions appearing in the different nonlocal terms of the epr-2 decomposition   are arbitrary and may in principle allow signaling between the corresponding parties .",
    "however , here we work in the no - signaling scenario and , thus , all the terms appearing in the decomposition are assumed to be compatible with this principle .",
    "the intuition is that the parties can not signal even if they have access to the hidden - variable @xmath28 in  @xcite . finally , the component @xmath29 is the only to contain genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations .",
    "this decomposition can easily be extended to an arbitrary number of parties , @xmath17 .",
    "the richness of multipartite correlations expresses itself by the rapid growth of hybrid local - nonlocal terms with @xmath17 .",
    "observe how this multipartite version of the epr-2 decomposition clearly distinguishes bipartite from genuine @xmath17-partite quantum nonlocality . in order for a quantum state to violate a standard bell inequality it is sufficient that it has @xmath15 , while it violates a svetlichny inequality if and only if @xmath30 .",
    "analogously , bipartite full - nonlocality is present when @xmath16 but multipartite full - nonlocality is synonymous of the much stronger condition @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath32 is the relevant quantity when studying genuine multipartite nonlocality . in what follows",
    ", we focus our analysis on this quantity and provide a sufficient criterion to detect multipartite fully - nonlocal correlations .    for clarity ,",
    "let us rephrase some known results on multipartite nonlocality and stress the aim of the present work in terms of the generalized epr-2 decomposition .",
    "the fact that every multipartite pure entangled state violates a bell inequality  @xcite means that all of them have @xmath15 . as commented before",
    ", any state exhibiting a ghz - like paradox has @xmath16",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will provide a sufficient criterion for a multipartite state to have @xmath31 .",
    "this criterion identifies several multipartite pure quantum states , as well as a mixed one , as multipartite fully - nonlocal .",
    "to start , we introduce a different version of multipartite epr-2 decomposition , which focuses on the correlations across a specific bipartition of the composite system .",
    "consider a @xmath17-partite state @xmath0 and a bipartition @xmath33 , where @xmath34 contains @xmath35 parties and @xmath36 the remaining @xmath37 . to simplify the notation ,",
    "assume that @xmath34 contains the first @xmath35 parties and @xmath36 the @xmath37 remaining ones .",
    "measurement settings in each partition are labeled by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the respective outcomes are @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the new version of the multipartite epr-2 decomposition is then given by @xmath42 we use the subscript @xmath43 to indicate locality in the partition @xmath33 , although the distribution @xmath44 is hybrid , _ i.e.  _ @xmath45 and allows any no - signaling correlations among members of the same partition .",
    "the nonlocal component @xmath46 in contains all correlations not modeled by . among all possible decompositions ,",
    "we focus on the one maximizing the weight of the local part , @xmath47 .",
    "we then define full nonlocality with respect to the partition @xmath33 by @xmath48 .",
    "it is evident that this multipartite version strongly resembles the original bipartite epr-2 decomposition  : we will see that this generalized bipartite decomposition form is essential in the following derivation .    before showing how to detect multipartite fully - nonlocality",
    ", we must present a method to identify full - nonlocal correlations across a given bipartition of a @xmath17-partite quantum state .",
    "in fact , the following theorem constitutes the core of our results .    * theorem 1 . *",
    "an @xmath17-partite state @xmath0 is fully - nonlocal across a given bipartition @xmath33 ( @xmath49 ) , in the no - signaling scenario , if it is possible to create a maximally entangled state between one party in each partition , for _ all _ outcomes of suitable local measurements on the remaining parties  @xcite .    _",
    "proof : _ we are interested in showing that the outcome distribution of @xmath0 , in the epr-2 decomposition , has @xmath50 . from @xcite we know that any bipartite maximally entangled state is fully nonlocal , _",
    "i.e.  _ , @xmath16 . the proof of theorem 1 will then follow by contradiction : @xmath51 would imply @xmath52 for the maximally entangled state .",
    "indeed , assume there is a positive local weight @xmath51 . for ease of notation ,",
    "consider the case in which a maximally entangled state can be created between party @xmath53 , belonging to @xmath34 , and @xmath54 , belonging to @xmath36 , by local measurements in the remaining parties , @xmath55 .",
    "we label the measurement settings by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and their respective outcomes by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for every outcome @xmath60 ,",
    "parties @xmath53 and @xmath54 are projected onto the maximally entangled state @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ fig ] ) . given that we only consider no - signaling distributions",
    ", the following identity holds true for every component of the epr-2 decomposition  : @xmath62 this simply expresses the usual no - signaling condition : the outcome of measurements on parties @xmath63 can not depend on the choice of measurements by distant parties @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    since we assumed that @xmath51 , a fraction of the statistics of the state @xmath0 is modeled by the hybrid model .",
    "then , for every measurements choice @xmath64 on the @xmath65 parties , there is at least one outcome @xmath60 which the hybrid model predicts with non - zero probability : @xmath66 . the post - measurement state associated to this outcome , @xmath61 ,",
    "is maximally entangled by assumption and has correlations according to the induced epr-2 decomposition @xmath67 with local weight @xmath68 notice that the induced nonlocal distribution is well - defined because its only constraint , the no - signaling condition , is not affected @xcite .",
    "also , the fact that we can apply the no - signaling condition to every component of the hybrid model , guarantees that we obtain the valid induced hybrid distribution @xmath69 where the induced probability density is @xmath70 according to , the local weight @xmath12 is necessarily positive .",
    "this is known to be impossible since it corresponds to a maximally entangled state @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distribution for the state @xmath0 must be fully nonlocal on the partition @xmath71 , @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath72    an important remark on the previous result is that the proof is presented as a sequence of measurements only by clarity reasons .",
    "in fact , given that all measurements are performed on spatially - separated parties , the results of measurements on parties @xmath63 are guaranteed to be independent from the measurement choices of parties @xmath53 and @xmath54 by the no - signaling principle . therefore , there is no need to impose any time - ordering on the measuring events and we are in the most standard framework of nonlocality , which considers single local measurements in space - like separated systems .",
    "we are now ready to finally present the result which , combined with theorem 1 , provides the sufficient criterion to detect multipartite full - nonlocality",
    ".    * theorem 2 . *",
    "a probability distribution is multipartite fully - nonlocal ( @xmath31 ) if and only if it is fully nonlocal ( @xmath73 ) in every bipartition @xmath33 .    _",
    "proof : _ the proof proceeds again by contradiction .",
    "assume that @xmath74 .",
    "then , there is at least one local / hybrid model in the epr-2 decomposition with positive weight .",
    "however , there is always a bipartite splitting of the parties such that this term contributes to the corresponding local part in eq .  .",
    "but this is now in contradiction with the fact that @xmath73 for every bipartition . then , @xmath32 is equal to one for the initial distribution.@xmath72     of a @xmath17-partite state @xmath0 .",
    "if for every outcome of this partial measurement , @xmath53 and @xmath54 share a maximally entangled state , @xmath0 has @xmath75 ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "if it holds for any possible bipartition , the state @xmath0 is multipartite fully - nonlocal , @xmath31 .",
    "( theorem 2 ) ]",
    "from theorems 1 and 2 we can immediately identify the completely - connected graph states as being multipartite fully - nonlocal states .",
    "this comes from the fact that these states fulfill all the necessary requirements : for any pair of qubits , there are local pauli measurements on the remaining @xmath65 parties which project the pair of particles into a maximally entangled state for every measurement outcome  @xcite .",
    "graph states are known to possess several peculiar features like being perfect quantum channels for quantum communication , or ( some of them ) universal resources for measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the fact that completely - connected graph states are multipartite fully - nonlocal is one more interesting feature of this important class of multipartite entangled states .",
    "we now present the first known example of mixed state which contains multipartite fully - nonlocality .",
    "this example is based on the so - called smolin state , a four - partite bound entangled state given by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 denote the four bell states .",
    "the smolin state is biseparable among all two - qubit versus two - qubit partitions , and consequently no entanglement can be distilled from it by any local operations and classical communication .",
    "interestingly , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the combination of five of these states , namely @xmath78 is distillable . actually , ref .",
    "@xcite presents a distillation protocol which deterministically transforms @xmath79 into a singlet state between any pair of parties .",
    "we can then apply our sufficient criterion to conclude that @xmath79 has @xmath31 .",
    "this result proves the existence of mixed states which contain multipartite fully - nonlocal quantum correlations .",
    "we have seen how generalizations of the epr-2 decomposition for quantum probability distributions and outcomes of partial measurements on quantum systems can be used to study multipartite nonlocal correlations .",
    "our formalism gives sufficient conditions to detect multipartite full - nonlocality and identifies all completely - connected graph states as examples of multipartite fully - nonlocal states .",
    "this result solves a fundamental question concerning the characterization of nonlocal quantum correlations : in the no - signalling scenario , multipartite fully - nonlocal states exist for any number of parties .",
    "in addition , we also provide an example of such extreme nonlocality for a multipartite mixed state .",
    "finally , our work opens new questions on the characterization of multipartite nonlocality .",
    "would our conclusions be affected if the different terms appearing in the decomposition were not constrained by the no - signaling principle",
    "? providing this extra resource could give the hybrid models the ability to reproduce a fraction of the quantum probability distribution , and then full - nonlocality would be lost .",
    "another interesting open question is to characterize the set of all multipartite fully - nonlocal quantum states .",
