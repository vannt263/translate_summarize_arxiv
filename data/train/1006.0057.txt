    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) contain primary stars which are either neutron stars ( nss ) or black holes ( bhs ) and secondary stars typically less than 1  m@xmath0 .",
    "the low mass companion stars are usually main sequence or subgiant stars , and also include white dwarfs or substellar mass objects .",
    "the secondary transfers matter to the ns or bh primary via roche lobe overflow followed by disk accretion onto the primary .",
    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are a subset of lmxbs which spend most of their time in quiescence , and occasionally exhibit outbursts during which their luminosities increase by several orders of magnitude ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . during outbursts ,",
    "sxts go through a variety of `` canonical '' x - ray spectral states ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on their spectral and timing characteristics .",
    "the high / soft ( hs ) state corresponds to a relatively high luminosity , the x - ray spectrum dominated by a soft thermal component and @xmath1 rms variability .",
    "the low / hard ( lh ) state , on the other hand , is characterized by a relatively low luminosity , the spectrum dominated by a hard non - thermal power - law component and @xmath2 rms variability .",
    "there are also intermediate ( i m ) or very high ( vh ) states identified in the bh systems , of which the x - ray spectrum is composed of both a steep power - law component and a thermal component .",
    "sxts usually enter the hs state from the lh state during the rising phase of an outburst and return to the lh state during the outburst decay .",
    "past observations have also shown that a source can remain in the lh state throughout an outburst , which is usually of low luminosity @xcite .",
    "the most popular model for sxt outburst is the disk thermal instability ( dti ) model ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this model , for a certain range of surface density , the accretion disk can be either in a cool state where the gas is neutral or in a hot state where the gas is ionized . in the cool state the mass is accumulated in the disk until a surface density threshold is reached , above which only the hot state is possible . an outburst",
    "is then triggered , and the matter stored in the disk is accreted by the compact object .",
    "although the model is generally adopted , diverse outburst properties are seen in the same source during different outbursts , suggesting that the sxt outbursts are complex .",
    "if during an outburst the compact star accretes all of the material stored in the accretion disk , the total output energy of the outburst should be proportional to the mass in the accretion disk , assuming that the radiative efficiencies of accretion process among different outbursts remain the same .",
    "if the outburst profiles are comparable and the peak luminosity is scaled to the total output energy during outburst , we expect a correlation between the outburst peak luminosity and the disk mass among outbursts .",
    "previous x - ray observations have shown that this is probably true . in the special black hole transient gx  339@xmath34 , an empirical linear relation between the peak flux of the lh state at the beginning of an outburst and the outburst waiting time since the previous outburst , and a correlation between the peak flux of the lh state during an outburst rise and the outburst peak flux were found @xcite .",
    "actually the latter , namely the correlation between the luminosity of lh - to - hs state transition and the peak luminosity of the following hs state , has been confirmed for about 20 persistent and transient galactic x - ray binaries in a luminosity range spanning by 2 orders of magnitude @xcite . combining the two correlations",
    ", we expect a positive correlation between the outburst peak luminosity and the mass stored in the disk responsible for a certain outburst .",
    "the maximal mass that can be stored in the disk before an outburst is limited by the size of the roch - lobe in these lmxbs .",
    "the size of the roch - lobe is reflected in the orbital period ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the binary separation is given by @xmath4 based on the kepler s law , and the roche geometry is further determined by the binary separation and the mass ratio of the primary and the secondary ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in various models ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in general a longer @xmath4 indicates a larger radius allowed for the disk .",
    "the properties of the secondary for a given @xmath4 are predicted by binary evolution theory .",
    "the mean density @xmath5 of the secondary which fills its roche lobe satisfies the approximate relation of @xmath6 g @xmath7 , in which @xmath8 is @xmath4 in the unit of hours @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms driving the mass transfer in the binaries are different for different @xmath4 , which could be the expansion of the donor as it evolves away from the main sequence , or the loss of orbital angular momentum through gravitational radiation or magnetic braking ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amount of mass in the accretion disk has been suspected to increase with increasing @xmath4 and primary mass ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "similar study was also performed by @xcite with the peak luminosity taken from @xcite ( hereafter csl97 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the theoretical relations between @xmath4 , the mass in the disk and the outburst peak luminosity can only hold in an average sense since sxt outburst varies from one to another , and the eddington limit on the outburst peak luminosities in both the lh state and the hs state would cause a flat top of the outburst peak luminosity because of luminosity saturation , although this probably has not been seen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "ns masses are not well measured in the transient lmxbs studied here .",
    "common understanding is that nss have a canonical mass of about 1.4  m@xmath0 , but recent studies showed evidences for larger neutron star masses in a few systems  up to around 2  m@xmath0 ( e.g. , @xmath16  m@xmath0 for vela  x-1 , @xcite ; @xmath17  m@xmath0 for 4u  1700 - 37 , @xcite ; @xmath18  m@xmath0 for aql  x-1 , @xcite ) .",

    "the best - fitting result is ( shown in the lower left panel in figure  [ fitlin ] ) @xmath31 and the reduced @xmath32 .",

    "this model is used to describe the empirical relation of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for bh x - ray binaries in @xcite .",
    "the constant represents upper boundary for the transient luminosity . under this model fit , if the break period is not constrained , the best - fitting value of this parameter turns out to be very large , making it essentially a pure linear model .",
    "if we fixed the break period as 10  h as in @xcite , the best - fitting model can be expressed as ( shown in the lower right panel in figure  [ fitlin ] ) @xmath38 and the reduced @xmath39 .",
    "we found that the linear model describes the relation best among the three models , in spite of the plausible deviations .",
    "our fits do not support that there exists a break orbital period , or a saturated luminosity .",
    "the longest orbital period systems can be pushed up to eddington luminosity or perhaps slightly above the eddington luminosity , depending on the bolometric corrections .",
    "we tried to investigate whether there is a systematic luminosity offset between bhs and nss .",
    "we fixed the slope at 0.63 , the best - fitting value for the overall data , and fit the data of bhs and nss respectively .",
    "the results are shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ fitlin ] .",
    "the intercepts are @xmath40 for bhs and @xmath41 for nss .",
    "they are consistent with being the same .",
    "we noticed that in the regime where @xmath4 is less than 4h , there are only ns sources , mostly apmsps .",
    "we then fit the ns sources with @xmath4 larger than 4  h and got @xmath42 .",
    "again , the intercepts of bhs and the nss are consistent with the same .",
    "the absence of bh systems in the small @xmath4 regime may indicate that a bh system with a small @xmath4 tends to have outbursts with peak fluxes below the sensitivity of the x - ray monitoring missions in the past decade .",
    "this then implies that a systematic luminosity offset between the bhs and the nss at low @xmath4 may exist , which is in the luminosity regime of below @xmath43 @xmath24 .",
    "we also studied the relation of the lh state peak luminosity @xmath44 vs. the orbital period @xmath4 , and the hs state peak luminosity @xmath45 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "we could not determine whether the peak luminosity of the lh state is positively correlated with @xmath4 , probably because we lack the coverage of _ rxte _ pointed observations .",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath20 tends to be larger for systems with longer @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite studied disk instability in sxts and concluded that an accreting ns or bh system tends to be transient if the average mass transfer rate is below a critical value which increases with @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that we tend to see transient sources with a larger @xmath4 at a higher average mass accretion rate . for most of the sources in our sample ,",
    "the number of outbursts detected in the past decade are about a few .",
    "their recurrence times should not differ too much and are roughly on the same order of magnitude .",
    "the outburst peak luminosity is expected to correlate with the average mass accretion rate for the sources we studied .",
    "therefore we are likely to see a positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath4 if the eddington limit is not reached .",
    "the trend is also expected from the theoretical calculation of @xcite .",
    "they showed that the light curves of sxts can be explained by disk instability if taking into account of irradiation by the central x - ray source during the outburst .",
    "if the luminosity is high , irradiation will be strong enough to ionize the entire disk and the x - ray light curve would be roughly an exponential decay . if the x - ray flux is too weak to ionize the whole disk , the outburst light curve should be roughly a linear decay .",
    "based on ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) in @xcite , the peak luminosities for an outburst with an exponential decay and linear decay can be calculated as @xmath46 respectively . here @xmath47 is the maximal ionized disk radius in units of @xmath48  cm , which is roughly the maximum of the outer disk radius , usually taken as the tidal radius of the disk and estimated as @xmath49 of the primary s roche lobe radius . according to @xcite",
    ", the primary s roche lobe radius can be calculated by the approximate analytic formula @xmath50 in which @xmath51 is the mass ratio between the secondary and the primary @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the binary separation which can be conveniently expressed in the form @xmath54 assuming @xmath55 and combining the above equations , we get @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the primary mass in units of solar mass , and @xmath58 is the orbital period in units of hour .",
    "we plot the theoretical results as solid lines in figure  [ theory ] together with the peak luminosities we measured .",
    "no source is observed beyond the maximal peak luminosity . at short @xmath4",
    ", @xmath22 tends to be close to the theoretical peak luminosity corresponding to an outburst with an exponential decay , indicating that the disks in these systems are likely entirely irradiated .",
    "systems with longer @xmath4 have @xmath22 close to the theoretical peak luminosity for a linear decay , probably because the disk in these systems are large and only the inner parts of the disks are irradiated .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "orbital period and peak luminosity in eddington unit generally follow a positive correlation , whereas xte  j1118 + 480 is a outlier .",
    "its 3200  kev peak luminosity is only about @xmath59 , one order of magnitude lower than the other sources with similar @xmath4 .",
    "the source is the bh sxt known with the shortest @xmath4 and almost the shortest distance , which remained in the lh state throughout the outburst we observed . during the outburst",
    ", it showed strong non - thermal radiation in the radio to optical band and a very low x - ray to optical flux ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another even fainter outburst was observed in january , 2005 @xcite , which proves that such faint outburst is not occasional but typical for xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "several physical interpretations have been proposed for this source , involving the radiative inefficient accretion flow @xcite , jet synchrotron radiation in the lh state @xcite and jet - disk coupling @xcite .",
    "a popular idea is that the bolometric correction to its luminosity would be much larger than those for other sources which stayed in the lh state throughout an outburst .",
    "however , @xmath20 of xte  j1118 + 480 is rather low even compared with the brightest lh state luminosities of other sources ( figure  [ lhlum ] ) , which suggests alternative interpretations .",
    "one possibility is that the radiative efficiency for systems far from the critical luminosity of state transitions is lower than that for the brightest lh state systems  the advection dominated accretion flow model , for example , gives @xmath60 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this model applies to xte j1118 + 480 , then the radiative efficiency of this system might be a factor of @xmath61 smaller than the other black hole systems , putting its mass accretion rate much closer to the other systems than its luminosity .      in figure  [ peaklum ]",
    "the complex phenomena below 4  h can be noticed : the peak luminosities for sources with orbital period between 24  h namely igr  j00291 + 5934 ( `` a '' ) , exo  0748 - 676 ( `` b '' ) , xte  j1710 - 281 ( `` f '' ) and xte  j1814 - 338 ( `` l'')drop suddenly ; while among the three sources with @xmath62  h , xte  j1751 - 305 ( `` i '' ) has a lower limit of @xmath20 which is one order of magnitude larger than those between 24  h , and the other two might have higher @xmath20 but accurate distance measurements are not available . it is an interesting question whether the ultra - compact x - ray binary with orbital period smaller than 1  h can reach higher peak luminosity than the source in the period range of 24  hours .    only according to this work , the evidences are not conclusive due to the below considerations . in the first place",
    "the number of sources is not enough in statistics , and their masses and distances are quite uncertain .",
    "for example the distance of xte  j0929 - 314 ( `` c '' ) , indicated as @xmath63  kpc in lph07 , seems to lack of solid observational basis .",
    "secondly for very close binaries the donor stars are likely to be hydrogen depleted , so that their eddington luminosities are different from those in wider systems  in which accreting matter is hydrogen  by a factor of a few . as a result @xmath20 plotted here",
    "are not the actual values for the ultra - compact binaries .",
    "thirdly we notice that all the three unltra - compact binaries with orbital period lower than 1  h are apmsps . there may be a selection effect at short orbital period regime since the short period were determined from x - ray pulse arrival times(e.g .",
    "at the same time these x - ray pulsars are very likely with non - isotropic emission from the polar region in addition to disk emission , and their apparent luminosities to the observer have a systematic increment .",
    "lastly the low outburst peak luminosities observed in sources with orbital periods of several hours might be accidental .",
    "for example , igr  j00291 + 5934 ( `` a '' ) has a radio counterpart @xcite that indicates an outflow , which is likely radiatively inefficient .",
    "in addition , it might be at a larger distance than we thought ( 710  kpc , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "both factors would cause the low luminosity ",
    "the former by reducing the intrinsic luminosity and the latter by underestimating the conversion factor from flux to lumniosity .",
    "another example is exo  0748 - 676 ( `` b '' ) .",
    "it has been observed with x - ray dips @xcite ; strong inclination effects may cause a lower luminosity as well .",
    "all the above factors would cause the ultra - compact binaries appear brighter than we expected from the empirical linear relation .",
    "just based on our work it might be premature to claim that @xmath20 in unltra compact binary system is essentially higher than that in the system not so compact .",
    "however it is a problem worthy of further investigation , because additional accretion stream component or slightly different accretion geometry might exist in ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting investigation is a comparison of bh and ns systems . @xcite and @xcite studied the quiescent luminosities of ns and bh sxts as a function of @xmath4 , and found systematically higher quiescent luminosities for ns sxts .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the former has a hard surface and the later has an event horizon instead .",
    "however , further studies show that at least some of the ns sxts can be as faint as bh sxts in quiescence ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in our study",
    ", we found no significant difference in the outburst peak luminosities between bhs and nss systems at similar @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that the radiative efficiencies of the accretion flows around nss and bhs during the outburst peaks are comparable , probably except for the case of xte  j1118 + 480 discussed above .",
    "it is worth noting that all the bh transients we studied have an orbital period larger than @xmath23 4h .",
    "significant difference in the radiation efficiencies between bh systems and ns systems at low luminosities and at small orbital periods can not be ruled out .",
    "bh transient systems with @xmath64h should have very faint outbursts .",
    "because for short @xmath4 sxts , they should have low mass transfer rate in order to remain as transients @xcite , about @xmath65 or below for bhs towards small @xmath4 ( @xmath66h ) . at such a low mass accretion rate",
    ", the accretion flow would be radiatively inefficient and the observed luminosity is far less than @xmath67 .",
    "therefore the bh systems are expected dimmer than the ns systems at short @xmath4 .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 , which is the faintest ( @xmath68 , much smaller than other bhs ) as well as the shortest - period bh in our sample , shows some evidence of radiatively inefficient accretion .",
    "this implies that few bh systems with an orbital period below 4h are observed may be the result of radiatively inefficient flow at low mass accretion rate in bh systems .",
    "evidence for the connection between the mass in the accretion disk when an outburst occurs and the peak luminosity of an outburst can be inferred from the observations of black hole transient gx  339 - 4 @xcite . for the same compact star mass and companion mass in a lmxb , @xmath4 indicates the size of the roche lobe .",
    "the mass stored in the accretion disk during quiescence is then limited by the size of the roche lobe .",
    "we show that there is an overall positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath4 in transient lmxbs .",
    "this supports the idea that there is a correlation between the outburst peak luminosity and the initial mass in the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "a positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath4 therefore strengthens that the mass in the accretion disk affects the outburst properties .",
    "indeed , theoretical studies of sxt outbursts have shown that a positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath4 exist for certain model parameters @xcite .",
    "taking into account that there is a correlation between the lh - to - hs transition luminosity , the rate - of - change of luminosity , and outburst peak luminosity in x - ray binaries @xcite , the mass in the accretion disk seems the most important parameter that sets up the accretion processes during outbursts .",
    "as shown above , the relation between the allowed maximal outer disk radius @xmath69 and @xmath58 can be approximated as @xmath70 .",
    "the best - fitting linear model in the logarithmic axis gives @xmath71 .",
    "combining them we obtained @xmath72 , which indicate a nearly linear relation between the eddington - scaled maximal peak luminosity and the allowed maximal outer disk radius .",
    "this is an interesting result and might provide constraints for some certain theoretical models and physical parameters . if total energy fluence of outburst is measured and total mass accreted to the compact star is estimated , the threshold of disk surface density for triggering outburst can be constrained .",
    "we studied the relation between the outburst peak luminosity and the orbital period in transient lmxbs .",
    "we analyzed the pca / hexte spectra of 25 lmxbs whose outburst peaks had been covered by _",
    "rxte _ pointed observations , and measured the peak flux of the brightest outburst of each source in the energy range between 3200  kev .",
    "we then estimated the luminosities in eddington unit as well as their uncertainties .",
    "the maximal luminosity of the lh and hs state were also studied as well .",
    "we found that @xmath20 on the whole is higher for sources with larger @xmath4 , showing no sign of luminosity saturation expected when approaching the eddington limit towards larger @xmath4 .",
    "we fitted the relation in the logarithmic scale with three models : a straight line model , a step function model and a straight line connected with a constant model .",
    "the linear relation can well describe the data .",
    "we find the theoretic work by @xcite is quantitatively consistent with the relation of peak luminosity and orbital period we obtained .",
    "the contrast at short orbital period regime might indicate that the ultra - compact binaries have unexpected higher luminosities which , however , is not conclusive only based on our study due to a number of observational uncertainties .",
    "we have also compared @xmath20 of ns and bh sxts , and found that generally there is no significant difference between them",
    ". therefore radiative efficiencies of the accretion flows are comparable for ns and bh with similar @xmath4 during outburst peaks .",
    "since we have not seen bh systems with @xmath4 less than 4h , it is possible that bh transients with short @xmath4 have lower outburst peak luminosities than the ns systems , because the accretion flow might be radiative inefficient at low mass accretion rate .",

    "<S> we also find that there is no significant difference in the 3200  kev outburst peak luminosity between neutron star systems and black hole systems with orbital periods above 4h ; however , there might be significant difference at smaller orbital period where only neutron star systems are observed and radiatively inefficient accretion flow is expected to work at the low luminosities for black hole accreters . </S>"
