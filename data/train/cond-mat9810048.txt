    "in a pioneering work fermi , pasta and ulam  @xcite showed that in a hamiltonian system with _ short - range _ interactions the relaxation time to thermodynamical equilibrium can be extremely long if the energy is small enough .",
    "this striking feature triggered an intense research activity and , nowadays , the relation between macroscopic thermodynamical properties and microscopic dynamics is actively investigated in a large variety of physical systems  @xcite .",
    "the common belief that microcanonical time averages coincide with equilibrium ensemble averages after a possibly quite long transient is confirmed by several numerical experiments ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . therefore , although the rigorous proof of _ ergodicity _ is restricted to a few rather abstract dynamical systems ( e.g. the sinai billiard ) , it is nevertheless believed , and confirmed numerically  @xcite , that time averages of thermodynamic functions ( temperature , internal energy , specific heat ) converge to their equilibrium values , at least in the regime of strong chaos .",
    "the case of _ long - range _ forces is quite less explored from this point of view .",
    "the study of relaxation to thermal equilibrium is here made more complex by the consequences of the _ inequivalence of statistical ensembles_. indeed , it is well known that the impossibility to isolate a small sub - system from a large thermal bath , due to the presence of long - range forces , prevents the derivation of _ canonical _ from _ microcanonical _ ensemble .",
    "exactly solvable toy models  @xcite with weak long - range forces explicitly display ensemble inequivalence and the presence of _ negative specific heat _ in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "similar phenomena were also obtained for gravitational models  @xcite .",
    "these toy models show a _ first order phase - transition _ in the canonical ensemble , which corresponds to the presence of a concave region of the entropy - energy curve in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this feature is present also in microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations of _ short - range _ models without hard - core  @xcite , where one observes , in the phase - transition region , a high - density _ clustered _ phase coexisting with a low - density _ gaseous _ phase .",
    "more recently , microcanonical monte - carlo simulations have shown similar properties for the diluted three - state potts model  @xcite .",
    "all the previous remarks concern _ equilibrium _ properties , but it is known that long - range interacting systems show also extremely slow relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "a remarkable example is the one - dimensional self - gravitating potential , where the study of long transients and quasi - equilibria has been undertaken by many groups  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a scaling law for the relaxation to equilibrium has been proposed for gravitational systems based on diffusion in phase - space  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model  @xcite has been introduced with the aim of studying _ clustering _ phenomena in @xmath0-body systems in one dimension .",
    "the original motivation was to consider a truncated fourier series development of the one - dimensional gravitational and charged sheet models .",
    "its canonical ensemble exact solution predicts a _ second - order _ phase transition from a clustered phase to a gaseous one .",
    "hmf is an _ infinite range _ interacting system and",
    "one would naturally expect unusual thermodynamical behaviour .",
    "however , microcanonical simulations of hmf show that  carefully \" prepared initial states lead to a good agreement with canonical analytical results for the energy - temperature relation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    " water bag \" initial states , _ ie . _ states with momentum distribution on a finite support , are _ metastable _ and show an extremely slow relaxation to equilibrium near the critical energy  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive analytically the entropy - energy relation of the hmf model in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "we further study the properties of metastable states corresponding to the low energy extension of the high energy gaseous phase .",
    "the relaxation time of these states to canonical equilibrium is also investigated , showing that it increases linearly with the number of particles @xmath0 near the critical energy .",
    "the hamiltonian mean field model describes the dynamics of @xmath0 classical and identical particles confined to move on the unit circle  @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian writes @xmath1 where @xmath2",
    "are canonically conjugated coordinate and momentum variables with @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the kinetic energy and the potential energy @xmath5 corresponds to the first harmonic of the one - dimensional self - gravitating potential @xmath6 ( up to scaling constants ) .",
    "total momentum @xmath7 is also conserved and always set to zero without loss of generality .    in",
    "the _ canonical _ ensemble , model ( [ ham ] ) undergoes a second - order phase transition at the inverse temperature value @xmath8  @xcite , corresponding to a critical specific energy @xmath9 .",

    "the maximization of @xmath15 is performed by solving the consistency equation @xmath16 whose unique solution at small @xmath17 is @xmath18 , while at large @xmath17 , _ ie .",
    "_ low temperature , a pair of symmetric non vanishing solutions is present .",
    "the bifurcation ( of pitchfork type ) occurs at @xmath19 and at this temperature the value of the free energy f has a discontinuity in the second order derivative , which is the signature of a second - order phase transition .",
    "this is also confirmed by the calculation of the order parameter @xmath20 which vanishes continuously at @xmath21 , remaining zero in the whole high temperature phase . at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath22 measures the degree of clustering of the particles .",
    "the equations of motion derived from model ( [ ham ] ) , written in terms of @xmath23 , show that each particle has a pendulum like motion @xmath24 which makes explicit the self - consistent nature of the dynamics , since each particle moves in the m - field , which is itself determined by the position @xmath25 of all the particles .",
    "this has led  @xcite to the interpretation of the phase transition as a dynamical process of particle evaporation from the cluster . moreover",
    ", this approach follows the idea that the study of self - consistent @xmath0-body dynamics is simplified by an  effective \" reduction of the number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the free energy @xmath26 in the canonical ensemble is readily computed once one knows the dependence of entropy @xmath27 on specific energy @xmath28 in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "one begins from the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the microcanonical phase - space density at energy @xmath31 .",
    "the lower limit of the integral in ( [ part ] ) is given by the energy of the ground state , which vanishes in our model ( in this case all of the particles are at the same position with zero momentum ) .",
    "after rescaling by @xmath0 and exponentiating @xmath32 eq . ( [ part ] ) becomes @xmath33 this integral is then solved by the saddle - point technique in the @xmath34 limit , which implies taking the maximum of the argument of the exponential .",
    "using the definition of entropy @xmath35   \\label{ent}\\ ] ] and recalling the definition of free energy ( [ free ] ) , one finally gets @xmath36~.    \\label{legendre}\\ ] ] entropy @xmath27 and free energy @xmath37 are thus related by a legendre transform . _ assuming _ now that @xmath27 is concave ( _ i.e. _ downward bended ) , one can invert ( [ legendre ] ) and obtain @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{inv_legendre}\\ ] ] this assumption is not innocent and the invertion ( [ inv_legendre ] ) can be safely used only for second order phase - transitions , as it is for our model . on the contrary",
    ", it is well known that for first - order phase transitions entropy has a concave region  @xcite , which is responsible for the negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "a generalization of model ( [ ham ] ) to particle motion on the two - dimensional torus  @xcite does have a first - order phase transition , making the invertion impossible in this case .",
    "the calculation of entropy in the microcanonical ensemble is then reduced to the min - max procedure @xmath39~ ,    \\label{solution2}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 given by ( [ var ] ) .",
    "for @xmath40 the _ max _ is at @xmath18 and the _ min _ at @xmath41 , which gives the entropy function @xmath42 this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with full line above @xmath43 and with dashed line for @xmath44 ( below @xmath45 the temperature @xmath46 becomes negative and the solution meaningless ) .",
    "this solution corresponds to the high temperature homogeneous phase ( @xmath47 ) with @xmath48 for @xmath49 and to the _ metastable _ ( the meaning is clarified below ) homogeneous phase @xmath50 below @xmath51 .",
    "both phases are present also in the canonical solution and while in this latter context the @xmath50 corresponds to a local , but not global , minimum of the free energy , in the microcanonical context the entropy of the @xmath50 is not maximal .",
    "indeed , the solution which maximizes the entropy bifurcates continuously from this one at @xmath51 . below this energy the equilibrium solution is related to the two symmetric solutions with @xmath52 of the consistency equation ( [ consistency ] ) .",
    "they give the new maximum value of @xmath15 in ( [ solution2 ] ) and the numerical search of the minimum in @xmath17 , which is unique , allows to compute the stable branch of @xmath53 below @xmath51 .",
    "the latter is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with the continuous line and labelled @xmath54 , because it corresponds to the clustered phase , which is characterized by a non vanishing value of @xmath22 .",
    "the temperature @xmath55 can also be derived from the standard relation @xmath56 and is reported in fig .",
    "the stable solution @xmath53 ( full line ) is continuous with its derivative .",
    "the discontinuity is in the second derivative , which gives a jump in the specific heat @xmath57 .    _ to summarize , our results suggest that the microcanonical solution is fully consistent with the one in the canonical ensemble , and we can therefore conclude that the two ensembles lead to equivalent results for model ( [ ham ] ) . _",
    "however , the dynamics reveals a quite peculiar behavior of the microcanonical _ metastable _ branch . we have performed numerical simulations in microcanonical fixed - energy conditions by integrating the equations of motion ( [ ham2 ] ) , starting from appropriately chosen initial states . we have used a fourth order symplectic algorithm  @xcite with a time step @xmath58 , allowing relative energy conservation as good as @xmath59 .",
    "we have checked the energy - temperature curve , definining temperature as twice the time average of the kinetic energy : @xmath60 . the equilibrium energy - temperature solution is reached from generic initial states over most part of the energy range . however , for @xmath44 relaxation to equilibrium",
    "becomes very slow .",
    "we have started the runs in this range with the particles homogeneously distributed on the circle ( @xmath48 ) and with a `` water bag '' momentum distribution : the momenta are uniformly distributed in an interval around zero such that the variance of the distribution coincides initially with the temperature of the _ metastable _ branch @xmath61 .    the relaxation of the initial `` water bag '' to the equilibrium state proceeds through the slow development of maxwellian tails in the velocity distribution . in the literature one can already find indications that the relaxation time to equilibrium grows linearly with @xmath0  @xcite ( the authors used as a criterion the convergence to the boltzmann entropy of the maxwellian ) .",
    "we have decided to consider directly the time evolution of the temperature of the @xmath50 states .",
    "the initial temperature lies below the equilibrium one ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and relaxes to a fixed threshold temperature @xmath62 after a time @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the threshold amplitude and @xmath65 is the microcanonical equilibrium temperature represented by the full line in fig .",
    "considering different initial states , we have observed that the fluctuations of @xmath63 are poissonian and that a well defined average exists .",
    "this average relaxation time @xmath66 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath67 as a function of @xmath0 for different values of @xmath68 . for @xmath69",
    ", @xmath66 is almost independent of @xmath0 whereas for larger values of @xmath68 , @xmath66 increases approximately as @xmath0 .",
    "nothing substantially changes using different thresholds by changing the value of @xmath70 .",
    "we are therefore able to confirm , for a different observable and a better statistics ( we have considered up to 3600 initial conditions for the points in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on the linear divergence of the relaxation time with @xmath0 , at least in a restricted energy interval just below @xmath51 .",
    "the existence of such divergence implies that performing the @xmath34 limit before the @xmath71 limit , the system will stay indefinitely out of equilibrium and the momentum distribution will never develop maxwellian tails .",
    "this has attracted the attention of tsallis  @xcite , who argues that his entropy definition should be appropriate to describe the thermodynamical properties of such _",
    "metastable _ states in the thermodynamic limit ( in particular it would possibly describe the power law tails of the momentum distribution ) .",
    "it should however be remarked that what we have tested here is not the divergence of the _ lifetime _ of such states , but that of the relaxation time . however , recent numerical simulations performed by rapisarda  @xcite seem to indicate also the divergence of the lifetime with @xmath0 , encouraging tsallis interpretation .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to prepare states on the metastable branch which have initially a maxwellian momentum distribution and those states are observed to relax to equilibrium pretty fast .",
    "it seems that the  water bag \" condition , which corresponds to an initial truncation of the tails , is a necessary one for obtaining a divergence of the relaxation time .",
    "let us summarize what we have found .",
    "the _ microcanonical _ solution of the hamiltonian mean field model is here obtained with legendre transform techniques , which avoid state counting .",
    "the entropy is computed using a min - max procedure and the energy - temperature relation is derived analytically .",
    "the equilibrium states are shown to coincide with the _ canonical _ ones in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this result is not obvious since , due to the long - range interparticle coupling , ensemble equivalence might have been violated . besides the equilibrium solutions ,",
    "other states are found , corresponding to the _ metastable _ homogeneous configurations lying below the critical energy .",
    "the study of their relaxation time to equilibrium exihibits a divergence proportional to the number of particles , meaning that in the thermodynamic limit the trajectory in the phase - space remains indefinitely trapped in a non - equilibrium region ( something similar to so - called  mechanical \" initial states for the fermi - pasta - ulam model in ref .",
    "further investigations are necessary to understand the relevance of the metastable states for other more realistic long - range forces , beginning with the very interesting extension of the hmf proposed by tsallis and co - workers  @xcite , whose canonical solution has been recently obtained in ref .",
    "these results could be relevant for the physics of self - gravitating systems and for nuclear dynamics , where long - range forces play a distinctive role .",
