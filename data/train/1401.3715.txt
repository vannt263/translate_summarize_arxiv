    "in a recent paper @xcite we started the study of a coagulation model first considered in @xcite which we have called the redner  ben - avraham  kahng cluster system ( rbk for short ) .",
    "this is the infinite - dimensional ode system @xmath2 with symmetric positive coagulation coefficients @xmath3 .",
    "as with the discrete smoluchowski s coagulation system @xcite this is a mean - field model describing the evolution of a system given at each instant by a sequence @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 is the density of @xmath6-clusters for each integer @xmath6 , undergoing a binary reaction described by a bilinear infinite - dimensional vector field .",
    "however , while in the smoluchowski s coagulation model one @xmath7-cluster reacts with one @xmath6-cluster producing one @xmath8-cluster , in rbk the interaction between such clusters produce one @xmath9-cluster .",
    "if we assume that there is no destruction of mass , in the former model it makes sense to think of @xmath6 as the size , or mass , of each @xmath6-cluster .",
    "however in rbk the situation is different since with the same interpretation there would be a loss of mass in each reaction .",
    "hence , it makes more sense to think of @xmath6 as the size of the cluster ` active part ' , being the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath10 the size of the resulting cluster that becomes inactive for the reaction process .",

    "the nonexistence of a mass conservation property in rbk model makes for one of the major differences with respect to the smoluchowski s model . also , unlike in this one , in rbk a @xmath6 and a @xmath7-cluster react to produce a @xmath11-cluster with @xmath12 , implying that to an initial condition with an upper bound @xmath13 for the subscript values @xmath6 for which @xmath14 there corresponds a solution with the same property for all instants @xmath15 .",

    "it is clear that theorem [ theo ] by itself is unsufficient to answer this question since the passage to the limit , @xmath289 , is not allowed without results on the uniformity of the various limits involved , which seems to be a hard task .",
    "also it is far from clear how to rebuild the proofs of the lemmas in section [ lemmas ] in this more general case since they heavily rely on the fact that there is a ` last equation ' , the @xmath13-component equation , that can be integrated by the reduction method we have used , being the asymptotic behaviour of the other components deduced in a ` backwards ' manner .",
    "such procedure is obviously impossible in an infinite dimensional setting .",
    "in fact , that the situation can be very different for @xmath288 from the one displayed by theorem [ theo ] is shown by the existence of the self - similar solutions given by , @xmath290 with constants @xmath291 and @xmath292 ( see @xcite ) , in which case , @xmath293 , as @xmath0 , for @xmath294 .",
