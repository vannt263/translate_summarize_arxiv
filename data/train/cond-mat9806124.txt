    "the use of mode coupling theory ( mct ) is one of the most important attempts to describe the _ structural _ glass transition .",
    "restricted to _",
    "simple _ liquids , it has provided an equation of motion for the normalized density correlator @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the corresponding static correlation function .",
    "mct , in its _",
    "idealized _ version , interprets the glass transition as a dynamical transition at a critical temperature @xmath9 ( or critical density @xmath10 ) from a ergodic ( supercooled liquid ) to a nonergodic phase ( glass ) . in the latter phase",
    "the density @xmath11 does not approach its equilibrium value @xmath12 in the long time limit , i.e. the correlation function @xmath13 of the density fluctuations @xmath14 does not decay to zero for @xmath15 .",
    "therefor one can use the nonergodicity parameter ( nep ) @xmath16 as an order parameter for the glass transition .",
    "@xmath17 vanishes above and becomes nonzero at @xmath9 . in the long time limit",
    "@xmath18 the mct ",
    "equations involve only @xmath8 as an input quantity . here",
    ", @xmath19 is a microscopic time of order @xmath20 sec .",
    "this fact demonstrates the _ microscopic _ nature of mct , because @xmath8 can be calculated from the potential energy @xmath21 which only depends on the microscopic configuration \\ { @xmath22 } of the particles .",
    "the discussion of the mct ",
    "equations for t in the vicinity of @xmath9 leads to several interesting predictions for the time and temperature dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "however , due to the existence of ergodicity restoring processes in real glass formers below @xmath9 , which are taken into account by the _ extended _ mct , the transition is smeared out .",
    "nevertheless , a couple of experimental and numerical investigations have clearly shown the validity of several predictions of idealized mct . for more details",
    "the reader may consult the reviews  @xcite .",
    "these tests of idealized mct ( simple liquids ) were mainly _ qualitative _ , i.e. the validity of the asymptotic power laws for the @xmath23 and @xmath24relaxation regimes was studied .",
    "only very few _ quantitative _ test exist , which is , besides the calculation of the critical temperature ( or critical density ) , the q  dependence of the critical nep @xmath25 at @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) and the critical amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "this was done for a monoatomic  @xcite ( only @xmath9 was determined ) and binary lennard  jones liquid  @xcite , for a hard sphere  @xcite and a soft sphere system  @xcite and for the molecular liquids orthoterphenyl  @xcite and water  @xcite . although the two latter liquids contain orientational degrees of freedom ( odof ) , the analysis of the experimental  @xcite and numerical results  @xcite was done in the framework of mct for _ simple _ liquids , which does not account for the odof . a first attempt to include odof and their coupling to the translational degrees of freedom ( tdof )",
    "has recently been made for water  @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest a semi ",
    "schematic model where the full q  dependence is considered , but the influence of the odof is condensed in a single parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the phenomenological introduction of @xmath27 can be viewed as a `` renormalisation '' of the mode coupling strength for the tdof ( center of mass ) .    because most of the glass formers are of molecular origin , it is important to extend mct to _ molecular _ liquids .",
    "this has recently been done for a single dumb - bell molecule in an isotropic liquid  @xcite , for linear molecules  @xcite and arbitrary molecules  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will perform a quantitative test of the molecular mct for a liquid of rigid diatomic molecules by comparing the corresponding nonergodicity parameters as obtained from a recent md  simulation with those from molecular mct .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "the next section contains a descripition of the molecular mct ",
    "equations for linear molecules .",
    "the diatomic liquid and the computational details are described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains the comparison between mct and numerical results and the final section presents a summary and some conclusions .",
    "in this section we give a short summary of the application of mct to molecular liquids .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to linear molecules .",
    "for details the reader is referred to ref .",
    "the starting point is the tensorial one  particle density @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the center of mass position and the euler angles of the n  th molecule at time t. due to the axial symmetry of the molecule the third euler angle @xmath31 does not play a role .",
    "n is the number of molecules and @xmath32 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "the factor in front of the sum is for technical convenience .",
    "the generalization of the density correlator @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) ) to molecular liquids of linear molecules is straightforward : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes complex conjugation and the angular brackets refer to the canonical average over the initial conditions in phase space . generally , the correlation matrix @xmath36 is nondiagonal in both @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the q ",
    "frame , i.e. for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 becomes diagonal in @xmath38 : @xmath42 the matrix elements @xmath43 are real , and nonzero for @xmath44 , only .",
    "in addition they fulfill  @xcite @xmath45 in the third and fourth section we will restrict ourselves to those correlators with @xmath46 and 2 . in that case , only six independent correlators @xmath47 , @xmath48 exist .    a closed set of equations can be derived for the laplace transform @xmath49 of @xmath50by use of the zwanzig ",
    "mori projection formalism in combination with the mode coupling approximation which replaces the slow part of the time dependent memory kernel by a linear combination of bilinear terms @xmath51 .",

    "the kernel @xmath60 can not be calculated exactly .",
    "the mode coupling approximation yields for its slow part ( which determines the long time relaxation ) : @xmath61_{\\mbox{slow } } \\approx m^{\\alpha \\alpha^\\prime}_{\\lambda \\lambda^\\prime}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$},t ) = \\nonumber   \\\\ & & = \\frac{1}{2n } \\sum_{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}_1   \\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}_2 } \\sum_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_1^\\prime \\lambda_2^\\prime } v^{\\alpha \\alpha^\\prime } ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$ } \\lambda \\lambda^\\prime | \\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}_1   \\lambda_1   \\lambda_1^\\prime ; \\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}_2 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_2^\\prime )    \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ : \\times s_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_1^\\prime}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}_1,t )   s_{\\lambda_2 \\lambda_2^\\prime}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}_2,t ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the short hand notation @xmath62 .",
    "the vertices @xmath63 only depend on the static correlators @xmath64 or equivalently on the direct correlations functions @xmath65 . the explicit expression for @xmath66",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "eqs.([eq8])([eq12 ] ) are the closed set of mct",
    " equations for linear molecules , and their structure is quite similar to that of the mct  equations for simple liquids . but due to the presence of odof and their coupling to tdof , which is in the vertex functions @xmath63 , the mode coupling polynomial ( [ eq12 ] ) is much more involved .",
    "therefore , in a first step we will simplify these equations by assuming diagonality of @xmath67 and @xmath68 with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "we stress that this diagonalization approximation is also assumed for the static correlators , in order to keep the coupled set of equations as simple as possible",
    ". since @xmath69 is already diagonal , eqs.([eq8])([eq12 ] ) allow for a self consistent solution for the normalized correlators @xmath70 in the q  frame .",

    "this type of approximation will be called _ weak _ diagonalization approximation ( wda ) . assuming in addition the diagonality of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath23 , and accordingly the diagonality of @xmath86 ( which we call the",

    "bilinear terms @xmath89 , but for @xmath37 odd this can not happen .",
    "therefore @xmath88 with @xmath37 even will exhibit a type ",
    "b transition and those with odd @xmath37 may show a type  a or type  b transition . in case of a type  a transition",
    "the corresponding transition temperature is below that of the type ",

    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 etc . ,",
    "the equation for , e.g. @xmath94 involves @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath95 etc . , but _ not _",
    "@xmath91 , due to the diagonalization approximation of the _ static _ correlators .",
    "therefore the freezing of the center of mass order parameter @xmath90 does not necessarily imply the freezing of @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath94 may freeze at a lower temperature via a type ",
    "b transition . without the diagonalization approximation with respect to the @xmath37 s",
    ", we expect _ all _ @xmath96 to freeze via a type - b transition at a _ single _ critical temperature @xmath9 . for more details on type",
    " a and type  b transitions the reader is referred to the schematic models which are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "in order to test the mct  predictions , a md  simulation for a system of diatomic , rigid molecules  @xcite was performed .",
    "each molecule is composed of two different lennard  jones particles a and b , which are separated by a distance d. both particles have the same mass m. the interaction between two molecules",
    "is given by the sum of the interactions between the four particles which are given by the lennard ",
    "jones potentials @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "the lennard  jones parameters are given by @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we use lengths in units of @xmath102 and @xmath103 is taken as unit for the temperature ( @xmath104 ) . in these units",
    "we have found that @xmath105 is an appropriate value in order to avoid formation of a liquid crystalline phase .",
    "simulation was done for @xmath106 molecules in an ( n , p , t)ensemble with @xmath107 and t between 0.477 and 5.0 by use of the rattle algorithm .",
    "the length of the runs was long enough in order to prepare a well equilibrated system . in order to increase the statistics , average over at least eight independent runs",
    "was performed .",
    "one of the main results we have found is the existence of a type ",
    "b transition with a _",
    "single _ transition temperature @xmath108 , at which the dynamics crosses over from ergodic to quasi ",
    "nonergodic behavior .",
    "this temperature has been deduced from the @xmath23relaxation time of the purely orientational ( i.e. @xmath109 in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] )  @xcite , purely translational ( i.e. @xmath110 in eq.([eq4 ] ) )  @xcite and of the general correlators where @xmath111 and @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath9 can be located within about 2% from these data . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to refs .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ sec2 ] we need for the solution of eqs.([eq15])([eq18 ] ) the static correlators @xmath113 as a function of @xmath114 and temperature t. we remind the reader that we use the q  frame representation , without restricting generality .",
    "the md  result for @xmath0 is shown in figure 1 for @xmath115 and for @xmath116 .",
    "the variation of @xmath117 with temperature is smooth . from this figure",
    "we observe that the q  dependence of @xmath118 strongly depends on @xmath37 and @xmath38 . whereas @xmath119 and @xmath120 resembles the behavior of @xmath8 for a simple liquid , with e.g. a well pronounced main maximum at @xmath121 ,",
    "the q  dependence of the other correlators is qualitatively different .",
    "for instance @xmath122 has its main peak at @xmath123 .    2 as will be seen below , we need @xmath118 for temperatures below @xmath124 , the lowest value of our md  simulation .",
    "this has been achieved by a linear extrapolation from the higher temperature regime ( @xmath125 ) . after smoothing the q  dependence of @xmath118 by a spline under tension ,",
    "equations ( [ eq15])([eq18 ] ) were solved by iteration .",
    "this procedure is standard and had been used for simple liquids ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the iteration was stopped after the maximum value of @xmath126 was less than @xmath127 .",
    "we have used sda and wda ( see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath37dependence has been truncated at @xmath128 and 2 .",
    "the integrations in ( [ eq17 ] ) were performed numerically . for this",
    "the interval @xmath129 $ ] was divided into 300 _ equidistant _ grid points . since the md  data were limited to @xmath130 , we were not able to check the sensitivity of the results for @xmath87 on a variation with @xmath131 .",
    "but there should not be a considerable change by extending @xmath131 to higher values than 25 , because @xmath118 already approaches one for @xmath132 ( for @xmath133 this is not quite true ) ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) .",
    "special attention must be paid to @xmath123 . since @xmath134 for @xmath135 is proportional to @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively , we have treated eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) separately for @xmath123 and @xmath140 .",
    "the results for @xmath87 in between were obtained by a polynomial interpolation of degree four .",
    "the first observation we make is that @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "this result , which holds for sda , wda and @xmath3 , is unexpected , because for all known cases mct overestimates the transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , it is @xmath143 for the binary lennard  jones liquid  @xcite . for @xmath144 ideal glass transitions",
    "are found for our molecular liquid .",
    "the transition temperatures are given in table 1 . here",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "the transition temperatures are determined whitin an accuracy of @xmath145 .",
    "since the critical nep vary as @xmath146 they are correct only within 35 % .",
    "for an accuracy of 1 % and less one must determine @xmath9 more precisely .",
    "this can be achieved by use of the t  dependence of the largest eigenvalue @xmath147 of the stability matrix  @xcite , since @xmath148 for @xmath149 .    from this table",
    "we recognize that the center of mass modes ( @xmath150 ) freeze at @xmath151 independent on @xmath152 and sda or wda .",
    "this transition is of type b. ideal glass transitions for @xmath153 and 2 occur at lower temperatures .",
    "their transition scenario depends on whether @xmath154 or @xmath155 . in case that @xmath156 , i.e. all @xmath157 are neglected , a type  a transition of @xmath158 exists at @xmath159 for wda and at a slightly lower value of 0.187 for sda . but for @xmath160 both modes with @xmath161 and @xmath162",
    "_ simultaneously _ freeze at @xmath163 for wda ( sda ) .",
    "this transition is of type b for @xmath162 _ and _ @xmath161 . whereas @xmath162 _ must _ freeze via a discontinuous ( type  b ) transition",
    ", @xmath161 could undergo a continuous transition ( type  a ) .",
    "the coupling between the modes with @xmath161 and @xmath162 in eq.([eq18 ] ) is obviously large enough to lead to a type ",
    "b transition for @xmath161 , too .",
    "these possible scenarios are in accordance with the discussion at the end of section [ sec2 ] . since for wda the r.h.s . of eq.([eq15])contains more contributions from the coupling between odof and tdof than for sda ,",
    "it is reasonable that the critical temperatures for wda are larger ( or equal ) than those for sda .",
    "the nep @xmath164 obtained from the md ",
    "simulation  @xcite by a fit with the von schweidler law and @xmath165 from molecular mct for @xmath160 , wda and @xmath166 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "whereas @xmath164 for @xmath167 and @xmath168 for @xmath169 are the _ critical _ nep , this is not true for @xmath170 , since @xmath171 . despite the approximations we made ,",
    "the q  dependence of @xmath164 is reasonably well reproduced by the mct  result .",
    "even the shoulder in @xmath172 at @xmath173 is reproduced as a small hump at that q  value .",
    "apart from this prepeak , the q  variation of @xmath88 is in phase with that of the corresponding static correlators ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) . whereas @xmath174 ( as expected again , due to the mean field character of mct ) the opposite is true for @xmath88 with @xmath153 and 2 . for sda",
    "the result for @xmath165 at @xmath175 ( not shown in figure 2 ) is about 5 - 10 % below the corresponding result for wda .",
    ".critical temperatures @xmath176 for @xmath177 and wda .",
    "the corresponding values for sda are given in parantheses .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     2    finally we compare @xmath178 at @xmath179 , i.e. the critical nep , with that at @xmath180 .",
    "the result , including @xmath172 is given in figure 3 .",
    "now , we also find that @xmath181 . that @xmath182 is trivial , because @xmath88 increases monotonously with decreasing temperature .",
    "for the first time , we have compared numerical results for a molecular liquid of diatomic , rigid molecules  @xcite with the corresponding results from _ molecular _ mct for linear molecules , which was worked out recently  @xcite .",
    "this comparison was done for the nonergodicity parameters @xmath87 .",
    "first of all , we find that mct does not yield an ideal glass transition in the temperature range of the simulation .",
    "this is quite similar to what has been found for the md ",
    "simulation of water  @xcite , but is in variance with the behavior for simple lennard ",
    "jones liquids  @xcite and hard spheres  @xcite . for the hard sphere system",
    "this means that the critical density @xmath10 from mct is _ less _ that the experimental value .",
    "this difference between simple and molecular liquids probably reveals the role of odof and their coupling to tdof .",
    "this coupling is underestimated by both diagonalization approximations we used . with these approximations",
    "the ideal glass transition occurs below @xmath183 , only .",
    "the existence of two different transition temperatures for @xmath184 and @xmath185 we believe is an artifact of the diagonalization approximation ( with respect to @xmath37 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the q  dependence of @xmath164 is reasonably well reproduced by the corresponding mct  result . whether the hump in @xmath178 at @xmath173 , which relates to the shoulder of @xmath172 at the same q ",
    "value is genuine can not presently be decided .",
    "but it is interesting that a similar hump in the critical nep has recently been found for the _ molecular _ glass former orthoterphenyl  @xcite . whether its existence in the nonergodicity parameter @xmath186 for the center of mass motion is an indirect influence of the odof or not remains an open question . for otp this prepeak",
    "may be related to an _ intramolecular _ property , not related to odof  @xcite .    to obtain the mct ",
    "results presented in this paper already a considerable numerical effort was necessary .",
    "nevertheless it will be important to solve the mct ",
    "equations without any diagonalization approximation , which we believe guarantees ( for our molecules ) the existence of a _ single _ transition temperature @xmath187 . in this respect",
    "we also would like to mention that , e.g. the _ nondiagonal _ , static correlator @xmath188 is of the same order as @xmath189  @xcite , i.e. it should not be neglected . without assuming diagonality with respect to @xmath37 , more contributions to the translational - rotational coupling",
    "will be taken into account which we expect to yield a higher value for @xmath187 .",
    "if in that case and for @xmath185 it would be still @xmath190 , this would indicate that also correlators with @xmath191 have to be taken into account , as it was done for the single dumb ",
    "bell in an isotropic liquid of hard spheres , however , using sda  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that a one percent accuracy of @xmath192 requires to take into account correlators up to @xmath193 .",
    "but on the other hand our investigation shows that the sda may introduce an error of 510 % .",
    "therefore , in order to get reliable results for the nep , e.g. @xmath194 one has to remove both the diagonalization approximation and the restriction to @xmath195 .",
