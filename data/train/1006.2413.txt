    "in an adaptive optics system , a wavefront sensor measures phase distortions in real - time . these measurements are used to update the shape of a deformable mirror located upstream in the optical beam .",
    "one such wavefront sensor was developed by f.roddier and presented for the first time in 1988 @xcite . in a curvature sensor ( c - s ) , two defocused images are recorded , one on each side of the nominal focal plane .",
    "the wavefront distortion is then inferred from the difference in intensity between the two images . f.roddier and his group at the institute of astronomy , hawaii , implemented a low - order adaptive - optics ( ao ) system based on a curvature wfs with 13 actuators @xcite . in the following years",
    "many other curvature based ao systems were successfully implemented @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    however , as adaptive optic systems evolve towards increasingly large numbers of sensing elements and actuators , curvature sensors tend to be discarded in favor of shack - hartmann ( s - h ) sensors .",
    "this is mainly based on the assertion that the effect of measurement errors on the corrected phase increases steeply with the number of sensing elements in c - s .",
    "this steep , linear increase of the error propagation term was established by n. roddier through simulations@xcite .",
    "the author further reported on concurring analytic calculations by j.b .",
    "shellan for more than 10 000 actuators .",
    "these calculations are however not publicly available .",
    "high - order curvature systems have been simulated by e.g. o.lai et al.@xcite and q.yang et al.@xcite .",
    "both authors conclude in general favor of high - order c - s systems .",
    "yang et al .",
    "conclude : `` no degradation of the phase transfer function with increasing actuator number is observed , implying that still higher actuator number systems are possible with no significant modification of the basic concept and design '' .",
    "we feel that , in addition to these results , it is necessary to analyze the effect of measurement noise on the performance of curvature systems , and in particular on the performance of high - order systems .",
    "sec.[sec:2 ] of this article considers the special role of the sensing elements that lie on the pupil edge .",
    "the minimum number of such edge elements is derived in dependence on the total number of sensing elements .",
    "this result is then used in section[sec:4 ] where c - s with up to 225 elements are simulated .",
    "sec.[sec:3 ] analyzes the measurement noise in curvature sensors : the quantity measured by curvature sensors is @xmath0 , where the photon numbers @xmath1 follow a poisson distribution .",
    "can the distribution of @xmath2 be approximated by a gaussian and is the 68%-confidence interval well approximated by @xmath3 ?",
    "sec.[sec:3 ] further derives the number of photons needed to obtain meaningful measurements of @xmath2 .",
    "sec.[sec:4 ] studies the effect of measurement noise on the phase reconstruction .",
    "we agree with n. roddier s result , that were obtained for a fixed size of the sensing elements and a fixed defocus length .",
    "however , for a constant pupil surface  hence a decreasing sensing - element size  and with an adjusted extrafocal distance , the error propagation factor is found to be almost independent of the number of sensing elements .",
    "sec.[sec:4 ] concludes with a closed expression for the error propagation factor and an estimate of the strehl decrease due to photon noise .",

    "eq.[eq : roddier ] further assumes the size of the diffraction patterns to be negligible compared to the characteristic scales of intensity fluctuations in the detector plane .",
    "this sets a condition on the extra focal distance : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fried parameter . in regions",
    "where the pupil transmission is uniform , the measured signal is the laplacian of the wavefront phase . on the pupil edge",
    " i.a . along the central obstruction and along the telescope spiders  curvature sensors measure curvature and radial tilt .",
    "phase aberrations with a laplacian equal to zero are sensed solely at the pupil edges .",
    "the phase of the distorted wavefront is expressed in terms of a series of zernike polynomials : @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 are integers and @xmath21 is even .",
    "@xmath22 is the coefficient of the zernike polynomial @xmath23 . in",
    "atmospherically distorted wavefronts , the lowest order zernike modes have the highest variance and need to be corrected by the ao system first .",
    "the first order zernike mode , piston , is an exception : it corresponds to a constant phase change over the whole pupil and does not affect the image quality .",
    "table [ tab : laplacians ] lists the laplacian of the fifteen lowest zernike polynomials .",
    "eight out of fourteen polynomials ( piston excluded ) have zero laplacian , and their contribution to the distorted wavefront is therefore only measured at the pupil edges . in an ideal ao system @xmath24 ` sensor - actuator ' pairs ( i.e. @xmath24 sub - apertures ) are required to sense and correct @xmath25 modes of the wavefront phase .",
    "it is assumed that the lowest zernike modes are corrected first ( piston excluded ) .",
    "@xmath25 is the number of corrected modes and @xmath19 the radial index of the highest , corrected mode . since there are @xmath26 zernike polynomials for each radial index @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath19 are related by the following inequality : @xmath28    [ tab : laplacians ]    the zernike modes for which the absolute value of the meridional index , @xmath20 , equals the radial index , @xmath19 , have zero laplacian .",
    "there are , consequently , two zero - laplacian polynomials per radial index , hence in order to correct the first @xmath25 zernike polynomials , a curvature sensor needs at least @xmath29 sensors at the aperture edge , where @xmath19 is determined by eq.[eq : radial ] : @xmath30 @xmath31 is the floor function .",
    "figure[fig : edge ] traces the minimum number of edge sensors in dependence on the number of modes to be corrected . instead of increasing the number of edge sensors ,",
    "it is also possible to smoothen the pupil edges .",

    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath34 is taken to be solely due to photon noise .",
    "this is a valid approximation if the sky background signal is low and if the detector readout noise and dark current are negligible .",
    "existing curvature sensors use avalanche photo - diodes where the readout noise and dark current are indeed negligible .",
    "the variable @xmath0 serves as estimate of the deviation @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are independent poisson distributed random variables with mean value @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to judge the precision of the estimate the parameters of the distribution of @xmath2 need to be known , i.e. the mean , the variance , the skewness and the kurtosis",
    ". these are closely related to the moments or , more specifically , the cumulants , @xmath36 , of the distribution . in closed - loop ao observations",
    ", @xmath37 tends towards 0 .",
    "furthermore the photon numbers , @xmath38 , are usually large .",
    "the parameters of the distribution of @xmath2 are then , as will be seen , simple : the mean and the skewness are zero and both the variance and the excess kurtosis are @xmath39 .",
    "it is nevertheless of interest to derive the exact solution for the more general case where @xmath37 is not zero , and @xmath40 is not very large .",
    "it is convenient to deal first with the variable @xmath41 , rather than @xmath42 .",
    "the cumulants , @xmath36 of @xmath2 are subsequently expressed in terms of the cumulants , @xmath43 , of @xmath41 : @xmath44 the joint distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath45 equals the product of the poisson probability , @xmath46 , for the variable @xmath45 with mean value @xmath40 , and the binomial probability , @xmath47 , that out of the z events @xmath4 are of the type that occurs with relative probability @xmath48 : @xmath49 the outcome @xmath50 is excluded since @xmath2 is then undefined .",
    "the probabilities @xmath46 are thus normalized to the positive integers @xmath45 , i.e. are increased by the factor @xmath51 relative to the familiar poisson probabilities .",
    "the @xmath52-th moment , @xmath53 can be written in the form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the moments about zero of the binomial distribution with mean value @xmath45 and parameter @xmath27 . using the familiar equations for these moments one obtains the expressions :",
    "@xmath56 the moments @xmath53 of the variable @xmath41 are obtained by summation over @xmath45 according to eq.[eq : mom ] .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to the determination of the poisson mean values @xmath57 .",
    "since there are no closed expressions , one needs to evaluate those mean values numerically , which is conveniently done in term of the ratios : @xmath58 the @xmath59 converge to unity at large @xmath40 .",
    "the cumulants of the distribution of @xmath41 stand in a general relation to the moments : @xmath60 using eqs.[eq : m1]-[eq : rho ] and switching in terms of eqs.[eq : cum1]-[eq : cum4 ] to the cumulants of @xmath2 one obtains : @xmath61 instead of the parameter @xmath48 , i.e. the mean value of @xmath41 , one wishes to use the parameter @xmath35 : @xmath62 the commonly used parameters of the distribution of @xmath2 , i.e. the mean value @xmath63 , the variance , @xmath64 , the skewness , sk@xmath65 and the ( excess ) kurtosis , kur@xmath66 are , therefore : @xmath67 for large @xmath40 , @xmath68 tends to unity , and , as can be shown , @xmath69 converges to @xmath39 .",
    "the formulae then reduce to : @xmath70 as stated in the outset , the parameters become very simple for small @xmath37 , i.e. for nearly equal light intensities in the two images , and if @xmath40 is large .",
    "the mean and skewness of @xmath2 are then zero and the variance and the ( excess ) kurtosis are @xmath39 .",
    "fig.[fig : a1 ] gives the standard deviation and the excess kurtosis of the measured @xmath2 for the case of equal light intensity of the two ao images , i.e. for @xmath71 .",
    "it shows that the kurtosis is close to zero even for fairly low photon numbers , @xmath40 .",
    "the approximation in terms of the gaussian distribution is , thus , justified and the standard error range in terms of the 68%-confidence range for a measured value @xmath2 can be set equal to @xmath72 while the 95%-confidence range is @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 still has the substantial value 0.1 for @xmath75 , one requires much higher photon numbers to obtain meaningful measurements at small values of @xmath37 . even at the large photon number @xmath76 the standard error of @xmath2 is 0.01 ,",
    "i.e. one needs a measured value @xmath77 to reject the null - hypothesis of equal light intensity in the two images ( @xmath71 ) on the 95%-confidence level .",
