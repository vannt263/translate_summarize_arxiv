    "in this paper , we explore a class of abstractions for non - linear autonomous systems ( continuous , discrete and hybrid systems ) using _ change - of - bases _ ( cob ) transformations .",
    "cob transformations are obtained for a given system by expressing the dynamics of the system in terms of a new set of variables that relate to the original system variables through the cob transformation .",
    "such a transformation is akin to studying the system under a new set of `` bases '' .",
    "we derive conditions on the transformations such that ( a ) the cob transformations also define an _ autonomous system _ and ( b ) the resulting system abstracts the original system : i.e. , all invariants of the abstract system can be transformed into invariants for the original system .",
    "furthermore , we often seek abstract systems through cob transformations whose dynamics are of a simpler form , more amenable to automatic verification techniques .",
    "for instance , it is possible to use cob transformations that relate an ode with non - linear right - hand sides to an affine ode , or transformations that reduce the degree of a system with polynomial right - hand sides .",
    "if such transformations can be found , then safety analysis techniques over the simpler abstract system can be used to infer safety properties of the original system .    in this paper , we make two main contributions : ( a ) we define cob transformations for continuous , discrete and hybrid systems and provide conditions under which a given transformation is valid ; ( b ) we provide search techniques for finding cob transformations that result in a polynomial system whose right - hand sides are degree limited by some limit @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , the case @xmath1 yields an affine abstraction ; and ( c ) we provide experimental evidence of the application of our techniques to a variety of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and discrete programs .    the results in this paper",
    "extend our previously published results that appeared in hscc 2011  @xcite .",
    "the contributions of this paper include ( a ) an extension from linearizing cob transformations to degree - bounded polynomial cob transformations , ( b ) extending the theory from purely continuous system to discrete and hybrid systems , and ( c ) an improved implementation that can handle hybrid systems with some evaluation results using this implementation .",
    "on the other hand , our previous work also included an extension of the theory to differential inequalities and iterative techniques over cones .",
    "these extensions are omitted here in favor of an extended treatment of the theory of differential equation abstractions for continuous , discrete and hybrid systems .      in this section ,",
    "we motivate the techniques developed in this paper by means of a few illustrative examples involving purely continuous odes and purely discrete programs .",
    "our first example concerns a continuous system defined by a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) :    [ ex : motivating - example ] consider a continuous system over @xmath2 : @xmath3 , with initial conditions given by the set @xmath4,\\ y \\in [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "using the transformation @xmath5 wherein @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we find that the dynamics over @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10    its initial conditions are given by @xmath11,\\ w_2 \\in [ 0,1],\\ w_3 \\in [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "we analyze the system using the timepass tool as presented in our previous work  @xcite to obtain polyhedral invariants : @xmath12 substituting back , we can infer polynomial inequality invariants on the original system including , @xmath13    finally , we integrate the linear system to infer the following conserved quantity for the underlying non - linear system : @xmath14    finally , if @xmath15 , the map @xmath16 is invertible and therefore , the ode above can be integrated .",
    "note that not every transformation yields a linear abstraction .",
    "in fact , most transformations will not define an abstraction .",
    "the conditions for an abstraction are discussed in section  [ section : covabstraction ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "thus far , we have presented an approach that uses change - of - bases transformation for inferring abstractions of continuous , discrete and hybrid systems .",
    "we have explored the theoretical underpinnings of our approach , its connections to various invariant generation techniques presented earlier .",
    "our previous work presents an extension of the approach presented in this paper to infer differential inequality abstractions  @xcite .",
    "similar extensions for discrete systems remain unexplored .",
    "furthermore , the use of the abstractions presented here to establish termination for transition systems is also a promising line of future research .",
    "future research will also focus on the use of lie symmetries to reduce the size of the ansatz or templates used in the search for conserved quantities and cob transformations  @xcite .",
