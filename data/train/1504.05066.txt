    "the interaction of a neutral atom with a material surface is a problem profusely addressed in the literature @xcite . in most of the approaches",
    "the atom is taken in a stationary state w.r.t .",
    "the time of observation . at zero temperature and in the electric dipole approximation , the atom undergoes a series of virtual e1 transitions to upper levels .",
    "it is the coupling of the charges of the atom and the currents on the surface to the quantum em field that induces the correlation between their transtient dipole moments , giving rise to a non - vanishing interaction .",
    "the lifetime of the virtual atomic transitions is very short in comparison to ordinary observation times and thus , the use of stationary quantum perturbation theory is well justified for the calculation of this interaction @xcite . for distances greater than the relevant atomic transition wavelengths",
    "this interaction is referred to as _ retarded casimir - polder ( cp ) interaction _ , while for distances much shorter than those wavelengths it is referred to as _ van der waals _ or _ non - retarded cp interaction_.    when atoms close to dielectric surfaces are driven under the action of external sources , virtual and actual transitions mix up with each other in the time evolution of the atomic wave function . from a practical perspective , the effect of the cp interaction on the dynamics of driven atoms is of great importance in hybrid quantum systems eg . ref.@xcite . at first sight , under quasi - stationary conditions",
    ", that effect reduces to an additive level shift on the atomic eigenstates , which is just a generalized lamb - shift @xcite . in the closely related case of the interaction between two driven rydberg atoms ,",
    "this phenomenon originates the van der waals blockade of the rabi oscillations .",
    "this is the idea behind neutral atoms quantum gates @xcite , where the excitation of the target atom is blocked as the energy shift of its rydberg level exceeds the value of the bare rabi frequency .",
    "however , recent findings suggests that other dynamical effects might be relevant under certain conditions cf .",
    "refs.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , state of the art techniques on atomic interferometry have proved useful in measuring accurately the dynamical phase shifts accumulated by the wave function of coherently driven atoms @xcite .",
    "those phase shifts contain information about the interaction of the atoms with the environment .",
    "this is at the root of the proposals of refs.@xcite to measure the interaction of an alkali atom with a macroscopic surface at submicron distances . at this distance ,",
    "the dominant interactions are expected to be the cp interaction and the gravitational interaction . in the experimental setup of ref.@xcite",
    "the atoms are trapped in a 1d vertical lattice , which allows for an accurate control over the relative position of the atoms w.r.t . to the surface .",
    "the uniform earth gravitational field creates a ladder of localized states referred to as wannier - stack states . at first glance",
    ", the net effect of the casimir interaction reduces to additive shifts on the atomic energy levels , both external ( i.e. , those involving the center of mass d.o.f . ) and internal ( i.e. , those involving the electronic energy levels ) @xcite . as for the case of the van der waals blockade ,",
    "this approximation assumes implicitly that the casimir energy can be integrated out _ a priori _ in the energy levels , before the atom is driven .",
    "however , dynamical effects may deviate from this assumption .",
    "let us take as an example an atom driven through a lambda configuration [ see fig.[rabir](@xmath0 ) ] in the presence of a material surface .",
    "on the one hand , the atom is pumped by two raman lasers from two low - lying states , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , to common excited intermediate states , @xmath3 .",
    "it is the combined action of both lasers that gives rise to the effective coherent oscillation of the atom between the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand , the cp interaction of the atom with the surface results in similar excitation / desexcitation transitions which are mediated by virtual photons rather than laser beams see fig.[fig0](@xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that both processes interfere with each other affecting the overall dynamics of the atom .",
    "it is our purpose to investigate the conditions under which the interplay between the raman interaction and the cp interaction provides appreciable consequences on the coherent dynamics of an atom .",
    "we will show that , in the perturbative regime , the net effect is an effective shift of the rabi frequency . in this article we concentrate on scenarios similar to those of refs.@xcite , where atoms are driven through a combination of raman lasers and microwaves at the time they interact with a macroscopic surface .",
    "our approach is based on the time evolution of the atomic wave function .",
    "as long as the surface resonant frequency is far from the atomic resonances , the classical treatment of the em response of the surface is expected to be a good approximation .",
    "the case of the interaction between two driven rydberg atoms is left for a separate publication .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
