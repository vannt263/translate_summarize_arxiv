    "the presence of nanoscale inhomogeneities is ubiquitous in the cuprate superconductors@xcite , the magnetoresistive manganites@xcite and other doped transition metal oxides@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is emerging consensus that doped charge carriers in the oxides may phase segregate to form nano - scale textures .",
    "these are believed to be of importance for achieving their functional properties such is superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite and giant magnetoresistance in the manganites@xcite .    for the cuprates",
    "the idea of charge segregation appeared soon after the discovery of superconductivity @xcite . in a doped semiconductor",
    "the phase separation may have two different origins .",
    "the first is the chemical origin and is associated with the segregation of dopant atoms .",
    "this type of phase segregation is usually temperature independent and weakly dependent on external perturbation .",
    "exceptions may appear due to a large mobility of dopant atoms at relatively high temperature .",
    "if the mobility of impurity atoms is small one might expect a pure electronic mechanism of phase separation . in this case",
    "the electronic system is in thermodynamic equilibrium and competing phases are close in energy .",
    "this is typical for the systems exhibiting a first order phase transition .",
    "electronic phase separation is very often observed in the magnetic semiconductors like @xmath0 or @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore the idea of the charge segregation in the cuprate superconductors and in the manganites is very often associated with magnetic degrees of freedom @xcite , where the phase separation is discussed within @xmath2 model . in refs .",
    "@xcite phase separation was studied within hubbard model .",
    "the results are still controversial . in some cases",
    "the @xmath2 model displays clear static @xcite or dynamic@xcite phase separation .",
    "the situation is quite different for the hubbard model .",
    "for example the results of numerical simulations@xcite suggest that the phase separation is absent at any set of parameters and for any size of the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , all these models do not consider _ long - range _ coulomb repulsion which has very strong effect on the phase separation .",
    "@xcite    the long - range coulomb repulsion together with the surface energy determine the topology of the two phase state .",
    "the charged carriers have the tendency towards spatial segregation which is caused by the fact that the free energy density of the phase with finite density of carriers is lower then the free energy density of the undoped system . on the other hand",
    ", the charge segregation leads to the charging effect because the dopant atoms are distributed uniformly in the system .",
    "therefore , a strong electric field appears which has tendency to mix the charged phases . in the low doping limit",
    "there is a low concentration of charged droplets and they do not overlap .",
    "the system behaves as an insulator .",
    "when the concentration increases the percolative transition to a new phase is expected@xcite .",
    "more recently it was suggested that an interplay of a short range lattice attraction and the long - range coulomb repulsion could lead to the formation of short metallic or insulating strings of polarons@xcite .",
    "this was mainly motivated by observation of giant isotope effect in manganites and cuprates@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we suggested that an anisotropic mesoscopic jahn - teller interaction between electrons and @xmath3 optical phonons might lead to the formation of carrier pairs and stripes .",
    "a slightly different approach , based on elasticity was considered more recently for the case of the manganites by kugel and khomskii @xcite using the methods of eremin et al.@xcite , and by shenoy et al.@xcite .",
    "the fundamental question which we try and answer here is how charged particles order in the presence of anisotropic jahn - teller type interaction , particularly when their density becomes large .",
    "we consider charged particles on a 2d square lattice subject to _ only _ the long - range coulomb interaction and an anisotropic jahn - teller ( jt ) deformation . in the preliminary report",
    "we have considered a narrow doping range , but have found a clear evidence of phase segregation and preferential formation of pairs.@xcite here we extend this study over the full doping range .    in the mean field ( mf )",
    "approximation without coulomb repulsion , the system displays a first order phase transition to an ordered state below some critical temperature . in the presence of coulomb repulsion global phase separation becomes unfavorable and the system shows a mesoscopic phase separation , where the size of charged regions is determined by the competition between the ordering energy and the coulomb energy . using monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations",
    "we show that the system can form many different mesoscopic textures , such as clusters and stripes , depending only on the magnitude of the coulomb repulsion compared to the anisotropic lattice attraction and the density of charged particles .",
    "surprisingly , in agreement with previous report a feature arising from the anisotropy introduced by the jahn - teller interaction is that in a wide part of the phase diagram objects with even number of particles are found to be more stable than with odd number particles , which could be significant for superconductivity when tunnelling is included@xcite .",
    "the model proposed in the ref.@xcite involves all interactions allowed by the symmetry .",
    "we consider a simplified version of the model , where only the interaction leading to the deformation of the @xmath4 symmetry is taken into account . the interaction with @xmath5 mode leads to similar effects and",
    "therefore for our purposes we can restrict ourselves by consideration @xmath4 mode only . as a result",
    "the interacting part of the hamiltonian has the form : @xmath6 here the pauli matrix @xmath7 describes two components of the electronic doublet , and @xmath8 is a symmetric function describing the range of the interaction .",
    "we omit the spin index in the sum , since we ignore spin structure at present .",
    "the resulting model could be easily reduced to a lattice gas model .",
    "this is performed using the lang - firsov transformation or equivalently the adiabatic approximation for the phonon field .",
    "let us introduce the classical variable @xmath9 and minimize the energy as a function of @xmath10 in presence of the harmonic term @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain the deformation , which corresponds to the minimum energy , @xmath12 where @xmath13 . substituting @xmath14 to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and taking into account",
    "that the carriers are charged we arrive to the lattice gas model . to formulate the model",
    "we use a pseudospin operator @xmath15 with @xmath16 to describe the occupancies of the two electronic levels @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 corresponds to the state with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 to @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "simultaneous occupancy of both levels is excluded due to the high onsite coulomb repulsion ( cr ) energy .",
    "the hamiltonian in terms of the pseudospin operator is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the coulomb potential , @xmath30 is the charge of electron , @xmath31 is the static dielectric constant and @xmath32 is the effective unit cell period .",
    "the anisotropic short range attraction potential is given by @xmath33    the attraction in this model is generated by the interaction of electrons with optical phonons .",
    "the radius of the attraction force is determined by the radius of the electron - phonon interaction and the dispersion of the optical phonons@xcite .",
    "a similar model can be formulated in the limit of the continuous media . in this case",
    "the deformation is characterized by components of the strain tensor .",
    "for the two dimensional case we can define 3 components of the strain tensor : @xmath34 transforming as the @xmath35 representation of the @xmath36 group , @xmath37 transforming as the @xmath4 representation and @xmath38 transforming as the @xmath39 representation .",
    "these components of the tensor are coupled linearly with the two - fold degenerate electronic state which transforms as the @xmath40 or @xmath41 representation of the point group .",
    "similarly to the case of interaction with optical phonons we will keep the interaction with deformation of the @xmath4 symmetry , namely @xmath42 only .",
    "the hamiltonian without the coulomb term has the form : @xmath43 here @xmath44 are corresponding components of the elastic modulus tensor , and @xmath45 is coupling constant of the charge carriers with the strain tensor .",
    "the components of the strain tensor are not independent @xcite and obey the compatibility condition : @xmath46 the compatibility condition leads to the long range anisotropic interaction between polarons . to derive the hamiltonian we minimize eq.(5 ) with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 taking into account compatibility condition .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian in the reciprocal space has the form : @xmath49 the wavevector dependence of the potential is given by @xmath50 by minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath51 and including the long - range cr we again obtain eq.(3 ) .",
    "the anisotropic interaction potential @xmath52 is determined in this case by the interaction with the classical deformation and is long - range as well .",
    "it decays as @xmath53 at large distances . since attraction forces decay faster then the coulomb repulsion at large distances the attraction can overcome the coulomb repulsion at short distances leading to the mesoscopic phase separation .",
    "irrespective of whether the resulting interaction between polarons is generated by acoustic or optical phonons the main physical picture remains the same . in both cases",
    "there is an anisotropic attraction between polarons over short distances .",
    "this interaction can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic in terms of the pseudospin operators depending on the spatial direction . without loosing generality",
    "we assume that @xmath54 is nonzero only for the nearest neighbors and can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "our main goal is to study this lattice gas model ( 3 ) at a constant average density , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total number of sites .",
    "however , to clarify the physical picture we first perform calculations in absence of long - range cr at a fixed chemical potential first by adding the term @xmath57 to the hamiltonian ( [ eq_hjt ] ) .",
    "similar models were studied many years ago on the basis of the molecular - field approximation in the bragg - williams formalism @xcite .",
    "the mean - field equations for the two variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 have the form@xcite : @xmath60 @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the number of the nearest neighbours for the square lattice in 2d and @xmath63  is the boltzman constant . for positive @xmath64 equation ( [ eq_m ] ) has 2 solutions bellow @xmath65 .",
    "the solution with @xmath66 is unstable while the solution with a finite @xmath67 corresponds to the global minimum with @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",

    "the free energy has two minima and one maximum .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath72 is of first order .",
    "the trivial solution @xmath66 corresponds to the case when @xmath73 as @xmath69 . for @xmath74",
    "there is only the trivial solution of the equation @xmath66 .",
    "when the number of particles is fixed ( eq.([eq_npart ] ) ) the system is unstable with respect to global phase separation below @xmath75 .",
    "the line of the phase transition is determined by the condition : @xmath76 where @xmath77is the free energy , @xmath78is the critical chemical potential and @xmath67 is the solution of eq . ( [ eq_m ] ) . as a result , at a fixed average @xmath58 two phases with @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "coexist as determined by eqations([eq_m],[eq_nvsm ] ) .",
    "the region of phase coexistence is shown in fig.1 .",
    "for comparison with the mf solutions we performed monte - carlo simulations of the model eq.(3 ) in absence of the coulomb forces . due to strong fluctuations in 2d",
    "the critical temperature determined from mc simulations is reduced by factor of @xmath81 in comparison to the mf result .",
    "let us now consider the role of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the area under the @xmath82 in fig.1 is the area of phase coexistence .",
    "if we fix the temperature the two phases with the bulk concentrations @xmath83 and @xmath84 will have volume fractions @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively , where @xmath87 . since the system is globally electroneutral , the phases with @xmath83 and @xmath84 are charged .",
    "however , to break electroneutrality requires a large increase of the coulomb energy . as a consequence growth of charged regions with two different charge densities",
    "is blocked by the coulomb forces .    in the literature",
    "there are a few examples of introduction of charging effects in the problem of phase separation @xcite .",
    "there are several different possibilities to include long - range coulomb forces in the model .",
    "muratov@xcite proposed that the order parameter is a charged scalar and the charge density is proportional to the order parameter .",

    "we introduce the layer thickness d. we believe that this condition is favorable for creating charge segregation because electrostatic field is not screened in the third direction . solving this equation by applying the fourrier transform and substituting the solution back into the free energy density we obtain : @xmath108 as a result the free energy functional is similar to the case of first order phase transition with a shifted critical temperature due to presence of the term @xmath109 and with additional nonlocal gradient term .    to demonstrate that the uniform solution has a higher free energy then a nonhomogeneous solution we make the fourier transformation of the gradient term : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are fourier components of the order parameter and square of the order parameter respectively .",

    "this type of coupling is more general in comparison with the models where the charge plays the role of an external field .    using monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations we showed that below a characteristic clustering temperature the system forms many different mesoscopic textures , such as clusters and stripes , depending only on the magnitude of the coulomb repulsion compared to the anisotropic lattice attraction and the density of charged particles . below the clustering temperature",
    "the system goes through a series of crossovers between phases with different mesoscopic textures when the particle density is increased .",
    "the low temperature part of the phase diagram is rather symmetric with respect to half filling .",
    "however , above half doping another high temperature scale appears corresponding to orbital ordering of the particles .",
    "surprisingly , a feature arising from the anisotropy introduced by the jahn - teller interaction is that objects with an even number of particles more stable than those with an odd number of particles .",
