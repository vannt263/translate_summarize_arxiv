    "in this paper we consider the heating of the solar corona in regions where the large - scale magnetic field deviates significantly from a ( current - free ) potential field .",
    "evidence for such nonpotential structures comes from a variety of sources .",
    "measurements of photospheric vector fields in active regions often show deviations from the potential field .",
    "x - ray observations show _ sigmoids _ , which are bright s - shaped or inverse s - shaped structures inside or between active regions .",
    "these sigmoids contain coronal loops that are highly sheared with respect to the photospheric polarity inversion line ( pil ) , and are are often associated with h@xmath0 filaments .",
    "@xcite proposed a differential magnetic shear model in which the degree of shear decreases with height in the observed active region .",
    "@xcite studied the nonpotentiality of active regions using extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) images from the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( trace ) .",
    "they found that significant nonpotentiality occurs when new magnetic flux has recently emerged into the corona , or when rapidly evolving , opposite polarity flux concentrations are in close contact .",
    "@xcite tested various models of coronal heating using potential , linear force - free , and magnetostatic models .",
    "of course , nonpotential magnetic fields also play an important role in solar flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "the nonpotential structures in the corona have been modeled as _ flux ropes _ in which the field lines twist about an axial field line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the presence of a coronal flux rope implies the existence of electric currents that pass through the photosphere and into the corona .",
    "the corona of an active region is a magnetically dominated plasma .",
    "therefore , except during a flare or eruption , the corona is nearly force free , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the magnetic field and @xmath3 is the so - called torsion parameter . a magnetic field with this property is called a nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) .",
    "many authors have developed nlfff models of active regions , either by extrapolating photospheric vector fields into the corona , or using a flux rope insertion method .",
    "active regions exhibit transient brightenings at euv and soft x - ray wavelengths on time scales of a few minutes .",
    "these single- or multi - loop brightenings are thought to be due to the release of magnetic energy by small reconnection events in the complex coronal field of an active region .",
    "this may be a two - step process : magnetic energy may first be converted into kinetic energy of reconnection outflows , waves or energetic particles , and then be converted into thermal energy of the plasma @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that x - ray sigmoids are also heated by such reconnection events , with many events occuring simultaneously at different sites within the sigmoid .",
    "the events may occur so frequently that the coronal plasma does not have time to cool significantly between heating events , keeping the plasma at temperatures of 3 - 5 mk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would explain why sigmoids generally do not show up in euv spectral lines formed at 1 - 1.5 mk .",
    "what is the origin of the energy released in small reconnection events ?",
    "one possibility is that the energy is injected into the corona by small - scale random footpoint motions , which lead to twisting and braiding of coronal field lines .",
    "however , in the highly sheared magnetic field of a sigmoid there is another possibility , namely , that the energy for coronal heating is derived from the energy of the flux rope itself . in this case",
    "the energy is already stored in the corona and does not need to be injected at the photospheric footpoints .",
    "generally , a large amount of free energy is available in the coronal flux rope ( @xmath4 erg ) , sufficient to explain both the heating of the coronal plasma and the occurrence of flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "the second scenario leads us to propose a new theory for the heating of coronal flux ropes .",
    "the basic ideas are illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the lower part of the figure shows a flux rope in the low corona . inside the flux rope",
    "is a magnetic field that runs more or less parallel to the flux rope axis .",
    "the flux rope is held down by an overlying coronal arcade ( not shown ) , which has a magnetic field that runs perpendicular to the flux rope axis .",
    "hence , going from the inside to the outside of the flux rope the direction of the mean magnetic field rotates through an angle of about 90 degrees .",
    "the upper part of the figure shows the fine - scale structure of the magnetic field at the boundary between the flux rope and its surroundings .",
    "the magnetic field has both mean and fluctuating components , as indicated by the wiggles in the field lines .",
    "the total magnetic field @xmath2 is assumed to be stochastic in nature @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fluctuations are assumed to be produced by some unspecified mhd process that ultimately derives its energy from the free magnetic energy of the coronal flux rope .",
    "@xcite proposed that turbulent fluctuations could be produced by tearing modes in coronal current sheets , but the present paper does not depend on that particular mechanism .",
    "we only assume that reconnection occurs intermittently at many sites in the stochastic field .",
    "the reconnection events produce outflows and energetic particles that ultimately result in heating of the coronal plasma .",
    "the above process is an example of a `` dynamo '' process because it involves turbulent diffusion of the mean magnetic field of the coronal flux rope .",
    "dynamo activity , defined as the amplification and/or maintenance of large - scale magnetic fields , occurs in many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas , and magnetic helicity evolution plays an important role in such activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered turbulence in low-@xmath5 plasmas , and proposed that the evolution of the mean magnetic field can be described in term of _ hyperdiffusion _ , a type of magnetic diffusion in which the magnetic helicity of the mean field is conserved .",
    "@xcite proposed that tearing modes can produce turbulence in three - dimensional sheared magnetic fields , and showed that such turbulence causes hyperdiffusion , which may explain both fast reconnection in solar flares and the heating of the solar corona . @xcite",
    "considered the constraints on the dynamo mechanism from helicity conservation and the back - reaction of the magnetic field on plasma dynamics .",
    "they showed that the results of kinematic dynamo theory are strongly modified by the production of hyperdiffusion in the mean field equation .",
    "hyperdiffusion has also been included in models for decaying active regions .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the plasma heating associated with hyperdiffusion . at present , it is unclear to what extent stochastic effects dominate the solar magnetic field .",
    "our purpose here is not to develop a complete theory of such fields , but rather to determine some of the observable consequences of their existence .",
    "therefore , more detailed questions , such as how the stochastic field is produced and the nature of the mhd instabilities , will remain unanswered . the main goal is to demonstrate that the existence of stochastic fields is consistent with existing observations of coronal heating in active regions .",
    "the theory of hyperdiffusion was first proposed by @xcite and @xcite , and further developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others . in this section",
    "we summarize the results of these analyses as they apply to the solar corona , i.e. , when the plasma is magnetically dominated .",
    "the total magnetic field @xmath6 is a sum of mean and fluctuating components , and is described in terms of the vector potential @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution equation for the vector potential is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electric field , @xmath11 is the scalar potential , and @xmath12 is the speed of light . inserting ohm s law and ampere s law , we obtain @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the plasma velocity , and @xmath15 is the ohmic diffusivity .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the system size and @xmath18 is the time scale for the evolution of the mean magnetic field .",
    "then reconnection occurs only in highly localized regions ( e.g. , current sheets ) that make up only a small fraction of the volume .",
    "following @xcite , we use the coulomb gauge , @xmath19 , so that the scalar potential is given by @xmath20 the magnetic helicity equation follows from equation ( [ eq : dadt ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the helicity density , and @xmath23 is the helicity flux : @xmath24 @xcite has shown that in the limit @xmath16 the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : heli ] ) can be neglected , so this equation describes the conservation of magnetic helicity . the relative magnetic helicity is defined by @xmath25 ~ dv$ ] , where subscript @xmath26 refers to the potential field , and the integration includes the coronal and subsurface regions .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath16 , if no helicity is injected into the corona at the photosphere or ejected into the heliosphere , @xmath27 is constant in time .",
    "let @xmath28 be the mean magnetic field smoothed over some intermediate spatial scale @xmath29 , and let @xmath30 be the fluctuating field on scales less than @xmath29 .",
    "similar decompositions are made for other physical quantities . applying the smoothing operator to equations ( [ eq : e ] ) and ( [ eq : dadt ] ) ,",

    "here we neglected the ohmic diffusion of the mean field .",
    "the helicity equation for the mean magnetic field can be derived from equation ( [ eq : dadt0 ] ) : @xmath37 =   2 { \\cal e}_0 \\cdot { \\bf b}_0 .",

    "subtracting equation ( [ eq : heli1 ] ) from equation ( [ eq : heli2 ] ) yields the following relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath40 : @xmath44 the electromotive force can be written as a sum of components parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field , @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "the parallel component is given by equation ( [ eq:2eb ] ) , and the perpendicular component can be written in terms of a transport velocity @xmath47 , which is defined by @xmath48 . then the electromotive force is given by @xmath49    we assume that the magnetic field evolves slowly in response to hyperdiffusion and changes in the boundary conditions . furthermore , we assume that the magnetic pressure is much larger than the plasma pressure , so that the mean magnetic field evolves through a series of force - free equilibrium states , @xmath50 .",
    "the force - free condition can also be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the torsion parameter of the mean field . for a linear force free field ( @xmath52 = constant )",
    "the helicity flux @xmath40 should vanish because there is no magnetic free energy available to drive the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "therefore , following @xcite and @xcite we assume that @xmath40 is proportional to the gradient of @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the so - called hyperdiffusivity . inserting expression ( [ eq : hyper ] ) into equations ( [ eq : e0 ] ) and ( [ eq : dadt0 ] ) yields the following diffusion equation for the mean magnetic field : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total transport velocity .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : dadt1 ] ) describes the effect of the magnetic fluctuations in diffusing the mean magnetic field .",
    "the effect is such that the magnetic helicity of the system is conserved .",
    "hyperdiffusion describes the tendency of the magnetic field to relax to a state of constant @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the heating of the coronal plasma resulting from taylor relaxation was first modeled by @xcite .",
    "the energy equation for the mean magnetic field can be derived from equations ( [ eq : dadt0 ] ) , ( [ eq : e0 ] ) and ( [ eq : fff0 ] ) : @xmath57 and inserting equation ( [ eq : hyper ] ) we can write @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total transport velocity .",
    "the quantity on the rhs of equation ( [ eq : ener2 ] ) is negative and can be interpreted as the rate at which mean magnetic energy is converted into heat @xcite .",
    "assuming there is no inflow of energy at the boundaries , the total magnetic energy decreases monotonically with time : @xmath60",
    "the above theory predicts a particular form of the mean - field diffusion equation , but does not explain why the helicity flux @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath61 , nor does it predict the value of the hyperdiffusivity @xmath62 contained in equation ( [ eq : hyper ] ) . to estimate this quantity , a detailed understanding of the processes that drive the magnetic fluctuations would be required .",
    "@xcite assumed the fluctuations are driven by tearing mode instability , but in the present paper we make no assumption about the nature of the instability .",
    "we only assume that ( 1 ) the driving process results in stochastic magnetic field lines @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; ( 2 ) reconnection occurs intermittently at many sites within this stochastic field ; ( 3 ) the reconnection events result in alfvnic perturbations that travel along the stochastic field lines until they are damped as a result of turbulent cascade .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field is not completely force free . in a non - force - free field",
    ", the magnetic torsion parameter @xmath0 can be defined as @xmath63 , and we assume that this quantity varies in a time - dependent way along the field lines .",
    "the topology of the field is continually changing as a result of the reconnection processes , with new magnetic connections being formed and other connections being severed .",
    "consider a small volume near the edge of the coronal flux rope where the mean torsion @xmath64 can be approximated as a linear function of position .",
    "let @xmath65 be the coordinate perpendicular to the surfaces of constant @xmath52 ( we assume @xmath66 ) .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath67 magnetic reconnection occurs at some localized site , creating a new magnetic connection between two neigboring surfaces @xmath65 = constant .",

    "the displacements are given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the parallel- and perpendicular length scales of the turbulent motions ( relative to the mean magnetic field ) .",
    "the torsion parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 at the two points differ by an amount @xmath79 we assume that this difference in torsion results in the launch of alfvn waves that travel in both directions along the newly formed field line . in appendix",
    "a we show that these waves carry a certain amount of magnetic helicity",
    ". the net helicity flux due to the waves can be estimated by inserting expression ( [ eq : dalpha ] ) into equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the alfvn speed , and we assume that the radius @xmath82 of the newly formed flux tube is determined by the outer scale of the turbulence , @xmath83 .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is a dimensionless constant , and we estimate it to be rather small , @xmath85 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the @xmath65-component of the helicity flux is @xmath86 where we take into account the angle of the field lines with respect to the @xmath65-direction , and we use equations ( [ eq : fluxp ] ) and ( [ eq : disp ] ) .",
    "this shows that the helicity flux @xmath40 due to the fluctuations is proportional to the local gradient of @xmath52 , as assumed in equation ( [ eq : hyper ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the following estimate for the hyperdiffusivity : @xmath87 note that @xmath54 depends strongly on the perpendicular length scale of the turbulent motions associated with the reconnection in the stochastic magnetic field .",
    "the coronal magnetic field is anchored in the photosphere where the field is highly fragmented @xcite .",
    "the photospheric field consists of vertically oriented , kilo - gauss _ flux tubes _ separated by nearly field - free plasma .",
    "these flux elements are continually buffeted by convective flows on the scale of the solar granulation , which results in random twisting of the flux tubes and a random walk of the flux elements over the solar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "cause disturbances that propagate upward along the field lines in the form of alfvn waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such disturbances produce small - scale twisting and braiding of the coronal field lines and associated field - aligned electric currents .",
    "@xcite argues that the observed widths of coronal loops are determined by these footpoint motions .",
    "the random walk of the footpoints is predicted to drive a cascade of magnetic energy from large to small spatial scales @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a cascade is confirmed by results from 3d numerical simulations of the parker problem with incompressible boundary flows .",
    "however , the twisting motions of the flux tubes may be more important than the lateral motions , as the twist velocity is amplified by the expansion of the flux tubes @xcite . at the smallest scales in the corona , impulsive reconnection events ( `` nanoflares '' )",
    "play an important role in the release of the magnetic energy @xcite .",
    "the actual dissipation may be a multi - step process involving reconnection outflows , waves , and energetic particles .",
    "@xcite have modeled the coronal heating that ultimately results from granule - scale footpoint motions .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the coronal heating rate @xmath88 has contributions from two different sources : ( 1 ) disspation of energy that was directly injected into the corona by granule - scale footpoint motions , as described above ; ( 2 ) dissipation of energy from a large - scale coronal flux rope via the process of hyperdiffusion .",
    "the former uses energy propagated upward along the field lines , while the latter draws its energy from large - scale magnetic shear already present in the corona .",
    "the direct contribution to the heating is approximately given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the position along the coronal loop , @xmath91 is the heating rate per unit volume , @xmath92 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath93 is the velocity of the perpendicular motions , @xmath94 is the correlation time of the photospheric motions , @xmath17 is the loop length , and @xmath95 .",

    "@xcite developed empirical models for nlfffs in two active regions observed with trace .",
    "our initial goal was to compute temperatures and densities for these models .",

    "the photospheric magnetic field is highly fragmented , and there are separatrix surfaces in the corona corresponding to the interfaces between photospheric flux tubes .",
    "we speculate that the reconnection events may occur at these separatrix surfaces .    in section 5 we develop a 3d model of an active region containing a magnetic flux rope , and we compute the temperature and density distributions with and without hyperdiffusion .",
    "the results show that hyperdiffusion can have a significant effect on the temperature structure , provided the perpendicular length scale of the magnetic fluctuations @xmath168 km at the coronal base .",
    "if @xmath112 were of order 100 km or less , the hyperdiffusive heating would not have a significant impact on the total heating rate for any field line .",
    "for the nlfff model considered here , the heating is concentrated in a thick shell surrounding the flux rope .",
    "the heating at the axis of the flux rope is weaker , producing a `` cavity '' similar to the coronal cavities observed on the sun .    at present",
    "there is no direct observational evidence to confirm or refute the existence of stochastic magnetic fields with perpendicular scales @xmath169 km .",
    "therefore , it is unclear exactly how coronal flux ropes are heated .",
    "coronal images obtained with the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) may provide new observational constraints on stochastic fields and the physical processes by which coronal flux ropes are heated .",
    "we thank amitava bhattacharjee for discussions about hyperdiffusion .",
    "this work was inspired by observations from hinode / xrt .",
    "the work was supported by nasa ltsa grant nng04ge77 g , and by nasa lws grant nnx06ag95 g .",
    "the transport of magnetic helicity plays an important role in the theory of hyperdiffusion . here",
    "we consider a simple model for helicity transport due to reconnection events within the stochastic field .",
    "the average time @xmath170 between reconnection events on a given flux tube is assumed to be a few times the alfvn travel time along that tube .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath67 a new section of magnetic field has just been created by reconnection .",
    "the new section connects two points @xmath68 and @xmath69 that may be located at opposite ends of a coronal loop .",
    "we neglect the loop curvature and approximate the new section as a cylindrical flux tube with radius @xmath82 .",
    "we assume that in the initial state the plasma in the tube is stationary , but the torsion parameter @xmath0 varies along the tube , so the field is not force free .",
    "the variable torsion causes the launch of counter - propagating alfvn waves that travel in opposite directions along the tube .",
    "we assume that the wave length @xmath75 of the waves is large compared to the tube radius .",
    "the medium surrounding the flux tube is assumed to be unaffected by the waves .",
    "we use a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath171 where @xmath90 is the distance along the tube ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be fixed at the end points @xmath68 ( @xmath173 ) and @xmath69 ( @xmath174 ) , so that the waves reflect at these points .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath175 inside the tube is written as @xmath176 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\hat{\\phi}$}},\\ ] ] where @xmath177 is the axial field ( constant in space and time ) , @xmath178 is the unperturbed azimuthal field at the cylinder wall ( @xmath179 ) , and @xmath180 is the perturbation of the azimuthal field due to the waves .",
    "the torsion parameter @xmath0 is defined by @xmath63 , and the perturbation of this quantity is @xmath181 the vector potential @xmath182 is obtained by solving the equations @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "continuity with the surrounding medium requires that @xmath185 is independent of @xmath90 and @xmath186 . in the limit @xmath187 ,",
    "the solution is given approximately by @xmath188 \\hat{\\bf s } , \\ ] ] where @xmath189 and we neglect a small correction @xmath190 needed to make @xmath191 exactly zero . the velocity of the waves is assumed to be purely azimuthal , @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the velocity at the cylinder wall .",
    "inserting this expression into equation ( [ eq : phi2 ] ) , we obtain the electric potential : @xmath194 where we assumed @xmath195 and required @xmath196 to ensure continuity with the surrounding medium .",
    "the axial component of the helicity flux follows from equation ( [ eq : h ] ) : @xmath197 \\cdot \\hat{\\bf s } = - \\frac{r^2 b_0 ^ 2 } { r } \\delta v_\\phi ( s , t ) .\\ ] ] the average of @xmath198 over the cross - section of the tube is @xmath199 note that the helicity flux is independent of the unperturbed azimuthal field @xmath178 .",
    "we now compute the helicity flux for damped alfvn waves . in reality",
    "the damping would likely involve a turbulent cascade of wave energy to smaller spatial scales , but here we use a simple model based on an effective `` frictional '' damping .",
    "the wave equations are @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a constant density and @xmath18 is the frictional damping time .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath202 , which implies @xmath203 at the boundaries .",
    "we assume the plasma is initially stationary , @xmath204 .",
    "the initial perturbation of the torsion parameter , @xmath205 , is assumed to be a nearly linear function of position : @xmath206 \\approx \\delta \\alpha \\left ( \\frac{s}{\\delta s } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\right ) , \\label{eq : init}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 is the perturbation amplitude ( we use @xmath208 ) .",
    "the solution of the above equations is @xmath209 , \\label{eq : wb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath210 ; @xmath211 is the amplitude of the magnetic perturbation ; @xmath212 is the effective damping rate ; @xmath213 is the mode frequency ; and @xmath214 is the frequency for an undamped mode .",
    "the above solution is valid for @xmath215 .",
    "the helicity flux at the mid - point of the tube ( @xmath216 ) follows from equations ( [ eq : hpara ] ) and ( [ eq : wv ] ) : @xmath217 where @xmath218 in the absence of damping ( @xmath219 ) , the helicity would oscillate back and forth between the two halves of the tube , and the time average of @xmath198 would vanish . with damping there is a net transport of helicity from the region with high @xmath0 to the region with low @xmath0 : @xmath220 where @xmath84 is the time average of @xmath221 .",
    "we assume that the next reconnection event occurs at a time @xmath170 which is only a few times the alfvn travel time , say , @xmath222 .",
    "then @xmath84 is given by a time average over the period @xmath223 .",
    "for a damping time @xmath18 such that @xmath224 , the time average of @xmath221 is given by @xmath85 . in section 3 we use the above expressions to estimate the hyperdiffusivity in a stochastic field ."
