    "response of nonlinear systems to a harmonic force with a single frequency has been investigated in detail .",
    "a non - monotonic variation of the amplitude of the response occurs , in a typical nonlinear system when the frequency of the driving force is varied .",
    "in particular , the oscillation amplitude of the system output increases with the increase in the frequency of the external force , it reaches a maximum at a particular frequency and then it decreases with further increase in the frequency .",
    "this resonance phenomenon is widespread and has been utilized in several devices . in bistable and multistable systems when the amplitude of the external periodic force is below a threshold ( that is , there is no switching motion between the coexisting stable states ) , then a transition between the coexisting states can be induced by a weak noise . at an appropriate optimum noise intensity",
    ", almost a periodic switching between coexisting states occurs resulting in a maximum system response .",
    "this noise - induced resonance phenomenon is termed as _ stochastic resonance _ .",
    "resonance can be realized when the noise term is replaced by a high - frequency periodic force and is called _ vibrational resonance _ .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to generate a chaotic signal that mimics the probability distribution of the gaussian white noise .",
    "such a signal can also give rise to a resonant effect analogous to the noise - induced resonance and is called _ chaotic resonance _ .",
    "in all the above resonance phenomena , in absence of a resonance inducing source , the system is driven by a weak harmonic force with a single frequency .",
    "there are signals with multiple frequencies .",
    "examples include human speech , musical tones and square - waves .",
    "design of an approximate multi - frequency signal is very important in minimizing the nonlinear distortion in the multi - frequency system identification methods .",
    "chialvo et al . investigated the response of a threshold device to an input signal containing several frequencies in the presence of noise .",
    "when the frequencies of the driving force are of a higher - order of a certain fundamental frequency , then the system is found to show a maximum response at the missing fundamental frequency at an optimum noise intensity .",
    "this fundamental frequency , which is absent in the input signal , detected by the device is called ghost - frequency and the underlying resonance phenomenon is termed as _ ghost - stochastic resonance _ . when the input signal is set into an anharmonic by introducing a same frequency shift to all the harmonic terms ,",
    "the system is found to show a resonance at a certain shifted frequency .",
    "this ghost resonance phenomenon can be used to explain the missing fundamental illusion in which a third lower pitched tone is often heard when two tones occur together .",
    "the occurrence of a ghost resonance induced by noise has been analysed mostly in excitable systems .",
    "for example , it was found in the sudden dropouts exhibited by a semiconductor laser @xcite , two laser systems coupled bidirectionally @xcite , vertical - cavity surface emitting lasers @xcite , monostable schmitt trigger electronic circuit @xcite , an excitable chua s circuit @xcite , a chaotic chua s circuit @xcite and a system of @xmath4-coupled neurons @xcite .",
    "subharmonic resonance behaviour in a nonlinear system with a multi - frequency force containing the fundamental frequency in the absence of a high - frequency input signal is studied in @xcite .    because nonlinear systems with double - well and multi - well potentials are wide - spread it is foremost important to investigate the response of these systems to the multi - frequency force and analyse the occurrence of ghost resonance in them and also with sources other than external noise .",
    "motivated by the above considerations , in the present work , we explore the possibility of a ghost resonance induced by a high - frequency deterministic force rather than a noise .",
    "we consider the duffing oscillator driven by multi - frequency force @xmath6 and a high - frequency force @xmath7 .",

    "interestingly , the case of @xmath11 by applying a theoretical method , we are able to obtain an approximate analytical expression for the response amplitudes @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "theoretical results are in good agreement with the numerical predictions .",

    "the response amplitude @xmath15 becomes @xmath20 when the oscillation center of the orbit is at the origin and this happens for @xmath14 values above a certain critical value .",
    "next , we consider a network of unidirectionally coupled @xmath21-duffing oscillators with the multi - frequency force and the high - frequency force applied to the first oscillator only .",
    "the first system is uncoupled .",
    "the coupling term is chosen to be linear .",
