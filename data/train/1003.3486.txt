    "we often think of gravitational - wave ( gw ) signals as having an oscillatory amplitude that starts small at early times , builds to some maximum , and then decays back to zero at late times .",
    "for example , this is the standard picture of a waveform from a coalescing compact - object binary .",
    "however , this picture is incomplete . in reality , _ all gravitational - wave sources _ possess some form of _ gravitational - wave memory_. the gw signal from a ` source with memory ' has the property that the late - time and early - time values of at least one of the gw polarizations differ from zero : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is time at the observer .",
    "when a gw _ without memory _ passes through a detector , it causes oscillatory deformations but eventually returns the detector to its initial state . after a gw _ with memory _",
    "has passed through an _ idealized _ detector ( one that is truly freely - falling ) , it causes a permanent deformation  leaving a ` memory ' of the waves passage .",
    "high - frequency detectors like bars or ligo are rather insensitive to the memory from most sources because the detector response timescale is generally much shorter than the _ rise - time _ of typical memory signals ( the characteristic time for the non - oscillatory piece of the gw signal to build up to its final value ) .",
    "a detector like lisa is better able to detect the memory because of its good sensitivity in the low - frequency band where typical memory sources are stronger .",
    "note also that bars and ground - based interferometers like ligo are incapable of ` storing ' a memory signal because they are not truly free : internal elastic forces push a bar back to its equilibrium shape , and magnets on the ligo test masses ( as well as its pendulum wires ) push them back to their equilibrium positions . because its proof - masses are truly freely - floating , a detector like lisa could maintain a permanent displacement .",
    "however , this late - time displacement caused by the gw memory is not directly observable without information on the prior state of the detector : the spacetime metric near a detector long after a gw with memory has passed is equivalent to flat spacetime in non - standard coordinates ( see sec .",
    "vd of @xcite for details ) .",
    "rather , it is the build - up of the memory ( the difference in the metric between late and early times ) that _ is _ observable .",
    "the memory effect has been known since the 1970 s @xcite in its linear form .",
    "the linear memory generally arises in systems with unbound components : a binary on a hyperbolic orbit ( two - body scattering ) @xcite , matter or neutrinos ejected from a supernova @xcite , or gamma - ray burst jets @xcite . in the 1990 s a nonlinear form of memory was discovered independently by blanchet & damour @xcite and christodoulou @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear memory arises from the contribution of the emitted gws to the changing quadrupole and higher mass moments . as discussed by thorne @xcite",
    ", the nonlinear memory can be described in terms of a linear memory in which the unbound masses are the individual radiated gravitons .",
    "this implies that nearly all gw sources are sources with memory ( even if the component objects remain bound ) .",
    "because the memory is a non - oscillatory effect with poor observational prospects for ligo and other ground - based interferometers , it has been largely ignored by the gw community .",
    "but for the most important ( or most studied ) gw source  quasi - circular compact binaries  the nonlinear memory has quite a large contribution to the time - domain waveform amplitude : in a post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion of the waveform polarizations , the memory effect enters at leading-(newtonian)-order ! that the memory enters at such low pn order is related to the fact that it is a _ hereditary _ effect  the memory amplitude at any retarded time depends on the entire past motion of the source ( and not just on the source s instantaneous retarded - time configuration ) . in addition , the nonlinear memory is a unique nonlinear effect because its non - oscillatory nature makes it distinctly visible in the waveform . for these reasons",
    "the memory should be studied further and its prospects for detection reassessed .    in the rest of this article",
    "i will briefly review the linear and nonlinear memory effects .",
    "i will then summarize my previous work in three areas : ( i ) computing the post - newtonian memory corrections to the gw polarizations ; ( ii ) calculating the evolution and saturation of the memory during the merger and ringdown of coalescing black hole ( bh ) binaries ; and ( iii ) estimating the ability of lisa to detect the memory from supermassive bh binary mergers .",

    "for example , the radiative mass moments are related to the source mass moments via @xmath27 i_{lm}^{(l+2)}(\\tau ) \\rmd\\tau + u_{lm}^{({\\rm{nonlin mem } } ) } + \\or(2.5{\\rm pn}).\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the @xmath29 time derivative of the mass source moment @xmath30 , the integral term is a 1.5pn order tail term , @xmath31 is the mass monopole moment , @xmath32 is an @xmath14-dependent constant , @xmath33 is an arbitrary timescale that disappears in physical observables , @xmath34 is the nonlinear memory term ( discussed below ) , and @xmath35 refers to several types of terms that enter at 2.5pn and higher orders .",
    "as a simple example of the linear memory , let s consider the waveform from a hyperbolic binary .",
    "the leading - order multipolar contribution to the polarizations is @xmath36 for a keplerian binary in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane with relative orbital separation @xmath39 , total mass @xmath40 , reduced mass ratio @xmath41 , and orbital phase angle @xmath42 , the mass quadrupole is @xmath43 . for keplerian orbits with semi - latus rectum @xmath44 , eccentricity @xmath45 , and true anomaly @xmath46 ( @xmath47 sets the periastron direction on the @xmath37-axis ) ,",

    "this difference in the late and early time values of the orbital phase angle yields a corresponding difference in the derivatives of the mass multipoles , @xmath56 resulting in a memory in the gw polarization amplitudes ( see figure [ fig : hmem ] ) .",
    "note that for a parabolic orbit ( @xmath57 ) there is no memory since the orbital phase angle returns to its early - time value .",
    "as in the above example , the linear memory always arises from a change in the mass or current _ source _ moment derivatives , @xmath58 or @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",

    "of the many nonlinear terms in @xmath77 , there is a piece that is proportional to the stress - energy tensor for gws : @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the gw energy flux and @xmath81 is a unit radial vector .",
    "when applying the green s function @xmath82 to the right - hand - side of the efe , this piece yields the following correction term to the gw field @xcite : @xmath83^{\\rm tt},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the retarded time .",
    "the time - integral in the above equation is what gives the memory its hereditary nature : the memory piece of the gw field for any value of @xmath12 depends on the entire past history of the source .",

    "when the gw field is decomposed into modes as in ( [ eq : hdecompose ] ) , the nonlinear memory can be shown to yield a correction to the radiative mass multipole moments ( [ eq : ulmrelate ] ) that enters at 2.5pn and higher orders @xcite : @xmath86 the radiative current moments @xmath87 do not have a nonlinear memory contribution .",
    "note that the energy flux is itself defined in terms of the waveform modes via @xmath88 this means that the memory is calculated in an iterative fashion : those @xmath89 modes that contain the memory are negligible in the computation of the energy flux .",
    "the memory ( linear and nonlinear ) should not be mistaken as a change in the monopolar - piece of the @xmath90 expansion of the metric .",

    "the pn waveforms computed above allow us to model the slow growth of the memory during the inspiral phase of coalescence . to determine the rest of the memory s evolution and its eventual saturation value , we need to model the merger and ringdown phases . numerical relativity ( nr ) provides the only accurate way to do this .",
    "unfortunately , the memory is not a quantity that is easily computed by current nr simulations .",
    "indeed , one may have noticed that none of the waveforms produced by recent nr simulations show any sign of memory .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , for quasi - circular inspiralling binaries the memory is not present in the commonly plotted @xmath112 mode .",
    "the memory is only present in the @xmath113 modes of the waveform . more importantly , while the memory in the metric perturbation and its @xmath114 modes can be comparable in size to the leading - order oscillatory @xmath115 modes [ see e.g. , ( [ eq : hplusquad ] ) ] , the memory contribution to @xmath116 ( the weyl scalar that nr simulations usually use to extract gws ) is suppressed by several orders - of - magnitude relative to the leading - order oscillatory piece of @xmath116 .",
    "for example at large @xmath11 , @xmath117 , and a decomposition of @xmath116 similar to ( [ eq : hdecompose ] ) implies that its modes @xmath118 are related to the metric perturbation modes via @xmath119 . during the inspiral",
    "the metric modes be can decomposed into an amplitude @xmath120 that slowly evolves on a radiation - reaction timescale @xmath121 , and a phase that oscillates on an orbital timescale @xmath122 : @xmath123 . then for oscillatory ( @xmath92 ) modes @xmath118 is smaller by two factors of the orbital time , @xmath124 , but for memory ( @xmath113 ) modes @xmath125 is smaller by two factors of the radiation - reaction time , @xmath126 .",
    "this means that the @xmath125 memory modes are smaller than the oscillatory @xmath118 modes by 5pn orders .",
    "the memory modes of @xmath116 are therefore a small correction superimposed on the much larger oscillatory pieces of @xmath116 and are thus difficult to resolve in a numerical simulation .    aside from this problem ,",
    "there is also the issue of computing the two integration constants needed to go from @xmath118 to @xmath89 .",
    "berti et .",
    "al @xcite showed that choosing these constants incorrectly leads to an ` artificial memory ' that shows up in all ( @xmath127 ) modes .",
    "one approach to computing these constants correctly is to match the nr waveform modes onto the pn waveform modes .",
    "some of the above problems can be ameliorated by using a wave - extraction formalism that directly computes the metric waveform without the need to compute @xmath116 and integrate twice .",
    "however another problem arises that also affects metric - extraction schemes : the sensitivity of the nonlinear memory to the distant past requires large initial binary separations ( @xmath128 ) to compute the @xmath114 modes accurately .",
    "see sec .",
    "vc of @xcite for further discussion of these issues .",
    "since nr simulations of the coalescence memory are not yet available , we need to investigate other approaches .",
    "a first attempt by kennefick @xcite took the leading - order inspiral memory [ ( [ eq : hplusquad ] ) , which grows as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the coalescence time ] and assumed that it abruptly stops growing at a time corresponding to a specified ( and somewhat arbitrary ) orbital separation ( roughly the last - stable - orbit ) .",
    "this approach truncates the memory too early and does not incorporate its smooth build - up during the merger and ringdown .    to improve upon kennefick s analysis",
    "we begin by introducing the so - called _ minimal waveform model _ ( mwm ) .",
    "the purpose of the mwm is to use information from nr and the effective - one - body ( eob ) @xcite approach to construct a very simple , fully - analytic waveform that qualitatively contains the basic features of a binary bh coalescence waveform .",
    "the mwm simply consists of matching the leading - order inspiral waveform to a ringdown waveform .",
    "for example , the @xmath131 time - derivative of the @xmath132 mode is approximated as @xmath133 where @xmath134 , @xmath135^{1/4}$ ] , @xmath136 , @xmath137 are the bh quasi - normal mode frequencies and damping times @xcite ( these depend on the final bh mass and spin which are determined from nr simulations ) , and @xmath138 is a ` matching time ' at which @xmath139 .",
    "the matching radius @xmath140 is an adjustable parameter that determines the peak of the waveform amplitude ; i choose the value @xmath141 corresponding to the schwarzschild light - ring . the coefficients @xmath142 are determined by matching ( [ eq : mwm22 ] ) at @xmath143 for @xmath144 .    for quasi - circular orbits , the leading - order piece of the memory is sourced by the @xmath145 oscillatory waveform mode . to compute its contribution to the memory , substitute the @xmath146 expansion of the energy flux ( [ eq : dedtdomega - hlm ] ) into ( [ eq : ulmmem ] ) to yield @xmath147 and the corresponding @xmath114 modes .",
    "the resulting memory contribution to @xmath148 is @xmath149 this reduces to a simple analytic expression when the mwm ( [ eq : mwm22 ] ) is substituted ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the effect of including higher - order waveform modes in ( [ eq : dedtdomega - hlm ] ) is currently under investigation .",
    "because the memory ( [ eq : memhplus ] ) depends only on the amplitude of the @xmath145 mode and not its phase , the mwm provides a reasonably accurate description of the memory . as an alternative to this simple analytic model",
    ", one can use an eob description of the @xmath145 mode and substitute this into ( [ eq : memhplus ] ) .",
    "this approach is more accurate because the eob waveforms are calibrated to nr simulations .",
    "both methods were implemented and compared in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hmem ] shows the memory resulting from the eob - based model .",
    "although the memory has most of its power at near - zero frequency , the build - up of the memory distributes power in a range of frequencies . as a simple estimate of the memory s detectability with gw interferometers",
