    "the main tool we use is the friendship graph of a representation .",
    "namely the ( full ) friendship graph of a representation @xmath0 of a braid group @xmath1 is a graph whose vertices are the set of generators @xmath24 @xmath25 of @xmath1 .",

    "when the graph is a chain , we get specializations of the representation discovered by tong , yang and ma .",
    "now we are going to explain the place of this paper in the coming series . according to @xcite , theorem 23 , for @xmath5 large enough",
    "every irreducible complex representation of @xmath1 of dimension at most @xmath6 is a tensor product of a one - dimensional representation and a representation of corank 1 . using similar ideas",
    "one can show that for @xmath5 large enough every irreducible complex representation of @xmath1 of dimension at most @xmath5 is a tensor product of a one - dimensional representation and a representation of corank 2 .",
    "therefore one can use the results of this paper to extend the classification theorem of formanek to the representations of @xmath1 of dimension @xmath31 the proof of this result will appear elsewhere .",
    "another result , which will appear elsewhere is that for @xmath5 large enough there are no irreducible complex representations of @xmath1 of corank 3 and no irreducible complex representations of @xmath1 of dimension @xmath32 .",
    "based on the above result we would like to make the following two conjectures .    for every @xmath33 for @xmath5",
    "large enough there are no irreducible complex representations of @xmath1 of corank @xmath34    for every @xmath35 for @xmath5 large enough there are no irreducible complex representations of @xmath1 of dimension @xmath36    we should also note that for the purpose of brevity we did not include in this paper some of the details of the classification of representations of @xmath1 for small @xmath31 the full proof can be found in our thesis @xcite , chapters 6 and 7 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce some convenient notation that will be used throughout the rest of the paper . in section 3",
    "we define the friendship graph of the representation and study its structure .",
    "we also study the case when the friendship graph is totally disconnected . in section 4 we prove that for @xmath37 for any irreducible complex representation of @xmath1 of corank @xmath28 and dimension at least @xmath5 the associated friendship graph is a chain . in section 5",
