    "helicity , together with energy , is an inviscid invariant of three - dimensional navier - stokes equation and it is known to play a key role both for hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical systems  @xcite . in previous works  @xcite we have shown that by constraining the velocity field to develop fluctuations with only one sign of helicity , the energy flows backward : from the forced scale to the largest scale in the system , without reaching a steady state if not confined on a finite box or without the addition of external friction .",
    "more recently , we have shown that the inverse cascade regime , observed for the fully helical case , is highly fragile  @xcite : it is enough to have a tiny number of helical modes with the opposite sign distributed uniformly on the fourier space to revert the system to a forward cascade regime .",
    "such a conclusion is also supported by arguments based on absolute equilibrium  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the case when all fourier modes have the same helicity ( say positive ) except for a small subset possessing also the opposite ( negative ) helicity .",

[ fig1 ] ) . in  @xcite , studying the instability of the energy exchange among modes of each single triad , it was argued that the triads in class iii and class iv transfer energy from the smallest wavenumber to the other two wavenumbers and are responsible for the forward cascade of energy . whereas for the triads in class i and class ii , the fourier mode with the medium wavenumber transfers energy to the other two fourier modes",

    "the presence of competing interactions might suggest that the direction of the energy transfer mechanism is not set _ a priori_. depending on the empirical realization ( the forcing scheme , the boundary conditions , the coupling with other active dynamical fields as for the case of conducting flows  @xcite ) different directions of the energy could be developed . as said , in the whole system where all triads are present and with a neutral homogeneous and isotropic external forcing",

    "it was observed  @xcite that presence of few percent of modes with opposite sign of helicity changes the direction of energy transfer in a singular manner : a few modes with both sign of helicity at all scales , even though one type is a small fraction of other type , allows formation of triads with two largest wavenumbers having opposite signs of helicity which efficiently transfers energy to the small scales .",

    "therefore , a statistically stable system means that a stable large scale helical condensate is formed with an energy large enough to be dissipated directly by molecular viscosity .",

    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "it is striking to note that in the steady state the negative helical modes , existing only at @xmath84 , carry almost all the energy of the system , signaling that the inverse energy cascade process is very efficient to move energy to the opposite helical modes via class ii interactions .",
    "moreover , the negative helical modes act as sinks and do not allow the inverse cascade to proceed further to larger scales , stabilizing a condensate to a given wavenumber , independent of the size of the box .",
    "a statistically stationary state is then reached only when molecular drag becomes efficient at such scales .",
    "initially the growth of energy is in the positive helical modes , shown in the insets of panels ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , for the case @xmath83 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we see that at initial times ( @xmath88 ) the growth of energy in the large scales ( @xmath89 ) is due to an inverse transfer to the positive helical modes .",
    "this transfer is driven by triads of class i. when the negative helical modes at @xmath84 becomes energetic enough ( @xmath90 ) the positive helical modes start to be depleted , leading for later times ( @xmath91 ) to a configuration where all the energy is concentrated only on the @xmath92 , albeit they correspond to a small minority of the total number of degrees - of - freedom .",
    "figure  [ fig3](c ) shows the flux of total energy as a function of time .",
    "we observe a persistent constant positive flux corresponding to inverse cascade of energy in the range @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "this confirms that also triads of class ii lead to a reverse energy cascade .",
    "the energy is then directly dissipated by the viscous effect which becomes substantial for the highly energetic negative helical modes .",

    "let us stress that the viscous contribution does not match exactly the nonlinear transfer because the energy is still growing in time .",
    "simulations for the case where @xmath98 reach a steady state earlier and they show a much better matching between the two contributions , see below panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "let us also notice that a sort of @xmath99 scaling is observed in the inverse cascade regime as for the case when only class i triads are present  @xcite , at least up to the time when the condensate does not become too energetic to spoil the scaling properties .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the results from the case where @xmath100 .",
    "the main interest to select this window is that in this way we can change the degree of nonlocality of the triad geometry . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that in the scaling regime triads of class ii should display either a forward or a reverse energy transfer depending whether the ration between the smallest and the medium wavenumber @xmath101 is larger or smaller than 0.278 .",
    "if we assume that the main energy transfer happens via a triad where two wavenumbers fall in the forced range and the other belong to the negative helical modes then we have @xmath102 for @xmath100 and @xmath103 for @xmath83 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we observe an inverse energy transfer also for @xmath102 contradicting the prediction made by  @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the absence of any scaling regime for the configuration of forced and negative helical modes chosen here , as shown by panel ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and therefore our configuration does not satisfy the assumptions made in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4](d ) shows the balance of @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the wavenumbers @xmath106 $ ] which confirms that negative helical modes lose energy due to molecular dissipation in such case .      in this second set of simulations we forced at @xmath107 $ ] and kept the negative helical modes only for larger wavenumbers , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the behavior of the growth of energy is similar to the cases of @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "after the negative helical modes become energetic they continue to accumulate energy and then reach a steady state by dissipating energy directly via molecular viscosity .",
    "however the dynamics of energy transfer is entirely different from previous cases as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show the spectrum for the total energy and for the positive helical modes respectively . as before , the difference between the two gives the energy content in the negative helical modes . in the beginning",
    "we initialize the field at the forced scales and we observe a clear inverse cascade of energy to large scales , shown by the energy spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) and in the positive energy flux in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) at @xmath110 .",
    "this transfer is due to the triads of class i. then , as soon as the negative helical modes become energetic enough , the triads of class iii and class iv take the lead and the energy flux is reversed toward the negative helical modes at scales smaller than the forced ones from times @xmath111 and larger .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the positive helical modes at large scales ( @xmath89 ) also lose their energy by a forward cascade , probably highly nonlocal .",
    "figure  [ fig6](c ) shows the evolution of the energy flux during the backward and forward regimes .",
    "panel ( d ) of the same figure compares the viscous contribution and the nonlinear flux .",
    "the figure shows that in the late stationary regime the viscous drag , induced by the high energy content of the negative helical modes , is balanced with the nonlinear flux . in this case",
    "we have a small - scales condensate that adsorbs all energy flowing between modes at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that positive helical modes at @xmath114 do not receive energy from the negative helical modes at @xmath87 as they could only form triads of class ii which are responsible for inverse energy transfer .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , both experiments leads to a sort of helical condensate concentrated on the wavenumbers where the negative helical modes exists .",
    "this is a different way to produce ( and stabilize ) strong nonlinear structures in navier - stokes equations with respects to the well known case of two - dimensional turbulence  @xcite .",
    "a visualization of the vorticity field where an inverse cascade of energy is observed is shown in fig .",
    "[ visual](a ) .",
    "the presence of helical stable structures is clearly detectable . in panel ( b ) of the same figure we show similar small - scales condensates that populate the flow when @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath109",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if one can highlight some universality properties of such configurations as done for the two - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "we have performed several numerical simulations of a modified ( decimated ) version of the three - dimensional navier - stokes equations by keeping only some subsets of fourier modes with different helical properties .",
    "the aim is to further understand the different roles played by triads with different helical structures in the dynamics of the nonlinear energy transfer mechanism .",
    "we have shown that as predicted in @xcite there exist two classes ( class i and class ii ) of triads that transfer energy to large scales , i.e. which can support an inverse cascade even in fully homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ( but not mirror symmetric ) .",
    "this result for class i where all modes have the same helical sign was already known  @xcite . the second class ( here called class ii )",
    "is made of triads where helicity is not globally sign - definite .",
    "the structure is such that the mode with the different helicity is the one at the smallest wavenumbers .",
    "hence , when the small - scales are strongly helically - signed the forward energy transfer is depleted .",
    "the existence of inverse cascade even when helicity is not positive - definite contradicts the predictions based only on the absolute equilibrium in the inviscid and unforced limit  @xcite .",
    "+ by concentrating the negative helical modes at small scales ( high wavenumbers ) we showed that as soon as triads of the other two classes ( class iii and class iv ) become competitive , they take the leadership in the energy transfer mechanisms and the energy flux is reversed , reaching a more standard forward - cascade regime . in both cases the energy is preferentially transferred to the minority helical modes ( here negative ) , leading to either a large - scale condensate or to a small - scales condensate .",
    "our study further supports the idea that the direction of the energy transfer in a turbulent flow might strongly be influenced by the helicity distribution among different scales  @xcite .",

    "<S> we select different set of triads participating in the dynamics on the basis of their helicity content . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we remove the negative helically polarized fourier modes at all wavenumbers except for those falling on a localized shell of wavenumber , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> changing @xmath1 to be above or below the forcing scale , @xmath2 , we are able to assess the energy transfer of triads belonging to different interaction classes . we observe that when the negative helical modes are present only at wavenumber smaller than the forced wavenumbers , an inverse energy cascade develops with an accumulation of energy on a stationary helical condensate . </S>",
    "<S> vice versa , when negative helical modes are present only at wavenumber larger than the forced wavenumbers , a transition from backward to forward energy transfer is observed in the regime when the minority modes become energetic enough . </S>"
