    "understanding galaxy formation and evolution is one of the central goals of contemporary astronomy and cosmology .",
    "high - redshift observations provide insight into the evolution of global galaxy properties , but are fundamentally limited in probing the internal kinematics and chemistry on sub - galactic scales .",
    "the milky way is the only galaxy within which we can obtain information at the level of detail required to understand these processes .",
    "this realization is manifested in the number of on - going and planned spectroscopic milky way surveys , such as rave @xcite , segue @xcite , apogee @xcite , hermes @xcite , gaia - eso @xcite , gaia @xcite , and 4most @xcite , which aim at obtaining kinematic and chemical information for a large number of stars . despite the increasing amounts of observational data , to date",
    "we have lacked the means to discriminate among different thick - disc formation scenarios and to understand the disc merger history in general . here",
    "we fill this gap .",
    "stars near the sun have long been known to follow an age - velocity relation , where velocity dispersions increase with age @xcite . due to the lack of good age estimates ,",
    "the shape of the age - velocity relation has been a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , such as [ mg / fe ] can be used to identify the oldest stars because the interstellar medium is quickly enriched in elements formed by @xmath0-capture in short - lived massive stars while there is a delay before iron - peak elements are produced in abundance by thermonuclear supernovae ( snia ) @xcite .    studying the segue g - dwarf sample , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have recently argued that the stellar vertical velocity dispersion increases for populations of decreasing metallicity and increasing [ @xmath0/fe ] , but this relation has been somewhat unclear at the low - metallicity end .",
    "we re - examine the @xmath2-[fe / h]-[@xmath0/fe ] connection by presenting it in a different way compared to earlier works : instead of color maps , here we overlay curves of velocity dispersion with [ mg / fe ] for only six different metallicity bins allowing for better statistics in the low metallicity regime where the number of stars gets small .",
    "we study data from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) @xcite .",
    "rave is a magnitude - limited survey of stars randomly selected in the @xmath3 magnitude range and is presently the largest spectroscopic sample of stars in the milky way for which individual elemental abundances are available @xcite .    for the present work we selected a rave sample of giant stars , which is close to a random magnitude - limited sample .",
    "we excluded giants with log g  @xmath4 to avoid any possible effects due to the boundaries of the learning grid used for the automated parameterization and considered stars in the temperature range @xmath5 ( thus avoiding horizontal branch stars , see @xcite ) .    the estimated total measurement uncertainties ( internal plus external ) of the new rave - dr4 pipeline for giants ( log g  @xmath6  dex ) with sn  @xmath7 in the temperature and metallicity range we consider in the present work ( @xmath8  [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 ) are ( see table 2 in @xcite ) @xmath10  k in @xmath11 , @xmath12  dex for log g , and @xmath13 for the metallicity [ m / h ] .",
    "the final uncertainties in [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] computed by the chemical pipeline are @xmath13 and 0.15  dex , respectively . to further decrease these",
    ", we select a sample of giants with sn  @xmath14 , resulting in 4755 stars with high - quality chemistry and kinematics .",
    "the mean uncertainties in galactocentric velocities are 10 - 15 km / s .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the black - dashed curve shows the variation with [ mg / fe ] of the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to the expected monotone increase of @xmath2 with @xmath0-enhancement , we see a strong inversion in this trend at [ mg / fe ]  @xmath1  dex .",
    "this is unexpected because stars with higher [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , at a given radius , should be older and , thus , should possess larger random energies .",
    "the six metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) bins , shown by color - coded curves , allow us to probe deeper .",
    "we see that for [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , @xmath2 is independent of [ fe / h ] and a slowly increasing function of [ mg / fe ] but that for more metal - poor stars @xmath2 increases with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "an interesting observation is the distinct decrease in @xmath2 at the high-[mg / fe ] end of all but one [ fe / h ] subpopulation , with the @xmath2-maximum shifting to lower [ mg / fe ] for bins of increasing metallicity . for all velocity components , the most metal - poor , @xmath0-rich stars ( which must be the oldest ) have velocity dispersions comparable to those of the most metal - rich ( youngest ) populations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] we show that this puzzling behavior can be explained by radial migration of old cold stellar samples from the inner disc .",
    "the results we obtained here with rave data should be seen in other ongoing / near - future galactic surveys .",
    "we check this by studying the currently available segue g - dwarf sample described by @xcite , by considering stars with sn  @xmath16 . due to the lack of individual chemical element measurements in segue",
    ", we use their [ @xmath0/fe ] , which is the average of several @xmath0-elements . because of the low number of stars at @xmath17  kpc in segue , a maximum distance above and below the disc plane of @xmath18  kpc is used ( instead of @xmath19  kpc ) .",
    "this results in a sample comprising @xmath20  10300 stars .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] presents the same information as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , but for segue .",
    "we recover the expected strong decline in the vertical and radial velocity dispersions , @xmath2 and @xmath21 , for the most metal - poor samples .",
    "while no reversal is found in the dispersion of the azimuthal velocity component , @xmath22 , for the total sample , the expected trend is seen for the intermediate metallicity sub - populations ( blue and orange curves ) and hinted in the most metal - poor bin ( maroon ) .",
    "this assures that our findings are not pertinent to rave data only , but should be a general result .",
    "we note that the same trend is hinted in fig.2 by @xcite , but less clear possibly due to the cut of sn  @xmath23 , larger [ @xmath0/fe ] bins , and larger disk coverage more prone to erase structure that may vary spatially .",
    "the highest velocity dispersions ( @xmath24  km / s and @xmath25  km / s ) achieved by the lowest three metallicity bins are too large to be accounted for by internal disc evolution processes , such as scattering by giant molecular clouds @xcite , the spiral arms @xcite , or the galactic bar @xcite . on the other hand , perturbations by mergers at the early times of disc formation",
    "@xcite clumpy disc instabilities @xcite , stars born hot at high redshift @xcite , and/or accreted stellar populations @xcite can be a plausible explanation .",
    "we test the possibility that mergers of decreasing satellite - to - disc - mass ratios and frequency ( including stars born hot at high redshift ) have caused the trends we find in rave giant stars , by using simulated data from a chemo - dynamical model @xcite built by the fusion between a high - resolution galaxy simulation in the cosmological context with milky way characteristics and a detailed chemical evolution model . a strong perturbation from the last massive merger ( 1:5 disc mass ratio 8 - 9 gyr before the present ) plays an important role in the disc evolution .",
    "due to its in - plane orbit ( inclination less than @xmath26 ) , this event drives strong radial migration by triggering spiral structure .",
    "similar , but less intense events occur throughout the disc evolution .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] presents the same information as figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] , but for the model .",
    "a very good agreement is found between the data and model for the velocity dispersion trends of different metallicity subpopulations .    the stars with the highest [ @xmath0/fe]-ratios and lowest [ fe / h ] form in the inner disc at the onset of disc formation in an inside - out disc formation scenario .",
    "radial migration can then bring these to the solar vicinity , contaminating the locally evolved sample .",
    "because of the very fast initial chemical evolution , stars with [ mg / fe ] @xmath27  dex and [ fe / h ]  @xmath28  dex have approximately the same age , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , top . these stars , being the oldest disc population , have the longest time available for migration to the solar vicinity .",
    "however , because migration efficiency decreases with increasing velocity dispersion , stars with cold kinematics would be affected the most @xcite .",
    "this is the case for the stars in the metallicity bin with median [ fe / h ]  @xmath29  dex ( red curve ) , which are seen to migrate the largest distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , bottom ) .      figures  [ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] showed that the decline in velocity dispersion for stars with the highest [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in rave and segue data can be interpreted as the effect of stars born in the innermost disc .",
    "for this to occur , some of the oldest disc stars must have migrated from the inner disc to the solar neighborhood , while remaining on near - circular orbits , significantly cooler than coeval samples born at progressively larger radii .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we now check whether this is indeed that case , using the same simulated sample as in all previous figures .",
    "the black - dashed curve shows that , for the total sample , the final vertical velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , increases with decreasing mean birth radius , @xmath30 .",
    "naively , this could be interpreted as evidence that the local disc heats as a result of the migration . however , by decomposing this sample into mono - age populations , we find that the continuous increase in @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath30 is caused by the growing fraction of younger stars born near their current locations , i.e. , the solar circle . the fact that stars migrating from the inner disc are generally hotter is related to their older ages allowing them to be exposed to perturbations causing both heating @xcite and migration @xcite . however , for most coeval populations ( color curves ) there exists the general trend of @xmath2 decreasing with decreasing @xmath30 , which becomes more important for older samples . for the next - to - oldest population , stars originating near the galactic center arrive to the solar vicinity colder by  35 km / s compared to those born near the sun . it is clearly seen that stars arriving from the inner disc can be both cooler and older than a locally born sample , which explains the observations .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] illustrated that that cooler / warmer populations can arrive from the inner / outer disc during mergers but this trend reverses as external perturbations become unimportant .",
    "therefore , there must exist a critical time at which the disc enters from the first regime into the second .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows that in our model this reversal occurs at @xmath20age  @xmath31  gyr ( dark blue lines ) .",
    "future work can try to relate this to observations using chemical information .      from the above discussion",
    "it follows that the decrease in the velocity dispersion for the highest-[mg / fe ] stars in the model is a sign that they have arrived in the solar vicinity kinematically cooler than the locally born coeval population .",
    "this conclusion is remarkable , as stars migrating outward due to internal instabilities alone are expected to heat the disc ( @xcite , even if only weakly ",
    "the opposite behavior we find here must be related to the presence of mergers in our simulation .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows that metal - poor stars with [ mg / fe ]  @xmath32  dex ( which cause the decline in velocity dispersion for the model - red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) arrive from progressively smaller galactic radii , while having approximately the same age .",
    "similarly to the most metal - poor stars , the inversion in the @xmath2-[mg / fe ] relation for the other [ fe / h ] subpopulation can be related to mergers of diminishing strength perturbing the milky way disc throughout its lifetime . within this interpretation ,",
    "the properties of these events can be recovered in a differential study .",
    "for example , satellite - to - disc - mass ratios and orbital parameters can be related to the mean velocity dispersions of metallicity bins and the inversion in the velocity dispersion profiles as functions of [ mg / fe ] , for each velocity component .",
    "in this work we presented a new chemo - kinematic relation in rave giants , where a decline in the velocity dispersion was found for stars with [ mg / fe ]  @xmath1  dex , as well as for samples in narrow ranges of [ fe / h ] .",
    "we verified that another big data set  the segue g - dwarfs  shows similar relations . by comparing to a chemodynamical model , we explained these results as the stronger effect of mergers on the outer parts of discs and the subsequent radial migration of older stellar populations with cooler kinematics born in the inner disc .    the interpretation of our results  that we see the effect of satellite perturbations on the disc  is not strongly model dependent because ( i ) mergers are expected to always affect more significantly the outer disc @xcite , ( ii ) a general prediction of inside - out - formation chemical evolution models is a fast decrease in [ @xmath0/fe ] with increasing radius for stars in a narrow metallicity range , at high redshift @xcite , and ( iii ) radial migration has been firmly accepted to be inseparable part of disc evolution in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it may be possible that debris accreted from a disrupted galaxy @xcite , which should possess the highest velocity dispersions in the disc , had just the right chemistry to create the maximum we observe at [ mg / fe ] = 0.4 dex , although to explain the @xmath2-maxima of all [ fe / h ] bins this interpretation requires a series of mergers of exactly the right increasing metallicity .",
    "furthermore , accretion would not explain the exceedingly low velocity dispersion values for the most @xmath0-rich stars , which must be linked to radial migration of stars born in the inner disc .",
    "the gas - rich turbulent clumpy - disc formation scenario for the thick disc may also provide a viable explanation but in conjunction with perturbations from mergers ( making it similar to our model and @xcite ) , necessary to produce the observed decline in velocity dispersion at the high-[@xmath0/fe ] end of each metallicity subpopulation .",
    "finally , a quiescent evolution scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the milky way thick disc formed by heating an initially thin disc through internal evolution processes only , is unfeasible , given that in that case stars arriving from the inner disc should be slightly hotter than the locally born population @xcite , i.e. , the contrary to what the observations suggest .",
    "the stars with the lowest [ fe / h ] and highest [ mg / fe ] ratios identified in this work possess the chemistry and kinematics , which allow them to be associated with the oldest milky way population born in the bar / bulge region .",
    "although currently efforts are made to look for these in the inner galaxy , we have shown that , thanks to radial migration , one can also study them here in the solar vicinity .",
    "while the milky way has been seen as an unusually quiet galaxy in view of the predictions by the @xmath33cdm theory @xcite , the results of this work suggests that , in addition to being important for the formation of the thick disc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , satellite - disc encounters of decreasing intensity were at play throughout its evolution .      with the availability of stellar ages in the near future from the gaia mission , it will become possible to confirm or rule out the currently proposed explanation for the observed chemo - kinematic relations , by requiring that the data are also reproduced by fig .  [ fig : fig4 ] . if confirmed in the number of ongoing and forthcoming galactic surveys , our discovery would provide a missing piece in the current understanding of the milky way disc evolution .",
