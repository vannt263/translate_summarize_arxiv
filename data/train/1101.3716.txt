    "the first option however would produce a contradiction , since the iterative procedure could then be applied to the remaining configuration of stubs giving rise to edges that would have been created already in the original procedure .    that the resulting multi - matching is stable subject to the prescribed ( random ) directions follows from the definition : an unstable pair of points  that is , a pair @xmath12 and @xmath35 with @xmath33 with no edge between them and where @xmath12 ( @xmath35 ) has an edge connected to the right ( left ) of @xmath35 ( @xmath12 ) ",

    "we proceed by formulating a version of the mass transport principle suitable for our needs . for background , see @xcite .",

    "the expected mass sent out from the unit interval is however bounded by 1 , so we have a contradiction with the mass transport principle .    finally , the following result will be of use in proving theorem [ th : stable](b ) .
