    "fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) has become very important tool in modern probability and statistical modeling .",
    "fractional brownian motion is defined as a gaussian process with certain covariance structure . besides of this definition , fbm could be represented equivalently as an integral of a deterministic kernel with respect to an ordinary brownian motion .",
    "in fact , there exist at least two such kernels : mandelbrot - van ness kernel that has infinite support and compactly supported molchan - golosov kernel .",
    "fractional brownian motion allows to model dependency because of its covariance structure .",
    "hence it is a popular model in many applications .",
    "there is one parameter , namely hurst parameter @xmath0 that describes the whole dependence structure . for hurst parameter",
    "@xmath1 the process has long - range dependence property . for @xmath2 the increments are negatively correlated and for @xmath3 the increments are independent i.e. we come to the ordinary brownian motion case .",
    "of course , fbm has also several other properties such as self - similarity and stationarity of increments . despite of all these properties ,",
    "fbm is neither semimartingale nor markov process ( excluding the brownian motion case @xmath3 ) .",
    "if one is interested in fbm because of its correlation structure , one might not need exactly fbm but just some process with the same covariance structure .",
    "the law of a gaussian process is determined uniquely by its second order structure .",
    "however , if we drop the assumption of gaussianity , then the covariance structure does not determine the law uniquely .",
    "thus , there are several possible ways to generalize fractional brownian motion to the case of fractional lvy processes . by choosing different ways of generalization",
    ", we preserve different properties of fbm .    in this paper",
    "we define fractional lvy processes by two different integral transformations .",
    "this means basically that we take the integral representation of fractional brownian motion with respect to an ordinary brownian motion and replace the driving brownian motion with a general square integrable lvy process .",
    "the processes that we will end up with , share the covariance structure of fractional brownian motion . however , these processes could be more flexible in modeling than fractional brownian motion , since the driving lvy noise is more general than the gaussian one .",
    "for example , we might be able to capture such a phenomenon as a shock in the stock market ( jump of the driving lvy process ) that affects the market with delay and has some long term impacts .",

    "there are also several other related concepts in the literature .",

    "we can write the characteristic exponent of the driving lvy process as follows @xmath262 prove only the second statement , the first one can be proved in a similar way .",
    "we use the representation formula for the characteristic function of fractional lvy process and get that the fourth cumulant of the flpmg @xmath66 is given by @xmath263 analogously the fourth cumulant of the flpmvn @xmath65 is @xmath264 note that iff the lvy measure @xmath38 is nondegenerate , @xmath265 .",
    "our aim is now to prove that with the assumption @xmath67 the fourth cumulants of different flp s are different .",

    "for @xmath266 the 4th cumulant of flpmg @xmath66 is infinite by lemma  [ ikm ] . on the other hand",
    "the corresponding cumulant for flpmvn @xmath65 is finite by lemma  [ fkm ] .",
    "the case @xmath267 uses lemma [ mgbound ] , and we immediately obtain the proof .    next we proof proposition  [ mainimproved ] .",
