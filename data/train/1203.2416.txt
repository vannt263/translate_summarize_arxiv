    "massive stars play an important role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "once they are born , their outflows , intense uv radiation , and stellar winds influence the nearby interstellar medium , and their feedback could induce the next generation of star formation @xcite . however , the formation mechanism of massive stars is still unclear .",
    "one of reasons for this is that massive protostars are very embedded , and hence can only be seen in infrared and radio .",
    "since the @xmath0 space telescope was launched , it has provided a good chance to study this early phase of star formation .",
    "@xmath0 provides better resolution than previous infrared space telescopes ( @xmath6 at irac bands ) , and is able to survey large regions . in the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) i survey at irac wavelengths ( @xmath7 ; @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite identified more than 300 massive outflow candidates in the galactic plane .",
    "these candidates show excess emission at 4.5  @xmath1 , and have been dubbed `` extended green objects ( egos ) '' due to the common practice of assigning blue , green and red to 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8  @xmath1 bands in images .",
    "the most common explanation is that they are outflows from massive young stars , due to their association with irdcs , thought to be the birthplace of massive stars , and with class ii 6.7 ghz masers which are radiatively pumped by massive ysos @xcite .",
    "the 4.5  @xmath1 emission may come from h@xmath3 ( @xmath9 = 00 , s(9 , 10 , 11 ) ) and/or co ( @xmath9 = 10 ) band heads @xcite which can be excited by shocks from outflows @xcite .    since their identification",
    ", there have been several attempts to investigate the nature of these egos .",
    "approximately two - third of egos are associated with class i 44  ghz methanol masers @xcite which are likely to be an outflow tracer .",
    "later , high resolution vla observations showed that class ii methanol masers are tightly concentrated around 24  @xmath1 sources , and class i masers tracing molecular outflows are widely distributed around the diffuse 4.5  @xmath1 emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used outflow tracers ( hco@xmath10 ) to survey egos , and their line profiles also indicate the presence of outflows . egos ( or green fuzzies , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been seen in known massive star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , irdc cores @xcite , and jets associated with low - mass protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "molecular line interferometric observations can also help to identify outflows from massive ysos , and provide higher resolution and kinematic information for outflows ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "ego  g11.92@xmath110.61 and g19.01@xmath110.03 were observed using sma and carma @xcite .",
    "both of them have bipolar molecular outflows , coincident with the 4.5  @xmath1 lobes .",
    "the above mentioned studies give evidence that some egos are related to outflows ; however it is unclear if the 4.5  @xmath1 emission in egos comes from line emission or not .",
    "the best way to answer this question is to take spectra of egos in the irac 4.5  @xmath1 band .",
    "the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on - board @xmath0 can observe only wavelengths longer than 5.3  @xmath1 , so irs itself can not directly determine the source of diffuse 4.5  @xmath1 emission . to determine the origin of what they denote as `` green fuzzies '' , @xcite took spectra of two egos ( ego  g19.88@xmath110.53 and ego  g49.27@xmath110.34 ) in @xmath12- ( 2.95  4.12  @xmath1 ) and @xmath13- ( 4.47  5.75  @xmath1 ) bands .",
    "one of them ( ego g19.88 - 0.53 ) does exhibit pure molecular hydrogen line emission at 4.695  @xmath1 ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , which dominates in the wavelength range 45  @xmath1 ( no co band heads are detected ) .",
    "this result supports the idea that the green fuzzy emission is excited by outflow shocks .",
    "however , the other source ( ego g49.27 - 0.34 ) only shows continuum emission in the above spectral ranges without line emission .",
    "they suggested that the green fuzzy emission is the result of extinction and a magnification in the color stretch in the 4.5  @xmath1 band . in this paper , we use h@xmath3 , @xmath5- , and @xmath4-band observations from the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) to study the near - infrared properties of egos .",
    "near - infrared h@xmath3 1 - 0 s(1 ) observations have been used to study shock - excited outflows from ysos @xcite , and provide a good resolution ( @xmath161@xmath17 ) which allows us to study the morphologies of h@xmath3 outflows in detail .",
    "compared with continuum images of spitzer , our continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 images , which focus on shock - excited h@xmath3 line emission , are helpful for determining if the egos are associated with h@xmath3 outflows or not .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the criterion is not only restricted to the ego s positions , but also extended to a 20@xmath17 radius , as the morphologies of h@xmath3 outflows may be more extended than those of @xmath4-band continuum . besides these preselected 12 egos ,",

    "the hourglass shape outflow is unlikely to be a composite of two collimated outflows at different directions , because the shapes , lengths , and intensities of mho 2431c and d are similar ( figure  [ fig : g35.20 - 0.74 ] ) .",

    "this @xmath5-band emission is not likely to be due to shocked emission , since ( 1 ) the flux distribution is significantly different between h@xmath3 and @xmath4-band emission ; and ( 2 ) shocked emission in the @xmath5-band should be so faint that it is not likely to be observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
