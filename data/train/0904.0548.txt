    "in the last thirty years , electron scattering experiments on nuclei have produced an enormous amount of high - precision , accurate and reliable data which impose severe constraints on nuclear models and theories .",
    "our interest is focused on the excitation of unnatural parity states in the low - lying region of the nuclear spectrum , where many responses of several nuclei have been measured @xcite .",
    "the description of these states with effective theories , such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , indicates a strong sensitivity to the details of the spin and tensor dependent terms of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) effective interactions . while the study of a single excited state , or of a limited set of excited states , for a single nucleus has been pursued in depth , as for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , a systematic study of a large set of nuclei and of excited states has not been presented , and the availability of many precise experimental data has not been fully exploited .",
    "we present here results of such a systematic study , which indicate that there are general requirements that the nn effective interaction has to fulfill , in order to provide a reasonable description of the low - lying magnetic excitations .",
    "we have obtained these results by using a phenomenological approach to the rpa theory inspired to the landau - migdal theory of finite fermi systems @xcite . in this approach the mean - field ( mf ) basis , which provides the set of single particle energies and wave functions to be used in the rpa calculations ,",
    "is generated by a woods - saxon well , whose parameters are adjusted to reproduce at best some ground state properties of the nucleus , such as the charge density distribution and the single particle energies around the fermi surface .",
    "in addition , a phenomenological residual nn effective interaction is used .",
    "the parameters of this interaction are chosen to reproduce the energy of some specific excited states . in terms of comparison with the experimental data",
    ", this phenomenological approach uses the rpa theory at its best .    in order to study the sensitivity of our results to the details of the residual interaction ,",
    "we have developed four phenomenological interactions , two of them having zero - range , as in the original formulation of the landau - midgal theory , and the other two having finite - range .",
    "for each type of interaction we have considered a parametrization which includes tensor terms and another one without them , and we have used these interactions to study the excitation of the low - lying magnetic spectra of @xmath0c , @xmath1o , @xmath2ca , @xmath3ca and @xmath4pb nuclei .",
    "we have found only few cases that are sensitive to the differences between the various interactions , and we present them in the paper .",
    "the main result of our study is , however , that most of the states are equally well described by all the interactions we have considered .",
    "this suggests that we have been able to include some general features of the interaction , which are necessary for the description of the magnetic excitation spectra of doubly - closed - shell nuclei .    in order to test this hypothesis",
    "we have then repeated our rpa calculations within a fully self - consistent approach .",
    "this means that the mf states and energies are obtained within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , using the same nn effective interaction employed in the rpa calculations .",
    "in particular we have used the gogny d1 finite - range interaction @xcite . in this case",
    "we have found remarkable disagreement with the experimental data , the most striking result being that all the energies of the states which form an isospin doublet are inverted .",
    "this indicates that the good results obtained with the phenomenological approach are not accidental , and that the study of the magnetic spectra is selective in choosing the strength of the relevant terms of the force .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [",
    "sec : details ] we give some detail of our calculations , mainly regarding the input used to solve the rpa equations .",
    "the results of our phenomenological study of several magnetic states for all the nuclei under investigation are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] we give the results of the self - consistent calculation using the gogny d1 interaction , for some selected cases . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the first input required by the rpa calculation is the set of single particle wave functions and energies . in the phenomenological calculations we have used the single particle bases generated by woods - saxon wells .",
    "the parameters of the wells have been taken from the literature @xcite , and have been chosen to describe at best the energies of the single particle states around the fermi surface and the ground state charge density distributions . in the self - consistent calculations ,",
    "the single particle wave functions and energies have been obtained by solving the hartree - fock equations with the method described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have solved the rpa equations by using a discrete set of single particle wave functions and energies . in the phenomenological calculations ,",
    "the discretization of the continuum has been obtained by diagonalizing the woods - saxon well in a harmonic oscillator basis . in the self - consistent calculations",
    "the discretization has been obtained by imposing the correct boundary conditions of a bound state to the single particle wave functions at the edge of the computing box .",
    "the global rpa solutions strongly depend on the size of the single particle configuration space @xcite . however , there are excited states dominated by particle - hole excitations where the particle wave function is bound . in this article",
    "we consider only this type of states .    for each nucleus considered ,",
    "we have used single particle configuration spaces large enough to ensure the stability of the results for the states under investigation . in the phenomenological calculation the smallest configuration space , used for @xmath0c , is composed of 5 major harmonic oscillator shells , for a total of 44 single particle states .",
    "the largest space has been used for @xmath4pb , and it is composed by 9 major shells for protons and 10 major shells for neutrons , for a total of 100 single particle states . in the self - consistent calculations",
    "we have fixed the size of the computational box , @xmath5 , and the maximum energy of the particle states in the configuration space , @xmath6 . in the case of @xmath0c , @xmath7  fm and @xmath8  mev , while for @xmath4pb these two parameters are 14  fm and 50  mev , respectively .",
    "the second input required by rpa is the residual interaction , which , in analogy to the microscopic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions of urbana or argonne type , we write as v_eff(1,2)&= & v_1(r_12 ) + v_1^(r_12 ) ^(r_1,r_2 ) + & & + 1t2 + & & + v_3(r_12 ) 1s2 + v_4(r_12 ) 1s2 1t2 + & & + v_5(r_12 ) s_12(_12 ) + v_6(r_12 ) s_12(_12 ) 1t2 .",
    "[ eq : intr ] here , following the indications of past phenomenological @xcite and self - consistent @xcite rpa studies , we have included a possible dependence on the nuclear one - body density @xmath9 in the central and isospin channels . in eq .",

    "[ eq : vdens2 ] the @xmath14 functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intr ] ) are the same for all nuclei under investigation .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath15 corresponding to the density dependent part of the interaction are assumed to be different for each nucleus : they have been chosen to reproduce the first @xmath16 state in @xmath0c and the first @xmath17 state in @xmath1o , @xmath2ca , and @xmath4pb .",
    "the other terms of the force have been chosen to get a reasonable description of the centroid energy of the isovector giant dipole resonance by caring that the isoscalar spurious @xmath18 excitation is at zero energy or below .",
    "these criteria are useful for the scalar and isospin terms of the interaction , the main responsible for the excitation of natural parity states .",
    "the @xmath14 functions of the spin , spin - isospin and tensor channels of the interaction ( @xmath193,4,5 and 6 ) have been adjusted to describe the excitation energies of the magnetic states below 8 mev in @xmath4pb , paying particular attention to the @xmath20 states at @xmath21 and @xmath22 mev @xcite , and to the @xmath23 states at @xmath24 and @xmath25 mev @xcite . in addition , we have also cared that the correct sequence of the two 1@xmath26 states in @xmath0c forming an isospin doublet @xcite is obtained , and that the energy of the first @xmath27 state of @xmath1o @xcite is reasonably reproduced . in this work",
    "we are interested in the possible effects of the tensor channels of the interaction as well as in the relevance of its range ( zero or finite ) .",
    "thus , we have built four interactions . in connection with previous rpa studies",

    "for @xmath3ca , we have used the same values as for @xmath2ca .",
    "in all the calculations within the phenomenological approach we have used @xmath38=1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intr ] ) .    in our phenomenological rpa approach",
    "we have considered only the contribution of direct matrix elements , assuming that the effects of the exchange terms are effectively included in the choice of the parameters of the various interactions . therefore the scalar and isospin terms , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , do not contribute to the excitation of unnatural parity states , which are the focus of this work . for sake of completeness , however , we present here the full effective interactions .    we have also considered two finite - range interactions with and without the tensor terms , which we have labeled frtt and fr , respectively .",
    "they are obtained from the argonne v18 potential @xcite , by modifying its short range behavior to take into account short range correlations effects .",
    "in particular , the short range part of the argonne v18 nn potential is removed and replaced by a combination of gaussian functions .",

( [ eq : fr14 ] ) @xmath42 is the number of gaussians used in each channel . for the scalar channel we have included two gaussians in order to obtain an attractive behavior starting from the repulsive core",

    "the lm and fr interactions are not shown , since they are identical , in the central channels , to the lmtt and frtt interactions . the zero - range interaction terms are constant in momentum space .",
    "we point out that the spin term @xmath59 has been set to zero in the fr and frtt interactions , and that lmtt does not have the pure tensor term @xmath60 .",

    "born approximation description of inelastic electron scattering experiments , these responses , which depend on the modulus of the momentum transfer @xmath70 , are related to the cross section by multiplicative factors depending on kinematics variables , and to the mott cross section @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in magnetic states , the charge operator does not contribute .",
    "the operators we have used to calculate the transition amplitudes ( [ eq : transs1 ] ) are those of the convection and magnetization currents .",

    "we have not considered the contribution of meson - exchange currents , which , for low - lying excited states , has been found to be negligible in comparison with the effects of the residual interaction @xcite .",
    "in this section we present our results for the low - lying magnetic states of @xmath0c , @xmath1o , @xmath2ca , @xmath3ca and @xmath4pb , obtained within the phenomenological approach . for each nucleus",
    "we first present the unnatural parity low energy spectrum , we compare it with the measured spectrum , and we discuss the sensitivity of the excitation energies to the inclusion of finite - range and tensor terms contributions in the residual interaction . then , for some specific states , we investigate the electromagnetic transverse response functions . in order to minimize the uncertainties due to the discretization of the continuum , we have selected excited states which are dominated by particle - hole ( ph ) pairs where the particle is in a bound state .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen the states which exhibit the largest sensitivity to those terms of the residual interaction which are the focus of the present study .",
    "also , we have addressed our attention to those states forming isospin doublets , because their structure ( order of the states and relative splitting ) is sensitive to the isospin dependent terms of the residual interactions and , more specifically , to the tensor - isospin terms we have introduced in the previous section .",
    "the interest in isospin doublets will become clearer in connection to the self - consistent calculations which will be presented in next section .",
    "in addition , we give preference to the study of those states for which experimental data are available .",
    "a detailed discussion of the results will be presented throughout this section , but we would like to anticipate that we have obtained a general good description of the excitation spectra , almost independently of the effective interaction used .",
    "this indicates that we have been able to incorporate in the parametrization of the residual interaction some relevant features required by the description of the magnetic excitations .",
    "the disagreement with the experimental data can be due to the use of the plane wave born approximation in the calculation of the electron scattering cross section , or in the nuclear structure part , to the truncation of the configuration space .",
    "actually these approximations are rather well controlled .",
    "the experimental responses are usually presented after a correction for the coulomb distortion of the electron wave functions , and the effects of the limited configuration space are effectively considered by the choice of the force parameters . for these reason we think that the possible discrepancies between our predictions and the experimental data have to be ascribed more to the intrinsic limitations of the rpa theory rather than to a more efficient parametrization of the interaction .      in table [ tab : exc12 ] we compare the energies of the low - lying magnetic states of @xmath0c with the experimental values taken from ref . @xcite . in the calculation with the lm interaction we have been unable to identify the second 2@xmath71 state , because all the states higher than the first one have dominant ph components with the particle in the continuum .",
    "apart from this case we notice that the calculated energies for each state are rather similar , independently on the interaction used .",
