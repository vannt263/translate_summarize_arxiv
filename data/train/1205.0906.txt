    "magnetostriction describes the deformation of a ferro- or ferrimagnetic material during a magnetization process.@xcite thereby , one can distinguish between the _ spontaneous volume magnetostriction _ , which is independent of the magnetic field direction , and the so - called _ linear magnetostriction _ which characterizes the change of length along a certain direction that depends on the orientation of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the same magnetoelastic interaction that causes magnetostriction also leads to changes in the magnetic anisotropy as function of an externally applied strain .",
    "magnetostrictive materials are very important for applications as magnetic field sensors and magneto - mechanical actuators , where a large ( and often also preferably linear ) magnetic field response is essential.@xcite on the other hand magnetostriction also causes noise and frictional losses in magnetic transformer cores , so that in this context a minimization of magnetostriction is desirable .",

    "is also a very attractive candidate for spintronics applications , in particular for spin - filtering tunnel barriers.@xcite for many of these applications , thin films of cfo and nfo are epitaxially grown on substrates with different lattice constants .",
    "the resulting substrate - induced strain can then lead to distinctly different properties of the thin films compared to the corresponding bulk materials .    in view of this , a good quantitative understanding of magnetoelastic properties of spinel ferrites , that provides a solid basis for the interpretation of experimental results and allows for further optimization of magnetostrictive properties , is highly desirable .",
    "in particular , the ability to accurately predict effects of cation off - stoichiometry or surface and interface effects can provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms determining the observed properties .",
    "in previous work we have shown that first - principles calculations based on density - functional theory ( dft ) provide a suitable description of the magnetoelastic properties of spinel ferrites,@xcite thus demonstrating the feasibility of more detailed studies into strain - induced effects in thin film structures composed of cfo and nfo . here",
    "we extend our previous study , in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of the magnetoelastic response of cfo and nfo , in particular including first - principles calculations of the complete set of cubic magnetoelastic and magnetostrictive coefficients .",
    "most importantly , we investigate the influence of different possible cation distributions on the spinel @xmath3 site sublattice on the magnetoelastic response of these materials . the purpose of the present work is to provide a first - principles based description of magnetoelastic coupling in spinel ferrites that can be used as basis for further studies of the effect of cation substitution or off - stoichiometry on the magnetostrictive properties of this important class of materials .",

    ", one can notice that the largest magnetostriction occurs for cases where the cation species are arranged in alternating planes parallel to the applied strain plane , e.g. , @xmath141 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ figspinelcationdistribution ] ) . furthermore , if one compares the two different strain orientations for @xmath19 symmetry , the magnetostriction is larger for @xmath142 , where the strain plane contains chains of @xmath3 site cations with two equal cations next to each other in each chain .",
    "the magnetostriction value for the strain plane containing alternating cation chains within @xmath53 symmetry is the smallest observed here .",
    "however , at present it is unclear whether these correlations between cation arrangement and @xmath50 are mostly coincidental , or whether they indeed indicate a deeper relationship between these two properties . in any case",
    "our results give clear evidence that a fully quantitative model of anisotropy and magnetostriction in cfo needs to include crystal- or ligand - field effects that go beyond the immediate nearest neighbor shell of the co@xmath8 cation .",
    "the effect of different distributions of co@xmath8 and fe@xmath9 cations on the @xmath3 sites surrounding a specific co @xmath3 site has been taken into account in the theory of magnetic anisotropy for cfo by tachiki,@xcite and is also discussed by slonczewski.@xcite it was shown that the corresponding crystal - field component can have a strong effect on the resulting cubic magnetic anisotropy constants .",
    "the noticeable dependence of our calculated magnetoelastic coupling constants on the specific cation arrangement in cfo indicates that this crystal - field component is indeed quite strong and needs to be taken into account within a quantitative theory of anisotropy and magnetostriction in spinel ferrites .",
    "in summary , we have presented a detailed first - principles study of elastic and magnetoelastic properties of the inverse spinel ferrites nfo and cfo .",
    "we have calculated all cubic elastic and magnetoelastic constants from a variety of distorted crystal structures .",
    "thereby , we have considered different possible cation arrangements to represent the inverse spinel structure , and in the case of cfo we also considered a cation distribution corresponding to incomplete inversion with @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetoelastic coefficients are obtained from the strain dependence of the maes for two different deformations of the crystal structure .    even though the symmetry of the considered cation arrangements is lower than cubic ,",
    "our results show that the elastic response of both nfo and cfo can to a good approximation be described using cubic elastic constants .",
    "since the elastic constants are mainly determined by the strength of the chemical bonding , this indicates that co , ni , and fe all form bonds of similar strength with the surrounding atoms .",
    "similarly , the magnetoelastic response of nfo can also to a good approximation be described using the cubic expression for the magnetoelastic energy density ( eq .  ) .",
    "this is indicated by the relatively small quantitative differences in the calculated magnetoelastic coefficients for the various cation arrangements . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetoelastic coefficients of cfo show a stronger dependence on the specific cation arrangement and the orientation of the applied strain , so that the cubic approximations is less justified in that case . in addition , the overall magnetoelastic response is much stronger in cfo than in nfo .",
    "both of these observations can be understood from the @xmath152 electron configuration of the co@xmath8 cation , which leads to stronger spin - orbit effects compared with the @xmath153 configuration of ni@xmath8 . in the latter , the orbital magnetic moment",
    "is strongly quenched by the dominant octahedral component of the crystal - field , and the system is less sensitive to additional crystal field components of lower symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the orbital moment is not fully quenched by the octahedral crystal field for the @xmath152 configuration of co@xmath8 , and additional splittings , which are created by the different arrangements of the surrounding @xmath3 site cations , can have much stronger effects on the electronic ground state within the partially filled minority - spin @xmath154 orbital manifold .",
    "both sign and magnitude of the calculated magnetostriction constants agree well with available experimental data . even for cfo ,",
    "where the calculated magnetostriction depends more strongly on the specific cation distribution than for nfo , the resulting uncertainty is within the spread of available experimental data .",
    "further experimental data for single crystals is therefore required for a more accurate comparison .",
    "we note that a number of obstacles can in principle affect an accurate comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "apart from potential influences of varying sample stoichiometry , degree of inversion , and measuring temperature , the preparation of an ideal demagnetized state with an essentially random orientation of magnetic domains is relatively hard to achieve .",
    "for example , a state with 50  % of domains oriented parallel and 50  % of domains oriented antiparallel with respect to a certain axis would have zero magnetization but the magnetostrictive strain would already be saturated along that direction . furthermore , for systems with very strong magnetic anisotropy , such as e.g. cfo , it can be very difficult to achieve full saturation along the hard direction.@xcite other sources of disagreement between theory and experiment could be due to the neglect of higher order terms in the energy expression , @xcite or most likely due to deficiencies in the exchange correlation potential used in the dft calculations . however , based on the currently available experimental data it can be concluded that the gga+@xmath2 method used in the present work is sufficiently accurate for further investigation on the effects of cation distribution , degree of inversion , and stoichiometry on the magnetostrictive properties of spinel ferrites .",
    "our work thus provides a sound basis for future investigations of magnetostriction and anisotropy in spinel ferrites as well as for future first principles studies of magnetoelectric coupling in artificial multiferroic heterostructures containing either cfo or nfo in combination with ferroelectric and/or piezoelectric materials .",
    "this work was done mostly within the school of physics at trinity college dublin , supported by science foundation ireland under ref .",
    "sfi-07/yi2/i1051 and made use of computational facilities provided by the trinity centre for high performance computing ( tchpc ) and the irish centre for high - end computing ( ichec ) ."
