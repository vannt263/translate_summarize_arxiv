    "in recent years various realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials have been developed , such as the argonne  v18 potential @xcite , the cd  bonn potential @xcite and the so called chiral potentials @xcite .",
    "they all succeed in describing the experimental two - nucleon data with the same precision but differ in their off - shell behaviour , which manifests itself for example in different three - body forces needed for ab initio calculations of nuclei .",
    "furthermore , various transformation techniques , like the renormalization group @xmath0 @xcite , the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) @xcite and the similarity renormalization group approach ( srg ) @xcite , have been applied to derive effective interactions for nuclear ab initio calculations .",
    "most of these effective realistic interactions are formulated in matrix element representation , which restricts their use to many - body treatments based on a pre - determined basis representation , such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite .",
    "thus , these interactions are not usable for many - body methods that require an explicit operator representation of the nn potential , such as fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite or antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite .",
    "we present a method which allows to derive an approximate operator representation starting from the partial wave matrix elements of the interaction . for that purpose an ansatz for the operator representation",
    "is chosen .",
    "the unknown parameters in the ansatz are obtained from a fit to the partial wave matrix elements of the potential one aims to describe .",
    "the operators used in the ansatz will depend on the interaction under investigation .",
    "the main reason for that is the momentum - dependence of the interaction .",
    "for example , the ucom interactions based on local potentials have a momentum dependence that is polynomial in the momenta whereas srg interactions have a more complicated momentum dependence . in this work",
    "we consider the ucom transformed argonne potential .",
    "its exact matrix elements in momentum space as well as its operator representation ( in a controlled approximation ) are available .",
    "the existing operator representation is very complex , but with the procedure presented in this paper , a simplified operator representation can be obtained . whereas the full operator representation provides essentially exact matrix elements for all momenta and all partial waves , we `` only '' require our simplified operator representation to reproduce the exact matrix elements with high - precision for low momenta and in the lowest partial waves that are relevant for the description of light nuclei . in the ansatz for the operator representation we therefore use an optimized set of operators which is a subset of the operators of the exact ucom potential .",
    "but not only the operator structure is simplified , also the radial dependencies of the interaction components are simplified in the sense that the low momentum matrix elements are not sensitive to variations on a short length scale .",
    "this is similar to the idea of coarse - grained potentials @xcite .",
    "the simplified operator representation also provides some better understanding about the importance of individual terms in the effective interaction , especially with respect to its momentum dependence .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ucom ] the concept of ucom and the operator representation and the partial wave matrix elements of the ucom transformed argonne potential are presented .",
    "[ sec : op ] focuses on the construction of an operator representation from the partial wave matrix elements of the interaction .",
    "we discuss the choice of a reduced set of operators to accurately describe the ucom transformed argonne potential for low angular momenta . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twofewsystems ] we show results of calculations for two- and few - nucleon systems to demonstrate that the operator representation with the reduced set of operators indeed leads to the same results as the exact , but more complex , ucom transformed argonne potential .",
    "the concept of the unitary correlation operator method @xcite is to imprint the short - range central and tensor correlations induced by the nuclear interaction @xcite on `` simple '' many - body states @xmath1 , such as slater determinants .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath2 describes the transformation between the many - body state @xmath1 , which possibly contains long - range but no short - range central and tensor correlations , and the state @xmath3 that contains all correlations :    @xmath4    to calculate the matrix element @xmath5 of an operator @xmath6 one can either work with the bare operator @xmath6 and correlated states @xmath3 or use a correlated operator    @xmath7    and uncorrelated states @xmath1 instead :    @xmath8    both methods are equivalent , but it is generally more convenient to work with uncorrelated simple states and the correlated operators .    the correlation operator @xmath2 is decomposed into the unitary operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 describing the tensor and radial correlations , respectively : @xmath11 the following ansatz with hermitian two - body generators @xmath12 and @xmath13 is used : @xmath14 the form of these generators reflects the structure of the central and tensor correlations .",
    "the short - range repulsion of the nn interaction prevents the nucleons from approaching each other closer than the extent of the repulsive core .",
    "that means the two - body density at short relative distances will be strongly suppressed in the correlated many - body state .",
    "this effect can be achieved by a distance - dependent shift of the radial wave function . using the projection of the relative momentum @xmath15 on the relative distance vector @xmath16 in the two - body subsystem , @xmath17 , \\label{eq : radmomentum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the shift function @xmath18 which describes the amplitude of the radial shift for each spin - isospin channel",

    "the tensor force induces correlations between the orientation of the total spin and that of the relative distance vector @xmath23 of a pair of nucleons .",

    "is the same , the presented method to derive the operator representation from the matrix elements of the interaction can be used for ucom(var ) potentials as well .",
