    "positronium ( ps ) , the electron - positron bound state , is a purely leptonic system . the energy difference between @xmath2-positronium ( @xmath3-ps , @xmath4 state ) and @xmath5-positronium ( @xmath6-ps , @xmath7 state)-ps decays mainly into two photons with lifetime of 125  ps , it takes 142  ns for @xmath3-ps to decay .",
    "this is because @xmath3-ps can only decay into three photons which is strongly suppressed by invariant matrix and kinematics",
    ". two photon decay of @xmath3-ps is forbidden by c conservation . ]",
    "is called hyperfine splitting of positronium ( ps - hfs ) .",
    "it is a good target to study bound state qed precisely .",
    "the ps - hfs value is approximately 203  ghz ( 0.84  mev ) , which is significantly larger than hydrogen hfs ( 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "about one third of this large value is contributed by a quantum oscillation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : osci ] : @xmath3-ps @xmath8 @xmath3-ps - ps has the same quantum number as a photon . ] . since some hypothetical particles , such as a milicharged particle , can participate in the quantum oscillation to shift ps - hfs value , its precise measurement provides a probe into new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "measurements of the ps - hfs have been performed in 70 s and 80 s  @xcite .",
    "the results were consistent with each other , and combined precision of 3.3  ppm is obtained .",
    "they were consistent with @xmath9 calculation of the qed available at that time .",

    "the new prediction is @xmath10203.391  69(41 )  ghz , where the uncertainty is the unknown nonlogarithmic @xmath11 term estimated in an analogous way to the hfs of muonium .",
    "this calculated value differs from the measured value of @xmath12203.388  65(67 )  ghz by 3.9@xmath0 as shown in fig .",

    "a static magnetic field makes zeeman mixing between @xmath13 spin state of @xmath3-ps and @xmath6-ps . as a result ,",
    "the energy level of @xmath13 state of @xmath3-ps becomes higher than @xmath14 state .",
    "this zeeman splitting , which is approximately proportional to ps - hfs , is a few ghz frequency under about 1  tesla magnetic field .",
    "static magnetic field is applied in rf cavities where positronium is produced .",
    "zeeman transition from @xmath3-ps of @xmath15 to @xmath3-ps of @xmath13 has been observed .",
    "we point out the following three possibilities as the common systematic errors in these indirect measurements .    1",
    ".   they may underestimate the non - uniformity of the magnetic field .",
    "2 .   the unthermalized @xmath3-ps contribution can result in an underestimation of the material effect .",
    "rf systems to cause the transition might not be sufficiently stable .",
    "direct measurement of ps - hfs without any magnetic fields is a main topic .",
    "i show the status of a prototype experiment in section 3 .",

    "positrons emitted from a @xmath16 source are polarized in the direction of their momentum due to parity violation in the weak interaction .",
    "consequently , the resulting @xmath3-ps is also highly polarized .",
    "this @xmath3-ps is a superimposed state of above two energy eigenstates of @xmath3-ps in a static magnetic field .",
    "when a perpendicular magnetic field of about 0.1  t is induced to the polarization axis of this @xmath3-ps , this quantum oscillation can be detected as an observable _ oscillation _ in timing spectra of @xmath3-ps decay .",
    "this approach is quite different from the previous all experiments .",
    "it is free from systematic errors originating from the high power light source and the rf cavity with high q - value . instead of them ,",
    "precise measuring technique of decay curve is crucial . especially , time - to - digital converter  ( tdc ) with high performance is essential for precise measurement of the timing spectrum . therefore , these two different approaches are complementary",

    "a frequency tunable radiational source is necessary to measure a whole shape of the resonance curve .",

    "the electrons are emitted from the dc electron gun , concentrated and rotated as cyclotron motion in the superconducting magnet .",

    "the electrons stimulate cyclotron resonance maser in the cavity .",
    "the produced coherent photons are guided to the output port through the window , while electrons are dumped at a collector .",
    "we developed a gyrotron operating at @xmath36 ghz with @xmath37  tesla , @xmath38 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ gypicture ] .",

    "it is narrow enough to control the resonance at the fabry - prot cavity .",
    "measured result with a similar gyrotron shows the frequency width is less than 10 khz  @xcite .",
    "although the frequency can be tuned by changing the @xmath20 factor with different acceleration of electrons , the tuning range is limited by the resonant width of the cavity to several hundreds of megahertz .",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] shows the power profile of the radiation at taken with an infrared ( ir ) camera .",
    "the profile has a circular polarization called te03 mode .",
    "unfortunately , the mode inside fabry - prot cavity is a linearly polarized _",
    "gaussian mode_. therefore , the original gyrotron output can not couple with fabry - prot cavity .",
    "that s why a mode conversion is necessary to use gyrotron power efficiently .",
    "transportation system is composed of three parabolic mirrors called m0 , m1 and m2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] .",
    "the first parabolic mirror m0 converts polarization from circular to linear .",
    "m1 and m2 simply change the shape of power distribution from bi - gaussian to gaussian .",
    "then , plain mirror m3 reflects radiaion and introduces it into fabry - prot cavity .",
    "the power distribution is successfully converted into gaussian - like mode .",
    "coupling between input light and fabry - prot cavity is now about 60% .",
    "however , the transformation efficiency is 30% , because the output of the current gyrotron is not optimized . as a result ,",
    "about 20% of the original radiation from gyrotron can resonate in the cavity .",
    "photons produced at the gyrotron are transported and accumulated in a cavity .",
    "since 203  ghz photons can be treated optically at the centimeter or larger size scale , we use a fabry - prot cavity , which consists of two opposing mirrors to confine photons between them .",
    "unlike rf cavities , the confinement in the fabry - prot cavity is 1-dimensional while the other four sides are open as shown in fig.[fabryphoto ] .",
    "a golden mesh mirror is used on the input side of the cavity to introduce photons from gyrotron .",
    "a copper concave mirror is used on the other side .",
    "the two most important characteristics of a cavity are _ finesse _ @xmath39 and _ input coupling _ c. with the reflectivity of mesh mirror @xmath40 and concave mirror @xmath41 , finesse is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the medium loss inside the cavity .",
    "round - trip times @xmath44 of photon in the cavity is given by @xmath45 therefore finesse characterizes the capability of the cavity to store photons inside . to maximize the @xmath39 ,",
    "power losses must be minimized .",
    "there are 3 types of loss , diffraction loss , medium loss and ohmic loss . with the confinement of photons by the concave mirror ,",
    "diffraction loss is negligible in our cavity .",
    "medium loss in gas is measured as about 0.1% .",
    "ohmic loss occurs at the mirrors , which is around 0.15% at the copper mirror and less than 1.0% at the mesh mirror .",
    "input coupling is the fraction of input power matched to the cavity mode .",
    "it is an important parameter to efficiently introduce photons into the cavity . in our cavity ,",
    "the input coupling is determined by transmittance of the input mesh mirror .",
    "cc    figure [ fabryphoto ] shows the test setup , which is comprised of a mesh mirror on the mirror mount and a concave mirror on a piezo stage .",
    "transmitted power is measured through a small hole on the concave mirror . on the other hand ,",
    "reflected power is measured outside of the mesh mirror .",
