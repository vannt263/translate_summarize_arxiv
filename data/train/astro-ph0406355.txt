    "a wealth of observational evidence indicates the existence of considerably more mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies than we see in stars and gas .",
    "the source of the missing mass has been a problem since zwicky s 1937 measurement of the masses of extragalactic systems @xcite . given the evidence from galaxy clusters , galaxy dynamics and structure formation , big - bang nucleosynthesis , and the cosmic microwave background that baryons can only account for @xmath2 of this matter , most of it must be nonbaryonic . although neutrinos provide the cosmological density of dark matter if their masses sum to @xmath3 ev , such particles can not ( essentially from the pauli principle ) have a sufficiently high phase - space density to account for galactic dark - matter halos @xcite ; moreover , such masses are now inconsistent with neutrino - mass measurements @xcite .",
    "theorists have thus taken to considering for dark - matter candidates new physics beyond the standard model . to date , the most promising candidates  those that appear in fairly minimal extensions of the standard model and which coincidentally have a cosmological density near the critical density  are a weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , such as the neutralino , the supersymmetric partner of the photon , @xmath4 boson , and/or higgs boson @xcite , or the axion @xcite .",
    "a considerable theoretical literature on the properties and phenomenology of these particles has arisen , and there are considerable ongoing experimental efforts to detect these particles .    in the absence of discovery of such particles , it may be well worth exploring other possibilities .",
    "thus , an alternative line of investigation takes a more model - independent approach and seeks to explore phenomenologically the possible properties of a dark - matter particle .",
    "along these lines , for example , constraints to strongly - interacting dark matter were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; self - interacting dark matter has been considered @xcite , and some have studied whether dark matter might be charged @xcite or have a millicharge @xcite .",
    "our investigation follows in spirit the latter possibility .",
    "in particular , dark matter is so called because the coupling to photons is assumed to be nonexistent or very weak , or else we would have presumably seen such particles either through absorption or emission of radiation or in laboratory experiments . in this paper , we ask the question , `` how dark is ` dark ' ? '' in other words , how weak must the coupling of the dark - matter particle to the photon be in order to be consistent with laboratory and astrophysical constraints ? in the work on millicharged particles , a dark - matter coupling to photons was assumed to arise from a tiny charge .    in this paper",
    "we consider the possibility that the dark matter possesses an electric or magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the punch line , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : concord ] , is that a dirac particle with an electric or magnetic dipole moment of order @xmath5 cm with a mass between an mev and a few gev can provide the dark matter while satisfying all experimental and observational constraints .",
    "cm , where @xmath6 is the electron charge . for reference ,",
    "the bohr magneton @xmath7  cm in these units .",
    "also note that we work in rationalized gaussian units so that the fine - structure constant @xmath8 , and in particle - physics units ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ]    in the following section , we introduce the effective lagrangian for the dipolar dark matter ( ddm ) interaction with photons .",
    "we discuss the relic abundance in section [ section3 ] .",
    "section [ section4 ] presents constraints on dark - matter dipole moments and masses that arise from direct searches at low - background detectors as well as constraints from high - altitude experiments .",
    "section [ section5 ] discusses constraints due to precision tests of the standard model , while section [ section6 ] discusses constraints due to the cosmic microwave background and the growth of large - scale structure .",
    "we provide some concluding remarks in section [ section7 ] .",
    "an appendix provides details of the calculation of the drag force between the baryon and ddm fluids used in section [ section6 ] .",
    "a particle with a permanent electric and/or magnetic dipole moment must have a nonzero spin ; we thus consider spin-1/2 particles .",
    "moreover , majorana particles can not have permanent dipole moments , so we consider dirac fermions .",
    "since the spin and the magnetic dipole are both axial vectors , a magnetic dipole moment can arise without violating any discrete symmetries .",
    "however , the electric dipole moment is a vector and thus requires time - reversal and parity violation .    the effective lagrangian for coupling of a dirac fermion @xmath12 with a magnetic dipole moment @xmath13 and an electric dipole moment @xmath14 to the electromagnetic field @xmath15 is @xmath16 at energies low compared to the dark - matter mass , the photon is blind to distinctions between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( unless time - reversal - violating observables are considered ) .",
    "hence , we can discuss limits to @xmath14 which equally apply to @xmath13 , except where noted .    on dimensional grounds",
    ", we expect the electric dipole moment to be @xmath17  cm , where @xmath18 is the proton mass .",
    "similar arguments also apply to the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "this limit is shown as the perturbative bound in fig .",
    "[ fig : concord ] , as violation of this bound would signal some non - trivial or non - perturbative field configuration . as we will see below , more rigorous but slightly weaker upper limits can be set with unitarity arguments .",
    "these upper limits already simplify our analysis .",
    "the phenomenology of charged dark - matter particles is determined largely by the ability of these particles to form atom - like bound states with electrons , protons , or each other .",
    "however , dipolar dark matter can not form such bound states .",
    "a neutral particle with a magnetic moment will not form bound states with charged particles . curiously enough , a neutral particle with an electric dipole moment ( edm ) can indeed form a bound state with an electron , as first noted by no less than fermi and teller @xcite , but only if the dipole moment is greater than @xmath19  cm ( assuming @xmath20 ) where @xmath21 is the bohr radius . for smaller values of the dipole , the electron `` sees '' both poles of the dipole and finds no stable orbit .",
    "this critical electric dipole moment scales inversely with the dipole - electron reduced mass , so a bound state with a proton can occur if the dipole mass is @xmath22 and @xmath23  cm . as we will see below , such values for",
    "the edm can not occur for a pointlike ddm .",
    "likewise , the weakness of the dipole - dipole interaction prevents the formation of any stable dark - matter atoms .",
    "the first cosmological constraint is that from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "bbn requires that the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath24  mev does not exceed the equivalent of roughly 0.2 neutrino species @xcite .",
    "since the particles we are considering are dirac particles , they act like two effective neutrino species and thus can not be relativistic and in equilibrium at bbn .",
    "generally , such considerations rule out @xmath25  mev , and so we restrict our attention in fig .",
    "[ fig : concord ] to masses above an mev . strictly speaking ,",

    ", fermions are the dominant final state .",
    "the present - day mass density of ddm particles thus depends primarily on the dipole moment . if such particles are to account for the dark matter , then @xmath50 @xcite , and @xmath51  cm for @xmath52gev .",
    "the full mass dependence of this result is shown in fig .",

    ", the total @xmath36-wave annihilation cross section must be @xmath53 @xcite , so that @xmath54 , fixed by the cross section for annihilation to two photons .",
    "this limit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : concord ] , as is the more stringent , but less rigorous , limit @xmath55 .    of course",
    ", the present - day mass density of ddm particles could differ from the estimates obtained above . to obtain these results , we assumed ( 1 ) that the dipole interaction with photons is the only interaction of these particles ; and ( 2 ) that there is no particle - antiparticle asymmetry .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in any realistic model , a dark - matter dipole interaction will arise from loop diagrams involving other standard - model and new particles .",
    "if so , then there may be other contributions to the annihilation cross sections . in this case",
    ", the relic abundance will be smaller than we have estimated above .",
    "we thus conclude that if there is no particle - antiparticle asymmetry , our estimates should be treated as an upper bound to the relic abundance , and the @xmath56 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : concord ] should thus be considered an upper limit to the desired values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relic abundance could also be increased if exotic processes increase the expansion rate during freezeout @xcite .",
    "if there is an asymmetry between @xmath12 and @xmath57 , then the relic abundance is increased relative to our estimate . in this case , however , the present - day universe should contain predominantly either particles or antiparticles .",
    "although there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect there to be a particle - antiparticle asymmetry , the observed baryon - antibaryon asymmetry might lead us to expect an analogous dark - matter asymmetry , should the dark matter be composed of dirac particles . it is possible such asymmetries have a common origin .",
    "finally , we have assumed above that the particles freeze out when they are nonrelativistic .",
    "however , as the dipole moment is lowered for a given mass , freezeout occurs earlier .",
    "if the dipole moment is reduced beyond a certain value , and if there are no other couplings to standard - model particles , then freezeout will be relativistic .",
    "these particles will then be roughly as abundant as photons , and they will overclose the universe by huge margins unless their masses are @xmath27  few ev ; even in this case they will violate constraints to hot dark matter from the cmb and large - scale structure , and they will also be unable , from the tremaine - gunn argument , to make up the dark matter in galactic halos .",
    "the transition from nonrelativistic to relativistic freezeout occurs ( again , assuming no non - dipole interactions with standard - model particles ) for @xmath58  gev for @xmath59  mev , and for @xmath60  mev , at @xmath61  mev .",
    "the diagram for scattering of a ddm particle with a particle of charge @xmath62 occurs through the exchange of a photon , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn ] ( not unlike the electron - neutron interaction @xcite ) . in the nonrelativistic limit , the differential cross section for this process is given by , @xmath63 where @xmath33 is the relative velocity .",
    "through this interaction the ddm might produce a signal in a direct - detection experiment .",
    "although the total cross section is formally infinite , the divergence comes from the small - momentum - transfer scatterings that will be screened by atomic electrons . roughly speaking , then , the ddm - nucleus elastic - scattering cross section will be @xmath64  @xmath65 , using @xmath66 .",
    "current null searches in germanium detectors [ @xmath67 correspond for masses @xmath68  gev to a rough upper limit to the cross section @xmath69  @xmath65 @xcite , thus ruling out any dipole moment @xmath70 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : concord ] as the horizontal dashed line at @xmath71  cm .",
    "note that the cross - section limit depends ( and increases ) with mass at higher masses ; the curve appears as a horizontal line simply because of the break in scale on the @xmath72 axis .",
    "this seems like a very stringent limit , especially considering the value , @xmath73 , favored for the correct cosmological density .",
    "however , if the dipole moment becomes large enough , the particles will be slowed in the rock above the detector and thus evade detection in these underground experiments . in order to determine the magnitude of the dipole moment for this to occur , we need to calculate the stopping power @xmath74 for the particle as it passes through the atmosphere and then the rock .",
    "since elastic scattering takes place through exchange of a photon , it leads to a long - range interaction and , as we have seen above , a formally divergent elastic - scattering cross section .",
    "the calculation of the stopping power thus parallels that for ionization loss due to coulomb collisions , with two important differences .",
    "first of all , since the long - range force is @xmath75 , as opposed to @xmath76 for rutherford scattering , stopping occurs via scattering from nuclei , rather than electrons .",
    "second , since this interaction falls more rapidly with radius than the coulomb interaction , the stopping power is due primarily to hard scatters at small impact parameter , rather than soft scatters at a wide range of impact parameters .",
    "our result for the stopping power due to scattering from nuclei of charge @xmath77 is @xmath78 where the kinetic - energy transfer in a single collision is @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the depth , and @xmath81=m_\\chi m_n(m_\\chi+m_n)^{-1}$ ] is the reduced mass . for very weak wimp interactions with nuclei , the most restrictive limits on the wimp - proton cross section ( the smallest upper bounds )",
    "are obtained from null searches from experiments that are deepest underground ( so as to reduce the background ) .",

    "however , the particle only needs to lose enough energy for @xmath84 to drop below the detection threshold for a particular experiment . equating the maximum kinetic energy transferable in a collision ( @xmath86 ) to the threshold detectable nuclear - recoil energy ( @xmath87 )",

    "so far we have assumed that the particle loses energy but is not significantly deflected in each scatter ; this will be a good approximation if @xmath92 .",
    "however , when @xmath93 gev , the dark - matter particle may be backscattered upon encountering a terrestrial nucleus , rather than simply being slowed without deflection . in this case ,",
    "the particle will diffuse , undergoing @xmath94 scatters before coming to rest .",
    "if so , the penetration depth will be reduced by an additional factor of @xmath95 .",
