    "the theoretical analysis of nuclear dynamics by microscopic methods remains undoubtedly a crucial issue of present - day nuclear physics . besides the merely theoretical interest it is stimulated by new experimental opportunities for the study of the nuclear many - body system .",
    "along with new possibilities to investigate more precisely nuclear systems being considered well known , the recent generation of radioactive - beam facilities enables us to examine exotic systems with extreme spin and isospin values . for a successful description of nuclei close to the limits of stability a powerful and reliable theory should be provided .",
    "it should be based on a consistent treatment of both ground and excited states and it should allow for predictions of nuclear properties in areas , which are hard or impossible to access by future experiments .",
    "ab initio calculations and multi - configuration mixing within the shell - model can , so far , only be applied in light nuclei . at present , for a universal description of nuclei all over the periodic table , density functional theory ( dft ) based on the mean - field concept provides a very reasonable concept .",
    "dft has been introduced in the sixties in atomic and molecular physics @xcite and shortly after that in nuclear physics , where it has been called density dependent hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "today it is widely used for all kinds of quantum mechanical many - body systems .",
    "density functional theory can , in principle , provide an exact description of the many - body dynamics , if the exact density functional is known , but for such systems as nuclei one is far from a microscopic derivation and one is forced to determine the functional in a phenomenological way .",
    "starting from basic symmetries the parameters are adjusted to characteristic experimental data in finite nuclei and nuclear matter .",
    "one of the most successful schemes of this type is covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) .",
    "it is based on lorentz invariance connecting in a consistent way the spin and spatial degrees of freedom in the nucleus .",
    "therefore , it needs only a relatively small number of parameters which are adjusted to reproduce a set of bulk properties of spherical closed - shell nuclei @xcite . a large variety of nuclear phenomena",
    "have been described over the years within this kind of model : ground state properties of finite spherical and deformed nuclei all over the periodic table @xcite from light nuclei @xcite to super - heavy elements @xcite , from the neutron drip line , where halo phenomena are observed @xcite , to the proton drip line @xcite with nuclei unstable against the emission of protons @xcite .",
    "rotational bands are treated within the relativistic cranking approximation @xcite and the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) @xcite and quasi - particle rrpa @xcite have been formulated as the small amplitude limit of time - dependent relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models for a description of collective and non - collective excitations .",
    "this method is successful , in particular , for the description of the positions of giant resonances and spin / isospin - excitations as the isobaric analog resonance ( iar ) or the gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) @xcite .",
    "recently it has been also used for a theoretical interpretation of low - lying dipole @xcite and quadrupole @xcite excitations .    with a few exceptions , where the quadrupole motion has been studied within the relativistic generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite , applications of covariant density functional theory to the description of excited states",
    "are limited to relativistic rpa , i.e. to configurations of @xmath4-nature .",
    "none of these methods , however , can be applied to the investigation of the coupling to more complicated configurations , as it occurs for instance in the damping phenomena causing the width of giant resonances .",
    "it is also known , that in such theories , because of the low values of the effective mass , the level density of the single - particle spectrum in the vicinity of the fermi surface is considerably reduced as compared to the experimental data .",
    "based on the fermi liquid theory ( flt ) of landau @xcite the theory of finite fermi systems ( tffs ) of migdal @xcite is another very successful method for the description of low - lying nuclear excitations @xcite , which is known since the fifties .",
    "it has several general properties in common with density functional theory .",
    "first , both theories are know to be exact , at least in principle , but in practice the parameters entering these theories have to be determined in a phenomenological way by adjustment to experimental data .",
    "second , both theories are based in some sense on a single - particle concept .",
    "density functional theory uses the mean field concept with slater determinants in an effective single - particle potential as a vehicle to introduce shell - effects in an exact theory and fermi liquid theory is based on the concept of quasi - particles obeying a dyson equation , which are defined as the basic excitations of the neighboring system with odd particle number .",
    "third , in practical applications both theories describe in the simplest versions the nuclear excitations in the rpa approximation , i.e. by a linear combination of @xmath0-configurations in an average nuclear potential .    however , there are also essential differences between these two concepts .",
    "first , in contrast to dft , tffs does not attempt to calculate the ground state properties of the many - body system , but it describes the nuclear excitations in terms of landau quasi - particles and their interaction",
    ". therefore the experimental data used to fix the phenomenological parameters of the theories are bulk properties of the ground state in the case of density functional theory , and properties of single - particle excitations and of the collective excitations in the case of finite fermi systems theory .",
    "second , in dft the mean field is determined in a self - consistent way and therefore the rpa spectrum contains goldstone modes at zero energy . this is usually not the case in tffs calculations , which are based on a non - relativistic shell - model potential , whose parameters are adjusted to the experimental single - particle spectra .",
    "therefore there is no self - consistency in the rpa calculations of tffs and the goldstone modes do not separate from the other modes .",
    "they are distributed among the low - lying excitations .",
    "third , modern versions of tffs go much beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "using green s function techniques the coupling between quasi - particles and phonons has been investigated .",
    "based on the phonons calculated in the framework of the rpa one has included particle - phonon coupling vertices and an energy dependence of the self - energy in the dyson equation @xcite .",
    "this leads also to an induced interaction in the bethe - salpeter equation caused by the exchange of phonons which also depends on the energy .",
    "the coupling of particles and phonons has also been derived from nuclear field theory ( nft ) and its extensions @xcite .",
    "many aspects of the coupling between the quasi - particles and the collective vibrations have been investigated with these techniques @xcite as well as with other kinds of approaches beyond rpa @xcite over the years .",
    "the present work makes the attempt to find a combination of the basic ideas of density functional theory and landau - migdal theory .",
    "the concept is similar to earlier work in refs .",
    "@xcite , where specific non - relativistic energy functionals have been used to construct self - consistent theory of finite fermi systems .",
    "we start here from a covariant density functional @xmath5 $ ] widely used in the literature .",
    "it is adjusted to ground state properties of characteristic nuclei and , without any additional parameter , it provides the necessary input of finite fermi systems theory , such as the mean field and the single - particle spectrum as well as an effective interaction between the @xmath0-configurations in terms of the second derivative of the same energy @xmath5 $ ] with respect to the density .",
    "thus the phenomenological input of landau - migdal theory is replaced by the results of density functional theory .",
    "the same interaction is used to calculate the vertices for particle - vibration coupling @xcite .",
    "we then apply the techniques of landau - migdal theory and its modern extensions to describe vibrational coupling and complex configurations . in this way",
    "we obtain a fully consistent description of the many - body dynamics .",
    "two essential approximations are used in this context : first , the _ time - blocking approximation _ ( tba ) blocks in a special time - projection technique the @xmath4-propagation through states which have a more complex structure than @xmath6phonon .",
    "the nuclear response can then be explicitly calculated on the @xmath7phonon level by summation of an infinite series of feynman s diagrams .",
    "this approximation has been introduced in ref .",
    "initially it was called method of chronological decoupling of diagrams ( mcdd ) and it is also discussed in recent review articles @xcite .",
    "second , a special _ subtraction technique _",
    "guarantees , that there is no double counting between the additional correlations introduced by particle - vibration coupling and the ground state correlations already taken into account in the phenomenological density functional .",
    "these two tools are essential for the success of the present method .",
    "tba introduces a consistent truncation scheme into the bethe - salpeter equation and without it it would be hard to solve the equations explicitly .",
    "the subtraction method is the essential tool to connect density functional theory so far used only on the level of mean field theory , i.e. on the rpa level , with the extended landau - migdal theory , where complex configurations are included through particle - vibration coupling .    as discussed above",
    "there are several versions of density functional theory in nuclear system . in the present work we use covariant density functional theory with the parameter set nl3 @xcite .",
    "a first attempt in this direction has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we treated the level density problem in the framework of covariant particle - vibration coupling .    in section",
    "ii we discuss shortly the general formalism of covariant density functional theory , we introduce the concept of the energy dependent self - energy @xmath8 and the vertices of particle - vibration coupling in the relativistic framework , and we discuss the response formalism and the time blocking approximation for the response function . in section",
    "iii we show , how to solve the resulting integral equations in detail and present recent numerical applications for the spreading width of the doubly magic nuclei @xmath1pb and @xmath2sn and in section iv we include a brief summary and an outlook for future applications .",
    "appendices a - d provide some more details for the formalism used in the calculations .",
    "in relativistic mean - field theory the nucleus is considered as a system of nucleons interacting by the exchange of effective mesons , which characterize the quantum numbers of the various fields .",
    "conventional rmf theory uses @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11-mesons and the photon as a minimal set of bosons which is necessary to generate realistic nuclear fields @xcite .",
    "this concept is expressed by the following lagrangian density depending on the nucleon spinor @xmath12 as well as on the mesons @xmath9 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the electromagnetic fields @xmath15 : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the bare nucleon mass , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding meson masses , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are field tensors : @xmath23 as usual arrows denote isovectors and boldface symbols will be used for vectors in ordinary space .",

    "( [ lagr ] ) read @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the corresponding coupling constants . for the sake of simplicity , we use in the following discussions the linear version ( [ lagr ] ) of the lagrangian . however , it is well known that one needs an additional density dependence in order to obtain a reliable description of nuclear surface properties .",
    "it is either expressed by a non - linear self - interaction between the mesons or by an explicit density dependence of the coupling constants @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath30 .",
    "in all the numerical applications we use such modifications . they are discussed in detail in appendix  [ nls ] .",
    "the classical variation principle being applied to the lagrangian density ( [ lagr ] ) leads to the following system of coupled equations of motion for the fermions @xmath31 and the mesons : @xmath32 here the index @xmath33 numerates the nucleons and the index @xmath34 runs over the set of meson fields @xmath35 .",

    "it implies the following four approximations :    \\i ) only the motion of the nucleons is quantized , the meson and electromagnetic degrees of freedom are described by _",
    "classical fields_. the nucleons move independently in these classical fields , i.e. residual two - body correlations are disregarded and the many - nucleon wave function is a slater determinant at all times .",
    "\\ii ) in time - dependent applications we use the _ instantaneous approximation _ , i.e. the time derivatives @xmath40 in the klein - gordon equations and consequently the retardation effects for the meson fields are neglected although the dirac spinors @xmath41 as well as the fields @xmath42 are functions of coordinates and time .",
    "this is justified by the relatively large meson masses and the corresponding short range of the meson exchange interaction .",
    "\\iii ) _ fock terms _ are neglected .",
    "because of the short range character of the meson exchange forces they behave similar to zero range forces , where the fock terms have the same form as the direct terms and contribute only in a change of the relevant strength parameters . since our strength parameters are adjusted to experiment , fock terms for the heavy mesons are implicitly taken into account to a large extend .",

    "( [ rmf2 ] ) includes only occupied levels with positive energy in the fermi sea .",
    "this means we do not consider vacuum polarization explicitly . since our parameters are adjusted to experimental data such effects are taken into account in an implicit way .",
    "let us now consider in detail the dyson equation , which describes the motion of a single nucleon in the nuclear interior : @xmath43 here the total self - energy @xmath44 contains all the forces acting on the nucleon .",
    "as long as one stays within rmf approach the nucleon self - energy contains only static and local contributions from the mesons and from the electromagnetic fields .",
    "when we go beyond the mean - field approximation , we have to take into account that in the general case the full self - energy @xmath44 is non - local in the space coordinates as well as in time .",
    "this non - locality means that its fourier transform has both momentum and energy dependence .",
    "let us now decompose the total self - energy matrix into two components , a static local and an energy dependent non - local term : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the static part known from rmf theory in eq .",
