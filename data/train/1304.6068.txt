    "hong - ou - mandel interference is a two - photon quantum interference effect whereby two _",
    "indistinguishable _ photons incident at either port of a balanced beam splitter will always be detected to coalesce at one or the other output port of the beam splitter , but never with one photon at each output port .",
    "this interference effect diminishes as the distinguishability of the photons is increased .",
    "it was first demonstrated by hong , ou and mandel in 1987 using photons produced via parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "the importance of this effect in optical implementations of quantum information processing schemes was realized later @xcite , motivating further demonstrations .",
    "they have been achieved both by using a single source @xcite and by using two independent sources @xcite of photons .",
    "in addition to these _ pulsed _ interference experiments , two - photon quantum interference using _ continuously - driven _ sources of resonant fluorescent light has also been demonstrated @xcite .    however , until the recent experiment of lang _ _ et al.__@xcite , a comparable demonstration of the same effect with _ microwave - frequency _ photons had been lacking .",

    "the calculation of these theory curves , corresponding to inputs consisting of trains of lorentzian photons , is presented here , along with the same calculation for gaussian photons .",
    "one could also perform the experiment with continuously - driven circuit qed systems , operated in the regime of _ resonant photon blockade _ @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the output second - order correlation functions in this case , though these are not directly relevant to the experiments described in ref .  .",
    "the calculation of the correlation functions in the pulsed case proceeds in a manner similar to that of legero _ _ et al.__@xcite , undertaken to describe their experiments on _ time - resolved _ two - photon quantum interference @xcite .",
    "we generalise their calculations in a number of ways .",
    "first , we consider lorentzian ( in addition to gaussian ) single photons .",
    "this is because here the spatio - temporal properties of the emitted photons are determined purely by the decay rate of the circuit qed source , rather than by additional broadening mechanisms .",
    "second , we calculate the correlation functions for a _ train _ of single photons , leading to features in the calculated correlation functions at ( and around ) integer multiples of the pulse period .",
    "further , these correlation functions are evaluated as _ circular _",
    "correlation functions , meaning that the correlations for a finite pulse train are obtained by wrapping the time index around the finite sequence of pulses .",
    "third , in order to make a comparison with experimental data , we subject the calculated correlation functions to filtering representative of the filtering that the measured data is subjected to .",
    "the second - order correlation functions at the output of the beam splitter are evaluated , in terms of correlation functions of input fields , in sec .",
    "[ sec : correlations ] .",
    "these are explicitly evaluated , for both individual and trains of pulsed single - photons ( gaussian and lorentzian ) , in sec .",

    "[ sec : continuouslydrivensources ] .",
    "note that neither the details of the extraction of the microwave correlation functions from the directly measured correlation functions in ref .",
    ", nor the details of the quantum state tomography employed in ref .  , are described here .",
    "they have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "suppose that the two fields incident on the input ports of the beam splitter are described by dimensionless , time - dependent quantum fields denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "unitarity of the ( balanced ) beam splitter implies that the output fields , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are then given by the heisenberg picture evolution @xcite , @xmath4 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\hat{a}'(t ) \\\\",
