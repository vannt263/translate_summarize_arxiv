    "( 1994 ) failed to detect x - ray emission from this quasar in their einstein ipc data .",
    "they derive an upper limit on @xmath95 of @xmath961.34 .",
    "it is known that a typical quasar will have @xmath95 in the range @xmath961.0 to @xmath962.0 with a mean of @xmath961.5 ( e.g. wilkes et al .",
    "thus in our model we use either @xmath95  =  @xmath961.5 or @xmath962.0 .",
    "the predicted column densities of h@xmath2 and c  i as a function of the ionizing parameter @xmath89 for different models are given in fig .  [ models ] ( the seds are shown for direct comparison in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "for all models , log  @xmath3(h  i )  =  21.35 and @xmath97  =  100  @xmath11 .",
    "we have checked that the exact value of @xmath97 has little effect on the results .    to reproduce the small @xmath3(c  i)/@xmath3(h  i ) ratio ,",
    "the spectrum must be steep to favor ionization of c  i. this is why a power - law spectrum with @xmath0  =  2 , a `` big - bump '' spectrum with @xmath95  =  2 and the starburst spectrum can reproduce the ratio with somewhat different ionizing parameters .",
    "the `` big - bump '' spectrum is favored because the x - ray tail maintains the temperature of the neutral gas above 100  k. the other models imply too low a temperature compared to what we derived from the h@xmath2 features .",
    "however all the models fail to reproduce at the same time the h@xmath2 column density .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that steeper spectra could meet the constraints .",
    "however again the temperature would be too low .",
    "moreover , all the models predict log  @xmath3(mg  i )  @xmath31  13.5 .",
    "this is a factor of seven larger than the upper limit we derived from the lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) data . in the framework of these models ,",
    "the only solution we can find is to decrease the abundances of carbon by a factor of two and that of magnesium by a factor of seven .",
    "this could reflect true relative abundances or depletion onto dust grains .",
    "dust is needed to explain the h@xmath2 column density as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "the h@xmath98 process is more efficient than the dust process at temperature @xmath65  @xmath31  500  k and when @xmath99 is not negligible , thus in the partially ionized region .",
    "however the very large h  i column density of this damped ly@xmath0 system requires most of the gas to be neutral where this process is negligible because of the low temperature resulting from the steep spectrum needed to explain the lack of c  i and mg  i.",
    "by fitting the different h@xmath2 transitions that we detect in a high resolution spectrum of pks  0528250 , we derive log  @xmath3(h@xmath2 )  @xmath4  16.78 and @xmath25  @xmath4  200  k that is most certainly the true kinetic temperature of the gas . for",
    "this temperature , the relative populations of rotational levels 0 to 4 indicate that the density is of the order of 1000  @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the dimension of the neutral cloud along the line of sight is less than 1  pc .",
    "it must be noticed that the damped absorber must cover the broad line region .",
    "indeed there is no residual flux in the bottom of the ly@xmath0 absorption line which completely absorbs the ly@xmath0 emission from the quasar over more than 5000  km  s@xmath24 ( mller & warren 1993 ) . since the dimension of the blr in qsos can be approximated as @xmath33  @xmath4  0.3  @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the bolometric luminosity in units of 10@xmath102  erg  s@xmath24 ( collin , private communication ) .",
    "the radius of the blr in pks  0528250 is thus of the order of 10  pc .",
    "the transverse dimension of the damped cloud must be thus larger than 10  pc and the cloud must be quite flat .",
    "we can derive an upper limit on the transverse dimension of the cloud by interpreting the non - dection of redshifted 21 cm absorption ( carilli et al .",
    "1996 ) as an effect of partial covering factor of the continuum radio emission by the cloud . indeed",
    "the size of the radio source is 1  arcsec or 5@xmath103  kpc . if the spin temperature is equal to the kinetic temperature we derived in sect .",
    "3.2 , this implies that the covering factor should be less than 0.3 and thus the radius of the cloud along the transverse direction is less than 1  kpc .",
    "we determine upper limits for the c  i , mg  i and co column densities ( log  @xmath3(c  i )  @xmath12  12.7 , log  @xmath3(mg  i )  @xmath12  12.8 and log  @xmath3(co )  @xmath12  13.2 ) .",
    "based on simple photoionization models we conclude that ( i ) no simple model can reproduce at the same time the low @xmath3(c  i)/@xmath3(h  i ) , @xmath3(mg  i)/@xmath3(h  i ) ratios and the presence of molecules at the level observed ; ( ii ) steep spectra are required to reproduce the low @xmath3(c  i)/@xmath3(h  i ) and @xmath3(mg  i)/@xmath3(h  i ) ratios but they predict temperatures smaller than 100  k in conflict with the excitation temperature derived from the h@xmath2 transitions ; ( iii ) the only way to keep the temperature as high as 200  k is to allow for some x - ray flux heating the gas ; ( iv ) in the framework of these models , dust is needed to produce the observed amount of molecules ; ( v ) the gas phase abundances of carbon and especially magnesium should be smaller than 0.1 of solar .    in view of the models we explored , the most likely ionizing spectrum is a composite of a uv-``big bump '' possibly produced by a local starburst and a power - law spectrum from the qso that provides the x - rays .",
