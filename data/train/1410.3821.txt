    "impurity models , describing small quantum systems coupled to one or multiple baths of bosons or fermions , have seen a lot of activity over the last years , for a variety of reasons : ( i ) impurity models display a rich phenomenology , including local fermi - liquid and non - fermi - liquid behavior,@xcite phase transitions and quantum criticality,@xcite as well as interesting properties far from equilibrium.@xcite ( ii ) impurity models can often be simulated by numerical means more efficiently than lattice models,@xcite such that , on the one hand , high - accuracy numerical results can guide analytical approaches and , on the other hand , analytical concepts can be readily tested numerically .",
    "a particularly interesting branch is non - equilibrium physics where quantum impurity models have served a test bed for methodological developments .",

    "while the field induces tunneling ( i.e.  delocalization ) between the two states , the oscillator bath causes friction and impedes tunneling . for gapless baths , characterized by a power - law spectral density @xmath0 with @xmath1 , this competition results in a quantum phase transition between a delocalized and a localized phase which has been studied extensively.@xcite as has been shown both analytically and numerically,@xcite this quantum phase transition obeys the so - called quantum - to - classical correspondence : it is equivalent to the thermal phase transition of a classical ising chain with long - ranged interactions falling off as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance between two classical spins.@xcite    in this paper we consider the generalization of the spin - boson model to two baths ( @xmath4 below),@xcite dubbed sbm2 .",

    "the model sbm2 is governed not only by the competition between the local field , which tends to point the spin in the @xmath8 direction , and the dissipative bath effects , but also by a competition between the two baths , as an oscillator bath which couples to @xmath20 tends to localize the spin in @xmath21 direction . as a result",
    ", the combined dissipative effect of both baths in sbm2 can be smaller than that of one bath alone ( in a sense which will become clear in the course of the paper )  an effect which has been dubbed `` frustration of decoherence''.@xcite in practical realizations of sbm2 , the two baths can be two different sources of dissipation influencing a quantum bit,@xcite or two spin - wave modes which couple to a magnetic impurity in a magnet.@xcite    the model sbm2 is of particular theoretical interest because it displays a non - trivial intermediate - coupling ( i.e. critical ) phase , characterized by partial screening of the impurity degree of freedom corresponding to a fractional residual moment , not unlike in the two - channel kondo state.@xcite the existence of this critical phase , originally deduced by perturbative rg arguments,@xcite was recently confirmed numerically.@xcite the latter study , performed using a variational matrix - product - state ( vmps ) approach , also revealed that the critical phase is unstable at large couplings , resulting in a complex phase diagram .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the physics of sbm2 in some detail , extending the results published in ref .  , with particular focus on the quantum phase transitions occurring in this model . to this end , we combine vmps calculations with analytical renormalization - group and scaling approaches . our implementation of vmps , including the use of the u(1 ) symmetry and an optimized boson basis , enables highly accurate studies of quantum critical behavior",
