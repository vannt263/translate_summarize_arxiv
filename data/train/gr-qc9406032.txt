    "its gravitational magnetic dipole moment ( gravitomagnetism ) as predicted by einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "this gravitomagnetic field causes local inertial frames to be dragged around with the earth at a rate proportional to the angular momentum of the earth , and inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the center of the earth .",
    "thus the line of nodes of the orbital plane of lageos-3 precesses eastward at @xmath0 .",
    "although in this example the frame dragging effect is small compared to the torque on the orbital plane due to the oblateness of the earth , it is an essential ingredient in the dynamics of accretion disks , binary systems , and other astrophysical phenomena  @xcite .    today , almost eighty years after einstein introduced his geometric theory of gravity , we have just begun to measure  to verify  his gravitation theory . of no less stature than the `` tide producing ''",
    "@xmath1 `` electric component '' of gravity is the inertial - frame defining `` magnetic component '' of gravitation @xmath2 . to see this force in action : first , inject a satellite into a polar orbit about an earth - like mass idealized as not spinning with respect to the distant quasars .",
    "the satellite will remain in orbit in a continuous acceleration towards the center - of - mass of the attracting body under the influence of the newtonian @xmath3 force , and its orbital plane will remain fixed in orientation with respect to distant quasars .",
    "second , spin the central body , giving it angular momentum , and follow the trajectory of the satellite . its orbital plane will experience a torque along the central body s rotation axis .",
    "the orbital plane will undergo a precessional motion in the direction of the central body s rotation .",
    "the mass in motion of the central body , or `` mass current '' , produces a dipole gravitational field  the gravitomagnetic field . in the case of a satellite orbiting at two earth radii",
    ", the orbital plane will precess about the body axis of the earth at approximately @xmath4 .",
    "this is the lense - thirring effect @xcite .",
    "the lense - thirring force has never been directly measured .",
    "a measurement of this gravitomagnetic force can be compared to the pioneering work of michael faraday on the measurement of the magnetic force between two current - carrying wires",
    ". however , the laboratory setting for this gravity measurement will be the 4-dimensional curved spacetime ( approximately kerr ) geometry enveloping the earth .",
    "the idea behind the lageos gravity measurement is simple . whereas the everitt - fairbanks experiment ( gravity probe - b ) proposes putting a gyroscope into polar orbit  @xcite , the ciufolini lageos-3/lageos-1 experiment @xcite proposes the use of the orbital planes themselves as a gyroscope .    in 1976",
    "nasa launched the lageos-1 satellite , a totally passive @xmath5 diameter ball of aluminum with @xmath6 retro - reflecting mirrors embedded in its surface .",
    "( there are numerous globally - located laser tracking stations to observe lageos - type satellites . )",
    "lageos-1 was injected into a two earth - radii circular orbit at an inclination of @xmath7 . due to the oblateness of the earth",
    ", the orbital plane rotates at a rate of @xmath8 .",
    "this torquing can only be modeled to @xmath9  which is not accurate enough to measure the @xmath10 gravitomagnetic force .",
    "the idea of ciufolini is to launch another lageos satellite ( lageos-3 ) into an orbit identical to that of lageos-1 , except that its inclination is supplementary ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this proposed orbital plane will rotate in the opposite direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 .",
    "the intersection of the two ( lageos-1 , lageos-3 ) orbital planes will sweep out a `` tandem - generated gyro plane '' ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the utilization of two satellites cancels out many of the large precessional effects due to mass eccentricities of the earth , providing a plane inertial enough for a measurement , accurate to five percent ( or better ) , of the `` magnetic component '' of gravity .    =",
    "the success of the lageos experiment hinges upon the detection of a @xmath10 eastward drift of the line of nodes of the two satellites .",
    "a strong effort is now underway to model the orbital and spin dynamics of these satellites , and to make an assessment of the uncertainties these will add to the desired measurements .",
    "encapsulated in table  [ table1 ] are the five major classes of errors in this experiment : ( 1 ) geopotential ( other than even zonals ) and tides , ( 2 ) earth radiation pressure , ( 3 ) uncertainty in other relativistic effects , ( 4 ) earth and solar - induced thermal forces , and ( 5 ) even zonal geopotentials ( per @xmath13 inclination injection error ) . due to the recent gem - t1 improvements in the earth",
    "s zonal harmonics , the errors due to solid - earth tides have been significantly reduced , and are now potentially smaller than those due to surface effects @xcite .",
    "these surface effects ( _ e.g. _ ,  yarkowsky thermal drag , neutral and charged particle drag ) cause a change in the nodal precession of the satellite , thus contributing to what will be potentially the largest source of error in the lageos-3 measurement of the gravitomagnetic effect . in modeling these surface forces , in particular the yarkowsky thermal drag ( also referred to as the rubincam effect ) due to the satellite s differential heating and delayed reradiation , the behavior of the spin vector of the satellite is of crucial importance . that the uncertainties induced by the surface forces on lageos are on the order of 4% , out of a 6% experiment , makes such a theoretical modeling of paramount importance . with this in mind , we undertake in this paper a theoretical model of the spin dynamics of lageos - type satellites , and compare our results with observational data .",
    "we must emphasize that we are looking for qualitative , not quantitative , results .",
    "we do not intend to predict the exact magnitude and direction of the spin vector at any particular instant .",
    "instead , we desire a rough estimate of its magnitude , and whether its behavior is predictable or chaotic .",
    "we seek to answer questions of the sort : `` in the asymptotic limit , does the satellite tidally lock , tumble , or have some other behavior ? ''    previous studies of the spin dynamics of the lageos-1 satellite @xcite were valid only for spin rates much larger than the orbital frequency . today , however , the spin of the satellite , decaying with a three - year time constant , is rapidly approaching the orbital period .",
    "we therefore require an analysis in the low  frequency regime .",
    "unlike the earlier analysis which dealt with orbit - averaged quantities , we will solve numerically the full set of dynamical equations .",
    "as we will show , while the low frequency regime exhibits complex behavior , the asymptotic state of this forced , damped system appears to be tidally locked . in this paper",
    "we will examine the spin - orbit resonance phase and discuss the asymptotic state of the spin of the satellite .",
    "it is the goal of this research to provide an optimum strategy for the measurement of the spin dynamics of the lageos satellites in support of the proposed gravity measurement .",
    "in addition , we use our theoretical model to propose an optimum orbital injection procedure for lageos-3 : it is our opinion that the lageos-3 satellite should be injected into the orbital plane with as large a spin rate as possible .",
    "our results provide the first analysis of the asymptotic spin dynamics of the lageos satellite .",
    "previous calculations were unable to analyze the spin - orbit resonances of the satellite , nor its asymptotic behavior , which will play a crucial role in the experiment .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that the lageos-1 satellite will be sufficiently predictable to support the gravitomagnetic measurement .    .",
    "* the latest error budget for the lageos-3 lense - thirring experiment*. errors in geopotential and tides reflect improvement over gem - t1 .",
    "uncertainty in the thermal forces depends mainly on knowledge of spin - axis motion .",
    "the even zonal geopotential error calculation assumes less than @xmath14 inclination injection error .",
    "the random and stochastic error estimate can accommodate seasonal variations in low degree spherical harmonics of the geopotential .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is rather interesting that after 36 years the spin dynamics of passive satellites is once again important to the field of astrodynamics . in 1957",
    "vinti @xcite analyzed the spin dynamics of a non - ferromagnetic spherical satellite in the earth s magnetic field , which was then of critical importance to the alignment of antennas .",
    "today we perform the same analysis on a slightly oblate satellite , of critical importance to the first measurement of the magnetic component of gravity , as predicted by einstein .",
    "there are many factors to consider when analyzing the spin dynamics of an oblate , metallic satellite orbiting in the gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth .",
    "the most prominent effect is the torqueing due to the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "this arises from the oblateness of the satellite , with the oblateness of the earth producing a negligible contribution that can be added to our calculations as an adiabatic correction . if the satellite s ( bulging ) equatorial plane lies in the plane of orbit , no such torques are possible .",
    "however , when the satellite is not placed exactly in such a position , gravitational torques will arise . in an effort to model these torques ,",
    "we consider the situation of an oblate spheroid in orbit around a point mass . as was done by bertotti and iess , we parallel the development in goldstein @xcite .",
    "bertotti and iess s analysis of the effects of gravity on the spin dynamics of the oblate satellite , which resulted in predicting a _ chaotic _ spin dynamics of arbitrarily large amplitude in the obliquity at late times , is not appropriate for small rates of spin .",
    "their prediction is based on the `` hipparcos '' formula for the rate of precession @xmath15 of an oblate satellite in the inhomogeneous gravity field of the earth @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the orbital angular velocity , @xmath18 is the satellite spin rate , @xmath19 is the obliquity angle of the satellite ( the angle between @xmath20 and the normal to the orbital plane ) and @xmath21 is the satellite s oblateness . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the principal moments of inertia ( the principal direction corresponding to @xmath22 is assumed to be that of @xmath20 and coincides , by assumption , with the symmetry axis of the oblate satellite ) .",
    "it is argued by bertotti and iess that , since @xmath24 , the gravitational precession in the asymptotic limit of small @xmath25 becomes very fast and may make the spin dynamics chaotic .",
    "this conclusion is based upon a misunderstanding .",
    "we have shown , via a careful analysis of assumptions underlying the `` hipparcos '' formula , that even in the approximation commonly used in deriving the formula ( averaging of the gravitational potential over the satellite orbit , dipole cutoff of the multipole decomposition , _ etc .",
    "_ ) eqn .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can only be used when @xmath26 _ i.e. _ , when the spin rate of the satellite is much greater than its orbital angular velocity .",
    "the latter restriction is easy to overcome , and the corrected equation for @xmath15 is @xmath27 this equation imposes a bound on @xmath28 : @xmath29 which makes it clear that the rate of precession can not grow to cause chaoticity of the satellite spin dynamics .",
    "a subsequent qualitative investigation @xcite by chris fuchs has shown that when magnetic forces are included in the picture the precession rate remains bounded , and should be much smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "another conclusion reached in the course of our analysis has been that , when both gravitational and magnetic forces are taken into account , the nutation , although bounded in its amplitude , does not disappear completely even in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the value of these results , however , is limited by the fact that they do not yield the exact bounds , nor do they provide any information on the time scale to reach the asymptotic limit .",
    "however , they do clearly show that chaoticity of the lageos spin dynamics caused by an unbounded growth of gravitationally - induced precession can not occur .",
    "another important factor governing the evolution of the spin vector is the interaction of the metallic core of the satellite with the magnetic field of the earth .",
    "the lageos satellite @xcite is composed of two aluminum hemispheres bolted together , with a brass cylindrical core along its body axis ( the original axis of spin ) ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the spinning of this metallic object in the magnetic dipole field of the earth ( and the motion through that field ) will cause eddy currents within the satellite , which will in turn cause dissipation through joule heating and a slowdown of the spin , and furthermore will cause torques on the spin vector .",
    "these torques can be understood as the interaction of the magnetic dipole , caused by the induced eddy currents , with the magnetic field of the earth . in modeling this effect ,",
    "we have treated a uniform , spherical object in the orbit of a perfect magnetic dipole .",
    "here we are concerned with a simple qualitative analysis of the spin dynamics of lageos , as the complexity of the true satellite geometry prohibits us from a precise model of the eddy current distribution .",
    "our theoretical model permits us to analyze arbitrary inclinations of the orbital plane to the earth s magnetic dipole axis .",
    "the results presented in this paper correspond to a retrograde @xmath30 orbit .    =    the problem of a spinning metallic sphere in a constant magnetic field has been treated by landau and lifshitz @xcite , and we avail ourselves of their results . for our purposes , we ignore the torques caused by the changing magnetic field due to the orbit ( as opposed to spin ) of the satellite . these torques can be shown to be negligible until asymptotically late stages of motion , and have no qualitative effects upon the dynamics .    the source of many of the difficulties in doing analyses of such orbiting , spinning bodies lies in the involved coordinate systems needed to describe their motion .",
    "thus , it is important at this point to give a brief description of the coordinates we will use in this paper . in our analysis of the spin dynamics of the lageos satellite we found it convenient to introduce the following four coordinate systems :    * 1 . * _ the orbit - centered inertial frame ( oci ) @xmath31 .",
    "_ here the @xmath32-axis is oriented along the normal to the orbital plane of the satellite ( @xmath33 coinclination ) .",
    "the @xmath34-axis is defined to be the intersection of the orbital plane and the earth s equatorial plane , and the origin is the center of mass of the earth .",
    "we have assumed here that this frame is inertial , and have not included the secular drag of the line - of - nodes of the orbital plane due to the oblateness of the earth .",
    "this @xmath35 precession can be included at the end of our analysis as an adiabatic correction , and again has no qualitative effects upon the dynamics .",
    "_ the earth - centered inertial ( eci ) reference frame @xmath36_. here the @xmath37-axis is aligned with the body axis of the earth .",
    "the @xmath38-axis lies in the earth",
    "s equatorial plane at zero degrees longitude , and the origin coincides with the center of the earth .",
    "* 3 . * _ the body frame ( non - inertial ) @xmath39 . _",
    "the origin is at the center of the satellite , and the axes correspond to a set of principal axes .",
    "the satellite is assumed to be a slightly oblate ( @xmath40 ) spheroid of brass , and the @xmath41-axis is aligned along its body axis .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 axes are an arbitrary fixed set of orthogonal axes spanning the equatorial plane of the satellite . in our calculations ,",
    "the body axis is related to the orbit - centered frame through the three euler angles @xmath19 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the nutation angle @xmath19 is the angle between @xmath41 and @xmath32 , while the angle of precession @xmath44 is the angle between the @xmath34-axis and the line of nodes ( the intersection of the orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the satellite ( @xmath42-@xmath43 plane ) ) .",
    "the spin angle @xmath45 is the angle between the line of nodes and the @xmath42-axis .",
    "* 4 . * _ the landau - lifshitz ( non - inertial ) coordinate system @xmath46 . _",
    "the @xmath47-axis is aligned along the instantaneous angular momentum vector of the satellite ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the @xmath49-axis is picked so that the instantaneous magnetic field ( @xmath50 ) at the satellite lies in the @xmath51 plane .",
    "note that @xmath47 need not be aligned with the body axis of the satellite , and in fact , during the asymptotic behavior of the satellite they are vastly different .",
    "in particular , the angle ( @xmath52 ) between the symmetry axis of the satellite ( @xmath53 ) and the instantaneous angular momentum vector ( @xmath54 ) can be expressed in terms of the three euler angles as @xmath55 in the early stages of the lageos mission when @xmath56 and @xmath57 this angle is rather small ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "a proper interpretation of the results of the numerical simulation requires a careful distinction between @xmath15 and @xmath59 ( where @xmath44 is the euler angle of the body frame ) .",
    "the two coincide only under the assumption that the @xmath18 component of the satellite s angular velocity is responsible for all of the satellite s energy , or , to put it differently , the angular momentum of the satellite is directed along the body axis of the satellite . as the satellite s spinning motion slows down , this last assumption is violated .",
    "@xmath15 represents only a part of @xmath59 , the other part being caused by the `` tidal locking '' effect . as we shall see ,",
    "this is exactly what happens in the asymptotic phase of the satellite s motion .",
    "nevertheless , both @xmath15 and @xmath59 remain bounded .",
    "the spin dynamics are determined by euler s equations @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath18 are the components of the satellite s angular velocity in the body frame , @xmath23 , @xmath22 are the principal moments of inertia , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the components of the torques along the satellite s principal axes . after substituting the expressions for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath18 in terms of the euler angles",

    "therefore , the spin - orbit resonance should occur at @xmath161 , which is in agreement with the numerical results .",

    "the anisotropic heating of the satellite , and subsequent reradiation , gives a `` thermal rocketing '' perturbation ( referred to as the rubincam effect or the yarkowsky thermal drag ) which tends to degrade the experiment . to model this effect requires , in part , a detailed knowledge of the behavior of the angular momentum of the satellite . toward this end",
    "we have derived , and solved numerically , a simplified set of euler equations that evolve the angular momentum vector for a slightly oblate spheroid of brass orbiting an earth - like mass , idealized as being a perfect sphere and having a perfect polar - oriented dipole magnetic field .",
    "the euler equations included both the tidal gravitational torques and the eddy - current torques , as well as the resistive damping torques , as modeled by complex magnetization coefficients . using this rather simplified model ,",
    "we have identified three phases of the rotational dynamics ",
    "a fast spin phase , a spin - orbit resonance phase , and an asymptotic phase ( fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "we have also identified an error in the previously established model of asymptotic spin dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this error has led to confusion and , in attempts to reconcile observed data with theoretical predictions , has led others to hypothesize erroneous models for the moments of inertia of lageos-1 @xcite .",
    "our results have led us to formulate four as yet unresolved questions : ( 1 ) can we obtain the asymptotic solution analytically , and in so doing can we understand the wobbling or slippage of the euler angles with respect to the relatively stable total instantaneous angular velocity ? ; ( 2 ) can we understand why the _ rms _ fluctuations in the gravitational potential energy cause the asymptotic value of the angular momentum vector to be offset from the orbital plane by @xmath167 ? ; ( 3 ) can we understand why the nutation angle ( @xmath19 ) drifts initially at a rate of @xmath168 and reaches a pseudo - stable value of @xmath169 ? ; and ( 4 ) can we understand the fluctuations in the spin rate ( @xmath145 ) over the first @xmath170 , which do not appear to have been detected experimentally ? we are addressing these questions by ( 1 ) introducing a more realistic model of the satellite and earth into our calculations @xcite , and ( 2 ) exploring more of phase space by way of poincare sections . the results presented here provide us with clues that must be pieced together to reveal the physics behind the complex motion we observe .",
    "the current spin dynamics model suggests that we launch lageos-3 , with as large a spin @xmath171 as possible , into an obliquity of @xmath172 ; although , due to the qualitative nature of our results , the precise numbers are far from being conclusive .",
    "we are currently working with the center for space research at the university of texas at austin to determine the impact this revised model of the spin dynamics of lageos will have on the lageos-3 mission ( in particular , how will the rubincam effect alter the line of nodes of the orbital plane ? ) .",
    "in addition , we are working closely with colleagues at the university of texas and the university of maryland to reconcile the experimental measurements of the spin dynamics of lageos-1 with our theoretical model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will propose an optimal experimental measurement schedule in support of the proposed lageos-3 mission .",

    "<S> ciufolini has suggested the launch of an identical satellite ( lageos-3 ) into an orbit supplementary to that of lageos-1 : lageos-3 would then experience an equal and opposite classical precession to that of lageos-1 . besides providing a more accurate real - time measurement of the earth s length of day and polar wobble </S>",
    "<S> , this paired - satellite experiment would provide the first direct measurement of the general relativistic frame - dragging effect . </S>",
    "<S> of the five dominant error sources in this experiment , the largest one involves surface forces on the satellite , and their consequent impact on the orbital nodal precession . </S>",
    "<S> the surface forces are a function of the spin dynamics of the satellite . </S>",
