    "very recently , the d0 collaboration observed a new narrow structure in the @xmath6 invariant mass spectrum , named @xmath0 , the mass and width of the structure are @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the observed channel indicates the isospin of the @xmath0 is 1 .",
    "if the structure decays into @xmath6 via a @xmath9wave , the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 are @xmath10 . as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed structure may decay through the chain @xmath11 , in which the soft photon may not be detected since the mass gap of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is less than 50 mev . in this case",
    ", this structure decays into @xmath14 , and the mass of the structure should be shifted by addition of the mass difference of @xmath15 and @xmath13 , which is about @xmath16 mev , while the width remains unchanged .",
    "this structure would be named @xmath1 with the quantum number @xmath17 if it couples to @xmath18 via the lowest @xmath9wave .",
    "the quark components of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , thus @xmath0 is a kind of structures with four different flavors of quarks , which is observed for the first time .",
    "this peculiar property of the @xmath0 indicates that it could not be a conventional meson formed by a quark and a antiquark . for a system composed of two quarks and two antiquarks ,",
    "the color factorization property of the system indicates a two - mesons deuteron - like hadronic molecule structure .",
    "some newly observed hadron states have been extensively investigated in hadronic molecule scenario .",

    "similarly , the masses and decay behaviors of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 were estimated in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 hadronic molecular pictures , respectively @xcite .    as for the discussed @xmath0 or @xmath1",
    ", we can find that this structure could be decomposed into a bottom - strange meson and a light meson or a bottom meson and a strange meson .",
    "for the former case , the bottom - strange meson and light meson could not interact by exchanging a conventional quark - antiquark meson and form a bound state . while for the later case , the bottom and strange mesons could form a hadronic molecule state by exchanging a proper light meson .",
    "we notice that the thresholds of @xmath5 and @xmath3 are @xmath29 and @xmath30 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the observed masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are about 200 mev below the thresholds of @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus , we can assign the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reported by the d0 collaboration as a deeply bounded @xmath2 or @xmath3 hadronic molecule state with @xmath31 , which is different with the one discussed in ref .",
