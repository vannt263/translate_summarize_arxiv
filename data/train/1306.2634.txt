    "this class of galaxies is crucial to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution within a cosmological framework .",

    "it provides a 2.2 deg@xmath32 field of view with a 0.27@xmath33pixel@xmath25 resolution ; the instrument providing @xmath34 fwhm to the resultant image quality @xcite .",
    "the main scientific goal of the project is to investigate dark energy by measuring cosmic expansion via baryon acoustic oscillations , galaxy clustering , weak lensing and supernovae .",
    "however , the combination of survey area and depth also make des an invaluable data set for galaxy evolution studies .",
    "in particular des will allow us to search for rare objects and events such as massive galaxies and mergers or nearby objects which require a combination of depth and large area coverage ( such as milky way satellites , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in order to make predictions of the possible numbers of massive high redshift galaxies which are likely to be detected by des , we compare the predicted numbers of sources in the des - w survey volume ( the largest volume probed by the two des surveys ) for a hierarchical growth model ( as traced by the millennium simulation ) , by passively evolving the @xmath35 and @xmath36 mass functions , and using the @xmath37 mass function from @xcite , based on a fit to existing data in the literature .",
    "the extreme cases of the hierarchical growth model and passive stellar evolution provide a lower and upper limit respectively on the number of galaxies that des may identify , while the @xcite values display a more realistic prediction of the true number of sources .",
    "hierarchical growth models predict a paucity of the most massive objects at high redshift , while passively evolving the lower redshift mass functions assumes all low redshift giant ellipticals formed at high redshift ( thus providing an upper limit ) .",
    "the millennium run simulation @xcite uses @xmath38cdm cosmology to trace the evolution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe via n - body simulations and delineates the gravitational buildup of large scale structure via hierarchical growth .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are applied to the cdm framework to investigate the evolution of baryonic matter in a @xmath38cdm universe .",
    "hence , using these models we can make predictions about the likely number densities of galaxies at any given epoch within the @xmath38cdm framework .",
    "we use the de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) semi - analytic galaxy formation model run on the millennium simulation to produce a mock pencil beam pointing between @xmath39 and determine the mass function for luminous sources of @xmath40m@xmath2 .",
    "the volume of this pointing is scaled to the size of the full des simulation volume ( 5000deg@xmath27 ) .",
    "no log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath2)@xmath43 galaxies are found within the simulation .",
    "however , the lack of these most massive systems is likely to be an artefact of simulation volume being inadequate in containing the most massive systems ( the simulation does not trace the full spectrum of cosmic variance in a hierarchical model ) .",
    "we therefore extrapolate the mass function from lower mass galaxies using a schechter function fit .",
    "we note that while the millennium run simulation value of @xmath44 may not be consistent with the wmap7 data , applying the more recent value of @xmath44 would not significantly change the predictions made in this paper - it suggests lower numbers counts of massive high redshift sources in a @xmath38cdm universe .",
    "in contrast , using a passive stellar evolution model the co - moving number density of massive galaxies at high redshift is forced to be equal with those at low redshift .",
    "@xcite used sdss to calculate the low redshift stellar mass function for early type galaxies assuming a @xcite type imf .",
    "we calculate the co - moving volume of des at @xmath45 and determine the predicted numbers of galaxies assuming this passive evolution .",
    "we also calculate the predicted numbers of massive high redshift galaxies by passively evolving the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) mass function for @xmath36 sources , for a @xcite type imf @xcite .",
    "as discussed previously , these passive evolution estimates provide an upper limit to the possible number of galaxies des may identify .",
    "lastly , in order to produce a more realistic estimate for the true number of massive high redshift sources we use the recent summary of the high redshift mass function taken from @xcite - using a @xcite imf",

    "clearly , the identification of any log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath2)@xmath43 source at @xmath46 in des will help constrain galaxy formation models .",
    "the @xcite mass function predicts that @xmath48 log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath2)@xmath43 galaxies should be observed in the des survey volume .",
    "however , only @xmath49 of these would represent true log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath2)@xmath43 systems , with the rest being identified as massive galaxies through eddington bias ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this number of sources predicted from @xcite represents the best estimate for the true number of massive sources at @xmath46 .",
    "hence , in our further analysis we will assume this number density .",
    "for comparison we also display the number of m@xmath16m@xmath2 galaxies identified at @xmath17 in the newfirm medium - band survey ( nmbs , * ? ? ?",

    "this value is consistent with the true number of massive high redshift galaxies falling between the semi - analytic and passive evolution predictions and close to the @xcite predictions .",
    "while the @xcite findings help constrain the number density of massive high redshift galaxies , the small area probed ( @xmath50deg@xmath32 ) does not allow the identification of more massive ( and hence rarer ) systems which may be identified in des .",
    "however , if we use the best fit schecter function parameters obtained in @xcite for both @xcite and @xcite stellar population models , and extrapolate to higher masses , we find @xmath151.5 and 0.02 @xmath51m@xmath2 systems in the des survey volume respectively - much lower than those predicted by @xcite .    however the question remains , if such systems exist should they have already been identified in current surveys ?",
    "the predicted number counts of true sources from @xcite predict @xmath52 log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath2)@xmath43 source per 50deg@xmath5 .",
    "while some large scale surveys cover sufficient area to identify such sources ( @xmath9 sdss ) , the do not have the required depth . in order to produce the stellar masses of giant ellipticals over a brief period of time",
    ", we might expect such systems to be ` scaled up ' versions of a more normal high redshift star - forming galaxy .",
    "typical lyman - break galaxies at @xmath13 have masses @xmath53m@xmath2 and have z - band magnitudes of @xmath54 @xcite . assuming a constant stellar mass to light ratio ( @xmath55 the luminosity scales directly with mass )",
    ", a @xmath56m@xmath2 source at @xmath13 would potentially have a z - band magnitude of @xmath57 .",
    "this may not be the case as the observable uv - bright stellar populations in lbgs may not represent their true stellar mass .",
    "underlying , older stellar populations ( from previous star formation episodes ) may form a large fraction of their stellar mass ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of these underlying populations are problematic at all wavelengths due to _ overshining _ by the younger component . however , due to the lack of detailed understanding of older stellar populations in lbgs at @xmath13 , in this simple analysis we assume the mass derived from the uv - bright component is representative of the true mass of the galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : surveys ] displays the @xmath58 z - band depth against area for a sample of current surveys . shallow , large area surveys ( such as sdss or rcs ) fall at the top left of the plot and deep small field of view surveys ( such as sdf and hudf ) to the bottom right .",
    "the grey shaded region represents the parameter space in which a survey is likely to detect @xmath59 massive , high redshift galaxies - taken from the predicted number counts assuming the @xcite mass function and ` scaling up ' the flux from a typical high redshift star - forming galaxy ( as described above ) .",
    "all existing wide area surveys are too shallow and deep surveys too small in area to identify these massive high redshift galaxies .",
    "however , the unique combination of depth and area coverage of des - w lies above the general trend of decreasing z - band limit with area and thus will provide the first opportunity to detect these galaxies , should they exist .",
    "we find that , although above the general trend of deceasing area with survey sensitivity , the des - d survey does not cover sufficient area to be likely to detect these highly rare sources .",
    "hence , in any further discussion we shall only considier the des - w survey .",
    "due to its large volume and depth , des will contain over 300 million galaxies .",
    "thus , differentiating massive high redshift galaxies from their smaller counterparts at lower redshift will be the major challenge .",
    "we therefore model possible massive high redshift galaxies and determine their detectability and possible colours using the des filters .          using a library of stellar population models",
    "@xcite we model massive galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we consider a broad range of potential star - formation histories and galaxy parameters utilising the full parameter space of the @xcite models .",
    "we use simple stellar populations ( ssps ) with @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , 1/200 , 1/50 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.5 solar metallicities and ages ranging from @xmath60yrs - 15gyr .",
    "we also use composite stellar population ( csps ) models with exponentially decaying star formation rates ( sfr ) and e - folding time - scales ranging from 0.1 to 20gyr .",
    "we use csps with @xcite imf for solar metallicity and @xcite imf for 2 , 1 , 0.5 and 0.2 solar metallicity , over ages ranging from 1myr to 15gyr . for both sets of models",
    "we use total stellar masses ranging from 10.0@xmath61log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath2)@xmath6212.5 at 0.5 intervals .",
    "we also investigate the inverted tau models ( with sfr @xmath63 ) of @xcite for solar metallicity and 0.1 , 0.5 and 3 gyr e - folding time - scales with ages between 1myr to 3gyr .",
    "recent studies have shown that these types of star - formation histories may be applicable at high redshift ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "we note that we do not consider more stochastic star - formation histories .",
    "high redshift sources are likely to be detected through their instantaneous ( uv - bright ) star - formation .",
    "hence , their detectability is only likely to depend of their current burst of star - formation ( and not previous star - formation episodes ) - which is well represented by a single burst model .",
    "each stellar population model is shifted and stretched in wavelength to represent a galaxy at @xmath64 3 , 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 , 5 , 5.5 and 6 ( correcting for luminosity distance dimming and bandwidth stretching ) . initially all ssp and csp models are considered at all redshifts with no consideration of formation epoch .",
    "this may lead to the unrealistic formation redshifts for some models , however these will be removed at a later stage .",
    "all models are also corrected for neutral hydrogen absorption via the prescription outlined in @xcite .",
    "model galaxy fluxes are convolved with the des filter sets and we calculate observed magnitudes . any model galaxy with a magnitude of brighter than the des @xmath58 limiting magnitudes ( 25.5 , 25.0 , 24.4 , 23.9 , 22.0 in g , r , i , z and y respectively ) in any band is identified as a possible source that has the potential to be detected by des .",
    "while this formal 5@xmath29 limit may not represent a true 5@xmath29 detection in the resultant data ( once systematic errors are included ) , we note that in typical high redshift galaxy studies @xmath65 detection limits ( with additional visual classification ) are applied ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we model sources which will be detectable at a formal 5@xmath29 limit and note that these sources may fall below this limit in the resultant des data .",
    "figure [ fig : trends ] displays the trends with redshift of e - folding time , metallicity , age and mass of models that would be identified as brighter than the des limits in any band for the csp models . at this stage we only consider model galaxies with zero extinction , but we will discuss the effects of dust obscuration in section [ sec : dust ] .",
    "we display the median ( solid line ) , minimum ( dotted line ) and maximum ( dashed line ) for the parameters of detectable objects . in addition , the dot - dashed line in the bottom left panel displays the age of the universe at each redshift , in the adopted cosmology .",
    "since all of the mock galaxies are considered at all redshifts , independently of the age of the universe within the adopted cosmological model , some model galaxies which are identified have ages which are older than the universe ( as discussed previously ) , these are disregarded in any subsequent analysis .",
    "we also note that a number of these galaxies display unrealistic star - formation histories , requiring exceptionally large sfrs in order to build their stellar mass in their young lifetimes .",
    "however , as we know nothing of the nature of these potential , massive high redshifts systems , we do not rule out an potential model at this stage of our analysis .",
    "the full parameter space investigated using the csp models is highlighted with the grey regions .",
    "e - folding time scale and metallicity do not vary over the large redshift range probed and cover the full range of parameter space .",
    "hence , these parameters will not affect the type of galaxies which are likely to be detected .",
    "as expected , the limits of detectable galaxies decrease in age ( as depicted by the maximum age ) and increase in mass ( as depicted by the minimum mass ) at higher redshifts as younger and more massive systems are brighter and hence better detectable at larger luminosity distances .",
    "des is therefore likely to detect galaxies which are log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath66 and @xmath610gyr old at @xmath67 and galaxies which are log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath68 and @xmath692gyr old at @xmath70 .    obviously , these galaxy parameters are not independent .",
    "figure [ fig : joint_trends ] displays the joint constraints of mass vs age , e - folding time vs age and mass vs e - folding time at @xmath7=3 , 4 , 5 and 6 of objects likely to be detectable by des .",
    "there is little joint constraint between mass and e - folding timescale as the full range of e - folding timescales are detectable at all masses . at large e - folding timescales objects",
    "have a range of ages with the upper limit governed by the redshift of the source , however at lower e - folding times a small number of galaxies must be younger in order to be detected .",
    "obviously , there is a strong joint constraint between mass and age . at large masses",
    "our model sources once again cover a large range of ages with and upper limit governed by their redshift .",
    "however , at lower masses galaxies must be increasingly younger to yield a detection .",
    "for example at @xmath13 , if a source is @xmath71myrs old ( formation epoch of @xmath72 ) then it must have a mass @xmath73m@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , galaxies must either be very young or very massive ( or both ) to be detected by des at high redshift .",
    "galaxies with exponentially increasing ( inverted tau ) type star formation histories are also likely to be detected at all redshifts ( figure [ fig : trends_invert ] ) , with sources covering a similar range of model parameters .",
    "thus , modelling potential high redshift galaxies ( in a more complex prescription than scaling from lower mass high redshift star - forming galaxies - as discussed in section [ sec : nums ] ) also predicts that des should detect any massive ( log@xmath41(m@xmath42/m@xmath74 ) high redshift systems within its survey volume ( for a range of model ages , e - folding times and metallicities ) .",
    "we also find that the majority of detectable objects are very young and therefore their formation epoch will be similar to their detection epoch .",
    "it is found that the ssps models require galaxies with slightly younger ages and lower metallicities than the csp models in order to be detected by des , however they generally show similar model properties . for simplicity , in the following discussion we shall only consider the csp models with exponentially decaying sf .      in order to investigate the effects of dust on the detectability of sources , we apply the @xcite dust extinction law to all model galaxy spectra and",
    "repeat the analysis . in the absence of any information about potential dust extinctions in massive galaxies at high redshift",

    "we find that for moderate dust extinction , young and massive galaxies are still likely to be detected by des .",
    "figure [ fig : ex_trends ] displays the effects of varying dust extinction on the maximum age and minimum mass at which galaxies are detectable . as ought to be expected , the maximum age of galaxies is decreased and the minimum mass is increased as dust extinction is increased .",
    "this occurs as brighter more vigorous star - formation is required for a detection .",
    "if dust extinctions are increased to e(b - v)@xmath760.6 ( similar to those in sub - mm selected galaxies , @xmath9 * ? ? ?",

    "however , this result does suggest that older , massive galaxies with moderate dust extinction ( such as bzk selected galaxies * ? ? ?",

    "this represent a lower ( in the case of the two bluest bands ) and upper ( in the case of the two reddest bands ) limit to the true colour . these source",
    "would still be selected in our sample if their true colours were known .",
    "for example , a @xmath13 source which is undetected in both r - band and z - band may have a lower limit to its r - i colour of 1.0 and upper limit to its i - z colour of 0.0 .",
    "as our colour selections cover all regions of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , this source will always match our colour selection irrelevant of its true r - band and z - band magnitudes .",
    "hence , it is included in our selection .    the simulated massive galaxies of this work",
    "can be differentiated from the majority of lower redshift galaxies at all redshifts , except @xmath12 where colour selection maybe problematic due to a lack of u - band photometric data .",
    "dwarf stars may provide some contamination sources at @xmath13 and 6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion ) .",
    "despite this m dwarf stars in the halo of the galaxy are typically faint in r , i and z bands .",
    "hence , they are unlikely to be detected at the depths achieved by des and should not provide a significant level of contamination .",
    "qsos may provide contamination at all redshift .",
    "however , if such qsos are currently undocumented , they will be equally interesting candidates for followup spectroscopic observations . for further discussion of contaminating sources see section [ sec : contam ] .",
    "we propose initial colour selection criteria for the identification of relatively complete samples of massive high redshift galaxies ( dotted lines in figure [ fig : col_cols ] ) at increasing redshifts ( table 1 and figure [ fig : col_cols ] ) .",
    "the colour selection effectively selects model galaxies and avoids the majority of low redshift objects - except at @xmath12 where the high redshift galaxies display similar colours to the des simulated data and colour selection may be problematic .",

    "our method for targeting potential massive high redshift galaxies for further study will be to initially select sources in the low contamination fraction region of our colour selection window - those with very large colours in the two bluest bands ( g - r , r - i and i - z at @xmath80 and 6 respectively ) . if these high priority sources are not confirmed as massive high redshift galaxies , we will move to colour selection regions with higher contamination fractions . in practice",
    "this will limit the number of contaminating sources which are targeted with follow up observations .",
    "we shall also prioritise sources with nir detections in the vhs and viking data , and nir colour consistent with high redshift galaxies ( r - k@xmath60.5 at @xmath81 ) .",
    "if non - detected in the nir data sets , we shall prioritise on absolute optical magnitude .",
    "follow up observations are likely to consist of deep nir observations to further rule out contaminating sources and constrain galaxy masses , as well as spectroscopic confirmations of redshifts . while spectroscopic campaigns with be relatively time intensive ,",
    "prioritising candidate selection will allow us to efficiently follow up highly likely high redshift targets .",
    "for example , using an 8 m class telescope , @xmath58 continuum detections of a r=23mag galaxy can be obtained in 4h , with likely detections of lyman-@xmath82 in just @xmath151h ( assuming typical lyman-@xmath82 line strengths from @xmath81 sources ) . assuming a contamination fraction of @xmath83 for priority 1 targets",
    ", we would able to follow up ( and confirm ) a representative sample of potential massive high redshift galaxies in just tens of hours .",
    "colour selection criteria applied to the musyc data ( assuming musyc v - band magnitudes as a proxy for des g - band magnitudes and converting our colour selections to the musyc filters ) .",
    "coloured points display sources which would be selected using our colour selection criteria .",
    "red points represent sources with a best fit photometric redshift of @xmath84 ( high-@xmath7 ) and green points a best fit photometric redshift of @xmath85 ( low-@xmath7 - contaminants ) .",
    "we vary the v - r cut in the colour selection and estimate the contamination fraction for each cut .",
    "v - r cuts are displayed at the horizontal line with the contamination fraction ( for sources above that line ) displayed on the line .",
    "clearly , at redder v - r colours the contamination fraction is dramatically reduced .",
    "hence , when identifying massive high redshift galaxies in des we can select the most likely candidates by initially investigating objects with a very red colours in the two bluest bands in our colour selections ( g - r , r - i and i - z at @xmath80 and 6 respectively ) .",
    "the bulk of the musyc data is displayed as the coloured contours . ]",
    "it is also interesting to consider if relatively pristine , massive high - redshift galaxies are likely to be detected in current and upcoming near - ir surveys ( independent of a des detection ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ir_surveys ] displays the k - band magnitude limit against coverage for a sample of near - ir surveys in a similar manner to figure [ fig : surveys ] . shallow , large area surveys ( such as vhs or viking ) fall at the top left of the plot and deep small field of view surveys ( such as video and ultravista ) to the bottom right . the grey shaded region represents the parameter space in which a survey is likely to detect massive high redshift galaxies .",
    "the area required to detect massive systems is once again taken from the @xcite mass function .",
    "the magnitude limit is produced by scaling the brightest ( k - band ) @xmath13 star - forming galaxy of @xcite to that of a similar 10@xmath86m@xmath2 source ( once again assuming luminosity scales directly with mass ) .",
    "this value is representative of a likely k - band magnitude of a 10@xmath86m@xmath2 , relatively pristine , star - forming galaxy at high redshift .",
    "all surveys fall outside of the parameter space required to detect massive , high redshift systems .",
    "hence , they are unlikely to be detected in current or upcoming near - ir surveys .",
    "this also poses a potential problem in constraining the mass of our massive high redshift galaxy candidates .",
    "the shallow depth of vhs and viking surveys suggests that we may not be able to detect even the most massive high redshift galaxies .",
    "this is likely to mean that galaxies at @xmath13 and 6 will not be detected in the near - ir survey data ( as their spectrum remains relatively flat out to @xmath87 ) . as discussed previously , without the addition of near - ir data , determining our candidate sources masses will be problematic .",
    "however , at @xmath81 this may prove less of a problem as k - band data will observe long ward of the blamer break and any significant older stellar populations will be easily identifiable .    hence ,",
    "while the deep near - ir surveys will be extremely useful in ruling out low redshift contaminating sources in out sample , further near - ir and spectroscopic follow up may still be required to determine our sources masses and redshifts .",
    "while many possible progenitors of giant elliptical galaxies have been proposed ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , each produces difficulties when reconciled with the observable properties of giant elliptical galaxies in high density environments .",
    "these systems formed the bulk of their stars in a brief star formation episode at @xmath13 @xcite and their high metallicities ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest they have undergone many successive stages of star formation in a short time @xcite .",
    "a relatively untested method for the production of giant ellipticals is that massive relatively - pristine starburst galaxies formed in the high redshift universe which subsequently passively evolved to the current epoch . these systems may be considered as either a scaled up version of lbgs or sub - mm galaxies without high dust contents ( or possibly sub - mm galaxies which have yet to produce their dust ) . in this model",
    "a massive starburst event occurs lasting for a brief period of time until star formation is quenched by some form of feedback ( @xmath9 agn feedback ) or starved by the lack of molecular gas .",
    "these galaxies would not require the destruction of dust grains invoked in formation models involving sub - mm galaxies and also do not require the dry mergers of lbg models ( see section [ sec : lbgs ] ) .",
    "systems such as this may be produced through amplified star - formation in more normal star - forming galaxies inducing a period of quasi - exponential mass growth @xcite .",
    "this star - formation period is then quenched and the system passively evolves .",
    "the non - detection of these systems to date is unsurprising , given their possible low number densities ( if similar to giant ellipticals in the local universe ) and relatively faint magnitudes .",
    "existing surveys have either been too shallow ( _ e.g. _ sdss ) or have too small a field of view ( @xmath9 sdf ) to identify massive , non - dusty , high redshift star forming galaxies .",
    "hence , these possible progenitors of giant elliptical galaxies have been relatively uninvestigated",
    ". des will provide a unique opportunity to identify such systems , should they exist and will provide the first viable candidates for spectroscopic follow up . if massive , non - dusty , high redshift star forming galaxies",
    "are identified they will set stringent constraints on galaxy formation models . however , if no convincing candidates are found in the entire des survey volume then these systems are unlikely to exist .",
    "the currently most advocated progenitor of giant elliptical galaxies are high redshift sub - mm selected galaxies ( smgs _ e.g _ * ? ? ?",
    "these systems display similar clustering scales to low redshift ellipticals , they are massive ( m@xmath88m@xmath2 ,",

    "these intense starbursts may also provide the successive stages of star formation needed to produce large metallicities in just a brief period of time .",
    "however , sub - mm galaxies are generally found at lower redshifts ( @xmath90 ) than the formation epoch of giant ellipticals suggested by their stellar histories . while this may be a selection effect ( and recently sub - mm sources",
    "have been detected at higher redshfits , @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still difficult to reconcile the observed number densities of higher redshift ( @xmath84 ) sub - mm galaxies and low-@xmath7 giant ellipticals .",
    "could higher redshift precursors to sub - mm galaxies be observed by des as relatively - pristine , massive , starbursts in the early universe ?",
    "in addition , sub - mm galaxies ( by the nature of their detection ) contain large dust contents ( m@xmath91m@xmath2 , _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which must be removed or destroyed as they evolve to @xmath92 .",
    "the main process for the destruction of dust is thought to be in supernovae ( sne ) driven shocks ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "however , this must not be the case if sub - mm galaxies are the precursor of giant elliptical galaxies , as star formation ( and hence sne driven shocks ) must cease after a brief period of time in order to produce the observed stellar histories in low redshift ellipticals . while other methods for the effective destruction of dust grains have been proposed ( clemens et al . 2010 ) , it is still not conclusive as to whether or not sub - mm galaxies can remove their large dust masses as they evolve to @xmath92",
    ". therefore , while sub - mm galaxies remain likely candidate progenitors to low redshift giant ellipticals it is nonetheless interesting to consider other avenues of massive galaxy formation at high redshift .",
    "an alternative scenario is that giant elliptical galaxies are formed from small starburst systems which later merge after their starburst event .",
    "high redshift star forming galaxies ( such as lyman break galaxies ) have been identified in large numbers ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are also undergoing common star burst events . due to their nature as small independent starbursts , with little molecular gas for subsequent star formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the stars produced in these systems will have a similar , brief , formation epoch .",
    "hence , star formation episodes in lbgs cease without the need to invoke agn feedback , providing possible explanation of the observed star formation histories in giant ellipticals ( @xmath93 * ? ? ?",
    "a caveat to this is the requisite of exclusively @xmath94 mergers in forming a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "if the mergers cause subsequent star formation the fossil records of such episodes would be evident in the observed star formation histories of giant ellipticals .",
    "in addition , lbgs at @xmath13 also display small dust fractions @xcite therefore , they do not require dust to be destroyed in their subsequent evolution . while this may make lbgs an attractive candidate for the progenitors of massive galaxies it still does not explain the observed metallicities in giant ellipticals .",
    "the formation and dry mergers of small starburst galaxies does not provide the successive star formation episodes required for the production of large metal fractions .",
    "in addition , we have not yet found regions which are over - dense in star forming galaxies at high redshift , with which to form a giant elliptical at the current epoch ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
    "however , if des does not detect the progenitors of massive low-@xmath7 systems ( and sub - mm sources remain undetected at @xmath18 ) then this channel for giant elliptical production gains attraction and helps explain the evolution of the mass - size relation ( @xmath9 * ? ? ?",
