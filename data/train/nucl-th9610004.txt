    "separable multipole interactions have been introduced and applied extensively for spherical , deformed and rotating nuclei .",
    "the separable multipole - multipole interactions originate from long - range correlations in particle - hole channels , and the physical meaning of these interactions has been clarified by mottelson in terms of the core polarization phenomena @xcite . on the other hand , the multipole pairing interactions originate from short - range correlations in particle - particle channels , and there are many works concerning the physical meaning of these interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions have been widely used and have been playing crucial roles in the study of nuclear structure , but theoretical foundations for the origin of such effective interactions in both the particle - hole and particle - particle channels have not been established enough from a unified physical picture . in particular , we consider that it is still an open and interesting problem to determine the proper form of the deformation dependence of the pairing interaction .",
    "it is the main purpose of the present paper to report a general prescription to derive effective interactions which are consistent with the mean potential , and we will present a unified derivation of the multipole - multipole interactions in particle - hole channels and the multipole pairing interactions in particle - particle channels on an equal footing ( preliminary reports on this subject can be seen in refs .",

    "since a nucleus can be regarded as a spatially and energetically saturated self - sustained system with a relatively sharp boundary , one can assume that the following condition , which will be called as _ nuclear self - consistency _",
    "@xcite , is satisfied quite accurately : the shape of the mean potential and that of the density are the same even when the system undergoes collective motions .",
    "the concept of nuclear self - consistency , which is much more stringent than the _ hartree self - consistency _ , has played important roles not only in describing an equilibrium nuclear shape @xcite and in deriving effective interactions for a spherical system @xcite , but also in deriving effective interactions for a deformed system @xcite , and higher order effective interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions have been applied successfully to the calculations of the properties of the low - lying vibrational states and high - frequency giant resonances , etc .",
    "it is found that the effective interactions derived by the rigorous application of the nuclear self - consistency are much more reliable than the conventional multipole - multipole interactions @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the spurious velocity dependence in a single particle mean potential , which violates the galilean invariance of the system , should be removed @xcite .",
    "it is well recognized that the velocity dependent terms affect the mass parameters of collective motions and thereby such quantities as the distribution of transition strengths and the absolute value of the energy - weighted sum - rule , etc .",
    ", become unreliable @xcite .",
    "the realistic nuclear potential in fact contains velocity dependent terms such as the bcs pairing field , @xmath4 and @xmath5 terms in the nilsson model , etc .",

    "_ developed a simple and powerful method to introduce additional interactions which restore such broken symmetries in rpa order @xcite .",
    "since then , symmetry restoring effective interactions have been studied by several authors @xcite . in this paper , by investigating the coupling between collective and single - particle degrees of freedom , and by using the concept of _ nuclear self - consistency _ and _ local galilean invariance _ of the system as important guiding principles , we will present a systematic method to derive self - consistent effective interactions in nuclei .    in sect.[sect2",
    "] , the field coupling method @xcite is applied to a spherical system with a velocity dependent potential . in this framework , we derive self - consistent velocity dependent effective interactions by estimating the coupling between the collective displacement of nucleons and the mean field . in sect.[sect3 ] , we extend the field coupling method to a deformed system and present a simple derivation of the doubly - stretched multipole - multipole and multipole - pairing interactions . in sect.[sect4 ] , we investigate some fundamental properties of these self - consistent effective interactions .",
    "it is shown to be essential to express effective interactions in doubly - stretched coordinates for restoring some broken symmetries and also for the natural description of gdr s in deformed nuclei . in sect.[sect5 ] , we report the results of numerical calculations in rpa of the gdr s of @xmath0 , the first excited @xmath1 states of sn isotopes and the first excited @xmath2 states of mo isotopes , by using the self - consistent velocity dependent effective interactions .",
    "the method to study collective motion that arises from the action of the field coupling in a system with a degenerate one - particle excitation has been well developed by bohr and mottelson @xcite . it provides a self - consistent method to construct the relevant effective interaction by identifying the field coupling as the hartree field of the interaction . based on the method , which will be referred to as the _ field coupling method _",
    ", the theory of self - consistent effective interactions in nuclei has been developed @xcite . as a result",

    "some examples of the velocity dependent field coupling were discussed in ref.@xcite in connection with the analysis of the high - frequency quadrupole modes and of the center - of - mass mode .    in a nuclear system , particle motions and collective motions are essentially coupled with each other in order to achieve self - consistency between the potential and the density distribution . if a collective mode excites in a nucleus , the positions and momenta of nucleons in the system are displaced by the mode accordingly .",
    "then the corresponding change in the nuclear density distribution gives rise to a violation of the self - consistency settled before the displacements are switched on . in this way",

    "furthermore , the total energy splitting between the k=0 and k=1 modes , relative to the average energy of these modes , becomes approximately equal to @xmath158 which is consistent to the simple classical geometrical relation explained before .",
    "in this section , we report some characteristic results of numerical calculations in rpa of the gdr s of @xmath0 , the first excited @xmath1 states of sn isotopes and the first excited @xmath2 states of mo isotopes .",
    "it should be noted here that our present calculations contain essentially only one free parameter in the following sense ; the single particle bases are constructed from the nilsson + bcs model with standard parameters ; the strengths of the velocity dependent effective interactions such as the multipole pairing interactions are fixed to be their self - consistent values when they are included ; only the strengths of the multipole - multipole interactions are adjusted under the condition that a common value of @xmath139 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 is to be adopted for all the isotopes of sm , sn and mo , respectively .",
    "since the positions of band - head states are very sensitive to the choice of the single particle energies as are generally observed in the rpa calculation of vibrational states in deformed nuclei , one can improve the fit to experiments by adjusting the single - particle energies , and further improvement can be obtained by slightly varying the strengths of the effective interactions around the vicinity of the predicted self - consistent values for each isotope .",

    "as stated repeatedly , these difficulties stem from the mixture of spurious states arising from the broken galilean invariance of @xmath71 and @xmath164 . in the following",
    "we show the results obtained by restoring the broken symmetry in two step .",
    "first , we study the effect of @xmath182 .",
    "the column b of table [ table2 ] shows that the sum rule values approach the classical values .",
    "however , from fig.[fig3 ] , we see that the centers of the resonances shift to lower excitation energies and the structure in the lower peak region reveal unnatural shape .",
    "finally we take into account @xmath183 so that the galilean invariance of the hamiltonian is restored .",
    "as can be seen from fig.[fig4 ] and column c of table [ table2 ] , the unnatural resonance structure disappears and the ewsr values keep close to the classical limit .",
    "we note that the final results of figs.[fig4]a and [ fig4]b agree quite well with the lorentzian distribution of figs.[fig4]c and [ fig4]d which fit the experimental data of photoneutron cross section @xcite .",
    "we now consider the effects of the self - consistent quadrupole pairing interaction on the excitation energies @xmath184 and the e2 transition probabilities b(e2 ) of sn isotopes within the quasiparticle rpa .",
    "the model hamiltonian is assumed to be @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction and the quadrupole pairing interaction , respectively .",
    "the single particle model space is spanned by all the nilsson states with @xmath188 for protons and @xmath173 for neutrons .",
    "the nilsson parameters are taken from ref.@xcite , and the deformation is set to be zero . to investigate the effect of the quadrupole pairing force on the @xmath189 value , the strength of the quadrupole pairing force , @xmath190 , is fixed to be its self - consistent value when",
    "it is included , while that of the quadrupole interaction , @xmath159 , is used as an adjustable parameter to reproduce experimental @xmath184 of @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "first , we adopt the pairing gaps determined from the even - odd mass differences .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath159 for the best fit obtained without ( with ) the inclusion of the quadrupole - pairing interaction , @xmath192 , is 0.92 ( 0.90 ) in units of @xmath193 .",
    "the calculated @xmath184 and b(e2 ) are plotted in figs.[fig5]a and [ fig5]b , respectively , and corresponding numerical values are given in column a of table [ table3 ] .",
    "these results show that @xmath192 is necessary and important in reproducing experimental @xmath184 and b(e2 ) values simultaneously .",
    "second , we have also performed numerical calculations by fixing the proton energy gap to be zero .",
    "this is because the proton shell is closed in sn . in this case",
    ", the adopted value of @xmath159 for the best fit obtained without ( with ) the inclusion of @xmath192 is 0.940 ( 0.965 ) in units of @xmath193 .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath184 and b(e2 ) are plotted in figs.[fig6]a and [ fig6]b , respectively , and corresponding numerical values are given in column b of table [ table3 ] , where we see better agreements with experimental data compared to the case with @xmath194 .      here",
    "we will study the effects of the self - consistent octupole pairing interaction , @xmath195 , in the quasiparticle rpa calculations of the excitation energies @xmath196 and the e3 transition probabilities of the first excited @xmath2 states in mo isotopes .",
    "the model hamiltonian is assumed to be @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the octupole - octupole interaction and the octupole pairing interaction , respectively .",
    "the single particle model space is spanned by all the nilsson states with @xmath200 for protons and @xmath201 for neutrons .",
    "energy gaps are determined from the experimental even - odd mass differences . to investigate the effect of the octupole pairing force on the @xmath202 value , the strength of the octupole pairing force , @xmath203 , is fixed to be its self - consistent value when",
    "it is included , while that of the octupole interaction , @xmath160 , is used as an adjustable parameter to reproduce the experimental data of @xmath196 in @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath160 for the best fit obtained without ( with ) the inclusion of the octupole - pairing interaction , @xmath195 , is 0.95 ( 0.97 ) in units of @xmath205 .",
    "the calculated @xmath196 and b(e3 ) from the ground state to the @xmath206 state are plotted in figs.[fig7]a and [ fig7]b , respectively , and corresponding numerical values are given in table [ table4 ] .",
    "here we see that the calculated b(e3 ) values are reduced and improved systematically by the effects of @xmath195 , although the fit to experimental data is insufficient .",
    "we have extensively applied the prescription to derive self - consistent effective interactions , needed for the unified description of the collective motions of atomic nuclei , especially to the system with velocity dependent mean potentials . as the guiding principles for this purpose",
    "we have imposed the conditions of nuclear self - consistency @xcite and local galilean invariance @xcite of the system , implemented with the simple and transparent field coupling method developed by bohr and mottelson @xcite .",
    "the nuclear self - consistency requires that the shape of the mean potential and that of the density are the same even when the system undergoes collective motions , while the local galilean invariance requires that the nucleonic velocities entering into the velocity - dependent single - particle potential should be expressed relative to the local collective flow . in the field coupling method ,",
    "the coupling between the particle motion and the collective field is identified , within the hartree approximation , as the averaged one - body field of the effective interaction which we look for , and the coupling strength of it can be fixed by the above conditions .    for the multipole",
    "collective shape oscillation modes in the harmonic oscillator potential with the monopole pairing correlation , we have derived the multipole - multipole interactions for particle - hole channel and the multipole - pairing interactions for particle - particle channel from the unified physical picture . in the case of deformed nuclei",
    ", it is shown that these interactions must be expressed in terms of the doubly - stretched coordinates so as to guarantee the conditions of nuclear self - consistency and local galilean invariance of the system .",
    "the origin of the doubly - stretched multipole - multipole interactions have already been clarified and they have found many successful applications @xcite , while the origin of the doubly - stretched multipole pairing interactions are clarified in this paper on the same footing .",
    "we have applied the doubly - stretched multipole pairing interactions to the analyses of some collective states in sm , sn and mo isotopes by means of rpa , and for the dipole mode we have also tested the velocity dependent effective interaction arising from the nilsson potential .",
    "we have seen the effects of such velocity dependent effective interactions in the recovery of the classical e1 sum rule for gdr s of @xmath0 , in the systematic reduction of the e2 transition probabilities for the first excited @xmath1 states of sn isotopes , and also in the systematic reduction of e3 transition probabilities for the first excited @xmath2 states of mo isotopes .",
    "it should be noted here that recently the doubly - stretched quadrupole pairing interaction was successfully applied also to the microscopic analysis of identical bands in superdeformed nuclei , and it was shown that the doubly - stretched quadrupole pairing interaction has several advantages compared to the non - stretched and stretched ones @xcite .    in summary , it is clarified that the self - consistent velocity dependent effective interactions play crucial roles to recover the local galilean invariance and eliminate various unphysical effects arising from the spurious velocity dependence of the mean potential . for rotating nuclei",
    ", we can apply similar prescription in order to find the proper effective interactions which faithfully take into account the effects of the collective rotation .",
    "results of it will be reported in a separate paper .",
