    "the study of topological states of matter has undergone a vertiginous growth since the theoretical prediction @xcite and the experimental observation @xcite of the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect . unlike the quantum hall ( qh ) effect , which is generated by an external magnetic field , or the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect , which requires time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) to be spontaneously broken without applying an external magnetic field , the qsh state is characterized by trs and",
    "is generally driven by the intrinsic spin - orbit ( iso ) coupling.@xcite nevertheless , it has been recently shown that in absence of spin - flip terms the qsh effect survives even if the trs is broken .",
    "this state has been dubbed a _ weak qsh _",
    "state@xcite ( or _ trs broken qsh _",
    "state@xcite ) , where the weakness refers to the absence of protection by trs . indeed ,",
    "the gap and the topological chern and spin chern numbers associated with the topological phase remain robust if the trs is broken by an exchange term @xcite or by an additional magnetic field,@xcite and there is a quantum phase transition to a topologically distinct or to a trivial phase only when the gap is closed.@xcite    an interesting open question is what kind of competition could originate in systems where there is an externally applied magnetic field in addition to intrinsic magnetic moments , which on their own would lead to the qah effect .",
    "recently , the qah effect has been studied thoroughly for several theoretical models of two - dimensional topological insulators , including hgte quantum wells@xcite and thin films of bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xcite doped with transition metal elements such as mn , fe , or cr .",
    "in addition , graphene has been proposed as a candidate for the observation of this effect.@xcite the influence of a magnetic field on mn - doped hgte quantum wells has been partially investigated in ref .  , with the aim of polarizing the mn magnetic moment to be eventually able to generate the qah effect upon shutting down the magnetic field .",
    "however , here we concentrate on aspects not considered so far . since for a certain range of parameters the zeeman coupling can have a similar effect on the landau - level ( ll ) spectrum as the iso interaction@xcite and can also lead to the ( trs broken ) qsh effect , it is interesting to explore the interplay between the usual zeeman term , which is linear in the applied magnetic field , and the non - linear effect arising from the exchange coupling with the magnetic moment of the mn atoms . in this paper , we show that within a model with a spin - conserving hamiltonian , the trs broken qsh phase occurs , and that a _ reentrant _ behavior is present for a certain range of parameters .",
    "a reentrant integer qh effect has been experimentally observed a few years ago in gaas quantum wells for filling factors between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the first ll.@xcite the phenomenon was later understood to occur due to a sequence of first - order quantum phase transitions between electron - solid ( wigner crystal or bubble phases ) and electron - liquid phases,@xcite and it was grounded on the strong electron - electron interactions that dominate the physics at non - integer filling factors . due to the self - similarity of the hall conductance curve,@xcite which displays a fractal behavior , a similar phenomenon was predicted to occur also for a second - generation of composite fermions.@xcite in that case , a series of reentrant plateaus would turn out to be quantized at the nearby fractional laughlin values.@xcite    a second possibility is to observe reentrant integer qh effects solely due to the ll structure of the system .",
    "for instance , in si / sige heterostructures , reentrant behavior can be driven at the single - particle level by varying the in - plane magnetic field while keeping the perpendicular field fixed , as to modify the ratio between the cyclotron energy and the zeeman splitting.@xcite in these systems , the crossings of the lls for spin up and spin down are responsible for the reentrant behavior of the quantized hall conductivity . for hgte@xcite and inas / gasb@xcite quantum wells , the reentrance of the hall conductivity has been used as a practical method to prove the existence of such a ll crossing and consequently the inverted order of the bands .    in this paper , we show that by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to a mn - doped hgte quantum well , the charge and spin hall conductivities may reenter concomitantly , i.e. , there can be a reentrance of the same topological phase , characterized by both its charge and spin topological invariants .",
    "this effect is caused by the nonmonotonic behavior of the ll energies due to the nonlinear dependence of the zeeman term on the externally applied magnetic field .",
    "a rich panoply of ll crossings , combined with the nonmonotonicity of the ll energies , provides us with regimes of parameters where this reentrant behavior could be experimentally accessed .",
    "quantum wells are ideal candidates for the observation of these effects , because they have a strong iso coupling and a large zeeman @xmath6-factor .",
    "we use the effective four - band model of ref .   to compute the ll spectrum@xcite together with the relevant chern numbers in order to identify the qsh state and other qh - like states .",
    "band structure calculations are performed for different values of the quantum well thickness and of the mn doping fraction to set realistic parameters for this model .",
    "we then study the ll spectra including the charge and spin hall conductivities and determine the conditions for the observation of reentrant topological phases .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect_model ] , we define the effective model that we use to derive our results . in sect",
    ".  [ sect_results ] , we compute the ll spectrum , explain the mechanisms that lead to the reentrant effects , and explore the parameter regimes for which they can be observed .",
    "we conclude by discussing in sect .",
    "[ sect_discussion ] the possibilities to resolve the reentrant effects in experiments .",
    "hgte and related materials have a zincblende lattice structure , so that the physics of the low - energy electronic bands is well described by the eight - band kane model.@xcite by using perturbation theory ( see the appendix for details ) , higher - energy bands are projected out in order to reduce this model to an effective four - band model.@xcite in this reduced model , the bands under consideration are referred to as @xmath7 , in this order . here ,",

    ", we set @xmath32 for convenience , and we set @xmath33 as the unit of length , so that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath22 all have the dimension of energy .",
    "the materials under consideration show a large zeeman effect , with land @xmath6 factors of the order of @xmath34.@xcite we therefore consider the zeeman term in the hamiltonian , with different @xmath6 factors for electrons and holes , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a rescaled zeeman parameter , proportional to the bohr magneton @xmath37 and to the @xmath6 factor @xmath38 for electrons ( holes).@xcite    in quantum wells of hgte doped with mn ( with molar fraction @xmath39 , i.e. , we consider hg@xmath4mn@xmath40te ) , the presence of mn has a significant effect on the magnetic properties of the material .",
    "it has been found that for low mn concentrations ( @xmath41 ) , the material behaves paramagnetically , so that its response to the magnetic field is nonlinear : in addition to the zeeman effect ( linear in the magnetic field strength ) , there is also a nonlinear contribution from the exchange interaction between mn ions and band states .",
    "the exchange interaction term is given by@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the exchange energies for the electron and hole bands , respectively , @xmath45 is the brillouin function,@xcite @xmath46 is an exchange parameter , with @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is an effective temperature , where @xmath49.@xcite since the electron wave function @xmath12 is a linear combination of the wave functions of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 bands , the exchange energy @xmath43 is a linear combination of the exchange energies @xmath52 and @xmath53 associated with these bands , respectively .",
    "the only contribution to the hole wave function @xmath13 comes from the @xmath51 bands , so that @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath53.@xcite for a more detailed explanation , we refer the reader to the appendix .",
    "the energy splitting due to the exchange interactions can be considered as an effective zeeman splitting , by virtue of the similarity between hamiltonians   and . here",
    ", one writes the zeeman energy as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the effective , field - dependent @xmath6 factor for the electron ( hole ) band . in the low - field limit ( @xmath56 ) , the effective @xmath6 factor is approximately constant , @xmath57 , derived by using a linear approximation to @xmath58 . in the high - field limit @xmath59 , the exchange interaction energy is almost constant ( @xmath60 ) as a function of the field , because @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and as a consequence , it depends also very weakly on the temperature .",
    "in order to derive the ll spectrum , we model the effect of the magnetic field @xmath23 by the peierls substitution : in the hamiltonian , the momentum @xmath63 is replaced by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the gauge potential , such that @xmath66 .",
    "the freedom of the gauge choice allows us to choose the symmetric gauge , @xmath67 .",
    "subsequently , we replace @xmath68 and @xmath69 by the ladder operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . these operators raise and lower the ll index by @xmath72 , and their prefactors",

    ", the two spin bands can be treated separately .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are given by the solutions to the equation @xmath74 , with the appropriate values for @xmath75 . here , the eigenvalues @xmath76 give the energies of the lls , where @xmath77 is the ll index , @xmath78 refers to the spin components , and @xmath79 distinguishes between the two solutions that exist for each spin component.@xcite for the hamiltonian that includes the ( effective ) zeeman effect , the resulting ll energies are given by@xcite    @xmath80(2\\pi\\phi )                          \\pm\\sqrt{[m+(-\\sigma d-2nb+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma\\tilde{g}^\\mathrm{eff}_-)(2\\pi\\phi)]^2 + 2na^2(2\\pi\\phi ) }                          \\quad(n\\geq1),\\nonumber\\\\    e_{+,0}&= m -(d+b-\\tilde{g}^\\mathrm{eff}_\\mathrm{e})(2\\pi\\phi),\\qquad\\qquad    e_{-,0 } = -m -(d - b+\\tilde{g}^\\mathrm{eff}_\\mathrm{h})(2\\pi\\phi),\\label{eqn_ll_ladder_zeeman}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 are the sum and the difference of the effective ( field - dependent ) @xmath6 factors given by eq .  , including the effect of the mn doping .",
    "the ll spectra presented here are computed using eq .  , where the relevant parameters have been derived numerically from band structure calculations based on the eight - band kane model,@xcite as explained in more detail in the appendix .",
    "these parameters have been computed for several values of the quantum well thickness @xmath82 and mn fraction @xmath39 . in particular , the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath39 has dramatic consequences : increasing @xmath39 leads to an increase of @xmath18 , such that it drives the system from the inverted regime ( @xmath83 ) to the topologically trivial regime ( @xmath84).@xcite    the charge ( spin ) hall conductivity in a specific bulk gap is defined as the sum of the charge ( spin ) chern numbers over all occupied lls below it . here , by virtue of the decoupling of the two spin components in the hamiltonian ,",
    "the charge and spin chern numbers of each ll are equal to the sum and difference of the chern numbers @xmath85 associated with each of the two components .",
    "these chern numbers are well - defined due to the spin - conserving nature of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the charge and spin hall conductivity expressed in units of their respective quanta , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , are computed as @xmath88 where the summation is over the occupied lls .",
    "these values are robust , even in the absence of trs.@xcite in this model , each ll contributes a chern number of @xmath72 , so that the analysis is simplified to merely counting the lls .",
    "the presented values have been verified by analysis of the edge states in a ribbon geometry ; see e.g.  refs .   for the details of this alternative approach .",
    "the absence of coupling between the two spin states has an important consequence for the qsh phase .",
    "since the qsh state may be viewed as a combination of two independent qh effects for spin up and spin down , it persists even in the absence of time - reversal symmetry.@xcite additional symmetry - breaking terms , for instance due to bulk - inversion asymmetry and rashba spin - orbit coupling , would cause an opening of a small gap between the edge states , which allows for some backscattering in the presence of impurities.@xcite        in fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](a ) , we have displayed the ll spectrum for an undoped ( @xmath89 ) quantum well with @xmath90 .",
    "this system is in the inverted regime , so that the spectrum displays a ( weak ) qsh gap , ( with @xmath91 ) , for magnetic fields up to @xmath92 , where the lls cross , at @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "in addition to the ( weak ) qsh gap , we observe several spin - filtered ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) , spin - imbalanced ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) and ordinary ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) qh gaps , and a trivial gap ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the ( weak ) qsh gap is the only gap which exhibits a helical edge state structure ; all other nontrivial gaps are chiral . within this formalism , no other inverted gaps form besides the one at @xmath98 , because the involved lls do not cross anywhere else than at @xmath99 . in contrast , a tight - binding description of a honeycomb lattice in a perpendicular magnetic field does allow for other gaps with helical edge structures at higher flux and fermi energy values.@xcite    the ll spectrum of fig .  [",
    "fig_ll](a ) shows two mechanisms that lead to reentrant behavior of the hall conductivity and spin hall conductivity .",
    "the first mechanism is illustrated for a fermi energy of @xmath100 ( lower dashed line ) , which lies just below the energy value at which the two lowest landau levels ( llls ) , i.e. , the lls with energies @xmath101 and @xmath102 , cross . holding the fermi energy fixed and increasing the magnetic field , we successively traverse the weak qsh gap with @xmath91 , the spin - filtered qh gap with @xmath103 , and the trivial gap , where @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the charge hall conductivity is @xmath104 for low and high magnetic fields , and @xmath105 for intermediate values , which characterizes a reentrance of a charge - insulating state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](c ) ) . at a fermi energy slightly above the crossing ( e.g. , @xmath106 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](b ) ) , a similar sequence is observed , but with a different intermediate state ( @xmath107 ) . in both cases",
    ", the spin hall conductivity takes the values @xmath108 , @xmath72 , and @xmath104 , and does therefore not show reentrant behavior .",
    "clearly the reentrance of the hall conductivity is caused by the structure of the spectrum around the crossing of the llls . to observe the reentrance of the charge hall conductivity ,",
    "it is essential that the derivatives @xmath109 of the two llls at the crossing differ in sign , which can happen only in the inverted regime .",
    "thus , experimental observation of this type of reentrance provides a proof that the hgte quantum well can indeed be described as an inverted dirac system.@xcite one may verify that if the signs of the derivatives would be equal , then the charge hall conductivity does not reenter .",
    "instead , we would observe reentrant spin hall conductivity .",
    "we note that crossings of the latter type are ubiquitous for higher lls ( @xmath110 ) , but they are difficult to observe due to the vicinity of other lls .",
    "however , later we will show that , under some circumstances , the crossings of the llls may also be of this type .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](d ) , we show the effect of doping ( @xmath111 ) on the ll spectrum .",
    "two effects are visible .",
    "first , the size of the ( weak ) qsh gap has decreased , consistent with the increase of @xmath18 . secondly , the energies @xmath112 of the two llls are no longer linear in the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , one of these llls shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the field . as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](d ) , this nonmonotonic lll attains its maximum for a flux value less than @xmath113 .",
    "thus , if the fermi energy is located between the energy of the crossing and that of the maximum ( e.g. , if @xmath114 , see the inset of fig .  [ fig_ll](d ) and fig .  [ fig_ll](e ) ) , the spin - filtered qh gap reenters , and the intermediate state is the ( weak ) qsh gap .",
    "thus , the system goes from a chiral , to a helical , and back to the ( same ) chiral phase again .",
    "this simultaneous reentrance of the charge and spin hall conductivity should be contrasted with the reentrant behavior around the lll crossing , where only one of them reenters , but not both .",
    "we remark that such a sequence is possible only if the intermediate phase is the ( weak ) qsh phase , and consequently only if the ll involved is one of the llls , since the higher lls are all monotonic .",
    "therefore , this behavior can not be observed in the undoped system , where the lll energies are linear .    as can be observed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](d ) , the maximum of this lll has an energy close to that of the ll crossing . the sequence of charge and spin hall conductivities is therefore affected by both mechanisms .",
    "we shall call this phenomenon _ compound _ reentrant behavior . above the energy of the crossing , the aforementioned sequence ( spin - filtered qh , weak qsh , spin - filtered qh ) is followed by the trivial gap , so that we get an additional reentrance of the zero charge hall conductivity . just below the crossing energy ( e.g. , @xmath115 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](f ) ) , the sequence of gaps is spin - filtered qh @xmath116 , weak qsh @xmath117 , spin - filtered qh @xmath118 , and trivial @xmath119 .",
    "in this situation , the two spin - filtered qh phases are _ different _ gaps , unlike the sequence above the crossing .",
    "these examples show that the rich compound reentrant behavior will appear if the crossing and the maximum of the llls are close to each other .        in order to be able to observe the reentrant effects in experiments , we study the qualitative structure of the ll spectrum as a function of the well width @xmath82 , the doping fraction @xmath39 , and the temperature @xmath120 .",
    "more specifically , for a fixed choice of parameters , we analyze whether one of the lll is nonmonotonic , and whether the llls cross . furthermore , if the nonmonotonicity and crossing appear at the same time , we determine the position of the maximum / minimum and the crossing relative to each other . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the structure of the two llls .",
    "the bottom row of fig .  [ fig_diag_reentrant_types ] displays five qualitatively different lll spectra , which distinguish the regimes as given by fig .",
    "[ fig_diag_reentrant_types](a)(c ) .",
    "these regimes are characterized as follows . for regimes ( i)(iii ) , the band gap has inverted order ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) , and therefore shows the qsh phase at zero magnetic field . in regime ( i ) ,",
    "the llls are monotonic , so that the only mechanism that leads to reentrant effects is the crossing . in regimes ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "one lll is nonmonotonic , so that we have compound reentrant behavior .",
    "these two regimes are distinguished by the flux value of the maximum , which is smaller ( ii ) or greater ( iii ) than the flux value of the crossing . in the case ( iii )",
    ", both llls are increasing at the crossing , so that we observe reentrant spin hall conductivity , as argued before . in regimes ( iv ) and ( v ) , the band gap is normally ordered ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , so that we find a trivial phase at zero magnetic field .",
    "in this situation , the llls do not cross , and the only mechanism that can lead to reentrant behavior is the presence of a nonmonotonic lll , as is the case ( iv ) . for regime ( v ) , both lll are monotonic and do not cross , thus preventing any type of reentrant behavior .",
    "let us finally comment on the ability to resolve these reentrant effects , based on the range of the fermi energies for which they are present . in order to estimate the observability",
    ", we compare this energy range to the broadening of the lls , that will cause the change of conductivity across a ll to be smooth rather than step - like . here",
    ", we consider a gaussian broadening with width @xmath121,@xcite that incorporates both ll broadening due to disorder and the smooth variation of the fermionic filling function at finite temperatures .",
    "the broadening due to disorder has a field - dependent width @xmath122 , where @xmath123@xmath124 and @xmath125.@xcite the thermal broadening is approximated by a gaussian with width @xmath126 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ll](b , c , e , f ) , we illustrate the smooth transitions of the conductivities due to the combined effects of both types of broadening .",
    "we consider the compound reentrant effects displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_diag_reentrant_types](ii ) and ( iii ) to be well resolvable if the difference between the energies at the crossing and at the maximum exceeds twice the broadening width @xmath127 . indeed ,",
    "in that case , the difference between the actual conductivity values and the quantized ones in absence of broadening effects is @xmath128 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath127 is not a hard limit : variations of the quantized hall conductivity , even if they are far from the quantized values , may already be considered as a signature for a reentrant effect , for example as demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig_ll](e ) . in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig_diag_reentrant_types](a)(c ) , the different shadings indicate this distance compared to @xmath121 . in the brightest regions ,",
    "the distance between the lls is larger than @xmath127 , sufficient for the reentrant effect to be observed .",
    "we find that for @xmath129 , situation ( ii ) is difficult to observe due to the small energy difference between the lls , whereas the observation of ( iii ) is easier close to the critical doping , above which the system goes to the trivial regime ( iv ) .",
    "for the observation of the compound reentrant effects , thicker wells are favorable because the energy range where the effects appear is larger . the simple reentrant effect due to nonmonotonicity , as in situation ( iv ) , is generally present in a large energy regime and therefore its observation is less affected by the ll broadening .",
    "transport experiments with hgte quantum wells have so far concentrated on the charge hall conductivity of the system .",
    "for example , the reentrance of the charge hall conductivity has been utilized to identify the possible regime of the qsh phase.@xcite observation of the simultaneous reentrant behavior of the charge and spin hall conductivity would also require the availability of a spin - sensitive detector , e.g. , a contact consisting of a tunneling barrier and a ferromagnet.@xcite however , this technique has the drawback that it only works at low fields , within the hysteresis range of the ferromagnet .",
    "another detection mechanism could be a local magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) experiment,@xcite although this measurement would be difficult due to the small bandgap of the semiconductor .",
    "the inverse spin hall effect may provide a way to measure the spin polarization of the edge states.@xcite nevertheless , the measurement of the charge hall conductivity at multiple fermi energies together with knowledge of the structure of the spectrum may provide indirect evidence for the existence of these reentrant effects .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the nonmonotonic behavior of the lls in the presence of mn doping leads to reentrant topological phases , and that the vicinity of ll crossings leads to rich compound reentrant behavior .",
    "five different qualitative forms of the structure of the llls were shown to occur in the parameter space characterized by mn doping , well thickness , and temperature .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated the effects of ll broadening to estimate the ability to resolve the reentrant effects in experiments .",
