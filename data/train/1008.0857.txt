    "at @xmath0 , strong overdensities of star - forming galaxies have been found around qsos and radio galaxies , and thus , qsos have been thought to trace highly biased regions in which the present - day massive galaxy clusters formed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is expected that this extends to the most luminous @xmath6 qsos as well , as this rare population hosts supermassive black holes of several billion solar masses that are presumed to reside in the most massive galaxies and dark matter halos present at this redshift .",
    "however observational results to date have been puzzling ; five @xmath6 qso fields observed by the hst / acs show no major enhancements in the galaxy density @xcite . even though a few qso fields have showed an apparent overdensity @xcite ,",
    "none of them were among the richest structures discovered to date at @xmath6 , as evidenced by much larger overdensities found in random fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * see overzier et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for a discussion ) .",
    "why do qsos suddenly appear to stop being at the center of the overdensity at @xmath6 ?",
    "one hypothesis is that despite the higher dark matter densities near the qsos , the strong ionizing uv radiation from the central qsos may prohibit the condensation of gas thereby suppressing galaxy formation around the qsos @xcite .",
    "an alternative and perhaps more likely explanation is that the lack of overdensities identified is related to the fact that it is currently technically challenging to perform a survey deep enough to detect faint @xmath6 galaxies and cover an area large enough to probe the large - scale structure surrounding the qsos .    in this work , we aim to study the large scale structure around the currently most distant qso at @xmath7 , taking advantage of the large aperture of the 8.2 m telescope `` subaru '' located on maunakea observatory and the wide field prime focus camera `` suprime - cam '' ( 34@xmath827 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have recently installed new red - sensitive fully depleted ccds on the suprime - cam @xcite , allowing us to reach necessary depths in much shorter exposure time .",
    "improved sensitivity is a factor of about 1.4 and 2 better in the @xmath9-band and at @xmath10 , respectively .    throughout the paper , we use @xmath11 km",
    "s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we observed the field surrounding the most distant qso , cfhqsj2329 - 0301 at @xmath7 , @xmath15 @xcite using suprime - cam with the filters @xmath16 during an engineering run in aug 2008 and uh time in jun 2009 .",
    "we used the special @xmath17 band filter constructed by @xcite .",
    "this filter covers the redder side of the @xmath9 band and has a central wavelength of @xmath18 ( fig.[fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "the seeing was stable throughout the runs , with a fwhm @xmath19 arcsec in @xmath20 , @xmath21 arcsec in @xmath9 and @xmath22 arcsec in @xmath17 .",
    "the exposure times were 360 and 500 s in @xmath20 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the exposure times in the @xmath9 band varied ; we obtained 3 exposures of 100 s , 2 of 300 s , 3 of 400 s , 6 of 500 , and 2 of 700 s resulting in more than 10000 adu of sky counts .",
    "the total exposure time in @xmath24 and @xmath17 were 3,600 s on aug 28 2008 , 6,900 s on 2 , aug 27 and 12,532 s on aug 27 2008 and jun 18 2009 respectively , under good seeing conditions ( less than 0.6 arcsec fwhm ) .",
    "our dither strategy consisted of five or more pointings on a circle of 1 arcmin radius .",
    "our reduction procedure follows @xcite , with small adjustments made related to the new ccd .",
    "a major difference between the old and new suprime - cam is that the latter has 4 channel read out circuits for faster readout . as a result",
    ", over - scan subtraction and background sky - subtraction should be performed on each channel individually for each ccd .",
    "an overscan value is evaluated by taking the mean along the columns of the overscan region of each channel , and then subtracted from the science region .",
    "a flat field image is created by taking the median of all science images after masking objects .",
    "the background sky is subtracted on each channel after flat fielding . to estimate the background , we first reject data points having 2 times larger or 4 times lower sigma value than the sky value .",
    "the upper cut prevents astronomical objects from contaminating the sky , while the lower cut removes residuals from the flat - fielding .",
    "then , we estimate the modes in 64 pixel @xmath8 64 pixel boxes . a background of each pixel is estimated by interpolating these mode values at vertexes of a triangle centered on the pixel . before combining all the science frames ,",
    "the images need to be corrected for ( 1 ) geometric distortion , ( 2 ) displacement and rotation of each ccd from the fiducial position , and ( 3 ) pointing offsets between exposures .",
    "we corrected for these effects by minimizing the positional differences of common control stars identified on each ccd in all exposures relative to the first exposure .",
    "the resulting positional error of the control stars from the fiducial point is approximately 0.5 pixel ( rms ) .",
    "we solve the transformation among the 3 bands , aligning each frame with the first exposure of the @xmath17 band in order to perform multi - band photometry using an aperture as small as possible to obtain a high s / n ratio .",
    "flux offsets are also calculated during this procedure .",
    "since we want to determine the transformation among the bands as accurately as possible , an image warping procedure was performed only once , and a second order bi - linear interpolation was used for rebinning . for stacking , we adopted the clipped mean in order to eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "the implementation of these reduction steps were performed using the software suite _",
    "photometric calibration is performed by comparing stars in a reference field 2 deg away to the north @xmath25 with those in the sdss / dr7 star catalog @xcite and using the following equations : @xmath26 these equations are determined from @xcite and convolved with response curves that include both optics and the atmosphere .",
    "we measured the efficiency of the new ccds in @xcite . since the calibration field was observed soon after the completion of our science exposure , no airmass / atmospheric corrections were needed to obtain the photometric zero - point .",
    "after the correction , the rms of the magnitude differences between our catalog and the sdss catalog are 0.06 , 0.07 and 0.07 in @xmath24 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we have checked the colors of a sample of star - like objects selected according to class_star>0.9 , by comparing the color of the stars from @xcite to the observed ones , confirming a good internal consistency of colors in our catalog .",
    "the template and observed colors were consistent within an accuracy of 0.05 mag .",
    "since the seeing in the final images are is 0.58 , 0.54 and 0.50 arcsec ( fwhm ) , we use a small aperture to perform photometry to obtain a better s / n ratio .",
    "following @xcite , who used an aperture size twice that of psf , we adopt a 1.2 arcsec aperture to perform photometry .",
    "the 3 sigma limiting magnitudes within this 1.2 arcsec aperture are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( ab ) mag . here , 1 @xmath30 sky magnitudes are computed by randomly placing a 1.2 arcsec aperture in the blank ( sky ) part of each image @xcite .",
    "we obtain an astrometric solution by comparing our catalog with the usno - b1.0 catalog ( see _ scamp _",
    "the resulting accuracy of the astrometric solution is 0.5 arcsec ( rms ) .",
    "note that we did not use this astrometric solution to stack individual raw images , but only to obtain the final absolute positions of the objects .",
    "the object detection is performed by sextractor 2.3.2 .",
    "we constructed a detection image , the `` all''-@xmath17 image , by combining all science frames , including those with a slightly poorer seeing conditions .",
    "the object detection reliability using this `` all''-@xmath17 image is higher than when only using the @xmath17 image for detection given that @xmath31 sources in the @xmath17 image are detected at @xmath32 in the `` all''-@xmath17 image . using the `` all''-@xmath17 image",
    ", we consider an object detected if it has more than 5 connected pixels with each exceeding the local sky rms by a factor of 2 .",
    "to reduce contamination by false detections , we only use the `` detected cleanly '' and `` no blending '' objects that have flags=0 in sextractor .",
    "we measure the magnitudes in 1.2 arcsec apertures for each pass - band to derive colors of the detected objects , and adopted mag_auto as our estimate for the total @xmath17 magnitude .",
    "objects in the @xmath20-band fainter than 2 sigma were replaced by the 2 sigma limiting magnitude as an upper limit .",
    "in addition , all objects having detections in the @xmath9-band of less than 2 @xmath30 were rejected in order to keep spurious detection at a minimum .",
    "some lower s / n regions , such as the `` blooming regions '' ( the halos and horizontal spikes surrounding bright stars ) , as well as the outer edge of the image , are masked manually .",
    "the resulting effective field of view is 0.219 deg@xmath33 .",
    "we detect 48,632 objects after masking ( to a limiting magnitude of 25.46 , or 3.7 sigma detections on the `` all''-@xmath17 image ) .",
    "the number of detections is comparable to that in our comparison field , the subaru deep field ( sdf ) , which contains 45,405 objects in a single field of view of the suprime - cam @xcite .",
    "we have upgraded the ccds of the suprime - cam to red - sensitive ones , which have 1.4 and 2 times better sensitivity in @xmath9 and @xmath23 compared to the previous detectors .",
    "thus , we can reach the necessary depth in much shorter exposure time .",

    "we computed @xmath34 colors of model galaxies ( 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 gyr of age , using @xcite ) and added the absorption effects from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium . according to our modeling , colors of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be used to identify galaxies at @xmath41 ( fig .

    "[ fig : colorcolor ] predicts that galaxies at @xmath2 should have a large color difference of about @xmath46 .",
    "however , for an object having @xmath47 this would require @xmath48 mag , much fainter than our detection limits .",
    "therefore , we slightly loosen the color cut and require @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these relaxed criteria are still appropriate for selecting lbgs at @xmath35 , although we must be somewhat cautious of potential galaxies at @xmath51 having colors of @xmath52 that could make it into the sample as well . in order to assess the impact of this effect on our conclusions , in section [ redgalaxies ] below we will try to statistically estimate the number of such @xmath53 interlopers expected .    in our control field ( the sdf ) , only a single object was found that satisfied our color criteria , and this object was classified as a genuine @xmath6 galaxy by @xcite . because the sdf data are deeper than ours , we adjusted the depth of that field by replacing the magnitudes of all objects fainter than our limits with the limiting magnitudes as computed for our field .",
    "we also removed two objects brighter than @xmath54 since such objects are too bright to be at @xmath2 ( according to a @xmath6 lbg study in the sdf , there is no @xmath1 galaxy brighter than @xmath55 , see @xcite ) .",
    "these two objects may be contaminating stars since they have sextractor class_star values greater than 0.95 , meaning that they are likely to be unresolved .    as a result , to the magnitude limit of @xmath56 , we have detected 7 objects that are good candidates for being @xmath6 lbgs .",
    "these objects are shown as red squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorcolor ] .",
    "note that the ( lower limits on ) their @xmath57 colors are bluer than expected from the models , due to the relatively shallow limiting magnitude in @xmath20 .",
    "because we are selecting very faint objects , our sample may be contaminated by false detections due to background fluctuations . to evaluate the number of such contaminations",
    ", we created a negative of the `` all''-@xmath17 image , and repeated our detection , photometry and masking routines on each of the filter images .",
    "no detections were obtained based on this negative image .",
    "we conclude that our catalog is not affected by spurious detection .      as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorcolor ] , l / t dwarf stars also satisfy our adopted color cut ( @xmath49 & @xmath40 ) . in this subsection , we estimate the expected number of l and t dwarfs , given the size , depth and galactic position of the field .    as a first test ,",
    "when we applied our color criteria to the sdf only one object was found and classified as a genuine @xmath6 object ( see above ) .",
    "the second reddest object in the field has @xmath58 , i.e. , there are no stellar - like objects in the sdf with colors red enough to make it into our selection .",
    "however , we need to take into account the different galactic latitudes of our field and the sdf .",
    "unfortunately , the late - type star counts as a function of galactic position are not accurately known at the faint magnitudes we are probing .",
    "late - type stars having similar colors to high-@xmath59 galaxies can only be distinguished by using deep spectroscopic observations .",
    "the latest estimate was performed by , who studied the contamination from l , t dwarfs by modeling the spatial distribution of late type stars in the galactic thin disc described using an exponential law @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number density of @xmath37-type stars , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the scale length and the scale height of the exponential disc and @xmath64 is the distance to us in galactic coordinates , @xmath65 .",
    "the adopted parameters are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "local spatial densities of late type stars are adopted from a compilation given in , while relations between the type and absolute magnitude are taken from @xcite . according to this model calculation",
    ", we expect 1.5 times as many l / t dwarfs as in the sdf for @xmath69 mag , corresponding to the faintest bin of the magnitude of our selected objects .",
    "we have seen that there were no stars in our @xmath43 color - selection in the sdf . here",
    "we try to scale that null detection in the sdf to our field .",
    "if we assume that stars follow a poisson distribution , the expected number of l / t dwarfs in the sdf is 0.40 per field at a 68% confidence level . using the galactic scaling computed above",
    ", we expect that the probability of finding two or less stars in our field is @xmath70 .",
    "given that we have already rejected two stellar like objects ( @xmath712.5 ) , the chance of finding one more star is less than two% .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is little chance that our @xmath4 lbg catalog is contaminated by stellar objects .",
    "we note , however , that object with i d 1 could be a dwarf star since its @xmath36 color is not large enough .",
    "we will include this object in the following discussion .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we found only one object when applying our adopted color criteria for z@xmath56.4 galaxies to the sdf catalog ( after adjusting the limiting magnitudes to ours ) , and this object was identified as a @xmath6 object given that its @xmath73 magnitudes were too faint for a low-@xmath59 interloper . based on this ,",
    "the expected number of @xmath72 galaxies found according to our criteria should be close to zero with an upper limit of 1.83 at a confidence level of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "although cosmic variance should ideally be taken into account as well , we do not have any other suitable comparison fields that are as deep in @xmath17 as the sdf .    however , we use the publicly available sxds dr1 catalog @xcite to obtain a rough estimate of the expected contamination using only a @xmath75 color cut .",
    "the sxds covers 5 pointings with the suprime - cam , and thus , the cosmic variance is less of a concern .",
    "we first applied again the observational limits as given by our field by replacing all magnitudes that are fainter than our limiting magnitudes ( @xmath76 ) by our 2@xmath30 upper limits .",
    "we used flag=0 in order to select only cleanly detected objects , and trimmed a region of lower s / n ( 500 pixels from the edge of the field ) . only 3 objects",
    "were found that passed the selection criteria in all 5 pointings of the sxdf .",
    "these objects are detected in the @xmath77 band ( brighter than 28.4 , @xmath78 mag ) , indicating that they are most likely low redshift interlopers at a redshift of @xmath72 .",
    "if we scale this number to the area of our single pointing field , only 0.6 of such interlopers are galaxies are expected in our .",
    "this rough estimate is consistent with the estimate derived above based on the sdf , suggesting that the contamination from @xmath72 galaxies is negligible .",
    "[ fig : numbercount ] shows the number counts of all detected objects , as well as those of the @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "the number of all objects in this field is slightly lower , by about @xmath79 , than those detected in the sdf field at @xmath80 .",
    "this could be due to a small difference in the absolute photometric calibrations between the two catalogs , or due to cosmic variance .",
    "if it were due to a difference in photometric calibration , a shift of 0.2 magnitude would be required to explain the difference .",
    "note that such an offset , if real , would not affect the colors used in our color selection of the @xmath81 galaxies , as the colors were checked for internal consistency using a catalog of stars .",
    "we next consider the possibility of cosmic variance .",
    "@xcite observed five suprime - cam pointings and derived the number counts .",
    "the variance in the number counts was found to amount to a factor of 1.7 among the individual pointings in the @xmath9 band .",
    "thus , we conclude that the differences in the number counts found between our field and the sdf are consistent with being due to cosmic variance .",
    "finally , we note that at magnitudes fainter than @xmath82 the difference in number counts becomes larger again , but this is simply because our data are slightly shallower than the sdf .",
    "we detect 7 objects as @xmath4 galaxy candidates using the color criteria in @xmath71 [ selection ] , while 9 objects are rejected as lower redshift objects at @xmath83 based on a @xmath42 color cut ( it would have been difficult to eliminate these objects using only @xmath36 ) . for comparison ,",
    "we apply the same color criteria to the sdf catalog after applying our magnitude limits and find only one candidate .",
    "thus the number of @xmath43 galaxies in the qso field is 7 times larger than that the sdf field .",
    "we note that if we apply a more relaxed cut based on a single color of @xmath75 ( the standard @xmath37-dropout technique ) to the reference field ( sdf ) , we still find 4 objects although 16 objects found in the qso field , implying that even with the standard @xmath37 dropout technique we find an overdensity in the qso field .",
    "the properties of the objects identified are summarized in table [ tab : objectlist ] , and we show the filter thumbnail images in fig . [",
    "fig : thumbs ] .",
    "although our data are shallower than the sdf , we have detected more lbgs than in the sdf .",
    "the result suggests that the number density of @xmath43 galaxies in this qso field is larger than that in the sdf field .",
    "such an overdensity would be consistent with the predictions from cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) that suggest that the first qsos are situated in the most prominent dark matter haloes and are surrounded by a large number of fainter galaxies . although the redshift discrimination offered by our photometric selection is not very accurate , the chance of finding a random projection of seven galaxies at @xmath84 is quite unlikely given their overall low number density .",
    "we speculate that we are seeing the most distant proto - cluster centered on a massive qso at @xmath7 .",
    ".,width=307 ]      in this subsection , we assess how significant the overdensity is .",
    "if we assume a poissonian distribution , the probability of finding seven objects when one expects one ( based on the sdf counts ) is less than 0.01% .",
    "however this is not a fair statistic since we have only one comparison field ( the sdf ) which has a similar size as the qso field .",
    "if we naively calculate the average number of counts expected from the two fields combined , ( 7 + 1)/2 , we expect 4 counts on average .",
    "the poissonian probability to find 7 objects is thus @xmath511% .",
    "however , the chance of finding one object in one field and seven in the other is much lower .",
    "this can be quantified by calculating the expected number of counts that maximizes the probability of finding seven objects in one field and one in the other .",
    "out of 10,000 monte carlo realizations we find 0.40% of such cases , i.e. , the significance of this overdensity is 99.6% .",
    "the above estimates are based on the oversimplification that galaxies are not clustered .",
    "here we evaluate our results based on the cosmic variance determined from a cosmological simulation .",
    "the expected number of galaxies is predicted from the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of @xcite .",
    "the simulated galaxies have appropriate colors and magnitudes , allowing us to make a direct comparison to our observation .",
    "in order to simulate galaxies at @xmath85 , we have applied ( i ) a bright magnitude cut at @xmath86 , and ( ii ) a detection completeness .",
    "then , we count how many galaxies would be found in the field of view of suprime - cam . to evaluate the completeness of our detection procedure as a function of magnitude , we add artificial objects to the @xmath17 image with all detected objects masked .",
    "the artificial objects are modeled by a moffat function with a half light radius of 0.9 arcsec in the magnitude range of 24 to 25.46 .",
    "we used the iraf task `` noao.artdata.mkobjects '' for this procedure .",
    "then , we repeat the object detection and measure the success rate .    after applying the completeness and magnitude cuts to the simulated data , we have a realistic sample that can be compared to our observational data . by randomly sampling the suprime - cam size field of view from the simulation , we measured the galaxy frequency distribution ( fig .",

    "the difference between the low-@xmath59 and high-@xmath59 environments of agn perhaps stems from the different halo masses that host them . due to the flux limited nature of observational surveys , high-@xmath59 qsos",

    "figure [ fig : simdistribution ] shows the ( projected ) spatial distribution of strongly clustered dark matter halos associated with a protocluster at @xmath106 .",
    "this protocluster is the progenitor of the most massive cluster found in the _ millennium - ii _",
    "simulations , and corresponds to a @xmath101 @xmath102 cluster when evolved to @xmath103 .",
    "figure [ fig : simdistribution ] shows , at least qualitatively , that we may expect significant enhancements in the density of the galaxies that are hosted by the dark matter halos shown , provided that qsos indeed trace protoclusters .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the surface density of @xmath59-dropout galaxies near qsos expected in the simulations is needed for a proper comparison .",
    "next , we compare our finding of an overdensity of lbgs around a qso at a characteristic scale of 3 mpc to spectroscopic measurements of hii regions around qsos .    it has been demonstrated through spectroscopic observations that there exist large , ionized regions around luminous qsos .",
    "these are sometimes called hii regions , stromgren spheres , or highly ionized near zones . in this work",
    ", we will refer to them as hii regions . in order to define the size of the hii region , @xcite proposed a definition as a point in the spectra where the ly@xmath92 transmission first drops to @xmath107 for spectra binned in 20   pixels . the cfhqs j2329 - 0301 transmission drops at @xmath107 first at 3.6 mpc , then again at 6.3 mpc @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the size of this spectroscopically measured hii region is comparable to the possible ring shape distribution of lbgs around cfhqs2329 - 0301 ( fig . [",
    "fig : spatial ] ) . note that the size of the spectroscopic hii region is expected to be larger ( @xmath510 mpc ) for the sdss qsos due to their higher luminosities ( they are brighter by by @xmath108 mag ) .",
    "in addition to the small fov of hst / acs , this may be an additional reason , why no significant overdensity of lbgs has been found around sdss qsos . to observe an overdensity of galaxies at a scale of @xmath10910 mpc ( such as expected around the luminous sdss qsos at @xmath6 ) , one needs multiple fovs even with the suprime - cam .",
    "we conclude that the size of the hii region is consistent with the apparent lack of lbg candidates closest to the qso .      if our detection of the lack of lbgs near the qso is real , then , what created the observed paucity of galaxies within 3 mpc from the qso ?",
    "one possibility is that the intense emission of ionizing radiation associated with qsos ionizes the surrounding igm and may even photo - evaporate the gas in neighboring dark halos before it has the opportunity to cool and form stars . in this scenario ,",
    "qsos would suppress galaxy formation in their vicinity .",
    "one would then observe a paucity of galaxies near a qso despite the underlying excess of dark matter halos .",
    "@xcite presented the first theoretical simulations of the gas dynamics coupled with radiative transfer , showing that an ionizing source that emits 10@xmath110 photons s@xmath12 ( appropriate for a qso ) can indeed photoevaporize minihalos of @xmath510@xmath111 ( that would have been able to form small galaxies ) on 100150 myr timescales ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . compared with our observational results of finding a `` ring''-shaped distribution of lbgs",
    ", the central qso may have suppressed the formation of surrounding galaxies thereby creating a paucity of galaxies in its vicinity but still having an overdense region beyond the inner , ionized region .",
    "this may explain the observed results , at least qualitatively .    however , @xcite quantitatively estimated that such uv radiation from qso can suppress galaxy formation or not . according to their simulation",
    ", qso uv radiation can suppress star formation in a halo with @xmath112 , while a halo with @xmath113 is unaffected .",
    "although mass estimate of our @xmath4 lbg are uncertain because we do not have deep near - infrared data , considering bright magnitude , they are likely to be massive galaxies with @xmath114 . if so , qso uv radiation is not strong enough to create the central deficit we observed .",
    "can we find other theoretical predictions that could explain the observations ? .",
    "the simulation of @xcite assumed star formation in spherical dark matter halos .",
    "they found that the impact of photoionization is greater if that star formation is taking place in a disk or in substructures ( which is perhaps likely to be the case ) .",
    "if the qso formed at a much earlier time than the surrounding galaxies , this scenario might be able to suppress the formation of galaxy seeds at the time when their masses were still sufficiently small .",
    "another plausible scenario is that the igm surrounding the qso may have been ionized by galaxies long before the qso turned on .",
    "it has been suggested that because luminous qsos are expected to form in rare overdense regions , the surrounding igm had already been pre - ionized by galaxies @xcite .",
    "according to the simulation of @xcite , the neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath115 , near a qso is estimated to be @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , qso radiation is emitted into a substantially pre - ionized igm . in this case , galaxies that formed before the qso started emitting its strong uv radiation may still be present in the vicinity of the qso .",
    "because such galaxies are likely to have ceased their star formation , they would not be detected by our lbg technique . in an overdense region ,",
    "the qso host galaxy is likely to be the most massive galaxy that formed the earliest . according to @xcite , qso host galaxies experiencing rapid star formation at a rate of @xmath53000@xmath117 yr@xmath12 combined with the radiation field emitted by the qso itself can produce enough photons to ionize a large hii region . in order to check whether we see any evidence for the presence of such a massive host galaxy",
    ", we have performed a careful psf subtraction on our images .",
    "the residuals indicate the detection of a large host galaxy by sed fitting ( @xmath118=11kpc , @xmath119 ) associated with the qso cfhqs j2329 - 0301 @xcite with evidence of extensive star formation based on its extended rest - frame uv flux .",
    "the presence of a massive host galaxy may thus support a scenario in which the qso and its host galaxy evolve together , suppressing galaxy formation in their vicinity .",
    "alternatively , it has also been suggested by @xcite that in order to facilitate the formation of a supermassive black hole by @xmath6 in the first place , it may be required to have a rare pair of dark matter halos in which the intense uv radiation from one halo prevents fragmentation of the other , so that the gas collapses directly into a supermassive black hole , and explaining the lack of galaxies forming in its vicinity as observed in our field .",
    "consistent with this scenario , it is interesting to note that we found a second qso candidate located near the eastern edge of the field ( see @xmath714.4 ) .",
    "we speculate that this could be a qso associated with the adjacent ( second ) halo that ionized the original halo .",
    "last , it has been suggested that a @xmath6 qso is likely to have experienced multiple mergers in order for its black hole to grow to a mass of @xmath120 .",
    "an example of this scenario is given by the simulation of @xcite , which predicts that the host galaxy of a @xmath6 qso may have experienced seven mergers with mass ratios of 4:1 or greater ( see their fig .",
    "the qso in our field may thus have merged with all the galaxies in its direct vicinity , explaining the peculiar spatial distribution that we find .",
    "this is also consistent with the discovery of the large host galaxy associated with the qso @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "although our detection of substructure in the lbg distribution near the qso is rather weak ( @xmath121 ) , studies of the spatial distribution of lbgs around qsos at @xmath6 are very important for testing numerous of the interesting physical scenarios related to the co - evolution of qsos and galaxies as discussed above .",
    "therefore , it is important that our conclusions are verified using deeper , multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopic observations that may detect additional galaxies missed by our current selection , such as galaxies that are below our ( uv ) detection limits , star - forming galaxies that are heavily obscured , or galaxies in which star formation has ceased .",
    "also , it will be important to extend the analysis performed here to other fields to obtain good statistics on the typical structures associated with qsos at this extreme redshift .",
    "taking advantage of the large field of view ( 34@xmath827 ) and the new red - sensitive fully depleted ccds recently installed on the subaru / suprime - cam , we have investigated the large scale environment around the most distant qso studied to date .",
    "our findings are as follows .",
    "the number of candidate lbgs at @xmath4 is 7 times larger than that in a comparison field ( the subaru deep field ) , suggesting that the qso field hosts an overdense region .",
    "we estimate that the probability that this overdensity is a chance coincidence is less than 0.4% based on either using simple poissonian statistics , or on a comparison with a cosmological sph simulation of @xmath122 galaxies .",
    "we find evidence for a non - uniform distribution of the lbgs in a `` ring - like '' shape surrounding the qso at a radius of @xmath53 physical mpc , i.e. , galaxies are overdense around the qso , but at the same time they avoid the very center near the qso ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] and [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "a ks - test shows that the radial distribution of lbgs in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] is different from random at a 98% significance level .",
    "the distance of 3 mpc is comparable to the size of the hii region around qsos at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "possible physical explanations of such a central deficit of galaxies include the suppression of galaxy formation due to the strong uv radiation field of the qso .",
    "however , because the significance of our detection of a non - uniform distribution of lbgs around the qso is low , it is important to verify these results with deeper imaging data and/or spectroscopy .",
    "our findings show that qsos at @xmath6 may indeed be embedded in the densest regions of the early universe , provided that they are observed on significantly larger scales compared to previous studies that used the relatively small field of view provided by hst .",
