    "the excess is at @xmath9gev ) energy scale and its morphology against the distance to galaxy center is consistent with signals from wimp dm annihilation , which has motivated intense discussions about dm model - constructions and constraints  @xcite . besides dm interpretation , astrophysical origins of the excess have also been actively investigated  @xcite .",
    "for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that gamma - ray emission from unresolved millisecond pulsars is compatible with the excess and can account for at least part of the excess . and ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the excess might be comprised entirely of point sources .",
    "recently , fermi - lat collaboration published a paper  @xcite on search for dm from milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies and gave stringent constraints .",
    "however , since dwarf galaxies might have different dm density profiles from milky way halo , such constraints would be relaxed then .    in this paper , we shall exclusively consider dm interpretations . as a first step , it is natural to investigate the gev excess through annihilation channels that a pair of dm goes to two sm particles directly , such as @xmath10 and also their different combinations with some branching fractions .",
    "after all , no new particle has been found yet at the lhc , except the higgs boson .",
    "this method has provided valuable information for the favored dm mass and annihilation cross section ranges .",
    "discussions has been extended to cascade two - body decay through new mediators , such as @xmath11 and dark higgs @xmath2 , which are ubiquitous in new physics beyond sm .",
    "in particular , light mediator ( @xmath12gev )  @xcite and heavy @xmath13  @xcite cases have been investigated thoroughly .",
    "this work is intended to investigate gev scale gamma - ray excess in models where dm annihilates into a pair of heavy dark higgs ( @xmath14gev ) which subsequently could decay into multi - body final states such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a virtual @xmath18 boson .",
    "the aim is to provide the ranges of the favored dark higgs mass , dm mass and the annihilation cross section , which might be useful for particle physics model building , such as hidden sector dm models with local dark gauge symmetries .",

    "suppose @xmath118 froze out in the early universe but had decayed into @xmath1 pairs with a lifetime shorter than the age of universe . this can be easily achieved if we introduce the following interactions : @xmath121 when @xmath122 is small enough , say less than @xmath123",

    "we can not make any strong statement about the existence of dark higgs with mass close to the dm mass @xmath160gev .",
    "however dark higgs is very generic in dm models where dm is stabilized by some spontaneously broken local ( or even global ) dark gauge symmetries @xcite .",

    "it is very amusing to notice that indirect dm detection experiments can be more sensitive to such a dark higgs than the collider experiments .",
