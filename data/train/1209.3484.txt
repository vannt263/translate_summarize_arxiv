    "kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) , discovered in 1996 with _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ; @xcite ) , are the fastest variability features known till date in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "they have been observed from many neutron star lmxbs , although for a given source they are not always detected @xcite .",
    "these qpos often occur in pairs , and the twin peaks usually move together in the frequency range of @xmath0 hz . the higher frequency qpo is known as the upper khz qpo ( frequency @xmath1 ) , and the lower frequency qpo is called the lower khz qpo ( frequency @xmath2 ) .",
    "the frequency differences of these qpos ( @xmath3 ) tend to cluster around the neutron star spin frequency or half of it ( @xcite and references therein ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "the high frequencies of khz qpos point toward the dynamical timescale within a few schwarzschild radii of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "therefore , this observationally robust timing feature can be useful ( 1 ) to measure the neutron star parameters , which , in turn , is essential to understand the nature of super - dense degenerate matter ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) to probe the strong gravitational field regime @xcite .",
    "however , although many models are available in the literature , the physical origin of khz qpos is still not known ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and hence we can not yet use this promising feature as a tool . many proposed models for this timing feature have attempted to explain the frequencies @xcite .",
    "some of these models involve several general relativistic frequencies at preferred radii and the neutron star spin frequency ; in some cases beating and/or resonances among these frequencies .",
    "other models include the association of khz qpos with accretion through a non - axisymmetric magnetic boundary layer in the unstable regime @xcite ; attempts to connect the khz qpos with the trapped two - armed nearly vertical oscillations in vertically isothermal disks with toroidal magnetic fields @xcite ; attribution of the upper khz qpo profile to the radial extent of the khz qpo emission region associated with the transitional layer at the magnetosphere - disk boundary @xcite , etc .",
    "however , modeling only the frequencies gives an incomplete picture ; probing radiative transfer and further modulation processes is essential to constrain the existing models for understanding the physical mechanism giving rise to khz qpos .",
    "for example , the models based on frequencies tentatively suggest some locations of khz qpo origin",
    ". these locations could be at certain radii of the accretion disk , such as the innermost - stable - circular - orbit radius , sonic point radius , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , one needs to independently verify these proposed locations . since different energy spectral components originate from different locations , such as disk , boundary layer , corona , etc .",
    ", a connection found between a khz qpo property and a spectral component could provide this independent verification .",
    "therefore , it is essential to study the energy dependence of khz qpo properties .    in this paper",
    ", we study the energy dependence of fractional rms amplitude of khz qpos .",
    "this property is a measure of qpo strength , and hence studying energy dependent khz qpo property can be useful to probe which spectral component primarily contributes to this timing feature .",
    "this spectral connection of khz qpo has been discussed by some authors . for example , @xcite suggested that , while the khz qpo frequencies are plausibly determined at the disk , this feature is modulated at the high - energy spectral component ( e.g. , corona , boundary layer , etc . ) .",
    "it has been reported by several authors that the khz qpo fractional rms amplitude increases with photon energy at lower energies , and then plausibly saturates ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have theoretically computed the energy dependence of rms amplitude of comptonizing component variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite have demonstrated that oscillating hot thermal corona may give rise to an overall increase in rms variability with photon energy .",
    "however , the above mentioned saturation at higher energies is not observationally established for many sources due to the lack of sufficient signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) at higher energies .",
    "for example , while the higher energy data points of fig .",
    "10 of @xcite are consistent with a flat fractional rms amplitude versus energy behavior , the errors of these data points are quite high .    with this motivation",
    ", we try to measure the fractional rms amplitude versus energy behavior of lower khz qpos with improved s / n .",
    "we combine tens of lower khz qpos from the neutron star lmxb 4u 172834 , in order to improve the s / n ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we choose lower khz qpo , because this narrow qpo is more frequent and easier to detect than the relatively broad and weak upper khz qpo .",
    "we find that the fractional rms amplitude systematically decreases with energy at higher energies . in order to understand this new finding , we compare the data with models involving a blackbody+powerlaw energy spectrum .",
    "this comparison suggests that the observed behavior of fractional rms amplitude may be reproduced with a fluctuation of the blackbody spectral component .",
    "in addition , we find that the quality factor ( q ) of lower khz qpo does not plausibly depend on energy .    in   [ dataanalysis ] and",
    "  [ results ] , we describe our data analysis technique in detail and display our results , respectively . in   [ models ] , we describe the models and discuss which ones are favored . finally , in   [ discussion ] , we summarize our results and give implications .",
    "in order to study the energy dependence of fractional rms amplitude associated with lower khz qpos , we retrieved all _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) pointed observational data of the source 4u 172834 for the period of april 13 , 2000 to the end of december , 2009 ( @xmath4 ks of cleaned exposure time ) corresponding to the pca gain epoch 5 . note that gain , and hence the energy - channel conversion , has changed during the entire _ rxte _ lifetime .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to the data of a single epoch in order to make the energy dependence measurement more reliable .",
    "although even within an epoch the energy - channel conversion evolves , such changes would be negligibly small to significantly affect the final conclusion of the analysis .",
    "we choose epoch 5 , because it has the largest amount of data among all the epochs .",
    "we consider only the science event files with time resolution @xmath5s and having continuous exposure time of at least 400 s for searching khz qpos .",
    "we do not apply any filtering based on energies , pcus , xenon layers , etc .",
    "however , following the usual practice , we filter the data based on time in order to remove thermonuclear x - ray bursts , data gaps , and observed intensity increase / decrease due to instrumental effects ( especially due to start or stop of a pcu ) .    it has been observed that all the khz qpos ( which are strong and narrow ) are confined to a small portion , i.e. , lower banana , of the color - color diagram ( cd ) of 4u 172834 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that they are of the same spectral origin .",
    "the strong inter - dependence found between q - values and frequencies @xcite of lower khz qpos from 4u 172834 suggests that all the qpos considered by us are of same physical origin .",
    "these justify the combination of many khz qpos ( as mentioned in   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we follow a few steps to probe the energy dependence of lower khz qpo amplitudes . in the first step ,",
    "we collect all the significant khz qpos from the event files ( with at least 400 s of data ) using a blind search . in order to do this ,",
    "we compute a leahy - normalized @xcite power density spectrum ( pds ) using discrete fourier transform ( dft ) from each 10 s of data for a given event file @xcite .",
    "the nyquist frequency and frequency resolution of each such pds ( from 10 s of data ) are @xmath6 hz and @xmath7 hz , respectively @xcite . then all ( say , @xmath8 ) the pdss from a given event file are averaged , and we search for khz qpos in the frequency range of @xmath9 hz in this mean pds . in order to search effectively , several ( say , @xmath10 ) adjacent frequency bins are combined .",
    "the noise powers in this pds follow a @xmath11 distribution with @xmath12 degrees of freedom @xcite . for a putative peak ,",
    "we compute the single trial probability ( @xmath13 ) of occurrence for a power greater than or equal to the peak power by chance from the noise power distribution .",
    "note that we consider the peak power , and do not fit the peak with a function ( say , lorentzian ) for significance calculation .",
    "the probability @xmath13 is multiplied with the number of trials ( @xmath14 ) in order to obtain the final probability @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we use @xmath17 , i.e. , the original total number of frequency bins in a mean pds .",
    "we consider a putative peak as a khz qpo , if @xmath18 ( i.e. , at least @xmath19 significant ) .",
    "we detect tens of khz qpos from 4u 172834 using the above procedure .    in the second step ,",
    "described in this paragraph , we identify the lower khz qpos from the qpos detected using the above mentioned criterion .",
    "if twin khz qpo peaks appear in the mean pds from an event file , the identification of the lower khz qpo requires no further effort .",
    "if there is only one peak for an event file , then we consider it as a lower khz qpo , if its @xmath20 .",
    "this is because , the q vs frequency diagram of 4u 172834 @xcite clearly shows that only the lower khz qpos can have q - values greater than 40 , and all the upper khz qpos have smaller q - values . in order to estimate the q - values of khz qpos",
    ", we first use the shift - and - add technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) within each event file considering the entire pca energy range .",
    "this technique mostly corrects for the centroid frequency drift .",
    "note that such uncorrected drift makes the measured q - value smaller than the actual value .",
    "after application of shift - and - add , we fit each pds containing a detected khz qpo with a ` constant + powerlaw + lorentzian ' model ; constant takes care of the poissonian white noise , powerlaw takes care of the low frequency red noise , and a lorentzian describes the khz qpo .",
    "we obtain the best - fit centroid frequency ( @xmath21 ) and the best - fit full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) from the lorentzian component , and compute the q - value ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "then we identify the lower khz qpos using the criterion @xmath20 . from the entire @xmath4 ks of data ,",
    "40 lower khz qpos ( each from one event file ) are identified spanning @xmath23 ks of exposure time , and are considered for further analysis .",
    "these 40 lower khz qpos are now to be combined in order to study the energy dependence of fractional rms amplitude with improved s / n . however , before doing this , we perform a few preliminary analyses in the third step , described in this paragraph . in this step ,",
    "we still use the entire pca energy range .",
    "we consider non - overlapping 400-second segments from each of 40 event files with a lower khz qpo .",
    "now we collect only those 400-second segments , in each of which a lower khz qpo peak with @xmath24 ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) exists . to calculate the @xmath15 for a given 400-second segment , we further divide the segment into 40 segments of 10-second intervals ,",
    "calculate pds for each 10-second interval , average these 40 pdss , and use @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that this procedure , as well as the definitions of @xmath15 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 are given in the third paragraph of the current section .",
    "we find 173 number of 400-second segments with strong lower khz qpo peaks using the above mentioned criterion on @xmath15 .",
    "the mean of these peaks is @xmath28 hz .",
    "we also calculate @xmath29 , which is the separation between @xmath30 and the centroid frequency of an individual lower khz qpo , for each 400-second segment .",
    "we use these 173 segments , @xmath30 , and @xmath29 values for further analysis .    in the fourth step ,",
    "described in this and the next three paragraphs , we compute lower khz qpo fractional rms amplitudes for several chosen energy ranges after combining the data of 173 number of 400-second segments ( see the previous paragraph ) .",
    "we consider a set of pca absolute channel ranges 58 , 911 , 1213 , 1415 , 1617 , 1821 , 2025 , 22 - 25 , 2229 , 2431 , 2633 and 2649 corresponding to the energy ranges 2.063.68 , 3.684.90 , 4.905.71 , 5.716.53 , 6.537.35 , 7.358.98 , 8.1710.63 , 8.9810.63 , 8.9812.28 , 9.8113.11 , 10.6313.93 and 10.6320.62 kev , respectively , in order to study the energy dependence of fractional rms amplitude . we do not use proportional counter unit 0 ( pcu0 ) in this step , because the energy - channel conversion for pcu0 is somewhat different from that of the other four pcus during epoch 5 . for each energy range , we compute a mean leahy - normalized pds ( in the same way as described earlier in this section ) for each of 173 number of 400-second segments .",
    "then , we shift each of 173 lower khz qpo peaks by @xmath29 ( the value for the entire pca energy range ; see the previous paragraph ) to align them at @xmath30 , and add them together to obtain a grand average leahy - normalized pds for every energy range .",
    "now the question is whether the centroid frequencies of the khz qpos change with energy .",
    "such a change might affect our grand average leahy - normalized pds and further results .",
    "we can not check it directly for individual khz qpos , because the statistics is not often adequate to detect an individual khz qpo in a small energy range .",
    "so we check it in the following way . if we consider that centroid frequency of each of the individual khz qpos is energy dependent , then there are two extreme possibilities .",
    "( 1 ) the first possibility : the centroid frequencies of all these khz qpos either increase or decrease at higher energy in a similar way . in this case",
    ", the @xmath30 value is also expected to either increase or decrease at higher energy , since we do not recalculate @xmath29 separately for each energy range .",
    "but we find that the @xmath30 value remains the same in all the energy bands ( figs .",
    "[ pds_sat1 ] and [ pds_sat2 ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) the second possibility : the centroid frequencies of some khz qpos increase , and those of some other decrease with the increase of energy , in such a way that all the @xmath30 values at various energy ranges remain the same . in this case , although the centroid frequency would not change , the width of the merged khz qpos ( i.e. , after applying the shift - and - add method ) is expected to systematically increase resulting in a lower and lower q - value , at higher and higher energies .",
    "but we find that all the measured q - values are quite close to each other ( within the errors ) and no systematic variation is observed .",
    "the fact that both @xmath30 values and q - values remain quite similar in all the energy ranges ( figs .",
    "[ pds_sat1 ] , [ pds_sat2 ] and [ rms - qfactor - vs - energy ] ) suggests that the centroid frequencies of the khz qpos do not change with energy .",
    "the shift - and - add technique to obtain a grand average leahy - normalized pds ( mentioned above ) is a standard method to improve the s / n of khz qpos and to correct their q - value ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the grand average leahy - normalized pds for each energy range is then fitted with a ` constant + powerlaw + lorentzian ' model ( as before ) , and the fractional rms amplitude and the q - value are computed from the best - fit lorentzian parameters ( see the equation 4.10 of @xcite for a general rms amplitude formula ) .    in the fifth step ,",
    "we correct the above mentioned fractional rms amplitudes for the background levels .",
    "first , we compute the background count rate in each of the chosen energy ranges using the appropriate channel range of the corresponding standard-2 data files . in order to do this",
    ", we use the pca background model file for bright sources , and the ` ftools ' command ` pcabackest ' .",
    "then , we compute the background corrected fractional rms amplitudes ( @xmath31 ) from the uncorrected fractional rms amplitudes ( @xmath32 ) , the total count rates ( @xmath33 ) and the background count rates ( @xmath34 ) using the formula @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "apart from the energy dependence of fractional rms amplitude , we estimate how the q - value of the lower khz qpo depends on energy .",
    "this is computed from the above mentioned fitting of the grand average leahy - normalized pds for each energy range .",
    "the ratio of the best - fit centroid frequency to the best - fit fwhm of the lorentzian model component gives the q - value .",
    "here we note that while the shift - and - add technique corrects for a large error in q - value due to the centroid frequency drift , this technique also introduces a small error in q - value , because the centroid frequency is shifted without changing the fwhm .",
    "the frequencies of the 173 detected lower khz qpos , which are used to study the energy - dependence of fractional rms amplitude (   [ dataanalysis ] ) , span the range of @xmath36 hz ( mean ( @xmath30 ) = @xmath37 hz ; median = @xmath38 hz , and standard deviation = @xmath39 hz ) . in figs .",
    "[ pds_sat1 ] and [ pds_sat2 ] , the grand average leahy - normalized pdss ( see   [ dataanalysis ] ) for 12 energy ranges are shown in 12 panels .",
    "each panel is for the same exposure ( 69.2 ks ) , and in each panel the total count rate and the background count rate are mentioned .",
    "these figures indicate that , while there are visibly prominent khz qpo peaks for the lower energy bands , such a peak is not visible for the highest energy band .    in fig .",
    "[ rms - qfactor - vs - energy ] , we plot background corrected fractional rms amplitude versus energy . the amplitude increases with energy at lower energies , and systematically decreases ( seen from the overlapping energy ranges ) above @xmath40 kev .",
    "note that , if for an energy range the lower khz qpo peak is not clearly visible ( see fig .",
    "[ pds_sat2 ] ; panels with blue model curves ) , we compute an upper limit to the fractional rms amplitude at @xmath30 ( see   [ dataanalysis ] ) instead of estimating the amplitude from the best - fit lorentzian . our estimated @xmath41 and @xmath25 upper limits of fractional rms amplitude in the energy range 10.6320.62 kev are 2.37% and 3.66% , respectively .",
    "if we compare the fractional rms amplitude value ( @xmath42% ) in the 7.358.98 kev range with the @xmath25 upper limit ( @xmath43% ) in the 10.6320.62 kev range , we find a @xmath44 significant drop in the amplitude value .",
    "this quantifies the decrease of the lower khz qpo fractional rms amplitude at higher energies ( see fig .",
    "[ rms - qfactor - vs - energy ] ) .",
    "the initial increasing part of the fractional rms amplitude is fitted with a linear and a powerlaw model , the best - fit curves of which are very similar to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fit_rms - qfactor - vs - energy_extpl ] ) .",
    "this figure , with extrapolated model curves , shows that the increasing trend of lower khz qpo amplitude at lower energies can not plausibly explain the upper limit in the 10.6320.62 kev range .",
    "for example , the extrapolated fractional rms amplitude value at 10.6320.62 kev from the linear model is @xmath45 , which implies a @xmath46 significant higher value compared to the @xmath25 upper limit of the observed fractional rms amplitude .    while the fractional rms amplitude changes with energy , q - value does not ( fig .",
    "[ rms - qfactor - vs - energy ] , lower panel ) . as mentioned in ",
    "[ dataanalysis ] , while the shift - and - add technique corrects for a usually large error in q - value due to the evolution of the centroid frequency , this technique introduces a small error .",
    "this is because , while a khz qpo peak is shifted to a new frequency ( @xmath28 hz ) , the fwhm of this peak remains the same .",
    "given that the standard deviation of the centroid frequency distribution of our detected lower khz qpos is 57.8 hz and @xmath28 hz , this error can be estimated to be @xmath47% of the typical value of q @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , this error is small compared to the @xmath41 error ( which is typically @xmath49 ) from lorentzian fitting of the qpo peaks .",
    "therefore , the error due to frequency shift does not change our conclusion regarding the energy independence of q - values , and hence we do not make an attempt to correct it .",
    "this paper shows a prominent and systematic decrease of the lower khz qpo fractional rms amplitude at higher energies , for the first time to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we , therefore , try to find out if such a decrease is at all theoretical expected . for example , could certain parameter values of the usual energy spectra of neutron star lmxbs explain it qualitatively ? before testing this ,",
    "let us briefly mention the x - ray components of these sources , as we understand currently .",
    "neutron star lmxbs are believed to have two primary x - ray emitting regions , an accretion disk and a boundary layer .",
    "both these regions are expected to be optically thick , and therefore to emit blackbody radiation .",
    "furthermore , one ( or more ) of these components may be covered with a corona ( coronae ) .",
    "such a corona may reprocess ( comptonize ) the blackbody photons .",
    "the amount of reprocessing depends on the optical depth of the corona , as well as the extent of coverage ( e.g. , full versus partial ) . as a result , the observed spectrum",
    "either from the disk and/or the boundary layer can be a blackbody , or comptonized , or a sum of both .",
    "observationally , however , no spectral model usually uniquely describes the data .",
    "moreover , it is not usually clear , where various components of a given model originate from . therefore ,",
    "although many works over a few decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) support the general understanding mentioned above , the details are still unknown .    in order to have a basic understanding ( i.e. , as much as possible independent of detailed models ) of the lower khz qpo fractional rms amplitude versus energy behavior found by us , we choose the simplest two - component spectral model , which is based on the above mentioned description of x - ray components .",
    "this is a blackbody+powerlaw model , in which powerlaw usually represents the comptonized component . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have successfully fitted the continuum spectra from 4u 172834 with a blackbody+comptonization model . in order to check whether a blackbody+powerlaw works",
    ", we fit the continuum spectra of a few data files ( having prominent khz qpos ) with this model , as well as with a blackbody+comptonization ( bbodyrad+comptt in xspec ) model .",
    "we find that , not only both the models give acceptable fits , but the powerlaw component represents the comptonization component reasonably well , as verified from the respective fluxes and spectral component curves .",
    "this indicates that a blackbody+powerlaw model is appropriate for the 4u 172834 spectra .    before describing our model , here we mention and discuss the assumptions involved in our modeling and interpretation , some of them recapitulated from the data analysis side and some other extra assumptions from the model side .",
    "( 1 ) we assume that the spread in energy spectra ( e.g. , soft colors and hard colors in a color - color diagram ( cd ) ; @xcite ) and in intensity from our data files containing lower khz qpos do not significantly affect the robustness of the energy behavior of fractional rms amplitude reported by us ( fig .  [ rms - qfactor - vs - energy ] ) .",
    "this is justified because of the following reasons .",
    "( a ) all the qpos ( which are strong and narrow ) considered by us are confined to a small portion , i.e. , lower banana , of the cd of 4u 172834 @xcite , as mentioned in   [ dataanalysis ] .",
    "( b ) given the small fractional rms amplitudes ( @xmath50% ) of lower khz qpos in the 2 - 16 kev energy range , which is used to compute the cd and hid , the entire x - ray energy spectrum does not contribute to these qpos .",
    "hence a small spread in cd does not necessarily indicate different physical origin of different lower khz qpos .",
    "( c ) the strong inter - dependence found between q - values and frequencies of lower khz qpos from 4u 172834 ( along with several other atoll sources ; @xcite ) suggests that all the qpos considered by us are of same physical origin .",
    "these support the robustness of our reported rms - energy behavior .",
    "( 2 ) we assume that the energy dependence of lower khz qpos does not change with frequency .",
    "this may be a reasonable assumption , because these qpos with different frequencies are likely to have originated from the same physical process .",
    "( 3 ) our model considers the sinusoidal fluctuation of a single parameter of the above mentioned blackbody+powerlaw model .",
    "the sinusoidal fluctuation is somewhat justified , because according to some models , the original oscillations are sinusoidal , and the broadening happens because of a decoherence mechanism ( say , damping ; @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we note that a sinusoidal signal was also assumed by @xcite .",
    "we further note that , even if the intrinsic oscillations of lower khz qpos are a sum of many sinusoids originated separately , our modeling will still be useful to connect a spectral component to these qpos .",
    "( 4 ) our model does not involve any response matrix . although application of a response matrix may slightly change the model rms - energy curves quantitatively , the qualitative nature of these curves should not change .",
    "now we describe our model .",
    "as previously mentioned , the total time averaged flux ( say , @xmath51 ; @xmath52 : photon energy , @xmath53 : time ) of the source can be fitted well with a combination of blackbody ( @xmath54 ) and powerlaw ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "each of blackbody and powerlaw has two parameters : normalization ( @xmath56 ) and temperature ( @xmath57 ) for the former , and normalization ( @xmath58 ) and photon index ( @xmath59 ) for the latter .",
    "we try to investigate if sinusoidal fluctuation in one of these parameters ( while keeping the other three parameters non - fluctuating ) can reproduce the observed fractional rms amplitude versus energy behavior . here as an example , we consider the case of fluctuating blackbody temperature .",

    "we note that the blackbody flux and the powerlaw flux are nonlinear functions of @xmath57 and @xmath59 , respectively . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath57 ( or @xmath59 ) fluctuates sinusoidally ( as we assume ) , the variation of the blackbody flux ( or powerlaw flux ) will not be strictly sinusoidal , and will contain higher harmonics .",
    "here we show that this flux variation is sinusoidal ( which we assume in our modeling ) when @xmath57 ( or @xmath59 ) fluctuation is small ( e.g. , @xmath62 , for the varying blackbody temperature ) , and is therefore considered up to the first order : @xmath63 ^ 2 + s_{\\rm pl } ( e , n_{\\rm pl } , \\alpha_{\\rm pl } ) \\\\ & = & s_{\\rm bb } ( e , n_{\\rm bb } , t_{\\rm bb0 } ) + s_{\\rm pl } ( e , n_{\\rm pl } , \\alpha_{\\rm pl})\\\\ & & \\text{(which is correct up to first order in $ [ \\frac{t_{\\rm bb1}}{t_{\\rm bb0}}]$ ) } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last step is justified because the observations are several orders of magnitudes longer than the oscillation period @xmath64 .",
    "this last step shows that , @xmath51 @xmath65 ; which is simply the sum of xspec model components ( bbodyrad+powerlaw ) used to fit the time averaged spectrum . finally , note that this first order approximation is not required when normalization of blackbody or normalization of powerlaw varies .    considering the above procedure",
    ", our model fractional rms amplitude has five parameters : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath66 , the last one is the fractional peak amplitude of one of the first four parameters , which is fluctuating ( e.g. , @xmath67 in the case discussed above for the varying blackbody temperature ) .",
    "while computing the models , we consider following ranges of our parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath69 kev , @xmath70 photons @xmath71 s@xmath72 kev@xmath72 ( at 1 kev ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the formula for blackbody photon count rate per @xmath75 per kev is @xmath76 , while that for powerlaw photon count rate per @xmath75 per kev is @xmath77 , with energy @xmath52 in kev .",
    "the best - fit parameter values from our fitting of a few 4u 172834 spectra ( see earlier in this section ) , and from @xcite and @xcite are within the above ranges .    for a set of five model - parameter values , we numerically compute the fractional rms amplitude , as outlined above , systematically in each of the observed energy ranges for the sinusoidal oscillation in time of each of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for each of these four cases , we produce many ` fractional rms amplitude versus energy ' model curves for various sets of parameter values , in order to thoroughly explore if some curves for a given case can reasonably describe the data .",
    "we show some examples of these model curves in figs .",

    ", we show the example curves for various sets of parameter values ( mentioned in the figure - caption ) .",
    "therefore , these figures give an idea about the nature of energy - dependence of fractional rms amplitudes for various parameter values for the sinusoidal oscillation in time of a given parameter .",
    "the blue dashed curve in each figure appears to be the closest to the data among our computed model curves .",
    "these figures show that the sinusoidal oscillation of a blackbody parameter describes the data well , and hence the observed energy - dependence of fractional rms amplitude is expected .",
    "we note that testing this was the main aim of modeling reported in this paper , as mentioned in the first paragraph of this section .",
    "[ khzqpobbpl_bbtemp_1.ps ] , [ khzqpobbpl_bbnorm_1.ps ] , [ khzqpobbpl_plindex_1.ps ] and [ khzqpobbpl_plnorm_1.ps ] also suggest that the oscillation of a single blackbody parameter ( temperature or normalization ) describes the data better than the variation of a single powerlaw parameter ( index or normalization ) .",
    "we further note that the small value of @xmath66 corresponding to the blue dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ khzqpobbpl_bbtemp_1.ps ] satisfies the assumption of small fluctuation of the blackbody temperature , as mentioned earlier in this section .",
    "in this paper , we report the decrease of fractional rms amplitude of lower khz qpos at higher energies , for the first time to the best of our knowledge .",
    "as the count rate of neutron star lmxbs decreases at higher energies , it is difficult to reliably measure the fractional rms amplitude with _ rxte _",
    "pca ( the only instrument capable of detecting khz qpos ) due to the lack of sufficient s / n . sometimes because of this , the previous studies , to the best of our knowledge , have concluded that the fractional rms amplitude either goes on increasing with energies , or first increases and then saturates . in order to improve the s / n , we combine tens of lower khz qpos from 4u 172834 , and also use the standard shift - and - add technique (   [ dataanalysis ] ) .",
    "the net count rate of our highest energy range ( @xmath78 kev ) is also larger than that in some other energy ranges .",
    "since the @xmath78 kev range does not have any clear khz qpo peak , the decrease of fractional rms amplitude at higher energies should be real , and not a result of low s / n ( see figs",
    ".  [ pds_sat1 ] and [ pds_sat2 ] ) . note that the small uncertainties in the channel - energy conversion can not make the lower khz qpo disappear at higher energies , and hence can not produce the decrease .",
    "moreover , the gradual and systematic change of fractional rms amplitude at higher energies for overlapping energy ranges ( figs .",
    "[ pds_sat1 ] , [ pds_sat2 ] , [ rms - qfactor - vs - energy ] ) strongly supports the decrease of this amplitude of lower khz qpos .",
    "the energy dependence of fractional rms amplitude can be very useful to probe the physical origin of khz qpos ( see   [ introduction ] ) , and hence our finding is important .",
    "therefore , we use a two - component ( blackbody+powerlaw ) spectral model to gain insights ( see   [ models ] for details ) . we explore the shape and fractional rms amplitude values of many model curves , examples of which have been shown in figs .",
    "[ khzqpobbpl_bbtemp_1.ps ] , [ khzqpobbpl_bbnorm_1.ps ] , [ khzqpobbpl_plindex_1.ps ] and [ khzqpobbpl_plnorm_1.ps ] .",
    "these curves suggest that ( 1 ) the reported energy behavior of lower khz qpo fractional rms amplitude can be explained with simple models ; and ( 2 ) it is likely that the fluctuation in a blackbody - like component primarily causes the lower khz qpos . however , we consider the fluctuation of only one model parameter at a time (   [ models ] ) , and hence we can not study the effects of a simultaneous fluctuation of the two powerlaw parameters .",
    "we also note that the non - dependence of q - value on energy (   [ dataanalysis ] ) may imply that the lifetime of the oscillations is independent of photon energies .",
    "this may suggest that the lower khz qpos in various energy ranges originate from the same location , and hence from the same spectral component .",
    "but we can not constrain the location of either the blackbody or the powerlaw component from our study .",
    "the blackbody could originate either from the boundary layer or the disk @xcite .",
    "similarly , the corona , which plausibly gives rise to the powerlaw , could be centrally located near the neutron star or a cover on the accretion disk .    with our new finding ,",
    "an important question to ask would be whether the fractional rms amplitude of lower khz qpos decreases with energy ( at higher energies ) for other neutron star lmxbs as well .",
    "@xcite reported that 4u 160852 did not show any decrease in fractional rms amplitudes at energies as high as 20 kev , although at the high energy end the error in fractional rms amplitude was quite high .",
    "a larger ( than pca ) area at higher energies may be required ( 1 ) to detect a plausible decrease which happens at higher energies than that for 4u 172834 ; ( 2 ) and to reduce the errors in fractional rms amplitudes , while increasing the number of data points , in order to perform a better modeling .",
    "the upcoming space missions ( e.g. , _ astrosat _ ) having sufficient time resolution and much higher ( than pca ) area in @xmath79 kev , will be useful for this purpose .",
