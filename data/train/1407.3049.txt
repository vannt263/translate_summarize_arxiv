    "a variety of cluster states have been known in light nuclei , such as @xmath0+@xmath0 and @xmath3o+@xmath0 states in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne and @xmath4 states in @xmath5c .",
    "cluster motion in these cluster states has been theoretically investigated in details with such microscopic cluster models as the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite and the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this decade , a new interpretation of the cluster states has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . that is the dilute cluster gas state where",
    "clusters are not localized but they are rather freely moving occupying the lowest orbit in the cluster mean - field potential .",
    "one of the typical examples is the @xmath4 cluster state of @xmath5c(@xmath6 ) .",
    "a new method of cluster model has been constructed for treating the @xmath0 cluster gas state originally based on the spherical gaussian .",
    "nowadays , it is called `` tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke wave function '' ( thsr ) @xcite .",
    "the spherical thsr wave function has been extended to the deformed version @xcite , and it has been shown that , when the @xmath7-projection and the orthogonality to the @xmath5c(@xmath8 ) are taken into account , the single deformed thsr wave function is in principle equivalent to the full solution of the @xmath4 wave function obtained by rgm and gcm calculations . in this paper , we call the spherical and deformed versions of thsr , `` sthsr '' and `` dthsr '' , respectively . also in the case of @xmath1be@xmath9 ) , the exact solution of the @xmath10 state obtained by the gcm calculation can be described almost perfectly by the single @xmath10 dthsr wave function .    for the study of @xmath2ne , zhou _",
    "have introduced the generalized thsr wave function to investigate the cluster structure in @xmath11 band as well as @xmath12 band and have shown that the single thsr wave functions give the better description than the single bink - bloch ( bb ) wave function @xcite having the localized gaussian form with the fixed range parameter .",
    "in particular , for @xmath2ne(@xmath13 ) , the single dthsr is almost equivalent to the exact solution of the gcm with 99.98% squared overlap . the fact that the single tshr wave functions give better description than the single bb wave function indicates that the interpretation of the localized @xmath3o+@xmath0 cluster for the inversion doublet of @xmath12 and @xmath11 bands in @xmath2ne is too simple , but the quantum fluctuation of @xmath0 cluster position is significant as already known in the success of the gcm calculation with the superposition of many bb wave functions @xcite . in the works with the thsr wave functions ,",
    "the delocalization of clusters in @xmath2ne has been stressed and explained as the new concept of the `` nonlocalization '' @xcite .",
    "based on the success in the description of @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3o+@xmath0 systems with a single thsr wave function , the container picture has been recently proposed to understand the cluster states @xcite . in the container picture",
    ", clusters are moving in the lowest orbit of the cluster mean - filed potential whose spatial size is specified by the gaussian range parameter of the thsr wave function",
    ".    however , one should be careful to discuss physical meaning of cluster wave function , in particular , in the inner region where the cluster wave function is strongly affected by the antisymmetrization effect between clusters .",
    "moreover , the physical or mathematical meaning of the deformation of the gaussian wave function in the dthsr is not obvious , because the angular momentum @xmath14-wave relative wave function projected from the deformed gaussian shows a behavior quite different from a gaussian function when the deformation is large .",
    "as already known , in the cluster states such as @xmath0+@xmath0 and @xmath3o+@xmath0 states in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne , the relative wave function between clusters is characterized by the suppressed inner part , the enhanced surface peak , and the outer tail .",
    "the inner suppression and the enhanced amplitude at the surface can be understood by the strong antisymmetization effect between clusters .",
    "it is important that the inner nodal structure and the surface peak structure are dominantly determined by the antisymmetrization , and therefore , it is difficult to discuss the physical meaning of the original @xmath0-cluster wave function before the antisymmetrization . on the other hand , the outer tail part is almost free from the antisymmetrization effect , and it directly shows the @xmath0 cluster motion in the physical state .",
    "the outer tail is caused by the quantum penetration and its asymptotic behavior is well defined .",
    "needless to say , the quantum penetration is important in particular in the loosely bound @xmath0-cluster system with the small @xmath0 separation energy and the small centrifugal and coulomb barriers . in such a case",
    ", the wave function is slowly damping in the outer region and it has the remarkably long outer tail . as a result , the outer long tail becomes more significant , and hence , the description of the slowly damping tail part is essential for good description of the @xmath0-cluster wave function .    in that sense , it is clear that the bb wave function fails to describe the outer long tail because it has the localized gaussian form with the fixed range",
    ". the gaussian function may give the better description if the gaussian range is the adjustable parameter as in the case of the sthsr wave function .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the damping behavior of the tail part in the asymptotic region is well defined by the @xmath0 separation energy as well as the centrifugal and coulomb barriers , and obviously , it should be different from the gaussian tail .",
    "one of the questions is why the projected dthsr wave function can describe the correct damping behavior of the tail part and succeed to reproduce the exact solution almost perfectly .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the @xmath0-cluster motion in the @xmath10 and @xmath3o+@xmath0 cluster states of @xmath1be and @xmath2ne .",
    "the spinless two - body cluster systems of @xmath3o+@xmath0 and @xmath0+@xmath0 can be reduced to the one dimension problem with the relative coordinate @xmath15 between clusters . to discuss the physical feature of @xmath0 cluster motion",
    "we analyze the antisymmetrized relative wave function in one coordinate @xmath15 space , and discuss its behavior in three regions of @xmath15 , the inner part , the surface peak , and the outer tail . in the present work ,",
    "we consider several kinds of trial functions specified by one or at most two adjustable parameters and examine how accurately the trial function can reproduce the relative wave function of the exact solution obtained by the gcm calculation .",
    "particular attention should be paid on the detailed behavior of the outer tail to discuss the delocalization of the @xmath0 cluster in weakly bound cluster states .",
    "we consider the bb , sthsr , dthsr , and yt functions as trial functions .",
    "the relative wave functions in the bb , sthsr , dthsr , and yt functions are characterized by the localized gaussian with the fixed range , the spherical gaussian , the deformed gaussian , and the yukawa tail function , respectively . comparing the squared overlap of those trial functions with the gcm wave function",
    ", we discuss the quality of the description of the exact solution with those trial functions .",
    "we show that the dthsr is a good trial function which can give almost 100% overlap with the exact solution of weakly bound @xmath0-cluster states such as @xmath1be(@xmath16 ) and @xmath2ne(@xmath13 ) because the projected deformed gaussian can fit the yukawa - like tail in the outer region fairly well if the effective barrier hight in the outer region is low enough .",
    "we also demonstrate that a kind of wave function with a yukawa tail gives a good description of those states with almost the same quality as the dthsr , and it gives even better description for such states as @xmath2ne(@xmath16 ) and @xmath2ne(@xmath17 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the gcm calculation of @xmath1be and @xmath2ne is explained . in [ sec : trial - functions ] , the adopted trial functions are described .",
    "the analyses of cluster states in @xmath1be and @xmath2ne are given in [ sec:8be ] and [ sec:20ne ] , respectively .",
    "finally in [ sec : summary ] , the discussion and summary are given .",
    "the tail behavior of the relative wave function in the dthsr wave function in the large deformation limit is explained in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cluster models are applied to @xmath1be and @xmath2ne , respectively . to describe details of the @xmath0 cluster motion , we solve the two - cluster problem with the gcm using bb cluster wave functions . in the gcm framework , we can obtain the precise relative wave function between the @xmath0 cluster and the other cluster by superposing bb wave functions .",

    "such forbidden states have no physical meaning in the total @xmath20+@xmath21 system , and therefore , in discussion of @xmath0 cluster wave functions in physical states we should extract physical component of the cluster wave function by eliminating unphysical forbidden states . for this aim",
