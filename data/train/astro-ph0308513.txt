    "ngc 4151 is the nearest and brightest seyfert and it has been identified as the `` archetype '' of seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has also been called `` one of the most enigmatic '' of galaxies @xcite because the origin of the near - infrared nuclear emission component , which dominates galactic near - infrared emission , is unclear . the extent to which the observed near - infrared emission comes directly from the accretion disk or jet rather than from clouds of gas or dust that _ reprocess _ energy from the accretion disk is critical to models that attempt to unify various observational classes of agn @xcite . over the past 30 years , arguments for both thermal and nonthermal ( synchrotron ) emission mechanisms have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "evidence of @xmath2 band emission variability on 12 month timescales @xcite and weak ( 0.10.5% ) degrees of @xmath3 and @xmath2 band linear polarization @xcite can be explained by both thermal and nonthermal models .",
    "currently , the prevailing view is that the near - infrared emission is thermal and arises from the inner edge of a dust torus that is heated primarily by uv and soft x - ray emission from the corona of the accretion disk surrounding a massive black hole @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the source of the near - infrared emission would appear spatially unresolved by the largest single aperture infrared telescopes and would have low degrees of linear polarization .",
    "observations at 11 @xmath0 m @xcite strongly imply the presence of a @xmath435 pc diameter source where dust grains are heated to around 200 k and are responsible for the mid - infrared emission .",
    "estimates for the inner radius of the dust , which could correspond to the inner edge of a torus , have been as small as about 0.03 pc @xcite , with values in the 0.21 pc range presently favored @xcite . in some agn",
    "unification schemes , the torus is supposed to be optically and physically thick @xcite .",
    "the radius of the broad line region ( blr ) is about 0.01 pc @xcite , putting the smallest estimates of the dust torus inner radius very close to the black hole and accretion disk .",
    "the parent galaxy for the ngc 4151 seyfert nucleus is nearly face - on ( @xmath5 to the line of site ) and has a weak radio jet at p.a.= @xmath6 e. of n. @xcite . while the radio feature corresponding to the uv / optical nucleus has been uncertain , the candidate features contain emission knots that are unresolved on angular scales of a few milliarcseconds ( mas ) and have a surface brightnesses of a few mjy / beam @xcite .",
    "the 2mass @xmath2 band flux for ngc 4151 is 8.519 @xmath7 0.018 magnitudes , and at least 90% of the flux is contained in the central 1 arcsec @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the agn is about @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 , and a @xmath10 m@xmath11 black hole is thought to lie at the center of the blr @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we have taken the distance as 13.3 mpc ( for @xmath12 km s@xmath9 ) , where 1 mas corresponds to 0.065 pc ( 75.3 light days ) in projection .",
    "interferometric combination of the twin keck telescopes @xcite provides sensitivity to 2.2 @xmath0 m emission on angular scales of @xmath13 1 mas .",
    "our observations represent a ten - fold improvement in angular resolution when compared to previous near - infrared measurements of agn and make it possible to test the subparsec - scale , near - infrared emission models of ngc 4151 .",
    "optical / ir interferometry has traditionally been limited to relatively bright stellar objects .",
    "these observations represent the first measurement of an extragalactic source with an optical / ir interferometer .",
    "the keck interferometer combines the light from the two 10 m keck telescopes , separated by 85 m with the baseline oriented 38@xmath14 ( e of n ) .",
    "both telescopes are equipped with adaptive optics systems @xcite , which are required for @xmath2 band interferometer observations .",
    "the interferometer field of view on the sky is @xmath1350 mas in the @xmath2 band , as set by a single - mode fiber ahead of the detector ; the interferometer is not sensitive to emission outside of this field of view .",
    "the fringe tracker uses a 4-bin synchronous fringe demodulation algorithm @xcite , similar to that used at the palomar testbed interferometer @xcite . for the data presented here , the system operated at a 200  hz frame rate ( the 4-bin acquisition time ) .",
    "ngc 4151 was observed with the keck interferometer on 2003 may 20 and 21 .",
    "the data presented here are from the white - light channel ( @xmath15=2.18  @xmath0 m and @xmath16  0.3@xmath0 m ) .",
    "observations consist of a series of interleaved integrations on the source and several calibrators .",
    "each integration includes 120 seconds of fringe data followed by a background measurement .",
    "included with the fringe data are periodic measurements of the single - telescope fluxes .",
    "the data are presented as the visibility amplitude squared , normalized such that an unresolved object has v@xmath17 . on may 20 ,",
    "only limited data were collected on ngc  4151 and calibrators due to weather ; however , the source was detected and resolved on both nights , with internally consistent visibility . in the results discussed below",
    "we have used data only from may 21 .",
    "the system visibility , the instrument response to a point source , is measured with respect to the calibrator stars hip58918 , hd 105925 , and hip60286 .",
    "the calibrator angular sizes were derived by fitting photometry from simbad and 2mass . all of the calibrators have estimated angular diameters of less than 0.2 mas and are unresolved by the interferometer .",
    "the calibrator angular size uncertainty was set to 0.1 mas .",
    "source and calibrator data were corrected for biases using sky calibrations as described by @xcite and averaged into blocks of 5 seconds each .",
    "the calibration procedure includes a per - scan correction for the bias due to mismatched fluxes between the two telescopes ( which includes strehl mismatch ) using the single - telescope flux measurements .",
    "the data were then calibrated for the system visibility @xcite .",
    "the calibrated data points for the target source are the average of the 5 seconds blocks in each integration , with an uncertainty given by the quadrature of the internal scatter and the uncertainty in the calibrator size .",
    "in addition to the measurement error , we have estimated any systematic error in the calibrated visibility to be less than 0.05 @xcite .",
    "this systematic error was summed quadratically with the measurement and calibration errors .",
    "the resulting average visibility is 0.84 @xmath7 0.06 at an average projected baseline of 82.7 m at a p.a .",
    "= 37e of n. the calibrated visibilities and the system visibility estimates are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "if all the light in the fringe tracker field of view ( approximately the diffraction limit of the single telescope ) came from an unresolved point source , the interferometer calibrated @xmath18 would be unity .",
    "our measured @xmath18 is relatively high , implying the source of this emission is small .",
    "a variety of compact flux distributions could produce the measured visibility ; we have used three simple , geometric models to estimate the angular size of the emission .",
    "the models correspond to a `` face - on '' inclination and are constrained to fit the measured @xmath19 . if the emission is distributed as a single - component gaussian , the fwhm = 0.98 mas @xmath7 0.18 mas . if the the emission is distributed as a ring , the ring inner diameter = 0.96 mas @xmath7 0.26 with a width = 0.06 mas , where the width is set to match the total @xmath2 band flux for an optically thick medium with a temperature of 1500 k. if the emission is distributed as a point source with an extended ( over - resolved ) component , the point - source fraction of the flux = 0.92 @xmath7 0.04 of the flux .",
    "whatever the details of the emission distribution or mechanism , the bulk of the emission comes from a compact ( @xmath201.52 mas at the @xmath21 level ) region .",
    "our measurements rule out any scenario with a majority of the @xmath2 band nuclear emission coming from a region with a radius in projection larger than @xmath22 pc .",
    "we consider four possible mechanisms for the @xmath2 band emission . because of the combined constraints implied by our measurement and other observations , we find two of the cases to be unlikely",
    ".    * synchrotron emission : * vlba imaging of ngc 4151 at a few mas scales @xcite reveals that its parsec - scale radio jet is subluminous ; it is several orders of magnitude fainter than the parsec - scale radio jets imaged in nearby classical radio galaxies .",
    "measurements at 18 cm and 6 cm of the nuclear region reveal a relatively flat spectrum ( @xmath23 with @xmath24 ) source with a peak flux density of about 1 mjy mas@xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , the large near - infrared flux density of @xmath26 mjy mas@xmath25 is inconsistent with the radio fluxes and implies that the nuclear near - infrared source is unrelated to the radio source and , by inference , unrelated to a subparsec - scale synchrotron jet .",
    "* star cluster : * explaining the compact @xmath2 band emission as stellar would require @xmath27 o stars in a volume of @xmath28 pc@xmath29 . this explanation is unlikely , as it would imply a density for young stars @xmath30 times higher than in our own galactic center @xcite . a stellar component is also incompatible with the measured infrared intensity fluctuations @xcite .    * thermal dust : * if the dust is distributed as a physically thick torus , the inner radius is much smaller than typically estimated .",
    "the smallest possible scale for thermal dust emission is set by the dust sublimation radius . using the model of @xcite , we find dust with a temperature of 1900 k , corresponding to a sublimation radius of 0.05 pc , is consistent with our measurement .",
    "thus , if the infrared emission is from centrally heated dust , it is consistent with our observations only if the dust is very hot and the @xmath2 band emission is localized near the dust sublimation radius .    * thermal gas : * a simple , face - on , geometrically thin accretion disk model , with @xmath31 @xcite and with an inner temperature of @xmath32 k ( consistent with the soft x - ray emission @xcite ) , predicts a @xmath2 band magnitude of 8.4 , 95% of which is inside a radius of @xmath33 pc .",
    "this model predicts an unresolved point source , consistent with our size measurement and with approximately the measured near - infrared flux .",
    "both the thermal dust and thermal gas models are consistent with our observations .",
    "however , centrally heated dust , which is thought to reprocess uv / optical radiation from the central engine , produces a specific signature known as the `` infrared bump '' @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a comparable feature in ngc 4151 @xcite .",
    "also , a dust torus with a well - defined , but small , inner radius ( corresponding to the sublimation radius ) would give similar time delays between fluctuations in the uv / optical flux and fluctuations in the @xmath3 and @xmath2 band flux .",
    "this is inconsistent with the analysis by @xcite .",
    "thus the absence of the `` infrared bump '' and the presence of the @xmath3/@xmath2 time delay difference both support the interpretation that the bulk of the infrared flux measured with the interferometer arises from an unresolved accretion disk .",
    "we have measured the angular diameter of the @xmath2 band emission in the nucleus of ngc 4151 . our observations rule out any emission mechanism that requires a large fraction of the nuclear @xmath2 band emission to be produced at a radius of greater than 0.05 pc from the black hole .",
    "taken in the context of other observations , we interpret our measurement as evidence that a majority of the @xmath2 band emission comes from a central accretion disk .",
    "we dedicate these observations to the memory of jim kelley , the late project manager and tireless advocate of the keck interferometer .",
    "we thank robert antonucci , roger blandford , and julian krolik for useful discussions .",
    "the keck interferometer is funded by the national aeronautics and space administration as part of its navigator program .",
