    "a significant body of research in physics education has been devoted to improving the teaching and evaluation@xcite of electricity and magnetism ( e&m ) at the introductory level@xcite but less attention has been geared towards upper division e&m@xcite . learning",
    "physics at the upper division level is a complex procedure , and each student is unique in the way they process information to understand upper level physical concepts .",
    "resource theory@xcite seeks to describe the ways students link pieces of information to form more complex ideas , improve understanding , and solve problems .",
    "as researchers gain more insight into the diversity of student thought processes , patterns in how students use and combine resources help us better understand student learning .",
    "prior research into student learning of e&m at the upper division has focused on student understanding of specific topics like maxwell s equations@xcite . other research uses e&m as a context in which to study mathematical tools which support physical reasoning@xcite , student identity development@xcite , or epistemological framing@xcite . of the studies that focus on student understanding of specific physics topics , none focus on how students understand the behavior of linear materials in electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this topic is important because understanding fields in materials is integral to modern materials science , electrical engineering , and molecular physics .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss student responses to conceptual questions about linear materials in electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we categorize the responses by the students resource use , and look for changes across contexts and over time .",
    "previous research on resource theory and mental models in electricity and magnetism guides the research described in this paper .",
    "a resource , broadly speaking , is a discrete piece of an idea that a student activates when considering or solving a problem .",
    "it is important to note that resources themselves are not inherently right or wrong ( e.g. _ closer means stronger_)@xcite .",
    "student difficulties arise from misapplying resources ( e.g. it s hotter in the summer because the earth is closer to the sun ) .",
    "students build resources throughout their lives and education@xcite , and students use these resources by activating them and linking them to form mental models of complex physical and mathematical phenomena .",
    "several kinds of resources have been identified .",
    "conceptual resources are pieces of knowledge , such as _ coulomb s law _ or _ closer means stronger_. procedural resources@xcite are actions such as pulling constants out of a derivative@xcite or summing forces .",
    "epistemological resources@xcite are elements of beliefs about the nature of knowledge , such as whether results can be figured out or if they need to be looked up . to solve problems , students coordinate all three kinds of resources , activating connections between conceptual resources and procedural ones to build arguments , as mediated by epistemological resources about the problem solving they are engaged in .",
    "we are specifically interested in conceptual resources , and how instructors can recognize the resources students bring to the course and how they can encourage the use of those resources as applied to electricity and magnetism@xcite .",
    "we explore in this paper which conceptual resources activate in clusters when students explain polarization and magnetization .",
    "another characteristic of resources is their plasticity versus their solidity@xcite .",
    "resources can have `` internal structure '' meaning they can have concepts and explanation within them that may be accessed by the user .",
    "solid resources are durable and well established , and the internal structure need not be accessed for its use . in other words , they require less justification and can be more easily and readily used and linked with other resources .",
    "plastic resources are unstable and require more elaboration and justification to be used .",
    "they are usually new resources for the student , and their connections to other resources have yet to be solidified .",
    "more broadly , `` stable networks '' are networks of resources that are `` cognitively nearby , '' and tend to activate together@xcite . in this paper , we examine how the plasticity of conceptual resources and the networks and clusters of resources students use change with increased conceptual instruction .",
    "solid networks of resources form students mental models .",
    "mental models `` enable individuals to make predictions and inferences , to understand phenomena and events , to make decisions , and to control their execution .",
    "they are incomplete , despite being structural analogues of the processes taking place in the world''@xcite . after interviewing students across a wide range of ages and backgrounds , borges and",
    "gilbert gained insight into mental models of electricity , and found that the more successful and complete the model was , the more microscopic it tended to be .",
    "they also discuss students use of causal agents in their reasoning .",
    "they discovered that many of the more incomplete mental models the subjects had about electric current moving through a wire were characterized by the interchangeability of words such as `` electricity '' , `` current '' , and `` energy '' .",
    "the subjects knew that a causal agent must come between perceived related events , such as a wire being connected and a light bulb lighting up , and they filled in resources about `` something '' flowing .",
    "borges and gilbert investigated mental models of magnetism as well .",
    "although their discoveries were of mental models of magnets creating magnetic fields , those models may be closely related to the mental models students have of materials subjected to a magnetic field .",
    "again , the most complete mental models ( meaning the ones with the most power in making predictions and inferences about a situation ) were also the most microscopic models .",
    "they found that the participants interviewed with the most prior experience and instruction about magnetism were the only ones who thought of magnetism as a result of micro - currents circling around the atoms in a material that line up to produce a field .",
    "deliberate instruction can affect students mental models noting that `` when comparing students models , the effects of their models are evident , as shown by the vocabulary and the type of constructs they use.''@xcite finally , they emphasize the benefit of teachers knowing the mental models their students bring to the course , which is also one of the main goals of resource theory.@xcite",
    "the data analyzed for this paper comes from students written test responses spanning two years at kansas state university .",
    "the upper - division e&m course is available every fall semester , and typically covers the first half of griffiths s text @xcite , maxwell s equations in matter and vacuum .",
    "the class meets four days a week for fifty minutes each .",
    "about one third of the days are tutorial days in which students complete guided practice problems in small groups instead of listening to a lecture .",
    "thirty - eight students in total completed the class in 2014 and 2015 , and 55 assessments were collected , both during instruction and at the final exam .",
    "we analyzed all usable answers to find patterns and trends in the students use of resources , and we also searched for patterns among the 2015 students responses during and after they completed the class .",
    "the data come from two cohorts of students who took the class in 2014 and 2015 . in 2014 , on the final exam ( `` final 2014 '' ) , 19 students were asked all three questions from figure  [ fig1 ] . in 2015 , 18 students were asked only part ( b ) of this problem ( electric fields ) near the beginning of instruction on this topic in the 12th week of the semester ( `` mid - semester 2015 '' ) , and all parts of the problem on their final exam ( `` final 2015 '' ) . between",
    "the 2015 pretest and final , students were given targeted instruction on this problem .",
    "the following is a complete and correct response to the exam question students were asked .",
    "when a dielectric material is placed in an electric field , its atoms become polarized .",
    "this means that the negative electron cloud around the positive nucleus is slightly displaced from the center .",
    "this displacement of charges within the atoms form electric dipoles with separation linearly proportional to the strength of the electric field , as given by the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is net polarization , @xmath2 is the electric field , and the rest are constants . when the electric field s strength exceeds a certain threshold value , electrons become separated from their nuclei , converting the dielectric into a conductor",
    "this is called dielectric breakdown .    when a linear paramagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field ,",
    "whatever magnetic dipoles that already exist become more aligned with the field , tending to point in the same direction as each other .",
    "as opposed to polarization , magnetization of a material does not separate any charges , but merely changes the random direction of spins within the atoms to be more uniform .",
    "the magnetization @xmath3 of a material is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic field and @xmath6 is a constant dependent on the material .",
    "the linear relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath5 breaks down after @xmath5 is strong enough to align all of the magnetic moments of the atoms parallel to it .",
    "after that threshold , @xmath5 can increase but @xmath3 can not .",
    "no breakdown of the material occurs .",
    "we reviewed all 55 student exams , seeking patterns in student understanding .",
    "three students did not answer the question and two students wrote about the unrelated phenomenon of polarization of light .",
    "we discarded these students exams from further analysis .",
    "in addition , one student did not take final 2015 and one student was absent for mid - semester 2015 , leaving 50 usable responses in all , 33 for 2015 and 17 for 2014 .    to find patterns , we considered each response s resources , drawing resource graphs@xcite to generalize them across responses .",
    "as themes emerged in the data , we sought a categorization scheme which would both capture the rich variety of student responses and make meaningful categorical differences among them .",
    "we iteratively developed an emergent coding scheme linking specific student language to specific resource use .",
    "when our coding scheme was stable , we invited an additional researcher to separately code student responses .",
    "we classified each response as _ microscopic _ or _ non - microscopic _ ( which are explained in the next section ) .",
    "then we noted which resources each student used by the criteria in our codebook . if the student s resources did not fall into any of the categories we defined , we marked them as `` other . ''",
    "we chose 20 written answers at random for evaluation during inter - rater reliability testing ( irr ) .",
    "the result for the irr before the training was 82% similar .",
    "training included clarifying and improving parts of the codebook and discussing each response categorized differently .",
    "after the training , the irr on a different set of responses increased to 100% .",
    "as part of our investigation , we looked at how students considered what happens to a dielectric material in an extremely strong electric field .",
    "we examined their responses for evidence of resources being activated . when observing the students answers to the polarization question",
    ", we found that the resources students activated generally fell into two groups .",
    "the first group , which we call _ microscopic _ , consists of students who used resources related to the internal structure of the atoms within the material .",
    "this includes mention of electron clouds along with nuclei , stretching of the negative and positive charges within the atom , drawings of dipoles with positive and negative sides , and internal forces of the atom versus the external force of the electric field .",
    "23 of 50 responses are in this category .",
    "the second group , _ non - microscopic _ , consists of students who , instead of thinking about the internal structure of the atom , talked only about the material in general .",
    "these students often considered the problem in terms of the model of positive and negative charges moving throughout the material and collecting on one side , as opposed to thinking about the atoms themselves becoming dipoles aligned with , and pulled apart by , the field .",
    "included in this category are drawings of material with pluses and minuses lined up within it ( that do not form polarized atoms ) , mention of electrons or charges without reference to an atom , and mention of the word `` dipole '' without description or depiction of its structure .",
    "27 of 50 responses are in this category .    when comparing the answers of the _ microscopic _ and _ non - microscopic _ groups represented in table  [ table1 ] , we found that if a student considers the internal structure of the atom during polarization , they are very likely to arrive at the correct answer , dielectric _ breakdown_. this is true for all three testing situations we evaluated .",
    "furthermore , on the two tests where students had not been given the question before ( mid - semester 2015 and final 2014 ) , the students that took the _ non - microscopic _ route were not likely to get to _ breakdown _ over other answers .",
    "this is especially true for mid - semester 2015 , when the students had not yet been taught the material .",
    ".resource groups activated by students versus their answers while writing about material in fields . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    there were other variations of resources used within the large groups of _ microscopic _ and _ non - microscopic _ resources . students who used _ microscopic _ resources and reached _ breakdown _ tended to justify their answers one of two ways .",
    "in the first approach , students described how maximum polarization pulls the electron cloud so far away from the nucleus that electrons break from their nuclei .",
    "we called this resource _ maximum displacement _ , and cluster a is the name we gave the cluster of resources including _ microscopic _ resources , _ maximum displacement _ , and _ breakdown_. in the second method , students described the internal atomic forces holding the electrons and nuclei together , and how an electric field above a certain threshold would provide a large enough force to overcome the internal force and break electrons away from their atoms .",
    "we called this resource _ balancing forces _ and its cluster we call cluster b. they are essentially the same phenomenon , but _ balancing forces _ is a more rigorous description .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] depicts the common clusters of resources used by students .",
    "an example of a student response that includes _ microscopic _ resources and the _ balancing forces _ resource ( cluster a ) is that of `` kate '' in mid - semester 2015 .",
    "`` polarizing atoms means slightly offsetting the negative electron cloud from the positive nucleus . ''",
    "it is clear that kate uses _",
    "microscopic _ resources to frame the question .",
    "she goes on to say , `` if the field doing this is strong enough , it will separate the two entirely , since it will overcome the coulombic force attracting the electrons to the nucleus .",
    "the electrons will gather on one side of the material . ''",
    "the use of the words `` overcome '' and `` force attracting the electrons to the nucleus '' shows that _ balancing forces _ activated along with _ breakdown_.    in her answer for final 2015 , kate used cluster b instead .",
    "she wrote , `` the external electric field pulls on the electron clouds in the individual atoms / molecules , creating a polarization . ''",
    "she mentioned electron clouds in relation to their atoms , so we classified her as using _",
    "microscopic _ resources , seeing as she conceptualized the situation on a subatomic level .",
    "kate continued , writing `` as the field increases , the electron clouds get pulled farther and farther away from the nucleus , until they can go no farther without leaving the nucleus entirely . ''",
    "we classified this resource as _ maximum displacement _ because she mentioned the distance between the electron clouds and the nuclei reaching a breaking point .",
    "for part two of the question , she wrote , `` the electrons are ripped away from the nuclei , causing a brief flow of charge ( dielectric breakdown ) '' .",
    "students who did not think about polarization at the subatomic level tended to justify their answers using a description of the dipoles or charges aligning with the field until none of the dipoles or charges could be more aligned .",
    "this resource , _ alignment _ , was usually paired with the final answer of _",
    "saturation_. these students wrote that nothing significant happened to the material besides _",
    "alignment _ , failing to mention _",
    "breakdown_. we called this cluster of resources cluster c. several students responses ( twelve responses in all ) that used this cluster made no mention of separation of charges during polarization and only mentioned _ alignment _ of the dipoles , treating polarization and magnetization as the same phenomenon in their answers .",
    "many students used a model of charges aligning in some way across the material while separating as well .",
    "an example of cluster c is alex s answer in final 2014 .",
    "he wrote , `` polarization occurs when an e - field pushes all @xmath7 charges one way and the @xmath8 charges move the opposite direction .",
    "this causes an e - field from the difference between separated @xmath7 and @xmath8 charges . ''",
    "there is no mention of atoms here , and the term `` charges , '' especially when he discusses positive charges , indicates his use of the model of charges moving throughout an insulator and causing net effects rather than electrons moving within an atom .",
    "he went on to write , `` eventually all the @xmath7 will be as far to one side as possible and all of @xmath8 will be as far as possible in the opposite direction .",
    "the charges are as far away as possible with all the charges segregated . at this point",
    ", no more charges can move so e will increase , but p ca nt . '' here , he activates the resources _ alignment _ and _ saturation_. in summary , he uses _ non - microscopic _ resources , _ alignment _ , and _",
    "saturation_.    the rest of the students answers indicated the activation of other resource clusters which we grouped into the miscellaneous cluster d. this includes any answers that were neither _ breakdown _ nor _",
    "saturation_. it also includes students who used _ microscopic _ resources but reached an answer of _ saturation _ , or students who used _ non - microscopic _ resources but reached an answer of _ breakdown_. and",
    "finally , it includes the few students who used none of these or misunderstood what the question asked of them .",
    "the grouping of these resources into clusters aided us in finding patterns in student responses over varied context and amount of instruction . as stated before , for all three testing situations , using",
    "_ microscopic _",
    "resources almost always coincided with activating the resource of _",
    "breakdown_. conversely , activation of _ non - microscopic _ resources coincided with activation of the _ saturation _ resource instead of _",
    "interestingly though , on final 2015 , there was not as much of a difference between the number of _ microscopic _ and _ non - microscopic _ students who arrived at _ breakdown_. in fact , 13 out of 18 students reached _ breakdown _ on final 2015 , whereas only 8 out of 18 reached",
    "_ breakdown _ on mid - semester 2015 .",
    "below are details about why this may have occurred .",
    "table  [ table2 ] summarizes the number of students who used each cluster on mid - semester 2015 and final 2015 .",
    "four students switched from using cluster a , b , or c in the pretest to using cluster d ( and still getting _ breakdown _ ) on the final . take zachary s response for final 2015 for which he wrote , `` the material is bounded . above and below the faces of the material are regions of different @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these regions do not have the same property as the linear material , and so the max p occurs at e threshold , when all the charges are on opposing faces . ''",
    "along with his written answer , zachary also drew a diagram of a rectangular prism in an electric field .",
    "he went on to say , `` to remain in equilibrium , the dipole @xmath11 .",
    "this is achieved by highly polarizing the material , so all the positive charges are on top face , and @xmath8 charges on bottom face .",
    "this occurs at e threshold .",
    "if @xmath12 , the charges ca nt balance out , and the charges begin to strip away from the material and end the linear property . ''",
    "zachary was able to reach _ breakdown _ without activating _ microscopic _ resources , unlike in his answer for the question during the pretest for which he used cluster a. he discusses only _ non - microscopic _ qualities and phenomena in his response after instruction about materials in electric fields and the internal process of polarization .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the instructor facilitated activation of those _ microscopic _ resources in a way that allowed them to go from being plastic to solid in zachary s mind .",
    "the instructor reviewed the exact question after the pretest , and used _ microscopic _ descriptions in a mid - semester lecture including the fact that each atom is made up of a little bit of negative and positive , and the positive center is surrounded by the negative outside .",
    "she also describes _ breakdown _ as when `` electrons get ripped away from atoms , '' and contrasts separation and alignment .",
    "this lecturing could have increased zachary s ability to use _ breakdown _ as a resource on the final exam without accessing its internal structure or having to justify it further by using _ microscopic _ resources .",
    "l c c + & mid - semester test & final test + cluster a & 4 & 7 + cluster b & 3 & 2 + cluster c & 7 & 2 + cluster d & 2 & 6 +    [ table2 ]    four other students used cluster c or d , getting _ saturation _",
    ", on the pretest , and then switched to cluster a or b on the final , indicating that they understood the lecture and used the resources given to them by instruction to correctly answer the final .",
    "the remaining students either used the same cluster for both exams , or used a different cluster resulting in the same answer for both .",
    "the second part of our research was to analyze data from the portion of the question on the two final exams about materials in extremely high magnetic fields .",
    "this part of the question was not included in mid - semester 2015 .",
    "unlike the polarization question , none of the students who answered the magnetization question had seen the problem before their final exam . however , they had all been taught concepts about magnetic fields and magnetization through practice problems and lectures prior to the final .",
    "the purpose of this question was to get students to compare and contrast what happens to dielectric materials when they are highly polarized versus highly magnetized .",
    "the vast majority of student responses included only _ non - microscopic _ resources to describe and explain magnetization and its effect on the material .",
    "these resources consisted mainly of alignment of atoms in some sense .",
    "only two students did not reach the correct answer of _ saturation _ , and interestingly , those students used _",
    "microscopic _ resources in their responses .",
    "those students mentioned the internal structure of the atom during magnetization , and they concluded with _",
    "breakdown _ of the material .",
    "we recorded the class meetings in 2015 about magnetization as part of a broader project on student reasoning during class . upon reviewing the lectures",
    ", we discovered how different the magnetization lectures were from the polarization lectures discussed in the last section .",
    "the instructor used almost no conceptual or _ microscopic _ description of magnetization , and instead focused on bolstering the students mathematical understanding of the way material behaves in high magnetic fields .",
    "she mentioned ways different materials hold magnetization and for how long ( such as the ferromagnet s ability to become a permanent magnet ) , and several students included that information in their responses .",
    "however , the only conceptual explanation on a _ microscopic _ level was that atoms can align with or against the field based on the thing that is doing the spinning to make the current in the dipole. she says that this `` thing '' is `` all kinds of quantum - y things '' and has to do with how electrons are paired in atoms .",
    "this is a contrast from the lecture on polarization which focused on a _ microscopic _ description of _ breakdown_. the student responses reflect this difference .",
    "although only two students said that something happens to the material besides a maximum alignment ( and therefore _ saturation _ ) , the `` things '' that students said were aligning varied widely .",
    "over twenty different words were used for this `` thing , '' and most of the pictures drawn were arrows lining up with each other , indicating a very _ non - microscopic _ model of magnetization .",
    "the words used included correct terminology such as `` magnetic moment '' , `` dipole '' , and `` electron spin '' , and incorrect or incomplete terminology such as `` electrons '' , `` atoms '' , and `` little pieces . '' all answers including _ alignment _ and _ saturation _ were given credit .",
    "this lack of a complete group of resources to make up a mental model of magnetization could be due to the instruction the students were given .",
    "the students lacked a link between the idea that material is made of atoms and that something about those atoms aligns during magnetization .",
    "the wording of the question indicated that the correct answer is _ saturation _ , so students may have activated conceptual resources to link the resources activated by the question .",
    "these results differ from the polarization results because the polarization question asked students to take their mental models of materials in electric fields and extrapolate them to explain a special case . in those responses ,",
    "the answers were more varied in the students conclusions instead of their explanations .",
    "in other words , although the wording of the question was identical for both magnetization and polarization , it favored _ saturation _ as opposed to _ breakdown _ judging from the amount of students answers ending in _",
    "saturation_. a similar result was found in borges and gilbert s research in which they describe student use of a causal agent to fill in logical gaps left by the question .",
    "borges and gilbert s research also supports this claim that student responses and explanations should not be analyzed separately from the question they were asked.@xcite",
    "we discussed the clusters of resources activated together when upper division e&m students expounded on the behavior of materials in fields .",
    "we showed how those clusters changed with time and context , specifically with increased instruction of the concepts in question .",
    "we have offered insight to which mental models are most helpful for fostering complete conceptual understanding of polarization and magnetization .",
    "the data indicate that use of resources related to the internal structure of the atom during polarization increased likelihood of activating _",
    "breakdown_. students who did not activate these _ microscopic _ resources tended to activate _ saturation _ instead .",
    "this predictive relationship was not as strong on final 2015 , where we argue that because the students had seen the question and received instruction , the resource clusters they used changed from mid - semester 2015 .",
    "the _ breakdown _ resource became more solid and required less justification for use , making the students answers less _ microscopic _ but not less correct .",
    "we also assert that wording of a question has a role in activating certain resources in the student and can cause mechanistic reasoning@xcite .",
    "students knew that some aspect of a material becomes saturated when it is in an extreme magnetic field , and they filled in objects to link their knowledge that material is made up of `` things '' , and that these things align in the presence of the field .",
    "this research yields multiple implications for instruction of e&m . after comparing the answers in part a and b of the final question and watching videos of the lectures corresponding to them ,",
    "we hope to encourage instructors to put more emphasis on _ microscopic _ conceptual models when teaching polarization .",
    "we found evidence to support that thinking of polarization inside the atom seems to increase understanding and can give students better intuition about special cases such as dielectric _ breakdown _ without hurting their understanding of magnetization .",
    "these implications for instruction can also apply to lower and higher level courses than upper division e&m , and conceptual understanding of physical phenomena on a _ microscopic _ scale could be a helpful supplement to math based curricula as well .    in conclusion ,",
    "the goals of this study were to identify the clusters of resources that successful students activated while answering an upper - level conceptual problem in e&m , and to highlight the role of the instructor to facilitate activation of those resources .",
    "we know that active learning environments paired with conceptual curricula improve student understanding of physics , but improved instructional methods are still needed to support students reasoning in these areas , especially for upper division courses . finally , our work highlights the need for future research on students use of resources to solve problems in these upper division physics courses .",
