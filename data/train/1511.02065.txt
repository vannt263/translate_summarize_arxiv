    "the study of photon  photon ( @xmath3 ) fusion processes in proton  proton ( @xmath4 ) collisions at the lhc provides a very important test of the electroweak theory  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 interactions leading to four leptons ( @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) can be another step towards these studies .    the baseline cross section , @xmath9 , has been first estimated in the low - energy approximation  @xcite .",
    "since then , the theoretical computations of these processes have been extended to high energy domain , at center - of - mass energies of the @xmath10 system around the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "this becomes particularly interesting when these calculations are considered at the lhc for @xmath4 collisions .",
    "two - photon production of four leptons can be formed via purely exclusive process : the leptons are produced through the @xmath3 interaction , where the photons are emitted coherently by each of the colliding protons . in general , it is also possible that one or both protons dissociate into some hadronic state .",
    "then , the reaction is not exclusive but inelastic ( as protons dissociate ) , while being induced by photons emitted from quarks in the proton .",
    "this is why the label photon - induced production of four leptons is used in the following .",
    "the main purpose of these studies , besides the cross section estimation , is to provide the relative contribution of two - photon production of four leptons compared to other processes at the lhc , e.g. to the @xmath11 production  @xcite or higgs boson decaying to four leptons  @xcite .",
    "this type of photon - induced processes may appear as a background to the exclusive @xmath12 production  @xcite , which is also discussed .",
    "the elementary process cross section calculation is based essentially on summation of the leading - order amplitudes , represented by their feynman diagrams in figure  [ figdiag1 ] . from these diagrams",
    ", it can be shown that the bulk of the contribution comes from the production ( a ) : the two photons radiate a pair of leptons and two of these leptons undergo scattering ( the @xmath13-channel photon exchange ) with its characteristic singularity in the forward direction ( when @xmath13 tends towards zero ) .",
    "in general , this diagram is divergent in the limit of massless leptons , which means the leptons are emitted almost collinear to the beams .",
    "it is also worth noticing that these calculations do not include @xmath14 process  @xcite , which is forbidden at the tree - level , hence this contribution is highly suppressed and can be neglected in these studies .    .",
    "all contributing diagrams form terms of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electromagnetic coupling constant.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -275,0)(a ) ( -175,0)(b ) ( -79,0)(c )    the calculations of the elementary cross section @xmath17 are performed using full tree - level monte carlo ( mc ) program madgraph5@xmath18amc@xmath19nlo  @xcite , referred to hereafter as madgraph . indeed , it is important to recall that the cross sections for the two - photon production of four leptons using madgraph have already been shown to be in a good agreement with independent calculations  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the typical values of electroweak cross sections that occur in @xmath3 collisions up to energies accessible at the lhc .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ figelem_xs_comp1 ] .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath20 are presented as a function of the energy of the two - photon system ( @xmath21 ) for different final states : four leptons , two leptons and two @xmath22 bosons of opposite charges decaying to leptons and neutrinos .",
    "prior to any angular cuts , figure  [ figelem_xs_comp1 ] shows that the cross section for the process @xmath23 is behaving as @xmath24 , while the cross section for @xmath25 is constant with @xmath21 .",
    "the same constant behavior is obtained for the production of two @xmath22 bosons once the production threshold is reached . in each case",
    "this constant behavior as a function of @xmath21 is due to the spin-1 @xmath13-channel particle exchange ( photon or @xmath22 boson respectively ) , which implies that the cross section is completely dominated by configurations where the leptons are emitted in very forward directions , almost collinear to the beams .",
    "then , no dependence on the energy of the two - photon system is expected .     as a function of the energy of the two - photon system , @xmath21 .",
    "different electroweak final states are pictured with and without requirements on the pseudorapidities of leptons ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the cross section for lepton - neutrino pair production involves decays of @xmath22 bosons . ]",
    "however , we are interested in the possibility of measuring such processes in collider experiments . therefore , a more realistic view is obtained for the typical values of cross sections for @xmath20 , once some angular cuts are applied on the leptons , in order to mimic their acceptances inside the trackers of e.g. atlas or cms experiments at the lhc  @xcite ( see figure  [ figelem_xs_comp1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the cross sections for @xmath27 and @xmath28 reactions behave as @xmath24 . again , this is due to the @xmath13(@xmath29)-channel poles in the forward ( backward ) directions : with increasing energy , these cross sections increase in the very forward and backward direction being proportional to @xmath30 but they decrease in the central region , being proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "in order to compute the cross section for the photon - induced production of four leptons in @xmath4 collisions at the lhc , at @xmath4 center - of - mass energy @xmath31 , we follow a similar methodology as presented in refs .",
    "@xcite for the photon - induced @xmath32 production . at first",
    "what is needed is the calculation of the elementary cross section of the @xmath3 interactions leading to four leptons , @xmath17 , performed in section  [ sec2 ] .    for the exclusive reaction ,",
    "each of the two incoming protons emits a quasi - real photon which then fuse to give a centrally produced four - lepton final state ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the calculations rely on the so - called equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite . for the modelling of the exclusive reaction in @xmath4 collisions ,",
    "the epa is used with the standard dipole parameterization of proton electromagnetic form - factors @xcite .",
    "no specific corrections are applied to take into account proton absorptive effects  @xcite .    when one or both protons dissociate into a hadronic state , dedicated parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for photons",
    "are used  @xcite . in view of making realistic estimates for what can be observed at the lhc , another interest of using madgraph",
    "is that it allows to take into account qcd effects , such as the underlying event and parton shower in single and double - dissociative events .",
    "for this purpose , madgraph is interfaced with pythia  8  @xcite .",
    "differential cross sections for @xmath5 production in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath33 tev as a function of the transverse momenta for all outgoing leptons are presented in figure  [ figpt ] , where the nnpdf2.3qed pdfs are used for the proton - dissociative case . in this figure ,",
    "some kinematic requirements are imposed to mimic realistic measurements in the atlas and cms experiments . as in figure",
    "[ figelem_xs_comp1 ] , the absolute values of the pseudorapidities for all leptons are required to be @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the transverse momenta for the leading and sub - leading leptons are taken to be above @xmath34 gev . this requirement is imposed to ensure high triggering efficiency in the atlas and cms experiments during nominal lhc runs  @xcite .",
    "the two other leptons are requested to have transverse momenta above @xmath35 gev .",
    "this threshold should be taken as low as possible , in the limit where it is still possible to use trackers in order to discriminate between e.g. electrons and pions  @xcite .",
    "finally , the angular separation between each pair of leptons , @xmath36 , is taken to be @xmath37 to allow the experimental separation of these objects .",
    "production in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath33 tev as a function of ( a ) leading lepton @xmath38 , ( b ) sub - leading lepton @xmath38 , ( c ) third lepton @xmath38 and ( d ) fourth lepton @xmath38 .",
    "the stacked histograms , in top - to - bottom order , represent the exclusive , single - dissociative and double - dissociative contributions .",
    "some fiducial cuts are applied ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -215,102)(a ) ( -70,102)(b ) ( -215,0)(c ) ( -70,0)(d )    there are two important points to observe in figure  [ figpt ] : ( 1 ) the single and double - dissociative reactions have similar cross sections in the kinematic phase space defined above and ( 2 ) this cross section ( summed ) is about ten times larger than for the exclusive case .",
    "the exclusive and proton - dissociative contributions can be easily separated using lepton kinematic distributions , like total @xmath38 of the @xmath1 system  @xcite , since the lepton directions and momenta can be precisely measured .",
    "comparison of total cross sections for @xmath5 production in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath33 tev and 13 tev with typical lepton kinematic cuts is shown in table  [ table1 ] . here",
    "also the two different photon pdfs are compared for modelling proton - dissociative contributions .",
    "the double - dissociative part is about 3 times larger when using mrst2004qed pdf set .",
    "this is due to the growth of the mrst2004qed photon pdfs over the nnpdf2.3qed set at smaller @xmath39 values of photons ( @xmath40 )  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections compared in table  [ table1 ] are of the order of @xmath41fb , therefore possible to be measured at the lhc under nominal running conditions .",
    "the identification of @xmath0 events of interest can be performed using veto on additional charged - particle tracks , successfully used by the atlas and cms experiments to significantly reduce the inclusive background  @xcite .",
    "moreover , all quoted cross sections can be increased by a factor of 2.3 when the requirement on leading and subleading lepton @xmath38 is lowered from 10 gev to 5 gev .    .",
    "total cross sections for @xmath0  ( @xmath42 ) production in @xmath4 collisions for @xmath43 tev and 13 tev .",
    "leptons with @xmath26 and @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 gev , @xmath47 gev are considered .",
    "different contributions are presented : exclusive , single - dissociative and double - dissociative .",
    "for modelling of single and double - dissociative contributions , two different photon pdfs are compared .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "the inclusive production of four leptons has been recently measured by the atlas experiment  @xcite .",
    "let us recall that in the standard model , the @xmath1 production in the invariant mass range domain around the @xmath48 boson resonance occurs dominantly via the @xmath49-channel process , where the @xmath48 boson decaying to leptons includes the production of an additional lepton pair from the internal conversion of a virtual @xmath48 boson or a virtual photon .",
    "also , the cross section is significantly increased when both @xmath48 bosons are produced on - shell , resulting in the rise in the @xmath50 spectrum observed around @xmath51 gev .",
    "in addition to the @xmath52-initiated process of @xmath1 production , there are some gluon  gluon initiated processes , @xmath53 , needed to be considered  @xcite .",
    "the gluon - induced processes significantly contribute to the on - shell higgs boson production that obviously gives a sharp resonance around @xmath54 gev  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of photon - induced @xmath1 contribution to the abovementioned processes is presented in figure  [ figinvmassglobal ] , alternatively for mrst2004qed and nnpdf2.3qed pdfs , where the latter includes additional pdfs uncertainty estimation . for this figure ,",
    "the same fiducial cuts as in  @xcite are applied .",
    "similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath55 and on - shell higgs - boson production contributions are modeled at next - to - leading - order ( in perturbative qcd ) using powheg - box  @xcite mc generator .",
    "the non - resonant @xmath56 process is simulated at leading - order with mcfm  @xcite program .",
    "both generators are interfaced with ct10  @xcite pdf set .",
    "figure  [ figinvmassglobal ] shows that , depending on the photon pdfs used , the photon - induced part can reach up to 5% of the standard @xmath57 contribution in the non - resonant mass range of the @xmath48 boson ( i.e. @xmath58 gev @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 gev @xmath61 gev ) and up to 3% in the mass range of the higgs boson .",

    "the enhancement of the elementary @xmath0 cross section at large lepton pseudorapidities gives the possibility that some of the four leptons will escape detection , whereas other could mimic the exclusive 2@xmath64 final state .",
    "in particular , this is interesting when comparing to processes with relatively small cross sections at the lhc , like the exclusive @xmath12 production , used to test the anomalous @xmath65 couplings  @xcite . here the @xmath66 final state is examined , which forms effectively an experimental state with two charged - leptons .    using the same fiducial region definition as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 ) applied to one of the @xmath69 pair in the @xmath63 final state and imposing additional pseudorapidity veto ( @xmath70 ) on the remaining @xmath71 pair , we obtain : @xmath72 to be compared with  @xcite : @xmath73 however , imposing final requirement on the @xmath69 pair transverse momentum , @xmath74 gev  @xcite , leads to : @xmath75    it is worth mentioning that the contribution of the process @xmath76 can be estimated using same - sign lepton pairs , i.e. @xmath77 whereas the remaining @xmath78 pair is emitted at large pseudorapidities .",
    "this would allow to reduce the contamination from other ( inclusive and exclusive ) processes , which mostly produce opposite - sign lepton pair final states .",
    "the production of @xmath0 events at the lhc provides an ideal testing ground for the study of qed at @xmath15 elementary process level .",
    "the obtained values of the cross sections show that it can be possible to measure the @xmath0 reactions in @xmath4 collisions at the lhc .",
    "indeed , it has been already demonstrated that the @xmath10 interactions can be studied at the lhc , under normal running conditions , i.e. in the presence of additional pile - up events that spoil the identification of the @xmath10 interactions of interest .    for @xmath1 production in @xmath4 collisions , the mechanism of two - photon fusion",
    "is compared with that of quark  antiquark and gluon  gluon .",
    "the predictions show that the total @xmath3 cross section should contribute up to 5% in some kinematical regions accessible by the lhc experiments . moreover",
    ", the @xmath63 final state with one of the @xmath69 pair emitted at large pseudorapidities can be a background to the @xmath79 reaction , reducing the sensitivity for anomalous @xmath65 coupling searches .",
