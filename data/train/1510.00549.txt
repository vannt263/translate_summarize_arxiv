    "@xmath12 is the minimum @xmath11 over all drawings @xmath2 of @xmath13 .",
    "a drawing is _ crossing optimal ( or minimal ) _ if it realizes @xmath14 .",
    "a long - standing conjecture is that the crossing number @xmath15 of the complete graph @xmath0 is equal to @xmath16 a very fine history of this and related problems is given by beineke and wilson  @xcite .",
    "they attribute the conjecture to anthony hill .",
    "as it is first published by harary and hill in  @xcite , we propose the notation @xmath5 used above to denote the conjectured value of @xmath15 and attribute the conjecture to harary - hill . according to  @xcite , hill proposed a construction with vertices on two concentric cycles and conjectured @xmath5 to be the number of crossings for those drawings .",
    "blaek and koman  @xcite proved the following variation of hill s construction .",
    "half of the vertices are drawn evenly spaced ( as a cycle ) at the rim of the top lid of a cylinder ( tin can ) and the remaining vertices are drawn evenly spaced at the rim of the bottom lid .",
    "the edges are drawn either as straight - lines within the cylinder lids or ( in the case they connect two vertices from different lids ) as shortest geodesic lines on the cylinder .",
    "this model is identical to the model with two concentric circles and it gave rise to a name for a whole class of drawings , see below .",
    "so far , the conjecture has been verified for @xmath17 only .",
    "pan and richter  @xcite have shown that @xmath18 is 100 using a computer proof ; well - known counting arguments show @xmath19 .",
    "mcquillan and richter  @xcite present a computer - free proof that @xmath20 .",
    "recently , an important line of research has been started by brego et al .",
    "@xcite , who restricted the allowed drawing styles and proved that for these drawings the conjecture is true . in @xcite",
    ", they consider 2-page book drawings of @xmath0 in which all vertices are supposed to lie on a line @xmath21 and each edge needs to be drawn on one of the two half - planes defined by @xmath21 . in  @xcite , the authors extended their techniques to _ monotone _ drawings of @xmath0 , in which all the vertices have different @xmath22-coordinates and the edges are @xmath22-monotone curves . in  @xcite , brego et al .",

    "cylindrical drawing _ has two concentric circles on which all the vertices must be placed and all edges must not intersect these circles . an _",
    "@xmath22-bounded drawing _ requires that all edges are contained within a strip bounded by the vertical lines defined by their endpoints .",
    "every monotone drawing is @xmath22-bounded and every 2-page book drawing is a cylindrical drawing , so their result indeed generalizes previous results .",
    "their result , which also prompted this work , was based on the first general combinatorial condition on a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0 that guarantees that @xmath2 has at least @xmath5 crossings . for this , they introduced the notion of _ shellability _ of a drawing of @xmath0 .    in a related work , balko et al .  @xcite give a combinatorial characterization of several classes of @xmath22-monotone drawings of complete graphs and show that also the odd crossing number ( a different variant of counting crossings ) of @xmath22-monotone drawings as well as shellable drawings of @xmath0 is at least @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to define a more general version of shellability that we call bishellability , and which is implied by shellability .",
    "the main benefit of our approach is the simplification of the principal concept .",
    "this allows a significantly simpler and more intuitive proof for the fact that bishellable drawings satisfy the harary - hill conjecture .",
    "moreover , bishellability reflects better the required properties .",
    "we are convinced that this is a further step to gain more insight into the structure of crossing minimal drawings , with the ultimate goal to prove the harary - hill conjecture .",
    "( for the following definition , we recall that , for a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0 , a _ face _ of  @xmath2 is a component of @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "this is the same notion as for embeddings : if we convert each crossing point of @xmath2 into a vertex , then the faces of @xmath2 are the faces of the planarly embedded graph . )",
    "finally , if @xmath24 is a subset of vertices in the drawing , @xmath25 denotes the drawing obtained when vertices of @xmath24 and all edges incident to them are deleted from @xmath2 .    for a positive integer @xmath3 , a planar drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0",
    "is if there is a sequence @xmath26 of distinct vertices of @xmath2 so that , relative to a reference face @xmath27 , for all integers @xmath28 with @xmath29 , the vertices  @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both incident with the face of @xmath32 containing @xmath27 .",

    ", then @xmath34 .",
    "one of the disadvantages of the notion of shellability is that @xmath3-shellable does not imply @xmath35-shellable .",
    "this is because the sequence @xmath26 of vertices needs to be circular to get from the reference face @xmath27 and back to @xmath27 again , and a long circular sequence does not imply a shorter circular sequence .",
    "we introduce a more general variant of shellability that we call _",
    "bishellability_.    for a non - negative integer @xmath3 , a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0 is _",

    "moreover , the vertices @xmath48 and @xmath49 must lie on the boundary of the common face @xmath27    also , if @xmath2 is @xmath3-shellable , with witnessing sequence @xmath26 , then @xmath2 is @xmath50-bishellable with witnessing sequences @xmath51 and @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    here is the version of theorem  [ th : old ] that holds for bishellable drawings ; its proof is in the next section .",

    "there are two main remarks to be made here .",
    "first is the pleasant feature that the theorem requires only one value for the amount of bishellability of the drawing .",
    "second , even though the same principal ideas are used in the two proofs , the proof of theorem  [ th : main ] involves a simpler induction than the proof of theorem  [ th : old ] in  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the monotonicity of the new definition of bishellability .    besides the proof of theorem [ th : main ]",
    ", we show that bishellability leads to an extended class of drawings for which the harary - hill conjecture is true .",
    "figure [ fig : n11bi ] shows an example of a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath8 that is @xmath57-bishellable ( so theorem [ th : main ] shows @xmath58 ) , but , for every @xmath59 , is not @xmath3-shellable ( so theorem [ th : old ] does not apply ) .    to simplify the discussion",
    ", we define a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0 to be _",
    "shellable _ if it is @xmath3-shellable for some @xmath60 , and _",
    "bishellable _ if it is @xmath61-bishellable .",
    "that is , shellable and bishellable drawings have at least @xmath5 crossings .",
    "furthermore , we call a drawing of @xmath0 _ harary - hill optimal  _ if it has @xmath5 crossings .",
    "we use this notation to keep in mind that drawings with @xmath5 crossings are only conjectured to be optimal .",
    "in this section , we recall the notion of good drawings and @xmath62-edges , and how to express the crossing number of a drawing @xmath2 in terms of a weighted sum of the numbers of @xmath62-edges , for @xmath63 .",
    "then we prove that , under the assumption that a drawing @xmath2 is bishellable , for each relevant @xmath62 , the relevant weighted sum of @xmath62-edges is large enough to prove that there are at least @xmath5 crossings in @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that we consider only _ good _ drawings ( also known as simple topological drawings ) : no edge can cross itself ; no two edges with a common incident vertex can cross ; and no two edges can cross more than once .",
    "it is well - known that any drawing of a graph @xmath13 with fewest crossings is necessarily good .",
    "the relation between the number of crossings in a rectilinear ( or pseudo - linear ) drawing of @xmath64 and the number of its @xmath65-edges was first described by lovsz et al .",
    "@xcite and , independently , by brego and fernndez  @xcite .",
    "brego et al .",
    "@xcite generalized the notion of @xmath62-edges to arbitrary good drawings , as follows .",
    "fix a drawing @xmath66 of @xmath64 and a face @xmath67 of @xmath66 . for an edge @xmath68 of @xmath2",
    ", we arbitrarily choose one of its orientations : here we use @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "for each other vertex @xmath71 , the three vertices @xmath72 induce a 3-cycle  @xmath73 in  @xmath2 . because @xmath2 is a good drawing",
    ", @xmath73 is a simple closed curve in the sphere ( it is slightly simpler technically to consider embeddings in the sphere rather than the plane ) .",
    "as we traverse @xmath73 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 to @xmath71 and back to @xmath69 , @xmath73 has natural right and left sides relative to the directed edge @xmath68 .",
    "assign to @xmath71 the side @xmath74 ( right ) if @xmath27 is on the left side of @xmath73 ; otherwise , assign @xmath75 ( left ) to @xmath71 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath76 , @xmath71 is assigned either @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath68 is a _ @xmath62-edge _ if @xmath62 is the smaller of the number of @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s ( for @xmath68 ) .",
    "note that being a @xmath65-edge is independent of the orientation of the edge @xmath77 as reversing @xmath77 simply exchanges all the labels @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we make one small observation that helps the later discussion : every edge  @xmath80 that has a segment incident with @xmath27 is a 0-edge . to see this ,",
    "suppose some segment @xmath81 of @xmath80 is incident with @xmath27 and we orient @xmath80 so that @xmath27 is to the left of  @xmath81 .",
    "then , for every @xmath71 not incident with @xmath80 , the 3-cycle  determined by @xmath80 and @xmath71 will have @xmath27 on the left side , showing @xmath71 is an @xmath74 .",
    "that is , all vertices are @xmath74 with respect to @xmath80 , so @xmath80 is a 0-edge , as claimed",
    ".      one main ingredient of the proof is the relation between the number of @xmath62-edges and the number of crossings in a drawing .",
    "this relation was shown for rectilinear drawings in @xcite and extended to good drawings in @xcite , where it is shown that the number of crossings of a good drawing can be expressed as a weighted sum of the number of @xmath62-edges of the drawing .",
    "we include this discussion in the appendix , for the sake of completeness .    specifically , if we denote by @xmath82 the number of @xmath62-edges of @xmath2 and consider @xmath83 and @xmath84 in @xcite it is shown that @xmath85 therefore , any lower bound on @xmath86 translates immediately into a lower bound for @xmath11 and , specificaly , showing that @xmath87 implies @xmath88 .",
    "[ lm : inequality ] if a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0 is @xmath62-bishellable and @xmath89 , then @xmath90    since @xmath2 is @xmath91-bishellable , for each @xmath92 , the drawing @xmath2 is @xmath62-bishellable .",
    "therefore , lemma  [ lm : inequality ] implies that @xmath93 as required . plugging these lower bounds into equation",
    "[ eq : twopage ] the desired lower bound of @xmath5 on the number of crossings in @xmath2 follows ( for details see the proof of theorem  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "we essentially follow the ideas of the proofs in  @xcite , but use a simpler and more direct approach provided by the new concept of bishellability .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath62 .",
    "the base case of @xmath94 is trivial , as the face @xmath27 is incident with at least three edges and each of these is a 0-edge .",
    "thus , @xmath95 as required .    for the induction step , let @xmath96 and @xmath97 be sequences witnessing @xmath62-bishellability . consider the drawing @xmath98",
    ". then @xmath99 , @xmath100 show it is @xmath101-bishellable and , since @xmath102 , the induction implies that    @xmath103 rewritten , this is @xmath104    consider an edge @xmath80 in @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath80 is an @xmath105-edge with @xmath106 , then it is either an @xmath105-edge or an @xmath107-edge of @xmath2 , depending on whether @xmath48 joins the majority or minority part of the @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s with respect to @xmath80 in @xmath98 .",

    ", we conclude that @xmath116 as required .",
    "we start with the edges incident with @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath117 and @xmath118 be the two edges incident with @xmath48 so that the corner of the reference face @xmath27 at @xmath48 contains both @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , the fact that @xmath119 shows that we may write the cyclic rotation of the edges incident with @xmath48 as @xmath120 .    to make the discussion uniform , orient all edges incident with @xmath48 away from  @xmath48 .",

    "we arbitrarily choose the orientation of the sphere so that all the vertices not incident with @xmath117 are @xmath74 s for @xmath117 . because deleting @xmath124 puts @xmath125 into the boundary of the ( extended ) reference face",
    ", we see that @xmath125 has at most @xmath105 @xmath75 s and all the rest are @xmath74 s . from this",
    "it is immediate that @xmath125 is an @xmath126-edge , as required .",
    "in particular , letting @xmath127 be that integer such that @xmath125 is a @xmath127-edge , we know @xmath125 contributes @xmath128 to the sum @xmath129 . since @xmath130 , @xmath131 , so @xmath125 contributes at least @xmath111 to the sum .",

    "the invariant edges are determined by the @xmath41 s .",
    "the main point is that @xmath49 is incident with at least @xmath135 invariant edges upon deletion of @xmath48 . to see this",
    ", we observe that if @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the edges incident with  @xmath49 at the corner of @xmath27 incident with @xmath49 then the symmetry @xmath138 in the definition of bishellable drawings implies that the cyclic rotation of edges at @xmath49 can be taken as @xmath139 .",
    "we may choose the labelling of the @xmath140 and @xmath141 so that @xmath142 is not one of @xmath143 .",
    "we know that , for @xmath144 , @xmath140 has only the non-@xmath49 ends of @xmath145 as possible @xmath75 s ( say ) , with the remaining vertices being @xmath74 s .",
    "in particular , @xmath48 is an @xmath74 for all of @xmath143 .",
    "it follows that , for some @xmath130 , @xmath140 is a @xmath127-edge in both @xmath2 and @xmath98 .",
    "that is , @xmath49 is incident with at least @xmath135 invariant edges .",
    "here is the other significant simplification due to bishellability .",
    "the identical argument applies to the vertex @xmath41 in the @xmath146-bishellable drawing @xmath147 , as witnessed by the sequences @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the vertex @xmath41 ( in the role corresponding to @xmath49 in the preceding paragraph ) is incident with at least @xmath150 edges invariant ( relative to @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) .",
    "the values ( @xmath74  or  @xmath75 ) of @xmath153 are , for each of the edges incident with  @xmath41 , independent of whether we consider @xmath151 or @xmath152 . thus , each edge of @xmath151 incident with @xmath41 is a @xmath127-edge of @xmath2 if and only if it is a @xmath127-edge in @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that @xmath2 has , in total , at least @xmath154 invariant edges incident with @xmath97 , as required .",
    "in this section we show that the concept of bishellability is really more general than the concept of shellability , in the sense that there exist bishellable drawings that are not shellable .",
    "we start by considering conditions for drawings to be shellable or bishellable , respectively .",
    "obviously a simple cycle in a drawing @xmath2 made up with at least @xmath155 non - crossed edges guarantees that @xmath2 is shellable and thus also bishellable .",
    "also , a path of @xmath156 non - crossed edges with distinct vertices @xmath157 @xmath158 implies that @xmath2 bishellable .",
    "of course these are sufficient but not necessary conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig : n06 ] shows on the left a bishellable drawing of @xmath159 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are incident to the same cell @xmath27 , but the edge @xmath142 is crossed .",
    "however , this drawing is not harary - hill optimal , as in a harary - hill optimal   drawing for two vertices which are incident to the same cell the connecting edge can always be drawn within this cell without crossings .",

    "have been known , i.e. , for any @xmath161 there exist cylindrical and 2-page book drawings with precisely @xmath5 crossings .",
    "only recently new families of harary - hill optimal   drawings have been discovered . in  @xcite",

    "the edges of the outer cycle remain uncrossed , and thus these drawings are also shellable and bishellable .",
    "the second family is more interesting , as in addition several edges are redrawn in a way so that , for @xmath162 , every edge is crossed by at least one other edge .",
    "it is to some extent counterintuitive that such drawings can be harary - hill optimal ; see  @xcite for more details and figure  [ fig : n11non ] for such a drawing of @xmath8 .",
    "note that in these drawings not only are there no non - crossed edges , but also no two vertices share a common cell .",
    "thus , these drawings can neither be shellable nor bishellable .",
    "so far , this constitutes the only known family of drawings of @xmath0 which is harary - hill optimal  but not bishellable .",

    "it is worthwhile to mention that out of the 421 harary - hill optimal  drawings of @xmath163 this is the only non - bishellable drawing , up to weak isomorphism ( two drawings of @xmath0 are weakly isomorphic if they have the same ( or reversed ) rotation system ) .",
    "the smallest example of a harary - hill optimal  drawing that is not shellable but bishellable is the drawing of @xmath8 shown in figure  [ fig : n11bi ] .",
    "the two sequences @xmath164 and @xmath165 proving bishellability are indicated in the drawing .",
    "the example is symmetric and almost a 2-page book drawing , or a monotone drawing .",
    "there are just two edges of the spine that are crossed and two edges that are non - monotone .",
    "recent progress on the rectilinear crossing number of @xmath0 has depended on making more refined estimates than that provided by lemma  [ lm : inequality ] .",
    "these refinements can not occur in the context of the ( topological ) crossing number considered in this paper , as the bound in lemma  [ lm : inequality ] can not be improved for a drawing having @xmath5 crossings .",
    "also , it is now known that almost half of the more than 400,000 ( up to weakly isomorphism ) harary - hill optimal  drawings of @xmath8 are not shellable , and this almost surely applies in roughly equal numbers to bishellable .",
    "it seems likely that , as @xmath161 grows , the proportion of bishellable harary - hill optimal  drawings vanishes .",
    "however , theorem  [ th : main ] ( indeed theorem [ th : old ] is enough ) implies , for example , that any drawing with @xmath166 drawn in the southern hemisphere ( using an uncrossed @xmath167-cycle on the equator ) and the remaining @xmath166 drawn in the northern hemisphere ( arbitrarily ) must have at least @xmath5 crossings .",
    "these kinds of drawings play a role in the computer - free proof  @xcite that @xmath20 .",
    "+ we close with some open problems :    * can we construct a family of harary - hill optimal  drawings of @xmath0 which are non - shellable , but bishellable , similar to the constructions in  @xcite ?",
    "the drawing of @xmath8 shown in figure  [ fig : n11bi ] might be a good start .",
    "* is there a concept similar to bishellability that does not require the starting vertices of the sequences to share a cell , but still implies at least @xmath5 crossings ? this would mean that each of the two sequences could have their own ( local ) reference faces .",

    "if we consider good drawings of @xmath171 , it is well - known that there are only two such drawings up to spherical homeomorphisms .",
    "however , the one with a crossing has , again up to spherical homeomorphisms , two different faces : one is incident with a 4-cycle and the other is incident with two vertices and the crossing .",
    "it is easy to verify that :    1 .",
    "if @xmath27 is bounded by the 4-cycle , then the four edges of the 4-cycle are all 0-edges while the crossing edges are both 1-edges ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath27 is incident with just two vertices and the crossing , then the two crossing edges are 0-edges , the full edge incident with @xmath27 is a 0-edge , as is its opposite edge in the uncrossed 4-cycle , and the other two edges in the uncrossed 4-cycle are 1-edges ; and 3 .   in the case of the planar drawing of @xmath171 , the three edges incident with @xmath27",
    "are the 0-edges , and the other three edges are the 1-edges .    the preceding paragraph can be used to relate crossings in a drawing @xmath2 of @xmath0 and @xmath62-edges .",
    "each crossing determines a @xmath171 containing precisely two 1-edges ( relative to the face containing the reference face @xmath27 of @xmath2 ) .",
    "each non - crossing @xmath171 contains three 1-edges .",
    "it follows that if we count the number of ordered pairs @xmath172 so that @xmath80 is a 1-edge of this @xmath171 , the total number we get is @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the number of planar @xmath171 s and @xmath175 is the number of non - planar @xmath171 s . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath68 is a @xmath62-edge , and @xmath176 are distinct vertices both different from both @xmath69 and  @xmath70 , then the @xmath171 induced by @xmath177 has @xmath68 as a 1-edge if and only if one of @xmath71 and @xmath178 is an @xmath74 ( relative to @xmath68 ) and the other is an @xmath75 .",
    "if follows that every @xmath65-edge @xmath68 is a 1-edge in @xmath179 different @xmath171 s .",
    "that is , the number of pairs @xmath172 where @xmath80 is a 1-edge of the @xmath171 is @xmath180 where , for @xmath181 , @xmath82 denotes the number of @xmath62-edges in @xmath2 .",
    "the conclusion ( exactly as in  @xcite ) is that @xmath182 on the other hand , @xmath183 is the total number of @xmath171 s in @xmath0 , so @xmath184 multiply equation  ( [ eq : numberk4 s ] ) by @xmath57 , subtract equation  ( [ eq:1-edge ] ) , and use the obvious fact that @xmath185 to conclude that @xmath186 equivalent to the proof of proposition  1 in  @xcite this equation can be rewritten to @xmath187 if we consider @xmath83 and @xmath84 we can get the original formulation in @xcite : @xmath188"
