    "is associated a set of programs , its realizers , which contain computational information about the formula .",
    "while the curry - howard isomorphism draws a correspondence between proofs in a certain logical system and programs in a suitable typed programming language , realizability takes a different approach and defines a realizer as a program which behaves like a proof .",
    "first , this allows to give computational content to the axioms of a theory , and second this allows to choose more freely the programming language , independently from the logical system .",
    "it is even possible to consider untyped programming languages , as was the case in the first realizability model from kleene  @xcite , in which a realizer may be any recursive function .",
    "it is however still possible to consider a typed language , as did kreisel in his modified realizability model  @xcite .",
    "both models from kleene and kreisel gave computational interpretation to heyting arithmetic , the intuitionistic variant of peano arithmetic .",
    "gdel s negative translation  @xcite allowed for the first interpretations of classical logic .",
    "indeed , this translation from classical to intuitionistic logic , when followed by an interpretation of intuitionistic proofs , gives a computational interpretation to classical logic .",
    "this is what we call the indirect interpretation .",
    "this interpretation can easily be extended to arithmetic , and therefore allows to get computational interpretations of peano arithmetic from the models of kleene and kreisel .",
    "much later , griffin discovered in  @xcite that the ` call / cc ` operator of the functional language scheme could be typed with a classical principle : the law of peirce .",
    "this opened the possibility to what we call a direct interpretation of classical logic , using programming languages with control features . following this path , parigot defined in  @xcite the @xmath0-calculus , a language for gentzen s classical sequent calculus extending the curry - howard isomorphism to classical logic .",
    "selinger axiomatized the universal categorical model of @xmath0-calculus in  @xcite .",
    "on another side , krivine considered untyped @xmath2-calculus extended with the ` call / cc ` operator to give a realizability interpretation to classical second - order zermelo - frnkel set theory  @xcite , later extended to handle the axiom of dependent choice  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we define a realizability model for first - order classical logic which , contrary to krivine s and similarly to kreisel s ( but for classical logic ) , uses typed programs as realizers .",
    "we interpret our proofs in the language @xmath3pcf , which is a combination of the functional turing - complete language pcf with the control features of call - by - name @xmath0-calculus . as in krivine s model ,",
    "we associate to each formula a truth value and a falsity value which are orthogonal to each other , but we perform a fine analysis of relativization and introduce positive predicates for which only the truth value is required and prove it to be correct through a suitable restriction on the proofs in our logical system .",
    "we validate our model by proving that the usual terms of gdel s system t realize the axioms of peano arithmetic .",
    "we also implement friedman s trick through the use of an external @xmath3-variable rather than through the replacement of the @xmath4 formula by an existential statement , which allows for a simpler and more effective interpretation .",
    "this variable is also used to define the orthogonality relation between our truth and falsity values .",
    "interpreting the axiom of dependent choice in a classical setting is much more complicated than interpreting arithmetic .",
    "spector defined in  @xcite the bar recursor and used it in gdel s dialectica interpretation  @xcite ( a computational interpretation similar to realizability ) to interpret the axiom of countable choice , and therefore the axiom schema of specification .",
    "this operator was later studied in  @xcite , and a more uniform version was used in  @xcite to give an indirect realizability interpretation of countable choice .",
    "a version with an implicit termination condition was later defined in  @xcite and used to interpret , still in an indirect realizability setting , the double - negation shift principle and therefore the axiom of dependent choice .",
    "we prove here that under some assumptions on our model of @xmath3pcf , the bar recursion operator of  @xcite realizes the axiom of dependent choice in our direct interpretation of classical logic .",
    "our implementation of friedman s trick then allows us to obtain an extraction result on @xmath1 formulas provable in classical analysis ( peano arithmetic + the axiom of dependent choice ) .",
    "we define in this section the logical system under which we will work through the article .",
    "first , we define the general case of classical multisorted first - order logic ( handling classical reasoning by the use of multi - conclusioned sequents ) , then we describe the case of logics with equality , the case of peano arithmetic and its extension with the axiom of dependent choice , and finally we recall some basic definitions about models of classical logic .",
    "the logical framework we use is multisorted first - order logic , where the sorts are fixed to be the types of simply typed @xmath2-calculus ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we build from a set of base sorts @xmath5 the set of sorts : @xmath6 which are used for the individuals of the logic .",
    "we fix a set of sorted individual constants ( ranged over by @xmath7 ) from which we build the set of individuals of the logic : @xmath8 we also fix a set of sorted predicates ( ranged over by @xmath9 ) from which we define the formulas of the logic : @xmath10 the set of sorts , individuals and formulas of the logic is parameterized by a signature :    a signature @xmath11 is a set of base sorts together with a set of sorted constant individuals and a set of sorted predicates .",
    "negation is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "we choose to have only negative connectives , since the interpretation of our logic in categories of continuations defined in section  [ lminterp ] is based on a negative call - by - name continuation - passing - style translation .",
    "the positive connectives are defined from the negative ones : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is well - known that with this coding of positive connectives with negative ones , a formula @xmath15 is provable in our system if and only if the formula obtained by replacing every @xmath16 with @xmath17 in @xmath15 is provable in its intuitionistic restriction . in section  [ relpred ] we will also introduce the notion of negative basic predicates , which are those for which @xmath18 is valid under the realizability interpretation .",
    "we perform a more detailed comparison between our system and the usual ones in section  [ usualtheories ] .    since one of the goals of realizability is to provide a computational interpretation of theories beyond pure first - order logic , our model is dependent upon the particular set of axioms under consideration :    a theory on a given signature @xmath11 is a set @xmath19 of closed formulas ( axioms ) written in the language defined by @xmath11 .",
    "we work in a variant of natural deduction in sequent style , so the interpretation of classical proofs in @xmath0-calculus is as direct as possible . in this",
    "setting , a context @xmath20 or @xmath21 is a finite unordered sequence of formulas and a sequent is of the form : @xmath22 the formula @xmath15 on the right is the formula that is being worked on , and this presentation is again chosen to have an easy interpretation in @xmath0-calculus .",
    "the above sequent should be interpreted as : the conjunction of the formulas of @xmath20 implies the disjunction of @xmath15 and of the formulas of @xmath21 . if @xmath21 is empty we simply write @xmath23 .",

    "here we use a primitive leibniz equality at each type .",
    "in fact , as in  @xcite , we use a primitive inequality rather than an equality , which allows us to realize the leibniz scheme .",
    "moreover , since we are in classical logic , the set of provable sequents is unchanged . in the intuitionistic case however , things are less clear and we discuss it in section  [ usualtheories ] .",

    "it is well known that @xmath77 , so in our system with only negative connectives , @xmath68 and @xmath67 prove exactly the same formulas .",

    "the proof of @xmath78 is obtained by a double induction on @xmath79 and @xmath80 , while in @xmath72 , a proof of @xmath81 can also be obtained through classical logic , in which case its computational content relies on the control features of languages for classical logic ( like @xmath0-calculus ) .",
    "when we switch to higher type equalities , things become more complicated .",
    "indeed , @xmath71 fails to prove @xmath82 , since we can not perform induction on higher type variables , so the systems @xmath71 and @xmath70 are not equivalent anymore , even at the level of provability .    for classical systems @xmath75 and @xmath70 , a formula with equalities and inequalities is provable in @xmath75 ( through the encoding @xmath83 ) if and only if it is provable in @xmath70 ( through the encoding @xmath84 ) .",

    "indeed , some computational models can be naturally seen as categories of continuations for a given @xmath256 , and this @xmath256 may not be isomorphic to the object of natural numbers .",

    "but since there is only one strategy on the one - move arena ( the empty strategy ) , we can not easily define a non - trivial orthogonality relation .",

    "coherent spaces may also satisfy these properties if we choose carefully the object of natural numbers .",

    "interestingly , this bar recursor also gives computational content to the double - negation shift principle in an intuitionistic setting , and that same principle allows to derive intuitionistically the negative translation of the axiom of choice from the axiom of choice .    finally , we validate our model by proving an extraction result for @xmath1 formulas , relying once again on the @xmath3-variable @xmath531 which allows the orthogonality relation to be a parameter of the model .",
