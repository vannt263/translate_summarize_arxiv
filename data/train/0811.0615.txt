    "compelling dynamical evidence indicates that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses ranging from @xmath6 to above @xmath7  @xmath8 reside at the centers of most galactic spheroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the masses of smbhs correlate with various properties of their hosts , e.g. luminosity or mass @xcite and velocity dispersion @xcite . in the currently favored model for structure formation , the @xmath4cdm cosmology , galaxies grow hierarchically through mergers and accretion of smaller systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , if more than one of the merging galaxies contained a smbh , the presence of two or more smbhs in their merger remnant will be almost inevitable during galaxy assembly @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear if the dynamical processes at play are efficient in forming a close smbh pair with separations @xmath9@xmath10  pc , which may subsequently shrink to a bound binary , and eventually merge via gravitational wave radiation .",
    "such black hole coalescence events are expected to give rise to gravitational wave bursts that should be detectable by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "smbh pairing has been shown to proceed quickly when both compact objects are hosted by steep stellar cusps approaching each other from close distances @xcite , or when embedded in a circumnuclear gaseous disk under appropriate thermodynamic conditions @xcite , but whether the large - scale merger can lead the smbhs to such a favorable configuration is still a matter of debate .",
    "previous studies found that , following a galaxy merger , the relative distance of the smbhs in the remnant is very sensitive to the structure of the merging galaxies , and to their initial orbit @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that pairing is efficient in equal - mass disk galaxy mergers with cosmologically relevant orbits , while the presence of a dissipative component is necessary for the pairing of smbhs in @xmath1:@xmath2 mergers .",
    "other recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) focused on the effect of energetic feedback from black hole accretion onto the surrounding galaxy , but were not designed to follow the orbital evolution of smbhs .",
    "substantially less effort has been devoted to examining the fate of smbhs in minor mergers ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are much more frequent in @xmath4cdm cosmologies @xcite .",

    ", we report on the efficiency of the smbh pairing process using a set of @xmath0-body / sph simulations of disk galaxy mergers , with mass ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 , constructed to represent mergers occurring at various cosmic epochs .",
    "the choice of the initial conditions , in particular the masses of the smbhs , is such that the corresponding smbh coalescence events would be detectable with lisa @xcite .",
    "the galaxy models were initialized as three - component systems following the methodology outlined in @xcite .",
    "they comprise a hernquist spherical stellar bulge @xcite , an exponential disk with a gas mass fraction @xmath13 , and an adiabatically contracted dark matter halo @xcite with an initial nfw profile @xcite .",

    "is crucial , because the merger rate increases with look - back time , and a large fraction of the gravitational wave signal from coalescences of smbh binaries is predicted to originate from this cosmic epoch at the corresponding mass scale @xcite .",
    "following mmw , all masses , positions and softening lengths were rescaled by a factor @xmath26 , i.e. the ratio between the hubble constant at @xmath24 and its present - day value for a @xmath4cdm `` concordance '' cosmology ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath28  mpc@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",

    "satellite galaxies were initialized with the same structure , with the mass in each component being scaled down by @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting smbh pairs fall in the typical range of masses whose coalescences will be detectable with lisa @xcite .",
    "we choose orbital parameters for the mergers that are common for merging halos in cosmological simulations @xcite : the baricenters of the two galaxies were placed at a distance equal to the sum of their virial radii and set on parabolic orbits with pericentric distances of @xmath33 the virial radius of the most massive halo .",
    "all mergers we considered were coplanar and prograde .",
    "all simulations were performed with gasoline , a treesph @xmath0-body code @xcite .",
    "we ran collisionless ( `` _ dry _ '' , with @xmath34 ) and gasdynamical ( `` _ wet _ '' ) mergers with the same gas fraction in the primary and secondary galaxies , either @xmath35 or @xmath36 . in wet runs ,",
    "atomic gas cooling was allowed ; star formation ( sf ) was treated according to @xcite .",
    "gas particles are eligible to form stars if their density exceeds 0.1  @xmath37 and their temperature drops below @xmath38  k , and the energy deposited by a type - ii supernova on the surrounding gas is @xmath39  erg . with this choice of parameters",
    "our blast - wave feedback model was shown to produce realistic galaxies in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "a summary of our set of simulations is presented in table [ t : summary ] .    in each galaxy ( except for a very high - resolution test , see [ ss : dry ] ) , we employed @xmath40 particles for the halo , and , initially , @xmath41 star particles and @xmath42 gas particles , when included .",
    "the force softening was 100  pc in our reference model , scaled down by @xmath43 in the satellites , and by @xmath44 in high-@xmath45 runs , yielding a force resolution of @xmath46 pc in the satellite galaxy for @xmath47 at @xmath24 .",
    "with such a high particle number , the masses of star particles in the satellite is an order of magnitude lower than @xmath48 , ensuring that smbh dynamics is not affected by spurious two - body collisions . in what follows",

    "in collisionless runs , the satellite is not able to dissipate energy gained through tidal shocks at pericentric passages @xcite . for @xmath11 ,",
    "dynamical friction on the dark matter halo of the more massive galaxy is efficient , and the satellite sinks down to a few @xmath9 kpc from the center after 3 orbits . at that point the central density of the satellite has decreased considerably because of tidal heating @xcite .",
    "its innermost region is then tidally disrupted , leaving the small smbh at a distance of a few kiloparsecs .",
    "the dynamical friction timescale has now greatly increased , because the mass of the small `` naked '' smbh is orders of magnitude lower than that of the satellite s core that once surrounded it .",
    "no pair is formed , and the smaller smbh is left wandering a few kiloparsecs away from the center of the remnant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) .",
    "we note that estimating correctly the dynamical friction timescale of the smbh from the simulation is not trivial in this regime , because the dark matter component is still dynamically important at kiloparsec distances from the center of the remnant . even at high resolution ,",
    "the mass of the dark matter particles of the primary galaxy is comparable with that of the smbh , hence dynamical friction could be altered by discreteness effects .",
    "however , the dynamical friction timescale needed for the `` naked '' smbh to reach the center of the remnant can be estimated using chandrasekhar s formula @xcite , and it turns out to be longer than a hubble time . hence we conclude that the two smbhs will not form a pair .    in the @xmath47 case ,",
    "dynamical friction is rather ineffective .",
    "the sinking time for the satellite is longer than a hubble time for a @xmath22 merger , owing to the low initial mass of the satellite and to mass loss due to tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "however , since mergers are much more common at higher redshift , when orbital times are shorter by a factor @xmath44 , we performed a @xmath47 merger starting at @xmath24 ( see  [ s : sims ] ) , an epoch at which these smbh pairs are predicted to be most typical .",
    "this is completed in @xmath50 gyr .",
    "similarly to the @xmath11 case , a wandering smbh is left at several kiloparsecs from the center of the primary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) . in order to check that the tidal disruption of the core was not affected by numerical heating",
    ", we ran the same merger with a 5 times higher mass resolution in the stellar component of both galaxies , and correspondingly higher force resolution ; no significant difference in the smbh orbit was found ( tab .",
    "[ t : summary ] ) .",
    "therefore , even in this case the two smbhs do not form a pair .",
    "the presence of a star - forming gaseous component crucially affects the orbital decay of the smbh via its dynamical response to tidal forces and torques .",
    "the orbits of dry and wet , @xmath11 mergers differ only after the first couple of orbits ( @xmath51  gyr , see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) . at second pericenter ,",
    "tidal forces excite a strong bar instability in the satellite .",
    "dissipation in the gas and torques exerted by the stellar bar onto the gas drive a gaseous inflow toward the center of the satellite ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) , increasing the central star formation rate by a factor of @xmath52 . thus , the potential well of the satellite deepens , ensuring resilience of its central part to tidal stripping and shocks even when it plunges near the center of the primary . as a consequence , the small smbh continues to sink fast , because it remains embedded in the massive core of the satellite .",
    "a pair of smbhs is formed in this case , confirming previous results @xcite .    in @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath24 wet mergers , both @xmath35 and 0.3 were employed ; the latter should be a more realistic assumption , since disk galaxies at @xmath24 are believed to have a higher gas mass fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in these cases , star formation and supernovae feedback affect the structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the disks quite dramatically ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the disks develop a clumpy and irregular multi - phase structure , and turbulent velocities of the gas become a significant fraction ( 30% ) of the circular velocity in this mass range ( @xmath53  km  s@xmath28 ) .",
    "star formation in the center of the satellite is enhanced compared to the same model evolved in isolation , even though the star formation rate integrated over the whole galaxy is unchanged ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : new_stars ] ) the concentrated star formation and the turbulent motions of the gas stabilize the disks against bar instability ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) . in the absence of bar - driven torques ,",
    "the strong gaseous inflow seen for higher - mass objects ( @xmath11 ) does not happen for @xmath47 .",
    "yet , tidal torques drive some gas towards the center , explaining the enhanced central star formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : new_stars ] ) . during the first three orbits , the @xmath54 case preserves its initial central density owing to the mild mass inflow , rather than lowering it as in the collisionless case",
    ", while the @xmath55 satellite develops a steeper _ stellar _ cusp .",
    "once the satellites go through the second pericentric passage , their ism is prone to ram pressure stripping by the gas disk of the primary galaxy , outside the ram pressure stripping radius @xcite .",
    "nearly 90% of the gas is swept away when they first enter the disk of the primary , while what remains is stripped during the next orbit : at @xmath56  gyr , the satellites have lost all their gas content , even in their central region . from this point onward , the satellite with initial @xmath55 is a _ cuspy , gas - poor object _ , subject to dynamical friction in the stellar and gaseous background .",
    "its sinking is relatively fast because the steeper stellar density profile implies a larger bound mass , enhancing dynamical friction relative to the dry merger case .",
    "moreover , its response to tidal shocks is nearly adiabatic @xcite , preserving it from tidal disruption . on the contrary ,",
    "the satellite of the @xmath35 run undergoes a slower decay because of the lower bound mass .",
    "it then experiences a higher number of tidal shocks at pericentric passages which further decrease its density , until its complete disruption . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath55 merger leaves the lighter smbh at 70  pc from the more massive one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] , tab .",
    "[ t : summary ] ) in a gas - rich environment , where the dynamical friction timescale for the smbh to sink to the center , based on chandrasekhar s formula , is very short ( @xmath57  gyr ) . instead",
    ", in the @xmath35 case the final distance of the smbhs is @xmath58  pc ; at such separations the dynamical friction timescale is of a few billion years .",
    "hence the pairing will occur within one hubble time in both cases , but will be considerably faster in the @xmath55 case .",
    "our results show that the formation of a smbh pair in unequal - mass mergers of disk galaxies is very sensitive to the details of the physical processes involved . none of the collisionless cases we studied led to smbh pairing : tidal shocks progressively lower the density in the satellite until it dissolves , leaving a wandering smbh in the remnant . the inclusion of gas dynamics and sf changes significantly the outcome of the merger . for higher mass ratios ( @xmath11 ) at @xmath22 ,",
    "bar instabilities funnel gas to the center of the satellite , steepening its potential well and allowing its survival to tidal disruption down to the center of the primary .",
    "therefore , in this case the presence of a dissipative component is necessary and sufficient to pair the smbhs at @xmath59  pc scales , creating favorable conditions for the formation of a binary .",
    "the smaller satellites here considered ( @xmath47 , @xmath24 ) are more strongly affected by both internal sf and the gasdynamical interaction between their ism and that of the primary galaxy .",
    "torques in the early stages of the merger are funnelling the gas to the center less efficiently , due to the absence of a stellar bar and the stabilizing effect of turbulence . as a result ,",
    "ram pressure strips away all of the ism of the satellite .",
    "if satellites develop a higher central stellar density by rapidly converting their gas into stars before ram pressure removes it , they can retain enough bound mass to ensure the pairing of the two smbhs .",
    "gas - rich satellites ( @xmath55 ) undergo a stronger burst of sf during the first orbits , and therefore meet this requirement better than @xmath35 satellites . yet in both cases",
    "the central density of the cusp remains high enough to permit its survival , allowing the pairing of the two smbhs within a hubble time .",
    "the pairing of the two smbhs takes less than @xmath1 gyr in the gas rich systems that should be common at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath60 relation approximately holds at @xmath24 as in the local universe , the galaxies here considered should lead to the formation of representative smbh pairs at such cosmic epochs @xcite .",
    "these pairs are also expected to contribute significantly to the high-@xmath45 gravitational wave signal in the lisa band @xcite . since we show that gas - dynamical processes allow such an efficient pairing of the smbhs , the results of this _ letter _ strengthens the case for the observability of these coalescence events . on the other hand , we show that the timing between galaxy mergers and mergers of their smbhs is sensitive to the gaseous content of the merging galaxies . hence , smbh coalescence events do not necessarily trace galaxy mergers directly .",
    "this will have important implications on the interpretation of the lisa data stream .",
    "we note that the orbital evolution of the smbh pairs , in the dynamical range considered here , has only a weak dependence on the masses of the two smbhs .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : new_stars ] , the stellar mass enclosed inside two softening lengths from the center of our galaxy models ( hence close to our resolution limit ) already exceeds @xmath61 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this is the effective mass that determines how quickly the smbhs will sink .",
    "therefore , lowering @xmath48 or increasing it by up to an order of magnitude would have no effect on sinking timescales _ before _ the disruption of the satellite . instead , _",
    "after _ disruption , the analytic estimate for the dynamical friction timescale of the naked smbh would change linearly with @xmath48 . similarly , if nuclear star clusters with masses @xmath62",
    "@xcite were present around the smbhs , their sinking timescales would still be longer than a hubble time in our dry mergers , where the final smbh separation exceeds 1  kpc , while the pairing would now occur in well below a gyr in _ all _ our wet mergers .",
    "hence , either a larger @xmath48 or the presence of a nuclear star cluster would enhance even further the difference between dry and wet mergers .",
    "lastly , a general limitation of our simulations is that they lack gas accretion onto the smbhs and associated energy feedback .",
    "additional heating from the active smbh should reduce the binding energy of the gas , making it more susceptible to stripping processes , and perhaps inhibiting the formation of a steep stellar cusp .",
    "this would reduce the efficiency of the pairing process , but the effect will strongly depend on when the smbh becomes active during the merger .",
    "although it is unlikely that these effects will change the overall picture presented in this letter , they will have to be explored in a forthcoming paper .",
