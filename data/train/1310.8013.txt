    "<S> in fact , we go further here in the dprm / she context , making additional suggestions regarding experimental signatures of kpz class statistics , examining the interplay of transient & ss regimes and , finally , in the pt - pt tw - gue setting , illustrate the potency of kpz scaling theory  @xcite to inform key aspects of the purely mathematical ulam problem . </S>",
    "<S> we thus return the favor here , reiterating the very fruitful dialog between kpz physics and tw gue mathematics .    in figure 1 , for starters </S>",

    "<S> there is no elastic energy cost in this model , the total energy of the trajectory simply the sum , @xmath18=@xmath19 , of the random energies collected traveling from ( 0,0 ) to ( t , t ) . for our w / e dprm , </S>",
    "<S> we averaged over 4x10@xmath15 paths of length t=400 . next , the numerically demanding iii ) constrained she - it integrations , with kpz parameter @xmath20=10 ; we evolved the system through the forward & rear light cones of the initial & final points of the trajectory , averaging over @xmath21 runs , considering paths of 4000 steps , with time increment @xmath22t=0.05 .     </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , in the following , only @xmath23 and the combination @xmath28=@xmath29 are needed , which we record in table i. an alternative approach , which highlights the utility of cross kpz - class studies emphasized in this paper , involves fixing the kpz scaling parameter @xmath28 directly from a fit , e.g. , to the tw - goe variance and then _ using it in the service of _ both the tw - gue limit distribution , our immediate focus , as well as stationary - state baik - rains pdf , which we consider later . </S>",

    "<S> it was established early on , with much heavy - lifting and the securing of mathematical bounds , but then definitively by vershik & kirov  @xcite , that asymptotically @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this was well - presented by baer & brock , see figure 1 and table 2 of their early paper , where they recorded exact enumerations of the lis pdf for @xmath51 using the rsk correspondence , hook formula , & young tableau mapping  @xcite , complementing these results with approximate monte carlo data reaching up to @xmath49=10@xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> later , it was conjectured by odlyzko & rains , then firmly established by kim , that the standard deviation about this mean scaled as @xmath53 ; i.e. , the ulam - lis problem possessed a well - defined limit distribution in the variable @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> baik , deift , & johansson then proved rigorously that the underlying , asymmetric non - gaussian distribution was , surprisingly , tw - gue from random matrix theory  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , the odlyzko - rains data show a small , but clear , finite - time offset ( they quote @xmath44@xmath571.720 ) in their lis pdf , which only stubbornly disappears as the authors heroically head toward asymptopia , pushing their simulations to @xmath49=10@xmath15 , where @xmath44@xmath571.758 , & beyond ( @xmath49=10@xmath58 ) , nearly closing the gap between themselves and the known tw - gue universal mean : @xmath44=1.7711 . </S>",

    "<S> , we take a different attitude , considering rather short permutation strings , with @xmath49=10@xmath61 - 10@xmath52 , essentially the regime where baer & brock concentrated their numerical enterprise , but invoke kpz scaling wisdom to , nevertheless , pin down very precise values for the moments ; see fig . </S>",

    "<S> given the somewhat priviliged role of the random permutation problem amidst the menagerie of systems obeying tw - gue statistics- it is , by the hook formula , uniquely accessible to exact enumeration for finite @xmath49- we attach somewhat greater significance to this particular additive constant .     1 + 1 _ transient - regime _ & _ stationary - state _ kpz / dprm class : comparison to tw - goe & br - f@xmath10 limit distributions . </S>",

    "<S> more importantly , with regard to 1 + 1 kpz class _ stationary - state statistics , _ and comparison to the baik - rains limit distribution , our dprm / she results , well - matched by single - step , bd , & rsos findings , convincingly establish universality of the seminal png studies of prhofer & spohn  @xcite- note the strong data collapse of our models upon the br - f@xmath10 trace , a highly nontrivial numerical matter . for the g@xmath11 dprm </S>",

    "<S> although the br - f@xmath10 limit distribution itself remained well - beyond the reach of these experiments , takeuchi discovered an impressive precursor signature of the kpz stationary - state , evident as a _ </S>",
    "<S> skewness minimum , _ which we confirm shortly with our own models , establishing its universal kpz aspect . </S>",
    "<S> given the intrinsic importance of the stationary - state dynamics  @xcite , we propose here an alternative signature , relying upon a more statistically tame quantity which , asymptotically , is fixed universally- @xmath78 by the ratio of the tw - goe variance & baik - rains constant . since the _ variance - ratio , _ like the skewness @xmath37 , requires no knowledge of @xmath28 , a quick examination of this quantity in experiments may provide a glimpse of a key universal property of the kpz stationary - state . within figure 2 inset , </S>",
    "<S> we document ( solid symbols ) the scaling of this interesting ratio for g@xmath11 dprm , she - it , and three distinct kpz growth models . </S>",
    "<S> all 5 systems converge convincingly- even the contrarian bd , well known for its curmudgeonly behavior  @xcite . for the she - it case , @xmath76=10k & @xmath71=100 as above , per our rendering of the br distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also include within the inset , data sets associated with lesser values of @xmath76 & hundredfold fewer runs , to study _ crossover effects , _ indicating how this scaling phenomena might appear in a more constrained experimental context . </S>",
    "<S> the black traces , top down , correspond to @xmath76=3 , 20 , 100 , 500 , though all possess @xmath71=100 , with statistical averaging now done  @xcite over a 10@xmath56 , rather than 10@xmath15 points . </S>",
    "<S> the goal here is to provide an extra tack upon the 1 + 1 kpz class _ stationary - state _ </S>",
    "<S> statistics , and to further complement the spectacular experimental results already in hand for the transient _ flat _ tw - goe and _ curved _ tw - gue kpz classes .     </S>",

    "<S> the emergence of the minimum for our she - it integration , revealed as @xmath76 grows from 25 , 50 , to 100 , is manifest within the experiment proper , where the symbols indicate distinct times , smallest to largest , @xmath76=2,6,10,18,30,54,60 , right to left.,width=321 ]    lastly , with figure 3 , we establish _ universality _ of takeuchi s skewness minimum  @xcite , heightening its utility as an experimental precursor signature of the 1 + 1 kpz class stationary - state statistics . for our gaussian dprm , she - it integration , and kpz growth models , </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted up the fluctuation pdf skewness @xmath37 as a function of the dimensionless scaling parameter @xmath79=@xmath80 where , in each case , the numerics are evolved to a time @xmath76 , the skewness then tracked through a subsequent time interval @xmath81 . to consider the consequences of an _ insufficiently mature _ kinetically - roughened state , we include she - it results for @xmath76=25 , 50 , & 100 respectively , shown in the ascending , dashed curves , solid in the last instance . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe how , with increasing @xmath76 , the traces develop to reveal a nearly full - fledged takeuchi minimum ; i.e. , for @xmath76=25 , the skewness min is entirely absent , though the curve possesses a suggestive inflection point . at @xmath76=50 </S>",
    "<S> , the minimum has appeared , but only gains a fuller expression at @xmath76=100 . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that once the skewness minimum has emerged , there is very little movement in its precise location- this is especially true of the @xmath82 ordinate , slightly less so for its abscissa . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution , with increasing @xmath76 , of the universal kpz class skewness minimum is tied primarily to its _ curvature _ and , in the 1 + 1 dimensional case , to the steepening slope for @xmath83 , as @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we mention , in passing , that our she - it , single - step , and rsos simulations share a common _ nonuniversal behavior _ at very early @xmath81 , which gives rise to a _ model - dependent _ maximum and subsequent ( @xmath85 ) monotonic decrease in @xmath86 , evident in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , this peculiar feature is actually manifest within takeuchi s  @xcite liquid - crystal kpz experimental data set proper ( ! ) , shown as an inset within figure 3 and contrasts , intriguingly , with his own png simulation results , which indicate a weakly divergent , _ increasing _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 for the smallest @xmath79 values  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these system - dependent details are small , but curious matters , slightly off - stage , but nevertheless quite apparent to those involved in the nuts & bolts of simulation . from an experimental point of view </S>",
    "<S> , however , the takeuchi minimum itself is the essential focus and sits center - stage , providing a _ crucial , tell - tale precursor signature of 1 + 1 kpz class stationary - state statistics . </S>",
    "<S> _ hence , see figure 3 , our g@xmath11 dprm results , for which we have devoted the greatest numerical investment , making a 1/4 million runs in a system size l=10@xmath52 , resulting in a data set of 2.5 billion samples . included , too , in the figure itself , as well as the inset , is takeuchi s skewness spline ( black traces ) , carefully crafted via his png work . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between takeuchi s png spline and our mix of kpz data sets , and that of the g@xmath11 dprm in particular , is quite suggestive , indeed . from our simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we locate the takeuchi minimum at @xmath82=0.225@xmath640.005 , for @xmath79=@xmath87=4.5@xmath640.4 . </S>",
    "<S> we note , that the nonuniversal behavior at small @xmath85 evident in takeuchi s png simulation , giving rise to a climbing , positive @xmath37 is , in fact , shared by our g@xmath11 dprm and bd models . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it is only in the double limit , @xmath84 , then @xmath88 , with @xmath89 that an interpolating skewness spline , originating at the tw - goe value , @xmath67=0.2935 , for large @xmath90 , would descend through the takeuchi minimum at the sweetspot near @xmath91 , then exhibit the correct asymptotic approach to the stationary - state baik - rains value , @xmath74=0.35941 , for vanishing small @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> to manifest the latter would be quite difficult , even numerically . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we mention that the _ kurtosis minimum _ we find for the g@xmath11 dprm , at @xmath93=0.117 , is quite near takeuchi s png value for this more demanding , higher cumulant ratio . given the tougher statistics , as well as the smaller difference here between the tw - goe kurtosis , @xmath94=0.1652 , and our measured k@xmath95 , eliciting this delicate feature experimentally will remain , no doubt , a most challenging task . in the interim , we await a clever experimental implementation of the kpz _ stationary - state _ initial condition , which might allow _ direct _ access to the baik - rains f@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> given the universality established via figure 2 , with our dprm / she , single - step , bd , and rsos results , this limit distribution represents , most assuredly , the relevant fixed point pdf . </S>"
