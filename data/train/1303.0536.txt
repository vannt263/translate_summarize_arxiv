    "the considerable efforts have been devoted to the control of vibrating structures in various fields of fundamental and applied sciences .",

    "the amplitude peak of the parametric resonance can be reduced by means of a correct choice of the time - delay and the feedback gain .",
    "we discussed how the existence region of steady - state solutions is modified by the feedback control and we showed the existence regions of the nontrivial solution in the plane of the parametric excitation amplitude and the detuning parameter for an uncontrolled system , a controlled system without time - delay , and those with time - delays corresponding to the minimum and maximum values of an appropriate equivalent damping .",
