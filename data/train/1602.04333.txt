    "in the great majority of the theoretical studies of the scattering of light from a two - dimensional randomly rough surface of a dielectric medium , the medium of incidence has been vacuum .",
    "recent reviews of such studies can be found in refs . and . as a result of this restriction ,",
    "effects associated with total internal reflection , which requires that the medium of incidence be optically more dense than the scattering medium , were not considered in these studies .",
    "there have been exceptions to this general practice , however .    by the use of the stochastic functional approach @xcite , kawanishi  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the coherent and incoherent scattering of an electromagnetic wave from a two - dimensional randomly rough interface separating two different dielectric media",
    ". the light could be incident on the interface from either medium .",
    "the theoretical approach used in this work @xcite is perturbative in nature , and applicable only to weakly rough interfaces .",
    "nevertheless its use yielded interesting results , including the presence of yoneda peaks in the angular dependence of the intensity of the light scattered back into the medium of incidence when the latter was the optically more dense medium .",
    "these are sharp , asymmetric peaks occurring at the critical angle for total internal reflection for a fixed angle of incidence for both p- and s - polarization of the incident light .",
    "these peaks were first observed experimentally in the scattering of x - rays incident from air on a metal surface @xcite and have subsequently been studied theoretically in the context of the scattering of x - rays  @xcite and neutrons @xcite from rough surfaces .    in ref .",
    ", kawanishi  _ et al . _  also observed angles of zero scattering intensity , to first order in their approach , in the distributions of the intensity of the incoherently scattered light , when the incident light was p - polarized . due to their resemblance to the brewster angle in the reflectivity from a flat interface , they dubbed these angles the `` brewster scattering angles '' .",
    "these were observed , in both reflection and transmission , for light incident from either medium .",
    "both the yoneda peaks and the brewster scattering angles seem to have had their first appearance in optics in the paper by kawanishi  _ et al . _",
    "they have yet to be observed experimentally in this context .",
    "it should be mentioned that in an earlier numerical investigation of light scattering from one - dimensional dielectric rough surfaces , nieto - vesperinas and snchez - gil  @xcite observed `` sidelobes '' in the angular intensity distributions . however , these authors did not associate these features with the yoneda peak phenomenon , even though we believe doing so would have been correct .    in a subsequent paper soubret  _ et al .",
    "@xcite derived a reduced rayleigh equation for the scattering amplitudes when an electromagnetic wave is incident from one dielectric medium on its two - dimensional randomly rough interface with a second dielectric medium .",
    "the solution of this equation was obtained in the form of expansions of the scattering amplitudes in powers of the surface profile function through terms of third order . however , in obtaining the numerical results presented in this paper  @xcite , the medium of incidence was assumed to be vacuum .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of this problem free from some of the restrictive assumptions and approximations present in the earlier studies of scattering of polarized light from two - dimensional randomly rough dielectric surfaces .",
    "we first derive a reduced rayleigh equation for the scattering amplitudes when p- or s - polarized light is incident from a dielectric medium whose dielectric constant is @xmath1 , on its two - dimensional randomly rough interface with a dielectric medium whose dielectric constant is @xmath2 .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath1 can be smaller or larger than @xmath2 .",
    "this equation is then solved by a rigorous , purely numerical , nonperturbative approach .",
    "the scattering amplitudes obtained in this way are then used to calculate the reflectivity and reflectance of the interface as a function of the angle of incidence , and also the effect of surface roughness on the contribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient from the light scattered incoherently ( diffusely ) , and the full angular dependence of the intensity of the incoherently scattered light .",
    "it is hoped that the presentation of these results will stimulate and motivate experimental studies of such scattering systems .",
    "the system we study in this paper consists of a dielectric medium ( medium 1 ) , whose dielectric constant is @xmath1 , in the region @xmath3 , and a dielectric medium ( medium 2 ) , whose dielectric constant is @xmath2 , in the region @xmath4 [ fig .",

    "[ fig : reflectivity](b ) showed a stronger peak for @xmath253 just beyond the critical angle @xmath218 than the curve for s - polarization : less light is scattered incoherently for these angles when the incident light is p - polarized than when it is s - polarized .",

    "these equations enable a non - perturbative solution of the scattering problem based on the rayleigh hypothesis . as an example of its solution by purely numerical means , the full angular distributions for both co- and",
    "cross - polarized incoherent components of the mean differential reflection coefficients were reported , for configurations of vacuum and an absorptionless dielectric with a gaussian surface power spectrum and correlation function .",
    "it was shown that a configuration of reflection within the optically denser medium leads to yoneda peaks in the angular distributions of the diffusely scattered light , namely peaks at the critical angle for total internal reflection in the denser medium .",
    "the behaviour and development of these peaks for a wide range of angles of incidence and scattering were investigated , and the lack of such peaks for light scattered into p - polarization for polar angles of incidence smaller than the critical angle were explained through small amplitude perturbation theory ( sapt ) .",
    "brewster scattering angles , angles where scattering into p - polarization is suppressed to strict zero in sapt to lowest non - zero order in the surface profile function , were found to explain many of the differences in scattering into s- and p - polarization for the scattering systems investigated in the current work .",
    "these angles were first mentioned in the literature by kawanishi  _ et al . _  in ref .  .",
    "our results are in good agreement with their findings .",
    "small amplitude perturbation theory , to lowest non - zero order in the surface profile function , was overall shown to reproduce our numerical results qualitatively to a fairly high degree of accuracy , both through analytical arguments and a numerical implementation of that theory .",
    "this leads us to believe that the features presented in the results are single - scattering effects .",
    "the scattering of light from a transparent dielectric is well described by solutions obtained by means of small amplitude perturbation theory , including the full angular distribution of the mean drc for all combinations of the polarizations of the incident and scattered light .",
    "the reduced rayleigh equation is a powerful starting point for studies of higher - order scattering features , such as enhanced backscattering , for example .",
    "the results presented here show that for the degree of surface roughness and the values of the dielectric constants assumed in this work no higher - order features are observed .",
    "nevertheless , the rre still gives more accurate numerical results for the mean drc than does sapt to lowest nonzero order in the surface profile function when the surface roughness is increased .",
    "as an investigation of the quality of the results , energy conservation ( unitarity ) was found to be satisfied within @xmath0 when the total scattered energy from both reflection and transmission was added together , for the roughness parameters and configurations used in this paper .",
