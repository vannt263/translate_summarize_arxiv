    "the interesting new results on the threshold and the further pattern of anomalous  suppression @xcite make it appropriate to take stock of what we can say about the onset of deconfinement in nuclear collisions and what we can predict for the forthcoming rhic experiments .",
    "the aim of this survey is therefore to formulate the conditions for deconfinement , use the sps results to determine the crucial onset parameters , and then calculate what should be seen at rhic .",
    "finite temperature qcd predicts that strongly interacting matter will undergo a transition at @xmath1 ; at this point , hadronic matter , as the colour insulator phase of qcd , turns into the colour - conducting quark - gluon plasma .",
    "to throw some light on how and why this happens , we begin with a study of physical patterns for deconfinement .      for an infinite bare quark mass",
    ", the qcd lagrangian leads to pure colour @xmath2 gauge theory . here",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath3 provides an order parameter suitable to define the confinement - deconfinement phase transition , driven by the underlying center @xmath4 symmetry of the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "confined states share this symmetry , but it is spontaneously broken in the deconfined phase .",
    "spin systems , in particular the @xmath5-state potts model ( @xmath5=2 is the ising model ) , show the same kind of critical behaviour , based on the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath6 symmetry , with the ` magnetisation ' @xmath7 as order parameter . this similarity has led to the conjecture that the two systems are in fact in the same universality class of critical behaviour @xcite , which is indeed",
    "nicely confirmed in lattice studies @xcite .",
    "to arrive at an alternative physical definition of deconfinement , we will make use of the relation between spin and gauge systems .",
    "the critical behaviour of the ising model can today be characterized either as    * spontaneous magnetisation , i.e. , as a disorder / order transition connected to the spontaneous @xmath8 symmetry breaking for @xmath9 , or as * percolation of clusters of parallel spins joined by suitable bonds , i.e. , in terms of the geometric onset of the new phase .",
    "these two descriptions have been shown to be completely equivalent , leading to the same critical temperature and the same critical exponents @xcite .",
    "since the percolation approach to the critical behaviour of spin systems is fairly new , we briefly sketch its basic features . for simplicity , consider a two - dimensional square lattice of linear size @xmath10 ; on the @xmath11 sites , we distribute an equal number of up and down spins according to the ising hamiltonian @xmath12 . with decreasing temperature @xmath13",
    ", adjacent sites of parallel spins will begin to form growing clusters , and for @xmath14 , either the up or the down spins will percolate , i.e. , form an infinite cluster in the thermodynamic limit @xmath15 .",
    "we thus can define the percolation strength p(t )",
    "~(1 - t t_c)^_p ,  t t_c , [ 1.1 ] which measures the probability that an arbitrary site belongs to the infinite cluster .",
    "since @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and non - zero for all @xmath18 , it constitutes an order parameter for percolation . although the critical temperature @xmath19 for this transition coincides ( in two dimensions ) with the curie temperature ,",
    "the critical exponents in general do not . to achieve complete equivalence , including identical critical exponents , the definition of cluster has to be modified such that percolation clusters coincide with the correlation clusters obtained in the ising model @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by assigning to pairs of adjacent aligned spins in a geometric cluster an additional bond correlation , randomly distributed with the density n_b = 1 - e^-2j / kt , [ 1.2 ] where @xmath20 just corresponds to the energy required for flipping an aligned into a non - aligned spin .",
    "the modified percolation clusters then consist of aligned spins which are bond connected .",
    "only for @xmath21 are all aligned spins bonded ; for @xmath22 , some aligned spins in a purely geometric cluster are not bonded and hence do not belong to the modified cluster .",
    "this effectively reduces the size of a given cluster of aligned spins or even cuts it into several modified clusters . with such a cluster definition ,",
    "cluster percolation and spontaneous magnetisation become fully equivalent as critical phenomena .",
    "we now want to extend the percolation definition of critical behaviour to deconfinement in @xmath23 gauge theory , where we consider clusters of positive ( or negative ) polyakov loops @xmath24 instead of up or down spin clusters ; here @xmath25 denotes the space position of the polyakov loop .",
    "first studies have been carried out in two space dimensions @xcite , using n_b = 1 - e^-2 l_il_j [ 1.3 ] as bond weight between the ( same - sign ) polyakov loops @xmath24 and @xmath26 on adjacent spatial lattice sites @xmath25 and @xmath27 . the effective coupling @xmath28 is known for small temporal lattices @xcite ; we therefore employ for our first study @xmath29 .",
    "using finite size scaling to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit of large systems , our study provides two main results :    * the percolation coupling (  temperature \" ) coincides with the deconfinement value obtained using the expectation value of the polyakov loop as order parameter ; and * the critical exponents for percolation strength and cluster size coincide with the ising values predicted by the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture for @xmath23 thermodynamics .    for",
    "the specific system studied [ @xmath23 gauge theory , two space dimensions , @xmath29 ] , we thus find that deconfinement can be specified in terms of polyakov loop percolation @xcite with as good or better precision than through the spontaneous symmetry breaking measured by polyakov loop expectation values @xcite .",
    "the next steps in this program are quite clear ",
    "one has to extend @xmath31 to arbitrary values and consider also systems in three space dimensions ; then the entire study has to be repeated for @xmath32 gauge theory .",
    "one particular advantage of specifying deconfinement in terms of percolation is that this appears readily generalizable to full qcd @xcite . in the presence of dynamical quarks , the global @xmath6 symmetry of the pure gauge theory lagrangian",
    "is explicitly broken , so that in full qcd the expectation value of the polyakov loop no longer serves as an order parameter for a transition  it is always non - vanishing , even though it continues to vary rapidly in a    ( 16,9.4 ) ( -0.1,9 )    narrow temperature range .",
    "in contrast , the percolation strength @xmath33 remains an order parameter ( for the percolation transition ) even for finite quark mass @xmath34 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the ising model with non - vanishing external field @xmath35 ; here there is also no more spontaneous symmetry breaking , with the magnetisation @xmath36 for all @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , the percolation transition persists for all values of the temperature , tracing a curve @xmath37 of critical temperature ( the so - called ` kertsz line ' [ 8,12 ] ) in the @xmath38 plane .",
    "its counterpart in qcd defines the deconfinement diagram shown in fig .  1 , separating the confined and the deconfined phase by a line of genuine ( percolation ) critical behaviour , not just by a rapid cross - over .",
    "it is obviously of great interest to see if this transition occurs at those temperature values where the expectation value of the polyakov loop shows its rapid variation .",
    "moreover , the relation between the percolation transition and the chiral transition at @xmath39 poses an interesting open problem .",
    "( 9.5,-.2 ) ( 9.5,-1.2 )    [ fig11 ]      in media so dense that several hadrons overlap , the ` other ' colour charges screen the binding forces between the quarks of any given hadron . as a result ,",
    "the constituents of the medium become deconfined , since screening suppresses the long - range confining potential r r ( 1-e^-r r ) , [ 1.4 ] in a form similar to the debye screening of the coulomb potential .",
    "the screening mass @xmath40 is the inverse of the screening radius ; it increases with temperature , so that the range of the potential decreases , and eventually deconfinement sets in .",
    "finite temperature lattice qcd determines the critical temperature for deconfinement ; it also indicates that @xmath41 gev . with 0.3 - 0.5 fm ,",
    "the critical colour screening radius is therefore considerably smaller than the separation between quarks inside a hadron ( about 1.5 - 2 fm ) .",
    "colour screening provides a probe of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "sufficiently small bound states will not melt directly at the deconfinement point ; they require a shorter screening radius and hence a hotter quark - gluon plasma to be dissociated @xcite .",
    "hence quarkonia can be used to to measure the temperature of deconfining media .",
    "as example , consider charmonium dissociation .",
    "the screening masses for the dissociation of the ( 3.5 ) and the ( 3.1 ) are about 0.35 gev and 0.70 gev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the  thus melts essentially at deconfinement , while the  requires a somewhat higher temperature .",
    "similar arguments show that the  melts at a very much higher temperature . for quarkonium states in a uniform medium",
    "we thus obtain a hierarchy of suppression .",
    "summarizing the first section of this survey , we note    * percolation provides a natural specification and a prospective general order parameter for the onset of deconfinement ; * the dissociation of quarkonia by colour screening signals deconfinement and serves as thermometer of the deconfined medium .    in the following section",
    ", we turn to percolation in nuclear collisions and to the resulting suppression of  and direct  production .",
    "in a high energy nuclear collision viewed in the overall center of mass , the two lorentz - contracted nuclei quickly pass through each other .",
    "after about 1 fm at the sps and only about 0.1 fm at rhic , they have separated and left behind the partonic medium which is our potential qgp candidate . inside this medium , primary nucleon - nucleon collisions have left probes , such as heavy quark pairs or drell - yan dileptons , whose fate can provide information about the state of the partonic medium .",
    "the average number of produced partons will depend on the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions and/or the number of participating ( ` wounded ' ) nucleons .",
    "up to sps energies , the number of wounded nucleons appears to be the main determining factor @xcite .",
    "this is understandable in terms of the dilated and hence large soft parton formation time as seen in the rest frame of either nucleus .",
    "interference and cancellation effects of the landau - pomeranchuk type thus prevent soft parton emission at each nucleon - nucleon collision . at higher energies",
    ", large additional contributions can come from hard partons ( minijets or jets ) with short formation time , and these will be proportional to the number of collisions . even at sps energy , nucleon stopping and secondary multiplicities at mid - rapidity seem to increase somewhat with increasing mass number @xmath42 , and this could be the onset of collision dependent effects .",
    "the @xmath43-dependence of the mid - rapidity multiplicity is presumably a combination of the @xmath43-dependence of the parton distribution function and the onset of significant hard hadron production .",
    "we shall try to include these dependences here in rather phenomenological terms , without specifying their origin .",
    "the number of gluons of transverse momentum @xmath44 emitted by a wounded nucleon can be estimated using the nucleonic gluon distribution function @xmath45 from deep inelastic scattering studies , ( dn_gdy dk_t^2 ) _",
    "y=0 xg(x ) f(k_t^2 ) [ 2.1 ] where we have assumed factorization of the parton distribution in @xmath46 and @xmath44 , and taken @xmath47 as normalized to unity . at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the incident collision energy . using the mrs - h form of the gluon distribution function @xcite and integrating the resulting eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) over @xmath44 then gives us @xmath51 for sps and 4 for rhic energy .",
    "each parton of transverse momentum @xmath44 has an effective transverse size @xmath52 , and nucleus - nucleus collisions provide many such partons overlapping in the transverse plane .",
    "we want to study their percolation behaviour . to simplify matters , we shall consider ` average ' partons ( rather than averaging results with @xmath47 ) .",
    "from the transverse momentum dependence of drell - yan dilepton production through quark - antiquark annihilation , or from that of  production through gluon fusion , we know that the effective intrinsic transverse momentum of partons is @xmath53 gev / c , leading to an average transverse parton radius @xmath54 fm .",
    "we now consider the percolation pattern for discs of that size .    as a prelude",
    ", we assume @xmath5 discs of radius @xmath55 to be randomly distributed on a flat surface of radius @xmath56 and study the average cluster density @xmath57 and the average cluster size @xmath58 as a function of the overall density @xmath59 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] , where we have normalized all quantities to the inverse disc area @xmath60 in order to make them dimensionless .",
    "we note that the derivative of the cluster density peaks sharply at a certain density ; in the ` thermodynamic ' limit @xmath61 , it diverges at the percolation point @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we see in particular that if we want to reach a certain cluster density @xmath63 , attained at a certain overall @xmath64 , then at this point the average cluster @xmath65 also has a certain finite size . in other words , requiring a specific density for the onset of a new phase implies that this onset occurs for a specific finite fractional size of the system .",
    "the percolation point , for example , is reached when about 50% of the surface is covered by discs .",
    "turning now to nuclear collisions , we have to distribute the partonic discs not on a flat surface , but instead in the transverse plane according to the nucleon distribution determined by the profiles of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have to allow collisions at different impact parameters , and we want to consider different @xmath66 collisions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] , the cluster density @xmath63 is shown as function of the overall density @xmath67 of ` average ' partons of radius @xmath68 fm , for different centralities of various @xmath66 combinations , all at sps energy , where we take 2 partons per wounded nucleon . for each @xmath66 , the point",
    "at highest @xmath67 corresponds to central ( impact parameter @xmath69 ) collisions , the one at lowest @xmath67 to the most peripheral collisions possible .",
    "we note that by varying @xmath66 and centrality we produce an essentially universal cluster density @xmath70 .",
    "now we assume that deconfinement occurs at the percolation point , which can be determined by studying the average fractional cluster size @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ fig23 ] , we see the result for @xmath72 collisions . at the density for which the derivative peaks , @xmath73 @xmath74 , the cluster density reaches its critical value @xmath75 @xmath74 .",
    "the same critical value is found for @xmath76 and @xmath77 collisions at sps energy , even though this value is attained at quite different centrality in the different configurations ( @xmath78 fm for @xmath76 , 8.5 fm for @xmath72 and 10 fm for @xmath77 collisions ) .    in fig s .",
    "[ fig24 ] and [ fig25 ] , we show the result of this procedure for rhic energy , where we have 4 gluons per wounded nucleon . again the critical cluster density at deconfinement is found to be @xmath75 @xmath74 .",
    "here we have to consider @xmath79 collisions in order to study the onset of deconfinement , since for @xmath80 all possible centralities are above the threshold .",
    "we thus conclude that the critical cluster density is , as expected , a universal quantity , independent of the choice of @xmath66 , of centrality , and of incident energy .",
    "the fractional size of the deconfined cluster at threshold does , however , depend on the collision configuration : for @xmath72 at sps , we have @xmath81 , while @xmath79 at rhic gives 0.70 . in other words , at the higher rhic energy , deconfinement sets in for a larger bubble than at the lower sps energy .",
    "we further note that at sps energy , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are below the deconfinement threshold even for the most central collisions , while at rhic even the most peripheral @xmath72 collisions are above the threshold . to study the threshold , we thus require heavy nuclei ( such as @xmath84 ) at the sps , lighter nuclei ( such as @xmath85 ) or lower incident energy at rhic .",
    "having specified the onset of deconfinement through percolation , we now turn to deconfinement signatures .",
    "as noted above , the  is dissociated essentially at deconfinement , so when the cluster density reaches @xmath86 @xmath74 , all s which are inside the percolating cluster disappear .",
    "the amount of  suppression thus depends on the fractional cluster size at deconfinement , which is about 45 % for @xmath80 at the sps , about 70 % for @xmath87 at rhic and effectively 100 % for @xmath80 at rhic . at deconfinement ,",
    "the corresponding fractions of  production through intermediate  states should thus be suppressed .",
    "as already noted , the dissociation of directly produced s requires a a larger screening mass and thus higher density than available at the point of deconfinement . on a microscopic level ,",
    "break - up becomes possible only for harder than the average gluons at deconfinement . in principle , the relevant quantities can be determined by lattice qcd studies ; however , this requires computer capabilities which are being reached only now . for the time",
    ", we therefore choose @xmath88 fm and @xmath89 @xmath74 ; this corresponds to a ratio of transverse dissociation energy densities @xmath90 , in accord in studies combining potential theory and lattice results @xcite . with these parameters ,",
    "one obtains 20% direct  suppression in @xmath72 collisions at sps energy , once the required cluster density is reached .",
    "the corresponding fractions for rhic are 30% for @xmath79 and 35% for @xmath72 collisions .",
    "schematically , one thus obtains a suppression pattern as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig26 ] , where it is assumed that 40% of the observed s come from  decay and 60% are produced directly . for clarity purposes ,",
    "we ignore here the small fraction ( about 8% ) coming from   decay .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to the suppression which would take place in a uniform medium of precisely specified parton density : at the deconfinement point , all s are dissociated , so that the corresponding fraction of decay s is gone ; when the density for direct  melting is reached , these disappear as well , leading to complete  suppression . in actual nuclear collisions ,",
    "the medium is not uniform , with denser ` inner ' and less dense ` outer ' regions in the transverse plane .",
    "suppression now occurs only in the fraction @xmath91 for the  part and @xmath92 for the direct  part , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the clusters in which the respective dissociation density is reached .",
    "since these fractions depend on energy and nuclear geometry , the suppression curves are different for different experimental configurations . in fig .",
    "[ fig26 ] , the result is shown for @xmath72 collisions at the sps , from impact parameter @xmath95 fm to @xmath69 fm .",
    "the difference between this curve and the one for a uniform medium thus reflects the surviving s produced in the less dense outer regions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig27 ] , similar calculations are shown for @xmath72 and @xmath79 at rhic energy . here we note in particular that @xmath72 collisions are for all meaningful centralities ( @xmath96 fm ) above both the  and the direct  threshold , so that we get a smooth anomalous suppression increasing from about 60% at @xmath95 fm to about 90% at @xmath69 . combining this suppression with",
    "the ` normal ' pre - resonance absorption in nuclear matter , we thus predict for central @xmath72 collisions at rhic a  production rate of less than 5% the corresponding unsuppressed rate ( excluding possible @xmath97 decay contributions ) . it should also be noted that this result is based on twice the number of gluons per wounded nucleon at rhic , compared to the sps value .",
    "a larger increase , based on a possible larger hadron multiplicity at rhic , would lead to more  suppression .",
    "similarly , we assume an average number @xmath98 of gluons per wounded nucleon .",
    "it is conceivable that very central collisions reach into the tail part of the multiplicity distribution , with a larger number of hadrons and hence also gluons .",
    "this would lead to a larger suppression for very central collisions . at the sps",
    ", the na50 collaboration can check if the basis for this exists . by combining measurements of hadron multiplicity , transverse energy @xmath99 and forward energy @xmath100 , it is possible to study the number of hadrons per wounded nucleon as function of @xmath99 and check if there is an increase at highest @xmath99 values .",
    "finally we address briefly the comparison of our results on parton percolation to the @xmath99-dependence of the actual data , which contain an additional smearing due to the fact that a given @xmath99 bin corresponds to a range of impact parameters and hence parton densities . including this effect in the standard way @xcite",
    ", we obtain the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig29 ] . included in this figure are the 1997 @xcite and the 1998 data @xcite with minimum bias determined drell - yan reference .",
    "the high @xmath99 points of the 1997 data show an enhancement due to rescattering effects , which are removed in the 1998 data using a thinner target . while reproducing the overall behaviour",
    ", our results clearly show deviations from the data in detail .",
    "as mentioned , the levelling - off of our curve at high @xmath99 would have to be modified if an increase in the multiplicity per wounded nucleon at high @xmath99 should be observed .",
    "another possible modification could enter through a density - dependent charmonium dissociation .",
    "we have here assumed that all s melt once the critical density is reached . allowing a partial survival chance , which decreases with increasing density , would lead to a steeper drop of the suppression with @xmath101 as well as with @xmath99 .",
    "one possible source for such an effect would be the finite life - time of the deconfining medium in actual nuclear collision , as seen e.g.  in the parton cascade model to be discussed in the next section .    summarizing this section",
    ", we note that parton percolation provides a consistent framework to study the onset of deconfinement as well as the onset of charmonium suppression as a signature of the transition .",
    "it is clear that the compatibility of the parton basis with other , soft hadron production processes has to be checked @xcite .",
    "probing deconfinement in nuclear collisions means studying the early partonic medium left behind when the lorentz - contracted nuclei have passed through each other  a medium consisting of partons , of strings , of flux tubes , or of whatever basis is chosen .",
    "any model of this type has to      in the past section , we had chosen a purely geometric framework , with deconfinement defined as percolation of partons of transverse radius @xmath102 , and with a given ( energy - dependent ) number of partons emitted from each wounded nucleon . in this section , we want to consider a more detailed microscopic model , based on the interaction of partons and the resulting evolution of the partonic medium @xcite . for this , we shall use the parton cascade model @xcite ; but evidently one could also use other approaches , such as hijing @xcite or the dual parton model @xcite .",
    "all such models provide a parton or string distribution in the transverse plane and thus in principle constitute an alternative to the nuclear profile pattern we had used in the previous section .",
    "the time evolution of such a distribution from the parton cascade model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig31b ] and compared to the nuclear profile pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig32 ] .",
    "it is seen there that the parton cascade model in fact provides a transverse parton distribution very similar to that based on the distribution of wounded nucleons .",
    "the parton cascade model describes the partonic medium before the onset of confinement . to determine when confinement sets in for such a medium ,",
    "we calculate the screening mass @xmath40 and recall that lattice qcd finds @xmath103 gev at the deconfinement point .",
    "the screening mass is given by @xcite ^2 = -3 _ s ^2 d^3 k f(k ) , [ 3.1 ] where @xmath104 specifies the momentum distribution of the partons . for a bose - einstein distribution , with @xmath105 , eq .  ( [ 3.1 ] ) gives the familiar @xmath106 obtained in perturbative qcd .",
    "instead , we now insert for @xmath104 the time - dependent distribution function @xmath107 from the parton cascade model , in order to obtain the non - equilibrium time evolution of the screening mass .",
    "first preliminary results for central @xmath72 collisions at rhic are given in fig .",
    "[ fig33 ] , indicating the variation of @xmath40 as function of the proper medium life - time after full nuclear overlap and as function of the transverse radius of the medium . to interpret this behaviour ,",
    "recall that deconfinement as well as  dissociation occurs for @xmath108 0.4 - 0.6 gev , while the dissociation of directly produced s requires 0.7 gev .",
    "hence for essentially all production regions , our preliminary results for the screening mass exceed the necessary dissociation values for both  and  for some time . in accord with the results from parton percolaton , this would seem to indicate almost complete  suppression for central @xmath72 collisions at rhic . to really conclude this",
    ", however , one must first specify how long @xmath40 has to exceed its critical value in order to ` melt ' the charmonium state in question . in any case",
    ", for really quantitative precision more extensive calculations are necessary .",
    "let us finally note one particular advantage of microscopic evolution picture such as the parton cascade model .",
    "once we have defined the conditions for quarkonium suppression , be it through percolation or through colour screening , the parton cascade model can be used to check if the conditions needed for the observed suppression lead to consistent soft hadron production at the later times . such models thus provide a bridge between the early deconfined and the later hadronic stages .",
    "the situation is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig34 ] , which also serves as our conclusion .",
    "it shows on one hand the general evolution of the collision , on the other the effect of this evolution on charmonium production as hard probe of the early medium .",
