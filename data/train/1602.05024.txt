    "this is witnessed by recent activity in non - equilibrium ( classical and quantum ) physics that revolves around the work and the laws of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we recall the definition of the thermodynamic work and its features .",
    "consider a non - relativistic particle with coordinate @xmath0 , canonic momentum @xmath1 and hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an external field .",
    "the thermodynamic work done on the particle by the field s source in the time - interval @xmath4 $ ] is @xcite : @xmath5 @xmath6 equals the energy increase of the particle .",
    "no work is done if @xmath7 is time - independent .",
    "definition ( [ eq:00 ] ) generalizes to statistical situations , where the description goes via probability densities or via density matrices @xcite .",
    "it appears in the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "there is an alternative definition of the thermodynamic work @xcite @xmath8 it applies to the open - system situation , e.g. particles interacting with baths @xcite .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) leads to ( [ eq:00 ] ) due to the hamilton equations of motion .",
    "if @xmath7 is a coordinate of the source , the full time - independent hamiltonian of the system and source reads is not a coordinate , ( [ eq:00 ] , [ eq:43 ] ) stay consistent as far as the system and the work - source form a closed system . ]",

    "the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath12 of the system in ( [ eq:00 ] , [ eq:43 ] ) results from ( [ eq:740 ] ) , if the reaction of the system to the source is neglected , e.g. because the source is heavy .",
    "two important features of the thermodynamic work ( [ eq:00 ] ) are displayed via ( [ eq:43 ] , [ eq:740 ] ) .",
    "first , since the total energy ( [ eq:740 ] ) is conserved , the thermodynamic work ( [ eq:00 ] ) relates to the energy change @xmath11 of the source @xcite .",
    "second , ( [ eq:43 ] , [ eq:740 ] ) show that @xmath13 is the potential force acting ( from the particle ) to the source",
    ". then ( [ eq:43 ] ) relates to the mechanic concept of work : force times the displacement @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the thermodynamic work can not be read directly from ( [ eq:00 ] , [ eq:43 ] , [ eq:01 ] ) , because neither @xmath24 nor its time - difference stay invariant under a gauge - transformation defined via a function @xmath25 ) @xcite : @xmath26 the kinetic momentum @xmath17 in ( [ eq:01 ] ) is gauge - invariant . but",
    "@xmath27 is not @xcite . )",
    "this issue is resolved easily by choosing @xmath3 as e.g. the coordinate of a physical source of work @xcite ; see ( [ eq:740 ] ) and appendix [ uno ] . ]",
    "the same problem exists for a quantum particle interacting with emf @xcite .",
    "one response to the emf gauge - freedom problem is that the gauge in ( [ eq:01 ] ) is to be selected as ( temporal gauge ) @xcite : @xmath28 this definition is indirectly supported by the standard emf energy - momentum tensor , which suggests that particles do not have potential energy @xcite ; see appendix [ standard_standard ] .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) under @xmath29 implies that the sought thermodynamic work would amount to the particle s kinetic energy change , i.e. to the mechanic work done on the particle by the lorentz force @xcite",
    ". this can not be the correct definition of the thermodynamic work .",
    "first , because it implies that time - independent fields do thermodynamic work @xcite .. the temporal gauge is achieved by taking @xmath30 in ( [ eq:27 ] ) , which brings in a time - dependent @xmath31 and shows from ( [ eq:00 ] , [ eq:01 ] ) that the work done is not zero and equals to the change of the kinetic energy .",
    "the latter is non - zero , since _ only _",
    "@xmath32 is conserved in time @xcite . ]",
    "second , because this work ( [ eq:43 ] ) relates to the force acting on the source , and not to the force acting on the particle .",
    "another possibility for resolving the gauge - freedom is to employ in ( [ eq:01 ] ) the coulomb gauge @xcite : @xmath33 but the scalar potential @xmath34 in the gauge ( [ eq:60 ] ) propagates with infinite speed @xcite .",
    "reads @xcite : @xmath35 . upon using ( [ eq:60 ] )",
    "we get for time - dependent @xmath34 in the coulomb gauge the `` static '' equation @xmath36 implying that @xmath37 responds instantly to changes in the charge density @xmath38 @xcite ] while this is consistent with electric @xmath39 and magnetic @xmath40 fields propagating with speed @xmath41 @xcite , it also means that @xmath42|and the hamiltonian ( [ eq:01 ] ) defined via it|cannot be given a direct physical meaning .    for both proposals",
    "it is unclear how the work defined via ( [ eq:01 ] ) relates to the energy of the source ( heavy body ) .    noting the difficulties with the temporal and coulomb gauge , it is natural to look at the lorenz gauge , @xmath43 which is relavistic invariant and causal , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath44 defined from ( [ eq:13 ] ) propogate with speed @xmath41 @xcite . given ( [ eq:13 ] ) and standard boundary conditions of decaying at spatial infinity , @xmath45 is uniquely expressed via gauge - invariant electromagnetic field @xmath46 , and hence it is observable @xcite . if the photon is found to have a small ( but finite ) mass , ( [ eq:13 ] ) will hold automatically @xcite .",
    "these features are suggestive , but they do not suffice for defining the thermodynamic work .",
    "our results validate the usage of ( [ eq:01 ] , [ eq:13 ] ) , and also show that main features of the thermodynamic work generalize to the relativistic , electromagnetic situation :     the definition of the ( thermodynamic ) work based on ( [ eq:01 ] , [ eq:13 ] ) results from a separation of overall ( source + particle(s ) + emf ) energy into specific components .",
    "this separation is not arbitrary , but emerges from a relativistically covariant energy - momentum tensor @xmath47 for the overall system ; see section [ tensor ] . @xmath47",
    "necessarily differs from the standard energy - momentum tensor ( e.g. because @xmath47 has to account for a potential energy ) , but it leads to the same values of the overall energy .",
    "it consistently relates to an angular momentum ( tensor ) .",
    "certain aspects of @xmath47 are known from @xcite , but in its entirety it is proposed for the first time .    ",
    "the approach leads to a formulation of the first law for a relativistic thermally isolated situation , which we demonstrate for point charges with retarded electromagnetic interactions . according to this formulation",
    ", the thermodynamic work can be defined through the _ gauge - invariant _ kinetic energy of the source , but it is also equal to the change of ( [ eq:01 ] ) in the lorenz gauge . as compared to the non - relativistic first law|which",
    "is an automatic consequence of energy conservation @xcite [ cf .",
    "( [ eq:740])]|the formulation is necessarily approximate , since some energy is stored in the ( near ) emf , even if the radiated energy is negligible .",
    "once the thermodynamic work amounts to the kinetic energy of the source , it directly relates it to the mechanic work done by the lorentz force acting on the source .",
    "thus the two important features ( described after ( [ eq:740 ] ) ) generailze to the relativistic , electromagnetic situation .",
    "several recent studies looked at the work done by emf in the context of fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "but the problem of the emf gauge - freedom was not addressed , partially due to implicitly assumed magnetostatic limit , where the gauge ( [ eq:60 ] ) is employed by default , and where ( [ eq:13 ] ) and ( [ eq:60 ] ) are approximately equal @xcite .",

    "[ f5a ] shows that ( [ eq:52 ] ) holds , and the causality of the energy flow is well - visible : when the energy transfer starts ( at @xmath151 ) , @xmath152 first decreases , and then increases to a slightly smaller value : the transferred energy ( work ) first goes out of @xmath92|hence @xmath152 decreases|and then it arrives at @xmath92 .",
    "the small mismatch between those initial and final values is due to the energy that is radiated away .",
    "this energy is determined from the overall kinetic energy difference @xmath153 between initial and final times , because at those times the particles are ( asymptotically ) free . for parameters of fig .",
    "[ f5a ] the radiated energy is small .",
    "[ f5b ] presents a situation , where the velocities are sufficiently large and the radiation is essential .",
    "the main message of fig .",
    "[ f5b ] is that the processes of radiation and energy transfer are well - separated .",
    "this appears to be a general feature of 1d collisions under ( [ eq:57 ] ) .",
    "first the radiation is emitted from @xmath92 : @xmath154 decreases , while @xmath155 ; see fig .",
    "no work is done at those times and ( [ eq:52 ] ) does not hold . at somewhat later times ,",
    "@xmath154 and @xmath156 start to change so that ( [ eq:52 ] ) holds ; see fig .",
    "the work is exchanged causally : first the energy leaves @xmath92 and both @xmath154 and @xmath152 decrease .",
    "afterwards , @xmath157 and @xmath152 increase ; see fig .",
    "the validity of ( [ eq:520 ] , [ eq:52 ] ) is illustrated as @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 in fig .",
    "hence most of the work is exchanged in the time - interval @xmath161 $ ] .",
    "we started by arguing that the problem of defining and interpreting the thermodynamic work done on a charged particle by time - dependent electromagnetic field ( emf ) is still open .",
    "in particular , the definition of the thermodynamic work is not automatic , since the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ eq:01 ] ) of the particle is not gauge - invariant .",
    "hence deeper physical reasons are needed for coming up with a consistent definition of work .",
    "we stress that previous attempts @xcite did not resolve this problem .",
    "in particular , it was not clear how to formulate the first law ( that relates the work to the energy of the emf - source ) , and how to connect with the mechanic work ( force times displacement ) .",
    "all these issues are relevant for relativistic statistical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the solution of the problem was sought along the following lines :     the definition of work ought to emerge from a consistent energy - momentum tensor of the overall system ( particles+emf ) . in particular",
    ", this ensures that the definition is relativistically covariant .",
    "the standard energy - momentum tensor of emf does not apply to this problem , since it implies that the particle does not have a potential energy and hence indirectly supports the choice of the temporal gauge @xmath29 that leads to unacceptable conclusions for the definition of the thermodynamic work ; see section [ introduction ] .",
    " the definition should hold the first law ( work - energy theorem ) that relates the energy of the work - recipient with the energy of the work - source .",
    "we carried out this program|within lacunae listed below|and showed that the physically meaningful definition emerges from the lorenz gauge of emf .",
    "it comes from the energy - momentum tensor ( for matter+emf ) that is proposed in section [ tensor ]",
    ". this tensor is gauge - invariant and holds several necessary features .",
    "its differences and similarities with the standard energy - momentum tensor are discussed in section [ tensor ] and appendix [ standard_standard ] .",
    "the thermodynamic work can be defined via the particle s hamiltonian in the lorenz gauge . to an extent we were able to check ,",
    "it is only in this gauge that the thermodynamic work is relativistically consistent and relates to the gauge - invariant kinetic energy of the source of emf .",
    "the latter can also be recovered as the mechanic work done by lorentz force acting on the source , thereby establishing a relation between the thermodynamic and mechanic work .",
    "our motivation was and is to understand how to define work for particles interacting with / via a non - stationary emf .",
    "besides its obvious importance in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ,    several questions remain open .    first , whether the first law ( [ eq:52 ] ) can be verified analytically .",
    "the issue here is that delay - differential equations that govern relativistic dynamics are notoriously difficult to study analytically @xcite .",
    "the existing perturbative methods , which can employ ( [ eq:57 ] ) as a starting point , focus either on the weakly - coupled situation @xcite or on the long - time limit @xcite .",
    "both these limits are not especially interesting for verifying ( [ eq:52 ] ) .",
    "an analytical derivation can also clarify whether there are other gauges that hold the conservation law ( [ eq:52 ] ) with at least the same precision as the lorenz gauge does .",
    "second , we verified the first law ( [ eq:52 ] ) for retarded dynamics of two coupled charges either in the limit where the radiation reaction is negligible ( but the dynamics is still relativistic ) , or when the processes of work exchange and radiation are separated in time .",
    "( the latter is typical for 1d collisions ) .",
    "the proper generalization of ( [ eq:52 ] ) for a situation when the work exchange and radiation take place simultaneously is not clear yet .",
    "third , while the notion of work relates to the energy transfer , it should be interesting to study the momentum transfer along the above lines .",
    "fourth , our consideration is classical .",
    "we expect it to apply to the semiclassical situation , where a non - relativistic quantum system interacts with a classical emf .",
    "but the quantum relativistic situation is not clear ; in this context see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion of energy changes described by the dirac s equation .",
