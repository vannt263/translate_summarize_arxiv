    "when an ion hits a surface liberates locally a large amount of energy that melts a region of the solid immediately below . for geometrical reasons ,",
    "the sputtering effect depends on the surface - curvature : the energy concentrates on regions of positive curvature and this favorites the excavation of valleys and the growth of hills . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal diffusion and surface tension tend to smoothen the irregularities by flattening the surface .",
    "it has been observed that under the combined action of these mechanisms the surface tends to create spontaneously ripples @xcite . in nature , ripples are commonly observed in sandy - deserts as the result of dynamical instability of the sand surface under the action of a sufficiently strong wind @xcite . in this case , the formation of ripples is commonly associated with the effect produced by some grains that are lifted from the sand - bed and accelerated by the wind .",
    "these grains , when re - impact with the bed , splash up a number of other grains .",
    "most of these grains return to the bed leading to a local rearrangement , whereas some other are accelerated by the wind and impact again on the bed after a certain ` saltation ' length . in the literature , many studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanism of ripple formation @xcite . in particular , an hydrodynamical model for aeolian ripple formation , based on a continuum dynamical description with two species of grains ( immobile and rolling grains ) , was proposed with success by bouchaud et al . @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of such a model is a bilinear differential equation , for the population of the two species of grains , which shows the instability of a flat bed against ripple formation .",
    "ripples on sand ( gobi desert ) and ripples on surfaces ( ag under ion sputtering ) .",
    "the line is indicative of the different length scales involved : it represents 1 @xmath1 in the left picture and 50 @xmath2 in the right one .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in this paper we show that the same reasoning which has been used to describe the sand ripples formation in deserts , applied to the studies of dynamical surface roughening , leads to an accurate description of the morphogenesis and evolution of ripples on crystal and amorphous surfaces during ion sputtering .",
    "the present approach contains the bradley - harper approach @xcite and its nonlinear extension by rost et al .",
    "@xcite and by park et al .",
    "@xcite ( based on a kuramoto - sivashisky and kardar - parisi - zhang type equations @xcite ) and it is also able to describe some of the crucial experimental features observed in these systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , by means of this approach we can describe the two distinct dynamical behaviors experimentally observed in amorphous / semiconductors systems and in metals @xcite . in the first case ( amorphous / semiconductors )",
    "we find that the ripples growth exponentially fast at constant wavelength @xmath3 up to a critical roughening @xmath4 at which the growing process interrupts . on the other hand , in metals ( when the erlich - schwoebel barrier is active )",
    ", we can observe a transition between an initial exponential to a slower power - law growth of the roughness ( the root mean square of the height profile ) .",
    "in this regime the ripple - wavelength tends also to growth with time and re - nucleation effects are observed .",
    "finally , we show that the intriguing phenomena of `` ripple rotation '' @xcite , associated with a change in the sputtering incidence angle , can be conveniently described by means of the present approach .",
    "the main novelty of this work is the use of a new kind of equation to describe the surface instabilities under ion sputtering . in the present approach we clearly distinguish between three mechanisms : 1 ) erosion ; 2 ) adsorption - condensation ; 3 ) mobility .",
    "physically , all these three mechanisms take place simultaneously at a surface under ion - bombardment .",
    "the possibility to distinguishing between them clarifies the approach , simplifies the choice of the parameters and enlarges the descriptive power of the theory .",
    "moreover , we distinguish between atoms that stay in the bulk in bounded position and others that stay on the surface and are mobile .",
    "this ( simplified ) view is more realistic than considering the whole system as a fluid .",
    "we note that these novel elements of the present theory do not introduce -per se- extra parameters in the analogy with the well established bradley - harper theory @xcite .",
    "however , our choice in this paper has been to study the equations in their most complete form introducing therefore extra parameters .",
    "we show that , from the linear analysis , the bradley - harper solution for the ripple wavelength as well as other solutions for typical ripple periodicity in sandy deserts can be all retrieved and extended .",
    "when the surface of a solid is taken under ion sputtering some atoms in the proximity of the surface receive energy from the sputtered ions and pass from a bounded - _ ` immobile ' _ - solid state to a _ ` mobile ' _ melted state .",
    "the opposite mechanism is also allowed : some _ mobile _ atoms can gain in energy by becoming _",
    "immobile _ and bounding in a given position in the solid .",
    "a certain fraction of atoms might also be dispersed into the atmosphere .",
    "let us call @xmath5 the height of surface profile made of immobile -bounded- atoms and call @xmath6 the height of mobile -melted- atoms . in analogy with the theory developed to explain the dynamical evolutions of dunes in deserts @xcite , we describe the mechanisms of excavation , exchange between mobile and immobile atoms and surface displacement of mobile atoms in term of the following differential equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rate of atoms that are excavated under the action of the sputtering , and @xmath9 is the part of them that pass from immobile to mobile , whereas @xmath10 is the fraction that is dispersed into the atmosphere .",
    "let us now write in details the various terms contained in eq.[e1 ] .",
    "the excavation effect must clearly depend on the number and velocity of the sputtered ions ( i.e. its flux ) , but also the local shape and orientation of the surface might play an important role .",
    "indeed , the energy transmitted by the impacting ions concentrate more in regions of the surface with positive curvature .",
    "moreover , part of the surface facing the flux are likely to experience a different erosion respect to others which are less exposed to the flux .",
    "such dependence of the sputtering yields from the combination of the surface curvature and the incoming ion flux orientation has been described in great details in the literature ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here we adopt the same reasoning that lead to the bradley and harper equation @xcite . crystalline orientation and anisotropies",
    "might be also taken into account .",
    "we can write : @xmath11 here",
    "@xmath12 is the sputtering flux ; @xmath13 is a vectorial parameter associated with the flux - direction - dependent erosion and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are associated with the curvature - dependent sputtering erosion .",
    "all these term are implicitly dependent on the orientation of the incoming ion flux , this in analogy with @xcite .",
    "a noise term @xmath16 can be eventually added to eq.[gex ] .",
    "this term might mimic the fact that the incoming flux is made -after all- of discrete particles and that in experiments certain amounts of noise and randomness are unavoidable .",
    "the rate of adsorption of mobile atoms into immobile solid positions must be dependent on the quantity of mobile atoms in a given spatial position .",
    "similarly to the excavation process , the adsorption is also dependent on the local curvature and orientation .",
    "we can write : @xmath17 where the parameter @xmath18 is the recombination rate and @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are associated to the different probabilities of recombination in relation with the local orientation and shape of the surface .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "[ gex ] , [ gad ] contain the same terms @xcite as the ones proposed in the literature for the formation of aeolian dunes in the so - called hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "indeed , in deserts , sand grains are lifted from the sand - bed and readsorbed into it with a probability which is dependent on the local shape and orientation of the dunes .",
    "[ gex ] , [ gad ] represent the simplest analytical expressions which formally take into account these shape and orientation dependences . in the quest for simple explanations ,",
    "such equations are therefore rather universal .",
    "mobile atoms will move on the surface , and the quantity @xmath22 in eq.[e1 ] is the ` current ' of these atoms . in surface growth ,",
    "there are two main mechanisms that are commonly indicated as responsible for the surface mobility of atoms @xcite .",
    "the first is a current , driven by the variations of the local chemical potential , which tends to smoothen the surface asperity moving atoms from hills to valleys .",
    "the second is a current induced by the erlich - schwoebel barrier which -on the contrary- moves atoms uphill . in addiction to these main mechanisms we might also have to take into account a drift velocity and a random thermal diffusion , obtaining : @xmath23 in this equation , the first term describes a deterministic diffusion driven by the variations of the chemical potential which depends on the local shape of the surface ; the second term is associated with the uphill current due to the erlich - schwoebel barrier and @xmath24 is a constant associated with the characteristic length .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is a drift velocity of the mobile atoms on the surface , whereas @xmath26 is the dispersion constant associated with the random thermal motion .",
    "( the coefficient @xmath26 is related with a non - deterministic diffusion mechanism and it could mimic the evaporation - condensation effects . )    note that eq.[j1 ] is substantially different from the one proposed in the literature to describe ripples in granular media @xcite . here",
    "the current is supposed to be dependent on the local shape and orientation of the surface ( the @xmath27 profile ) .",
    "the equations describing sandy deserts can be retrieved from eq.[j1 ] by imposing @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but -on the contrary- in surface growth these two parameters are the leading terms of the equation and play the role of control parameters in the dynamics of ripple formation .",
    "nonetheless , these terms describe a rather simple dependence of the dynamic of particles on a surface on the geometrical shape of the surface itself . again",
    ", in our seek for universality , we expect that similar terms can be profitably introduced in the context of aeolian sand ripples in order to describe specific phenomena ( associated , for instance , with packing properties @xcite or granular flow @xcite ) which relate the current of grains with the dune - shapes .",
    "it should be noted that the factors @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eqs.[gex],[gad ] and [ j1 ] are _ vectors _",
    "( i.e. they have two distinct components in the @xmath0 directions ) .",
    "indeed , off - normal sputtering introduce anisotropy , and crystal surfaces are in general anisotropic",
    ". therefore one must take into account the dependence of the parameters on the relative orientation of both the crystal - surface and the sputtering direction .",
    "in eq.[j1 ] the deterministic diffusion parameter @xmath33 is assumed isotropic . on the other hand , on crystalline surfaces anisotropies",
    "are expected and sometimes might play an important role @xcite .",
    "the extension of the results presented in this paper to the case of anisotropic @xmath33 is straightforward .",
    "numerical solutions of eq.[e1 ] at various times @xcite indicate that under the action of ion sputtering the surface develops an instability which leads to the formation of ripples with a well defined characteristic wavelength . in the figure",
    "the black - tick line is the final surface - profile , whereas the thinner gray lines ( green online ) are some profiles at previous times .",

    "see appendix [ a.sim ] for details.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "a trivial solution of eq.[e1 ] can be written for a completely flat surface : @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this case , we obtain @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this describes a surface that rests flat and it is eroded with a speed equal to @xmath38 . but this behavior is only hypothetical since -in general- the dynamics of the surface - profile presents instabilities against spontaneous roughening and therefore its evolution is more complex .",
    "for instance , numerical solutions of eq.[e1 ] , are shown in fig.[f.1 ] ( for the 1-dimensional case ) and in figs.[f.2d ] , [ f.rotation ] , [ f.shape ] ( for the two - dimensional case ) .",
    "we observe that , in a certain range of the parameters , the surface is unstable and periodic ripples or other instabilities are formed spontaneously .      in order to infer indications about the amplification or the smoothing of small perturbations and to deduce an analytical expression for the ripples wave - length at their beginning , we performe a stability analysis on eq.[e1 ] .",
    "for this purpose we assume that the surface - profile is made by the combination of a flat term plus a rough part : @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
