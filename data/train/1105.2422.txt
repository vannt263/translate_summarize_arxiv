    "coding has shown its power for disseminating information over networks @xcite . for wireless cooperative networks ,",
    "there are increased interests in employing the idea of network coding for improving the throughput of the network .",
    "indeed , the gain is very impressive for the special bi - directional relaying scenarios with two - way or multi - way traffic as addressed in @xcite .",
    "the denoise - and - forward protocol has shows its excellence for the problem of two transmitters wishing to exchange information through a relay in the middle .",
    "although there are various works addressing the denoise - and - forward protocal @xcite , it is still a hot topic for how to implement it in practice when the channel coding is involved . in @xcite ,",
    "joint network and channel coding was proposed for the simple real additive multiple - access white gaussian noise channel . by noticing the linearity of both network and channel coding ,",
    "the soft log - likelihood ratios ( llrs ) for the network - coded codeword can be directly estimated from the received physically - superimposed signals .    in this paper , we provide further insights into the joint network and ldpc coding approach for bi - directional relaying with bpsk signaling . in particular , the complex multiple - access channel is considered and a closed - form expression is derived for the llrs of network - coded codeword .",
    "it is also revealed that the equivalent channel observed at the relay is an asymmetrical channel .",
    "for bi - directional relaying , we assume that communication takes place in two phases - a multiple access ( mac ) phase and a broadcast phase .      during the mac phase , the source nodes a and b transmit the modulated signals @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the relay . under a real multiple - access white gaussian noise channel",
    ", the received signal at the relay for the @xmath2th time epoch can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance of @xmath5 .    for coded transmission ,",
    "it is of interest to consider a block of transmission . in this paper ,",
    "the block coded bpsk transmission is assumed and the same codeword length @xmath6 is assumed for both nodes a and b. at both source nodes , the information bits are first input to the block encoder and the encoder output the encoded vector @xmath7 for node a and @xmath8 for node b. the encoded vector is further mapped to @xmath9 by @xmath10 before transmission for both nodes a and b. at the relay node , we get the received vector @xmath11 , which can be formulated as @xmath12      the denoise - and - forward approach is first proposed in @xcite . for this approach ,",
    "the relay employs a denoising function based on an adaptive network coding to map the received signal vector into a quantized signal vector @xmath13 for the broadcast phase . in theory , this is rather involved and the joint maximum likelihood sequence estimation ( mlse ) is often employed .",
    "in essence , the joint mlse tries to find @xmath14 it is clear that the triple @xmath15 is jointly typical @xcite .",
    "then , the relay often employs a network coding function for denoising from @xmath16 to @xmath13 : @xmath17 often , the simple xor function is enough , namely , @xmath18 .    during the broadcast phase , the relay transmits the signal vector @xmath13 to both nodes a and b. hence , nodes a and b can retrieve their own information as they know completely what they have sent .    in practice , the joint mlse is often infeasible due to the complexity issue .",
    "hence , one often simply considers the un - coded case @xcite , which , however , is far away from the optimality .",
    "in this paper , we restrict the block coding scheme on ldpc coding for both nodes a and b. let @xmath19 be a @xmath20 ldpc code of block length @xmath6 and dimension @xmath21 for node a , which has a parity - check matrix @xmath22 $ ] of @xmath23 rows , and @xmath6 columns .",
    "let @xmath24 denote its code rate .",
    "correspondingly , we can define the code @xmath25 with a parity - check matrix of @xmath26 for node b.    for any given ldpc encoded vector @xmath7 for node a and @xmath8 for node b , we have @xmath27      for the single - user approach , we mean that the relay node decodes the ldpc code @xmath19 ( or @xmath25 ) from the received mac signal by viewing the signal from node b ( or node a ) as the pure interference and then the xor codeword based on the decoded codewords @xmath28 and @xmath29 is formulated for broadcasting . to initiate the iterative decoding ,",
    "it is of importance to compute the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) at any time epoch @xmath2 from the received signal @xmath30 ( for brevity we omit the time epoch in what follows ) @xmath31    then , it is straightforward to show that @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    as shown in ( [ eq:9 ] ) ,",
    "there is no difference in computing the llr output for nodes a and b. hence , one can deduce that the single - user approach simply fails to work .      for joint network and ldpc coding ,",
    "we consider the employment of the same ldpc code at both nodes a and b. in this case , one have that @xmath35 and @xmath36 then , the relay tries to decode @xmath37 directly . during the broadcast phase",
    ", the relay node transmits the xor codeword @xmath38 to both nodes a and b. then , nodes a and b decode @xmath37 based on the received signal vector and since they have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , they can obtain @xmath40 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "hence , the bottleneck is to decode @xmath38 for the relay node during the mac phase .    for the real mac channel ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    ", we show , however , this difficulty can be solved smoothly .",
    "indeed , the mac channel ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be equivalently viewed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 by abuse of notation .",
    "this equivalent channel is memoryless and is specified by the conditional probability density function @xmath43 this means that the equivalent mac channel is typically an asymmetrical memoryless channel .    assuming that the receiver has knowledge of the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "then , if the optimal log - likelihood detection is employed , the soft llr output provided by the channel is given by @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by noting ( [ eq:12 ] ) , it follows that @xmath45    once the soft llrs referred to the xor codeword @xmath38 are computed , the relay then implements the standard iterative decoding over the tanner - graph of @xmath46 for getting an estimate of @xmath38 .",
    "in practice , the real mac channel model ( [ eq:1 ] ) is too ideal .",
    "hence , one often have to consider the following complex mac channel @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are complex variables and @xmath50 is the zero - mean complex additive gaussian noise with variance of @xmath51 .",
    "if the channel is kept fixed during the transmission of a codeword , one can collect the signals to form a vector @xmath52 just as we encountered in ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath53 be a discrete complex signal set , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . with the same idea developed in section - iii , one can show that an equivalent channel model for the xor codeword @xmath37 takes the form of @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "this equivalent channel is memoryless and is specified by the conditional probability density function @xmath58 this means that the equivalent mac channel is typically an asymmetrical memoryless channel .",
    "the llr output can be calculated as @xmath59}{\\sigma^2}\\right ) - \\text{logcosh}\\left(\\frac{\\re[\\tilde{y}_r \\xi_0^*]}{\\sigma^2}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\       & & - \\frac{|\\xi_1|^2-|\\xi_0|^2}{2\\sigma^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the normalized equal - power case , namely , @xmath60 , this complex mac channel is often characterized by the carrier - offset @xmath61 .",
    "as the bottleneck of the bi - directional relaying system lies in the processing capability of the relay node and its performance . for the proposed joint network and ldpc coding scheme , it is the duty of the relay to reproduce the xor codeword @xmath37 .",
    "hence , we mainly focus on the performance of the xor codeword @xmath38 .",
    "the performance is closely related to the energy per bit and the received noise variance . for a simple comparison with the standard bpsk modulated awgn channel , we still assume that @xmath62 for the real mac channel model of ( [ eq:1 ] ) , where @xmath63 denotes the energy per bit for node a ( or b ) .",
    "this is possible as we assume that both nodes a and b employ the same ldpc code with @xmath64 and the energy per bit for both nodes a and b keeps the same .",
    "the considered code is a ( 3,6)-regular ldpc code with codewords of length @xmath65 , which is constructed by a progressive - edge - growth algorithm reported in @xcite .",
    "a maximum number of demodulation iterations is @xmath66 . for decoding of ldpc codes ,",
    "the normalized min - sum algorithm ( nmsa)@xcite is assumed , which can speed the simulations with little degradation on the final performance . the scaling factor for the nmsa decoding is set to @xmath67 .    the ber performance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the real mac channel . also included is the normalized equal - power complex mac channel with @xmath68 .",
    "as shown , the joint network and ldpc coding approach performs well while the single - user approach simple fails to work as predicted previously .",
    "we have presented a joint network and ldpc coding scheme for bi - directional relaying .",
    "it is found that the multiple - access channel at the relay node can be viewed as an equivalent asymmetrical channel where the channel input codeword is the xor codeword between nodes a and b. in simulations , we employ a ( 3,6)-regular ldpc code , which is far from the optimality for the equivalent asymmetrical channel .",
    "hence , it is of interest to consider the design of ldpc codes for the asymmetrical mac channel by employing the idea of @xcite .",
