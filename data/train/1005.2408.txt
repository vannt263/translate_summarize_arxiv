    "much of the differences between the various sfr - m _ * @xmath1  relations can be attributed to the selective inclusion of extremely low - sfr galaxies in the samples under study .",
    "there is mounting evidence that many , perhaps most agn hosts are actively forming stars .",
    "this relates to the issue of whether such hosts are `` blue '' , `` red '' , or `` green valley '' sources ( e.g. , brammer et al .  2009 and references therein ) .",
    "this is especially important at high redshift due to the known tendency for the fraction of blue galaxies to increase with redshift ( e.g. e07 and references therein ) .",
    "works like salim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that low - z agn hosts populate the more massive part of the sf sequence .",

    "this correlation is hinted at in various intermediate and high redshift studies ( netzer et al .  2007 ; lutz et al .",

    "these are x - ray selected sources where l_bol @xmath3  is estimated from @xmath31 and the sfr is based on multi - wavelength sed fitting .",
    "the two groups lie on the above relationship with a scatter in sfr of about 0.4 dex , comparable to the overall scatter .",
    "there are several reasons for this scatter . at the low - l_bol @xmath3",
    "end , the scatter is related to the inaccuracies in sfr and l_bol @xmath3  determination as well as real scatter in these properties . at z@xmath41 and z@xmath42 ,",
    "the scatter reflects the uncertainty in sed modelling and the range of m _ * @xmath1  across the sf sequence . at the high - l_bol @xmath3  end ,",
    "much of the scatter is due to observational uncertainties , the incompleteness of the high redshift agn samples and , perhaps , the extreme sfr in mergers . a more complete account of these issues can be found in n09 .",
    "the following analysis relies on the combination of the above correlations for sf agn hosts .",
    "given l_bol @xmath3 , we can determine sfr ( eq .  [ eq : lbol_sfr ] ) and this , in turn , can be translated to m _ * @xmath1  given the redshift dependent sfr - m _ * @xmath1  correlations .",
    "to explore m_*/m_bh @xmath0 , we define several samples of both agn and non - agn galaxies .",

    "( 2002 ) , we choose only red galaxies , following the colour cut of baldry et al .",
    "the number of such sources , after applying some basic quality criteria , is 210,158 .",
    "they cover the range @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the latter lower limit was chosen to filter out dubious measurements ) . m _ * @xmath1  is derived from the sdss photometry and thus the flux limit of the sample ( @xmath34 ) affects the number of low - m _ * @xmath1  galaxies . here",
    "we deal mostly with the larger m _ * @xmath1   systems and these limitations do not affect our general conclusions .",
    "the work involves also four agn samples : type - i and type - ii samples at 0.1@xmath5z@xmath50.2 , a type - i sample at z@xmath41 and a type - i sample at z@xmath42 .",
    "the first two provide little new information but serve to test and to justify the general new method presented here .",
    "the 0.1@xmath5z@xmath50.2 redshift range is chosen to enable proper measurements of type - i and type - ii agn ( see details in n09 ) .",

    ", this translates to @xmath38 .",
    "we constructed the sf sequence for our type - ii low redshift sample and compared it with the sf sequence presented in b04 .",
    "the agreement is very good , with about 70% of the agn hosts lying on the sequence .",
    "we also confirm earlier results",
    "( e.g. salim et al .  2007 ) which suggest that agn hosts concentrate at somewhat higher m _ * @xmath1 .",
    "we find that despite their apparently red colours , the majority of the red s2 hosts are actively forming stars and are situated on the sf sequence .",
    "these sf s2 hosts are , in fact , mostly green valley sources , with lower ssfr .",
    "some 30% of the agn are not part of the sf sequence .",
    "we suspect that the fraction of such sources at higher redshift is smaller but have no way to check it qualitatively .",
    "the remaining of the paper and the results concerning m_*/m_bh @xmath0  refer _ only _ to those agn that are on the sf sequence .",

    "[ eq : lbol_sfr ] .",
    "the distribution of inferred sfrs ( not shown here ) clearly shows that these agn hosts are actively forming stars at rates that are comparable to the non - agn sfgs at those redshifts .",
    "in particular , 99% of the z@xmath42 sources have sfr@xmath41 , the median sfr in the sf sequence of d07 .    while most ( not all , see earlier comments )",
    "high redshift agn hosts are expected to lie on the sf sequence , the range in sfr and in m _ * @xmath1  can be very different from those found for non - agn samples because of the differences in properties of the observed samples , in particular different flux limits . to examine this in detail , we focus on our z@xmath42 type - i agn sample .",
    "we compare the range of derived sfr and possible range of m _ * @xmath1  to the same properties in the d07 sample , using data kindly provided by emanuele daddi .",
    "such a comparison involves two crucial factors .",

    "as explained above , almost all our type - i agn occupy only the upper part of the z@xmath42 sf sequence .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the sdss flux limit .",
    "second , one can consider two approaches to deduce typical values of m _ * @xmath1  for the z@xmath41 and z@xmath42  samples , by either ( 1 ) converting each individual sfr to m _ * @xmath1  through the best fit sf sequence , at the appropriate redshift ( i.e. e07 and d07 ) , or ( 2 ) sampling the distribution of m _ * @xmath1  per given sfr ( in the high - redshift sf sequences ) , for each deduced value of sfr . by definition",
    ", the latter will result in a considerably broader distribution of the derived m_*/m_bh @xmath0 , due to the wide range of properties in the observed samples . in the following analysis we only use the first approach ,",

    "standard galaxy evolution scenarios suggest that the end phase of many high redshift sf galaxies are massive , red ellipticals",

    "accounting for younger stellar populations would result in lower m _ * @xmath1  and thus lower m_*/m_bh @xmath0  ( see d10 and peng et al .",
    "2 .   the d10 sample represents the _ minority _ of the agn population , as hinted by two biases .",
    "first , the majority of the d10 sources lie in the top 15% of the m_bh @xmath2  distributions corresponding to their redshift .",

    "[ fig : mm_vs_mbh_all ] beyond @xmath54 .",
    "these numbers represent the requirement for the galaxies to _ over_-grow their smbhs by the above factors .",
    "this seems to be consistent with models which suggest that the high mass smbhs observed at z@xmath55 could have accumulated most of their mass by that redshift ( marconi et al .  2004 ) . on the other hand , it may be in contradiction with at least some scenarios linking agn activity to the shut - down of sf in their host galaxies ( see somerville et al .",

    "however , theoretical and observational arguments ( e.g. lotz et al .  2008 ; genel et al .",
    "2009 ) suggest a low rate of such events for z@xmath56 galaxies .",

    "the m_*/m_bh @xmath0  distributions presented here suggest an increase in m_*/m_bh @xmath0  by factors beyond what is suggested in many theoretical studies .",
    "finally , we comment on the possibility that the suggested evolution of m_*/m_bh @xmath0   could be due to two wrong assumptions .",
    "first , many more agn hosts may not lie on the sf sequence or may not obey the l_bol @xmath3-sfr correlation used here .",
    "this is unlikely to be the case at low redshift , where sdss type - ii agns are used .",
    "however , the selection of at least some of the most luminous , high redshift high - l_bol @xmath3  sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbol_lsf ] may be biased towards high fir luminosity , high sfr agn hosts ( e.g. zheng et al .",

    "_ herschel _ observations of well - defined agn samples are likely to resolve this issue .",
    "second , the drory & alvarez ( 2008 ) work shows a decline in sfr at the high - m _ * @xmath1  end for z@xmath52 galaxies .",
    "thus , some of our l_bol @xmath3-based sfr estimates might be associated with considerably larger values of m _ * @xmath1 .",
    "the e07 and d07 sf sequences do not show such a decline .",
    "we conclude that there is a steep evolution in m_*/m_bh @xmath0  from z@xmath55 to z=0 for sf agn hosts .",
    "this trend is barely consistent with some , but not all galaxy and bh evolution models .",
    "we have also demonstrated the crucial importance of considering different m_bh @xmath2  groups separately when evaluating the m_*/m_bh @xmath0  evolution .",
