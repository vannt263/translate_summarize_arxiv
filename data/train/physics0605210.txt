    "a common exercise in introductory physics courses concerns the comparison between the magnetic fields due to two loops of equal length @xmath0 , carrying the same current @xmath1 , one shaped into a square and the other shaped into a circle .",
    "one is asked to compare the magnetic fields at the centers of the respective figures @xcite , finding that the field at the center of the square is larger than the field at the center of the circle . in our classes ,",
    "this problem is always followed by a lively debate .",
    "many students feel that the opposite should occur , citing the fact that , for a given perimeter @xmath0 , the circle is the figure with the largest area .",
    "it is only when the two figures are drawn to scale , as in figure  [ figure1 ] ,    square and circle of equal perimeter @xmath0 .",
    ", height=132 ]    that they understand the result .",
    "the point is that , for equal perimeter , the sides of the square lie inside the circle for most of the integration paths .",
    "the result can be easily generalized for any polygon with @xmath2 equal sides and total perimeter @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] , illustrates the case of @xmath3 .",
    "pentagon with perimeter @xmath0 .",
    "( a ) pictorial representation of the vectors used in the calculation of @xmath4 , which are defined in the text . ( b )",
    "the line integral of @xmath4 is taken along the inner ( dotted ) polygonal curve @xmath5 . , height=245 ]    each side has length @xmath6 , placed at a distance @xmath7 from the center , where @xmath8 .",
    "the total magnetic field is simply equal to @xmath2 times the field produced by a straight wire of length @xmath9 carrying a current @xmath1 , at a point placed at a distance @xmath10 from the wire , along its perpendicular bisector : @xmath11 substituting for @xmath12 in equation  ( [ bncenter ] ) , we conclude that , for equal perimeter , the field at the center of a current - carrying triangle is the largest ; and the fields at the center of other current - carrying polygons with equal perimeter decrease as the number of sides increases , approaching the asymptotic value of @xmath13 obtained for the circle .",
    "this calculation can be assigned as a homework exercise .",
    "although the area does not play a role in this example , our students usually point out that it should play a role in determining the auto - flux through the wire loops . for a given perimeter @xmath0 , the areas enclosed by the polygon wires are @xmath14 , approaching the area of the circle , @xmath15 , as the number of sides increases .",
    "the naive multiplication @xmath16 grows with @xmath2 . normalizing this type of `` flux '' by @xmath17 , as we shall henceforth do in units of @xmath18 , i.e. , whenever we mention @xmath19 on the vertical axis , we are really plotting @xmath20 . ] , we find @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the circle , respectively .",
    "this seems to indicate that the smaller field at the center of the circle is more than compensated by its larger area .",
    "some students interpret this as a vindication of their initial intuition .",
    "unfortunately , things are considerably more complicated than this simple argument suggests , making it interesting to revisit this problem in an advanced course on electromagnetism .",
    "firstly , the magnetic field varies from point to point in space .",
    "the calculations of these magnetic fields may be found elsewhere for the polygon @xcite , for the circular loop @xcite , and for planar wires @xcite .",
    "secondly , these fields diverge at the position of the wires , meaning that some regularization must be used .",
    "thirdly , obtaining the flux directly from the magnetic fields requires a two dimensional integration , which becomes particularly difficult in the case of polygons .    in this article , we start by calculating the vector potential @xmath4 produced by a circular or polygonal loop of perimeter @xmath0 and carrying a current @xmath1 , at any point in the plane of the figure , inside the figure .",
    "naturally , @xmath4 and @xmath28 diverge as one approaches the wire loop .",
    "so , we will consider the flux of @xmath29 through a surface @xmath30 with edges on a curve @xmath31 similar to ( and concentric with ) the current loop , but scaled down by some amount ( _ c.f .",
    "_ figure  [ figure2](b ) ) . obtaining the flux directly from @xmath29 will require a further two - dimensional integration ( besides the one needed to obtain @xmath29 ) , which , moreover , is rather cumbersome in the case of polygonal surfaces .",
    "fortunately , we may use stokes theorem @xmath32 to turn the two - dimensional integration involving @xmath29 into the one - dimensional integration involving @xmath4 .",
    "many textbooks only mention the vector potential briefly ; this problem provides a striking example of how useful the vector potential may be in practical applications .",
    "the results we obtain also provide the mutual inductance of two nested , coplanar , and concentric ( polygonal or circular ) wires of equal shape but different scales .",
    "this can be used for theoretical discussions and experimental studies of faraday s law .",
    "we wish to calculate @xmath33 at a point p with coordinates @xmath34 , as illustrated in figure  [ figure2](a ) .",
    "we start by parametrizing the positions of the points on the right - hand side of the polygon as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . using @xmath37",
    ", we find @xmath38 & = & \\ln { \\left\\ { \\frac{- y + s_n/2 + \\sqrt{\\left[x - d_n\\right]^2+\\left[y - s_n/2\\right]^2 } } { - y - s_n/2 + \\sqrt{\\left[x - d_n\\right]^2+\\left[y+s_n/2\\right]^2 } } \\right\\ } } \\ \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_y\\ . \\label{an1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the position of the points along the @xmath39-th side ( moving anti - clockwise ) is simply given by a rotation of @xmath40 by an angle @xmath41 .",

    "we could now recover their equation ( 9 ) with @xmath48 by taking @xmath28 and suitable variable redefinitions only for the plane @xmath48 , we can not perform the derivations with respect to @xmath49 . however , these do not enter the calculation of @xmath50 which , by symmetry , is the only non - vanishing component of @xmath51 when @xmath48 . ] .",
    "as for the circular loop , we use polar coordinates . by symmetry , @xmath52 and we take @xmath53 . parametrizing the positions of the points along the current - carrying circular wire of radius @xmath54 as @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and we find @xmath58 \\fl & = & \\frac{2}{\\rho(\\rho+r ) } \\left [ ( \\rho^2+r^2)\\ , k\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\rho r}}{\\rho+r}\\right ) -(\\rho+r)^2\\ , e\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\rho r}}{\\rho+r}\\right ) \\right]\\ , \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_y\\ , \\label{ac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 we have checked that the function @xmath60 in equation  ( [ antotal ] ) tends to @xmath61 in equation  ( [ ac ] ) , as @xmath2 approaches infinity .",
    "also , by taking @xmath28 and suitable variable redefinitions , we recover the corresponding magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we recall two points mentioned in the introduction . because the fields diverge at the position of the wires",
    ", we will take the flux in a curve similar to the original wire but scaled down by some amount , as in figure  [ figure2](b ) .",
    "we may think of this as a cutoff introduced by the finite width of the wire , or as the situation faced in calculating the flux through a second loop , similar to ( but smaller than ) the current - carrying one . also , because the direct calculation of the flux of @xmath29 involves a two - dimensional integration , we will use equation  ( [ anotb ] ) and calculate instead the line integral of @xmath4 .",
    "the simplicity gained in utilizing @xmath4 is particularly striking in the case of the circular current loop , since equation  ( [ ac_not_theta ] ) means that @xmath4 is independent of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , choosing an integration circle @xmath63 of radius @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 & = & \\frac{4 \\pi}{\\rho+r } \\left [ ( \\rho^2+r^2)\\ , k\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\rho r}}{\\rho+r}\\right ) -(\\rho+r)^2\\ , e\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\rho r}}{\\rho+r}\\right ) \\right ] , \\label{phic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in going to the second line , we have made @xmath66 and @xmath54 dimensionless by scaling them by the perimeter @xmath0 and @xmath67 , and then dropped the primes . ] .",
    "it is instructive to compare the trivial reasoning on the first line of equation  ( [ phic ] ) with what would be needed to calculate the flux directly from the @xmath66-dependent @xmath68 .",
    "next we consider the magnetic field produced by a polygon with perimeter @xmath0 , @xmath2 equal sides , and carrying the current @xmath1 .",
    "the distance from the center to each of the sides is given by @xmath10 .",
    "consider also a second @xmath2-sided polygon @xmath5 whose sides lie a distance @xmath69 from the same center .",
    "the flux through this polygon is given by @xmath70 looking back at equation  ( [ ank ] ) one notices the need for integrals involving the logarithm of rather complicated functions .",
    "things can be greatly simplified , however .",
    "we start by rescaling all distances by the perimeter @xmath0 , thus rendering the variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 appearing in equation  ( [ ank ] ) dimensionless , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , and then dropped the primes . ] .",
    "next we introduce new parameters @xmath76 and new variables @xmath77 through @xmath78 for use in equations  ( [ ank ] ) and ( [ a_nk ] ) .",

    "first , expanding around @xmath83 , we find that the fluxes tend to the product of the magnetic field at the center with the area of a small central region whose distance to the sides is @xmath84 . indeed , @xmath85 here and henceforth ( including in all figures ) , we normalize the fluxes by @xmath18 , the magnetic fields by @xmath86 , and we continue to scale all distances by @xmath0 .",
    "naturally , we can recover equation  ( [ limit1 - 1 ] ) from equation  ( [ limit1 - 2 ] ) in the limit of @xmath2 going to infinity .",
    "second , @xmath87 tends to @xmath88 as @xmath2 goes to infinity , for all values of @xmath84 .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ figure3 ] , which displays @xmath87 for @xmath25 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath88 as a function of @xmath84 .",

    ", height=264 ]    each flux @xmath87 diverges at @xmath91 , while @xmath88 diverges at @xmath92 , providing a nontrivial crosscheck on our expressions .",
    "notice that , for each value of @xmath93 , the curve for @xmath88 lies below all other fluxes .",
    "although the fields @xmath29 vary as one moves away from the center , a very rough way of understanding this result is the following : the field at the center @xmath94 decreases as @xmath2 increases_c.f .",
    "_ equation  ( [ bncenter ] ) ; on the other hand , for fixed @xmath84 , the areas through which the flux is being considered are given by @xmath95 , for @xmath87 , and by @xmath96 , for @xmath88 , which also decrease as @xmath2 increases . therefore , in this case the `` area factors '' do not compensate for the smaller fields , as seen in equations  ( [ limit1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ limit1 - 2 ] ) .    since the fluxes diverge for @xmath97 , we may choose to consider another situation .",
    "we take all wires to be of a fixed width @xmath98 ( in units of @xmath0 ) , and we regularize the fluxes by integrating only up to @xmath99 , for the circle , and @xmath100 , for the polygons .",

    "auto - fluxes as a function of the width of the wire , for current - carrying polygons with @xmath25 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and for the circular loop .",
    ", height=264 ]    we notice the following features : i ) for any finite value of @xmath98 , the auto - flux increases as @xmath2 increases  this indicates that , here , the `` area factor '' is making up for the smaller value of the magnetic field at the center ; ii ) again , the curves of @xmath87 tend to @xmath88 as @xmath2 increases ; iii ) the flux diverges as the width of the wires tends to zero , as expected .    comparing figure  [ figure3 ] and",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] we notice that @xmath19 decreases with @xmath2 in the first case , while it increases with @xmath2 in the second .",
    "so , in contrast to the previous case , here the `` area factor '' compensates for the smaller fields .",
    "we can get a rough understanding for this in the following way : for fixed @xmath98 , the areas through which the flux is being considered are given by @xmath101 for @xmath87 , and by @xmath102 for @xmath88 , in units of @xmath103 . as @xmath98 vanishes ,",
    "the areas in equations  ( [ limit2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ limit2 - 2 ] ) are dominated by their first terms , which do increase enough as to offset the order of the field magnitudes .",
    "of course , this is a very crude argument , since , because the fields vary in different ways as one moves away from the center , using @xmath94 in the reasoning is a considerable source of error .",
    "nevertheless , this rough argument is consistent with figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "one can show that , although the curve of @xmath88 lies above those of @xmath87 for @xmath104 , the ratios @xmath105 tend to one as @xmath98 approaches zero",
    ". this might be difficult to guess initially , since it seems to contradict the `` area factor '' , but it has an interesting interpretation in terms of the line integral of @xmath4 .",
    "for points very close to the wires , the field approaches that of an infinite wire and @xmath4 diverges logarithmically .",
    "consequently , we may interpret the result of the line integral as the product of a logarithmic divergence with the perimeter @xmath0 over which the integral is taken . since these features are common to all the current - carrying loops , all ratios approach unity .",
    "of course , the same would not be the case if we had taken current - carrying loops of different perimeter ( recall that we have normalized all fluxes by @xmath18 ) .",
    "we can choose other regularizations besides the ones discussed above ( constant @xmath84 and constant @xmath98 ) . for instance , we may ask that the surfaces through which the flux is being considered have the same area . in this case , as in the case of fixed @xmath84 , @xmath87 decreases as @xmath2 increases . in contrast , if we ask that the surfaces through which the flux is being considered have the same perimeter , then @xmath87 increases as @xmath2 increases , as in the case of fixed @xmath98 .",
    "one can get a rough understanding for these features along the lines of the analysis made above .    finally , we recall that the line integrals of @xmath4 have been performed over curves @xmath5 and @xmath106 identical to the current - carrying wires , but smaller .",
    "this is what one needs for the calculation of the mutual inductance between two ( polygonal or circular ) current - carrying wires of equal shape and different scales that lie on the same plane and are concentric .",
    "our results apply directly to that case .",
    "motivated by a simple exercise in elementary electromagnetism , we have studied the interplay between the magnetic fields and the areas of current - carrying polygonal and circular wires of equal perimeter .",
    "we have calculated the vector potential @xmath4 for these situations , because its line integral provides a much simpler way of computing the magnetic fluxes ; this example illustrates the usefulness of @xmath4 in practical calculations . since the corresponding auto - fluxes diverge , we have discussed a number of regularizations , comparing the fluxes in each case , and seeking intuitive arguments for the results . as a bonus",
    ", our results can be applied directly to the calculation of mutual inductances in a variety of situations .",
