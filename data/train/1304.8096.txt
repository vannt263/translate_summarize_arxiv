    "<S> correlations decay as @xmath154 as long as @xmath155 which crosses over to an exponential decay for larger distances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath156 is the initial thermal correlation length .    to estimate the initial temperature of the dsp we observe that any polariton component with frequency larger than the off - resonant eit line - width @xmath157 will escape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a reasonable estimate for an upper temperature limit is @xmath158 and we obtain the final correlation length at finite temperature as @xmath159 although the first term on the right side is less than unity , the whole expression can still approach unity and thus even for an initial polariton wave - packet with finite energy an almost perfect wigner crystal can be created .    </S>",
    "<S> an important question is how to observe the crystalline structure of the stored dsps . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by turning the stationary excitations back into propagating photons , following standard light retrieval techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however this must be done by instantaneously switching on the control field as an adiabatic switch - on would just invert the generation process . the resulting regular train of single - photon pulses that leaves the medium </S>",
    "<S> can then be detected using standard correlation measurement techniques @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary we showed that the combination of eit with interacting rydberg gases leads to strongly interacting light - matter particles , termed rydberg polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the experimental requirements needed to obtain a quasi - long - range - ordered ground - state corresponding to a moving - frame wigner crystal of rydberg excitations in 1d by mapping the problem to a luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> numerical and analytic results showed that under slow - light conditions the kinetic energy contributions in the longitudinal direction are too large to enter the density - wave dominated regime . using a time - dependent luttinger liquid approach we showed , however , that decelerating a light pulse in a gas of rydberg atoms to a full stop over a sufficiently long deceleration time can create true crystalline order over a substantial fraction of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> turning the wigner - crystal of spin excitations back into electromagnetic fields by a sudden switch - on of the drive field produces a train of photons with long - range crystalline order .    </S>",
