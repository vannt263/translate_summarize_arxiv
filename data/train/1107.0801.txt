    "in the semileptonic @xmath6 decay with a meson @xmath7 and a charged lepton @xmath8 , the @xmath9 pair involves no direct qcd interaction so that the theoretical description of the amplitude can be reduced to a simple form with the @xmath10 transition .",
    "for example , the rate for @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath12 , where the form factor @xmath13 for the @xmath14 transition depends on the momentum transfer squared , @xmath15 .",
    "this benefits the precision measurement of @xmath16 , where @xmath16 is one of the least known cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "as long as we choose a point @xmath17 in the decay spectrum , the corresponding data point with other parameters can be fixed to extract the value of @xmath16 .",
    "however , @xmath13 relies on the calculations in the qcd models , such as quark models @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , and light cone sum rules  @xcite .",
    "starting with @xmath18 and @xmath16 , one is allowed to inversely extract the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath13 in different @xmath15 intervals from the measured data  @xcite .",
    "the extraction compared with various theoretical models hence improves the knowledge of @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , such extraction also provides crosschecks for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 transition form factors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the size of the gluonic singlet contribution  @xcite to the @xmath21 transition to explain the unexpectedly large two - body hadronic @xmath22 decay rate has been constrained by measuring @xmath23 decays @xcite .",
    "similar to the mesonic cases , it should be interesting to extend the study to baryonic decay modes , such as @xmath24 with @xmath25 being a baryon pair , to investigate the @xmath26 transition form factors , which have been used as theoretical inputs in the three - body @xmath27 decays .    the factorizable amplitudes for the three - body baryonic @xmath28 decays are normally classified into current and transition parts , given by @xmath29 respectively , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the weak currents .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath32 in @xmath33 are presented as the timelike baryonic form factors , for which the theoretical calculations are available , such as the approach of the pqcd counting rules @xcite .",
    "consequently , the observed branching ratios for @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 @xcite and @xmath36  @xcite can be explained due to the @xmath33-like amplitudes  @xcite . on the other hand , the measured decays of @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite , and @xmath39 , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] , the decay of @xmath47 is also a @xmath40 type as @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the observation of @xmath49 shall directly determine the transition form factors , which have been widely used to explain the @xmath27 data as theoretical inputs . in analogy with the timelike baryonic form factors , similar momentum dependences of the transition form factors",
    "may be chosen , which can be justified by investigating the shape of the invariant mass spectrum for the @xmath50 decay .",
    "moreover , we expect that the measurements of the angular distributions in @xmath51 will provide some information to understand the unexpectedly large angular distribution asymmetries of @xmath52 @xcite .    at present",
    ", the cleo collaboration has given an experimental upper limit :  @xcite @xmath53 while the theoretical estimation has only been done for the inclusive @xmath5 decays with charmless dibaryons , given by @xcite @xmath54 in this paper , we concentrate on the exclusive four - body semileptonic baryonic decay of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , or @xmath57 ) .",
    "in particular , we will study its decay branching ratio in the sm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we provide the formalism , in which we show the decay amplitude and rate of @xmath55 along with the definitions of the transition form factors of @xmath41 .",

    "the regions for the five variables of the phase space are given by @xmath96",
    "in our numerical analysis , we take @xmath97 from the pdg @xcite . to deal with @xmath73 and @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ figi ] ) , it is helpful to use the approach of the pqcd counting rules again , where with @xmath98 flavor and @xmath99 spin symmetries the vector and axial - vector currents are incorporated as two chiral currents in the large t limit  @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath73 and @xmath72 from the vector currents are related by another set of constants @xmath100 and @xmath101 from the chiral currents .",
    "explicitly , for the @xmath102 transition form factors we have  @xcite @xmath103 with @xmath104 , where their values are determined by fitting the data of the total branching ratios , invariant mass spectra , and angular distributions measured in the @xmath27 decays . to illustrate our results , we adopt the values in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath105 thus , the total branching ratios of @xmath49 are found to be @xmath106 where the two errors in eq .",

    "( [ inputd ] ) .    since our result on @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ pred ] ) is around @xmath114 , which is the same order of magnitude as those of the well measured mesonic @xmath115 decays at belle and babar , such as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , this four - body mode should be observed at these b - factories  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , the @xmath107 decay inherits the same threshold enhancement as those in the three - body baryonic @xmath0 decays , resulting from the adoption of @xmath118 for the momentum dependence in the @xmath102 transition form factors . the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b reflects the fact that in the helicity structure the amplitude of the @xmath119 pair is proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our study of @xmath49 is similar to that of @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "the terms related to @xmath122 and @xmath123 in the @xmath102 transition form factors give the main contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "since the pair of the left - handed electron and the right - handed anti - neutrino in the helicity structure behaves as one of the polarization vector @xmath124 with @xmath125 , leading to @xmath126 , the contributions from @xmath127 and @xmath128 disappear .",
    "those from @xmath129 and @xmath130 are effectively small due to the tiny @xmath131 . as the branching ratio receives the most contribution near the threshold area",
    ", the @xmath132(@xmath133)-accompanied term @xmath134 is suppressed . moreover , since the terms of @xmath122 and @xmath123 contain @xmath135 , we have the relation @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 , which explains why @xmath122 and @xmath123 prevail over other terms in the @xmath49 decay .    finally , it is interesting to point out that the angular distribution asymmetries in eq .",
    "( [ as ] ) in the @xmath49 decay are sensitive to new physics , such as the currents of @xmath139 and @xmath140 beyond the sm .",
    "note that @xmath141 in eq .",
    "( [ angbl ] ) ( see also fig . [",
    "fig3]c ) is caused by the @xmath142 pair of @xmath143 in the sm , which forms a polarization vector @xmath124 to couple to the left - handed helicity state of the virtual weak boson @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , a new physics with the @xmath139 current , which lets the @xmath145 pair to be another polarization state @xmath146 , must result in the deviation of @xmath147 in eq .",
    "( [ angbl ] ) .",
    "apart from a direct @xmath148 violation  @xcite , @xmath49 can easily create @xmath149-odd triple product correlations ( tpc s ) to test direct @xmath149 violation effects .",
    "since the three - momenta of @xmath68 and those of @xmath9 are not in the same plane , @xmath150 can be a nonzero tpc observable . like the case of @xmath151 in @xmath152  @xcite with @xmath153 denoting the @xmath154 spin , there are other tpc observables @xmath155 and @xmath156 in @xmath49 .",
    "these rich tpc observables are expected to be useful to test new physics in the advantage of @xmath157 of order @xmath158 much larger than the sensitivity of @xmath159 in the @xmath115 factories .",
    "we have examined the four - body semileptonic baryonic @xmath0 decay of @xmath49 in the sm , which proceeds via @xmath160 at the quark level .",
    "the transition form factors of @xmath102 , which are well studied in the three - body baryonic @xmath27 decays , play the key role in the theoretical calculation .",
    "we have found that @xmath161 for @xmath162 , respectively , which are just a little below the cleo s upper limit of @xmath4 for @xmath163 but much larger than the previous estimations of @xmath164 for the inclusive modes of @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the four - body decays of @xmath49 , in particular the light charged leoton modes , should be observed by the b - factories of belle and babar as well as future b - factories , such as super - belle and lhcb .",
