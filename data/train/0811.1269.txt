    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is one of the key quantum phenomena which shaped the physics of the 20th century . in bec",
    "a macroscopic part of the atoms is in the state with lowest energy .",
    "well known examples are the superfluid phase of @xmath4he and laser cooled atoms in magnetic or optical traps , which are a playground for the demonstration of generic quantum phenomena like the appearance of quantized vortices , the josephson effect etc . @xcite .",
    "a more complicated situation arises if these phenomena are studied in a random environment like in porous media .",
    "experimentally , superfluidity was shown to persist in random media like vycor or aerogel glass @xcite which contain pores filling from @xmath5 up to @xmath6 of the material .",
    "partial coverage of the pores leads to a reduction of the transition temperature : the transition temperature ranks from @xmath7 for full - pore vycor to about @xmath8 for low coverage films in vycor .",
    "finally , for very low coverage superfluidity corresponding to less than @xmath9 monolayers the superfluidity vanishes completely even at @xmath10 .",
    "one must presume that the helium is strongly localized there .",
    "the remaining helium atoms were considered to form an inert  layer which screens the random potential once the density of the helium atoms is again increased .",
    "the experimental investigations on bec in disordered environments concentrated on critical behavior of the superfluid density and specific heat at decreasing coverage of the porous media @xcite .",
    "more recently , bose - einstein condensates have been studied in optical traps which superpose a harmonic and a random potential @xcite .",
    "most of the papers concentrate on the possibility of anderson localization in effectively one - dimensional condensates .",
    "in contrast to random potentials in crystals , the random speckle potential has a typical correlations length of the order of @xmath11 which is about of the same order as the transverse extension of the atomic cloud .",
    "the longitudinal extension is about @xmath12 to @xmath13 times larger @xcite . in most of the experiments ,",
    "the expanding density profile after switching off the harmonic potential was analyzed .",
    "for weak random potential lye et al .",
    "@xcite found essentially the density profile corresponding to the thomas - fermi theory .",
    "for larger values of the random potential these authors found a stripe - like pattern of about @xmath14 spacing and damped dipole oscillations .",
    "for very strong disorder the atoms are localized in the minima of the random potential .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite also studied _ in situ _ and found fragmentation of the bec . in some papers",
    "the superposition of a periodic plus a random potential was considered to enrich the number of possible phases @xcite .",
    "schulte et al .",
    "@xcite found features in the expanding condensate like pronounced fringes and changes in the axial size of the central peak which they trace back to the random potential .",
    "theoretical investigations of bose gases or fluids in a disordered environment focused on three issues :    \\(i ) the critical behavior at the normal to superfluid transition in the vicinity of the transition temperature @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath1 denotes the boson density . for fixed disorder strength @xmath15 decreases with decreasing boson density @xmath1 and eventually vanishes for @xmath16 .",
    "( ii ) the description of zero - temperature quantum phase transition from the superfluid to a non - superfluid ( glassy ) phase taking place at the critical value @xmath17 of the boson density @xcite . (",
    "iii ) the microscopic description of the superfluid density ( and the condensate ) in a disordered environment in the region of comparatively high average density of the gas @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the problem of the bose gas in the random environment attracted so much attention because it connects two central ideas of the condensed matter theory : the bose condensation and localization . especially the problem of the interplay of the interaction and disorder is intriguing .",
    "so far this problem was studied for fermi gas @xcite , but only in the case of a weak disorder it could be done rigorously . therefore the delocalization induced by interaction remains beyond the frameworks of the theory , though most of theorists are sure that it does exist . in the case of the bose gas",
    "the situation is even more involved since there is no pauli principle which delocalizes the ideal fermi gas in 3 dimensions .",
    "our study shows that the interaction delocalizes the bose gas at some critical density .    since in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves mainly to zero temperature , below we give a brief review only of the works mentioned in ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "( ii ) the quantum phase transition , taking place at zero temperature and @xmath20 , exhibits in general a critical behavior different from that observed at finite @xmath15 .",
    "this is because in the quantum domain static and dynamic critical behavior are intertwined .",
    "this quantum phase transition was considered by ma , halperin and lee @xcite who mapped the problem onto a @xmath21 dimensional classical @xmath22 theory with disorder completely correlated in time .",
    "their description gives rise to new critical exponents which were calculated by @xmath23-expansion around @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "this work has been criticized by fisher et al .",
    "one conclusion of the work of fisher et al .",
    "@xcite is that the dynamic critical exponent @xmath25 should be equal to the dimension @xmath0 of the system in all space dimensions .",
    "this result has been disputed recently @xcite . indeed ,",
    "quantum monte carlo studies show @xmath26 for two - dimensional system , in discrepancy with the relation @xmath27 @xcite .    some arguments of the work by fisher et al .",
    "@xcite rely on the treatment of giamarchi and schulz @xcite who found the superfluid to insulator transition in one dimension .",
    "this transition happens at arbitrary disorder by increasing the interaction to a sufficiently large value .",
    "the fact that the transition into the non - superfluid phase happens at increasing interaction seems paradoxical , but it can be explained by the increase of quantum fluctuations of the phase . as we will show , for weak interaction there is a second transition resulting from the competition between the disorder and the interaction .",
    "we believe that namely this transition has its counterparts in higher dimension and is observed in experiments with cooled gases .",
    "\\(iii ) the fate of the inert layer and deeply localized ( lifshitz ) states was discussed by lee and gunn @xcite without specific predictions to be checked by experiments .",
    "more recently the reduction of the superfluid and the condensate density deeply in the superfluid phase was considered microscopically by huang and meng @xcite .",
    "these authors used the bogoliubov transformation and found a decrease of the superfluid density and of the condensate if disorder is taken into account .",
    "the corrections to both quantities are proportional to @xmath28 in our terms .",
    "thus this approach is restricted to weak disorder and @xmath18 .",
    "these results have been confirmed and extended by other authors @xcite .",
    "all these works used the approximation of weak disorder .",
    "the extrapolation of their results to the range of strong disorder made in @xcite was illegitimate .",
    "zhou @xcite argued that the @xmath10 transition to the superfluid phase is of the percolation type .",
    "lugan et al .",
    "@xcite considered a bec in a special potential which is random in one and parabolic in the two remaining directions .",
    "the disorder is bounded from below but not from above .",
    "using the numerical solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation as well as a mean field like approach they identified three different regimes : the lifshitz glass , the fragmented bec and the non - fragmented bec . because of the difference in the models ( our potential includes randomness in all directions ) a direct comparison with our results derived below is not possible , except for the one - dimensional case when the harmonic trap potential is negligible . only in this case , and using our characteristics of the random potential , it can be shown that their approach gives results for the fragmented bec comparable to ours .",
    "however we do not see a difference between the lifshitz glass and the fragmented bec . moreover , lugan et al .",
    "@xcite did not obtain important geometrical and energetic characteristics of the fragmented state vs. the average density of particles as we did based on a simple physical picture of the fragmentation .",
    "more recent papers considered the dynamic consequences of anderson localization in bec and do not directly overlap with our work @xcite . using arguments similar to those used in a published work by two of the authors @xcite , shklovskii @xcite independently and practically simultaneously arrived at the same conclusions about the critical value of density at which the transition between an insulating and the superfluid phase takes place , but he did not give the description of the localized phase .    the aim of this paper is to develop an alternative approach to the quantum phase transition starting from deeply localized state . we deliver a detailed study of the deeply localized state of the bose gas in a random potential .",
    "such a state appears at sufficiently low average density .",
    "we show , that in this region the bose - einstein condensate decays into remote fragments of small sizes .",
    "we give a rather transparent qualitative and quantitative geometrical description of the localized state .",
    "we show that , at a critical density @xmath17 which we express in terms of the disorder characteristics and interaction strength , the increasing tunneling of particles between fragments leads to transition from the random singlet state to the coherent superfluid .",
    "the localized state can exist in several different regimes .",
    "these regimes as well as their quantitative characteristics strongly depend on the ratio of two basic length scales characterizing the disorder : the larkin length @xmath29 and the correlation length @xmath30 .",
    "we extended our consideration to a practically important situation of the bose gas confined by a harmonic trap . in this case",
    "the gas forms a cloud which size is determined by the energy minimization .",
    "we demonstrate that all regimes which appear for the gas in the box appear also in the trap driven by the number of particles and other parameters .",
    "our consideration is based on theory of deeply localized single - particle states in an uncorrelated random potential given in seminal works by i. lifshitz @xcite , zittartz and langer @xcite , and halperin and lax @xcite .",
    "their predecessors keldysh and proshko @xcite and kane @xcite studied electron density of state in a smooth random potential having in mind semiconductors .",
    "these works were extended and detailized in references @xcite . in this work",
    "we propose a modest extension and simplification of their arguments to find some geometrical and physical characteristics of these state necessary for our purposes . on the other hand ,",
    "our theory can be considered as a generalization of their instanton - type theory incorporating the self - consistent field of the interacting particles .",
    "we consider the ground state of the system at zero temperature .",
    "it is not always reachable since the system may be frozen in a metastable state .",
    "it is therefore important that nevertheless the ground state occurs to be reachable in a sufficiently wide range of parameters .",
    "we also demonstrate that properties of the localized states of the bose gas are rich enough and that they are available for the experimental study .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we characterize the random potential . in section [ single ]",
    "we consider the single - particle deeply localized states in 3 dimensions for the uncorrelated random potential obeying the gaussian distribution . in section",
    "[ gas - in - box ] we consider how the dilute bose gas fills the deep fluctuation potential wells in this case . in section [ transition ] the transition from the random singlet to the coherent superfluid state is considered .",

    "we consider the bose gas subjected to simultaneous action of a harmonic trap and random potential .",

    "the transition from fractal to strongly localized states evolves .",

    "is that the fluctuation potential well @xmath31 has the same characteristic linear size @xmath86 as the wave function @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that the maximum probability requires the bound state with the fixed energy @xmath77 to be the only bound state in the potential well .",
    "otherwise , at the same energy , we need a deeper well , i.e. larger @xmath87 . for the same reason the fluctuation well must have the spherical shape .",

    "let us consider the probability or the part of volume @xmath93 occupied by the wells with the radius less than @xmath86 or the energy less than @xmath94 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath93 contains an exponential factor ( [ exp ] ) and some preexponent .",
    "since @xmath93 is a dimensionless value , the preexponent must be a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath95:@xmath96 the function @xmath97 must be much slower function of its argument than the exponent .",

    "it can be extracted from the work by j. cardy @xcite : @xmath100 for the uncorrelated disorder .",

    "the potential wells percolate and tunneling is not small , but the states still are not propagating due to the anderson localization @xcite .",
    "in the ground state of an ideal bose gas in a large box with the gaussian random potential all particles are located at the deepest fluctuation level . in the box of the cubic shape with the side @xmath116",
    "the deepest level which occurs with probability of the order of 1 has the radius @xmath86 determined by equation : @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "note that the prefactor introduces a correction to the denominator of the order of @xmath119 which can be neglected .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath120 .",
    "such a state is highly non - ergodic since the location and the depth of the deepest level strongly depends on a specific realization of the disordered potential .",
    "therefore the average energy per particle and other properties averaged over the ensemble has nothing in common with the properties of a specific sample .",
    "even an infinitely small interaction immediately changes the situation : the system becomes ergodic in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. when first the size of the system grows to infinity and then the interaction goes to zero .",
    "for example , the energy per particle in sufficiently large volume coincides with its average over the ensemble .",
    "the reason of such a sharp change is that , at any small but finite interaction , the particles can not more fill one well since their repulsion finally overcomes the attraction to the potential well .",
    "they will be redistributed over multiple wells . since the distribution of wells in different parts of sufficiently large volume passes all possible random configurations with proper ensemble probabilities , the ergodicity is established . in this section",
    "we find how the interacting particles eventually fills deep single - particle levels simultaneously changing their size and shape by their self - consistent field .",
    "similar idea was considered in the work by lugan _",
