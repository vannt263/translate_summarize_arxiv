    "the ability to manipulate electron spin degree of freedom in semiconductors has become an important issue for the realization of spintronic devices.@xcite usual ways to manipulate spins are proposed by directly applying magnetic field or exploiting the spin - orbit interaction through a gate voltage@xcite and/or strain field.@xcite in addition , applying a drift electric field also provides an approach to manipulate spin , by which the dependence of spin - orbit coupling on electron momentum is exploited and an effective magnetic field can be induced.@xcite however , these manipulations also affect spin relaxation and dephasing ( r&d ) time,@xcite which is an essential time scale for the design of spin - based devices .",
    "moreover , as the goal of semiconductor spintronics is to combine `` traditional '' semiconductor electronics with the utilization of the spin state and most current electronic devices are performed at high - field transport condition , the study of drift electric field on spin r&d is therefore essential .",

    "the inter - valley scattering can lead to interesting phenomena , such as the charge gunn effect in gaas,@xcite which comes from the different mobilities in different valleys due to the different effective masses .",
    "studies focusing on scattering and transport between different valleys without the spin degree of freedom have been performed long time ago.@xcite when spin is considered , the different spin - orbit couplings and the different effective @xmath3-factors , together with the well known different momentum relaxations at different valleys may lead to complex spin r&d phenomena .",

    "inset of ( a ) : fraction of electrons in @xmath1 valleys against electric field.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    from the figure one can see that in each case , the peak in @xmath105-@xmath99 curve ( first discussed in sec .",
    "iiib ) is more pronounced and shows up at a relatively higher electric field when @xmath75 is decreased .",
    "this is due to two facts : first , the hot - electron effect mentioned previously in sec .",
    "iiia is more important when @xmath75 is low.@xcite second , when temperature is low , the @xmath2-@xmath1 inter - valley exchange of electrons in low electric field regime is marginal due to the low electron density in @xmath1 valleys [ see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) ] .",
    "thus the enhancement of spin relaxation by @xmath1 valleys does not come into effect markedly until the electric field is high enough .",
    "it is also shown from the figure that in the low electric field regime ( @xmath150  kv / cm ) , the spin relaxation can be reduced by increasing temperature and/or magnetic field and/or impurity density .",
    "the reduction of the spin relaxation due to higher temperature and impurity density corresponds to the hot - electron effect in strong scattering limit  the increase of temperature and/or adding more impurities strengthen the scattering , thus reduce the spin r&d .",
    "the main effect of static magnetic field in the low electric field regime is to reduce the spin r&d by forcing spins to undergo a larmor precession around it and thus reducing inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite    finally one notices from the figure that when @xmath99 is high enough , the effects of lattice temperature , impurity density , and magnetic field are marginal . in this regime , the inter - valley electron - phonon scattering",
    "is considerably strengthened due to the high hot - electron temperatures , and thus dominates and becomes insensitive to the background temperature .",
    "thus the changes in lattice temperature and other kinds of scattering cause little discrepancy in spin relaxation . meanwhile , the inhomogeneous broadening is highly enhanced as well in this high electric field regime .",
    "therefore the finite magnetic field has little restriction on inhomogeneous broadening and affects spin relaxation marginally .",
    "consequently , the spin relaxation under high electric field tends to be identical and insensitive to the lattice temperature , magnetic field and impurity density .",
    "in conclusion , we investigate the multi - valley spin relaxation in @xmath0-type gaas qws in the presence of in - plane electric field under high temperature ( @xmath151  k ) , by applying the ksbe approach . due to the small well width in this investigation , electrons at @xmath2 and @xmath1 valleys determine the properties of spin dynamics at high electric field .",
    "we discuss the effect of inter - valley scattering on spin relaxation , the spin precession properties , and the spin relaxation under different conditions , such as lattice temperatures , magnetic fields and impurity densities .",
    "first , the negative differential electric conductance , which is essential for the charge gunn effect , is reproduced .",
    "meanwhile , the hot - electron temperature is also investigated , showing that @xmath2 valley has _",
    "two _ distinct temperatures .",
    "one is for electrons in the energy regime which overlaps with that of @xmath1 valleys , and shows the _ same _ hot - electron temperature of those in @xmath1 valleys ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the other is for electrons in the lower energy regime of @xmath2 valley ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "it is shown that @xmath152 .",
    "the identical electron temperature in the overlapped energy regime of @xmath2 and @xmath1 valleys is due to the strong inter - valley scattering whereas @xmath152 results from the smaller effective mass in @xmath2 valley .",
    "the spin relaxation time @xmath105 first increases and then decreases with the electric field , especially at low temperatures .",
    "the first increase of @xmath105 in low electric field regime is due to the hot - electron effect in the strong scattering limit . whereas the following decrease of @xmath105 in the high electric field regime is mainly due to the fast spin relaxation in @xmath1 valleys ( originating from the much stronger spin - orbit coupling at @xmath1 valleys ) and strong @xmath2-@xmath1 inter - valley scattering .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 valleys are shown to play the role of a `` drain '' of the total spin polarization .",
    "it is also shown that the @xmath2-@xmath1 inter - valley electron - phonon scattering is responsible for the inter - valley scattering .",
    "the contribution of @xmath2-@xmath1 inter - valley electron - electron coulomb scattering is marginal as it does not cause any electron exchange between different valleys .",
    "moreover , due to the strong @xmath2-@xmath1 inter - valley scattering as well as the strong inhomogeneous broadening in @xmath1 valleys , electrons in @xmath1 valleys possess almost the same spin relaxation rate and spin precession period as those in @xmath2 valley .",
    "it is further shown that this feature still holds when a static magnetic field is applied .",
    "actually , in our investigation ( @xmath153  t ) , the spin precession frequency is determined by electrons at @xmath2 valley , despite the fact that @xmath154 is much larger in magnitude than @xmath155 .",
    "this is because the net electric - field - induced magnetic field from @xmath1 valleys is zero , and the effect of static magnetic field in @xmath1 valleys can not surpass the much stronger inhomogeneous broadening as well as frequent exchange of electrons from @xmath2 valley .",
    "we also investigate the effects of temperature , magnetic field and impurity on spin relaxation .",
    "when the electric field is not too high , the spin relaxation can be reduced by increasing temperature , magnetic field , and impurity density . however , when the electric field is high enough , spin relaxation time is dominated by the @xmath2-@xmath1 inter - valley electron - phonon scattering and becomes insensitive to temperature , impurity density and magnetic field .",
    "finally we remark on the possibility of the `` spin gunn effect '' in gaas qws .",
    "first , as pointed out in our previous work,@xcite the feasibility of drift - diffusion model used in ref .   is valid only in system without dresselhaus / rashba spin - orbit coupling . for zinc - blende semiconductors , even without magnetic field , electron spins can flip due to the dresselhaus / rashba spin - orbit coupling , let alone an effective magnetic field induced by electric field via the same spin - orbit coupling . therefore , although with the spin - dependent mobilities , electrons with opposite spins can experience frequent spin - flip .",
    "second , our calculations show that in high electric field regime , spin relaxation time decreases effectively with electric field .",
    "this is due to the hot - electron effect , together with the fast spin relaxation in the upper valleys .",
    "therefore , the condition for `` spin gunn effect '' proposed in ref .",
    "can hardly be realized due to the short spin relaxation time in gaas qws .",
