    "in the last decades our knowledge of the high redshift ( z @xmath2 2 ) universe has significantly increased .",
    "the observational technique that allowed such galaxies to be found , in a significant number , is the dropout technique @xcite .",
    "it detects lyman break galaxies by the flux discontinuity due to their lyman limit absorption @xcite . since 1998 , narrow band surveys reported the detection of ly@xmath0 emission from objects in the redshift range 2.4 @xmath3 z @xmath3 6.5 @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission not only allows galaxies to be detected at very high redshifts , but also gives a valuable star formation diagnostic and facilitates the study of large scale structures at high redshift . with spectroscopic surveys",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission line profiles can be studied @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , provides the possibility of testing models of the physical parameters of the lyman @xmath0 emitters and to derive constraints on their stellar populations and their gas and dust content @xcite .    here",
    "we present the results of a survey at z @xmath1 3.1 carried out with the multislit imaging spectroscopy technique @xcite ( msis ) with fors2 on ut1 .",
    "msis is a blind search technique that consists of the combined use of a mask of parallel slits , a narrowband filter , and a dispersing element .",
    "it obtains the spectra of all emission line objects that happen to lie behind the mask slits .",
    "our main purpose is to detect the [ oiii ] @xmath45007 line emission for planetary nebulae ( pns ) , in order to study the kinematic properties of the intracluster light ( icl ) in the central regions of nearby ( @xmath3 100 mpc ) clusters of galaxies @xcite . by dispersing the sky noise on many pixels",
    ", the technique enables measurements of very faint fluxes . thus msis surveys are also suitable for the detection of the redshifted @xmath5   emission line from high - redshift ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "data were collected in visitor mode during 2006 march 26 - 28 , using the fors2 spectrograph on ut1 .",
    "the observed area covers the central region of the hydra i cluster , around ngc 3311 , at @xmath6 10@xmath736@xmath842.8@xmath9 , @xmath10= -27@xmath1131@xmath842@xmath9 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the fors2 field of view ( fov ) is @xmath12 wide , corresponding to @xmath1 10000 kpc@xmath13 , and it is imaged onto a mosaic of two ccds , rebinned @xmath14 in the readout .",
    "we used two narrow band filters , one centered at @xmath15   and a second one at @xmath16  , both with a fwhm of @xmath17  . in this way we are able to detect ly@xmath0 emission lines in the redshift range 3.12 @xmath3 z @xmath3 3.21 .",
    "spectra were obtained with the gris-600b grism , which has a spectral resolution of 0.75  / pixel at 5075  .",
    "the msis mask is made of @xmath18 slits , each of them @xmath19 wide and @xmath20 long .",
    "each slit is projected along the dispersion axis onto @xmath1 40 rebinned pixels .",
    "the effective area imaged by the slits is @xmath1 7056 arcsec@xmath13 , that is @xmath1 4.5% of the whole fors2 fov . in order to cover the whole field ,",
    "the msis mask was stepped 15 times on the sky to fill the region between two adjacent slits . for each mask position 3 exposures , of @xmath21 sec , were taken , ensuring a proper cosmic ray subtraction .",
    "the seeing during the three observing nights was in the range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "we can detect emission line objects with a flux completeness limit of @xmath1 3.4 @xmath2410@xmath25 erg @xmath26s@xmath27 , and their positions and radial velocities can be measured at the same time . with this instrumental set up and total exposure time , monochromatic point like",
    "emissions appear in the final images as unresolved sources with a width of @xmath1 6 pixels both in the spatial and in the wavelength direction .",
    "therefore , the fwhm spatial resolution is 1\".1 and the fwmh spectral resolution is @xmath28 km s@xmath27 .",
    "data reduction was carried out following the procedure described in @xcite . after bias subtraction ,",
    "the images were co - added and the continuum light from the two hydra i galaxies was subtracted , with an fmedian filtering using a window of @xmath29 pixels .",
    "the 2d stacked spectra of the emission sources were then extracted , rectified , wavelength and flux calibrated .",
    "the total number of emission sources detected is 86 .",
    "on the basis of the flux calibration the @xmath30 limit on the continuum is @xmath1 7@xmath2410@xmath31 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27@xmath27 .",
    "continuum fluxes were calculated in the 60   wavelength range covered by the filter in which the emission line was detected .    in a first classification , all objects with unresolved emission lines and",
    "no continuum were classified as pn candidates ; the remainder as background galaxy candidates .",
    "the pn candidate sample likely contains a fraction of unresolved ly@xmath0 emitters without continuum which are not included in the present study .",
    "in the background galaxy sample 6 objects are classified as [ oii ] emitters ; they are characterized by an emission line with a clearly visible continuum at all wavelengths .",
    "the remaining 20 objects are classified as candidate ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "they include sources with resolved emission lines , either spatially or in wavelength or both , without continuum , and sources with resolved / unresolved emission lines and continuum only to the red side of the spectrum .",
    "this classification is supported by spectroscopic follow up of similar sample of background galaxies in previous pn surveys @xcite , and by the fact that the deep sample of @xmath32 ly@xmath0 galaxies of @xcite contains few foreground [ oii ] emitting galaxies , contrary to higher redshift samples @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of the ly@xmath0 candidates ( lacs ) is shown in figure [ fvfs ] .",
    "the emission lines of all objects were fitted by simple gaussian profiles , both in the spatial and in the dispersion direction .",
    "for all the lacs , fig.[fvfs ] ( upper left panel ) shows the fwhm of the gaussian profiles along the spatial direction vs.  the fwhm of the gaussian profiles along the dispersion direction .",
