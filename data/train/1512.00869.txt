    "the standard model ( sm ) is a very efficient and well tested theory that explains almost all the experimental observations in elementary particle physics .",
    "however , there are several observations that the sm does not address and which motivate the extensions beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "two prominent examples of unresolved observations are the flavour problem , and the observation of collisionless , cold dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the fact that the fermions are arranged in three generations has been addressed recently by ref .",
    "@xcite with an argument that connects the sm gauge group with the number of fermion generations . however , the puzzling pattern of hierarchical masses and small fermion mixing in the quark sector , opposed to the large mixing in the lepton sector , is beyond present understanding .",
    "furthermore , the sm does not offer a suitable candidate that can take the rle of the dm to make up the observed relic density that is about five times more abundant than baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "the experimental status of dm signals are not conclusive : there are some hints for dm signals in indirect detection experiments , but there is no unambiguous signal in direct detection experiments , see e.g.  refs .  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", a new unbroken symmetry can be used to explain the dm properties by preventing decays of the dm into sm particles .",
    "so - called `` top - down '' approaches often generate a `` dark sector '' , as is the case e.g.  for supersymmetry ( susy ) with @xmath0 parity , extra dimensions and grand unified theories ( guts ) . in the above mentioned examples",
    ", at least one new symmetry is introduced , which distinguishes a new sector from the sm .",
    "symmetries are also the most promising bsm approach to deal with the flavour problem , i.e.  the peculiar structure exhibited by the masses and mixings of the fermions . in this approach ,",
    "the symmetry is often referred to as a family symmetry ( fs ) , as it relates the generations of fermions , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "fss are particularly appealing in bsm theories with additional particles , such as additional higgs fields @xcite , as the fs will control the flavour problem , while the theory also addresses other shortcomings of the sm , for instance by providing suitable dm candidates @xcite .",
    "more often than not , the introduced dm candidate is an additional particle ( scalar or fermion ) charged under an abelian symmetry .",
    "usually the simplest possibility of a @xmath1 symmetry is evoked , because the dm phenomenology does not depend very much on the explicit choice for the stabilising symmetry , as long as it prevents the decay of the lightest particle charged under it .",
    "the protective symmetry for the dm leads to having two different symmetries at the heart of the theory : the non - abelian ( gauge ) symmetry in the sm sector , and the symmetry in the dm sector .",
    "the most often studied interaction between the dark and the visible sector is the so - called `` higgs portal '' , where the dark and visible sector interact via the higgs boson , and which leads to the sm final states from dm annihilation to be spread over all the kinematically available sm particle content according to their yukawa couplings .",
    "recently , the possibility of a deeper connection between the dm and flavour were studied in different frameworks by independent groups .",
    "the generic properties of flavoured dm ",
    "the flavon or familon portal  were investigated for an abelian fs @xcite , where it was shown that , compared to the higgs portal , the dm in the familon portal setup allows for smaller dm masses since the direct detection constraints lose some of their predictivity .",
    "a very detailed study investigated the connection of flavoured ( fermionic or scalar ) dm and the sm to be given by a gauged fs , where the yukawa matrices are promoted into physical scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the dm and fs mass scale should be @xmath2tev to match the observational constraints .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite a minimal flavor violation scenario was compared with an @xmath3 fs , where the interaction between sm and dm is mediated by a fs singlet .    in this paper , we study the phenomenological implications of effective models with non - abelian fs and flavoured dm .",
    "we consider non - abelian fss because the observed leptonic mixing shows hints that those are preferred when fitting the observed patterns @xcite .",
    "typically the fs is broken by familon fields developing a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which can explain the observed flavour structure .",
    "for fermionic dm particles that are singlets under the sm gauge group and reside in non - trivial multiplets of the fs , the interaction between visible and dark sector can be mediated exclusively by the _ familons",
    "_ , which are also often referred to as _ flavons _ in the literature .",
    "the models considered here share the generic feature of a dark sector , that is charged under non - abelian fs , together with scalar familon fields .",
    "they are derived from realistic uv - complete fs models in a susy ( and in one case a gut ) framework , and they are simplified such that the number of free model parameters can be related to observational constraints . in the following",
    "we show , that with familons and dm masses around the electroweak scale , the observed relic abundance as well as experimental constraints on flavour changing neutral currents can be accommodated .",
    "furtherore we show , that specific signatures and predictions for collider phenomenology are possible , and that the present experimental ( non-)observation of deviations from the sm predictions is already putting bounds on combinations of the model parameters .",
    "the fs models are expected to be representative for the class of models where the interactions between dark and sm sector are exclusively given by the non - abelian familon portal  much in the same way that more generic susy models make similar predictions in terms of the dark sector compared to the mssm .",
    "they are not intended to explain the sm phenomenology in the fermion sector , but rather to capture the phenomenological features of the non - abelian familon portal to the here considered dark sector .",
    "we note that an interesting and new feature of the familon portal that we explore in this article is the possibility that the underlying fs can give rise to observational features , that may allow to distinguish one fs from another one ( and in particular determine if the fs is non - abelian ) .",
    "we therefore aim to highlight generic features of this type of dm . in terms of discriminating power",
    ", we investigate observables that may help to distinguish different models , e.g.  whether the familon is coupling both to quarks and leptons ( as in guts ) , as opposed to the familon coupling exclusively to the leptons .",
    "regarding the latter , we further distinguish the cases of the familon coupling either to the charged , or the neutral lepton sector .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : dmstudy ] we introduce three effective models with fermionic dm candidates and a different non - abelian familon portal . in the same section , the relic abundance constraint as well as relevant other constraints are briefly studied . in section",
    "[ sec : colliderpheno ] , we discuss the production of familons at lepton and hadron colliders , and the constraints resulting from a selection of present experimental observations . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarise our results and , after a brief discussion , present our conclusions .",
    "in fs models , the sm fermions are usually embedded in a specific representation of the fs , and extra scalar sm gauge singlet fields  the familons  are introduced , that acquire vevs with a specific alignment , such that the fs is broken and the fermion masses and mixings can be explained .    in this section ,",
    "we present three different flavour models based on uv - complete theories , that can lead to a realistic description of the pattern of fermions masses and mixings .",
    "the models share the general feature of additional sm gauge singlet fermions , that are introduced as dm candidates and arranged as a multiplet of the respective fs , such that it exclusively couples to the familon fields .",
    "two of the models are based on the @xmath4 symmetry , the group multiplication of which is listed in appendix [ app : a4 ] , for the chosen basis .",
    "the models are based on the uv complete models in a susy framework @xcite that account for the observed value of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therein , the sm leptons are embedded into a global @xmath4 symmetry and the experimentally observed leptonic mixing is generated through two @xmath4-triplet scalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and exclusive couplings to the charged and neutral leptons , respectively .",
    "their specific vevs are aligned through the so - called _ f - term alignment _ within the susy framework . in this type of model",
    "it is possible to extend the @xmath4 to address also the quark sector .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we choose to keep the quark fields as trivial @xmath4-singlets , which allows to fit their masses and mixings as in the sm .",
    "the third model of this section considers a fs embedding in a susy gut framework as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on @xmath8 gut and a continuous @xmath3 fs which necessarily addresses both quarks and leptons .",

    "the model further contains three familon scalar fields , singlets under the gauge groups and anti - triplets under the @xmath3 fs , which allows to form invariants with the fermions .",
    "we assume that the three familons develop non - zero vevs in different fs alignments and with different magnitudes . for clarity , we follow the notation of @xcite and include subscript in the name that is a reminder of the specific vev direction for each of the familons : the @xmath79 field has a zero in the 1st and 2nd entry @xmath80 , the @xmath81 field has a zero in the 1st entry and the other two with equal magnitudes @xmath82 , and the @xmath83 field has no zero entries and all three entries with equal magnitudes @xmath84 @xcite . in the following , we posit a hierarchy of the familon vevs , @xmath85 , which is also motivated from the gut model .    among the invariants that can be constructed with the field content introduced above , one can find terms that are connecting the fermions and scalars of the model , and can give rise to the masses of the charged fermions .",

    "@xcite for further details .",
    "we shall not consider this contribution in the following , for the sake of presentational simplicity .",
    "after symmetry breaking , i.e.  when the familon @xmath89 acquires its vev @xmath90 , the term giving rise to the mass of the 3rd generation fermions is the most relevant one from eq .  : @xmath91 the parameter @xmath92 is again the mass scale of the fn messengers that were integrated out .",
    "this term allows the familon @xmath93 to couple to the fermion current and the higgs boson .      as in the previously discussed examples",
    ", we first consider the case that the familon masses arise from the terms in the scalar potential that contain exclusively the familon fields and no explicit mass terms .",
    "then we can write down the following @xmath3 invariant tri - linear with the levi - civita tensor @xmath94 : @xmath95 if no other mass terms are included , the lightest familon remains exactly massless .",
    "we use this as a motivation to consider the mass of the lightest @xmath89 field component to be an independent parameter , arising e.g.  from small soft susy breaking mass terms such as @xmath96 , and residing on the electroweak scale .",
    "given that the sm fermions originate from the @xmath8 gut fields , the left - handed and right - handed components have the same transformation properties under the @xmath3 fs .",
    "the same argument need not be true for the dark fermions : a simple option would be to have @xmath97 as anti - triplet and @xmath98 as a triplet , in which case they could have mass terms by themselves .",
    "this is not the case we are interested in , as we require the dark sector to interact with the familon portal .",
    "we therefore choose both the left - handed and right - handed dark fermions to transform as anti - triplets under @xmath3 fs , which can lead to the simple invariant term @xmath99 and results in a mass matrix for the dark fermions of the form of eq .  .",
    "explicitly , the dark fermions couple directly to the familon fields via the following yukawa terms : @xmath100 the combination of @xmath101 , with @xmath102 fixed , corresponds to a specific fermion mass eigenstate , which we label @xmath103 , where the superscript @xmath104 is a part of the label .",

    "the effective interaction of familons with the quark currents allows the production of the familon fields via gluon fusion , analogously to the higgs boson .",

    "another production mechanism for familons is familon strahlung , which occurs when a quark changes flavour while radiating off a familon , in particular when the initial quark s mass is larger than the familon mass @xcite .",
    "familon strahlung can be the most efficient production mechanism for the familons . from the familon - quark interaction as defined in eq .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : familonstrahlung ] .",
    "we note , that for @xmath149 tev and 13 tev , with @xmath156 and @xmath157 gev , a production cross section of @xmath158 pb and @xmath159 pb , respectively , are possible .",
    "there is one more contribution to familon production , that comes from the mixing term in the scalar potential , @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "it appears pointless , however , to search for familons produced from higgs bosons , because the latter have themselves rather small production cross sections .",
    "it turns out , that the production of familons in the fusion of two goldstone bosons , i.e.  the longitudinal modes of the weak gauge bosons , are completely negligible compared to the two aforementioned production mechanisms .",
    "this is as expected , since the goldstones are coupling to the parton current @xmath137 , which results in a factor @xmath161 , with @xmath162 being the square of the center of mass energy of the parton , and @xmath163 its mass .",
    "the interactions between the higgs boson and the familon allow the heavier among the two fields to decay into the lighter one . when the mass of the lightest familon @xmath164 is less than half the higgs mass , the partial decay width of the higgs boson into @xmath165 , @xmath166 , adds to the higgs total decay width . the determination of the higgs total decay width at the lhc results in @xmath167 mev @xcite . compared to the sm prediction of @xmath168 mev , this yields the upper bound @xmath1699.7 mev , which in turn limits the product of the familon higgs coupling and the familon vev : @xmath170 this constraint on the familon - higgs coupling together with the constraints from the dm abundance observation in section [ sec : familon - nu ] imply , that , for @xmath171 , the observed relic density can only be accounted for when the dm is heavier than the sterile neutrinos and the familon - neutrino interactions are very strong .",
    "the complementary situation , given by @xmath172 allows the familon to decay into two higgs bosons , which adds to the number of di - higgs events , which provide the important measurement of the triple - higgs coupling at the lhc and all future colliders . in order to estimate the number of familon - produced di - higgs events , @xmath173",

    "the discovery is feasible when both @xmath193 and @xmath194 are order one , and @xmath195 tev .",
    "if both effective couplings are of the same magnitude as the @xmath196 yukawa coupling , i.e.  @xmath197 , a discovery of lfv would still be possible for @xmath198 gev .",

    "these decays are free of sm background , and the fcc - ee ( and cepc ) are estimated to produce @xmath200 higgs - boson events , a detection of those decays might indeed be possible .",
    "another observable that is sensitive to lfv is given by the charged lepton flavour violating ( clfv ) decays , to which non - abelian fss contribute at the one - loop level .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a very relevant constraint comes from the experimental non - observation of the process @xmath201 , that receives contributions from loops of familon and fn messengers , whenever the familon couples off - diagonally to charged leptons .",
    "the contribution from the non - abelian fs to the clhv decay rate yields an estimated lower bound on the mass scale of the fn messengers @xcite @xmath202 which does not change much with the recent update on @xmath203 of @xmath204 from the meg collaboration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of lepton universality provides a generic means of assessing new physics couplings to the lepton sector .",
    "it amounts to measuring the weak interactions of the leptons in the decay modes of various mesons , but also of the @xmath196 and @xmath205 decays themselves .",
    "the here considered non - abelian fs models by themselves do not lead to a sizeable modification of lepton universality observables , due to the familon - lepton couplings being on the order of the yukawa couplings , and the interactions being further suppressed by the messenger scale .",
    "however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the introduction of leptoquarks to fs models makes it possible to explain the recent hints for lepton non - universal flavour decays from the lhcb measurement @xcite @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "the fs and familon vevs considered here very naturally justify the textures of the leptoquark yukawa couplings that account for the lepton flavour isolation textures proposed in @xcite , or other viable data - driven patterns for the leptoquark yukawa couplings .",

    ".      from the gut inspired model in section [ sec : gutmodel ] and eq.([barphi3_int ] ) , the following interaction terms between the familon fields and the quark currents are obtained @xmath209    as discussed in section [ sec : gutmodel ] , the breaking of the fs , eq .",
    "gives rise to a light familon ( see eq.([eq : familonmass ] ) ) that consists mostly in @xmath124 , and two heavy familons that consist dominantly of the fields @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the light familon eigenstate will therefore couple mostly to @xmath212 , with a small coupling to @xmath213 .",
    "moreover , in the quark mass basis we find the heaviest quark mass eigenstate to consist dominantly of @xmath214 , with small fractions of @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "these mixing effects imply that the off - diagonal interaction of the lightest familon mass eigenstate with the quark mass eigenstates has to be @xmath217 . in order to assess the effective familon - up - top coupling constant @xmath218",
    ", we assume that the masses of the lighter quark eigenstates and the quark mixings stem from the @xmath219 vevs of the other familons @xcite , which leads to the rough estimate of @xmath220 .",
    "we note , that this still allows for the sizeable cross - section for familon strahlung of order femtobarn , see fig .",

    "the familon - quark interactions therefore give rise to an excellent search channel at the lhc , namely the search for a resonance in the invariant mass of the decay products of the familon , for instance in a di - jet , that is associated with a single top .",
    "we try to estimate the prospects of detecting such a resonance by comparing event counts . during run",
    "i at the lhc , up to @xmath222 or @xmath223 signal events might have been produced , that consist in a single top plus a familon with @xmath151 gev and 1.0 tev , respectively .    in comparison ,",
    "the measured single top production cross section of @xmath224 pb ( cms @xcite and atlas @xcite ) , which is compatible with the sm prediction @xcite , yields a total event sample of @xmath225 events .",
    "since the statistical fluctuations of this number are of the same order of magnitude as the number of hypothetical signal events , it might be possible  with a systematic analysis of the kinematic distributions  to extract the resonance already from the present data .",
    "since the production cross sections increase at 13 tev , the chances of finding light familons are enhanced at run ii of the lhc , and also by its luminosity upgrade .",
    "family symmetries are well motivated through the possibility of explaining the observed patterns of fermionic masses and mixing , the so - called flavour problem of the standard model , and they can easily provide a connection to viable dark sectors in order generate the observed dark matter relic density through the familon portal .    in this paper",
    "we have studied three examples from the class of models with non - abelian family symmetries , with the dark sector consisting in fermions that are gauge singlets under the standard model gauge group , and transform non - trivially under the family symmetry , which gives rise to ( non - abelian ) familon portal interactions between the visible and the dark sector .",
    "we have shown that regions in the parameter space of those models exist that allow for matching the observed dark matter relic density , even without the fine - tuning of resonant annihilation , and for dark matter and familon masses on the experimentally accessible electroweak scale , with the uv cutoff above @xmath2 10 tev .",
    "in particular , the grand unification inspired model allows for masses of familon fields and dark matter candidate as small as @xmath192 gev , the model with familon - charged - lepton interactions requires dark matter masses above 100 gev and the model with familon - neutrino interactions allows for masses of @xmath226 gev , such that the observed abundance can be matched . on the other hand , dark matter masses beyond a few tev lead to overabundant dark matter for the models considered here , unless the fine - tuned case of a resonant annihilation cross section is considered .    concerning collider phenomenology at the lhc",
    ", we have investigated interesting signatures , such as flavour violation in fermionic final states , additional di - higgs events and single tops , which allow to directly test the effective coupling between the familon fields and the quarks . in the case of the familon fields coupling exclusively to the lepton sector ,",
    "it is possible to test lepton flavour violating leptonic final states at future lepton colliders , along with differences in the tri - linear higgs coupling or its decay width .",
    "it is also possibile to test the low - energy effects from the uv complete models with a non - abelian family symmetry , such as charged lepton flavour violating decays and the violation of lepton universality in meson decays .",
    "an intriguing possibility is given by the combination of the constraints on the mass and coupling parameters from section [ sec : dmstudy ] , which amounts to a light familon field with potentially flavour violating couplings to the fermions , with the results from collider phenomenology from section [ sec : colliderpheno ] , which enhances the predictivity of the respective model .",
    "we have shown that the potential of causing flavour violating signals at the lhc or at a future lepton collider is compatible with the constraints on the dark sector , and it is already subject to constraints from the collider experiments and precision experiments such as meg .",
    "in particular we find that , on the one hand , the bounds from the colliders effectively push the familon vacuum expectation values of the effective models to higher values , in order to accomodate the non - observation of the considered familon - induced excesses in collider data . on the other hand , the fact that the effective parameters are subject to constraints tells us , that we can expect to start seeing excesses that might hint at familons , provided the effective couplings are order one and the flavour - symmetry - breaking scale is not too far above the electroweak scale .    since the family symmetries are introduced to explain the observed pattern of masses and mixings of the standard model fermions , they tend to lead to similar predictions with respect to flavour observables",
    ". it would be interesting to see , whether the phenomenology investigated here allows to distinguish between the two classes of family symmetry given by the abelian and the non - abelian case .",
