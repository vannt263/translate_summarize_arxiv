    "the @xmath9-ray source groj0422 + 32 was first discovered by the burst and transient source experiments ( batse ; fishman et al . 1989 ) onboard the compton observatory on august 5th 1992 ( paciesas et al . 1992 ) .",
    "early batse results ( harmon et al 1992 , 1994 ) reported by the msfc pi team showed that the source underwent a major outburst when the hard x - ray ( 40 - 230 kev ) flux reached a level of @xmath10 crab in about three days .",
    "it remained at this level for approximately three days and then decreased exponentially with a time constant of 43.6 days ( vikhlinin et al . 1995 ) . a secondary maximum was then observed approximately 120 days after the first maximum , in december 1992 ( harmon et al .",
    "1994 ) , again followed by an exponential decay with time scale similar to that of the first maximum .",

    "the distance of the source was estimated by shrader et al ( 1994 ) to be @xmath21 kpc .",

    "it is interesting to note that the sigma spectrum ( roques et al .",
    "1994 ) shows excess flux from 400 to 600 kev above the best - fit comptonized model , and that high - energy flux was also observed from 1 - 2 mev by comptel ( van dijk et al .",
    "1995 ) . the composite spectral shape , comptonized below and power - law above 400 kev respectively ( see ling et al . 2000 ; figure 3 panels 36 - 39 ) strongly resembles the standard - state ( @xmath28 , or x - ray low / hard - state ) spectrum of cygnus x-1 ( ling et al.1987 , 1997 ; mcconnell et al .",

    "2000 ) have advanced our understanding of the system , information concerning the long - term behavior of the source during the outburst , however , is far from complete . the earlier batse published lightcurve ( paciesas et al . 1992 ; harmon et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ) primarily focused on the energy region below 200 kev .",
    "the spectra measured by comptel , osse and sigma focused on only isolated periods of the 200-day event due in part to the relatively spotty coverage of pointed observations made by most of these experiments .",
    "questions that need to be addressed include ( 1 ) how does the source spectrum evolve over the course of the event , and ( 2 ) what is the long - term behavior of the high - energy flux above 200 kev compared to that below 200 kev ( harmon et al .",
    "1994 ; grove et al .",
    "1998 ) ? answers to these questions will shed further light on the mechanism driving the outburst , and ultimately the physical makeup of the system itself .",
    "this paper addresses these important questions .",
    "our results were obtained using batse earth occultation data provided by the batse pi team at msfc ( fishman et al .",
    "1989 ) , processed and analyzed using the jpl enhanced batse occultation package ( ebop ; ling et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "a brief description of the ebop database and technique are given in section 2 .",
    "results produced by ebop are presented in section 3 .",
    "the batse earth occultation data were obtained by its eight large area nai scintillator detectors ( lads ) , each 50.8 cm diameter and 1.25 cm thick ( @xmath29 @xmath30 geometrical area ) operating in the energy range 0.02 - 1.8 mev ( fishman et al .",
    "these eight lads were placed at the eight corners of the spacecraft and provided nearly isotropic response to @xmath31 of the sky that not occulted by the earth . they were therefore ideally suited for unprecedented sensitive long - term continuous monitoring of gamma - ray sources , using the earth occultation technique ( harmon et al .",
    "1992 , 2002 ; ling et al",
    "the batse earth occultation data provided by the msfc pi team consisted of continuous ( cont ) data in 16 energy - channels with 2.048-s resolution for each lad .",
    "these 2.048-s resolution data were summed to 16.384-s resolution bins at jpl , and used as input to the ebop analysis system ( ling et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) . due to uncertainties of the energy edges of the first and the last energy channels",
    ", we analyzed only the central 14 channels here .",
    "the 5274 16-s data bins in each day typically yielded @xmath32 valid bins after losses and gaps .",
    "the heart of the ebop system fitted these @xmath32 measured count - rates ( per day , per energy channel , and per lad ) to a linear model in @xmath445 - 75 unknown terms that typically included contributions from 10 - 40 point sources ( of a total of 64 sources in the ebop input catalog ) and @xmath33 physical background terms . since the source flux in each of the 14 energy bins , and for each lad , was independently determined daily over a very distinct and highly variable background for the different lads , a strength of the batse experiment and the ebop system is the consistency check they provide on the source fluxes measured by the different lads daily and over the 10 - 14 day viewing periods as shown in section 3 ( see also wallyn et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the flux histories , with 1-day resolution , in the 35 - 100 kev , 100 - 200 kev , 200 - 300 kev , 300 - 400 kev , 400 - 700 kev , and 700 - 1000 kev energy bands , respectively , covering the period from 27 june 1992 ( tjd 8800 ) to 23 april 1993 ( tjd 9100 ) .",
    "highlights of these results include :    \\a .",
    "the 35 - 200 kev flux rose sharply after the onset of the outburst on 5 august 1992 ( tjd 8839 , labeled `` 1 '' ) , and reached the first of two maxima during the peak of the outburst on 14 august ( tjd 8848 , vertical dashed line `` b '' ) .",
    "it then decreased slightly ( @xmath2% for 35 - 100 kev , and @xmath34% for 100 - 200 kev ) over the next few days before rising again to a second maximum on 21 august ( tjd 8855 , vertical dashed line `` c '' ) .",
    "the declining phase of the event took @xmath35 days .",
    "the combined 35 - 200 kev flux reached half the peak level on @xmath4tjd 8877 , and a tenth of the peak on @xmath4tjd 8935 , approximately 80 days later .",
    "it continued to decrease to a level about 4% of the peak value on tjd 8960 before slowly rising again to the so - called `` secondary maximum '' on tjd 8972 ( @xmath5 days after the primary maximum on @xmath4tjd 8852 ) at a level about 15% of the peak value .",
    "the 35 - 200 kev flux stayed within 20% of the `` secondary maximum '' for @xmath7 days before declining , and finally reached the `` pre - outburst '' quiescent level on tjd 9040 .",
    "we observed also for the first time energy - dependent flux variability above 200 kev ( see figure 1 panels 3 - 6 ) .",
    "these data show temporal features significantly different than those observed below 200 kev .",
    "first , the high - energy flux rose more promptly after the onset and reached the 1st of four local maxima on tjd 8843 ( vertical dashed line `` a '' ) , 5 days before the 1st maximum of the 35 - 200 kev flux ( vertical dashed line `` b '' ) .",
    "it then declined in the next nine days before rising to a second maximum on 28 august ( tjd 8862 ; vertical dashed line in panel `` d '' ) , 7 days after the second maximum ( vertical dashed line in panel `` c '' ) and during the declining phase of the hard x - ray ( 35 - 200 kev ) flux .",
    "the flux ratio of the 2nd maximum to 1st maximum increased with energies , ranging from @xmath36 for 200 - 300 kev , 1.3 for 300 - 400 kev , @xmath8 for 400 - 700 kev to @xmath37 for 700 - 1000 kev .",
    "the local minimum around tjd 8850 became more pronounced with increasing energy .",
    "the flux ratio of this minimum to the 2nd maximum decreased from @xmath38 for 200 - 300 kev , @xmath39 for 300 - 400 kev , @xmath40 for 400 - 700 kev to @xmath41 for 700 - 1000 kev .",
    "variable high - energy fluxes were also consistently observed in the three high - energy channels ( 300 - 400 kev , 400 - 700 kev , and 700 - 1000 kev ) in at least two other periods centered at @xmath4tjd 8889 ( 3rd maximum , vertical dashed line `` e '' ) and tjd 8919 ( 4th maximum , vertical dashed line `` f '' ) , interspersed with periods of low gamma - ray flux at @xmath4tjd 8875 and tjd 8900 , respectively .",
    "spectra measured during these highly variable gamma - ray flux periods are presented in detail in the next section .",
    "the broad `` secondary maximum '' observed in 35 - 200 kev was also prominently observed in 200 - 300 kev at @xmath4tjd 8970 - 8981 , @xmath5 days after the primary peak , but became less pronounced at higher energies .",
    "there is also a dip in intensity at around tjds 8973 - 8977 in the midst of the `` secondary maximum '' , similar to that seen in the primary peak .",
    "such a dip is consistently seen in all six energy - bands .",
    "its significance is estimated to be @xmath42 at 200 - 300 kev .",
    "iyudin & haberl ( 2001 ) showed that the gamma - ray emission , based on 25 observations by comptel obtained between august 1992 and august 1997 ( @xmath43 days ) and three viewing periods before the 1992 outburst , is primarily confined between 1.5 and 2 mev , and was more prominent during phases from 0.0 to 0.5 of the 120d period , where zero phase corresponds to tjd 8840.5 .",
    "our batse results show that the high - energy fluxes were confined to phases from 0.0 to 0.7 of the same periodicity .",
    "the averaged flux of the 700 - 1000 kev emission integrated over tjd 8841 - 8923 ( phase @xmath40 - 0.7 ) is @xmath44 photons @xmath45-s@xmath46-kev@xmath46 compared to @xmath47 photons @xmath45-s@xmath46-kev@xmath46 integrated over tjd 8925 - 8960 ( @xmath4phase 0.7 - 1.0 ) .",
    "similarly for the 400 - 700 kev emission , the averaged fluxes for the same two periods are @xmath48 photons-@xmath45-s@xmath46-kev@xmath46 and @xmath49 photons-@xmath45-s@xmath46-kev@xmath46 , respectively .      the complex energy - dependent flux histories shown in figure 1 imply complex spectral changes over the course of the 200-day event .",
    "we selected a sample of thirty - six single - day spectra spanning the period from tjd 8839 to tjd 9033 to show such changes .",
    "pertinent information related to each of these spectra is given in both figure 2 and table 1 .",
    "for each day , the source was observed by two to four of the eight batse lads with good sensitivity .",
    "these `` source - viewing '' lads , which are identified in table 1 and figure 2 , were selected using the criterion discussed by ling et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "each lad spectrum has 14 energy bins .",
    "the solid line is the best - fit model ( either compton model or power - law ) to the @xmath50 data points , where @xmath50 = number of lads x 14 energy channels , using the standard analysis fitting program xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) . the best - fit model and parameters , as well as reduced @xmath51 ( @xmath51/@xmath52 , where @xmath52 is the number of degrees of freedom ) of the fit are also displayed in each panel and listed in table 1 . in twelve of the thirty - six panels (",
    "e.g. panels in the middle column in each of the four pages ) in figure 2 , spectra measured simultaneously by all `` source - viewing '' lads on that day are shown and compared .",
    "since each lad - spectrum was independently determined over a complex background that is totally different from that of the other seven lads , these simultaneously measured spectra allow one to assess the quality and consistency of the results .",
    "consistency of fluxes among all `` source - viewing '' lads is also reflected by the goodness of the model fits to the data ( ling et al .",
    "1996 ; ling et al .",
    "large reduced @xmath51 could be caused by either inconsistency of lad fluxes or inadequacy of the spectral model .",
    "twenty - nine of the 36 spectra shown in figure 1 have acceptable fits with either a power law or a compton model . the relatively large reduced @xmath53 shown in panels 13 - 21 ( @xmath4tjd 8855 - 8883 , taken around the 2nd maximum of the high - energy fluxes ) are due primarily to a spectral tail above 300 kev .",
    "in general the consistency among lads in the 36 spectra in figure 2 gives us good confidence in the analysis technique and results .",
    "having developed data analysis systems for four separate missions ( e.g. oso-7 , heao-1 , heao-3 , and cgro ) in the past three decades , and shared the frustration of many others of the disparate results produced by different experiments , some of which could be caused by systematic effects associated with the inadequacy of the data analysis techniques , we believe it is useful to show internal consistency achieved among the relevant detectors of a single instrument , such as batse .",
    "this was an important goal for ebop .",
    "we hope the results presented here will encourage other investigators to show internal consistency , as a necessary quality control requirement in future gamma - ray data analysis    key spectral results shown in figures 2 & 3 and table 1 are summarized as follows :      \\a . during the rising phase of the event , the single - day spectrum shown in figure 2a changed from a power - law with photon index of 1.75 on tjd 8839 ( figure 2a panel 1 ) to two days later , a shape better characterized by a single temperature analytic compton model ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) , with kt = 59@xmath54 kev and @xmath55 = 2.27@xmath56 , on tjd 8841 ( figure 2a - panel 2 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath51 for a power - law fit to the tjd 8841 spectrum is 2.9 compared to 0.66 for the compton model ( see table 1 ) , clearly indicating the change in spectral shape .",
    "in fact , the 4-day averaged spectra measured by the two `` source - viewing '' lads ( 1 @xmath57 5 ) during viewing - period 35 ( vp-35 tjd 8841 - 8844 ; see figure 3a - panel 1 ) show excesses of the high - energy ( @xmath0300 kev ) flux over the best - fit compton model ( solid line -kt = 51.1 kev , @xmath55 = 2.93 ) .",
    "the dashed line is the best - fit power law ( @xmath58 = 3.4 ) to the flux in the five high - energy channels ( 313 - 1700 kev ) measured by the two `` source - viewing '' lads ( 1 @xmath57 5 ) . such high - energy flux was only hinted in the corresponding single - day spectra ( figure 2a panels 2 - 5 ) due to statistical limitation of the data .",
    "the two - component ( compton + power law ) spectrum is strongly reminiscent of the @xmath28 spectrum ( or `` low / hard '' x - ray state ) of cygnus x-1 ( ling et al .",
    "1997 ; mcconnell et al .",
    "2000 ; ling 2001 ) , suggesting similar physical processes were at work in both systems .",
    "figure 2-a , b , c panels 6 - 25 and figure 3-a , b panels 2 - 8 show the single - day and multiple - day vp spectra , respectively , covering the period from tjd 8847 to 8925 .",
    "this period includes : ( 1 ) the peak and decay phases of the event when the 35 - 429 kev luminosity was above 20@xmath59 of the peak value ( see table 1 ) , and ( 2 ) periods of the 2nd ( vertical dashed line `` e '' ) and 3rd ( vertical dashed line `` f '' ) high - energy peaks described in section 3.1 . during this 78-day period , the spectrum underwent significant changes .",
    "for the low - energy comptonized component below 300 kev , as reflected by the best - fit parameters of the single - day spectrum shown in table 1 , the electron temperature ( kt ) varied from 40 to 60 kev and optical depth @xmath55 from 2.3 to 3.4 .",
    "for the high - energy power - law component above 300 kev , seen more prominently in the vp spectra shown in figure 3-a , b ( vps 36.7 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 and 42 ) , the best - fit photon index varied from @xmath36 in vp-42 , to @xmath60 in vp-39 .",
    "details shown in figure 3-a , b also include :    @xmath61 panel 2 shows the weighted averaged spectrum measured by four batse lads ( lads 0 , 2 4 & 6 ) during vp-36.5 ( tjd 8847 - 8853 ) , the 1st local high - energy flux minimum described in section 3.1-b ( see also figure 1 ) .",
    "the solid line is the best - fit compton model with kt = 42.2 kev and @xmath55 = 3.52 to the four `` source - viewing '' lad - spectra ( lads 0 , 2 , 4 , @xmath57 6 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath51 for the fit is 1.38 for 53 degrees of freedom . shown also in this panel is a comparison of the batse spectrum with those measured simultaneously by osse ( retrieved from the osse archive in 1995 ; see also ling et al .",
    "2000 ) and comptel ( van dijk et al .",
    "below 429 kev , osse fluxes were generally lower than those of batse by @xmath45 - 25@xmath59 .",
    "above 429 kev , upper limits measured by batse are consistent with the positive fluxes in the 518 - 678 kev bin measured by osse , and in the 750 - 1000 kev and 1000 - 2000 kev bins measured by comptel ( van dijk et al 1995 ) .",
    "the high - energy fluxes measured by comptel and osse in this period were lower than those measured by batse in vp-35 ( e.g.by approximately a factor of two at 1 mev .",
    "they provide , however , an important confirmation of the high - energy component of the two - component ( compton and power law ) spectrum observed by batse in vp-35 , and further suggest that such component is variable .",
    "@xmath61 the high - energy component @xmath0300 kev was also clearly visible in the four vp spectra that follow ( figure 3-a , b - panels 3 - 6 : vp-37 , 38 , 39 and 40 ) covering the period from tjd 8855 to tjd 8902 .",
    "the power - law indices for these four spectra vary from 2.7 to 3.8 .",
    "the two larger indices of 3.44 and 3.89 for vp-37 and vp-39 , respectively , correspond to the 1st ( between `` a '' and `` d '' ) and 2nd ( between `` d '' and `` e '' ) minimun of the high - energy flux shown in figure 1 panels 5 & 6 .",
    "none of these vp spectra can be adequately fitted with a single - component compton model ( solid line ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath51 for fitting these spectra varies from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the reasons for the poor fit are : ( 1 ) the presence of the high - energy flux above 300 kev in the spectrum , and ( 2 ) short - term ( single - day ) spectral changes shown in figure 2 , due possibly to intrinsic changes in the system , preclude any possibility for a simple model ( e.g. compton model ) to adequately fit the long - term vp spectrum . for three of the four vp spectra ( vp-37 , 38 and 40 ) in which high - energy fluxes are prominently visible , data measured by all `` source - viewing '' lads were display for demonstrating their consistency .",
    "the dashed line in each panel represents the best - fit power law to the fluxes measured by all `` source - viewing '' lads in the five high - energy channels ( 313 - 1700 kev ) .",
    "differences in spectral indices among the vp spectra reflect variability in the high - energy fluxes observed during this period .",
    "a relatively hard high - energy component was seen in the vp-38 and vp-40 spectra with indices of 2.65 and 2.87 , respectively .",
    "they correspond to the 2nd and 3rd sub - maxima shown in panels 5 @xmath57 6 in figure 1 . included in figure 3-a ,",
    "b panels 3 @xmath57 5 are also simultaneous osse vp-37 and vp-39 spectra , respectively , extracted from the osse unpublished archive in 1995 ( ling et al .",
    "again , the osse fluxes are systematically lower than those of batse below 500 kev by few to 26@xmath59 in vp-39 , and 25 - 47@xmath59 in vp-37 .",
    "more significantly , the weighted averaged vp-37 fluxes in energy bins of 766 - 1104 kev and 1104 - 1700 kev of ( 3.35 @xmath12 1.82 ) @xmath64 10@xmath65 and ( 1.52",

    "the reason for the discrepancy is not known at this time . since individual osse vp spectrum has not been published in open literature , such discrepancyare therefore not formally confirmed . finally , no high - energy flux was observed invp-41 , which corresponds to the 3rd minimum ( between `` e '' and `` f '' ) shown in figure 1 panel 5 @xmath57 6 .",
    "@xmath61 the hardest high - energy component was seen in the vp-42 spectrum with a power - law index of @xmath36 .",
    "positive fluxes were measured in each of the five high - energy channels ( 313 - 429 kev , 429 - 595 kev , 595 - 766 kev , 766 - 1104 kev and 1104 - 1700 kev ) at 13.8 , 7.9 , 6.2 , 5.7 , and 6.7@xmath67 significance , respectively .",

    "1987 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows a comparison of spectra measured simultaneously by batse and sigma ( roques et al 1994 ) during the period from tjd 8850 to tjd 8891 . above 300 kev ,",
    "batse results were consistent with those of sigma .",
    "below 300 kev , sigma results were generally lower by @xmath71 at 50 kev , @xmath72 at 100 kev and @xmath73 at 200 kev .",
    "since the source fluxes were highly variable during this 40-day period , part of the discrepancy below 300 kev may be due to differences in weighting the short - term daily fluxes in deriving the averaged spectrum .",
    "when the 35 - 500 kev luminosity dropped below to 20@xmath59 of the peak value observed on tjd 8848 ( see table 1 ) after tjd 8925 , the source spectrum returned to a power law with indices of @xmath74 - 2 ( see figure 2 panels 28 - 36 ) , similar to that first seen at the start of the event on tjd 8839 .",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison of a 30-day averaged low - state spectrum observed on tjd 9010 - 9040 with the average high - state spectrum covering the six periods shown in figure 3 from tjd 8841 to tjd 8865 ( vps 35 - 38 ) .",
    "the two spectra are clearly distinct . above 300 kev ,",
    "the low - state spectrum with a power index of @xmath8 is harder than that of the high - state spectrum with index of @xmath75 , and intersects the latter at @xmath76 kev .",
    "similar spectral features and characteristic were also observed in cygnus x-1 between the x - ray low - state and high - state spectra ( mcconnell et al .",
    "a comprehensive study of the long - term spectral and temporal properties of soft gamma - ray emission of groj0422 + 32 shown in the 1992 outburst is the primary subject of this report .",
    "highlights of our results are as follows :    @xmath61 the light curves in the six energy bands ( figure 1 ) show that the high - energy ( @xmath0200kev ) flux led the low - energy flux ( @xmath1200 kev ) by @xmath2 days in reaching the initial peak , but lagged the latter by @xmath3 days before starting to decline .",
    "@xmath61 we confirm the secondary maximum in the low - energy ( @xmath1200 kev ) flux at @xmath4tjd 8970 - 8981 , @xmath5 days after the first maximum , as reported earlier by the batse team ( harmon et al . 1993 ) .",
    "such a secondary maximum was also prominently observed in the 200 - 300 kev band , but became less pronounced at higher energies ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we also observed a dip in intensity in all six energy - bands at @xmath4tjds 8973 - 8977 in the midst of the secondary maximum .",
    "the dip is similar to that seen during the primary peak @xmath5 days earlier .",
    "@xmath61 during this 200-day period , the spectrum evolved from the low intensity power - law shape with photon index of 1.75 on tjd 8839 , to a high - intensity shape of two components : a themal - comptonization shape below 300 kev , with a power - law tail above 300 kev with variable index from @xmath36 to @xmath77 ( figures 2 @xmath57 3 ) .",
    "@xmath61 the spectrum remained roughly in this two - component shape until @xmath6 november ( tjd 8935 ) when the 35 - 429 kev luminosity dropped to @xmath71 of its peak value observed on tjd-8848 . at that time , the spectrum returned to the initial power - law shape with an index of @xmath8 and stayed in this shape until the end of the event ( figures 2 @xmath57 3 ; table 1 ) .",
    "@xmath61 strong episodes of high - energy ( 400 - 1000 kev ) emission were observed on four separate occasions during the first 84 days of the event ( figure 1 panels 5 - 6 ) .",
    "this corresponds to 0 - 0.70 phase of the 120-day period , which was first suggested by iyudin @xmath57 haberl ( 2001 ) based on several yeas of comptel observations .",
    "comptel results showed that the 1.5 - 2 mev emission was primarily confined to 0 - 0.5 phase of the 120-day period    @xmath61 the averaged high - intensity spectrum above 300 kev obtained on tjd 8841 - 8865 is softer than the average low - intensity power - law spectrum ( tjd 9010 - 9040 ) , and intercepts the latter at @xmath76 kev ( figure 5 ) .",
    "@xmath61 several key features displayed by groj0422 + 32 spectra are remarkably similar to those seen in cygnus x-1suggesting that similar processes may be at work in both systems .",
    "a direct comparison of these features is shown in table 2 :    the two - component compton plus power - law spectrum observed in groj0422 + 32 , cygnus x-1 and several other bh binaries has been the subject of several theoretical studies in recent years .",
    "earlier works in interpreting the cygnus x-1 spectra below @xmath36 mev in terms of a two - region core / corona thermal model ( ling et al .",
    "1997 ; skibo & dermer1994 ) using the monte carlo approach , have had some degree of success .",
    "however , we have now seen persistent power - law emission extended to @xmath36 mev in both the high and low - intensity @xmath9-ray state spectra of groj0422 + 32 as shown in this and other papers ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ; van dijk et al . 1995 ; iyudin & habert , 2001 ) , and in the @xmath78 ( high / soft ) and @xmath79 ( low / hard ) spectra of cygnus x-1 ( ling et al . 1997 ; mcconnell et al . 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the high - energy power - law component can not be adequately interpreted in terms of pure thermal processes alone , and that non - thermal processes must be also at work in these systems .",
    "power - law spectral tail may be associated with dynamical comptonization processes in converging flows onto a black hole ( laurent & titarchuk 1999 ; turolla et al .",
    "turolla et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that a power - law photon index of @xmath13 can be produced by up - scattering of primary photons off in - falling electrons .",
    "however , no direct comparison between theoretical predictions and observational data can be obtained at this time .",
    "non - thermal gamma - ray emission may be also associated with jets , which was discussed by meier ( 2001 ) as a natural consequence of accretion flows onto rotating black holes .",
    "a relativistic jet in cygnus x-1 has been observed in the radio band ( stirling et al .",
    "1996 ; fender et al .",
    "2000 ; fender 2001 ) when the source was in the @xmath79 ( low / hard ) state . radio emission was also seen in groj0422 + 32 ( shrader et al .",
    "1994 ) , although no jet - like structure was resolved from these observations .",
    "a more general approach using a hybrid thermal / non - thermal comptonization model ( eqpair ) was proposed by coppi ( 1998 ) ( see also gierlinski et al . , 1999 ) . in this model ,",
    "the electron distribution consists of a maxwellian component with a temperature , kt , plus a non - thermal power - law component .",
    "the acceleration of non - thermal electrons is independently taking place but is coupled to the background thermal plasma by compton scattering and coulomb collision processes .",
    "the model basically allows for both thermal and nonthermal comptonization of soft photons , as well as pair production , compton reflection , and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "although we do not know with certainty at the present the processes for producing the non - thermal power - law @xmath9-ray emission ( e.g. jets or other processes ) , our data suggest that non - thermal power law emission was present throughout the outburst .",
    "it was fully visible in the 35 kev to 1 mev energy band when the groj0422 + 32 was in the low - intensity state , and only partially visible in the 313 - 1 mev band when it was in the high - intensity state .",
    "furthermore , the average spectral index for the former was harder ( @xmath8 ) than the latter ( @xmath10 - 5 ) .",
    "we suggest a possible scenario for interpreting the observed data that includes a separate non - thermal ( perhaps a jet - like ) source region in the adaf model of esin et al ( 1998 ) along with the source geometry envisioned by poutanen & coppi ( 1998 ) and others ( coppi 1998 ; fender & kuulkers 2001 ; zdziarski 2002 ) ( see figure 6 ) . in this scenario , during the high - intensity state ( or @xmath79 state for cygnus x-1 ; figure 6 right panel ) , the system consists of a hot inner corona , a cooler outer thin disk , and a region that produced the variable power - law @xmath9-ray emission . under this condition ,",
    "the transition radius of the disk is @xmath80 schwarzschild radii from the black hole .",
    "electrons in the hot corona up - scattered the low - energy photons produced both inside the corona as well as from the outer disk to form the comptonized component that dominates the spectrum in the 35 - 300 kev range . they also down - scattered the high energy photons ( @xmath010 mev ) produced in the `` jet '' region resulted in forming a softer power - law component observed in the 300 kev to 1 mev range compared to that observed in the low - intensity spectrum .",
    "when the source was in the low - intensity soft @xmath9-ray state ( or @xmath78 state for cygnus x-1 ) due probably to a significantly increase of the accretion rate , a large soft flux was produced in the disk that effectively quench and cool the inner corona , and moved the transition radius inward to a distance very close to the horizon ( figure 6 left panel ) . under this condition , the comptonized component in the 35 - 300 kev range diminishes , and the source spectrum",
    "is dominated by the unperturbed power - law emission produced in the `` jet''-like non - thermal source region with a characteristic index of @xmath8 .",
    "while the above scenario helps to interpret some aspects of the new observational features , there are several issues that are not yet resolved : ( 1 ) what is the cause for the time - lag effect of @xmath4few days seen between the low ( @xmath1200 kev ) and high - energy ( @xmath0200 kev ) photons ? is this an indication of the response time for the comptonization process in the system to a sudden change of the accretion rate ? ( 2 ) the hard high - energy ( 0.3 - 1 mev ) spectral component observed in vp-42 with an index of @xmath36 is strongly reminiscent of the `` mev bump '' seen in the @xmath70 spectrum of cygnus x-1 ( ling et al .",
    "is this caused by a intrinsic change in the non - thermal emission , or is it a signature of the pair plasma ( liang and dermer 1988 ; ling @xmath57 wheaton 1989 ; poutanen @xmath57 coppi , 1998 ) produced by the heating the corona to very high temperature ( @xmath81 k ) .",
    "such heating could be caused by a further reduction of the accretion rate that led to the reduction of soft photons for its cooling ? ( 3 ) the intensity of the radio emission was observed to track the gamma rays throughout the outburst for groj0422 + 32 ( shrader et al .",
    "1994 ) , but was only seen in the @xmath79 state ( and not the @xmath78 state ) of cygnus x-1 ( stirling et al . 1996 ; fender et al .",
    "2000 ; fender 2001 ) .",
    "what is the reason for this difference ?",
    "is it caused by a difference of the `` beaming '' effect in the two systems ?",
    "we hope these results will stimulate further theoretical and observational investigations in the future of this very unusual and exciting black - hole system discovered by batse .",
    "we wish to thank gerald fishman , alan harmon , mark finger and geoff pendleton of the batse team for their support of the batse earth occultation investigation effort at jpl through - out the years , dave meier and paolo coppi for their extremely useful comments on the interpretation of these data , and undergraduate students robert kern , zachary medin , and juan estrella for processing the data .",
