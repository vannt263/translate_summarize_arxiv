    "bidirectional ( two - way ) relaying has higher bandwidth efficiency compared to unidirectional relaying @xcite-@xcite , and it is also a more suitable option for applications where the end nodes intend to exchange information ( e.g. , in interactive applications ) .",
    "the amplify - and - forward ( af ) version of bidirectional relaying , often referred to as the _ analog network coding _",
    "@xcite , has recently been extensively studied @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider bidirectional analog network coding with fixed information rates , which is suitable for delay - sensitive applications , such as bidirectional interactive speech and/or video communication .",
    "fixed - rate communication systems are usually characterized by the capacity outage probability ( op ) , which is a relevant performance measure in quasi - static ( i.e. , slowly fading ) channels . in these systems ,",
    "each transmitted codeword is affected by only one channel realization .",
    "papers @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite focus on the op analysis of dual - hop bidirectional af systems",
    ". however , @xcite and @xcite assume that the end nodes and the relay transmit with fixed powers , although they have instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) available . in particular",
    ", for each channel realization , the relay needs csi to set the amplification gain factor , whereas the end nodes need csi to cancel out self - interference and to decode the desired codeword .",
    "the available csi in fixed - rate bidirectional relaying systems can be used for optimal power allocation at the end nodes and the relay .",
    "papers @xcite-@xcite develop power allocation schemes that optimize different system objectives ; @xcite minimizes the op of either one of the two traffic flows , @xcite proposes a power allocation that balances the individual outage probabilities of the two end nodes , @xcite maximizes the instantaneous sum rate of bidirectional af systems , and @xcite minimizes the total consumed energy such that the ops of both traffic flows are maintained below some predefined values .",
    "however , the power allocations in these papers are subject to _ short - term power _ constraints , which limits the codeword power in each channel realization .    on the other hand , it is also possible to adopt _ average ( long - term ) power _ constraints so as to limit the average power of all codewords over all channel realizations @xcite . for point - to - point channels ,",
    "such power adaptation is known as _ truncated channel inversion _ and has been introduced in @xcite . for unidirectional",

    "optimal power allocation has been shown to introduce significant performance improvement relative to constant power transmission @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the literature does not offer similar results for bidirectional relaying with long - term power constraints .    in this work ,",
    "we derive power control strategies for the relay in bidirectional dual - hop af relaying systems . for predefined constant rates in both directions ,",
    "the proposed power allocation achieves minimization of the system op assuming an average power constraint at the relay .",
    "the end nodes are assumed to be simple nodes , equipped with cheap power amplifiers , and therefore are unable to support the high peak - to - average power ratios at their output , required for channel inversion .",
    "thus , the end nodes transmit with fixed powers .",
    "the relay applies the proposed optimal power control strategy based on the already available knowledge of the channel coefficients of both links . intuitively , it is not necessary for the relay to transmit at its maximum available power in each transmission cycle , but to transmit with the minimum power required to avoid outages , or sometimes even be silent when outages are unavoidable , thus conserving power . in other words ,",
    "we allow outages to occur in cases of deep fades , but for the rest of the time we ensure successful transmissions at the predefined constant transmission rate .",
    "the considered bidirectional relaying system comprises two end - nodes ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and a half - duplex af relay @xmath2 .",

    "we assume that the @xmath15 channel is reciprocal to the @xmath7 channel , and the @xmath16 channel is reciprocal to the @xmath8 channel .",
    "we adopt the rayleigh block fading model , which means that the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constant for each transmission cycle , but change from one transmission cycle to the next . in each transmission cycle",
    ", the pair @xmath17 denotes the channel state , where both @xmath18 and @xmath19 follow an exponential probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the received signals at the end nodes and the relay are corrupted by additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we assume a two - phase transmission cycle consisting of the mutiple access phase and the broadcast phase . in two - phase relaying ,",
    "bidirectional communication can be realized only via the relayed link @xmath20 . in the first phase , @xmath21 and",
