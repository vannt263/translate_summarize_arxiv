    "information networks are ubiquitous in the real world with examples such as airline networks , publication networks , social and communication networks , and the world wide web .",
    "the size of these information networks ranges from hundreds of nodes to millions and billions of nodes .",
    "analyzing large information networks has been attracting increasing attention in both academia and industry .",
    "this paper studies the problem of embedding information networks into low - dimensional spaces , in which every vertex is represented as a low - dimensional vector .",
    "such a low - dimensional embedding is very useful in a variety of applications such as visualization  @xcite , node classification  @xcite , link prediction  @xcite , and recommendation  @xcite .",
    "various methods of graph embedding have been proposed in the machine learning literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they generally perform well on smaller networks .",
    "the problem becomes much more challenging when a real world information network is concerned , which typically contains millions of nodes and billions of edges .",
    "for example , the twitter followee - follower network contains 175 million active users and around twenty billion edges in 2012  @xcite .",
    "most existing graph embedding algorithms do not scale for networks of this size .",
    "for example , the time complexity of classical graph embedding algorithms such as mds  @xcite , isomap  @xcite , laplacian eigenmap  @xcite are at least quadratic to the number of vertices , which is too expensive for networks with millions of nodes .",
    "although a few very recent studies approach the embedding of large - scale networks , these methods either use an indirect approach that is not designed for networks ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) or lack a clear objective function tailored for network embedding ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . we anticipate that a new model with a carefully designed objective function that preserves properties of the graph and an efficient optimization technique should effectively find the embedding of millions of nodes .        in this paper ,",
    "we propose such a network embedding model called the  line , \" which is able to scale to very large , arbitrary types of networks : undirected , directed and/or weighted .",
    "the model optimizes an objective which preserves both the local and global network structures .",
    "naturally , the local structures are represented by the observed links in the networks , which capture the _ first - order _ proximity between the vertices .",
    "most existing graph embedding algorithms are designed to preserve this _ first - order _ proximity , e.g. , isomap  @xcite and laplacian eigenmap  @xcite , even if they do not scale .",
    "we observe that in a real - world network many ( if not the majority of ) legitimate links are actually not observed .",
    "in other words , the observed _ first - order _ proximity in the real world data is not sufficient for preserving the global network structures . as a complement",
    ", we explore the _ second - order _ proximity between the vertices , which is not determined through the observed tie strength but through the shared neighborhood structures of the vertices . the general notion of the _ second - order _",
    "proximity can be interpreted as nodes with shared neighbors being likely to be similar .",
    "such an intuition can be found in the theories of sociology and linguistics .",
    "for example , `` the degree of overlap of two people s friendship networks correlates with the strength of ties between them , '' in a social network  @xcite ; and `` you shall know a word by the company it keeps '' ( firth , j. r. 1957:11 ) in text corpora @xcite .",
    "indeed , people who share many common friends are likely to share the same interest and become friends , and words that are used together with many similar words are likely to have similar meanings .",
    "[ fig::motivation ] presents an illustrative example .",
    "as the weight of the edge between vertex 6 and 7 is large , i.e. , 6 and 7 have a high _ first - order _ proximity , they should be represented closely to each other in the embedded space . on the other hand , though there is no link between vertex 5 and 6 , they share many common neighbors , i.e. , they have a high _ second - order _ proximity and therefore should also be represented closely to each other .",
    "we expect that the consideration of the _ second - order _ proximity effectively complements the sparsity of the _ first - order _ proximity and better preserves the global structure of the network . in this paper , we will present carefully designed objectives that preserve the first - order and the second - order proximities .    even if a sound objective is found , optimizing it for a very large network is challenging .",
    "one approach that attracts attention in recent years is using the stochastic gradient descent for the optimization .",
    "however , we show that directly deploying the stochastic gradient descent is problematic for real world information networks .",
    "this is because in many networks , edges are weighted and the weights usually present a high variance .",
    "consider a word co - occurrence network , in which the weights ( co - occurrences ) of word pairs may range from one to hundreds of thousands .",
    "these weights of the edges will be multiplied into the gradients , resulting in the explosion of the gradients and thus compromise the performance . to address this , we propose a novel edge - sampling method , which improves both the effectiveness and efficiency of the inference .",
    "we sample the edges with the probabilities proportional to their weights , and then treat the sampled edges as binary edges for model updating . with this sampling process , the objective function remains the same and the weights of the edges no longer affect the gradients .",
    "the line is very general , which works well for directed or undirected , weighted or unweighted graphs .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the line with various real - world information networks , including language networks , social networks , and citation networks .",
    "the effectiveness of the learned embeddings is evaluated within multiple data mining tasks , including word analogy , text classification , and node classification .",
    "the results suggest that the line model outperforms other competitive baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency .",
    "it is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of nodes and billions of edges in a few hours on a single machine .    to summarize",
    ", we make the following contributions :    * we propose a novel network embedding model called the  line , \" which suits arbitrary types of information networks and easily scales to millions of nodes .",
    "it has a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the first - order and second - order proximities .",
    "* we propose an edge - sampling algorithm for optimizing the objective .",
    "the algorithm tackles the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient decent and improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the inference .",
    "* we conduct extensive experiments on real - world information networks .",

    "finally we conclude in section  [ sec::conclusion ] .",
    "our work is related to classical methods of graph embedding or dimension reduction in general , such as multidimensional scaling ( mds )  @xcite , isomap  @xcite , lle  @xcite and laplacian eigenmap  @xcite .",
    "these approaches typically first construct the affinity graph using the feature vectors of the data points , e.g. , the k - nearest neighbor graph of data , and then embed the affinity graph  @xcite into a low dimensional space .",
    "however , these algorithms usually rely on solving the leading eigenvectors of the affinity matrices , the complexity of which is at least quadratic to the number of nodes , making them inefficient to handle large - scale networks .    among the most recent literature",
    "is a technique called graph factorization  @xcite .",
    "it finds the low - dimensional embedding of a large graph through matrix factorization , which is optimized using stochastic gradient descent .",
    "this is possible because a graph can be represented as an affinity matrix .",
    "however , the objective of matrix factorization is not designed for networks , therefore does not necessarily preserve the global network structure .",
    "intuitively , graph factorization expects nodes with higher first - order proximity are represented closely .",
    "instead , the line model uses an objective that is particularly designed for networks , which preserves both the _ first - order _ and the _ second - order _ proximities .",
    "practically , the graph factorization method only applies to undirected graphs while the proposed model is applicable for both undirected and directed graphs .",
    "the most recent work related with ours is deepwalk  @xcite , which deploys a truncated random walk for social network embedding .",
    "although empirically effective , the deepwalk does not provide a clear objective that articulates what network properties are preserved . intuitively , deepwalk expects nodes with higher _ second - order _ proximity yield similar low - dimensional representations , while the line preserves both _ first - order _ and _ second - order _ proximities .",
    "deepwalk uses random walks to expand the neighborhood of a vertex , which is analogical to a depth - first search .",
    "we use a breadth - first search strategy , which is a more reasonable approach to the _ second - order _ proximity .",
    "practically , deepwalk only applies to unweighted networks , while our model is applicable for networks with both weighted and unweighted edges .    in section  [ sec::experiments ] , we empirically compare the proposed model with these methods using various real world networks .",
    "we formally define the problem of large - scale information network embedding using _ first - order _ and _ second - order _ proximities .",
    "we first define an information network as follows :    [ def::information_network ] * ( information network ) * _ an * information network * is defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of vertices , each representing a data object and @xmath2 is the set of edges between the vertices , each representing a relationship between two data objects .",
    "each edge @xmath3 is an ordered pair @xmath4 and is associated with a weight @xmath5 , which indicates the strength of the relation . if @xmath6 is undirected , we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; if @xmath6 is directed , we have @xmath9 and @xmath10 . _    in practice , information networks can be either directed ( e.g. , citation networks ) or undirected ( e.g. , social network of users in facebook ) .",
    "the weights of the edges can be either binary or take any real value .",
    "note that while negative edge weights are possible , in this study we only consider non - negative weights .",
    "for example , in citation networks and social networks , @xmath11 takes binary values ; in co - occurrence networks between different objects , @xmath11 can take any non - negative value .",
    "the weights of the edges in some networks may diverge as some objects co - occur many times while others may just co - occur a few times .",
    "embedding an information network into a low - dimensional space is useful in a variety of applications . to conduct the embedding ,",
    "the network structures must be preserved .",
    "the first intuition is that the local network structure , i.e. , the local pairwise proximity between the vertices , must be preserved .",
    "we define the local network structures as the _ first - order _ proximity between the vertices :    [ def::1st - proximity ] * ( first - order proximity ) * _ the * first - order * proximity in a network is the * local * pairwise proximity between two vertices . for each pair of vertices linked by an edge @xmath12 ,",
    "the weight on that edge , @xmath11 , indicates the first - order proximity between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if no edge is observed between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , their * first - order * proximity is 0 . _",
    "the _ first - order _ proximity usually implies the similarity of two nodes in a real - world network .",
    "for example , people who are friends with each other in a social network tend to share similar interests ; pages linking to each other in world wide web tend to talk about similar topics .",
    "because of this importance , many existing graph embedding algorithms such as isomap , lle , laplacian eigenmap , and graph factorization have the objective to preserve the _ first - order _ proximity .",
    "however , in a real world information network , the links observed are only a small proportion , with many others missing @xcite .",
    "a pair of nodes on a missing link has a zero _ first - order _ proximity , even though they are intrinsically very similar to each other .",
    "therefore , _ first - order _ proximity alone is not sufficient for preserving the network structures , and it is important to seek an alternative notion of proximity that addresses the problem of sparsity .",
    "a natural intuition is that vertices that share similar neighbors tend to be similar to each other .",
    "for example , in social networks , people who share similar friends tend to have similar interests and thus become friends ; in word co - occurrence networks , words that always co - occur with the same set of words tend to have similar meanings .",
    "we therefore define the _ second - order _ proximity , which complements the first - order proximity and preserves the network structure .",
    "[ def::2nd - proximity ] * ( second - order proximity ) * _ the * second - order * proximity between a pair of vertices @xmath12 in a network is the similarity between their neighborhood network structures .",
    "mathematically , let @xmath15 denote the first - order proximity of @xmath13 with all the other vertices , then the _ second - order _ proximity between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is determined by the similarity between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if no vertex is linked from / to both @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the * second - order * proximity between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is 0 .",
    "_    we investigate both _ first - order _ and _ second - order _",
    "proximity for network embedding , which is defined as follows .",
    "[ def::line ] * ( large - scale information network embedding ) * _ given a large network @xmath0 , the problem of * large - scale information network embedding * aims to represent each vertex @xmath18 into a low - dimensional space @xmath19 , i.e. , learning a function @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . in the space @xmath19 ,",
    "both the * first - order * proximity and the * second - order * proximity between the vertices are preserved .",
    "_    next , we introduce a large - scale network embedding model that preserves both _",
    "first- _ and _ second - order _ proximities .",
    "a desirable embedding model for real world information networks must satisfy several requirements : first , it must be able to preserve both the _ first - order _ proximity and the _ second - order _ proximity between the vertices ; second , it must scale for very large networks , say millions of vertices and billions of edges ; third , it can deal with networks with arbitrary types of edges : directed , undirected and/or weighted . in this section",
    ", we present a novel network embedding model called the `` line , '' which satisfies all the three requirements .",
    "we describe the line model to preserve the _ first - order _ proximity and _ second - order _ proximity separately , and then introduce a simple way to combine the two proximity .      the _ first - order _ proximity refers to the local pairwise proximity between the vertices in the network . to model the _ first - order _ proximity , for each undirected edge @xmath22 , we define the joint probability between vertex @xmath23 and @xmath24 as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the low - dimensional vector representation of vertex @xmath23 .",

    "we choose to minimize the kl - divergence of two probability distributions . replacing @xmath32 with kl - divergence and omitting some constants",
    ", we have : @xmath33    note that the _ first - order _ proximity is only applicable for undirected graphs , not for directed graphs . by finding the @xmath34 that minimize the objective in eqn .",
    ", we can represent every vertex in the d - dimensional space .      the _ second - order _ proximity is applicable for both directed and undirected graphs . given a network , without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume it is directed ( an undirected edge can be considered as two directed edges with opposite directions and equal weights ) .",
    "the _ second - order _",
    "proximity assumes that vertices sharing many connections to other vertices are similar to each other . in this case , each vertex is also treated as a specific `` context '' and vertices with similar distributions over the `` contexts '' are assumed to be similar .",
    "therefore , each vertex plays two roles : the vertex itself and a specific `` context '' of other vertices .",
    "we introduce two vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath35 is the representation of @xmath23 when it is treated as a vertex while @xmath36 is the representation of @xmath23 when it is treated as a specific `` context '' . for each directed edge @xmath22",
    ", we first define the probability of `` context '' @xmath24 generated by vertex @xmath23 as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of vertices or `` contexts . '' for each vertex @xmath23 , eqn",
    ".   actually defines a conditional distribution @xmath39 over the contexts , i.e. , the entire set of vertices in the network . as mentioned above ,",
    "the _ second - order _",
    "proximity assumes that vertices with similar distributions over the contexts are similar to each other . to preserve the _ second - order _ proximity , we should make the conditional distribution of the contexts @xmath39 specified by the low - dimensional representation be close to the empirical distribution @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we minimize the following objective function : @xmath41 where @xmath32 is the distance between two distributions . as the importance of the vertices in the network may be different",
    ", we introduce @xmath42 in the objective function to represent the prestige of vertex @xmath43 in the network , which can be measured by the degree or estimated through algorithms such as pagerank  @xcite . the empirical distribution @xmath40 is defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the weight of the edge @xmath22 and @xmath46 is the out - degree of vertex @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the set of out - neighbors of @xmath23 . in this paper ,",
    "for simplicity we set @xmath42 as the degree of vertex @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath49 , and here we also adopt kl - divergence as the distance function .",
    "replacing @xmath32 with kl - divergence , setting @xmath49 and omitting some constants , we have :    @xmath50    by learning @xmath34 and @xmath51 that minimize this objective , we are able to represent every vertex @xmath52 with a d - dimensional vector @xmath35 .      to embed the networks by preserving both the _ first - order _ and _ second - order _ proximity , a simple and effective way we find in practice is to train the line model which preserves the _ first - order _ proximity and _ second - order _ proximity separately and then concatenate the embeddings trained by the two methods for each vertex . a more principled way to combine the two proximity is to jointly train the objective function and , which we leave as future work .",
    "optimizing objective is computationally expensive , which requires the summation over the entire set of vertices when calculating the conditional probability @xmath39 . to address this problem",
    ", we adopt the approach of negative sampling proposed in  @xcite , which samples multiple negative edges according to some noisy distribution for each edge @xmath22 .",
    "more specifically , it specifies the following objective function for each edge @xmath22 : @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the sigmoid function .",
    "the first term models the observed edges , the second term models the negative edges drawn from the noise distribution and @xmath55 is the number of negative edges .",
    "we set @xmath56 as proposed in  @xcite , where @xmath57 is the out - degree of vertex @xmath14 .",
    "for the objective function , there exists a trivial solution : @xmath58 , for i=@xmath59 and @xmath60 . to avoid the trivial solution",
    ", we can still utilize the negative sampling approach by just changing @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "we adopt the asynchronous stochastic gradient algorithm ( asgd )  @xcite for optimizing eqn .  .",
    "in each step , the asgd algorithm samples a mini - batch of edges and then updates the model parameters .",
    "if an edge @xmath22 is sampled , the gradient w.r.t .",
    "the embedding vector @xmath35 of vertex @xmath43 will be calculated as :    @xmath63    note that the gradient will be multiplied by the weight of the edge .",
    "this will become problematic when the weights of edges have a high variance .",
    "for example , in a word co - occurrence network , some words co - occur many times ( e.g. , tens of thousands ) while some words co - occur only a few times . in such networks ,",
    "the scales of the gradients diverge and it is very hard to find a good learning rate . if we select a large learning rate according to the edges with small weights , the gradients on edges with large weights will explode while the gradients will become too small if we select the learning rate according to the edges with large weights .",
    "the intuition in solving the above problem is that if the weights of all the edges are equal ( e.g. , network with binary edges ) , then there will be no problem of choosing an appropriate learning rate .",
    "a simple treatment is thus to unfold a weighted edge into multiple _",
    "binary _ edges , e.g. , an edge with weight @xmath64 is unfolded into @xmath64 _ binary _ edges .",
    "this will solve the problem but will significantly increase the memory requirement , especially when the weights of the edges are very large . to resolve this , one can sample from the original edges and treat the sampled edges as _ binary _ edges , with the sampling probabilities proportional to the original edge weights . with this edge - sampling treatment , the overall objective function remains the same .",
    "the problem boils down to how to sample the edges according to their weights .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the sequence of the weights of the edges .",
    "one can simply calculate the sum of the weights @xmath66 first , and then to sample a random value within the range of @xmath67 $ ] to see which interval [ @xmath68 the random value falls into .",
    "this approach takes @xmath69 time to draw a sample , which is costly when the number of edges @xmath70 is large .",
    "we use the alias table method  @xcite to draw a sample according to the weights of the edges , which takes only @xmath71 time when repeatedly drawing samples from the same discrete distribution .",
    "sampling an edge from the alias table takes constant time , @xmath71 , and optimization with negative sampling takes @xmath72 time , where @xmath55 is the number of negative samples .",
    "therefore , overall each step takes @xmath73 time . in practice , we find that the number of steps used for optimization is usually proportional to the number of edges @xmath69",
    ". therefore , the overall time complexity of the line is @xmath74 , which is linear to the number of edges @xmath70 , and does not depend on the number of vertices @xmath38 .",
    "the edge sampling treatment improves the effectiveness of the stochastic gradient descent without compromising the efficiency .",
    "we discuss several practical issues of the line model .",
    "* low degree vertices .",
    "* one practical issue is how to accurately embed vertices with small degrees .",
    "as the number of neighbors of such a node is very small , it is very hard to accurately infer its representation , especially with the _ second - order _ proximity based methods which heavily rely on the number of `` contexts . ''",
    "an intuitive solution to this is expanding the neighbors of those vertices by adding higher order neighbors , such as neighbors of neighbors . in this paper , we only consider adding second - order neighbors , i.e. , neighbors of neighbors , to each vertex . the weight between vertex @xmath43 and its second - order neighbor @xmath75 is measured as @xmath76 in practice , one can only add a subset of vertices @xmath77 which have the largest proximity @xmath45 with the low degree vertex @xmath43 .",

    ", a straightforward way is to minimize either one of the following objective functions @xmath79 by updating the embedding of the new vertex and keeping the embeddings of existing vertices .",

    "for instance , given a word pair (  china\",beijing \" ) and a word  france , \" the right answer should be `` paris '' because  beijing \" is the capital of  china \" just as `` paris '' is the capital of `` france . ''",
    "given the word embeddings , this task is solved by finding the word @xmath96 whose embedding is closest to the vector @xmath97 in terms of cosine proximity , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "two categories of word analogy are used in this task : semantic and syntactic .     + significantly outperforms gf at the : * * 0.01 and * 0.05 level , paired t - test .",
    "table  [ tab::word - analogy - wikipedia ] reports the results of word analogy using the embeddings of words learned on the wikipedia corpora ( skipgram ) or the wikipedia word network ( all other methods ) . for graph factorization ,",
    "the weight between each pair of words is defined as the logarithm of the number of co - occurrences , which leads to better performance than the original value of co - occurrences . for deepwalk ,",
    "different cutoff thresholds are tried to convert the language network into a binary network , and the best performance is achieved when all the edges are kept in the network .",
    "we also compare with the state - of - the - art word embedding model skipgram  @xcite , which learns the word embeddings directly from the original wikipedia pages and is also implicitly a matrix factorization approach  @xcite .",
    "the window size is set as 5 , the same as used for constructing the language network .",
    "we can see that line(2nd ) outperforms all other methods , including the graph embedding methods and the skipgram .",
    "this indicates that the _ second - order _ proximity better captures the word semantics compared to the _ first - order _ proximity .",
    "this is not surprising , as a high _ second - order _ proximity implies that two words can be replaced in the same context , which is a stronger indicator of similar semantics than first - order co - occurrences .",
    "it is intriguing that the line(2nd ) outperforms the state - of - the - art word embedding model trained on the original corpus .",
    "the reason may be that a language network better captures the global structure of word co - occurrences than the original word sequences . among other methods , both graph factorization and line(1st ) significantly outperform deepwalk even if deepwalk explores second - order proximity .",
    "this is because deepwalk has to ignore the weights ( i.e. , co - occurrences ) of the edges , which is very important in a language network .",
    "the performance by the line models directly optimized with sgd is much worse , because the weights of the edges in the language network diverge , which range from a single digit to tens of thousands , making the learning process suffer .",
    "the line optimized by the edge - sampling treatment effectively addresses this problem , and performs very well using either _ first - order _ or _ second - order _ proximity .",
    "all the models are run on a single machine with 1 t memory , 40 cpu cores at 2.0ghz using 16 threads .",
    "both the line(1st ) and line(2nd ) are quite efficient , which take less than 3 hours to process such a network with 2 million nodes and a billion edges .",
    "both are at least 10% faster than graph factorization , and much more efficient than deepwalk ( five times slower ) .",
    "the reason that line - sgds are slightly slower is that a threshold - cutting technique has to be applied to prevent the gradients from exploding .",

    "we choose a very simple approach , taking the average of the word vector representations in that document .",
    "this is because we aim to compare the word embeddings with different approaches instead of finding the best method for document embeddings .",
    "the readers can find advanced document embedding approaches in  @xcite .",

    "table  [ tab::doc - classification - wikipedia ] reports the results of wikipedia page classification .",
    "similar conclusion can be made as in the word analogy task .",
    "the graph factorization outperforms deepwalk as deepwalk ignores the weights of the edges .",
    "the line - sgds perform worse due to the divergence of the weights of the edges .",
    "the line optimized by the edge - sampling treatment performs much better than directly deploying sgd .",
    "the line(2nd ) outperforms line(1st ) and is slightly better than the graph factorization .",
    "note that with the supervised task , it is feasible to concatenate the embeddings learned with line(1st ) and line(2nd ) . as a result ,",
    "the line(1st+2nd ) method performs significantly better than all other methods .",
    "this indicates that the first - order and second - order proximities are complementary to each other .    to provide the readers more insight about the first - order and second - order proximities , table  [ tab::similar - words - wikipedia ]",
    "compares the most similar words to a given word using _ first - order _ and _ second - order _ proximity .",
    "we can see that by using the contextual proximity , the most similar words returned by the _ second - order _ proximity are all semantically related words .",

    "line(1st ) is slightly better than line(2nd ) , which is opposite to the results on the language network .",
    "the reasons are two fold : ( 1 ) _ first - order _ proximity is still more important than _ second - order _ proximity in social network , which indicates strong ties ; ( 2 ) when the network is too sparse and the average number of neighbors of a node is too small , the _ second - order _ proximity may become inaccurate .",

    "table  [ tab::vertex - classification - youtube ] reports the results on youtube network , which is extremely sparse and the average degree is as low as 5 . in most cases with different percentages of training data , line(1st ) outperforms line(2nd ) , consistent with the results on the flickr network . due to the extreme sparsity , the performance of line(2nd )",
    "is even inferior to deepwalk . by combining the representations learned by the line with both the _ first- _ and _ second - order _ proximity , the performance of line outperforms deepwalk with either 128 or 256 dimension , showing that the two proximities are complementary to each other and able to address the problem of network sparsity .",
    "it is interesting to observe how deepwalk tackles the network sparsity through truncated random walks , which enrich the neighbors or contexts of each vertex .",
    "the random walk approach acts like a depth - first search .",
    "such an approach may quickly alleviate the sparsity of the neighborhood of nodes by bringing in indirect neighbors , but it may also introduce nodes that are long range away . a more reasonable way is to expand the neighborhood of each vertex using a breadth - first search strategy , i.e. , recursively adding neighbors of neighbors . to verify this",
    ", we expand the neighborhood of the vertices whose degree are less than 1,000 by adding the neighbors of neighbors until the size of the extended neighborhood reaches 1,000 nodes .",
    "we find that adding more than 1,000 vertices does not further increase the performance .",
    "the results in the brackets in table  [ tab::vertex - classification - youtube ] are obtained on this reconstructed network .",
    "the performance of gf , line(1st ) and line(2nd ) all improves , especially line(2nd ) . in the reconstructed network , the line(2nd ) outperforms deepwalk in most cases .",
    "we can also see that the performance of line(1st+2nd ) on the reconstructed network does not improve too much compared with those on the original network .",
    "this implies that the combination of _ first - order _ and _ second - order _ proximity on the original network has already captured most information and line(1st+2nd ) approach is a quite effective and efficient way for network embedding , suitable for both dense and sparse networks .",
    "we present the results on two _ citation _ networks , both of which are directed networks .",
    "both the gf and line methods , which use _ first - order _ proximity , are not applicable for directed networks , and hence we only compare deepwalk and line(2nd ) .",
    "we also evaluate the vertex embeddings through a multi - label classification task .",
    "we choose 7 popular conferences including aaai , cikm , icml , kdd , nips , sigir , and www as the classification categories .",

    "the line model directly optimized by stochastic gradient descent , + line(2nd ) , does not perform well as expected .",

    "* table  [ tab::vertex - classification - dblppapercitation ] reports the results on the dblp(papercitation ) network .",
    "the line(2nd ) significantly outperforms deepwalk .",
    "this is because the random walk on the paper citation network can only reach papers along the citing path ( i.e. , older papers ) and can not reach other references .",
    "instead , the line(2nd ) represents each paper with its references , which is obviously more reasonable .",
    "the performance of line(2nd ) is further improved when the network is reconstructed by enriching the neighbors of vertices with small degrees ( smaller than 200 ) .",
    "an important application of network embedding is to create meaningful visualizations that layout a network on a two dimensional space .",
    "we visualize a co - author network extracted from the dblp data .",

    "laying out this co - author network is very challenging as the three research fields are very close to each other .",
    "we first map the co - author network into a low - dimensional space with different embedding approaches and then further map the low - dimensional vectors of the vertices to a 2-d space with the t - sne package  @xcite .",
    "[ fig::visualization - coauthor - network ] compares the visualization results with different embedding approaches .",
    "the visualization using graph factorization is not very meaningful , in which the authors belonging to the same communities are not clustered together .",
    "the result of deepwalk is much better .",
    "however , many authors belonging to different communities are clustered tightly into the center area , most of which are high degree vertices .",
    "this is because deepwalk uses a random walk based approach to enrich the neighbors of the vertices , which brings in a lot of noise due to the randomness , especially for vertices with higher degrees .",
    "the line(2nd ) performs quite well and generates meaningful layout of the network ( nodes with same colors are distributed closer ) .",

    "we can see that in the beginning , when the network is very sparse , the line(1st ) outperforms line(2nd ) .",
    "as we gradually increase the percentage of links , the line(2nd ) begins to outperform the line(1st ) .",
    "this shows that the _ second - order _ proximity suffers when the network is extremely sparse , and it outperforms _ first - order _ proximity when there are sufficient nodes in the neighborhood of a node .",

    "overall , the performance of different models increases when the degrees of the vertices increase . in the original network , the line(2nd ) outperforms line(1st ) except for the _ first _ group , which confirms that the _ second - order _ proximity does not work well for nodes with a low degree . in the reconstructed dense network , the performance of the line(1st ) or line(2nd ) improves , especially the line(2nd ) that preserves the _ second - order _ proximity .",
