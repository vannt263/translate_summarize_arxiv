    "because of the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , the energy of a plasmon propagating in an electron gas exceeds greatly the energy of an electron - hole excitation at the same wave vector @xmath6 , provided that @xmath6 is smaller than the fermi wave vector @xmath4 .",
    "this remains true in any dimensionality , including the case of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , for which the plasmon spectrum is gapless , @xmath7 here @xmath5 is the fermi velocity , @xmath8 is the inverse screening radius , @xmath9 is the effective electron mass , and @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of the host material .",

    "high plasmon velocity , @xmath12 , prevents plasmon from decaying into an electron - hole pair and makes the landau damping exponentially small at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the leading contribution to the plasmon attenuation of a purely electronic nature comes from the plasmon decay into two electron - hole pairs@xcite .",
    "two such pairs propagating in opposite directions can carry large energy while having a negligible total momentum .    in 2deg formed in semiconductor heterostructures",
    ", there are additional channels for plasmon attenuation .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation conditions can also be satisfied for processes in which a plasmon creates an electron - hole pair and a phonon , rather than two electron - hole pairs .",
    "we will call an attenuation due to such processes a _",
    "phonon - assisted landau damping _ since it involves a single electron - hole pair .",
    "the effectiveness of this process is increased by a large phase space for the emission of phonons in the bulk of a semiconductor .",
    "yet another possibility of the plasmon attenuation in a heterostructure arises from a conversion of the plasmon into an acoustic phonon via a virtual electron - hole pair .",
    "such a process is feasible due to the absence of momentum conservation in the direction perpendicular to the 2deg plane ( @xmath13-direction ) .",
    "this makes it possible to satisfy energy and in - plane momentum conservation conditions for a process in which a plasmon is converted into a phonon with appropriate value @xmath14 of the momentum along @xmath13-axis : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the sound velocity .",
    "note that processes involving optical phonons can be safely neglected as they have large energy thresholds ( typically @xmath17 mev ) .    in the present paper , we analyze the mentioned above inelastic processes leading to plasmon attenuation , and do not consider the effect of impurities , assuming 2deg sufficiently clean . in section",
    "ii the plasmon broadening due to plasmon - phonon conversion is discussed .",
    "the conversion is mediated by a virtual electron - hole pair with a rate independent of temperature . in subsequent sections we discuss scattering processes leading to the creation of real electron - hole pairs in the final state : in section iii the probability for plasmon scattering into a phonon and an electron - hole pair is derived . in section",

    "<S> in a ballistic two - dimensional electron gas , the landau damping does not lead to plasmon attenuation in a broad interval of wave vectors @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it does not contribute to the optical conductivity @xmath1 in a wide domain of its arguments , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the fermi energy , wavevector and velocity of the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we identify processes that result in the plasmon attenuation in the absence of landau damping . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are : the excitation of two electron - hole pairs , phonon - assisted excitation of one pair , and a direct plasmon - phonon conversion . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the corresponding contributions to the plasmon linewidth and to the optical conductivity . </S>"
