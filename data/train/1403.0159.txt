    "probably the most significant result of the gromov analysis of classical networks  @xcite is existence of a congestion core . under a network protocol that sends the packets along least cost paths",
    ", the _ core _ can be qualitatively defined as a point where most of the geodesics ( least cost paths ) converge , creating packet drops , high retransmission rates , and other nuisances under the tcp - ip protocol  @xcite .",
    "existence of the core has been experimentally observed  @xcite and mathematically proved  @xcite if the network is gromov hyperbolic , subject to some highly technical conditions related to the gromov boundary  @xcite .",
    "a gromov hyperbolic network can intuitively be defined as a network that `` looks like '' a negatively curved riemannian manifold ( e.g. , a saddle ) when viewed from a distance .",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a precise definition .",
    "next to classical networks , one can envision quantum networks : the nodes are spins that can be up @xmath4 ( not excited ) or down @xmath5 ( excited ) and the links are quantum mechanical couplings of the xx or heisenberg type . given some random source - destination pair @xmath6 , a valid question is whether some spin @xmath7 could act as a `` core , '' that is , a spin that could be excited no matter what the source and the destination are . for a linear chain , one would expect such a congestion core in the center as classically any excitation in one half of the chain would have to transit the center of the chain to reach the other half . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that quantum - mechanically the transmission of excitations does not need to occur this way , and in fact the center @xmath7 of an odd - length spin chain can act as an `` anti - core , '' excitation of which is avoided .    this  anti - core , \" or `` anti - gravity '' center as it was originally called , was first observed in  @xcite . the anti",
    "- core @xmath7 was defined as a point of high inertia , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , as opposed to the classical congestion core that has minimum inertia owing to the negative curvature of the underlying space  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2.1 ) .",
    "the inertia quantifies how difficult communication to and from the anti - core is .    as it has been done along this line of work , a pre - metric @xmath10 based on the _ information transfer capacity ( itc ) _ ( see sec .  [",
    "s : homogeneous ] ) is employed .",
    "unlike standard quantum mechanical distances  @xcite ,  @xcite , this  distance \" measure aims to quantify not how distant two fixed quantum states are , but how close to a desired target state a quantum state can get under the evolution of a particular hamiltonian .",
    "the initial and target states are typically orthogonal .    in this paper , we provide an _ analytical _ justification of the numerically observed anti - core phenomenon in spin chains with xx coupling , starting with finite - length chains , extending the itc concept to semi- and bi - infinite cases ( sec .",
    "[ s : infinite_chains ] ) , and finally _ proving _ that @xmath11 , @xmath12 in sec .",
    "[ s : anti_core ] .",
    "we further show that by adding a bias on the central spin its _ `` anti - core '' _ property can be made stronger in the sense that the probability of transmission of the excitation to and from it is infinitesimally small ( sec .",
    "[ s : engineered ] ) .",
    "the remaining nagging question is why was it observed in  @xcite that spin chains appear gromov - hyperbolic and have an anti - core , while classical networks are gromov hyperbolic with the opposite core ?",
    "this will be clarified in sec .",
    "[ s : engineered ] by means of a spin chain example , showing that its gromov boundary has _ only one _ point , while classical networks need to have _ at least two points _ in their gromov boundary for the core to emerge .",
    "we consider a linear array of two - level systems ( spin @xmath13 particles ) with uniform coupling between adjacent spins ( homogeneous spin chain ) made up of an odd number @xmath14 of physically equally spaced spins with coupling hamiltonian @xmath15 here we shall be primarily interested in the case of xx coupling , for which @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is the pauli matrix along the @xmath18 or @xmath19 direction of spin @xmath1 in the array , i.e. , @xmath20 where the factor @xmath21 occupies the @xmath1th position among the @xmath14 factors and @xmath21 is one of the single spin pauli operators @xmath22 it is easily seen that @xmath23 is _ real _ and symmetric .",
    "the @xmath24 hamiltonian commutes with the operator @xmath25 which counts the total number of excitations .",
    "the hilbert space can therefore be decomposed into subspaces corresponding to the number of excitations .",
    "define @xmath26 to be the quantum state in which the excitation is on spin @xmath1 .",
    "the single excitation subspace @xmath27 is spanned by @xmath28 .",
    "restricted to this subspace , the hamiltonian in this natural basis takes the form @xmath29 for xx coupling ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath30 becomes the @xmath31 toeplitz matrix @xmath32 made up of zeros on the diagonal , ones on the super- and subdiagonal and zeros everywhere else .",

    "however , because of the symmetry of formula  , both subsequences yield the same result : @xmath86          from table  [ t : in_terms_of ] , we could let @xmath33 along the even number subsequence of @xmath76 , in which case we need to take @xmath82 and @xmath78 .",

    "since the general formula   is in terms of function @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 that depend on whether @xmath74 and @xmath75 are even or odd ( see section  [ s : consistency ] ) , it is necessary to examine each case in particular . from section  [ s : consistency ]",

    "we start with the easy case where in this case indeed , both @xmath109 is even .",
