    "although the process of phase conversion of hot hadronic matter that presumably happens in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments is often compared to the cosmological quark - hadron transition in the early universe , the relevant space - time scales differ by almost twenty orders of magnitude .",
    "in particular , while one would need temperatures @xmath0gev to be subject to appreciable finite - size effects in the case of the early universe , which of course spares the primordial quark - hadron transition from these effects , this is not the case for the quark - gluon plasma formed in hics @xcite . therefore ,",
    "in the context of hics , descriptions of an equilibrium quark - gluon plasma in the thermodynamic limit are , in principle , missing non - negligible finite - size corrections .    strictly speaking , from the statistical mechanics standpoint",
    ", there is no phase transition in a system of finite size , and no criticality can be defined .",
    "singularities that would play the role of strong lighthouses in the search for criticality are rounded and become smooth . actually , the originally critical quantities are also shifted in the @xmath1 plane according to volume variations , becoming _",
    ", with some unavoidable ambiguity in their definition .",
    "this is the actual scenario in any experiment in hics .",
    "in addition , the time scale involved in the collision process is also not large compared to the microscopic time scale to achieve equilibrium .",
    "therefore , thermodynamic quantities directly inferred from data assuming an infinite system in equilibrium should _ not _ correspond to its true and unique value in the thermodynamic limit . moreover , even neglecting dynamical non - equilibrium effects , all signatures of the second - order critical endpoint based on non - monotonic behaviour @xcite ( or sign modifications @xcite ) of particle correlation fluctuations",
    "will probe a _",
    "pseudocritical endpoint _ , shifted significantly from the genuine critical endpoint by finite - size corrections and boundary effects .    in this paper",
    ", we do not address non - equilibrium effects , but argue that finite - size modifications will play a crucial role in the search for the critical endpoint in hics .",
    "on one hand , they restrict the access of the proposed particle correlation fluctuation signatures to ( volume- and boundary - condition - dependent ) pseudocritical quantities . on the other hand , the fact that the experimental data can be arranged as a set of systems of different sizes can actually help us extract information directly related to the thermodynamic limit of qcd , especially concerning its critical endpoint and the universality class of the transition .    first , we investigate finite - size effects on the phase diagram of strong interactions , presenting results for the modification of the pseudocritical line in the temperature - chemical potential phase diagram , as well as for isentropic trajectories . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ the linear sigma model coupled to quarks with two flavors , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this effective theory has been widely used to describe different aspects of the chiral transition , such as thermodynamic properties @xcite and the nonequilibrium phase conversion process @xcite , as well as combined to other models in order to include effects from confinement @xcite .",
    "we show that the volume - dependence of the qcd phase diagram in the regime of energy scales probed by current heavy ion experiments can be large .",
    "second , treating hic data separated into slices of different impact parameter width as a realization of a set of thermodynamical systems of different sizes and temperatures , we propose the use of full scaling plots of cumulants of fluctuations of pions as a tool for searching the critical endpoint of qcd and determining its universality class . from this point of view",
    ", hics could be seen as the `` experimental realization '' of lattice simulations for systems of different sizes . in this picture ,",
    "signatures of the second - order critical endpoint based on non - monotonic behaviour ( or sign modifications ) of particle correlation fluctuations will actually probe a _ set of pseudocritical endpoints _ , a feature which could contribute to the broadening of the experimental signal , helping to wash it out in the large thermal background . as in monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the peculiarities of the finite system become relevant ( technically , this corresponds to the need of inclusion of irrelevant operators in the formalism ) . in that case",
    ", one has either to use the knowledge of the peculiarities of the system or resort to finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques to extract indirect information about criticality .",
    "finally , we also propose a chi - squared method for searching the critical endpoint of qcd and determining its universality class that could be useful in the process of data analysis in hic experiments , in particular in the beam energy scan program at rhic - bnl and at fair - gsi .",
    "finite - size effects in the study of phase transitions via lattice simulations , seen as an inevitable drawback of the method , and the necessary extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit have been thoroughly studied for decades @xcite , the ultimate answer to the problem being given by the method of fss @xcite .",
    "systematic calculations of finite - volume corrections can then be computed not only near the criticality of continuous ( second - order ) transitions , but also for first - order phase transitions @xcite , so that the thermodynamic limit can be taken in the calculation of properties of phase diagram .",
    "however , for natural systems that are truly small , one should study the modifications caused by its finitude in the phase diagram before comparing to experimental observables .",
    "this is the situation in the study of the chiral transition in hics .",
    "contrasting to the large number of studies in the computation of the chiral condensate and related quantities within chiral perturbation theory ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , this issue is often overlooked in the case of the quark - gluon plasma . among the exceptions ,",
    "there is a lattice estimate of finite - size effects in the process of formation of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite , a few studies within the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite , and an analysis of color superconductivity in dense qcd in a finite volume @xcite , besides investigations of finite - size effects on the dynamics of the plasma @xcite .",
    "the effect of finite volume on the pion mass and chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and zero density was investigated by braun _",
    "_ using the proper - time renormalization group @xcite .    to describe the chiral phase structure of strong interactions at finite temperature and baryon density , we adopt the linear sigma model @xmath3 \\psi_{f } + \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma% \\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma- v(\\sigma,\\vec{\\pi})\\ ; ,   \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the quark chemical potential , @xmath5 is the self - interaction potential for the mesons , exhibiting both spontaneous and explicit breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "we dropped the pion terms for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath2 massive fermion fields @xmath6 represent the up and down constituent - quark fields @xmath7 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath8 plays the role of an approximate order parameter for the chiral transition , being an exact order parameter for massless quarks and pions .",
    "quarks constitute a thermalized fluid that provides a background in which the long wavelength modes of the chiral condensate evolve .",
    "we incorporate quark thermal fluctuations in the effective potential for @xmath9 , i.e. we integrate over quarks to one loop .",
    "the parameters of the lagrangian are chosen such that the effective model reproduces correctly the phenomenology of qcd at low energies and in the vacuum .",
    "so , we impose that the chiral @xmath10 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum , and the expectation values of the condensates are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13  mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking term is determined by the pcac relation which gives @xmath14 , where @xmath15mev is the pion mass .",

    "the choice @xmath20 , which yields a reasonable mass for the constituent quarks in the vacuum , @xmath21 , leads to a crossover at finite temperature , @xmath22 , and vanishing chemical potential , so that the first - order transition line that starts at vanishing temperature and nonzero chemical potential stops at a critical endpoint .    in the case of a finite system of linear size @xmath23",
    ", the momentum integral from the one - loop quark contribution to the effective potential is substituted by a sum @xmath24 \\;,\\]]where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the effective mass of the quarks .",
    "it is clear that finite - size effects in a quantum field theory are , in a way , very similar to thermal effects with @xmath27 playing the role of the temperature @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter boundary conditions are determined by the spin - statistics theorem , whereas in the former there is no clear guidance ( see , e.g. , discussions in refs .",
    "choosing periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are useful to focus on bulk properties of the model undisturbed by surface effects @xcite , but one is always free to choose anti - periodic boundary conditions ( apc ) or any other , instead . depending on the physical situation of interest , a boundary condition may be more realistic than others . to illustrate the dependence of the pseudocritical phase diagram on the boundary conditions , we show results for pbc and apc . for pbc , e.g.",
    ", the components of the momentum assume the discretized values @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 being integers , and there is a zero mode ( absent for apc , for which @xmath30 ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "this zero mode in the case with pbc will modify the classical potential , generating size - dependent effective couplings and masses .",

    "figure [ phdiags ] displays the shift of the pseudocritical transition lines and their respective endpoints as the size of the system is decreased .",
    "the transition lines represent pseudo - first - order transitions , characterized by a discontinuity in the approximate order parameter , the chiral condensate @xmath8 , and the production of latent heat through the process of phase conversion . we find that those lines are displaced to the region of higher @xmath35 and shrinked by finite - size corrections .",
    "the former effect is sensibly larger when pbc are considered , indicating that the presence of the spatial zero mode tends to shift the transition region to the regime of larger chemical potentials .",
    "both boundary conditions reproduce the infinite - volume limit for @xmath36 fm .",
    "figure [ cep ] shows the corresponding displacement of the pseudocritical endpoint , comparing pbc and apc : both coordinates of the critical point are significantly modified , and @xmath37 is about @xmath38 larger for pbc . for @xmath39 , the crossover transition",
    "is also affected by finite - size corrections , increasing as the system decreases , as shown in figure [ tcrossover ] .",
    "again , pbc generate larger effects : up to @xmath40 increase in the crossover transition temperature at @xmath39 when @xmath41 fm .     as a function of the inverse size @xmath27 for the cases with pbc and apc.,width=234 ]     as a function of the inverse size @xmath27 for the cases with pbc and apc.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] [ tcrossover ]    results for the isentropic trajectories are shown in figure [ isentropics ] , comparing the infinite - volume limit with the finite system with @xmath41 fm in the cases with pbc and apc .",
    "for sufficiently high temperatures , the isentropic lines in the thermodynamic limit are reproduced , while large discrepancies are found around and below the transition region .",
    "the remarkable variations at low temperatures are due to the shift of the pseudocritical line and , for pbc , to the zero - mode - induced modifications of the vacuum properties , especially the vacuum constituent quark mass .",
    "although there is no strong focusing effect around the critical endpoint ( as observed previously for this chiral model @xcite and similar ones @xcite ) , it is clear that the density of isentropic trajectories around the pseudocritical endpoint is sensibly higher than in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the red dot is the genuine critical endpoint , while the square is pseudocritical one.,width=226 ]",
    "the close neighborhood of critical points exhibit strong and peculiar scaling behavior that can be used as signals of its presence @xcite .",
    "this fact has been recognized long ago as a possible means of detecting experimentally the critical endpoint of qcd by using event - by - event analysis in hic experiments @xcite .",
    "in fact , higher moments of fluctuations of particle multiplicities diverge with increasing powers of the correlation length @xcite . as discussed in the introduction and shown quantitatively for the chiral phase diagram in the last section , finite - size corrections are relevant in the context of hics , not only smoothening those singularities but also generating shifted peaks and pseudocritical observables .",
    "based on the analysis of the last section , the amount of displacement of the pseudocritical transition parameters that are probed at each experimental event should present a significant centrality ( size ) dependence . therefore ,",
    "when considering data from a centrality window , there is an average between different peaks which should broaden even further the non - monotonic signal of the pseudocritical endpoint .",
    "furthermore , if the transition line is indeed strongly shrinked and shifted to higher chemical potentials , the current experiments may not be able to probe this regime of pseudocritical peaks and no non - monotonic behaviour would be found in the data . finally ,",
    "if this is not the case , to obtain , within this method , experimental information about the genuine qcd critical endpoint , one would need to gather a set of pseudocritical endpoint measurements for different system sizes and apply a procedure of extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit , namely a fss analysis .",
    "recently , it was proposed that a fss analysis on top of the critical point would be a more efficient way of searching @xcite , and , as mentioned previously , fss was also used before in the context of the dynamics of a first - order transition in qcd in a finite - volume quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the caveat of the aforementioned method for searching experimentally the critical endpoint of qcd is the assumption that one is essentially on top of the criticality .",
    "this condition will be hardly met in hic experiments , at least with enough statistics to stand out of the background . even if one is very close , or on top , of the critical point , a system that is as small as the quark - gluon plasma created under these conditions , where all relevant length scales are close @xcite , will be strongly affected by finite - size effects .",
    "namely , all singularities will be rounded and spread , something that can provide misleading artifact `` signals '' even in a fss analysis when restricted to the assumption of being on top of the critical point .",
    "the alternative is simply making use of the full power of fss , which is a method that is valid also when one is not so close to the critical point and temperature @xmath22 , the region where the scaling becomes important is characterized by @xmath42 .",
    "] , provided that we use full scaling plots .",
    "this technique is predictive even for tiny systems in statistical mechanics ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and , since it can be used in various different regions of the phase diagram not far from the critical point , it can in principle provide enough statistics for data analysis .",
    "we propose the use of this method to search for the critical point of qcd and determine its universality class , making profit out of the fact that we can build out of heavy ion data a set of systems of different sizes .",
    "the fss hypothesis @xcite , that can be derived applying the renormalization group to critical phenomena @xcite , states that an observable @xmath43 in a finite system at temperature @xmath22 can be written , in the neighborhood of criticality , in the form @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the reduced temperature ( @xmath46 being the temperature associated with the critical point ) , @xmath47 is the bulk ( dimension ) exponent of @xmath43 , @xmath48 the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath49 a length to fix the renormalization procedure , and @xmath50 the critical exponent of the correlation length that diverges as @xmath51 at criticality is a dimensionless measure of the distance to the critical point when no other external parameter is considered . in the presence of other external parameters , such as @xmath4 , one should redefine this distance accordingly : @xmath52 . ] .",
    "the function @xmath53 is universal up to scales fixing , and the critical exponents are sensitive essentially to dimensionality and internal symmetry , which will give rise to the different universality classes @xcite .    the critical contribution to experimental observables such as moments of fluctuations of particle multiplicities near the critical point @xcite will suffer sizable corrections from the function @xmath54 that can be computed within a model .",
    "one should note that the observables satisfying the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) are the ones directly related to correlation function of the order parameter of the transition , such as fluctuations of the multiplicity of soft pions , as discussed in ref .",
    "therefore , a careful investigation of how the evolution of the system in the hadronic phase and the large background of thermal correlations might affect or even hide the scaling behaviour of a given experimental observable is demanded .",
    "looking for the collapse of points representing different sizes of the system at @xmath55 @xcite can be dangerously misleading when there is not enough statistics as in hics ) is oversimplified into a necessary but not sufficient condition for fss and the maximum collapse observed is well beyond the propagated errorbars .",
    "inspired by the precision observed in extensive fss analyses in statistical physics , we expect the genuine scaling phenomenon to manifest inside the experimental errorbars .",
    "furthermore , a robust statement of scaling observation should be based on data with larger statistics , including different carefully chosen observables simultaneously and further studies within statistical models to garantee minimum interference of the thermal background and the existence of the full scaling hypothesis . ] .    plotting observables such as cumulants of fluctuations of _ soft _ pions properly normalized ( which constains in principle a small anomalous contribution ) , but also the factors , such as mesonic couplings , involved in the connection of the pion fluctuations to the correlation functions of the order parameter of the chiral transition . ] and as a function of the full scaling variable @xmath56 can be an efficient method for searching the critical endpoint of qcd and determining its universality class . the critical temperature and chemical potential ( the coordinates of the critical endpoint ) as well as",
    "the critical exponents would be parameters in a fit ( scaling plot ) , in the same manner as is done in statistical mechanics simulations . in hics , one can arrange the data as representing systems of different sizes by using centrality bins , or by directly using the number of participants in the collision , instead of @xmath23 , in the scaling plot- and @xmath57-independent multiplicative factors . therefore , the knowledge of the actual size of the system during the phase conversion process is not needed , as long as we have an observable that scales with it ( like the square root of the number of participants in the case of hic , with an approximately 2d initial geometry ) . ] . or each system of a given size , and also a given center - of - mass energy @xmath58 , one can estimate the temperature and chemical potential employing thermal models in the chemical freeze - out , or use directly @xmath59 , @xmath60 substituting @xmath61 as the free parameter associated with the position of the genuine critical endpoint . when one plots",
    "@xmath62 as a function of , e.g. , @xmath22 ( not a scaling plot ) , one finds scattered curves that cross in the critical point . in a full scaling plot , though , that uses the correct scaling variable , all these curves collapse , provided that the system is not far from the critical point , as a consequence of scaling and universality . by finding the correct critical exponents in the case of the qcd phase transition in hics , one would determine its universality class .",
    "one can search for this full scaling behavior in different cumulants of fluctuations and in different parts of the phase diagram , increasing dramatically the statistics . still , realistically , the thermal background of particle production could , in principle , hide the critical contribution inside the error bars and the process of finding the correct value of the critical exponent could be difficult . therefore , to put in practice the idea of",
    "scaling - plot fits described above , we may introduce the following chi - squared method .",
    "once an ensemble of experimental results for the properly normalized observable is obtained , one can find the best scaling fit via the minimization of the quadratic deviation among them .",
    "for example , let @xmath63for the observables @xmath43 ( say , cummulants of soft pion fluctations )",
    ". then we may define the following @xmath64 function@xmath65where the sums are taken over all pairs of @xmath66 keeping the scaling variable @xmath67 constant , with @xmath68if all of @xmath43 values for different @xmath69 obey the finite size scaling , then the above @xmath64 should vanish at the correct value of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for any @xmath67 . for energies to which the observables attain values close to the critical point , then we should have a very week @xmath67-dependence of @xmath70 and @xmath71 and also the value of @xmath64 at the minimum , only coming from the statistical errors . in practice",
    ", we plot @xmath64 for a given @xmath72 ( or various combinations of @xmath73 and localize the minimum in @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    thus , by studying the energy dependence of the minimum of the above quantity",
    ", we may identify the energy value which passes close to the critical point with the free variational parameters being the critical exponent @xmath70 and the critical center - of - mass energy @xmath71 ( and @xmath74 in the general case ) .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed different aspects of finite - size effects that render crucial features in various proposed signatures of the qcd critical endpoint in hics .",
    "on one hand , in addition to the usual smoothening and broadening of singularities , the finiteness of the physical system under a phase conversion process shifts pseudocritical observables associated with pseudocritical parameters with respect to the genuine criticality , in the thermodynamic limit . we have shown that those displacements in the case of the chiral transition can be large for energy scales typically encountered in current experiments , shrinking the @xmath22-@xmath4 domain where discontinuities of the chiral condensate are found and pushing the pseudocritical lines further into the high chemical potential region .",
    "these findings should affect all signatures of the critical endpoint based on non - monotonic behaviours or sign changes in particle correlation fluctuations , probably contributing to the broadening of the signal within a not sufficiently small centrality window .",
    "based on this considerations we proposed the use of the full power of the fss hypothesis as a tool to detect and locate the genuine chiral critical endpoint of qcd , and determine its corresponding universality class , using hics experiments .",
    "we also described a chi - squared method that can be applied to data in a systematic manner to investigate the presence of the scaling phenomenom in the beam energy scan project at rhic and in future observations at fair .    finally , to address the question of the viability of these different proposed signatures of the qcd critical endpoint when immersed in a large hadronic thermal background , as the one expected in the case of hics , an interesting test to make would be the comparison of monte carlo simulations of thermal ensembles with and without a small fraction of critically correlated soft pions .",
