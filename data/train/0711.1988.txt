    "a 3 + 1 decomposition of einstein s equations results in a set of constraint equations , which constrain the gravitational fields at all instants of coordinate time , and a set of evolution equations , which propagate the fields forward in time ( e.g.  ) .",
    "the four constraint equations can constrain only a subset of the gravitational fields . therefore , the constraint equations can be solved , for example for the construction of initial data , only after the constrained variables have been separated from freely specifiable ones , and after suitable choices have been made for the latter ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the constrained variables are separated from the freely specifiable ones by choosing a decomposition of the constraint equations . the conformal thin - sandwich decomposition @xcite has been particularly popular for the construction of quasiequilibrium data ; it has been used extensively , for example , to model compact binaries containing black holes or neutron stars ( see , e.g. , for reviews ) . in the conformal thin - sandwich formalism , the spatial metric is conformally decomposed into a conformal factor and the conformally related metric , and the extrinsic curvature into its trace and a traceless part . in the so - called extended version @xcite , the freely specifiable variables are the conformally related metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature together with their time derivatives ( which we may set to zero to construct equilibrium data ) , and the constrained variables are the lapse , the shift , and the conformal factor .",
    "black holes may be constructed within the conformal thin - sandwich formalism by excising the black hole interior , and imposing suitable inner boundary conditions . in particular",
    ", these boundary conditions may be chosen so that the black hole is momentarily isolated , or in equilibrium ( see @xcite , also compare the isolated horizon formalism laid out in @xcite and references therein ) . as discussed in detail in @xcite ,",
    "these geometric conditions lead to boundary conditions on some of the constrained variables in the thin - sandwich formalism , namely the conformal factor and the shift vector .",
    "the boundary condition for the lapse , however , remains arbitrary .",
    "some of the choices in this formalism will clearly have an effect on the physical content of the solution .",
    "we can expect to find equilibrium solutions only if we set the time derivatives of the conformally related metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature to zero .",
    "also , a conformally flat solution is physically distinct from solutions that are not conformally flat .",
    "the choice of the trace of the extrinsic curvature , or mean curvature , is usually associated with an initial temporal gauge , and the lapse plays a similar role .",
    "it is less clear , then , whether or how the mean curvature and the boundary condition on the lapse affect the solutions .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors found that sequences of binary black holes , and in particular their innermost stable circular orbit , do depend on the horizon lapse for their example of a non - maximal slicing , i.e.  non - zero mean curvature .",
    "this finding , however , may be an artifact of their particular choice of the mean curvature , namely a superposition of two copies of its analytical value for a single schwarzschild black hole expressed in kerr - schild coordinates ( see ( [ k_ks ] ) below ) , one for each companion in the binary .",
    "as the authors caution , the resulting background geometry then depends on binary separation , making the physical meaning of these sequences somewhat arguable .",
    "we consider a very simple physical system in order to analyze whether , at least in this context , the choice of the mean curvature and the horizon lapse affect the physical content of the solutions .",
    "specifically , we solve the constraint equations in the thin - sandwich decomposition to construct thin shells of non - interacting , isotropic particles in circular orbit about a schwarzschild black hole ( compare @xcite , whose results we generalize to account for the black hole ) .",
    "for one particular choice of the mean curvature and the horizon lapse the equations can be solved analytically ( see appendix [ appa ] ) , and we construct numerical solutions for many others . we find that these different choices have no effect on our solutions when they are expressed in terms of gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "we write the spacetime metric @xmath0 in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lapse function , @xmath3 the shift vector , and @xmath4 the spatial metric .",
    "we further decompose the latter as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a conformal factor and @xmath7 a conformally related metric .",
    "we then solve einstein s constraint equations in the conformal thin - sandwich decomposition ( see , as well as @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "specifically , the hamiltonian constraint becomes @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the energy density as measured by a normal observer , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the covariant derivative and the ricci scalar associated with the metric @xmath7 .",
    "we have also split the extrinsic curvature @xmath13 into its trace @xmath14 and a traceless part @xmath15 according to @xmath16 from the evolution equation for the spatial metric we can express @xmath17 as @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the conformal killing operator @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 the momentum constraint can now be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a vector laplacian , and @xmath25 is the mass current as measured by a normal observer . finally , the trace of the evolution equation for @xmath13 , combined with the hamiltonian constraint , results in @xmath26 where @xmath27 the trace of the spatial stress .",
    "the above equations form a set of equations for the lapse @xmath2 , the shift @xmath3 and the conformal factor @xmath6 .",
    "before these equations can be solved , however , we have to make choices for the freely specifiable quantities @xmath7 , @xmath28 , @xmath14 and @xmath29 . for the construction of quasiequilibrium data",
    "it is natural to choose @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will also restrict our analysis to spherical symmetry , where we may assume conformal flatness , @xmath32 , without loss of generality . here",
    "@xmath33 is the flat metric in whatever coordinate system .",
    "we will , however , experiment with different choices for @xmath14 ( see equations ( [ k ] ) below ) , as well as with different boundary conditions for the lapse @xmath2 ( see ( [ alphahorbound ] ) below ) .    with these choices , and in spherical symmetry ,",
    "the above equations simplify dramatically .",
    "we write the spatial metric as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the isotropic radial coordinate .",
    "the shift @xmath3 is now purely radial , and we abbreviate @xmath36",
    ". we may evaluate ( [ lbar ] ) to find @xmath37 so that @xmath38 becomes @xmath39 the hamiltonian constraint ( [ psiconstraint ] ) can then be written as    [ diffeq ] @xmath40 the momentum constraint ( [ betaconstraint ] ) as @xmath41 and the lapse equation ( [ alphaconstraint ] ) as @xmath42    here we have expressed all quantities in terms of those variables that are used in our code .    in the above equations the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath14 can still be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "following @xcite we consider two different possibilities , namely maximal slicing    [ k ] @xmath43 and kerr - schild slicing @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the areal radius , @xmath46 , and we identify @xmath47 with the black hole s irreducible mass ( see ( [ mirr ] ) below ) .",
    "kerr - schild coordinates are identical to ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the subscript @xmath48 to refer to the black hole , and @xmath49 to indicate a property of the shell .      at spatial infinity",
    "we impose asymptotic flatness , which results in the boundary conditions @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "we excise the black hole interior inside an isotropic radius @xmath52 and impose the black hole equilibrium boundary conditions of @xcite on the resulting excision surface @xmath53 ( compare the notion of isolated horizons laid out in ) . in particular",
    ", the condition @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the outward - pointing unit normal to the horizon , ensures that this surface corresponds to a marginally trapped surface ( apparent horizon ) , while the condition @xmath56 ensures that the coordinate system tracks the horizon .",
    "( the tangential components of the shift vanish identically in spherical symmetry . ) in our case , ( [ psihorbound ] ) becomes    [ inboundcond ] @xmath57 and ( [ betahorbound ] ) @xmath58    as discussed in @xcite , the boundary condition for the lapse @xmath59 is arbitrary .",
    "we will experiment with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath60    and will compare results for values of @xmath61 ranging from zero to unity in increments of 0.1 .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric shell of isotropic , non - interacting particles in circular orbit about the black hole ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the rest energy ( baryon mass ) of a spherically symmetric matter source may be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the lorentz factor between a normal observer @xmath64 and an observer comoving with the fluid @xmath65 .",
    "for an infinitesimally thin shell we can then identify the rest energy density ( baryon density ) as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ( isotropic ) radius of the shell .    since the particles are non - interacting",
    ", their stress - energy tensor is that of a pressureless fluid ( dust ) : @xmath68 .",
    "the matter sources @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in equations ( [ psiconstraintmod ] ) , ( [ betaconstraintmod ] ) and ( [ alphaconstraintmod ] ) can therefore be expressed as @xmath72 the delta function in these matter sources leads to a discontinuity in the derivatives of the solutions .",
    "we can find the jump in these derivatives by integrating equations ( [ betaconstraint ] ) , ( [ psiconstraint ] ) and ( [ alphaconstraint ] ) from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , which , in the limit @xmath75 , results in the jump conditions @xmath76    since the particles are non - interacting , their 4-velocity @xmath65 obeys the geodesic equation @xmath77 assuming circular orbits with @xmath78 and @xmath79 and , without loss of generality , focussing on a particle in the equatorial plane , we find @xmath80 using the normalization condition @xmath81 , which is equivalent to @xmath82 , we evaluate ( [ geodesicmod ] ) to find the geodesic condition @xmath83 for circular orbits . to compute the christoffel symbols we averaged the derivatives of the gravitational field variables inside and outside the shell ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the adm and komar masses using the expressions ( see e.g. chap .  7 of @xcite ) @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the outward pointing unit surface element of a closed surface at infinity . in our case , these expressions reduce to @xmath87 and @xmath88 for all configurations considered in this paper , the two mass expressions are found to be equivalent to within the accuracy of our code when the geodesic equation ( [ geodesiccondition ] ) is used to force the particles into circular orbit ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "this is in agreement with a general theorem about the equality of adm and komar masses established by beig @xcite and ashtekar & magnon - ashtekar @xcite .",
    "we also define the binding energy as @xmath89 either terms of the adm or komar mass .",
    "finally , we compute the black hole s irreducible mass from the area @xmath90 of the apparent horizon , @xmath91",
    "we developed a pseudo - spectral code to solve the differential equations ( [ diffeq ] ) subject to the boundary conditions ( [ infbound ] ) and ( [ inboundcond ] ) as well as the jump conditions ( [ jumpconditions ] ) , using chebyshev polynomials as basis functions ( see @xcite for a recent review of spectral methods ) . equations ( [ betaconstraintmod ] ) and ( [ alphaconstraintmod ] ) can be solved directly , while equation ( [ psiconstraintmod ] ) has to be linearized and then solved iteratively .",
    "one complication arises as a consequence of the jump conditions ( [ jumpconditions ] ) .",
    "representing the solution functions across these jumps as a linear combination of the continuous chebyshev polynomials would result in undesirable gibbs phenomena . to avoid this problem",
    ", we solve the equations in two separate domains inside and outside the shell , each one represented by @xmath92 chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the @xmath92 coefficients can then be determined by evaluating the equation at @xmath92 collocation points in each domain , and the jump conditions ( [ jumpconditions ] ) can then be imposed exactly as matching conditions between the two sets of chebyshev polynomials .",

    "we start the iteration from the analytical solution for @xmath105 and @xmath106 provided in appendix [ appa ] , and continue until the solution has converged .",

    "<S> we find that these different choices have no effect on our solutions when they are expressed in terms of gauge - invariant quantities . </S>"
