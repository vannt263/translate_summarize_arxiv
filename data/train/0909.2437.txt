    "a key goal of modern observational cosmology is to discover and study the first galaxies , and to quantify their role in the reionisation of the neutral universe at redshifts @xmath19 ( dunkley et al . ,",
    "studies of quasars have now reached beyond @xmath16 ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2006 ) and indicate that the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) optical depth due to neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) increases significantly at these redshifts .",
    "whatever the precise implications for reionisation physics , the increased strength of the lyman - break produced by this enhanced optical depth should make it relatively straightforward to select still higher - redshift objects via the lyman - break technique ( e.g. steidel et al . 1996 ) , given sufficiently sensitive broad - band imaging .    over recent years",
    ", galaxy evolution studies have indeed been successfully extended to redshifts @xmath20 , via both ground - based and _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) searches for objects with either strong lyman breaks and/or strong lyman-@xmath21 emission at observed wavelengths @xmath22  ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2004 ; yan & windhorst 2004 ; stark et al . , 2007 ; bouwens et al . 2008 ; richard et al . 2008 ;",
    "mclure et al . 2009 ; oesch et al .",
    "2009a ; zheng et al .",
    "2009 ; ouchi et al .",
    "however , it has proved very difficult to push the discovery space beyond @xmath12 .",
    "the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift is @xmath23 ( iye et al .",
    "2006 ) , and there currently exist at most 2 or 3 convincing candidates at redshifts just greater than @xmath24 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2008 ; bradley et al .",
    "2008 ; richard et al . 2008",
    "; oesch et al . 2009a ; see section 2 ) .",
    "this current redshift `` limit '' is almost certainly in part due to continued ( potentially steepening ) decline in the number density of galaxies at higher redshifts , as anticipated from the negative evolution of the galaxy luminosity function found between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ; mclure et al .",
    ". however , action is clearly required at higher redshifts to commence and maintain reionisation , and extensive star - formation at @xmath19 is implied by the stellar masses of galaxies at @xmath16 ( stark et al .",
    "2009 ) and by reports of balmer breaks in their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( eyles et al . 2007 ) .",
    "most recently , spectacular direct evidence of action at @xmath27 has been provided by the discovery of a gamma ray burst at @xmath28 ( tanvir et al .",
    "2009 ; salvaterra et al .",
    "consequently the most likely reason for the current galaxy redshift limit of @xmath12 is a practical one , namely that the convincing discovery of galaxies at higher redshifts requires more sensitive near - infrared imaging than has been available until now .",
    "specifically , to uncover a galaxy at @xmath13 on the basis of a strong lyman break at @xmath29  requires deep imaging at @xmath30 in at least 2 filters ( to establish the existence of a blue continuum longward of the break ) , _ and _ imaging at @xmath31 of sufficient depth for a non - detection to provide convincing evidence of a sharp lyman break in the spectrum .",
    "the recent installation of wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hst offers the first realistic opportunity to achieve the required multi - filter near - infrared sensitivity levels over significant areas of sky . in this study",
    "we use the first deep imaging from this revolutionary new instrument to extend the study of galaxy evolution into the crucial reionisation epoch corresponding to @xmath32 ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the specific aim of the work presented here is to use the first release of deep hst wfc3/ir imaging in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) , in tandem with the existing hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) optical imaging to select and study a new sample of galaxies at @xmath20 , with the expectation that this new sample could extend to @xmath33 ( due to the extreme depth of the new near - infrared imaging  see section 3 ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize what is currently known about high - redshift galaxies in the hudf , based on the handful of potential @xmath34 galaxy candidates selected using the existing hst nicmos+acs dataset .",
    "the new wfc3/ir data are described in section 3 , where we summarize the key properties of the new wfc3/ir instrument , discuss the observing strategy of the hst hudf09 treasury programme , and explain how we reduced the raw near - infrared imaging data after public release on september 9 , 2009 .",
    "next , in section 4 , we describe how we selected and refined our high - redshift galaxy catalogue from the combined wfc3/ir+acs+spitzer imaging data now available in the field .",
    "we also explain how we used sed fitting to derive photometric redshifts ( with confidence intervals ) for all plausible high - redshift galaxy candidates , and used this information to clean the sample for a range of contaminants . in section 5 we present and discuss the final sample of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath35 , explore the robustness and implications of the new very high - redshift sub - sample , derive a first meaningful estimate of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function out to @xmath13 , and briefly explore the implications for our understanding of cosmic reionisation .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we give all magnitudes in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) , and for cosmological calculations assume @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the first study to claim to have isolated galaxies at `` @xmath39 '' was that of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who reported 6 @xmath5-drops derived from the combined nicmos @xmath40 , @xmath41 and acs @xmath5 imaging of the hudf .",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suspected that two of their candidates were possibly not real ( udf-491 - 880 , and udf-818 - 886 ) , due to the fact they were not found in an independent reduction of the nicmos imaging undertaken by massimo robberto .",
    "this scepticism was justified , as neither of these objects is seen in the new , deeper wfc3/ir imaging .",
    "subsequently , bouwens et al .",
    "( 2008 ) added a fifth plausible candidate .",
    "this , plus one of the original 4 candidates , was also identified as a high - redshift candidate in an independent study by oesch et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .    the positions of these 5 surviving nicmos - selected @xmath12 galaxy candidates , along with their pre - existing alternative catalogue names , are summarized in table 1 .",
    "our own analysis of the nicmos+acs photometry for these objects in fact indicates that only the first two objects listed in table 1 ( i.e. the two galaxies confirmed by oesch et al .",
    "2009a ) actually lie at @xmath19 , and sed fits and redshift constraints on these two galaxies are illustrated in fig . 1 ( see section 4.2 for details of the sed fitting procedure ) .",

    "catalogue numbers as used by bouwens et al .",

    "cols=\"^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]          details on the final high - redshift sample of 49 galaxies are provided in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the galaxies are ranked in order of increasing redshift , and table 2 summarises the results of the redshift estimation process , giving primary and secondary redshift solutions , along with 1@xmath42 confidence intervals , and the minimum value of @xmath43 at each solution . with the number of degrees of freedom involved in the fitting process",
    ", a solution with @xmath44 must be regarded as statistically acceptable .",
    "postage stamp images , sed fits , and plots of @xmath43 versus @xmath45 for all 49 galaxies are given in appendix a , with the galaxy candidates again ranked in the same order of increasing primary redshift .",
    "galaxies which have been independently discovered as @xmath5-drops by oesch et al .",
    "( 2009b ) are marked with a superscript @xmath45 , while the 5 candidates independently discovered as @xmath6-drops by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are marked with the superscript @xmath46 .",
    "table 3 gives the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath47 and @xmath41 magnitudes for each galaxy , as measured through a 0.6-arcsec diameter aperture , with the wfc3/ir values decreased ( i.e. brightened ) by the small systematic relative correction factors given above in section 4.1 .",
    "although we are primarily interested in galaxies at @xmath34 we have retained all galaxy candidates from our original sample which have a primary redshift solution @xmath3 , because the redshift probability distributions for these objects frequently extend well beyond @xmath16 , and this information requires to be factored into our determination of the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath12 .",
    "our insistence on 2@xmath42 non - detections in the @xmath48-band means that the sample can not be regarded as reasonably complete until @xmath49 . at higher redshifts",
    "this sample can be regarded as a master list of all convincing candidates for galaxies at @xmath49 , brighter than a magnitude @xmath50 ( ab ) . in at least one near - infrared passband in the 4.5arcmin@xmath4 area covered by the wfc3/ir image of the hudf .",
    "it does _ not _ follow that all candidates are equally robust , as can be judged from the plots presented in appendix a , and the alternative redshift solutions quantified in table 2 .",
    "our independent list , selected without recourse to hard optical - infrared colour criteria , contains all but the faintest of the 16 @xmath51 galaxies listed by oesch et al .",
    "( 2009b ) ( which in turn includes the 4 credible @xmath20 galaxies from bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) listed in table 1 ) .",
    "our sample also includes all 5 of the @xmath52 galaxies listed by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "our list contains an additional 15 objects at @xmath49 which have evaded selection by oesch et al .",
    "( 2009b ) and bouwens et al .",
    "in general , inspection of the additional objects reveals that they lie just outside or on the edge of the colour selection boxes adopted in these alternative studies .",
    "however , use of our own 0.6-arcsec photometry would also lead us to locate several of the objects selected by oesch et al . and bouwens et al .",
    "outside their adopted selection boxes , and in general the @xmath43 plots shown in appendix a do not suggest that our additional candidates are any less robust than those selected via strict colour criteria .",
    "in addition to providing a new , more complete list of candidates , our analysis of course yields quantitative constraints on the redshifts of all sources , and information to allow the reader to properly assess the robustness of each individual high - redshift galaxy candidate .",
    "given the natural interest in the possible discovery of galaxies at @xmath19 , we focus first on the existence and robustness of potential galaxies at @xmath13 .",
    "as discussed above , our sample contains @xmath53 galaxies at @xmath19 , of which nominally 3 lie at @xmath27 . of the sub - sample of 8 galaxies with primary redshift solutions at @xmath11 ,",
    "five are the @xmath13 galaxy candidates reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and one was selected as a @xmath45-drop by oesch et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "thus the majority of these apparently extremely distant galaxy candidates have been identified more than once , in independent reductions and analyses of the combined wfc3/ir+acs dataset .",
    "however , we caution that , given the number of degrees of freedom in our sed fitting , any redshift solution with @xmath44 is acceptable at the @xmath54 level . thus , given the available data , all 8 - 10 objects apparently at @xmath11 could also lie at @xmath55 , at which point the 4000  or balmer break in a galaxy spectrum has begun to move into the f105w bandpass .",
    "the problem here is one of dynamic range .",
    "the wfc3/ir imaging is so deep that a non - detection in the acs @xmath5 and other hudf optical images is not sufficient to discriminate between the extreme lyman - break at 1215  anticipated at @xmath13 , from the more modest 4000 / balmer break in a low - luminosity galaxy at much lower redshift . for the faintest proposed @xmath52 galaxy candidates , the available photometry produces redshift constraints which are inevitably rather weak .",
    "nonetheless , we note here something else of at least qualitative interest about these @xmath13 galaxy candidates , which is that they appear to be strongly clustered on the sky ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . for example",
    ", the four apparently most distant objects in the sample occur in two pairs with projected galaxy separations @xmath56arcsec",
    "( @xmath57 kpc at @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , it should be cautioned that the suggestion of clustering does not necessarily strengthen the case that these objects are genuine @xmath59 galaxies , given that the most probable interloper population ( i.e. galaxies at @xmath60 ) could also be clustered .",
    "finally , we stress that , even if the high - redshift solutions are adopted for these objects , we have yet to uncover a completely compelling example of a galaxy at @xmath27 in the wfc3/ir image of the hudf .",
    "based on our new dataset it is possible to make a preliminary estimate of the ultraviolet ( uv ) galaxy luminosity function at @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in order to exploit the redshift information available for our sample ,",
    "when deriving the luminosity function we adopt the method outlined in mclure et al .",
    "( 2009 ) whereby , rather than simply adopting the primary photometric redshift solution , each object is represented by its normalized redshift probability density function .",
    "in addition to making better use of the available information , this method makes it possible to construct the luminosity function using the classic @xmath63 estimator of schmidt ( 1968 ) , and deals with the problem of multiple redshift solutions in a transparent fashion .    in fig .",
    "5 we show our estimates of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 galaxy luminosity functions , which were calculated within the redshift intervals @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively",
    ". in both panels the data - points from this study are shown as the filled circles , and in the left - hand panel we also plot the @xmath61 data - points at bright magnitudes from the ground - based study of the subaru deep field and goods - north field by ouchi et al .",
    "although a full analysis of the evolving uv - selected luminosity function is deferred until the remainder of the deep hudf09 wfc3/ir data are obtained over the coming year , we have performed a simple fit to the @xmath61 luminosity function , including the ouchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) data - points at the bright end .",
    "the best - fitting schechter function is shown as the solid line in the left - hand panel of fig . 5 and yields the following parameter values : @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "due to the large uncertainties on the data - points it is not possible to place meaningful constraints on either @xmath68 or @xmath21 at @xmath61 .",
    "however , a comparison with the best - fitting schechter luminosity function parameters at @xmath69 ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) from mclure et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , suggests that the @xmath69 and @xmath61 luminosity functions have very similar shapes , and can be reconciled via an evolution in number density by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "the limited dynamical range in absolute luminosity makes it impossible , at present , to place any meaningful constraints on the shape of the uv - selected galaxy luminosity function at @xmath62 .",
    "all that can be said with the current dataset is that , at a characteristic luminosity of @xmath72 , the number density of high - redshift galaxies is a further factor of @xmath17 smaller than at @xmath61 . to illustrate this point we show in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "5 that the best - fitting schechter function at @xmath61 can be brought into good agreement with the @xmath62 data - points simply by reducing @xmath73 by a factor of two .",
    "although the uncertainties associated with the current dataset , along with degeneracies between schechter function parameters , prevent any definitive conclusions , it appears that the @xmath61 and @xmath62 luminosity functions are consistent with having the same overall shape as at @xmath69 , but with @xmath73 a factor of @xmath15 and @xmath74 lower respectively .",
    "given the apparent decline in the number density of star - forming galaxies over the redshift range @xmath75 , it is prudent to examine the ability of the observed population of galaxies to achieve reionisation .",
    "we adopt the method of bolton & haehnelt ( 2007 ) , converting the observed luminosity functions at @xmath76 to ionising emissivities assuming a salpeter imf , a metallicity of 0.2 z@xmath77 , and an escape fraction for ionising photons of 20% . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore any possible mass dependence in the escape fraction .",
    "we consider relatively low values for the hydrogen clumping factors in our analysis ( @xmath78 ) , following the results of recent simulations ( e.g. bolton & haehnelt 2007 ) . at @xmath79",
    ", we adopt the comoving ionising photon density implied by the ly@xmath21 opacity data presented in bolton & haehnelt ( 2007 ) , where @xmath80=10@xmath81 @xmath82 mpc@xmath83 .    for the luminosity function at @xmath84 and 8",
    ", we adopt the @xmath85 schechter parameters from mclure et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , with the normalisation ( @xmath86 ) lowered by a factor of 2.5 and 5 , respectively , consistent with the measurements presented above . to provide an upper bound on the possible contribution of the star - forming galaxy population to reionisation",
    ", we first assume the luminosity function remains constant over @xmath87 and compute the evolution of the filling factor of ionised hydrogen , @xmath88 , as a function of redshift . to do this ,",
    "we integrate the ionising emissivities forward from @xmath89 , arbitrarily assuming that the ionising flux decreases to zero at @xmath18 . defining the end of reionisation as the redshift when @xmath90 , we find that if we include only sources brighter than @xmath91 ( roughly the detection limit of the wfc3 data at @xmath61 ) , the igm would not achieve a unity hii filling factor until @xmath92 , at odds with the high ionisation fraction implied by measurements of the gunn peterson optical depth from quasars at @xmath93 ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2006 , becker et al .",
    "even if sources as faint as @xmath94 are included , reionisation would only be completed at @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 at @xmath97 ) , at odds with the transmission seen in quasar spectra at these redshifts .",
    "furthermore , each of these computations assumes that the ionising emissivity does not decrease beyond @xmath62 .",
    "if the normalisation of the luminosity function instead continues to decline at @xmath98 , consistent with the trends at @xmath99 , then the galaxy population would undoubtedly be hard - pressed to reionise the igm by @xmath85 without significant variations in the escape fraction . while caution must surely be exercised in interpreting these results given the uncertainties in the form of the luminosity functions ,",
    "our results indicate that it is difficult for the observed population of star - forming galaxies to achieve reionisation by @xmath16 without a significant contribution from galaxies well below the detection limits , in addition to alterations in the escape fraction of ionising photons and/or continued vigorous star formation at @xmath18 .",
    "following the first public data release of the raw wfc3/ir data taken within the hudf ( as part of hst treasury programme go-11563 ) , we have reduced the new deep @xmath6 , @xmath47 , and @xmath41 images , and analysed them in tandem with the existing deep optical @xmath100 acs imaging , to conduct a new systematic search for high - redshift galaxies at @xmath0 . after registering the new infrared data to the acs optical image reference frame , and establishing our own photometric zero - points , we used sextractor to select a complete parent catalogue consisting of all objects which were detected at @xmath101 significance in at least one of the near - infrared wavebands in a 0.4-arcsec diameter aperture . for the purposes of sed analysis and photometric redshift determination we performed aperture photometry on all objects within circular apertures of 0.6-arcsec diameter , applying relative ( to acs resolution ) point - source aperture corrections to the derived @xmath6 , @xmath47 , and @xmath41 magnitudes .",
    "starting from the master catalogue we confined our attention to high redshifts by rejecting all sources which were detected at @xmath102 significance in the acs @xmath103band imaging .",
    "we then performed full sed fitting to the optical+infrared photometry of the remaining @xmath104 objects in the catalogue , and utilised this information to inform the rejection of a variety of contaminants ( stars , diffraction spikes , transients ) and lower - redshift galaxy interlopers .",
    "the final result is a sample of 49 galaxies with primary photometric redshift solutions @xmath3 , within the 4.5 arcmin@xmath4 field covered by the new near - infrared imaging . our sample , selected without recourse to specific colour cuts , re - selects all but the faintest one of the 16 @xmath5-drops selected by oesch et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , recovers all 5 of the @xmath6-drops reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and adds a further 29 equally plausible galaxy candidates , of which 12 lie beyond @xmath7 , and 4 lie beyond @xmath8 . however , we also present confidence intervals on our photometric redshift estimates , marginalising over all other fitted parameters , and highlight the prevalence of alternative secondary redshift solutions ( especially for the highest redshift galaxy candidates ) . as a result of this analysis",
    "we caution that acceptable low - redshift ( @xmath9 ) solutions exist for 28 out of the 37 galaxies at @xmath10 , and in particular for all 8 of the galaxy candidates reported here at @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the very highest redshift candidates appear to be strongly clustered in the field .    based on our photometric redshift analysis we derive new estimates of the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at @xmath12 and @xmath13 . where our results are most robust , at a characteristic luminosity @xmath14 , we find that the comoving number density of galaxies declines by a factor of @xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath12 , and by a further factor of 2 by @xmath13 .",
    "these results suggest that it is difficult for the observed population of high - redshift star - forming galaxies to achieve reionisation without a significant contribution from galaxies well below the detection limits plus alterations in the escape fraction of ionising photons and/or continued vigorous star formation at @xmath18 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a systematic search for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 , within the new , deep , near - infrared ( @xmath1 ) imaging of the hubble ultra deep field provided by the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed full spectral energy distribution fitting to the optical+infrared photometry of all high - redshift galaxy candidates detected at @xmath2 significance in at least one of the wfc3/ir broad - band filters . after careful rejection of contaminants , </S>",
    "<S> the result is a sample of 49 galaxies with primary photometric redshift solutions @xmath3 , within the 4.5 arcmin@xmath4 field covered by the new near - infrared imaging . our sample , selected without recourse to specific colour cuts , re - selects all but the faintest one of the 16 @xmath5-drops selected by oesch et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) , recovers all 5 of the @xmath6-drops reported by bouwens et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) , and adds a further 29 equally plausible galaxy candidates , of which 12 lie beyond @xmath7 , and 4 lie beyond @xmath8 . however , we also present confidence intervals on our photometric redshift estimates , including alternative secondary redshift solutions . as a result of this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we caution that acceptable low - redshift ( @xmath9 ) solutions exist for 28 out of the 37 galaxies at @xmath10 , and in particular for all 8 of the galaxy candidates reported here at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we note that the very highest redshift candidates appear to be strongly clustered in the field . based on our photometric redshift analysis </S>",
    "<S> we derive new estimates of the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at @xmath12 and @xmath13 . where our results are most robust , at a characteristic luminosity @xmath14 , we find that the comoving number density of galaxies declines by a factor of @xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath12 , and by a further factor of @xmath17 by @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that it is difficult for the observed population of high - redshift star - forming galaxies to achieve reionisation by @xmath16 without a significant contribution from galaxies well below the detection limits , plus alterations in the escape fraction of ionising photons and/or continued vigorous star formation at @xmath18 .    </S>",
