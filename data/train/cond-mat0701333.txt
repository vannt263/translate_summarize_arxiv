    "rotating ultra - cold trapped bose condensed systems are most commonly discussed in the context of formation of vortex lattices , which are solutions to the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field equation @xcite .",
    "such vortex lattices have indeed been found experimentally for systems containing a large number of bosons @xcite . nevertheless , several theoretical investigations @xcite of _ rapidly _ rotating trapped bosonic systems suggested formation of strongly correlated exotic states which differ drastically from the aforementioned vortex - lattice states .",
    "while experimental realizations of such strongly correlated states have not been reported yet , there is already a significant effort associated with two - dimenional ( 2d ) exact - diagonalization ( exd ) studies of a small number of particles ( @xmath4 ) in the lowest landau level , lll ; the lll restriction corresponds to the regime of rapid rotation , where the rotational frequency of the trap @xmath5 equals the frequency @xmath6 of the confining potential .",
    "the large majority @xcite of such exd studies have attempted to establish a close connection between rapidly rotating bosonic gases and the physics of elecrtons under fractional - quantum - hall - effect ( fqhe ) conditions employing the bosonic version of `` quantum - liquid '' analytic wave functions , such as the laughlin wave functions , composite - fermion , moore - read , and pfaffian functions .",
    "recently , the `` quantum - liquid '' picture for a small number of trapped electrons in the fqhe regime has been challenged in a series of extensive studies @xcite of electrons in 2d quantum dots under high magnetic fields ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "such studies ( both exd and variational ) revealed that , at least for finite systems , the underlying physical picture governing the behavior of strongly - correlated electrons is not that of a `` quantum liquid . '' instead",
    ", the appropriate description is in terms of a `` quantum crystal , '' with the localized electrons arranged in polygonal concentric rings @xcite .",
    "these `` crystalline '' states lack @xcite the familiar rigidity of a classical extended crystal , and are better described @xcite as _ rotating electron ( _ or _ wigner ) molecules _ ( rems or rwms ) .    motivated by the discovery in the case of electrons of rems at high @xmath7 ( and from the fact that wigner molecules form also at zero magnetic field @xcite ) some theoretical studies",
    "have most recently shown that analogous molecular patterns of localized bosons do form in the case of a small number of particles inside a static or rotating harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "in analogy with the electron case , the bosonic molecular structures can be referred to @xcite as _ rotating boson molecules _ ( rbms ) ; a description of rbms via a variational wave function @xcite built from symmetry - breaking displaced gaussian orbitals with subsequent restoration of the rotational symmetry was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use exact diagonalization in the lowest landau level to investigate the formation and properties of rbms focusing on a larger number of particles than previously studied , in particular for sizes where multiple - ring formation can be expected based on our knowledge of the case of 2d electrons in high @xmath7 .",
    "we study a finite number of particles ( @xmath8 ) at _ both _ low ( @xmath9 ) and high ( @xmath10 ) filling fractions @xmath11 @xcite ( where @xmath12 is the quantum number associated with the total angular momentum @xmath13 ) and investigate both the cases of a long ( coulomb ) and a short ( @xmath14-function ) range repulsive interaction .",
    "as in the case of electrons in 2d quantum dots , we probe the crystalline nature of the bosonic ground states by calculating the full anisotropic two - point correlation function @xmath15 associated with the exact wavefunction @xmath16 . the quantity @xmath15 is proportional to the probability of finding a boson at @xmath17 given that there is another boson at the observation point @xmath18 , and it is often referred to as the conditional probability distribution @xcite ( cpd ) .",
    "a main finding of our study is that consideration solely of the cpds is not sufficient for the boson case at high fractional fillings @xmath19 ; in this case , one needs to calculate even higher - order correlation functions , e.g. , the full @xmath4-point correlation function @xmath20 [ see eq .",

    "the present investigations are also motivated by recent experimental developments , e.g. , the emergence of trapped ultra - cold gas assemblies featuring bosons interacting via a long - range dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we expect the results of this paper to be directly relevant to such systems with a two - body repulsion intermediate between the coulomb and the delta potentials .",
    "additionally , we note the appearance of promising experimental techniques for measuring higher - order correlations in ultra - cold gases employing an atomic hanbury brown - twiss scheme @xcite or shot - noise interferometry @xcite .",
    "experimental realization of few - boson rotating systems can be anticipated in the near future as a result of increasing sophistication of experiments involving periodic optical lattices co - rotating with the gas , which are capable of holding a few atoms in each site .",
    "a natural first step in the study of such systems is the analysis of the physical properties of a few particles confined in a rotating trap with open boundary conditions ( i.e. , conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath21 ) , such as we do here .",

    "while exd calculations for _ bosons _ in the lll have been reported earlier @xcite , the analysis in these studies did not include calculations of the cpds , and consequently formation of rotating boson molecules was not recognized .",

    "requiring a very strong confinement of the harmonic trap along the axis of rotation ( @xmath31 ) , freezes out the many body dynamics in the @xmath32-dimension , and the wavefunction along this direction can be assumed to be permanently in the corresponding oscillator ground state .",
    "we are thus left with an effectively 2d system .",
    "for such a setup , the hamiltonian for @xmath4 atoms of mass @xmath33 in a harmonic trap @xmath34 rotating at angular frequency @xmath35 is given by : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the total angular momentum ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the single - particle position and angular momentum in the @xmath40 plane and @xmath41 is the radial trap frequency .        the hamiltonian can be rewritten in the form , @xmath42 the kinetic part of this hamiltonian is formally equivalent to that of the hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge of an electron ( of charge @xmath43 and mass @xmath44 ) moving in two dimensions under a constant perpendicular magnetic field @xmath7 , if one makes the identification that the cyclotron frequency @xmath45 .",
    "we are now ready to examine our main approximation which is based on two assumptions : ( 1 ) that the rotational frequency @xmath5 is close to that of the confining trap ; in this case the external confinement can be neglected in a first approximation and thus the single - particle spectra are organized in infinitely - degenerate landau levels that are separated by an energy gap of @xmath46 , and ( 2 ) that the interaction strength is so weak that the mixing of landau levels can be ignored .",

    "it has been verified by explicit calculation that this approximation , i.e. , the lowest landau level approximation , is very good for @xmath2 ( low fractional fillings ) , where strong crystalline correlations are most developed , as reported in the present work .",
    "we note , however , that strong correlations beyond the gross - pitaevskii mean field persist in the lll even for @xmath3 ( high fractional fillings ) , as was found via exd calculations for smaller @xmath4 in ref .",
