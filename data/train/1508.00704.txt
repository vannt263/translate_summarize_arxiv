    "the role of eclipsing binaries in nowadays astrophysics is undisputable .",
    "we use the eclipsing binary systems ( hereafter eb ) for the most accurate determination of the stellar masses , radii , as distance indicators , or as classical celestial mechanics laboratories .",
    "we can test the stellar structure models even outside of our galaxy , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "additionally , also the hidden components can be studied via the dedicated observations of particular binaries as well as the dynamical effects in such multiple systems @xcite . due to all of these reasons",
    "the photometric monitoring and analysis of the light curves of selected eclipsing binaries still presents a fruitful contribution to the stellar astrophysics .",
    "on the other hand , the available photometry for many interesting eclipsing binaries exists , but some of these ebs were still not analysed yet . hence",
    ", we decided to use mainly the super wasp photometry @xcite for a light curve analysis and derivation of new minima times for such systems , which were not studied before and their light curve solution is missing .",
    "the selection criteria for the binaries included in our study were the following . only such binaries with known orbital periods",
    "were chosen , having no light curve solution published up to date , have enough data points for the analysis and also have several published times of minima .",
    "the last point was checked via an online archive of minima times observations , a so - called @xmath0 gateway @xcite . due to the very good time coverage provided by the super wasp survey we used this database for the whole analysis of the light curve .",
    "the other databases such as nsvs @xcite , asas @xcite , crts @xcite , or omc @xcite were used only for deriving the times of minima for a subsequent period analysis .",
    "all of the studied systems are the northern - hemisphere stars of moderate brightness ( 10  mag @xmath1 v @xmath1 15  mag ) and with the orbital periods ranging from 0.9 to 6.8 days .    for analysing the light",
    "curves we used the phoebe program @xcite , which is based on the algorithm by @xcite . having sometimes rather limited information about the stars , some of the parameters have to be fixed for the light curve ( hereafter lc ) solution . at first , the `` detached binary '' mode ( in wilson & devinney mode 2 ) was assumed for computing .",
    "the value of the mass ratio @xmath2 was set to 1 .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficients were interpolated from van  hamme s tables ( see @xcite ) , and the linear cosine law was used .",
    "the values of the gravity brightening and bolometric albedo coefficients were set at their suggested values for convective or radiative atmospheres ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the quantities which could be directly calculated from the lc are the following : the relative luminosities @xmath3 , the temperature of the secondary @xmath4 , the inclination @xmath5 , and the kopal s modified potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the synchronicity parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 were also fixed at values of 1 .",
    "the value of the third light @xmath10 was also computed if a non - negligible value resulted from the fitting process . and",
    "finally , the linear ephemerides were calculated using the available minima times for a particular system .    with the final lc analysis",
    ", we also derived many times of minima for a particular system , using a method as presented in .",
    "the template of the lc was used to fit the photometric data from the super wasp as well as from other surveys .",
    "this set of minima times was then combined with the already published minima mostly taken from the @xmath0 gateway @xcite .",
    "the system ei aur ( also gsc 02392 - 00102 ) was discovered by @xcite , who also classified the star as an algol - type .",
    "its orbital period is of about 1.2  days , but there were no light curve or any spectroscopic analysis performed .",
    "we can only roughly estimate its type from the color indices , hence we fixed the primary temperature at a value of 6000  k for the whole fitting process .",
    "the super wasp photometry revealed that it is a detached system , having both minima of roughly equal depths .",
    "therefore , the phoebe code was used to these data and the lc fit is presented in fig .",
    "[ figeiaurlc ] , while the lc parameters are given in table [ tablelc ] .",
    "as one can see , the secondary component has almost the same temperature as the primary , hence there is still a doubt which of the minima is the primary one .",
    "another interesting finding is the fact that relatively large contribution of the third light was detected in the lc solution .",
    "this would naturally explain why both the minima have only so shallow depths .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the star wx  lib is relatively seldom studied system .",
    "it is the southernmost star in our sample , hence it was also observed by the asas survey .",
    "it is also the star with the shortest orbital period in our sample , of about 0.92  days only ( while the gcvs and vsx still presents the period 0.46  days ) .    due to",
    "lacking relevant information about the system , we fixed the primary temperature to the value of 5200  k in agreement with the photometric indices found in various databases .",
    "the lc shows two rather similar and relatively deep eclipses .",
    "the lc solution ( see fig . [ figwxliblc ] and table [ tablelc2 ] ) reveals that both stars are somehow similar , with the primary slightly dominating .",
    "the value of the third light remains negligible .",
    "the period variation was studied using the super wasp as well as the asas , crts , and omc photometric data . because of only very poor coverage of the time interval since its discovery to the nowadays time we are not able to identify any period variation in this time interval .",
    "rz lyn ( also gsc 02995 - 00972 ) is another rather neglected eclipsing binary , briefly studied by @xcite , who classified it as a @xmath11  lyrae type star and giving its correct orbital period of about 1.147  days .",
    "its spectral of a2 type was given by @xcite .",
    "since then only several publications with the times of minima were published .",
    "we carried out an analysis of the lc of this system , using the super wasp photometry .",
    "the results given in table [ tablelc2 ] and the plot in fig . [ figrzlynlc ] show that the system contains one larger component and slightly smaller secondary revolving on mildly inclined orbit .",
    "the amount of the third light is rather negligible .            for the period analysis we collected the already published data from the @xmath0 gateway and combined them with our derived minima times from the super wasp and nsvs photometry .",
    "as one can see from our fig .",
    "[ figrzlynoc ] , the system obviously undergoes a mass transfer between the components .",
    "such an effect is displayed in the @xmath0 diagram as quadratic ephemerides , here in our case the rate is of about @xmath12  days .",
    "the eclipsing binary ty  tri ( also tyc 2312 - 190 - 1 ) was discovered as a variable by @xcite .",
    "no detailed analysis was carried out for this star , only several publications with the times of minima were published during the last decades . for the light curve analysis we fixed the primary temperate at a value of 5720  k , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .            the lc analysis revealed ( see fig .",
    "[ figtytrilc ] and table [ tablelc2 ] ) that here we deal with the most detached system in our sample of stars , but still moving on circular orbit .",
    "we see the system almost exactly edge - on .",
    "the third light was not detected .",
    "the lc solution was used for deriving the minima times ( both from the super wasp as well as from the nsvs photometry ) .",
    "the final plot is given in fig .",
    "[ figtytrioc ] , where we were not able to detect any period variation over the time span of more than 50  years .",
    "the very first lc solution for eight algol - type eclipsing binaries ( based on the super wasp photometry ) led to several interesting results :    * the super wasp survey served as a unique source of photometric data suitable for the lc analysis of many eclipsing binaries never studied before . *",
    "the effects of the second order , like the third light , are also detectable in these data . * for two of the systems ( ei  aur , and bp  dra ) the amount of the third light is so large that these can not easily be considered as pure binaries in any future more detailed study .",
    "* the method of using the light curve templates for deriving the times of minima provides reliable and sufficiently precise minima suitable for a period analysis . * for rz  lyn we found a steady period decrease ( probably due to mass transfer ) , while for two other systems ( xy  dra and vx  lac ) there were detected the third - body period modulations with their respective periods of 18 , and 49 years , respectively .",
    "all of the presented systems were never been studied before concerning their light curves , hence we can consider this study as a good starting point for any other future investigators .",
    "especially , a special focus should be take to these systems , where a larger fraction of the third light was detected and these systems , where a third body variation in the @xmath0 diagram was detected .",
    "based on data from the omc archive at laeff , pre - processed by isdc .",
    "we thank the `` asas '' , `` nsvs '' , `` omc '' , `` crts '' and `` super wasp '' teams for making all of the observations easily public available .",
    "this investigation was supported by the czech science foundation grant no .",
