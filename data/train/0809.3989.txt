    "a particularly interesting feature found in our model of coupled ballistic and diffusive bands is that , through coupling with the `` weak '' diffusive band , there can be additional bound states at the gap edge in the `` strong '' ballistic band .",
    "we find such bound states for an isolated vortex @xcite as well as for the vortex lattice .",
    "in figure  [ dos1 ] the ldos at the vortex centre in the @xmath1 band is plotted as a function of energy @xmath10 for @xmath120 , 0.5 , @xmath144 , @xmath170 , @xmath159 , and @xmath161 ; for ( a ) @xmath134 and ( b ) -0.1 .",
    "we present in figure  [ dos2 ] the ldos for @xmath144 , 5 , @xmath131 , @xmath125 , @xmath159 , and @xmath143 ; for ( a ) @xmath120 and ( b ) 0.5 .",
    "the result for a single ballistic band is also shown in these figures .",
    "the peak at @xmath172 reflects the cdm bound states that arise from repeated andreev scattering from the order parameter in the vortex core . in the core of an isolated vortex in a single clean band ,",
    "the spectrum shows neither coherence peak nor additional bound state at the gap edge . in the vortex lattice , as quasiparticles travel in the periodic pairing potential ,",
    "the continuum energy levels above the energy gap are grouped into bands and van hove singularities appear at the band edges @xcite .",
    "this can be seen clearly for a single ballistic band in figures  [ dos1 ] and [ dos2 ] : in the latter , the band widths are larger due to reduced lattice spacing .    when the ballistic @xmath1 band is coupled with the diffusive @xmath3 band , the vortex core area is enlarged and the periodic pairing potential becomes effectively weaker . as a result ,",
    "band gaps and van hove singularities are reduced as can be seen in figures  [ dos1 ] and [ dos2 ] . at the same time , extra bound states tend to appear at the gap edge .",
    "these features become prominent for larger @xmath107 ( 0.3 vs. 0.5 in figure  [ dos1 ] ) and @xmath116 ( 3 vs. 5 in figure  [ dos2 ] ) , and are more enhanced for negative @xmath109 than for positive @xmath109 ( figure  [ dos1 ] ) . in",
    "most of the examples shown in these figures , the spectrum above the energy gap is more or less continuous . furthermore , in the two - band results presented in figure  [ dos2](b ) , the energy gap is reduced substantially and a band of gap edge bound states is formed .       from the vortex centre for @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath131 , @xmath125 , @xmath143 , for @xmath173 . ]     as a function of distance @xmath149 from the vortex centre for @xmath144 , @xmath131 , @xmath125 , @xmath153 , @xmath143 , for @xmath174 ; ( a ) partial contribution from each band and ( b ) total field distribution .",
    "the @xmath175 that comes into the maxwell equation is taken to be 10 ( @xmath176 for mgb@xmath0 ) . ]    in figure  [ current ] the current densities @xmath177 in the two bands as a function of distance @xmath149 from the vortex centre are shown for @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath131 , @xmath125 , and @xmath143 , for various temperatures .",
    "the current density contribution from the @xmath3 band can be substantial , and even dominating as demonstrated in this figure , for larger @xmath107 and @xmath116 .",
    "as temperature is lowered , the @xmath1-band current density exhibits the kp effect and is more confined around the vortex centre . for stronger coupling of the two bands ,",
    "the kp effect becomes manifest also in the @xmath3 band .",
    "deviation of the magnetic field distribution from the uniform field , @xmath178 , can be obtained from @xmath177 by integrating the maxwell equation , where a parameter @xmath175 comes in . for mgb@xmath0 , @xmath176 .",
    "the @xmath179 as a function of @xmath149 is illustrated in figure  [ field ] for @xmath144 , @xmath131 , @xmath125 , @xmath153 , @xmath143 , and @xmath180 , for @xmath120 and 0.5 . in figure",
    "[ field](a ) partial contribution from each band is shown , while [ field](b ) presents the total field distribution .",
    "it can be seen that when coupling of the two bands is increased , field fluctuations in the @xmath3 band ( hence those in the total field ) are enhanced significantly , while the @xmath1 band contribution hardly changes .       for @xmath120 , @xmath131 , @xmath142 , for ( a ) @xmath144 and ( b ) 5 .",
    "the result for a single clean band is also shown .",
    "the @xmath181 t for mgb@xmath0 . ]    we show in figure  [ phase ] the upper critical field @xmath182 for @xmath147 near @xmath23 for @xmath120 , @xmath131 , and @xmath142 , for ( a ) @xmath144 and ( b ) 5 , along with the result for a single clean band .",
    "although @xmath6 is sensitive to the amount of impurities in the sample , in mgb@xmath0 single crystals , @xmath6 for field parallel to the @xmath5 axis has been measured to be @xmath183 tesla in several experiments @xcite .",
    "this value roughly corresponds to @xmath109 somewhere between -0.1 and 0.1 for @xmath144 , @xmath120 , and @xmath131 in our model . when the @xmath1 band is coupled with the @xmath3 band , @xmath6 is substantially reduced from the single - band value , and decreases further when the coulomb repulsion dominates or the diffusivity increases in the @xmath3 band .",
    "this is consistent with stronger suppression of the order parameter and enlargement of the vortex core area in the @xmath1 band .",
    "furthermore , for relatively large @xmath116 , @xmath182 develops an upward curvature near @xmath23 ( figure  [ phase](b ) ) .",
    "this is interesting in light of the theoretical work based on the eliashberg theory by mansor and carbotte , who studied the effects of fermi velocity anisotropy and impurities on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "their prediction for mgb@xmath0 is that , for field in the @xmath5 direction ( where the fermi velocities in the two bands are assumed to be the same ) , @xmath182 exhibits an upward curvature near @xmath23 when the @xmath3 band is clean and the @xmath1 band is dirty , while it has a quasilinear @xmath147 dependence for the dirty @xmath3 and the clean @xmath1 band ( as observed in several experiments ; see references in ref .",
    "such an upward curvature in @xmath6 ( @xmath184 ) has been observed in some experiments on mgb@xmath0 single crystals @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the effects of induced superconductivity and impurities on the electronic structure in the vortex lattice of a two - band superconductor , in which a `` weak '' 3d diffusive band and a `` strong '' 2d ballistic band are hybridized through the pairing interaction .",
    "we have found that the coulomb repulsion and the diffusivity in the `` weak '' dirty band enhance suppression of the order parameter and enlargement of the vortex core by magnetic field in the `` strong '' clean band . as a result ,",
    "critical temperature and field ( where the order parameter at the vortex unit cell boundary vanishes ) are reduced , and increased diffusivity in the dirty band can result in an upward curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature .",
    "the kramer - pesch effect arising from thermal depopulation of higher - energy core bound states tends to disappear as field becomes stronger and overlap of quasiparticle states of neighbouring vortices increases .",
    "the zero - bias ldos in the diffusive band has a decay length much larger than that in the ballistic band , indicating substantial intervortex transfer of quasiparticles , and the half - decay length increases significantly as the diffusivity increases .",
    "coupling with the `` weak '' diffusive band leads to smearing of energy bands of the vortex lattice and van hove singularities at the band edges in the vortex - core ldos in the `` strong '' ballistic band .",
    "furthermore , bound states tend to appear at the gap edge in the ballistic band , in addition to the well - known caroli - de gennes - matricon bound states .",
    "these effects are enhanced for increased coupling , diffusivity , and coulomb repulsion . finally , the current density contribution in the vortex core and resulting field fluctuations in the diffusive band can be substantial , or even dominating , and exhibit the kramer - pesch effect manifest in the current density when coupling with the ballistic band is strong .",
    "we find the above intriguing features in the quasiparticle spectra for parameter values appropriate for mgb@xmath0 .",
