    "rich clusters of galaxies constitute the extreme high mass end of the cosmic mass distribution function , and study of such rare objects provides unique leverage into theories of structure formation in the universe ( peebles 1983 ) . determining the cosmic evolution of the x - ray luminosity function for the hot gaseous atmospheres of rich clusters can constrain both the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations , and the mean density of the universe ( oukbir and blanchard 1997 , oukbir , bartlett , and blanchard 1997 , henry 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , optical studies of distant clusters can be corrupted by field galaxy contamination ( frenk et al . 1990 ) , while x - ray detections of optically selected clusters have thus far been limited to redshifts less than about one ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 , castander et al .",
    "1994 , nichol et al .",
    "1997 , luppino and gioia 1995 , henry et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "one of the most effective methods for finding galaxies , and possible clusters , at high redshift is to target steep spectrum radio sources with faint optical counter - parts ( mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "until recently the most distant x - ray emitting cluster detected was that associated with the radio galaxy 3c 295 at z = 0.461 ( henry and henriksen 1986 ) , and the three most distant x - ray cluster candidates currently known are all associated with powerful radio sources at z @xmath5 1 ( crawford and fabian 1993 , crawford and fabian 1995 , dickinson 1997 ) .    the radio source 1138@xmath0262 has been identified with a narrow emission line galaxy at redshift 2.156 ( pentericci et al .",
    "1997 , mccarthy et al .",
    "this radio galaxy is remarkable for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the optical continuum morphology is comprised of many blue ` knots ' of emission , distributed over an area of about 100 kpc ( figure 1 ) .",
    "= 50 km sec@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath6 = 0.5 . ]",
    "the ly@xmath7 emission shows similar clumpy structure on a similar scale .",
    "second , the radio source has the most disturbed morphology of any z @xmath8 2 radio galaxy yet identified , indicating strong interaction between the radio jet and the ambient medium . and",
    "third radio continuum polarimetric imaging of 1138@xmath0262 reveals the largest values of faraday rotation for any radio galaxy at z @xmath9 2 ( carilli et al . 1997 ) , with rotation measures as high as 6250 rad m@xmath10 .",
    "such large rotation measures are characteristic of nearby radio galaxies in dense cluster atmospheres ( carilli et al . 1996 , taylor , ge , and barton 1994 ) .",
    "all these data provide strong , although circumstantial , evidence that the 1138@xmath0262 radio source is in a dense environment , perhaps a hot , cluster - type atmosphere . to test this hypothesis we observed 1138@xmath0262 with the high resolution imager on the rosat x - ray satellite .",
    "we observed 1138@xmath0262 with the high resolution imager on the rosat x - ray satellite ( trmper 1983 ) for 18 ksec on july 13 , 1996 , and for 23 ksec on june 11 , 1997 .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf - pros data reduction software at sao , and the aips software at nrao .",
    "the images from each epoch were registered using four ` background ' x - ray sources within 9@xmath11 of the target source .",
    "we estimate this relative registration is accurate to about 1@xmath12 . the absolute astrometry was determined using the x - ray and optical star , hd101551 , located 9@xmath11 northwest of the target source .",
    "this astrometry was checked using two other x - ray - optical coincidences in the field . from these",
    "we estimate a relative optical - to - x - ray astrometric accuracy of about 3@xmath12 .",
    "the rosat observations shows a clear detection of an x - ray source close to the position of the radio and optical nucleus of 1138@xmath0262 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the separation between the x - ray peak and optical nucleus is 2@xmath12 , which is smaller than the astrometric accuracy .",
    "a total of 52 hri counts were obtained in the optimum detection cell of 21@xmath12 ( see below ) , and the average background in the source vicinity was 21 counts . hence in the 41 ksec observation the average net hri count rate from 1138@xmath0262 was 0.75@xmath10.16 counts ksec@xmath4 .    an important question concerning the x - ray emission from 1138@xmath0262 is whether the emission is spatially extended ? we have addressed this question in a number of ways using the three brightest ` background ' sources within 6@xmath11 of 1138@xmath0262 for comparison .",
    "first , we fitted an elliptical gaussian function to the observed brightness distributions of 1138@xmath0262 , and to the background sources .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "columns 2 and 3 list the ( deconvolved ) full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) values , and the position angle of the major axis .",
    "second , we determined the fwhm for the gaussian smoothing function which optimizes the detection probability according to poisson statistics .",
    "the fwhm values are listed in column 4 of table 1 , while column 5 lists the net counts . in all cases",
    "the size parameters for 1138@xmath0262 are larger than those of the background sources , although in the case of the source 5.9@xmath11 to the east of 1138@xmath0262 the differences are within the errors . and third , we calculated the average count rate per 1@xmath12 cell in a series of concentric annuli centered on the position of each source .",
    "the resulting radial profiles are shown in figure 3 .",
    "two of the sources appear to be marginally smaller than 1138@xmath0262 , again with the exception of the source 5.9@xmath11 to the east .",
    "overall , the values in the table , and the radial profiles , suggest that the x - ray emission from 1138@xmath0262 may be more extended than that from the background sources , although in some cases the differences are less than the errors .",
    "the hri provides no information on the x - ray spectrum of 1138@xmath0262 . in order to estimate the total x - ray luminosity from 1138@xmath0262 ,",
    "we adopt two different spectral models .",
    "the first model is a thermal spectrum with the same parameters as those determined for the x - ray emitting cluster atmosphere enveloping the low redshift radio galaxy cygnus a :   kt = 7 kev and abundance = 30@xmath13 solar ( reynolds and fabian 1996 , ueno et al .",
    "cygnus a was the first extreme rotation measure radio source identified ( dreher et al .",
    "1987 ) , and cygnus a has a similar radio luminosity to 1138@xmath0262 . the implied x - ray luminosity for 1138@xmath0262 is 6.7@xmath11.3@xmath210@xmath3 ergs sec@xmath4 for emitted energies between 2 kev and 10 kev . for comparison ,",
    "the luminosity for the cygnus a cluster in this band is 1.6@xmath210@xmath14 ergs sec@xmath4 .",
    "the second model is a power - law with an energy index @xmath15 , for which the x - ray luminosity is 7.2@xmath11.4@xmath210@xmath3 ergs sec@xmath4 .",
    "reynolds and fabian ( 1996 ) present a detailed deprojection analysis of the cluster x - ray emission from cygnus a. they assume a cluster core diameter of 300 kpc , and derive a density and pressure in the gas at the core radius of 0.01 @xmath16 and 1.4@xmath210@xmath17 dyn cm@xmath10 , respectively , a total gravitational mass of 3@xmath210@xmath19 m@xmath20 , and a total gas mass of 4@xmath210@xmath21 m@xmath20 . for lack of better information we will assume in the analysis below that ,",
    "if 1138@xmath0262 is an x - ray cluster , then the reynolds and fabian numbers for cygnus a are representative of the 1138@xmath0262 environment .",
    "the x - ray emission from the cygnus a cluster has a total extent of about 1 mpc , with about half the emission coming from the high surface brightness cluster core . for 1138@xmath0262",
    "the optimum detection cell of 21@xmath12 corresponds to a physical scale of 170 kpc , comparable to the expected cluster core diameter .",
    "it may be that , due to cosmological surface brightness dimming , our hri image of 1138@xmath0262 delineates only the higher surface brightness regions , while the low surface brightness emission is lost in the background . in general , cosmological dimming will favor detection of clusters with peaked x - ray surface brightness profiles at high redshift",
    "is the x - ray emission from 1138@xmath0262 from a hot cluster atmosphere , or from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ?",
    "a critical criterion is the spatial extent of the x - ray emission .",
    "unfortunately , given the results on background sources in the field , and the paucity of photons from 1138@xmath0262 , the current data is inconclusive on this issue .",
    "there is much external , circumstantial , evidence for a dense environment for 1138@xmath0262 .",
    "first , the very distorted radio morphology suggests a series of strong jet - cloud collisions occurring over scales @xmath5 100 kpc .",
    "such interaction is supported by optical spectroscopy , showing large velocities , and velocity dispersions , for the line emitting gas in regions associated with the brightest radio knots ( pentericci et al .",
    "second , the optical morphology consists of many blue knots of emission , with sizes between 5 and 10 kpc , again distributed over @xmath5 100 kpc ( pentericci et al . 1998 ) .",
    "pentericci et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpret this distribution as a group of star forming galaxies in the act of merging into a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "this clumpy morphology is also seen for the ly @xmath7 emitting gas , and the major axis of the optical line and continuum emission is roughly aligned with that of the radio source . and third , 1138@xmath0262 shows the most extreme values of faraday rotation for any galaxy at z @xmath9 2 ( carilli et al .",
    "observations of lower redshift radio galaxies have shown a correlation between large rotation measures and cluster environment : all sources located at the centers of dense , x - ray emitting cluster atmospheres show large amounts of faraday rotation ( taylor et al .",
    "an important point is that this correlation is independent of radio source luminosity and morphological class , and hence is most likely a probe of cluster properties , and not radio source properties .",
    "the implication is that the hot cluster gas must be substantially magnetized , with field strengths of order a few @xmath22 g ( carilli et al . 1996 ) .",
    "worrall et al . (",
    "1994 ) have found a correlation between the radio and x - ray emission from the nuclei of luminous , nucleus - dominated , radio loud quasars , from which they conclude that the dominant x - ray emission component is relativistically beamed synchrotron radiation ( see also siebert et al .",
    "the radio nucleus of 1138@xmath0262 has a flux density at 5 ghz of :   s@xmath23 = 3.7 mjy . applying the relationship from worrall et al .",
    "then predicts an x - ray flux density of :   s@xmath24 = 4@xmath210@xmath25 @xmath22jy .",
    "the observed value is a factor 40 larger :   s@xmath26 = 1.5@xmath210@xmath10 @xmath22jy .",
    "worrall et al . also find that many lobe dominated quasars fall above the nuclear x - ray - to - radio relationship defined by the nucleus - dominated quasars ( in terms of x - ray flux density ) by about the same factor as that seen for 1138@xmath0262 , although the scatter is large .",
    "they hypothesize the existence of an extra ( unknown ) x - ray emission component in some sources . in the case of 1138@xmath0262",
    "we would argue that this excess is likely to be thermal emission from a hot cluster atmosphere .",
    "the worrall et al .",
    "relationships apply to broad emission line quasars , while 1138@xmath0262 is a narrow emission line galaxy .",
    "perhaps a better comparison is made with the ultra - luminous narrow line radio galaxies cygnus a and 3c 295 , which have radio and x - ray luminosities similar to 1138@xmath0262 ( p@xmath27 @xmath9 3x10@xmath28 ergs sec@xmath4 hz@xmath4 , l@xmath29 @xmath5 10@xmath14 ergs sec@xmath4 )",
    ". the non - thermal emission from the active nucleus of cygnus a contributes at most 20@xmath13 to the total observed x - ray flux between 2 kev and 10 kev ( ueno et al .",
    "1994 ) . for 3c 295 ,",
    "the point source contribution to the total observed einstein hri flux is less than 13@xmath13 ( henry and henriksen 1986 ) .",
    "a similar result has been obtained for the ultra - luminous radio galaxy 3c 324 at z = 1.2 , which has an associated x - ray emitting cluster with size and luminosity similar to 1138@xmath0262 , with no evidence of an x - ray point source in the rosat hri image ( dickinson 1997 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the increased confinement of radio lobes provided by a dense local environment may enhance the conversion efficiency of jet kinetic energy into radio luminosity , thereby leading to a logical association between ultra - luminous radio galaxies and dense cluster atmospheres ( barthel and arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "one complication in the interpretation of 1138@xmath0262 which might argue for a significant agn component is that near infrared imaging of 1138@xmath0262 has revealed a bright , small source coincident with the radio nucleus , with k = 16 ( pentericci et al .",
    "this source is two magnitudes brighter than predicted by the hubble k - z relationship for luminous radio galaxies ( mccarthy 1993 ) , perhaps suggesting that 1138@xmath0262 is a steep spectrum radio loud quasar in which the optical nucleus is obscured by dust .",
    "however , pentericci et al . ( 1997 ) have shown that this k band source can be reasonably fit with a devaucouleur s law with a scale length of 2@xmath12 ( @xmath5 20 kpc ) , consistent with a bright elliptical galaxy , and significantly larger than the excellent seeing during the k band observations ( seeing fwhm @xmath5 0.6@xmath12 ) .",
    "pentericci et al .",
    "set a conservative upper limit to the point source contribution in their image of 20@xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , their k band image may be contaminated by line emission ( h@xmath7 and [ nii ] ) , which could bias the results depending on the relative distribution of the line and continuum emission .",
    "the distorted jet - like morphology of the 1138@xmath0262 radio source could also be construed as being more similar to steep spectrum radio loud quasars than to most radio galaxies .",
    "systematically more disturbed morphologies in quasars relative to radio galaxies are thought to arise from a combination of projection ( ie .",
    "jet axis not far from our line of sight ) , and relativistic beaming ( barthel and miley 1988 ) .",
    "a counter argument is that 1138@xmath0262 does not have a prominent radio nucleus .",
    "the nuclear fraction for 1138@xmath0262 extrapolated to a rest frame frequency of 2.3 ghz is 0.4@xmath13 ( assuming the core is flat spectrum below 5 ghz ) .",
    "this fraction is comparable to values seen for luminous narrow line radio galaxies ( typically @xmath5 0.3@xmath13 ) , but is considerably below values seen for broad line radio galaxies ( typically @xmath5 3@xmath13 ) , and steep spectrum radio loud quasars ( typically @xmath5 50@xmath13 ) , although the scatter in the values for each type of source is large ( morganti et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "overall , the optical , radio , and x - ray data all favor a hot cluster gas origin for the x - rays from 1138@xmath0262 , however we can not preclude an agn contribution . if the emission is dominated by the agn , then the extreme rotation measures remain unexplained , and 1138@xmath0262 would be very unusual among narrow line radio galaxies in terms of the relative radio and x - ray properties of its nucleus .",
    "we proceed under the assumption that the x - ray emission from 1138@xmath0262 is from a hot cluster atmosphere at z = 2.156 , and we speculate on possible physical implications .",
    "first , the over - density at which a structure is thought to separate from the general expansion of the universe , @xmath30 , and collapse under its own self - gravity is :   @xmath30 = @xmath31 @xmath2 @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is the mean cosmic mass density :   @xmath32 = 7.5@xmath210@xmath33@xmath2@xmath34@xmath2(1+z)@xmath35 gm @xmath16 ( peebles 1993 ) . at a redshift of 2.2",
    "this becomes : @xmath30(z=2.2 ) = 2.5@xmath210@xmath33@xmath2@xmath34 gm @xmath16 .",
    "the density of a typical x - ray cluster is :   few@xmath210@xmath33 gm @xmath16",
    "@xmath5 @xmath30(z=2.2 ) for @xmath34 = 1 ( eg .",
    "mass @xmath5 10@xmath19 m@xmath20 , size @xmath5 1 mpc ) .",
    "hence , any large scale structure observed at z @xmath9 2 must be dynamically young , having just separated from the general expansion of the universe .",
    "alternatively , massive structures at large redshift might indicate an open universe ( @xmath34 @xmath36 1 ) .",
    "second , the existence of a hot cluster - type atmosphere at high redshift would argue for shock heated , primordial in - fall as the origin of the cluster gas , rather than ejecta from cluster galaxies ( sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "such a model would require an early epoch of star formation in order to supply the metals observed in the associated optical nebulosity ( ostriker and gnedin 1996 ) .",
    "third , the large rotation measures observed raise the question of the origin of cluster magnetic fields at early epochs",
    ". one possible mechanism is amplification of seed fields by a turbulent dynamo operating during the formation process of the cluster as driven by successive accretion events ( loeb and mao 1994 ) .",
    "the timescale for field generation would then be a few times the cluster dynamical timescale , or a few@xmath210@xmath37 years .",
    "lastly , these observations would then verify the technique of using extreme rotation measure sources as targets for searches for cluster x - ray emission at high redshift .",
    "thus far there have been a total of 11 radio galaxies at z @xmath8 2 with source frame rotation measures greater than 1000 rad m@xmath10 , the most distant being at z = 3.8 ( carilli et al .",
