    "the singularity confinement method has been proposed by grammaticos , ramani and papageorgiou @xcite as a criterion for the integrability of ( finite or infinite dimensional ) discrete dynamical systems .",
    "the singularity confinement method demands that even if singularities would appear due to particular initial values , such singularities have to disappear after a finite number of iteration steps and that the information on the initial values can be recovered ( hence the dynamical system has to be invertible ) .",
    "however `` counter examples '' were found by hietarinta and viallet @xcite .",
    "these mappings satisfy the singularity confinement criterion , but the orbits of their solutions exhibit chaotic behavior .",
    "the authors of @xcite introduced the notion of algebraic entropy in order to test the degree of complexity of successive iterations .",
    "the algebraic entropy is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the degree of @xmath2th iterate .",
    "this notion is linked with arnold s complexity , since the degree of a mapping gives the intersection number of the image of a line and a hyperplane .",
    "while the degree grows exponentially for a generic mapping , it was shown that it grows only in the polynomial order for a large class of integrable mappings @xcite .",
    "many discrete painlev equations were found by ramani , grammaticos , hietarinta , jimbo and sakai @xcite and have been extensively studied .",
    "recently it was shown by sakai @xcite that all of these ( from the point of view of symmetries ) are obtained by studying rational surfaces in connection with the extended affine weyl groups .",
    "surfaces obtained by successive blow - ups @xcite of @xmath3 or @xmath4 have been studied by several authors in the theory of birational mappings with invariants of finite ( @xmath5 in the case of @xmath3 and @xmath6 in the case of @xmath4 , @xmath7 ) point sets in a rational surface connected to the weyl groups @xcite .",
    "looijenga @xcite and sakai studied the case of @xmath8 , in which case the birational mappings are connected with the extended affine weyl groups and are obtained as cremona transformations .",
    "discrete painlev equations are recovered as particular cases .",
    "our aim in this letter is to characterize one of the mappings found by hietarinta and viallet from the point of view of the theory of rational surfaces . as its space of initial values",
    ", we obtain a rational surface associated with some root system of indefinite type . conversely we recover the mapping from the surface and",
    "consequently obtain an extension of mapping to its non - autonomous version . by considering the intersection numbers of divisors ,",
    "we also present a method to calculate the algebraic entropy of a mapping .",
    "it is shown that the degree of the mapping is given by the @xmath2th power of a matrix which is given by the action of the mapping on the picard group .",
    "we consider the dynamical system written by the birational map @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a nonzero constant .",
    "this equation was found by hietarinta and viallet @xcite and we call it the hv eq .. to test the singularity confinement , let us assume @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14",
    ". with these initial values singularities appear at @xmath15 as @xmath16 and disappear at @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the information on the initial values is hidden in the coefficients of higher degree @xmath18 . however , taking suitable rational functions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 we can find the information of the initial values as finite values .",
    "the fact that the leading orders of @xmath21 and @xmath22 become @xmath23 and @xmath24 actually suggests that the hv eq . can be lifted to an automorphism of a suitable rational surface .",
    "although of course these rational functions are not uniquely determined .",

    "we consider the inverse mapping of the hv eq .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 means the image of @xmath31 by the mapping .",
    "this mapping has two indeterminate points : @xmath32 .",
    "we denote blowing up at @xmath33 : by @xmath34 by blowing up at @xmath35 , @xmath36 takes meaning at this point .",
    "first we blow - up at @xmath37 , @xmath38 and denote the obtained surface by @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 is lifted to a rational mapping from @xmath39 to @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in the new coordinates @xmath40 is expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this maps the exceptional curve at @xmath44 almost to @xmath45 but has an indeterminate point on the exceptional curve : @xmath46 hence we have to blow - up again at this point . in general",
    "it is known that , if there is a rational mapping @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are smooth projective algebraic varieties , the procedure of blowing up can be completed in a finite number of steps , after which one obtains a smooth projective algebraic variety @xmath50 such that the rational mapping is lifted to a regular mapping from @xmath50 to @xmath49 ( theorem of the elimination of indeterminacy @xcite ) .    here",
    "we obtain the following sequence of blow - ups .",
    "( for simplicity we take only one coordinate of ( [ coblow ] ) . )",
    "@xmath51 where the @xmath52 mean the total transforms generated by the blow - ups .",
    "of course the sequence above is not unique , since there is freedom to choose the coordinates .",
    "we have obtained a mapping from @xmath50 to @xmath4 which is lifted from @xmath40 .",
    "but our aim is to construct a rational surface @xmath48 such that @xmath40 is lifted to an automorphism of @xmath48 .",
    "if it can be achieved , @xmath48 is considered to be the space of initial values in the sense of okamoto @xcite , where a sequence of rational surfaces @xmath53 is ( or @xmath53 themselves are ) called the space of initial values for a sequence of rational mappings @xmath54 if each @xmath54 is lifted to an isomorphism from @xmath53 to @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "first we construct the rational surface @xmath57 such that @xmath40 is lifted to a regular mapping from @xmath57 to @xmath58 for this purpose it is sufficient to eliminate the indeterminacy of mapping from @xmath50 to @xmath50 .",
    "consequently we obtain @xmath57 defined by the following sequence of blow - ups .",
