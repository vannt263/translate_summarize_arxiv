    "in 1972 baxter @xcite invented a method to compute the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the eight vertex model without first computing the eigenvectors .",
    "this was done by introducing an `` auxiliary '' matrix @xmath2 which satisfies the functional equation @xmath3^nq(v-2\\eta)+[h(v-\\eta)]^nq(v+2\\eta ) \\label{tq}\\ ] ] with @xmath4 where the quasiperiodic theta functions @xmath5 and the transfer matrix @xmath6 of the eight vertex model are defined in appendix 1 .",
    "the number of lattice sites of the chain with periodic boundary conditions is @xmath0 and @xmath2 satisfies the commutation relations @xmath7=0\\label{tqcomm}\\\\ & & [ q(v),q(v')]=0\\label{qqcomm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation ( [ tq ] ) is obviously a matrix equation .",
    "however , the commutation relations ( [ tqcomm ] ) and ( [ qqcomm ] ) allow all four matrices in ( [ tq ] ) to be simultaneously diagonalized and thus the equation also may be regarded as a scalar functional equation for eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the matrices @xmath6 and @xmath2 .    for any eigenvalue @xmath8 the scalar tq equation may be considered to be a second order difference equation for @xmath9 .",
    "however , it is important to recognize that in addition to the scalar tq equation quasi - periodicity properties must be independently specified for the functions @xmath9 in order to obtain explicit solutions and that , as explicitly demonstrated for the eight vertex model in @xcite , the solutions @xmath9 to the scalar tq equation do not have to satisfy the same quasi periodicity conditions which are satisfied by the transfer matrix eigenvalues @xmath8 .",
    "this difference in quasi - periodicity properties of @xmath8 and @xmath9 has recently been studied in @xcite .",
    "the importance of this is that there are many models such as the sos @xcite @xcite and rsos @xcite models for which the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix have been shown to satisfy the scalar tq equation but an operator @xmath2 which satisfies a matrix tq equation is not known .",
    "it is therefore most interesting the ask the following question :    _ what additional information is contained in a q matrix which is not contained in the scalar tq equation supplemented by the quasiperiodicity properties of the eigenvalues @xmath9 ? _",
    "this question is particularly relevant to the eight vertex model where the matrices constructed by baxter in 1972 @xcite and in 1973 @xcite have been shown @xcite to be different .",
    "this lack of uniqueness occurs for the eight vertex model when the transfer matrix has degenerate eigenvalues which occur when the parameter @xmath10 satisfies the `` root of unity '' condition imposed in the 1972 paper @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind of modulus @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integers whose greatest common divisor is one .",
    "more generally the relation between quasiperiodicity and non - uniqueness of the solutions to the scalar tq equation has been extensively investigated by bazhanov and mangazeev @xcite for the special case of @xmath16 .",
    "we have studied the non - uniqueness of @xmath1 matrices for the eight vertex model at various roots of unity ( [ root ] ) in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite and in @xcite and @xcite we have seen that there are cases of the root of unity condition ( [ root ] ) where by use of the methods of @xcite two different matrices may be constructed , which we call @xmath17 and @xmath18 , that are distinct from the matrix @xmath19 constructed by baxter @xcite .",
    "one of the distinguishing features is that for different classes of the integers @xmath20 and @xmath15 the three matrices may have different commutation relations with the three discrete symmetry operators @xmath21 and @xmath22    a second most important property of @xmath2 matrices which goes beyond the quasiperiodicity properties of the eigenvalues was presented in @xcite where it was conjectured that the matrix @xmath17 satisfies a functional equation not involving @xmath6 .",
    "this equation is specific to the specific matrix @xmath17 and is not a consequence of the scalar tq equation and the quasiperiodicity properties of the eigenvalues of @xmath17 .",
    "this functional equation is completely analogous to the functional equation first found for the three state chiral potts model @xcite .",
    "this analogue between the q matrix of the eight vertex model and the transfer matrix of the chiral potts model is presented in great generality in the 1990 paper of baxter , bazhanov and perk @xcite .",
    "however it is only the matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 for which this analogy will hold because no such functional equation holds for @xmath19 .",
    "the purpose of this present paper is to extend the studies of @xcite-@xcite in two ways .",
    "the first is to demonstrate that the matrix @xmath18 which was studied in @xcite for the case @xmath20 and @xmath15 both even may be extended to all integer values of @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",
    "the second is to exhibit conjectured functional equations for all cases of the matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in sec .",
    "2 we formulate the problem and summarize the results .",
    "the details of the construction of @xmath18 for @xmath20 and @xmath15 not both even are given in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "4 with a discussion of our results and a few open questions .",
    "the construction devised by baxter in 1972 @xcite to find matrices @xmath2 which satisfy ( [ tq ] ) as summarized in @xcite consists of three steps :    \\1 ) the construction of matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 which satisfy @xmath25^nq_r(v-2\\eta ) + \\omega^{n}[h(v-\\eta)]^nq_r(v+2\\eta)\\label{tqr}\\\\ & & q_l(v)t(v)=\\omega^{-n}[h(v+\\eta)]^nq_l(v-2\\eta ) + \\omega^{n}[h(v-\\eta)]^nq_l(v+2\\eta)\\label{tql}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is some phase ( possibly equal to unity ) and @xmath27 are of the form @xmath28 \\label{trs}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are matrices of some dimension @xmath30 and @xmath31    \\2 ) the establishing of interchange relations @xmath32 where there are four values of @xmath33 to be considered @xmath34    \\3 ) the construction of @xmath35 from @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a value of the spectral parameter @xmath38 such that @xmath39 is nonsingular .",
    "whenever the interchange relation ( [ interchange ] ) holds for two different matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 the matrix @xmath35 will satisfy @xmath42=0 \\label{qaacomm}\\ ] ]    the establishing of these three conditions is sufficient to prove that the @xmath2 so defined will satisfy the commutation relations ( [ tqcomm ] ) and ( [ qqcomm ] ) and the @xmath43 equation ( [ tq ] ) with the extra phase @xmath26 . if we set @xmath44 then @xmath45 will satisfy ( [ tq ] ) which has no phase factor @xmath26 and it is obvious that @xmath46 will continue to satisfy the commutation relations ( [ tqcomm ] ) and ( [ qqcomm ] ) .",
    "there are two choices for the matrices @xmath47 which have been found to satisfy the requirements of steps 1 - 3 .",
    "the first is the choice originally made by baxter in 1972 @xcite where the only non zero elements are @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the dimension @xmath50 is the @xmath51 of ( [ root ] ) .",
    "this choice is valid for all @xmath0 .    the other choice , first found in @xcite is valid only for @xmath0 even ( because the trace in ( [ trs ] ) vanishes identically for odd @xmath0 ) .",
    "this choice is given for @xmath52 by @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 defined for @xmath52 by @xmath56 and @xmath57 where the dimension @xmath50 depends on @xmath51 and the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 are arbitrary .",
    "the interchange relation ( [ interchange ] ) will hold only when the parameter @xmath60 takes on certain specific values .",
    "we note that @xmath61    we demonstrated in @xcite that there are three subcases of the root of unity condition ( [ root ] ) where @xmath17 satisfies steps 1 - 3 ; @xmath62 furthermore in @xcite we demonstrated for case of @xmath20 and @xmath15 both even where @xmath17 does not exist that @xmath18 does satisfy steps 1 - 3 for the two cases of @xmath63 and @xmath64 and in addition when @xmath64 that there are four subcases according to @xmath65    in this paper we show that the construction of @xmath18 of @xcite with @xmath63 may be extended to the cases @xmath20 and @xmath15 not both even .",
    "to achieve this generalization we need to allow the dimension @xmath50 of the matrices @xmath66 to be a multiple of the @xmath51 defined by ( [ root ] ) .",
    "thus if we rewrite ( [ root ] ) as @xmath67 where now @xmath68 and @xmath69 are allowed to have common divisors .",
    "we find that steps 1 - 3 are satisfied when @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as shown in table [ tab:2 ]    .relation between the parameters occurring in ( [ root ] ) and ( [ root2 ] ) .",

    "this consistency obtains only for certain values of @xmath60 and the cases of @xmath50 even and odd must be treated separately .",

    "the studies of q matrices , beginning with @xcite,@xcite and continuing through @xcite-@xcite have revealed that the concept of a q matrix is not unique and that for a full understanding it is necessary to study several essentially different constructions .",
    "for example the construction 1973 @xcite exists for generic @xmath10 for an even number of sites and commutes with both symmetry operators @xmath115 and @xmath121 but is of limited use in determining the degeneracy of the transfer matrix eigenvalues at roots of unity .",

    "<S> we show in this paper that a new q matrix , which has recently been introduced and is non zero only for @xmath0 even , exists for all roots of unity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we consider the relations between all of the known @xmath1 matrices of the eight vertex model and conjecture functional equations for them .    </S>",
