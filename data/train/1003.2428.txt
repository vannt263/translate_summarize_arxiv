    "the subject of optical bistability @xcite , to which lorenzo narducci contributed greatly during his prime years of life , was brought to spotlight again by recent experimental demonstration of optical bistability in a microcavity with a cavity field at the level of a single photon @xcite .  instead of thermal gases , as typically employed by lorenzo s generation , where the thermal de broglie s wavelength of the particles is far smaller than the interparticle spacing , more recent trend in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) focuses on cavity systems with ultracold quantum gases @xcite , opening the door to studies such as cavity - mediated bistable mott - insulator to superfluid phase transition @xcite , where the particle statistical nature becomes an essential feature of the cavity problem .",
    "in contrast to 1980s , when the surge of interest in optical bistability was inspired by the prospect of its use as a switch in an all - optical computer @xcite , the current surge of interest in the same topic was , however , motivated largely by the equivalence of the cavity condensate system @xcite to the cavity opto - mechanical system @xcite .",
    "the study of the latter falls into the realm of cavity optomechanics , a rapidly emerging field which aims to use the cavity - assisted radiation force @xcite to cool mechanical device , ranging from nano- or micro - mechanical cantilevers to macroscopic mirrors in ligo project , down ultimately to their quantum mechanical ground state @xcite .",
    "[ ptb ]    schematics.ps    in this paper , we focus on a cavity system containing a coupled homonuclear atom - molecule condensate as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : schematic ] .  in the absence of the cavity , molecular state @xmath0",
    "is coupled only to free atomic state @xmath1 by an intraspecies feshbach resonance @xcite characterized with a strength @xmath2 and a detuning @xmath3 [ the shaded part in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](a ) ] .  in the cavity qed setting ,",
    "state @xmath4 is coupled , besides to state @xmath1 , also to excited molecular state @xmath5 by a unidirectional ring cavity of a total length @xmath6 .",
    "the cavity is driven by an external laser of wavenumber @xmath7 , polarization @xmath8 , and frequency @xmath9 , which is tuned far away from the @xmath10 molecular transition .",
    "in addition , the cavity is assumed to possess a sufficiently large intermode spacing @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 being the light speed in vacuum ) so that only the cavity mode with a longitudinal mode frequency @xmath13 closest to @xmath9 is relevant to our study , where @xmath14 equals integer multiple of @xmath15 .",
    "further , the cavity mode is assumed to overlap with the condensate in a spatial region , characterized with a length @xmath16 and a cross - sectional area @xmath17 , large enough so that the condensate can be treated as a uniform system with an effective volume @xmath18 and a total atom number @xmath19 ( counting those in molecules ) .",
    "a similar cavity + condensate system has recently been studied @xcite , in which atoms are converted into molecules by photoassociation as opposed to magnetoassociation ( feshbach resonance ) in our model .  there ,",
    "absorption of a cavity photon will convert two atoms into a molecule , and emission of a cavity photon will dissociate two atoms into a  molecule .",
    "this is reminiscent of the absorptive bistability in a driven optical cavity containing an ensemble of two - level atoms .",
    "in contrast , the cavity field in our model is to introduce a phase shift to the molecular field , not the population exchange between atoms and molecules .  as a result ,",
    "the bistability in our model is of dispersive nature .",
    "further , interaction between electronic dipoles and a cavity field in ref .",
    "@xcite gives rise to atom - molecule coupling , which , since the cavity field is itself a dynamical variable , changes with time .",
    "in contrast , in our model , it is the hyperfine interaction - the coupling between electron spins and nuclear spins of two colliding atoms that result in atom - molecule coupling , which is therefore fixed by the atomic internal structure , independent of cavity field .  in this respect ,",
    "our model is analogous more closely to a cavity system with a spin-1 condensate ( also recently proposed @xcite ) than to a cavity system with photoassociation @xcite ; atom exchanges among different internal states in the spin-1 condensate are accomplished by spin - exchange interaction , which is also independent of cavity field .",
    "the interest in feshbach resonance stems primarily from its use as an effective tool to coherently create molecular becs from the existing atomic becs .  in a typical experiment ,",
    "conversion of atomic becs into molecular becs is carried out by ramping the feshbach detuning across the resonance .",
    "this method relies on the existence of a mixed ( or dressed ) atom - molecule state @xcite , and the ability of this state to change its composition from predominantly atomic to predominantly molecular species when the feshbach detuning @xmath3 is tuned from above to bellow the resonance .",
    "the question that we want to pursue , in this paper , is how the molecular population in state @xmath0 can be made to vary with the feshbach detuning in a bistable fashion , instead of monotonously as in typical situations .",
    "a bistable crossover adds new meaning to the feshbach resonance : whether the system is in the atomic or molecular extreme is determined not only by the feshbach detuning but also by the history of the system .     to this end ,",
    "we first formulate , in sec .",
    "ii , a semiclassical mean - field description of our model in the limit where both the excited molecular field and the optical cavity field can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "we then explore the matter - wave bistability due to the two - body s - wave collisions in sec .",
    "iii a and that due to the cavity - mediated effective interaction between two feshbach molecules in sec .",
    "iii b.  finally , we provide a summary in sec . iv .",
    "in this section , we take a semiclassical approach , in which optical fields are treated classically while matter fields are treated quantum mechanically , to formulate a theoretical description of the proposed cavity + condensate system .",
    "this is the same approach that lorenzo embraced in many of his works @xcite , except that quantization is now performed at a level for a many - body system , instead of a single - body system as in  a typical semiclassical laser theory .  to begin with ,",
    "we expand optical field @xmath20 in terms of the slowly varying amplitude @xmath21 in space @xmath22 and time @xmath23 according to @xmath24 and matter field @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 according to@xmath27   , \\label{psifield}%\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes the operator in momentum space for annihilating a bosonic particle in state @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the total atom number density .  the expansion in eq .",

    "is then described by the following hamiltonian @xmath32 where repeated indices are to be summed from 1 to 2 .  in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , the first line describes the feshbach resonance of strength @xmath2 , the second line the s - wave collisions of strength @xmath33 @xmath34 between states @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the last line the part of hamiltonian involving excited state @xmath5 . in the last line ,",
    "the first term denotes the energy of state @xmath37 in the rotating frame , where @xmath38 is the laser detuning , and the second term stands for the laser - induced electric dipole interaction , where @xmath39 is the rabi frequency , @xmath40 the matrix element , and @xmath41 the electric dipole moment operator .",
    "finally , collisions involving the final excited state @xmath5 are ignored since state @xmath5 remains virtually empty in our model .",
    "an important concept in the semiclassical approach is the macroscopic polarization defined as @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "this polarization is found , when the use of both eq .",

    "( [ e]),@xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the slowly varying part of the polarization .",
    "the evolution of the optical field is then governed by the maxwell s equation , which , under the slowly varying envelope approximation , takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 is the magnetic ( electric ) permeability in vacuum .",
    "equation ( [ maxwell ] ) clearly shows that polarization plays the role of a bridge between the classical optical field in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) and the quantum matter fields in eq .",
    "( [ psifield ] ) .",
    "the final component in the semiclassical approach pertaining to any qed problems is the boundary condition , which , in our case and under the assumption that both input and output mirrors  have the same reflectivity @xmath49 ( transmissivity @xmath50 ) , can be cast into the form @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the scaled amplitude of the incident field , @xmath53 the transit free propagation time inside the cavity , and @xmath54 the cavity mode frequency detuning .",

    "<S> a coupled atom - molecule condensate with an intraspecies feshbach resonance is employed to explore matter wave bistability both in the presence and in the absence of a unidirectional optical ring cavity . in particular , a set of conditions are derived that allow the threshold for bistability , due both to two - body s - wave scatterings and to cavity - mediated two - body interactions , to be determined analytically .  </S>",
    "<S> the latter bistability is found to support , not only transitions between a mixed ( atom - molecule ) state and a pure molecular state as in the former bistability , but also transitions between two distinct mixed states . </S>"
