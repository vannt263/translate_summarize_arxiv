    "the cosmological background determines the growth rate of matter density fluctuations . this is the result of two effects .",
    "first , the initial conditions are specified in terms of the density contrast field @xmath14",
    ". therefore the actual density , @xmath15 , which dictates the dynamical evolution , as can be seen for example from the spherical top - hat model , depends on the mean matter density , @xmath16 .",
    "the second effect comes about simply because the mean matter density varies with time according to the assumed cosmological model .",
    "this in turn translates into a dependence of the evolution of the fluctuation field @xmath10 on the parameters of the cosmological model : the density parameter , @xmath0 , and the cosmological constant , @xmath1 .",
    "here we focus on the following aspect of the dependence of dynamics on the cosmological background . starting from an initial density fluctuation field and a given amplitude of the evolved field",
    ", we address the question : how do the evolved peculiar velocity and density fields depend on the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ? in the linear ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) and in the zeldovich quasilinear ( zeldovich 1970 ) approximations , once an initial density fluctuation field is evolved to a given amplitude , it does not contain any information on the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in these approximations ,",
    "the peculiar velocity field is simply proportional to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the so - called linear growth factor .",
    "this result is easy to understand . in the linear approximation ,",
    "the density fluctuations are merely amplified by a time dependent factor , @xmath3 . in the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "the displacement vector is the product of the initial gravity field and the function @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , second order perturbation theory calculations ( e.g. bouchet 1992 ) have shown that moments of the density fluctuation field are very insensitive to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in the highly nonlinear regime , n - body simulations ( e.g. davis 1985 ) show that the final matter distribution in simulations with the same initial conditions changes very little as the parameters of the cosmological background are varied .",
    "significant differences between flat and open models are found only in the cores of what are identified as rich clusters in these simulations .",
    "these results have proved useful in analyzing observations of the large scale structure .",
    "nusser and dekel ( 1993 ) , for example , used n - body simulations to argue that a recovery of the initial density fluctuations from the observed galaxy distribution is almost independent of @xmath17 , where as a recovery from the observed peculiar velocity field is sensitive to the assumed @xmath0 .",
    "they applied their reconstruction method to the potent compilation of the peculiar velocity data and to the 1.2 jy iras survey and concluded that @xmath19 with high confidence .",
    "bernardeau ( 1995 ) used second order perturbation theory to argue that the reduced skewness of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field is inversely proportional to @xmath18 , in accordance with the scaling implied by the zeldovich approximation .",
    "they found that the measured skewness is consistent with @xmath0 of about unity .",
    "here we aim at a better understanding of the dependence of the equations of motion on the cosmological parameters . in section 2",
    "we write the equations of motion in a form which is almost independent of the background cosmology .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0 dependence in toy - models in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we use high resolution n - body simulations to investigate in detail the differences in the matter distribution in flat and open models .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in section 5 .",
    "we restrict our treatment to the case of a matter dominated universe with a cosmological constant , i.e , we assume that the total mean density is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the matter contribution and @xmath22 is the cosmological constant .",
    "we use the standard notation in which , @xmath23 is the scale factor , @xmath24 is the time dependent hubble factor , @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the critical density .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be the position and peculiar velocity of a particle in comoving coordinates .",
    "the equations of motion are : the continuity equation @xmath30 the euler equation of motion , @xmath31 and the poisson equation , @xmath32 note that we have defined @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the peculiar gravity potential in comoving coordinates .",
    "equations ( [ cont ] ) , ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) together with the friedman equations for the background quantities @xmath0 and @xmath35 fully specify the dynamics of pressure free density fluctuations . the scale factor , @xmath35 , can be solved for using the friedman equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and 0 correspond , respectively , to closed , open or flat universes .",
    "energy conservation , @xmath39 , yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 and the subscript 0 denotes quantities at the present time .",
    "therefore , energy conservation and ( [ scale ] ) yield @xmath42    the hubble factor , @xmath43 , can be eliminated from these equations by working with a new time variable @xmath44 .",
    "we define a new `` velocity '' @xmath45 . in these new variables ,",
    "the poisson equation remains unaltered while the continuity and euler equations become @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the time dependent deceleration parameter and we have used @xmath49 to derive ( [ euleralpha ] ) .    attempting to eliminate @xmath0 from ( [ euleralpha ] )",
    "we further make an additional transformation from the time variable @xmath50 to @xmath5 defined by @xmath51 where @xmath3 is the linear growing density mode determined by the equation , @xmath52 analytic solutions to ( [ growth ] ) can be found in heath ( 1977 ) . expressing ( [ euleralpha ] ) in terms of @xmath5 defining the `` velocity '' @xmath53 , continuity equation is @xmath54 and the euler equation is @xmath55\\vtheta = -{3\\over 2}\\omega \\vnabla \\phi   , \\label{eulertheta}\\ ] ] where , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the linear growth factor which relates density contrast , @xmath10 , to the divergence of the peculiar velocity field , @xmath58 , in the linear regime . for @xmath59 , a good approximation ,",
    "the function @xmath18 satisfies @xmath60 which to first order in @xmath61 yields @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( see also lightman & schechter 1990 ) . however , the general solution to this equation is better fitted by @xmath64 for @xmath65 . a fit which works well for @xmath66",
    "is @xmath67 for @xmath18 is @xmath64 ( peebles 1980 ) . for @xmath68 , lahav ( 1991 )",
    "found that @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , for reasonable values of the cosmological constant we neglect the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath70 in the approximate forms for @xmath18 ( lahav 1991 ) .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath71 . in the zeldovich approximation",
    ", this is the displacement vector of a particle from its initial to present position . using ( [ growth ] ) , we find @xmath72 so the euler equation ( [ eulertheta ] ) is @xmath73\\left(\\vg -\\vtheta\\right)=0 , \\label{eulernom}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and we have defined @xmath75 . the weak dependence on @xmath0 in ( [ eulernom ] ) through @xmath76 couples to the difference between the velocity , @xmath77 , and the gravity field , @xmath78 . since @xmath79 at early times , initially the function @xmath80 almost vanishes , thus , any changes in the dynamics as a result of this weak dependence on @xmath0 occur at later times .    in virialised regions , the acceleration of a particle",
    "is dominated by the gravity field @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to see that by neglecting the terms involving the velocity in ( [ eulernom ] ) and working with a new time variable with respect to which the velocity is @xmath81 we obtain an euler equation which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this velocity is approximately equal to the comoving peculiar velocity divided by @xmath82 .",
    "this scaling with @xmath0 is not surprising since the virial theorem implies that the @xmath8 value of the physical velocities in virialised regions with a given density contrast has similar scaling with @xmath0 .",
    "note however that the scaling is only approximate since the density profile of virialised objects has some dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear from the form of ( [ eulernom ] ) that the source term which drives the evolution is larger for lower @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we expect to see more evolved clustering in a low @xmath0 universe than in an @xmath83 universe with the same initial conditions and linear normalisation .",
    "it is instructive to investigate the effect of the term @xmath80 in cases of special symmetry .",
    "consider first the spherical expansion or collapse before the occurrence of shell crossing .",
    "this case illustrates the effect of of changing @xmath0 in the before shell - crossing . in cases of special symmetry ,",
    "we find it easier to solve directly for @xmath10 and @xmath84 rather than for @xmath85 and @xmath77 .",
    "therefore we take the divergence of ( [ eulernom ] ) and use the poisson equation to obtain @xmath86\\left(\\delta -\\theta \\right)=0 , \\label{raych}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 at the centers of configurations with planar , cylindrical and spherical symmetry , respectively . therefore , in the spherical top - hat model , the equations ( [ raych ] ) , ( [ contnom ] ) together with the equations relating @xmath35 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath18 are sufficient to determine the evolution of the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath10 . for @xmath7 , the spherical collapse model can be solved analytically ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) if the initial peculiar velocity is neglected . here",
    "we numerically integrate the equations ( 14 ) and ( 17 ) under the initial conditions , @xmath90 with @xmath91 , where the subscript @xmath92 refers to quantities at the initial time .",
    "these initial conditions are realistic as they arise naturally in linear theory ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) .    in figures 1 and 2",
    "we show the density contrast versus the time @xmath5 for positive ( @xmath93 ) and negative ( @xmath94 ) tophat perturbations for three background cosmologies : ( @xmath95)=(@xmath96 ) , ( @xmath97 ) and ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows curves for two values of the initial density contrast corresponding to bound and unbound perturbations for the @xmath99 cosmologies .",
    "although the equations were integrated from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , for the sake of clarity , figure 1 shows results only for @xmath102 . for bound perturbations ,",
    "the growth of @xmath10 and @xmath84 is fastest in the open universe case , ( @xmath99 , @xmath103 ) .",
    "however , significant deviations appear only when @xmath10 is larger than @xmath104 or so .",
    "this is consistent with the work of peacock and dodds ( 1996 ) who found that nonlinear effects in the evolution of power spectra in n - body simulations are stronger in an open universe than in a flat @xmath105 universe of the same @xmath0 .",
    "although the @xmath106 case shows more rapid evolution than the @xmath83 case , the corresponding curves are very similar even when the densities are larger than their values at turnaround .",
    "the reason for this is clear from figure 3 which shows @xmath0 versus @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath107 we see that @xmath0 is almost unity until relatively late times .",
    "therefore , until late times , the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath84 is very similar to the @xmath108 case . for positive unbound and negative perturbations ,",
    "the effect of the cosmology on the evolution of @xmath10 is almost negligible .",
    "the @xmath84 curves show some differences . in voids ,",
    "@xmath84 grows more slowly in the low @xmath109 models once the density contrast approaches @xmath38 . since perturbations in flat universes with a cosmological constant evolve similarly to those with @xmath59",
    ", we do not discuss the case @xmath110 further .",
    "the top - hat model can be used to evaluate how the variance of an evolved generic density fluctuation field depends on @xmath0 .",
    "we require here that the density field is smoothed on large enough scales such that shell - crossing is removed .",
    "curves of @xmath111 versus @xmath112 satisfy the following ( empirical ) relation @xmath113   , \\label{domega}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 this relation works remarkably well for @xmath115 and @xmath116 . for generic configurations we assume that the relation ( [ fit ] ) is still valid .",
    "however we should take into account the fact that the `` dimensionality '' of the collapse affects the amplitude of the @xmath0 dependence ; for example in the one dimensional collapse , before shell crossing , the equations are free of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we replace @xmath117 , in ( [ fit ] ) , with @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the `` dimensionality '' of the collapse at each point in space .",
    "other than for purely symmetric configurations , the quantity @xmath120 is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "one possibility is to define it at any point in space in terms of the eigenvalues of the initial velocity deformation tensor , say , as the ratio of the square of the sum of the eigenvalues to the sum of their squares .",
    "nevertheless , for our purposes it is not crucial to specify the form of @xmath120 and we simply treat it as a factor which depends on the local topology of the density field . if @xmath121 is the probability distribution function of the field @xmath122 evolved with @xmath83 , then it can be shown that the variance , @xmath123 , of the field @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 ^ 2 { \\rm d}\\delta_1 -1 , \\label{prob}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the ratio @xmath126 to account for the change in the volume element as a result of the change in density . by expanding ( [ domega ] )",
    "to third order in @xmath122 and substituting the result in ( [ prob ] ) we find @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the variance of the field @xmath122 and @xmath129 where @xmath130 is some number describing the dimensionality of typical collapse configuration .",
    "note that , in deriving the last relation , we have neglected any local correlation between @xmath120 and @xmath122 .",
    "the factor @xmath131 should depend on the power spectrum of the initial fluctuations and it can be determined empirically from n - body simulations .",
    "consider now the effect of changing @xmath109 on the dynamics in shell - crossing regions in the case of 1-dimensional collapse .",
    "this case is particularly instructive since solutions ( @xmath132 ) to the 1-dimensional equations of motion are fully independent of @xmath0 until the occurrence of shell - crossing .",
    "unfortunately , even in the simple one dimensional collapse , we have no analytic solutions in shell - crossing regions .",
    "therefore we first use the zeldovich solution until the formation of the first singularity",
    ". then we switch on to a one - dimensional n - body code to move particles according to ( [ eulernom ] ) in the shell - crossing phase .",
    "the initial density field we choose is @xmath133 .",
    "results of simulations with @xmath108 and @xmath99 without a cosmological constant are shown in figure 4 . the density profile ( upper panel )",
    "is more concentrated in the open than in the flat case .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of density perturbations in the tophat model discussed above .",
    "the distribution and velocities of particles in the open model seem to be more evolved in time than in the flat model .",
    "we use n - body simulations to study the @xmath0 dependence under general initial conditions .",
    "these simulations are especially useful in orbit mixing regions where , according to ( [ eulernom ] ) , the effect is most important .",
    "we ran two simulations having @xmath108 and @xmath134 respectively .",
    "both simulations were started from the same initial conditions .",
    "the initial conditions were generated from the power spectrum for standard cdm with @xmath135 .",
    "each simulation contained @xmath136 particles in a cubic box of length @xmath137 .",
    "the simulations were evolved until the linear @xmath8 density fluctuations in a sphere of @xmath138 was 0.5 .",
    "both models have roughly the right small scale power as measured by the galaxy pairwise velocity , but produce fewer rich clusters than observed .",
    "however , given the scale of our simulations , our choice of the power spectrum and the normalisation is appropriate for our purposes .",
    "a model with a higher normalisation would result in too much merging of smaller objects into a few larger objects . choosing a steeper power spectrum leads to a similar effect .",
    "the simulations were run using a modified parallel version ( macfarland 1997 ) of couchman s p@xmath139 m code ( couchman 1995 ) which uses explicit message passing .",
    "the simulations had a softening parameter of @xmath140 the mean particle separation and a mesh size of 512 in one dimension .",
    "they were run using 64 processors on the cray t3e supercomputer at the computer center of the max planck society ( rzg ) , garching .",
    "figure 5 shows the particle distribution in a slice of thickness @xmath141 , in the two simulations .",
    "the left and right panels correspond to the flat and open model respectiveley .",
    "the lower panels zoom in on the `` clusters '' seen near the centers of the upper panels . on large scales ( upper panels )",
    "the two simulations are remarkably similar .",
    "some differences can be spotted in the lower panels .",
    "clusters in the low @xmath0 simulation appear to be more concentrated and evolved .",
    "the differences between the the two simulations seem to be negligible on scales larger than @xmath142 . indeed the @xmath8 value of the difference between the positions of the same particles in the two simulations is @xmath143 and the largest difference is less than @xmath144 .",
    "the correlation functions for the two simulations , plotted in figure 6 , confirm the visual impression from figure 5 .",
    "the correlation functions differ only on scales smaller than @xmath145 . on `` cluster ''",
    "scales @xmath146 the low @xmath0 correlation function is larger and , on scales @xmath147 roughly corresponding to the scale of infall regions around clusters in the simulations , it is smaller than the correlation function in the flat model .",
    "we now quantify the differences between the density and velocity fields .",
    "we first use the cloud - in - cell ( cic ) interpolation scheme to evaluate the density and velocity fields on a cubic grid of cell length equal to the mean particle separation .",
    "this produces a mass weighted average velocity on the grid points .",
    "we then further smooth the resultant density and velocity maps with a top - hat filter . in figure 7",
    "we plot the densities in the open vs those in the flat model for 4096 randomly chosen grid points .",
    "even with only cic smoothing on the grid scale , the correlation between the two density fields is very tight . for densities larger than @xmath104 or so the densities in the open model are larger .",
    "the scatter almost vanishes when the density fields are smoothed with a top - hat window of width @xmath148 .",
    "note however that for moderate densities ( @xmath149 ) , the densities in the flat model are slightly larger than the open model .",
    "this is not surprising since the general tendency is that matter flows out of regions with moderate densities into higher density regions . and",
    "since the open model is slightly more evolved , these moderate density regions are somewhat less dense in the open than in the flat model . in table 1",
    "we list the values of the @xmath8 , @xmath150 , and the reduced skewness , @xmath151 of the density fields as a function of the smoothing scale .",
    ".moments of the density field in the two simulations after cic and top - hat smoothing of width,@xmath152 , expressed in km / s .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it appears , from the table , that the dependence of @xmath153 on @xmath0 is stronger than what is predicted from second order perturbation theory ( bouchet 1992 ) . that theory is , however , valid only for @xmath154 .",
    "we can use table 1 to determine @xmath155 in ( [ sigom ] ) which relates @xmath156 in an open universe to that in an @xmath83 universe .",
    "a comparison of ( [ sigom ] ) with table 1 suggests that @xmath157 .",
    "this value is reasonable since non - linear collapse configurations are likely to have pancake - like shapes .",
    "recall that the simulations were stopped when the the linear value of of @xmath156 smoothed with a top - hat filter of width @xmath158 was 0.5 .",
    "the actual value computed from the simulation is very close to @xmath159 in the two simulations .",
    "thus , even though nonlinear effects are clearly important , the difference between the @xmath160 in the open and flat simulations is negligible .",
    "we now consider the evolved velocity fields .",
    "figure 8 compares one of the components of the velocity fields in the two simulations .",
    "the velocity fields in the open model are scaled by the factor @xmath161 . even for large velocities and small smoothing widths ,",
    "the velocity fields in the two simulations seem to be related by the factor @xmath18 .",
    "a close inspection of the scatter plot for @xmath162 reveals that the slope of the regression of @xmath163 on @xmath164 is slightly less than unity .",
    "this is because large velocities are generally associated with strong nonlinear effects which tend to spoil the scaling by @xmath18 .",
    "we mentioned at the end of section 2 , that the motion of particles in bound objects is independent of @xmath0 in terms of a time variable which corresponds to a velocity which is the peculiar comoving velocity divided by @xmath12 .",
    "therefore we expect the velocity dispersion ( @xmath8 velocity ) in groups of particles identified in the simulation to scale , approximately , like @xmath12 . to test this conjecture , we have used a friends - of - friends ( f.o.f ) algorithm ( kindly supplied by a. diaferio ) to identify groups in the simulations .",
    "we then computed the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of particles in each group .",
    "figure 9 ( upper panel ) shows the mean velocity dispersion in groups as a function of the number of particles they contain .",
    "velocities in the plot are scaled by @xmath165 for the open model .",
    "it seems that this scaling works well .",
    "given the uncertainties in identifying group members by the f.o.f algorithm , the deviations from this scaling for large groups are not significant .",
    "we conclude that while the ( smoothed ) average velocity of particles scales like @xmath166 , the @xmath8 velocity , roughly , scales like @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the abundance of groups in the two simulations .",
    "the lower panel of figure 9 is a plot of the abundance as a function of the number of particles for the two simulations .",
    "the abundance of groups is slightly higher in the open model .",
    "this is easy to understand , because groups in the open model are tighter than groups in the flat model , the f.o.f algorithm naturally assigns more particles to them .",
    "note that observations naturally provide the abundance of groups as a function of the mass .",
    "since the mass of groups with the same number of particles is proportional to @xmath109 , abundance curves , when plotted versus the mass , look significantly different in the two simulations .",
    "we have shown that gravitational dynamics of a pressureless fluid in an expanding universe is almost independent of the cosmological parameters . according to the equations of motion , expressed in terms of the linear growing mode ,",
    "the final structure in a low @xmath0 model , with or without a cosmological constant , is more evolved than in a flat universe .",
    "we used toy - models and n - body simulations to investigate the effect of changing the cosmological background on the evolution of fluctuations and , in particular , on the final velocity and density fields .",
    "the present density , when smoothed on scales slightly larger than cluster scale , is almost insensitive to the cosmological background .",
    "the background can affect the structure of bound objects ( or halos ) .",
    "halos , characterised by the same ratio of mass to background density , are more centrally concentrated in an open than in a flat universe . however , this effect is weak and is likely to depend on the initial power spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of the comoving peculiar velocities of particles strongly depends on @xmath0 .",
    "it is remarkable that the smoothed nonlinear velocity field scales with the growth factor , @xmath18 , just as it does in linear theory .",
    "since @xmath18 depends very weakly on the cosmological constant , the final velocity field is mainly sensitive to @xmath0",
    ". therefore the observed peculiar velocity and density fields in the nearby universe contain information only on @xmath0 ( lahav 1991 ) .",
    "however , constraints on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 can , in principle , be obtained by measuring the clustering amplitude at different redshifts , for example via the correlation function ( lahav 1991 ) .",
    "as we have shown , it is rather difficult to detect signatures of the cosmological background in the structure of density fields .",
    "fortunately , observations provide the distribution of galaxies in redshift space .",
    "thanks to the strong dependence of the velocity field on @xmath0 , the anisotropy of clustering in redshift space can provide a measure of @xmath0 .",
    "however , such estimates of @xmath0 involve an assumption on the relationship between the distribution of galaxies to that of the dark matter .",
    "estimates of @xmath0 independently of the galaxy distribution can be obtained from the observed peculiar velocity field alone ( c.f .",
    "dekel 1994 ) .",
    "this makes peculiar velocity catalogs a very powerful too to constrain the cosmological model .",
    "it is especially important for future peculiar velocity measurements to aim at larger sky - coverage and denser sampling rate .",
    "we especially would like to thank ravi sheth for many useful comments , and tom macfarland for his valuable contributions to running and improving the parallel p3mn - body code .",
    "we also thank simon white for useful discussions , and antonaldo diaferio for allowing the use of his group finding code ."
