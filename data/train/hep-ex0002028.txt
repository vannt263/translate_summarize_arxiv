    "the study of a new phenomenon in science often ends up in a null result",
    ". however it might be of great importance to set upper limits , as this will help our understanding by eliminating some of the theories proposed .",
    "the determination of upper limits is presently a hotly debated issue in several fields of physics .",
    "many papers have been devoted to this problem and different solutions have been proposed . in particular the problem has been discussed in paper @xcite ( `` unified approach '' ) and , more recently , in papers @xcite , based on the bayes theory .",
    "the use of the `` unified approach '' ( fc ) to set upper limits or confidence intervals is recommended by the pdg @xcite .",
    "the `` unified '' and the bayesian approaches are very different , not only in the sense that they lead to different numerical results but more radically in the meaning they attribute to the quantities involved .",
    "these differences lead to intrinsic problems in any comparison of their separate results .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to try to throw some light on this contentious and important issue .",
    "we shall show that the bayesian approach is the correct one .",
    "if our argument is accepted by the scientific community , many debates about upper limits will be clarified .",
    "according to the ( fc ) `` unified approach '' the upper limit is calculated using a revised version of the classical neyman construction for confidence intervals .",
    "this approach is usually referred to as the `` unified approach to the classical statistical analysis '' , and it aims to unify the treatment of upper limits and confidence intervals . on the bayes side , according to @xcite , the upper limit may be calculated using a function @xmath0 that is proportional to the likelihood .",
    "this function is called the  relative belief updating ratio  and has already been used to analyse data in papers @xcite .",
    "the procedure has been extensively described by g. d agostini in @xcite .",
    "comparison between the two approaches is difficult for the general case .",
    "but we have noticed a special case which is easier to discuss . in this case",
    "the greater efficacy of one approach compared to the other one seems clear .",
    "this case is when the experiment gave no events , even in the presence of a background greater than zero .    when there are zero counts , the predictions obtained with the two methods are different and both are -intuitively- quite disturbing",
    ". our intuition would , in fact , be satisfied by an upper limit that increases with the background level , and this is , in general , the case when the observation gives a number of events of the order of the background .",
    "however , when zero events are observed , the `` unified approach '' upper limit decreases if the background increases ( a noisier experiment puts a better upper limit than a less noisy one , which seems absurd ) while the bayesian approach leads to the predictions that a constant upper limit will be found ( the upper limit does not depend on the noise of the experiment ) .",
    "various papers@xcite have been devoted to the problem of solving some intrinsic difficulties with the  unified  approach : in particular to solving the problem of  enhancing the physical significance of frequentist confidence intervals@xcite , or to imposing",
    " stronger classical confidence limits@xcite . in this latter article the proposed method",
    " gives limits that do not depend on background in the case of no observed events  ( that is the bayesian result ! ) .",
    "in what follows we will give an explanation for the two results .",
    "we remind the reader that the physical quantity for which a limit must be found is the events rate ( i.e. a gravitational wave burst rate ) @xmath1 . here",
    "we will assume stationary working conditions .",
    "for a given hypothesis @xmath1 , the number of events which can be observed in the observation time @xmath2 is described by a poisson process which has an intensity equal to the sum of that due to background and that due to signal .    in general , the main ingredients in our problem are that :    * we are practically sure about the expected rate of background events @xmath3 but not about the number of events that will actually be observed ( which will depend on the poissonian statistics ) .",
    "@xmath2 is the observation time ; * we have observed a number @xmath4 of events but , obviously , we do not know how many of these events have to be attributed to background and how many ( if any ) to true signals .    under the stated assumptions , the likelihood is @xmath5    we will now concentrate on the solution given by the bayesian approach .",
    "the `` relative belief updating ratio '' @xmath0 is defined as :    @xmath6    this function is proportional to the likelihood and it allows us to infer the probability that @xmath7 signals will be observed for given priors ( using the bayes s theorem ) .    under the hypothesis @xmath8 if @xmath9 , @xmath0 becomes    @xmath10    the upper limit , or -more properly-  standard sensitivity bound \" @xcite , can then be calculated using the @xmath0 function : it is the value @xmath11 obtained when    @xmath12    we remark that 5% does not represent a probability , but is a useful way to put a limit independently of the priors .",
    "[ eq : erre ] when no events are observed , that is , when @xmath4=0 , becomes : @xmath13    thus putting @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ cinque ] we find @xmath15 , independently of the value of the background @xmath16 .",
    "we will not describe the well known ( fc ) procedure here , but we would just observe that , according to this procedure , for @xmath14 and @xmath17 , the upper limit is 3.09 ( numerically almost identical to the bayes one ) @xmath18 it decreases as @xmath16 increases ( e.g. for @xmath14 and @xmath19 the upper ( fc ) limit at 95% cl is 1.47 ) .    in an attempt to understand such different behaviour we will now discuss some particular cases .",
    "suppose we have @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "this certainly means that the number of accidentals , whose average value can be determined with any desired accuracy , has undergone a fluctuation .",
    "the larger the @xmath16 values , the smaller is the @xmath21 probability that such fluctuations will occur .",
    "thus one could reason that it is less likely that a number @xmath22 of real signals could have been associated with a large value of @xmath16 , since the observation gave @xmath14 .    according to the bayesian approach ,",
    "instead , one can not ignore the fact that the observation @xmath14 has already being made at the time the estimation of the upper limit comes to be calculated .",
    "the bayesian approach requires that , given @xmath14 and @xmath20 , one evaluates the @xmath23 that a number @xmath22 of signals exists .",
    "this @xmath23 of a possible signal is applied to the observation that has already been made .",
    "suppose that we have estimated the average background with a high degree of accuracy , for example @xmath16=10 . in the absence of signals , the a priori probability of observing zero events , due just to a background fluctuation ,",
    "is given by @xmath24    now , suppose that we have measured zero events , that is @xmath4=0 .",
    "in general @xmath25 .",
    "it is now nonsense to ask what the probability that @xmath4=0 is , since the experiment has already been made and the probability is 1 .",
    "we may ask how the a priori probability would be changed if @xmath22 signals were added to the background .",
    "we get @xmath26    it is obvious that @xmath27 can only decrease relative to @xmath28 , since we are considering models in which signal events can only add to noise events[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "the right answer is guaranteed if the question is well posed .",
    "given all the previous comments , the most obvious question at this point is : * what is that signal @xmath22 which would have reduced the probability @xmath29 by a constant factor , for example 0.05 ? *    @xmath30    using eqs .",
    "[ solonoise ] , [ signalnoise ] and [ finale ] the solution is : @xmath31 that is : @xmath32    now suppose another situation , @xmath16=20 , thus @xmath33 . repeating the previous reasoning we still get the limit 2.99 .",
    "the meaning of the bayesian result is now clear : we do not care about the absolute value of the a priori probability of getting @xmath14 in the presence of noise alone .",
    "the observation of @xmath14 means that the background gave zero counts by chance .",
    "even if the a priori probability is very small , its value has no meaning once it has happened .",
    "the fact that the single background measurement turned out to be zero , either due to a zero average background or due to the observation of a low ( a priori ) probability event , must not change our prediction concerning possible signals .    for @xmath14",
    "we are certain that the number of events due to the background is zero .",
    "clearly this particular situation gives more information about the possible signals . in the case",
    "@xmath34 , instead , it is not possible to distinguish between background and signal .",
    "the mathematical aspect of this is that the poisson formula when @xmath14 reduces to the exponential term only , and thus it is possible to separate the two contributions , of the signal ( unknown ) and of the noise ( known ) .",
    "we note that the different behaviour of the limit in the unified approach is due to the non - bayesian character of the reasoning .",
    "in such an approach an event that has already occurred is considered `` improbable '' : given the observation of @xmath14 they still consider that the probability @xmath35 decreases as @xmath16 increases .",
    "as a consequence they deduce that to a larger @xmath16 corresponds a smaller upper limit @xmath22 .",
    "given the previous considerations , we must now admit that our intuition to expect an upper limit that increases with increasing background , even when @xmath14 , was wrong .",
    "we should have expected to predict a constant signal rate , as a consequence of the observation of zero events , independently of the background level .",
    "we have compared the upper limits obtained with the ( fc ) `` unified '' and with the bayesian procedures , in the case of zero observed events .",
    "we believe that the greater efficacy of the bayesian approach compared to the ( fc ) method , demonstrated for the case @xmath14 , is a strong indication that the bayesian method -natural , simple and intuitive- is the correct one .",
    "thus we agree with the proposal in@xcite that this method should be adopted by the scientific community for upper limit calculations ( see , for example , @xcite on upper limits in gravitational wave experiments ) .",
