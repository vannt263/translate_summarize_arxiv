    "fig : u-4](a ) and ( b ) shown here in the supplementary material , we see that the momentum distribution @xmath36 of the majority component shrinks during the expansion , whereas the distribution @xmath37 of the minority component broadens significantly . this is the result of collisions between up and down fermions which take place in the inner part of the system , where both spin components are present , and transfer momenta between them . in the long time limit and for @xmath95 , the pairs phase separate from unbound fermions , such that the cloud develops a two - shell structure with a fully paired core and fully polarized wings containing the excess @xmath96 fermions .",

    "the main reason for the separation of excess fermions from pairs is , as discussed in the main text , the difference in the bare velocities of pairs and excess fermions . in the lattice",
    "this difference is large at @xmath109 yet the quantum distillation mechanism still works even at intermediate values of @xmath110 as shown here .",

    "for the parameters of fig .",

    "fig : mdf_trap ] ) . during the expansion",
    ", one can see that the behavior of the mdfs is very similar to the one starting from a box in fig .  1 of the main text .",
    "all mdfs become stationary shortly after the release from the trap .",
    "the stationary @xmath36 is narrower while @xmath37 is broader than their corresponding initial distributions , and the double peak structure in @xmath38 , which is due to the fflo correlations in the initial state , disappears .",
    "we have also studied the time - evolution of other 1d models during the expansion , including most notably the repulsive hubbard model with @xmath119 ( compare @xcite ) .     for the expansion from a box trap with @xmath120 , @xmath26 , @xmath119 , plotted at times @xmath121 .",
    "we observe that in the case of repulsive interactions , much shorter times can be reached than for @xmath122 . on the accessible time scales ,",
    "the mdf still changes , yet at its edge , the curves for @xmath60 and @xmath123 lie on top of each other . ]",
    "the @xmath70 case turns out to be a numerically much harder problem for @xmath0-dmrg , as entanglement grows much faster ( see the review @xcite for how entanglement growth limits @xmath0-dmrg ) .",
    "therefore , we resorted to exploiting non - abelian symmetries as well , restricting the analysis to @xmath119 , allowing us to reach @xmath124 for @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u8 ] ) . in the case of @xmath120 , there are no pairs , and hence over the full extent of the expanding cloud , majority and minority fermions can still interact , whereas in the case of @xmath122 and @xmath125 , fast majority fermions escape @xcite and the pairs and majority fermions mostly decouple due to the quantum distillation mechanism that is described in the main text .",
    "this is likely the reason why in the repulsive gas with @xmath70 and @xmath119 , there is a stronger entanglement during the expansion . on the accessible time scales , the mdf @xmath14 of the repulsive gas still undergoes changes , yet",
    "in the edge of the mdf , the curves at the longest times coincide ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the case of @xmath70 thus sets an example where the quantum simulation with ultra - cold atomic gases could help us to go to longer times than what is currently possible with numerical methods to clarify the asymptotic behavior of the mdf ( compare the relaxation dynamics problem studied in ref .",
    "note that for the expansion of a repulsive gas with initial densities @xmath126 , the double - occupancy _ decreases _ @xcite , in contrast to the attractive case , discussed in the main text . in the attractive case , the survival of a certain fraction of the initial double occupancy is expected due to the presence of pairs ."

    "<S> our results show that , in a lattice system , the nodal structure of the fflo state is ultimately lost as the system expands . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the main focus was on rather small polarizations @xmath34 @xcite leading to a wide partially polarized core before the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect the quantum distillation mechanism to take much longer to depolarize the core than what has so far been reached in numerical simulations @xcite , leaving this case as an open question .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now in a position to explain the anticorrelated behavior of @xmath36 and @xmath37 mentioned in the discussion of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath73 is essentially equal to @xmath74 and is approximately unchanged during the expansion , rendering the interaction energy almost time independent . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that also the kinetic energy @xmath75 is approximately conserved , which is only possible if the two mdfs behave in the opposite way during the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening of the minority mdf @xmath37 with respect to the initial state is a direct consequence of the spatial separation of excess fermions from the pairs , leaving the latter confined in the center of the cloud . since in the center the local polarization decreases </S>",
    "<S> , the stationary form of @xmath37 is well approximated by the equilibrium one for equal populations @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the mdfs become stationary after the expansion from a box or a harmonic trap is in itself not surprising , as in the limit of long expansion times , the cloud becomes very dilute with , for the attractive case , the typical inter - particle distance being much larger than the bound - state size . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one may assume that pairs and unpaired particles are essentially noninteracting . </S>",
    "<S> the mdf in such an asymptotic limit should be determined by the initial conditions right after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for generic models , the total energy ( which is conserved during the expansion ) plays a fundamental role in determining the expansion dynamics ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a related work for @xmath70 ) . for an integrable model , such as the ( attractive ) hubbard model of eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> all integrals of motion are in principle known from the bethe ansatz and are conserved during the expansion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we argue below how to interpret the shape of certain stationary mdfs in terms of such integrals of motion . </S>",
    "<S> this is closely related to the previously studied fermionization of the mdf of an expanding gas of hard - core bosons @xcite .    for the model studied here </S>",
    "<S> , we first note that the formation of a distinct minimum in the difference distribution @xmath78 [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp_mdf](a ) and ( b ) ] is reminiscent of the corresponding distribution of real - valued charge rapidities ( for intermediate @xmath29 ) in the ground state in a box . from the point of view of the rapidity distributions , </S>",
    "<S> they need to be determined right after turning off the trap and the subsequent expansion does not play any role ; it is the mdfs which will evolve and asymptotically approach the former as the expansion proceeds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can calculate the pre - quench values of the rapidities by numerically solving the bethe - ansatz equations for a system of size @xmath2 and open boundary conditions @xcite . for the ground state of the attractive hubbard model , there are two types of rapidities present : real- and complex - valued charge rapidities ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) which correspond to unpaired fermions and pairs , respectively ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , with @xmath80 and @xmath83 appearing pairwise ) .    to calculate the effect of the quench of the trapping potential exactly is in principle possible but complicated in practice @xcite , so we will resort to some simplifications . </S>",
    "<S> to start , we assume that the number of pairs is conserved during the quench , and thus no pure - spin excitations are produced . </S>",
    "<S> further , we use the observation that the overlap between the pre - quench eigenstate and the post - quench state has a maximum amplitude for components of the latter with the same set of rapidities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then identify , asymptotically , the distribution of real - valued charge rapidities with that of unpaired fermions ( @xmath84 ) , and of the real part of complex - valued ( string ) charge rapidities with that of minority fermions ( @xmath37 ) since they remain paired . finally , we model the quench by convolving the pre - quench distributions @xmath85 and @xmath86 with the ( periodized ) kernels : ( i ) @xmath87 for the former and ( ii ) a simple lorentzian for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the first choice is inspired by the exact result for the release of a single particle from a box , while the second choice is done for simplicity given that the results are relatively featureless in comparison . </S>",
    "<S> illustrative results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp_mdf ] and the agreement is very good , specially away from the brillouin - zone center . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are no fitting parameters in the case of @xmath84 and a single fitting parameter , the width of the lorentzian , in the case of @xmath37 .     </S>",
    "<S> [ ( a),(b ) ] and @xmath37 [ ( c),(d ) ] for the expansion from a box with @xmath26 , @xmath35 ( corresponding to @xmath43 , @xmath64 ) [ ( a),(c ) : @xmath88 , ( b),(d ) : @xmath42 ] to the form expected from the rapidities known from the bethe - ansatz : @xmath0-dmrg ( solid lines ) , models discussed in the text ( dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical lines mark the positions of the rapidities.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in conclusion , we demonstrated that the initial fflo state is destroyed during the expansion of an attractively interacting partially polarized 1d fermi gas , and that direct signatures of the fflo phase in the initial pair mdf are washed out as a consequence of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the sudden expansion is an interesting non - equilibrium experiment that through the asymptotic form of the mdfs yields information on the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that the shape of the mdfs can be related to the distribution of rapidities , which constitute a full set of integrals of motion for this integrable quantum model and fully determine the initial state . since we showed that the mdfs of majority and minority fermions as well as the one of pairs rapidly take a stationary form , this should be accessible on typical experimental time - scales .    we thank x. guan and r. hulet for their comments on the manuscript . </S>",
