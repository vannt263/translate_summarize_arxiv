    "our observable 1 + 3-dimensional universe could be a surface , the brane , embedded in a dimensionally richer 1 + 3+@xmath4-dimensional spacetime ( @xmath4 being the number of extra dimension ) , the bulk",
    ". this intriguing idea can be motivated by string theory , where at least 6 extra spatial dimensions are required , in particular , by stringy inspired models designed to address the disparity between the electroweak ( @xmath5 tev ) and the gravity ( @xmath6 tev ) scales .",
    "there are two basic scenarios commonly evoked to generate the hierarchy between these two fundamental scales of nature : either by suggesting the source of the hierarchy to be the volume of a flat extra dimensional space  @xcite or the strong curvature of that space  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in constraining the large extra dimension ( led ) scenario  @xcite in connection with neutrino physics since right handed neutrinos ( standard model ( sm ) singlet fields ) in this case can , as well as gravity , propagate in the bulk .",
    "tabletop experiments devised to test for deviations of newtonian gravity can only probe led up to submillimeter sizes . the most stringent upper limit given by a torsion pendulum instrument",
    "is 200 @xmath1 m at 95% c.  l.   for the size of the largest flat extra dimension regardless of the number of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "neutrino physics can be considerably more sensitive to led .",
    "we should , however , mention that astrophysical bounds on led are in general much more stringent ( see e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) than the ones obtained by the terrestrial experiments including that from collides . however , these astrophysical bounds are not completely model independent and therefore , we believe that studying the possible impact of led which can be probed ( independently from astrophysical constraints ) by terrestrial experiments is still worthwhile .",
    "there are mounting evidences from several solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite and terrestrial  @xcite neutrino experiments that neutrinos undergo flavor oscillations due to mass and mixing .",
    "as it was shown in  @xcite , led can have strong impact on neutrino oscillation probabilities .",
    "however , since the current neutrino data mentioned above are perfectly consistent with the standard three flavor oscillation scheme , the effect of led , if it exists , is expected to be present only as a subdominant effect on top of the usual oscillation . therefore , as was done in  @xcite , in this work we assume that led effect would only perturb somewhat the standard oscillation pattern and try to constrain led using the current oscillation data .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the possible impact of led on the former and current oscillation experiments chooz  @xcite , kamland  @xcite and minos  @xcite in order to obtain the upper bound on the size of the largest extra dimension , which turns out to be submicrometer range .",
    "we do not consider solar and atmospheric neutrino data in this work because the analysis would become much more complicated due to the matter effect and also because we expect similar bounds from these data ( see sec .",

    "we will assume that one of these extra dimensions is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath11 , much larger than the size of the others so that we can in practice use a 5-dimensional treatment .    by this assumption ,",
    "our bounds are always more conservative than the ones obtained by assuming all the led radius @xmath11 are the same for @xmath12 . in other words , if we have adopted the same assumption ( of equal raduis for all led ) , we should have obtained stronger bounds on @xmath11 for @xmath12 because the conversion into kk modes would be more efficient under such an assumption for @xmath12 .",

    "[ sec : current ] and [ sec : future ] we discuss here what is to be expected of the effects of led on the survival probabilities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] we show the survival probabilities for @xmath53 and @xmath41 as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath29 in vacuum for nh and ih for minos ( @xmath54 km ) , kamland ( @xmath43 km ) and chooz ( @xmath44 km ) , assuming @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath1 m . there are three basic effects of led : a displacement of the minima with respect to the standard survival probabilities , a global reduction of the flavor survival probabilities as sm neutrinos can oscillate into kk modes and the appearance of extra wiggles on the probability pattern due to the fast oscillations to these new massive modes .    when matter effects can be ignored , the impact of led in the survival amplitude , to leading order in @xmath57 , is such that @xmath58 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : vac ] ) . therefore , roughly speaking , in order to modify the standard probability by say @xmath59 10% by the effect due to led , at least one of the @xmath60 should be order of @xmath59 0.1 . since we know , from atmospheric neutrino oscillation , that at least one neutrino has a mass @xmath61 ev , we can estimate that @xmath62 implies @xmath63 @xmath1 m . so one can expect the terrestrial experiments to be sensitive around this scale , which is consistent with our results discussed in the next section .    from now on we will drop the @xmath64 superscript when referring to flavor oscillations . in the case of @xmath65 , from fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] we see that the effect of led is basically the same for nh and ih .",
    "this is because @xmath66 is of the same order for nh ( mainly driven by @xmath67 ) and ih ( mainly driven by @xmath68 ) . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath69 the effect of led",
    "is significantly larger for ih than nh since @xmath70 is suppressed due to small @xmath71 for nh ( since @xmath72 for vanishing @xmath38 ) whereas for ih the dominant led contributions ( due to @xmath73 and @xmath68 ) are not suppressed .    in this paper",
    "we do not consider the appearance channels such as @xmath74 and @xmath75 due to the following reasons .",
    "first of all , when @xmath76 is zero or much smaller than the current bound , we found that the impact of led for these appearance channels is very small compared with that of the disappearance modes considered in this work . in principle , even if @xmath76 is zero , led can induce a flavor transition such as @xmath74 ( for t2k and no@xmath3a ) through the right handed kk modes but such a transition is a kind of second order effect ( this is because , ignoring oscillation driven by solar parameters , @xmath53 would not be converted directly to @xmath77 but only through kk modes ) whereas the impact of led for the disappearance channel is the first order effect , or it is the consequence of the direct transition from active to sterile kk modes .",
    "this argument applies also to the appearance experiments like lsnd  @xcite , karmen  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite , and therefore we do not consider these experiments in this work , as they do not make any significant contribution to improve the bounds we obtained .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath76 is large enough to be observed by t2k and no@xmath3a ( in the absence of led ) , then the impact of led can be sizable but only as a small perturbation on top of the standard oscillation unless we consider led parameters not allowed by the disappearance modes .",
    "while led can be potentially harmful in the appearance modes for the determination of the mass hierarchy and/or cp phase delta , we believe that the appearance mode is not important ( due to much smaller statistics than the disappearance ones ) in constraining led .",
    "here we discuss the limits on the size of led one can obtain from the former and current neutrino oscillation experiments chooz , kamland and minos .",
    "we could have considered other terrestrial experiments in our analysis , but we have restricted ourselves to these three . regarding the long baseline experiments , kamland and minos are currently the best ones in terms of statistic and systematics .",
    "while the inclusion of other short baseline experiments could , in principle , improve our results , we have verified that this improvement is not very significant , since a large fraction of the uncertainties of these experiments are correlated .",
    "we do not consider solar and atmospheric neutrino data for simplicity , and also because we do not expect significant improvement in constraining led by adding these data ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "the chooz experiment is a former long ( for reactor ) baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment .",
