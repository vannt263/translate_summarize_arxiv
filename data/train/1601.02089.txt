    "the concept of non - hermitian systems with @xmath0-symmetry has developed into a rapidly evolving research field in contemporary physics , extending from quantum mechanics  @xcite and field theory  @xcite to systems with topological states  @xcite , optics  @xcite and acoustics  @xcite . in the seminal work of bender _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that a class of non - hermitian hamiltonians can possess , for certain parametric ranges , entirely real eigenvalue spectra , indicating the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric phase where the hamiltonian @xmath1 and the @xmath0 operator share the same set of eigenvectors . on the other hand , by varying the parameter which determines the amount of loss and gain , a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs such that @xmath1 and @xmath0 , though still commuting , possess different eigenvectors with complex energy eigenvalues .",
    "the progress in the field of @xmath0-symmetric systems has since been enormous , to a wide extent impelled by the adaptation of the corresponding concepts in optical structures and the experimental realization of spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the link between classical optics and quantum mechanics here stems from the effective description of light propagation in waveguide systems by the schrdinger equation , with time represented by the waveguide axis within the paraxial approximation @xcite . in the realm of discrete optics , one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0-symmetric photonic waveguide systems",
    "have been associated with remarkable phenomena such as double refraction  @xcite , power oscillations  @xcite and non - reciprocal diffraction  @xcite . in the presence of nonlinearity , unidirectional  @xcite and asymmetric  @xcite wave propagation have been observed .",
    "such intriguing properties are present in a large class of oligomers  @xcite , i.e. single @xmath0 dimers  @xcite , trimers  @xcite and quadrimers  @xcite . moreover , in extended @xmath0-symmetric lattices the occurrence of bloch oscillations @xcite and universality in beam dynamics  @xcite have been reported .",
    "the addition of a second loss / gain rate has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite where the focus was on nonlinear modes in finite @xmath0-symmetric systems and in  @xcite where a closed - form quadrimer was addressed .",
    "an open perspective is the effect of competing pairs of loss / gain elements on the band structure of lattice systems and on the induced beam dynamics .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric wave mechanics has also been applied to light scattering , owing to the isomorphy between the helmholtz and stationary schrdinger equations . with refraction index landscapes which obeying @xmath2 , which corresponds to balanced gain and loss  @xcite ,",
    "such @xmath0-symmetric setups have been shown to feature scattering properties such as simultaneous coherent absorption and lasing  @xcite and anisotropic transmission resonances  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bound or periodic @xmath0-symmetric systems , here the energy ( frequency ) of the incoming wave is real by definition , and the unbroken phase is indicated by the field itself being in a @xmath0 eigenstate . considering the plethora of different types of @xmath0-symmetric settings in general wave mechanics , continuous or discrete systems with closed , periodic , or scattering boundary conditions , the need for a simple yet universal quantity that pinpoints the broken and unbroken @xmath0 phases in all cases  thus going beyond",
    "the hamiltonian spectrum  becomes clear .    in the present work",
    "we show that the spatial average of a discrete , @xmath0-adapted nonlocal current can take on this role in general 1d lattice systems . together with its continuous counterpart proposed recently for scattering systems  @xcite",
    ", this quantity provides a natural order parameter for @xmath0-symmetric 1d systems , derived directly from their eigenstates , which universally describes the transition between broken and unbroken phases .",
    "we here demonstrate its applicability for a periodic @xmath0-symmetric waveguide array with multiple , qualitatively different regimes of nonhermitian evolution owing to the interplay of two competing pairs of loss / gain elements within a quadrimer constituting the unit cell . using a bloch mode analysis we associate the light propagation properties in extended waveguide arrays to the enriched band structure landscape which allows for the control of the propagation distance of gaussian wave packets prior to their divergence in the @xmath0 broken phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we introduce the setup and the nonlocal currents which are used to obtain the corresponding phase diagram of the isolated quadrimer cell . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] we investigate the lattice band structure for varying cell parameters and show that the symmetry breaking information can be extracted from the nonlocal currents of bloch states .",
    "we then demonstrate how the loss / gain pair competition may be used to control the dynamics of designed wave packets in the broken phase . in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] we conclude our results .",
    "( color online ) schematic of the setup , consisting of four waveguides with equal refraction indices @xmath3 , uniform hoppings @xmath4 and two competing loss / gain parameters @xmath5 . ]",
    "we start by analyzing a @xmath0-symmetric finite array of @xmath6 photonic waveguides ( quadrimer ) as shown in fig.[fig : sketch ] , which will later constitute the unit cell of a periodic array .",
    "the quadrimer has on - site elements @xmath7 with common refraction index @xmath8 and _ two different _ loss / gain rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath0-symmetric arrangement : @xmath11 . in the paraxial approximation @xcite ,",
    "the propagation of the light field along the @xmath12-axis is described by a set of four ( @xmath13 ) equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 couples light from waveguide @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "considering common internal couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the state vector @xmath20 of the isolated quadrimer is then governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath21 with hamiltonian matrix @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 is a ( right ) eigenvector of @xmath1 with eigenvalue @xmath26 , @xmath27 , then the close - coupling equations ( [ light_propag_1 ] ) become @xmath28 throughout the paper , we measure lengths , field amplitudes and @xmath29-elements in units of @xmath30 ( lattice constant ) , @xmath31 ( amplitude unit ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath29-element unit ) , respectively , which are in turn set to unity , @xmath33 .",
    "the aim is now to extract the information on whether this state is @xmath0 broken or unbroken from mode amplitudes @xmath34 alone , in terms of a single quantity .",
    "to do so , we combine eq.([static_helm1 ] ) with its complex conjugate at the @xmath0-related site @xmath35 to construct the difference @xmath36 where the @xmath0 symmetry @xmath37 has been taken into account , with the _ nonlocal current _ of mode @xmath38 defined here as @xmath39 if the eigenvalue @xmath26 is complex , then @xmath40 varies along the array , but for @xmath41 we have from eq.([q_with_e ] ) that @xmath42 , and so the nonlocal current is _ spatially constant _ for real @xmath26 , and further vanishes , @xmath43 , since @xmath44 is then a @xmath0 eigenstate .",
    "hence , we can use the site - averaged current @xmath45 as a single quantity which distinguishes the unbroken phase with @xmath46 from the broken one with @xmath47 .",
    "this extends the use of a symmetry - adapted nonlocal current as an order parameter for phase transitions in @xmath0-symmetric systems from scattering in continuous setups @xcite to eigenmodes in discrete setups ( note that no site average is needed for scattering where @xmath48 is a real input parameter ) . a generic account on nonlocal currents in discrete models with symmetry domains will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we employ them to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking in globally @xmath0-symmetric finite and periodic arrays .",

    "variation of @xmath10 in the presence of the additional loss / gain rate @xmath9 allows for a variety of transitions between broken / unbroken or between different broken @xmath0 phases at multiple transition points , generally not symmetric around @xmath65 .",
    "for example , region @xmath66 is characterized by two real @xmath67 and a complex conjugate pair , indicating wave propagation which is qualitatively different from region @xmath68 with two conjugate eigenvalue pairs .",
    "the qualitatively different propagation properties in regions @xmath69 and @xmath68 are discussed in app.[sec : app_single_excitation ] , with the behavior around the transition at the exceptional point @xmath70 highlighted in app.[sec : app_ep ] .",
    "regions @xmath71 and @xmath72 both have two distinct conjugate pairs of imaginary eigenvalues , though arising from different types of transitions from @xmath68 and @xmath66 , with a double splitting of degenerate imaginary pairs ( at @xmath73 ) as opposed to a splitting and two branch continuations ( at @xmath74 ) .    as is seen , all four @xmath75 vanish in the @xmath0-unbroken phase with @xmath76 = 0 $ ] ( regions @xmath77 ) , while following the profile of the @xmath76 \\neq 0 $ ] in the @xmath0-broken phases .",
    "the nonlocal current is thus a quantity that exposes the nonhermitian part of the discrete spectrum although being constructed solely from the spatially resolved wavefunction with no direct reference to the onsite potential or the mode eigenvalues .",
    "it equally characterizes , however , @xmath0 phase transitions for scattering states with real energy , as shown in ref.@xcite , thus unifying the description of @xmath0-symmetric bound and unbound systems ( instead of employing either the hamiltonian or @xmath78-matrix eigenvalues , respectively ) .",
    "let us now elaborate further on the information contained in the quantities @xmath75 .",
    "specifically , they can be used to express symmetry _",
    "remnants _ in the nondegenerate phases of broken @xmath0 symmetry , where the individual @xmath75 are nonzero . due to the commutation @xmath79 = 0 $ ] , in the @xmath0-broken phases with complex @xmath26 ( such as regions @xmath80 of fig.[figq ] ) we have that eigenstate pairs @xmath81 with complex conjugate eigenenergies @xmath82 are related by @xmath83 .",
    "this remnant of @xmath0 symmetry in the broken phase is encoded in the nonlocal currents : whereas both @xmath84 of a @xmath0-related pair are nonzero and vary spatially , their sum always vanishes , @xmath85 which is due to the @xmath0-antisymmetry of @xmath86 itself .",
    "at the level of the average nonlocal currents we have @xmath87 as a single parameter describing the symmetry remnant in each subspace of @xmath0-related mode pairs .",
    "equivalently , we can express the symmetry remnant of the system by the vanishing sum @xmath88 over all modes , signalizing the invariance of the complete eigenspace of the hamiltonian under @xmath0 operation ( up to a phase for @xmath0-unbroken modes ) .",
    "this further demonstrates the capability of the @xmath75 to capture features related to the @xmath0 symmetry breaking and indicates that they can serve as a generic tool for a systematic approach to symmetry breaking in 1d systems .    at this point ,",
    "let us comment on some similarities which can be identified between the transition from the @xmath0 unbroken to the @xmath0 broken phase and the thermodynamic phase transitions in the mean field approach ( e.g. landau theory  @xcite ) where critical fluctuations are absent : ( i ) in both cases there exists a quantity which is zero ( nonzero ) in the phase of the unbroken ( broken ) symmetry , this being the order parameter @xmath89 in thermodynamics ( e.g. the mean magnetization for the ising case ) , while in @xmath0 symmetry breaking this role is assigned to @xmath90 .",
    "( ii ) in the vicinity of the transition from unbroken to broken phases both @xmath89 and @xmath90 follow a power law with exponent @xmath91 ( in the present case the explicit form is @xmath92 ) .",
    "the same occurs in a multitude of @xmath0 transition scenarios for , e.g. , single dimers or quadrimers with @xmath93 or with @xmath94 .",
    "such common transition features arise for spontaneous symmetry breaking upon varying a suitable parameter ( loss / gain rates in @xmath0-symmetric systems and temperature in thermodynamics ) , as a result of the absence of interactions and criticality in the mean field approximation .    before proceeding to the extended lattice in the next section ,",
    "we briefly address the relation of the so called quasipower @xmath95 to the nonlocal currents @xcite , here based on eq.([q_with_e ] ) .",
    "the quasipower has been shown  @xcite to be conserved along @xmath12 in @xmath0-symmetric systems for any propagating excitation and any choice of loss / gain parameter values , in contrast to the usual power @xmath96 which generally oscillates in the @xmath0 symmetric phase or grows in the @xmath0 broken phase  @xcite . to study the behavior of the quasipower of a single mode @xmath97 ,",
    "its nonlocal current @xmath98 can be employed : summing eq.([q_with_e ] ) over @xmath17 yields @xmath99 \\,p_{q}^{(j)},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 ( with @xmath6 for the quadrimer ) .",
    "now , since @xmath101 due to the boundary conditions , it follows that @xmath102 , showing that the quasipower vanishes for any eigenmode in the @xmath0 broken phases of a finite array .",
    "we now turn to the periodic lattice with the quadrimer above as the unit cell .",
    "the aim is to investigate how the competing loss / gain pairs affect the band structure and accordingly the beam dynamics in large waveguide arrays , as well as the existence of nonlocal currents which describe the occurrence of @xmath0 eigenstates .",
    "the index @xmath17 now enumerates the repeated quadrimers coupled by intercell hopping @xmath103 , and wave fields @xmath104 are assigned ( from the left ) to the waveguides of the @xmath17-th quadrimer .",

    "the four eigenvalues @xmath111 ( @xmath125 ) of @xmath126 constitute the band structure of the system , whose real and imaginary parts are shown for varying @xmath10 fig.[fig : bands ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , with the competing loss / gain parameter @xmath9 kept fixed .",
    "as we see , the bands have imaginary branches for any @xmath127 , indicating the general absence of a @xmath0-symmetric phase ( that is , im@xmath128=0 $ ] @xmath129 ) for the chosen parameters ( this is a general feature for @xmath130 ) .",
    "in particular , the interplay of @xmath5 causes the coexistence of real and complex energy regions . the latter appear around the center and edges of the bz with their size tuned by @xmath10 , which in turn determines the width of the @xmath131-regions with im@xmath128=0 $ ] .",

    "let us first , however , investigate whether the nonlocal currents for the periodic system @xmath134 do capture the @xmath0-symmetry breaking characteristics as they did for the isolated quadrimer above . taking the @xmath135 expressions of eq.([q1 ] ) and employing the bloch theorem ,",

    "this confirms the applicability of the nonlocal currents also in periodic lattice systems as state - derived indicators of @xmath0-broken / unbroken parts in the bz .",
    "the key advantage of the coexistence competing loss / gain parameters pairs , as indicated above , is the flexibility to engineer the band with desired regions of complex energies around the center and edges of the bz .",
    "this suggests the possibility to design setups where suitably prepared beams will propagate substantial distances ( in fact , beyond the experimentally realized waveguide length ) without divergence even in the @xmath0 broken phase . to elaborate on this concept via an exemplary case we focus on the band structure for @xmath119 , shown in fig.[fig : bands ] ( e ) , with complex band branches around the center ( @xmath138 ) and edges ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the distance @xmath140 where divergence of a launched wave packet sets in ( which we define by the doubling of optical power , @xmath141 ) depends on how well it is localized around its initial momentum @xmath142 and in turn whether @xmath142 lies on ( or close to ) band branches with im@xmath143 < 0 $ ] causing exponential increase ( recall that a mode @xmath97 evolves in @xmath12 as @xmath144 ) .",

    "the array is chosen large enough to enable a connection between the basic wave packet propagation properties and the features of the given band structure .",
    "for a small momentum @xmath123 , the distance @xmath140 decreases with increasing @xmath121 ( fig.[fig : bands](f ) ) .",
    "in contrast , for a moderate momentum @xmath124 the trend of @xmath140 is reversed , with the propagation distance now increasing with @xmath121 ( fig.[fig : bands](g ) ) . as we see , the wave packet can indeed travel a long distance @xmath120 without diverging ( as in fig.[fig : bands](f ) for small @xmath121 ) , even though an unbroken @xmath0-symmetric phase ( defined by @xmath146=0~\\forall j , k$ ] ) is overall absent in the band structure . in other words , propagation properties which would be expected only in the @xmath0-symmetric phase of a setup may also be encountered as transient phenomena in the much larger parameter regions of @xmath0 broken phases . in the following ,",

    "if the wave packet is spatially broad and strongly localized in @xmath131-space , the dispersion ( fig.[fig : bands ] ( e ) ) suggests that it will diverge after a relatively long ( short ) propagation distance @xmath120 when it is initially localized in a @xmath131-region without ( with ) im@xmath128<0 $ ] . to illustrate this mechanism in the beam dynamics ,",

    "<S> it is shown that the transitions between the phases are described by a symmetry - adapted nonlocal current which maps the spectral properties to the spatially resolved field , for the lattice as well as for the isolated quadrimer . </S>",
    "<S> its site - average acts like a natural order parameter for the general class of one - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians , vanishing in the unbroken phase and being nonzero in the broken phase . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the beam dynamics in the array is affected by the presence of competing loss / gain rates in the unit cell , showing that the enriched band structure yields the possibility to control the propagation length before divergence when the system resides in the broken @xmath0 phase . </S>"
