    "recently , the @xmath5 transition - metal iridium oxides have attracted significant attention , because they exhibit a number of exotic phenomena induced by the spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) and the correlation effects of electrons  @xcite . of these iridates ,",
    "sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 of particular interest for it shares many analogies with the parent compound la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 of high-@xmath6 cuprate superconductors , such as the same layered perovskite crystal structure @xcite , the same antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating ground state  @xcite , the similar magnetic excitation spectrum  @xcite and electronic structure  @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed theoretically to realize the unconventional superconductivity via doping  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the recent angle - resolved - photoemission - spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements on the slightly electron - doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 show a temperature - dependent pseudogap phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the spectra is much suppressed in an extended region near @xmath7 , resulting in the fermi arc which resembles the case in the hole - doped cuprates  @xcite . for the slightly hole - doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1",
    ", another arpes experiment also exhibits the trait of pseudogap  @xcite , but with the suppression of spectral near the @xmath8 point . as the pseudogap puzzle is the longstanding unsolved problem in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "studying the origin of the fermi arcs and pseudogaps in doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 is not only important for this material itself , but might also help to investigate the similar phenomena in high-@xmath6 cuprates and/or other materials .",
    "sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 shows a multi - orbital electronic structure where the @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals are separeted by large crystal field .",
    "the five electrons ( one hole ) reside in the lower @xmath9 manifold of @xmath11 orbitals . in spite of the large band width and small coulomb interactions , sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 is an antiferromagnetic insulator  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the soc breaks this sixfold degenerate manifold into completely filled @xmath12 bands and a half - filled @xmath4 band ( kramers doublet ) which is further split by the relatively small coulomb interactions .",
    "thus , it can be simplified to an effective one - band half - filled system , which hosts an isospin @xmath4 spin - orbital mott insulating ground state  @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of this isospin @xmath4 mott picture including its robustness to dopings still remains an open question  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these experimental and theoretical progress , we carry out a theoretical study of the collective excitations and quasiparticle spectra in the doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , based on the three - orbital hubbard model with the inclusion of the soc .    the multi - orbital structure together with the soc confines the exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods to very small systems .",
    "in view of this , the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation is a good alternative  @xcite .",
    "the flex method has advantages to handle various collective fluctuations , and the calculation results agree well with the qmc simulations for the hubbard model with the moderate on - site interaction @xmath13  @xcite . up to now",
    ", the flex approach has been extensively applied to the high-@xmath6 cuprates  @xcite , the iron - based superconductors  @xcite , and other correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the previous flex calculations are restricted to the case with the spin rotational invariance . in order to include the soc",
    ", we will use the technique of hugenholtz diagrams to extend the flex approach to more general cases , where the su(2 ) symmetry can be broken .",
    "based on this method , we find that the spectral function of quasiparticles is much suppressed at parts of momenta in the lightly doped region , suggesting the emergence of the pseudogap .",
    "explicitly , the suppression occurs near @xmath7 point for slightly electron doping and thus leads to the fermi arc near @xmath8 , while their positions are reversed in the hole - doped side .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent arpes observations  @xcite .",
    "we elaborate that the fermi arcs and pseudogaps are mainly caused by the isospin fluctuation with momentum ( @xmath14 ) , which overwhelms both the spin and orbital fluctuations .",
    "we have also studied the evolution of various collective fluctuations with doping and find that the isospin fluctuation dominates in the region from 30% hole - doping to 50% electron - doping .",
    "these results suggest that the scenario of @xmath4 spin - orbital mott insulator is applicable to the parent and the extensively doped compounds of sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",

    "note that we have fabricated @xmath43 to be a compact form to conveniently construct the hugenholtz vertices .",
    "in this section , we give a thorough introduction of the generalized flex method , which can naturally include the soc term .",
    "the flex approach originates from the conserving approximation theory proposed by baym and kadanoff  @xcite . in this formulism ,",
    "the closed - linked @xmath44 diagrams ( also known as luttinger - ward functional  @xcite ) yield the self - energy and the irreducible interaction vertices in a thermodynamic self - consistent manner , in which the conservation laws on the particle number , momentum , angular momentum and energy are respected .",
    "the flex method pioneered by bickers and scalapino  @xcite is the simplest application of the baym - kadanoff formulism beyond the hartree - fock level , and has been widely applied to the single- and multi - orbital hubbard models  @xcite , in which the spin rotational invariance is respected . when the su(2 ) spin symmetry is conserved , the scattering processes explicitly include the equal - spin particle - particle ( pp ) , opposite - spin pp , equal - spin particle - hole ( ph ) , and opposite - spin ph channels ( see ref .",
    "if the su(2 ) symmetry is broken , however , one must consider the pp and ph fluctuations in a comprehensive manner for there are mixtures of equal - spin and opposite - spin scatterings .",
    "we employ the hugenholtz diagrams  @xcite to extend this method to the su(2 ) broken cases . considering the on - site two - body potential @xmath45 where the index @xmath46 denote both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "we have completed the introduction of the formal flex formulations , in practical application some reasonable approximations are widely used to simplify the computations .",
    "first , when the on - site interactions are all repulsive , the contributions of the pp rpa - bubbles in fig . [ phi ] ( e ) are relatively small and therefore could be safely left out  @xcite .",

    "@xcite to efficiently include the contribution of high matsubara frequencies .",
    "the analytical continuation of green s functions to the real frequency is carried out by pad@xmath89 approximation  @xcite .",
    "the convergent solutions of the flex equations are obtained if the relative error of each matrix element of @xmath90 is smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "let us first define corresponding susceptibilities for various collective excitations relevant to the following discussions .",
    "the static transverse spin ( ts ) and longitudinal spin ( ls ) susceptibilities are given by @xmath92 where the spin and orbital degrees of freedom have been expressed by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the charge fluctuation is too small compared to other fluctuations and thus is not discussed here . because of the introduction of soc , the contribution of orbital fluctuations is no longer neglectable , so we define the static transverse orbital ( to ) and longitudinal orbital ( lo ) susceptibilities @xmath95",
    "as discussed in the introduction , it has been suggested that the low - energy physics in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 may be described as an effective one - band model with the isospin @xmath4@xcite . to check its possible application here ,",

    "then , the static transverse isospin ( ti ) and longitudinal isospin ( li ) susceptibilities are given by , @xmath99     electron - doping and @xmath100 .",
    "( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show static ts , ls , to and lo susceptibilities , respectively .",
    "( e ) and ( f ) show static ti and li susceptibilities ( see text ) . the ts fluctuation in ( a ) no longer exhibits the @xmath101 symmetry with the introduction of soc .",

    "[ sus1 ] ( a)-(d ) .",
    "as expected , the strong peaks exist around ( @xmath103 ) , which are reminiscences of the afm order in the parent compound .",
    "in particular , the intensities of orbital susceptibilities are all stronger than those of spin susceptibilities , and the to fluctuation overwhelms the lo fluctuation .",
    "these features are consistent with the experimental results in the single - crystal neutron diffraction  @xcite and nonresonant magnetic x - ray diffraction  @xcite .    fig",
    ".  [ sus1 ] ( e ) and ( f ) show the ti and li susceptibilities for the same @xmath102 electron doping at @xmath100 .",
    "the peaks also reside at the same momenta as in the spin and orbital fluctuations .",
    "quite strikingly , the intensity of the ti susceptibility is almost one order of magnitude larger than that of all other fluctuations . to show in more detail the effects of the isospin fluctuations , in fig .",
    "[ sus0 ] ( a ) we compare the maximum magnitude of @xmath104 at @xmath105 , from 40% hole - doping to 30% electron - doping , with @xmath20 denoting ti , li , to , lo , ts and ls channels .",
    "the afm order is determined by the numerical criterion in the ph channel , as introduced in sec.ii b. as shown , the ti susceptibility tends to diverge as the system approaches the afm state , from both the electron - doped side and the hole - doped side .",
    "these results suggest that the afm order in the undoped and slightly doped system is mainly caused by the ti fluctuation .",
    "consequently , it shows that the effective one - band model with the isospin @xmath4",
    "@xcite can describe the magnetic properties reasonably in the undoped and slightly doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "another feature drawn from fig .  [ sus0 ] ( a ) is that the afm is more robust against the hole - doping in comparison to the electron - doping , which may be useful for the related experimental investigations .     as a function of electron doping ( positive ) and hole doping ( negative ) at @xmath105 , with @xmath106ti , li , to , lo , ts or ls .",

    "[ sus0 ] ( a ) shows that the ti fluctuation decreases rapidly with doping .",
    "however , it still has larger magnitude than all others in the region of 30% hole - doping to 50% electron - doping ( the results for @xmath112 electron - doping are not shown here ) , though their differences are decreased with dopings . in this region ,",
    "the momentum @xmath113 is at or near the @xmath114 point .",
    "when doping the system further with holes ( @xmath112 ) , the spin fluctuation becomes dominant so that the effective one - band picture is broken down .",
    "these results can be understood from the weights of the @xmath4 doublet and @xmath12 quartet along the fermi surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sus0 ] ( b ) .",
    "one can see that the closed electron pocket centered around the @xmath115 point is composed mainly of the @xmath4 doublet , while the hole pocket around @xmath114 mainly of the @xmath12 quartet . for @xmath107 hole - doping",
    ", the hole fermi pocket becomes large and introduces a fermi surface nesting between the hole and electron pockets , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sus0 ] ( b ) .",
    "thus , the inter - pocket particle - hole scattering between the @xmath4 dominant band and @xmath12 dominant band takes action and overwhelms the intra - pocket scattering in the @xmath4 dominant band , which makes the isospin fluctuation no longer the leading collective excitation . on the other hand , from the distribution of orbital characters shown in fig .",
    "[ sus0 ] ( c ) , we can find that the main inter - pocket scattering occurs in the same orbital , which makes the orbital fluctuations also suppressed .",
    "therefore , the spin fluctuation is the dominant collective excitation for the heavily hole - doped system .",
    "however , the fermi level moves away from the @xmath12 dominant band with the electron doping , consequently it is only the @xmath4 dominant band that crosses the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the one - band picture is always robust against the electron doping .",
    "furthermore , we have also examined the range of validity of the effective one - band picture with respect to the strength of soc . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sus0 ] ( d ) , the ti susceptibility prevails all others for 20% hole - doping if @xmath116 , indicating that this picture survives in an extended range .       for 10% electron - doping ( a ) and 5% electron - doping ( b ) at @xmath117 .",
    "spectral functions @xmath118 at @xmath105 ( c ) and @xmath100 ( d ) for 3% electron - doping .",
    "the pink ( black ) , green ( red ) , gray ( blue ) lines in ( e ) are @xmath119 dependence of the spectral functions for @xmath105 ( @xmath100 ) , at three momenta indicated by the arrow in ( c ) and ( d ) . an enlarged version for @xmath100 is shown in ( f ) . the white lines in ( c ) and ( d ) denote the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone . ]    [ gk_nt ]    the pseudogap behavior can be detected from the single particle spectral function which is defined as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 denotes both spin and orbital indices . in fig .

    ", we show the contour plot of the zero - energy spectrum at @xmath117 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 electron - doping , respectively .",
    "since the system has been away from the afm order at these dopings [ see fig .",
    "[ sus0 ] ( a ) ] , an intact fermi surface is expected in the conventional normal state .",
    "indeed , for @xmath122 electron - doping , a closed diamond - shaped fermi surface is observed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gk_nt ] ( a ) .",
    "however , an obvious reduction in the spectral intensity occurs around @xmath7 and its symmetric points for @xmath123 electron - doping .",
    "this reduction is strongly temperature - dependent , because it appears only below a certain temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gk_nt ] ( c ) and ( d ) at @xmath102 electron - doping for @xmath105 and @xmath100 , respectively . owing to the suppression of the spectra near @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the fermi surface around these momenta is destructed and the four residual separated segments form the so - called fermi arcs [ see fig .",

    ", we show the energy distribution curves ( edc ) of the spectral functions for @xmath102 electron - doping at three momentum points near @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ gk_nt ] ( e ) .",
    "one can see that the suppression occurs basically around the fermi energy when the temperature is decreased from @xmath105 to @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , different from a well defined quasiparticle peak at @xmath105 , the spectral functions at @xmath100 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 show a weak dip around the fermi energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gk_nt ] ( f ) .",
    "it suggests that a weak pseudogap does exist around @xmath2 and its symmetric momenta for slightly electron - doping .",
    "since thers is no long - range order in this doping range , the pseudogap is most likely to result from the scattering of quasiparticles by the collective excitations . in this framework ,",
    "the quasiparticles around @xmath2 and @xmath7 are strongly coupled by the collective excitations with the transferred momentum @xmath114 in the scattering process . in accord with this analysis , the results presented in fig .",
    "[ sus1 ] demonstrate that all collective excitations , including the spin , orbital and isospin fluctuations , exhibit the characteristic momentum @xmath114 .",
    "in particular , the transverse isospin ( ti ) fluctuation overwhelms the spin and orbital fluctuations .",

    "especially , for @xmath129 the elements included in the ti susceptibility are calculated to amount to 91.3% weight of the total ph susceptibilities for 3% electron - doping at @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , it suggests that the scatterings of quasiprticles by the ( @xmath14 ) ti fluctuation lead to a weak pesudogap partially opened around @xmath130 and @xmath131 .     at @xmath132 and @xmath100 for 17% hole - doping .",

    "[ fa_hole ] . at @xmath132 , there is a nearly circular fermi surface around the @xmath133 point . by decreasing the temperature to @xmath100 , the spectral weights are suppressed on some fermi momenta and consequently it leads to the formation of the fermi arcs .",
    "however , the suppressions now appear around @xmath8 , which is contrary to the case of the electron - doping shown in fig .",
    "[ gk_nt ] ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "this suppression also results from the ( @xmath14 ) ti fluctuation . in this case",
    ", the fermi surface shrinks in comparison with that of electron - doping , so that the  hot spots \" ( the crossing points of the fermi surface with the boundary of the afm brillouin zone ) at which the quasiprticles are strongly scattered move from the @xmath131 and @xmath130 points to the @xmath134 points ( see fig .

    "we investigate various collective fluctuations and the spectral function of quasiparticles .",
    "it is found that the isospin fluctuations derived from the @xmath4 spin - orbit mott insulator dominate over the spin , orbital and charge fluctuations in the extended doping region , suggesting the validity of the isospin @xmath4 picture in an extended doping regime .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experimental measurements , we study the quasiparticle spectra and the collective excitations in doped sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , in which the interesting interplay between the electronic correlations and strong spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) exists . to include the soc </S>",
    "<S> , we use the hugenholtz diagrams to extend the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approach to the case where the su(2 ) symmetry can be broken . by using this generalized flex method </S>",
    "<S> , we find a weak pseudogap behavior near @xmath2 in the slightly electron - doped system , with the corresponding fermi arc formed by the partial destruction of fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> similar features also appear in the hole - doped system , however , the position of the fermi arc is rotated @xmath3 with respect to the former . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the recent angle - resolved photoemission spectra in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate that these anomalous phenomena are caused by the scatterings of quasiparticles off the isospin fluctuation derived from the effective @xmath4 doublet . </S>"
