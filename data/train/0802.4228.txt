    "the recent compilation of oscillation data from the atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite , and long baseline @xcite neutrino experiments has provided solid evidence that neutrinos have small but non - zero masses . a global fit",
    "to current data gives the following @xmath7 limits for the mixing parameters  @xcite , @xmath8    since then , the measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters have entered a precision era . on the other hand ,",
    "as no information exists for the value of @xmath5 , the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrinos , the dirac and/or majorana cp phases , and the neutrino mass hierarchy , there are discoveries that are still yet to come .    in the standard model ( sm ) , due to the lack of right - handed neutrinos and the conservation of lepton numbers , neutrinos are massless . to generate non - zero neutrino masses thus calls for physics beyond the sm .",
    "there have been many theoretical ideas proposed with an attempt to accommodate the experimentally observed small neutrino masses and the larger mixing angles among them . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have surveyed 63 models in the literature that are still viable candidates and have reasonably well - defined predictions for @xmath5 . we found that the predictions for @xmath9 of half of the models cover the range from 0.015 to the present upper bound of 0.13 . consequently , half of the models can be eliminated in the next generation of reactor experiments .",
    "one of the implications of the observation of neutrino oscillation is the possibility of measurable branching ratio for charged lepton flavor - violating ( lfv ) decays . while not the case in the sm , predictions of the supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theories ( gut ) for these rare decays are much enhanced , as these processes are suppressed by the susy scale , rather than the plank scale @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as different models obtain large neutrino mixing angles through different mechanisms , their predictions for the lfv charged lepton decays can be very distinct .",
    "consequently , lfv charged lepton decays may provide a way to distinguish different susy gut models .    among the models aiming to explain the neutrino masses and mixing , a particularly promising class are those based on ( susy ) so(10 )",
    "; for recent reviews of so(10 ) models , see @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the predictions for various lfv charged lepton decays as well as muon - electron conversion in five of the susy so(10 ) models , assuming constrained minimal susy standard model ( cmssm ) boundary conditions where only five soft - susy breaking parameters are present .",
    "furthermore , we impose the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) dark matter constraints in the neutralino , stau and stop coannihilation regions . specifically , we present the allowed values for these soft - susy parameters for various branching ratios of these rare lfv processes . in addition , the lower bounds on the predictions for these rare processes in the five different susy so(10 ) models are given .",
    "we find that the predictions in these models are very distinct .",
    "we note the crucial role of the wmap constraints in deducing the lower bounds on the predictions .",
    "many authors have previously studied the branching ratio predictions for charged lfv decays in the susy gut framework .",
    "rather than study specific models , they generally adopt a generic approach and assume a nearly diagonal cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm)-like or bimaximal pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns)-like mixing matrix to diagonalize the yukawa neutrino matrix @xcite . following the procedure of casas and ibarra @xcite to invert the seesaw formula ,",
    "they have carried out monte carlo studies by scanning the unknown right - handed neutrino mass spectrum and the angles and phases of the inversion matrix in order to present scatter plots of the rare branching ratios . a few exceptions to this procedure can be found in ref .",
    "here we are interested in specific models in order to determine the ability of the lfv experiments to differentiate among and rule out some models .",
    "the models chosen are highly predictive and illustrate a wide variety of textures for the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , and predictions for the right - handed neutrino mass spectrum and the reactor neutrino mixing angle , @xmath5 .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe the five representative susy so(10 ) models that we have analyzed . in sec .",
    "iii we review lfv charged lepton decays in the sm and susy guts and present the predictions for the five susy so(10 ) models considered . in sec .",
    "iv their expectations for @xmath2 conversion are given .",
    "v concludes this paper .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of the general formalism on which the supersymmetric @xmath3 grand unified models are based .",
    "for all five models to be illustrated , the seesaw mechanism @xcite is of the conventional type i leading to normal hierarchies for the light majorana neutrinos .",
    "the leptonic sector of the yukawa superpotential at the gut scale can then be written as @xmath10    where @xmath11 represents the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath12 the left - handed conjugate neutrino singlet , and @xmath13 the left - handed conjugate charged lepton of one of the three @xmath14 dimensional representations of @xmath3 . when the two higgs doublets , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , acquire vacuum expectation values , the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices are generated and can be written in @xmath17 form + @xmath18    { \\cal m}^\\nu & = & \\left(\\begin{array}{cc }       \\nu^t_l & n^{ct}_l\\\\ \\end{array}\\right )      \\left(\\begin{array}{cc }        0 & m^t_n\\\\ m_n & m_r\\\\ \\end{array}\\right )      \\left(\\begin{array}{c }        \\nu_l \\\\",

    "as such , the matrices can be diagonalized by the unitary transformations @xmath24    by forming the hermitian products , calculating the left and right unitary transformations of column eigenvectors , and phase rotating the complex symmetric @xmath19 and @xmath25 matrices , so their mass eigenvalues are real .",
    "the pmns neutrino mixing matrix @xcite is then given by @xmath26 .",
    "on the other hand for later use , it is convenient to transform to the bases where @xmath23 and @xmath19 are diagonal and denoted by primed quantities . in this case @xmath27    where now @xmath28 , since @xmath29 is just the identity matrix .",
    "a comparison of the seesaw diagonalization matrices then reveals that the transformed dirac neutrino matrix @xmath30 in the new basis is given by @xmath31    in terms of the original matrix in the flavor bases .    with either basis ,",

( [ eq : diag ] ) or @xmath40 in eq . ( [ eq : diagbas ] ) .    with this background in mind",
    ", we now turn to a brief discussion of the five @xmath3 models we have considered for our lepton flavor violation study .",
    "the @xmath3 grand unification symmetry is an economical and attractive one @xcite , for all sixteen left - handed quark and lepton fields and their left - handed conjugates fit neatly into one @xmath14 representation per family .",
    "many models exist in the literature which differ from one another by their higgs representation assignments and type of flavor symmetry imposed , if any . to appreciate this ,",
    "it is of interest to note the following decompositions of the direct product of representations : @xmath41    where in the first product the @xmath42 and @xmath43 matrices are symmetric , while the @xmath44 is antisymmetric under the interchange of family indices .    given this group structure for @xmath3 , there are two general classes of models which have been extensively studied . those with higgs in the @xmath45 , and possibly the @xmath44 and/or @xmath46 , dimensional representations are often referred to as the minimal higgs models @xcite and lead to symmetric or antisymmetric matrix elements , or a superposition of the two .",
    "the advantage is that the couplings are renormalizable and preserve r - parity , but the latter representations are of rather high rank and disfavored in the string theory framework .",
    "the other class typically involves the lower rank higgs representations such as @xmath47 , with some non - renormalizable effective operators formed from them , @xcite but r - parity is not conserved .",
    "they can lead to lopsided mass matrices for the charged lepton and down quark mass matrices , due to the @xmath48 structure present in the @xmath14 s .",
    "as such , one may anticipate that they will predict a higher level of lepton flavor violation than the first class .",
    "the @xmath49 triplet components in the higgs representations in all five models considered have no electroweak vev and hence lead to the conventional type i seesaw mechanism with the prediction of normal hierarchy for the light left - handed neutrino spectrum @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on each model in turn but give only the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices .",
    "all successfully predict the observed quark structure and ckm mixings .",
    "this model , based on @xmath3 with a @xmath50 flavor symmetry @xcite , is of the lopsided variety and has matrices of the following textures : @xmath51    where the parameters have the values @xmath52 .",

    "one finds @xmath55    a value of @xmath56 assures that @xmath57 and that the corresponding lopsided nature of the 23 element of the down quark mass matrix gives a good fit to the results for the quark sector .",
    "the @xmath58 elements of the dirac neutrino matrix were added @xcite to the original model to give a better fit to baryogenesis arising from resonant leptogenesis involving the two lighter right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "evolution downward from the gut scale to @xmath59 has little effect on the mixing angles due to the small @xmath60 , the opposite cp - parity of the lighter two right - handed majorana neutrinos , and their large hierarchy with the heaviest one ; but serves to lower the values of the @xmath61 s and @xmath62 and @xmath63 relative to their gut scale values .",
    "this model , based on @xmath3 with a @xmath64 flavor symmetry @xcite , is of the minimal higgs variety leading to symmetric entries in the mass matrices : @xmath65    where @xmath66 gev and the parameters have the values @xmath67 .",

    "the effect of evolution from the gut scale to @xmath59 is to raise @xmath75 and to lower @xmath76 .",
    "this model is based on @xmath3 with an @xmath77 flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the higgs fields appear in six @xmath42 s , three @xmath78 s , three @xmath43 , and one @xmath46 representations of @xmath3 , distinguished by their @xmath77 flavor assignments . of the 14 pairs of higgs doublets at the gut scale ,",
    "all but one pair are assumed to get superheavy .",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix is chosen to be diagonal , while the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix is proportional to the identity matrix , so all three heavy neutrinos are degenerate . the dirac neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices are symmetric and given by @xmath79    m_e & = & \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc } b_0 - 2 b_2 - 3(e_0 - 2 e_2 ) & 0 & 0\\\\            0 & b_0 + b_1 + b_2 - 3(e_0 + e_1 + e_2 ) & 0\\\\            0 & 0 & b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - 3(e_0 - e_1 + e_2)\\\\             \\end{array}\\right),\\\\    \\label{eq : mnmecy } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where the parameters have the values @xmath80 , all in gev . the common mass of the degenerate right - handed neutrinos is determined to be @xmath81 gev , so as to fit @xmath82 with the aid of the seesaw formula .",

    "this model is based on @xmath3 with a @xmath84 family symmetry @xcite . the charged lepton and",
    "down quark mass matrices have lopsided textures , but they are not so extreme as in the case of the albright - barr model : @xmath85    where @xmath66 gev and the parameters have the values @xmath86 .",
    "the right - handed majorana mass matrix is diagonal with mass eigenvalues @xmath87 ,  @xmath88 ,   @xmath89 gev .",
    "these parameters were chosen by making use of the central experimental values for @xmath90 and @xmath91 at the time of writing .",
    "the authors find @xmath92    the evolution has been carried out with @xmath93 and @xmath94 gev down to @xmath59 and then down to the 1 gev scale for the light neutrino masses .",
    "this model is based on @xmath3 with an @xmath95 flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the higgs fields appear in one each of the @xmath42 , @xmath44 , and @xmath78 dimensional representations of @xmath3 .",
    "the fermion mass matrices are generated by renormalizable yukawa couplings of these higgs fields to the three families placed in @xmath14 s .",
    "the dirac neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices are written as linear combinations of the yukawa couplings of the @xmath42 , @xmath44 , and @xmath78 higgs representations , respectively , while the right - handed majorana matrix is proportional only to the latter : @xmath96    where the individual higgs contributions to the mass matrices are given by @xmath97    in the right - left order we have adopted .",
    "the coefficient parameters are taken to be @xmath98 .",
    "a value of @xmath74 is used to evolve the quark and charged lepton masses downward to the electroweak scale .",
    "one finds then that @xmath99    although the results are impressive , the authors do note that 21 parameters have been introduced in order to obtain the results .",
    "hence the model should be viewed as an existence proof that the lepton masses and mixings as well as the quark masses and mixings can be described in the framework of renormalizable couplings with only the three higgs representations contributing to the yukawa couplings .",

    "the branching ratio ranges apply for the @xmath100 case and with the stricter wmap dark matter constraints imposed .",
    "it is clear that the five predictive @xmath3 susy gut models considered have very representative right - handed neutrino mass spectra and predictions for @xmath76 .",
    "the cm , dr , and gk models have massive hierarchical spectra with @xmath6 ranging from @xmath101 to @xmath102 gev . the cy model , on the other hand , has a degenerate spectrum with @xmath103 gev , while the ab model has degenerate @xmath104 and @xmath105 which can lead to resonant leptogenesis .",
    "the cm model has a relatively large @xmath76 prediction which should be observable at the upcoming reactor neutrino experiments , double chooz and daya bay .",
    "the ab , cy and dr models have similar predictions for @xmath76 which will make observation of @xmath106 oscillation somewhat marginal at those reactors and in the proposed no@xmath107a and t2k long - baseline experiments @xcite without a superbeam source . for the gk model , the observation of such a low @xmath76 prediction would only take place with a neutrino factory .",
    "but it is clear from table iii and the previous figures that the gk and ab models will be tested first with the meg experiment . from our discussion",
    "it is then clear that the lfv branching ratios are more sensitive to large @xmath6 than to large @xmath5 in the models considered . in previous generic studies of susy gut models , the rare branching ratios were nearly equally sensitive to each of the two parameters @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest to consider lepton flavor violation in the @xmath109 to @xmath110 conversion process in titanium , @xmath111 .",
    "while there is no such ongoing experiment , preliminary discussion is underway to propose one which will lower the present limit .",
    "we shall see that the conversion rate predictions relative to the muon capture process , @xmath112 , are such that all five models considered in this paper can potentially be eliminated , if no signal is observed .    while predictions for the conversion process in the sm are infinitesimally small , large enhancements in the cmssm framework again occur by virtue of massive super partners appearing in loop diagrams involving @xmath113 and higgs penguins and boxes .",
    "of these , arganda , herrero and teixeira have shown that the @xmath114 penguin contributions dominate the others by at least two orders of magnitude @xcite .",

    "is @xmath122 @xcite . in the case of the conversion process",
    ", we have explicitly carried out the full evolution running from the gut scale to the @xmath123 scale .",
    "the @xmath108 conversion branching ratio is then obtained from the conversion rate above by scaling it with the @xmath109 capture rate on @xmath124 , which is quoted in @xcite as @xmath125 with the present experimental limit on the conversion branching ratio found to be @xmath126 .     branching ratio predictions for @xmath108 conversion _ vs. _ branching ratio predictions for @xmath4 in the five models considered .",
    "only thick line segments are shown reflecting the application of the more restrictive wmap dark matter constraints .",

    "we show a plot of the @xmath108 conversion branching ratio _ vs. _ the @xmath127 branching ratio for each of the five models considered .",
    "we have limited the line segments by applying the wmap dark matter constraints of sec .",
    "it is clear that the gk and ab models would be tested first , followed by the dr , cy and cm models .",
    "in fact , a first generation @xmath108 conversion experiment may be able to reach a branching ratio of @xmath128 , while a second generation experiment may lower the limit from the present value down to @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "if such proves to be the case and no signal is seen , all five models will be eliminated .",
    "hence the conversion experiment is inherently more powerful than the meg experiment looking for @xmath130 which is designed to reach a level of @xmath131 , sufficient only to eliminate the gk and ab models .",
    "the caveat , of course , is that meg is now starting to take data , while no new conversion experiment has been approved to date .",
    "there have been many theoretical models constructed which aim to explain the neutrino masses and mixing patterns . while the predictions for the value of @xmath5 in these models may provide a way to distinguish some of these models , as shown in the survey over 63 models we have carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rare lfv processes , such as @xmath4 and @xmath2 conversion can provide an even more sensitive way to disentangle these models .",
    "we have investigated these rare processes in five susy so(10 ) models that are currently still viable and highly predictive , making use of the allowed parameter space for the soft susy breaking parameters in the cmssm framework . utilizing the wmap dark matter constraints , lower bounds on the branching ratios of these rare processes can be placed , and we find that at least three of the five models considered give rise to prediction for @xmath132 that will be tested at meg .",
    "more interestingly , the next generation @xmath2 conversion experiment should be sensitive to the predictions of all five models , making it an even more robust way to test these models . while generic studies have emphasized the important dependence of the branching ratios on the reactor neutrino angle , @xmath5 , and the mass of the heaviest right - handed neutrino , we find the latter to be by far the more significant in the models tested .",

    "<S> there have been many theoretical models constructed which aim to explain the neutrino masses and mixing patterns . </S>",
    "<S> while many of the models will be eliminated once more accurate determinations of the mixing parameters , especially @xmath0 , are obtained , charged lepton flavor violation experiments are able to differentiate even further among the models . in this paper , we investigate various rare lepton flavor violation processes , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 conversion , in five predictive supersymmetric ( susy ) @xmath3 models and their allowed soft - susy breaking parameter space in the constrained minimal susy standard model . utilizing the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe dark matter constraints , we obtain lower bounds on the branching ratios of these rare processes and find that at least three of the five models we consider give rise to predictions for @xmath4 that will be tested by the meg collaboration at psi . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the next generation @xmath2 conversion experiment has sensitivity to the predictions of all five models , making it an even more robust way to test these models . </S>",
    "<S> while generic studies have emphasized the dependence of the branching ratios of these rare processes on the reactor neutrino angle , @xmath5 , and the mass of the heaviest right - handed neutrino , @xmath6 , we find very massive @xmath6 is more significant than large @xmath5 in leading to branching ratios near to the present upper limits . </S>"
