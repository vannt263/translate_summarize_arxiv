    "the present paper elaborates on the notion of @xmath0-curve of stahl  @xcite and of gonchar and rakhmanov  @xcite . among the many applications of @xmath0-curves ( see for instance section  6.3 of  @xcite and references therein ) , we pay special attention to the theory of nonhermitian orthogonal polynomials @xmath1 @xmath2 the classical theory of orthogonal polynomials corresponds to the hermitian case , in which the integration path @xmath3 is typically a real interval and the weight is a positive real function on @xmath3 . but",
    "more recently the nonhermitian case , in which @xmath3 can be a more general curve in the complex plane and the weight can be a complex function , has received much attention . in the mathematical literature",
    "these polynomials first appeared as denominators of pad and other types of rational approximants  @xcite , but the corresponding theory quickly developed and found applications into such fields as the riemann - hilbert approach to strong asymptotics , random matrix theory  @xcite and , consequently , in the study of dualities between supersymmetric gauge theories and string models  @xcite .",
    "more concretely , our aim is to apply the general theory of @xmath0-curves as developed in  @xcite to study the asymptotic distribution of zeros of orthogonal polynomials and the phase structure of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues as @xmath4 of random matrix problems of the form  @xcite @xmath5 where the eigenvalues of the @xmath6 matrices @xmath7 are constrained to lie on @xmath3 .    throughout our discussion",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is a complex polynomial and @xmath3 is a simple analytic curve connecting two different convergence sectors ( @xmath9 ) at infinity of  ( [ pol1 ] ) .",
    "a fundamental result of gonchar and rakhmanov  @xcite asserts that if @xmath3 is an @xmath0-curve , then the asymptotic zero distribution of @xmath10 exists and is given by the equilibrium charge density  @xcite that minimizes the electrostatic energy ( among normalized charge densities supported on the curve @xmath3 ) in the presence of the external electrostatic potential @xmath11 .",
    "note that the integral  ( [ pol1 ] ) is invariant under deformations of the curve @xmath3 into curves in the same homology class and connecting the same two convergence sectors at infinity .",
    "this freedom to deform @xmath3 means that only for special choices of @xmath3 the asymptotic zero distribution has support on @xmath3 .",
    "according to recent results by rakhmanov  @xcite , given a family of orthogonal polynomials of the form  ( [ pol1 ] ) we can always deform @xmath3 into an appropriate @xmath0-curve .",
    "we use an analytic scheme , to be implemented in general with the help of numerical analysis , based on the study of certain algebraic curves which arise as a direct consequence of the @xmath0-property  @xcite .",
    "these _ spectral curves _ have the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a polynomial such that @xmath14 .",
    "the main parameters that determine the @xmath0-curves and the associated equilibrium densities are the branch points of @xmath15 , which turn out to be the endpoints of the ( in general , several disjoint ) arcs ( cuts ) that support the equilibrium density . systems of equations for these branch points can be formulated in terms of period integrals of @xmath15 and are known in several equivalent forms .",
    "we select one of these forms that in the hermitian case reduces to the system of equations derived in  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cuts are characterized as stokes lines of the polynomial @xmath16 or , equivalently , as trajectories of the quadratic differential @xmath17 . at this point",
    "we use numerical analysis not only to solve the equations for the cut endpoints but also to analyze the existence of cuts satisfying the @xmath0-property .",
    "recently bertola and mo  @xcite and bertola  @xcite have used the notion of boutroux curves to characterize the support of the asymptotic distribution of zeros of families of nonhermitian orthogonal polynomials .",
    "both the calculations of the present paper and the approach of  @xcite do not rely on the minimization of a functional but on the characterization of spectral curves  ( [ eq : c0 ] ) with appropriate cuts .",
    "this characterization is formulated in  @xcite in terms of admissible boutroux curves which are determined from certain combinatorial and metric data in the space of polynomials @xmath18 .",
    "it can be proved that the branch cut structure of admissible boutroux curves consists of arcs satisfying the @xmath0-property and , consequently , the method of  @xcite can also be applied to characterize @xmath0-curves . however , as we explained in the previous paragraph , our calculations are based on an explicit system of equations for the cut endpoints .",
    "in contrast , the generation of nontrivial explicit examples in  @xcite amounts to imposing directly period conditions by means of a numerical algorithm involving the minimization of a functional that vanishes precisely for admissible boutroux curves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : zdop ] we review the basic results on equilibrium densities of electrostatic models under the action of external fields . then we introduce the notions of @xmath0-curve and @xmath0-property , and discuss their relevance to characterize asymptotic zero densities of orthogonal polynomials . to obtain an equivalent but computationally more efficient formulation of the @xmath0-property it is convenient to introduce the complex counterpart of the electrostatic potential .",
    "this formulation leads naturally to the notion of spectral curve . in section  [ sec : ced ] we recall the theoretical background to construct equilibrium densities on @xmath0-curves for a given polynomial @xmath8 and use the theory of abelian differentials in riemann surfaces to derive a system of equations for the cut endpoints .",
    "we also discuss the characterization of cuts as stokes lines and the process of embedding the cuts into @xmath0-curves . in section",
    "[ sec : tcm ] we apply the former results to perform a complete analysis of the cubic model @xmath19 with a varying complex coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "we determine @xmath0-curves and equilibrium densities for the two possible cases corresponding to equilibrium densities supported on one or two disjoint arcs .",
    "our analysis combines theoretical properties with numerical calculations and allows us to characterize critical processes of merging , splitting , birth and death at a distance of cuts . as a consequence",
    "we describe the phase structure of the corresponding families of orthogonal polynomials on different paths @xmath3 .",
    "the consistency of our results is checked by superimposing the cuts and the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials @xmath21 with degree @xmath22 .",
    "thus we find a complete agreement with the gonchar - rakhmanov theorem  @xcite ( theorem  1 below ) . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : gcr ] we briefly discuss a generalization of the @xmath0-property which arises in the study of dualities between supersymmetric gauge theories and string models on local calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "some technical aspects of the theoretical discussion are treated in appendix  a.",
    "according to the general theory of logarithmic potentials with external fields  @xcite , given an analytic curve @xmath3 in the complex plane and a real - valued external potential @xmath23 , there exists a unique charge density @xmath24 that minimizes the total electrostatic energy @xmath25      =      \\int_{\\gamma } |\\rmd z| \\rho(z )   v(z )      -      \\int_{\\gamma } |\\rmd z| \\int_{\\gamma } |\\rmd z'| \\log |z - z'| \\rho(z ) \\rho(z')\\ ] ] among all positive densities supported on @xmath3 such that @xmath26 this density @xmath24 is called the _ equilibrium density _ , and its support @xmath27 is a finite union of disjoint analytic arcs @xmath28 ( cuts ) contained in @xmath3 : @xmath29 in terms of the total electrostatic potential @xmath30 the equilibrium density is characterized by the existence of a real constant @xmath31 such that @xmath32 @xmath33    the property that relates this minimization problem to the asymptotic zero density of orthogonal polynomials is called the _ s - property _ , and was singled out by stahl  @xcite , elaborated by gonchar and rakhmanov  @xcite , and more recently extended by martnez - finkelshtein and rakhmanov  @xcite .",
    "a curve @xmath3 is said to be an _",
    "@xmath0-curve _ with respect to the external field @xmath23 if for every interior point @xmath34 of the support @xmath27 of the equilibrium density the total potential  ( [ loge ] ) satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 denote the two normal vectors to @xmath27 at @xmath34 pointing in the opposite directions . in this case",
    "it is said that @xmath27 satisfies the @xmath0-property .",
    "the condition  ( [ s0 ] ) means that the electric fields at each side are opposite , @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a family of monic orthogonal polynomials on a curve @xmath3 with respect to an exponential weight @xmath39 , @xmath40 here and henceforth we assume that @xmath8 is a complex polynomial of degree @xmath41 @xmath42 and that @xmath3 is an oriented simple analytic curve which as @xmath43 connects two different sectors of convergence of  ( [ pol1b ] ) .",
    "the notion of @xmath0-curve is crucial in the analysis of the limit as @xmath44 of the zero density @xmath45 of @xmath10 .",
    "the following theorem  ( see  @xcite , section  3 ) states the close relation between the asymptotic zero distribution of orthogonal polynomials and the equilibrium densities on @xmath0-curves :    let @xmath38 be a family of orthogonal polynomials on a curve @xmath3 with respect to an exponential weight @xmath39 . if @xmath3 is an @xmath0-curve with respect to the external potential @xmath11 , then the equilibrium density on @xmath3 is the weak limit as @xmath44 of the zero density of @xmath10 .",
    "it often occurs in the applications that the orthogonal polynomials @xmath10 are initially defined on a curve @xmath3 which is not an @xmath0-curve .",
    "this problem raises the question of the existence of an @xmath0-curve in the same homology class of @xmath3 connecting the same pair of convergence sectors at infinity ( and therefore defining the same family of orthogonal polynomials ) .",
    "this question has been recently solved in the affirmative by rakhmanov  ( see  @xcite , section  5.3 ) . note also that although this @xmath0-curve is not unique , the associated equilibrium density is certainly unique .",
    "equilibrium densities on @xmath0-curves are also expected to describe the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution as @xmath44 of random matrix models with partition function  ( [ mm0 ] ) . according to heine s formula  @xcite ,",
    "the polynomials  ( [ pol1 ] ) are the expectation values of the characteristic polynomials of the matrices @xmath7 of the ensemble , @xmath46 in terms of the zeros @xmath47 of @xmath10 and of the eigenvalues @xmath48 of @xmath7 , this result means that the expectation value of the function @xmath49 is the function @xmath50 . therefore it is natural to conjecture that the asymptotic distributions of zeros of @xmath10 and of eigenvalues of @xmath7 coincide .",
    "this conjecture has been rigorously proved in the hermitian case , i.e. , when @xmath51 and the polynomial @xmath8 has real coefficients  @xcite , and indeed orthogonal polynomials are a widely used tool in many aspects of hermitian random matrix theory ( for some recent applications see  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-property can be formulated in a more convenient form to our goals using a complex counterpart of the electrostatic potential  ( [ loge ] ) .",
    "thus , we define @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the analytic function in @xmath54 given by @xmath55 here we assume that the logarithmic branch is taken in such a way that for every @xmath56 the function @xmath57 is an analytic function of @xmath34 in @xmath58 minus the semi - infinite arc of @xmath3 ending at @xmath59 . as usual @xmath60 and",
    "@xmath61 denote the limits of the function @xmath62 as @xmath59 tends to @xmath34 from the left and from the right of the oriented curve @xmath3 respectively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath63 and therefore the equilibrium condition  ( [ cm ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath64 furthermore , it follows from the cauchy - riemann equations that the @xmath0-property  ( [ s0 ] ) is verified if and only if the imaginary part of @xmath65 is constant on each arc @xmath66 of @xmath27 ( usually stated as `` locally constant on @xmath27 '' )  @xcite : @xmath67 note that , in essence , the @xmath0-property embodies the possibility of analytically continuing the derivative of the complex equilibrium potential through the support . in some physical applications  @xcite the values @xmath68 are especially relevant , and equations  ( [ mina1 ] ) and  ( [ s20 ] ) are ( trivially ) restated by saying that @xmath3 is an @xmath0-curve if and only if the complex potential @xmath65 is locally constant on @xmath27 @xmath69 and the constants @xmath70 have the same real part @xmath71    next we will see how equations  ( [ s2 ] ) lead to the notion of spectral curve .",
    "( in section  [ sec : eqendpts ] we will see that equations  ( [ s22 ] ) are essential to formulate the system of equations for the cut endpoints in the multicut case . ) in fact , condition  ( [ s2 ] ) can be rewritten in a form especially suited for practical applications in terms of a new function @xmath15 defined by @xmath72    the complex potential @xmath65 is locally constant on @xmath27 if and only if the square of @xmath15 is a polynomial of the form @xmath73 where @xmath13 is a polynomial of degree @xmath14 .",
    "_ condition  ( [ s2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath74 where @xmath75 and therefore  ( [ s3 ] ) can be written as @xmath76 the function @xmath15 is analytic in @xmath77 and , due to  ( [ rh ] ) , its square is continuous on @xmath27 .",
    "hence @xmath78 is analytic in the whole @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath79 we have that @xmath80 and liouville s theorem implies that @xmath78 is a polynomial of degree @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a polynomial of degree @xmath85 .",

    "in particular , a method of analysis of the phase structure and critical processes for multicut hermitian matrix models was recently presented in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the theoretical background underlying the determination of @xmath0-curves . using proposition  1 ,",
    "we begin by looking for spectral curves  ( [ c1b ] ) where @xmath89 . obviously , the number @xmath90 of possible cuts for a fixed @xmath8 is at most @xmath91 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath78 has only simple or double roots .",
    "the simple roots will be denoted by @xmath92 and the double roots by @xmath93 .",
    "the simple roots @xmath94 will be the endpoints of the cut @xmath66 , and therefore @xmath95 .    to determine the branch of @xmath15 that verifies  ( [ asy ] ) in the @xmath90-cut case , we write @xmath15 in the form @xmath96 @xmath97 and take the branch of @xmath98 such that @xmath99 the factor @xmath100 in  ( [ y1 ] ) is then given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 stands for the sum of the nonnegative powers of the laurent series at infinity . hence the function @xmath15 is completely determined by its branch points @xmath92 , and satisfies @xmath103 our first task is to find a system of equations for the cut endpoints @xmath92 .",
    "we use the theory of abelian differentials in riemann surfaces to find a system of equations satisfied by the cut endpoints ( see appendix  a for definitions and notations ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath7 the hyperelliptic riemann surface associated to the curve @xmath104 we introduce the meromorphic differential @xmath105 in @xmath7 , where @xmath106 is the extension of the function  ( [ y1 ] ) to the riemann surface @xmath7 in terms of two branches of @xmath106 in @xmath7 given by @xmath107 .",
    "the asymptotic condition  ( [ asy ] ) implies @xmath108 since the only poles of @xmath105 are at @xmath109 and @xmath110 , equation  ( [ 1.4 ] ) shows that ( with @xmath111 ) @xmath112 is a first kind abelian differential in @xmath7 .",
    "hence it admits a decomposition in the canonical basis @xmath113 for some complex coefficients @xmath114 .",

    "therefore , we have the following method to find a system of equations for the cut endpoints :    ( 1 ) : :    we start with a function @xmath15 of the form  ( [ y1])([y2 ] )    and use the identity    @xmath132    to determine the double roots @xmath133 of    @xmath78 in terms of the cut endpoints",

    "thus we obtain    @xmath140 equations for the @xmath141 cut endpoints .",
    "( 3 ) : :    finally , to obtain @xmath142 additional equations , we express    the differentials @xmath143 and    @xmath144 in terms of the cut endpoints and solve the    system  ( [ fina ] ) to determine the unknowns @xmath129 as    functions of the cut endpoints and of the coefficients of    @xmath8 .",
    "then , in view of  ( [ idy])([idy2 ] ) we impose    @xmath145    there is an alternative and more intrinsic scheme for finding the cut endpoints using the expressions of the abelian differentials .",
    "indeed , as a consequence of the identities  ( [ nho ] ) ,  ( [ diff1 ] ) and  ( [ diff10 ] ) of appendix  a we have @xmath146 hence if we set @xmath147 in this identity we find @xmath148 in particular for the hermitian case ( see subsection 1.3 ) @xmath149 so that  ( [ ce ] ) simplifies to @xmath150 which is the standard system used in hermitian random matrix models to determine the asymptotic eigenvalue support  @xcite . in section  [ subsec : twocutcase ]",
    "we will illustrate for the usual cubic model how the new terms in the general equations  ( [ ce ] ) are reduced ( via real parts and imaginary parts of periods of abelian differentials ) to the calculation of standard integrals , which in this particular case can be expressed in closed form in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "once a solution of the endpoint equations has been obtained , the @xmath151-function  ( [ y1 ] ) is completely determined .",
    "the next step is to find the cuts @xmath66 connecting the respective pairs of cut endpoints @xmath94 and such that the @xmath24 defined by  ( [ mes ] ) is a normalized positive density and the @xmath0-property on @xmath152 is satisfied .    let us define the function @xmath153 from  ( [ cm ] ) and  ( [ y ] ) we have that the @xmath151-function must satisfy @xmath154 \\\\      & = u(z)-l , \\quad z\\in \\mathbb{c}\\setminus \\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the electrostatic potential  ( [ loge ] ) and @xmath31 is some real constant .",
    "hence , in terms of @xmath156 the equilibrium condition  ( [ cm ] ) reads @xmath157 note that different choices of the base point among the branch points @xmath116 in the integral  ( [ g ] ) lead to conditions equivalent to  ( [ cmp ] ) .",
    "given a root @xmath158 of @xmath78 with multiplicity @xmath159 , there are @xmath160 maximal connected components ( excluding any zeros of @xmath78 ) of the level curve @xmath161 which stem from @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "these maximal components are called the stokes lines outgoing from @xmath158 associated to the polynomial @xmath78 .",
    "stokes lines for a polynomial can not make loops and end necessarily either at a different zero of @xmath15 ( lines of _ short _ type ) or at infinity ( lines of _ leg _ type ) .",
    "therefore , the condition  ( [ cmp ] ) means that the cuts @xmath66 must be short type lines with cut endpoints @xmath94 of the polynomial @xmath78 .",
    "it should be noticed that the function @xmath15 is continuous on those short type lines which are not cuts . in what follows",
    "we will denote by @xmath162 the set of all the stokes lines emerging from the simple roots @xmath94 of @xmath15 and by @xmath163 the set of all the stokes lines emerging from all the roots of @xmath78 .",
    "the positivity of the corresponding density  ( [ mes ] ) also imposes that @xmath164 however , the scheme of the above subsection implies @xmath165 so that  ( [ norm ] ) holds .",
    "therefore if  ( [ cmp2 ] ) is verified on @xmath142 cuts and the total charge on these cuts is smaller than unity , then  ( [ cmp2 ] ) is also verified on the remaining cut .",
    "it is straightforward that if the cuts satisfy  ( [ cmp ] ) and  ( [ cmp2 ] ) then the @xmath0-property is verified on @xmath27 , and that we may characterize @xmath0-curves @xmath3 by imposing the following two additional conditions :    ( s1 ) : :    @xmath3 contains @xmath27 .",
    "( s2 ) : :    @xmath3 does not cross any region of the complex plane    where @xmath166 .    indeed , as a consequence of  ( s1 ) the path @xmath3 verifies the @xmath0-property with respect to the external potential @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , using  ( [ idl ] ) we have that  ( s2 ) implies the condition  ( [ cm1 ] ) , so that @xmath24 is an equilibrium measure on @xmath3 .    to implement condition  ( s2 )",
    "we need an explicit description of the set @xmath167 in the complex plane .",
    "it is helpful to observe that points in the neighborhood of a cut satisfy @xmath166 , while the remaining connected lines of the level set @xmath168 separate regions where @xmath166 from regions where @xmath167 .",
    "these properties can be proved as follows .",
    "from  ( [ g ] ) we have that the derivatives of @xmath169 with respect to the cartesian coordinates are @xmath170 then take for instance a point @xmath171 near to a point @xmath172 of a cut and to the left of the cut ( i.e. @xmath173 ) .",
    "then since @xmath174 and using  ( [ dg ] ) we have @xmath175 the same result is obtained for points",
    "@xmath176 near to a point @xmath177 of a cut and to the right of the cut ( i.e. @xmath178 ) taking into account that @xmath179 .",
    "the corresponding statement for the other connected lines verifying @xmath168 follows similarly using the continuity of @xmath15 on them .",
    "equation  ( [ dg ] ) also shows that if a stokes line @xmath180 emerging from one cut endpoint @xmath94 meets a zero @xmath181 of @xmath15 different from @xmath182 and @xmath183 both partial derivatives of the curve @xmath184 vanish at @xmath181 and therefore @xmath180 has a critical point at @xmath181 .",
    "these situations arise in particular at phase transitions of equilibrium densities in which the number of cuts changes .      in the one - cut case we will drop the general notation and denote the cut endpoints by @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively .",
    "the scheme of section  [ sec : eqendpts ] to determine the cut endpoints reduces to identifying the coefficients of @xmath139 and @xmath187 in  ( [ sh1 ] ) , where @xmath188 the resulting equations for @xmath189 and @xmath190 are often simpler when expressed in terms of @xmath191 moreover , in this case the function @xmath192 is given by @xmath193 to prove this identity we recall the form of the function @xmath194 and look for a decomposition @xmath195 where @xmath196 is a polynomial and @xmath180 a complex constant . differentiating this equation with respect to @xmath34 and multiplying by @xmath98",
    "we get @xmath197 with @xmath198 hence @xmath199 and @xmath200 for a certain complex constant @xmath201 .",

    "the encircled region  9 represents the two - cut region .",
    "similar ( symmetric ) situations arise for the cases of @xmath294 and @xmath295 , for which the two - cut regions are the encircled regions  3 and  6 respectively .    as a check of the consistency of these results with theorem  1 , in figures  [ fig : zd1 ] ,  [ fig : zd2 ] and  [ fig : zd3 ] we superimpose to the graphs of figures  [ fig : pathneg ] ,  [ fig:1 - 10 ] and  [ fig:1 - 9 ] the zeros of the corresponding polynomials @xmath21 with degree @xmath22 , which we have generated by recurrence formulas to minimize numerical errors . in figures  [ fig : zd1 ] and  [ fig : zd2 ] , which exemplify the splitting of a cut , as @xmath20 decreases along the negative real axis and due to the symmetry of the situation , the 24 zeros split evenly into the two sets of 12 zeros following closely the positions of the cuts that correspond to the limit @xmath296 . in figure  [ fig : zd3 ] , which exemplifies the birth and death of a cut at a distance , what we find numerically as the value of @xmath20 descends vertically from @xmath297 to @xmath298 is that all the 24 zeros lie initially on the lower cut @xmath286 , and start travelling upwards one by one , thus populating the upper cut @xmath290 and depopulating the lower @xmath286 .",
    "this behavior is particularly clear in the second graph ( corresponding to @xmath299 ) , in which the fourth zero is `` arriving '' at the upper cut , and in the symmetric graph ( corresponding to @xmath300 ) , in which the 21st zero is `` leaving '' the lower cut .     superimposed to the splitting of a cut in figure  [ fig : pathneg].[fig : zd1 ] ]     superimposed to the splitting of a cut in figure  [ fig:1 - 10].[fig : zd2 ] ]     superimposed to the birth and death of a cut at a distance in figure  [ fig:1 - 9].[fig : zd3 ] ]    a phase diagram for the cubic random matrix model with a two - cut region with the same shape as region  3 in figure  [ fig : ph ] was presented in  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noticing that in terms of the variable @xmath301 the curve  ( [ eq : gabc ] ) looks quite similar to the genus  0 _ breaking curve _ found in  @xcite for the family of orthogonal polynomials associated to the quartic potential @xmath302 however , the curve in  @xcite is only symmetric with respect the real @xmath303-axis , while the curve for the cubic model is symmetric with respect both real and imaginary axes .",
    "another important difference between the curve for the cubic model and that for the quartic model is that for this later there exist genus  0 and genus  1 _ breaking curves _ ( see figure  4 in  @xcite ) , although implicit equations for genus  1 curves are provided only for the symmetric case  @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the @xmath0-property  ( [ s20 ] ) arises in the study of dualities between supersymmetric gauge theories and string models on local calabi - yau manifolds @xmath304 of the form  @xcite @xmath305 where @xmath8 and @xmath13 are polynomials such that @xmath306 .",

    "most of the string model information encoded in @xmath304 can be described in terms of the spectral curve , and its associated complex density  ( [ mes ] ) .",
    "these spectral curves satisfy the condition  ( [ s20 ] ) for the @xmath0-property , but they do not determine an equilibrium density since  ( [ mes ] ) provides in general a complex density . as a consequence the complex electrostatic potential is locally constant on the support of @xmath24 @xmath308 but the real parts of the constants @xmath70 are , in general , different . in this case",
    "the cut endpoints are determined by  ( [ sh1 ] ) ,  ( [ sh2 ] ) and , instead of  ( [ periods ] ) , by the constraints @xmath309 where @xmath24 is the complex density  ( [ mes ] ) and @xmath310 are a given set of nonzero complex values ( t  hooft parameters ) .",
    "finally , instead of the single quadratic differential @xmath311 , in this case @xmath90 in general different quadratic differentials @xmath312 are required to determine the cuts @xmath66 as stokes lines @xmath313 we believe that these more general spectral curves can be characterized and classified using an analysis similar to that of the present paper .",
