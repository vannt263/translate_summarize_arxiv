    "the polaron problem is a paradigmatic topic in condensed matter physics : it concerns the effect of the quantum fluctuations of the surrounding medium on the properties of an impurity immersed in a bath .",
    "the first formulation of the problem is due to landau and pekar  @xcite in their study of the motion of electrons in polar crystals . by using a variational approach valid in the limit of strong coupling",
    "it was shown that the electron becomes eventually trapped in the potential created by the self - induced deformation of the lattice .",
    "frhlich  @xcite proposed an effective hamiltonian , which describes the coupling between charged impurities and longitudinal optical phonons of the lattice , providing the standard model description of the polaron problem .",
    "the ground - state energy of the frhlich hamiltonian was calculated by feynman  @xcite within a variational approach based on path integrals which yields an upper bound that nicely interpolates between the weak - coupling perturbative result and the strong - coupling landau - pekar prediction . after a large amount of theoretical work  @xcite spanning more than four decades , an exact solution of the model by means of diagrammatic monte carlo methods",
    "was finally presented in refs .",
    "remarkably , both the results obtained for the polaron ground - state energy and the effective mass are in very good agreement with feynman s findings .",
    "important generalizations of the frhlich hamiltonian include the holstein model on a lattice  @xcite , electrons coupled to acoustical phonons in a crystal  @xcite and , more recently , impurity particles immersed in a dilute bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) gas  @xcite .    in the context of ultracold atoms the polaron concept has received large attention in its fermionic version , _",
    "i.e. _ an impurity coupled to a fermi sea  @xcite . thanks to the use of a feshbach resonance the @xmath5-wave scattering length between the impurity and the fermions of the bath can be tuned at will and experiments have probed various properties of attractive and repulsive fermi polarons both in 3d  @xcite and in 2d  @xcite , ranging from the weak to the strong - coupling regime and including the polaron - molecule transition .",
    "bose polarons , which involve a bath consisting of a bec and therefore are directly related to the original frhlich model , have also been realized and their dynamics experimentally investigated  @xcite .",
    "however , so far , there have been no studies exploiting feshbach resonances to increase the strength of inter - species interactions , nor measuring basic polaron properties such as their binding energy , lifetime and effective mass . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the self - localization of bose polarons was investigated using mean - field approaches  @xcite as well as feynman s variational method applied to the effective hamiltonian describing the impurity  @xcite .",
    "starting from the frhlich hamiltonian",
    "other studies have focused on the calculation of the radio frequency response of the polaron  @xcite , and of its binding energy and effective mass using renormalization group  @xcite and diagrammatic monte carlo  @xcite methods .",
    "a more microscopic approach based on the t - matrix approximation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite where various quasiparticle properties are calculated for both attractive and repulsive bose polarons close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "similar results are also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a variational ansatz for the wave function of the bath - impurity system .",
    "finally , three - body correlations were explicitly included in the theoretical treatment both at the level of perturbation theory  @xcite as well as within a variational approach  @xcite , giving rise to a significant lowering of the binding energy of attractive polarons .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of bose polarons using a fully microscopic , non perturbative approach , consisting in the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method .",
    "this numerical technique can provide exact results for the ground - state energy and the effective mass of the impurity as a function of the parameters of the hamiltonian describing the inter - species and intra - species interaction potentials and the density of the bosonic bath .",
    "we model these interactions using a hard - sphere potential for the inter - boson repulsion and both a purely repulsive hard - sphere and an attractive square - well potential for the impurity - boson interaction .",
    "in particular , the latter model allows one to investigate situations where the impurity - boson @xmath5-wave scattering length is either positive or negative giving rise to the ground - state attractive and excited - state repulsive branches of the polaron .",
    "our analysis is limited to the case where the mass of the impurity is equal to the one of the bose particles in the medium , but generalizations to include different mass ratios can be easily implemented within the same method .",
    "we investigate the properties of the bose polaron both along the attractive and the repulsive branch .",
    "we find that for small values of the ratio @xmath6 of the impurity - boson to the boson - boson scattering length our results for the binding energy and the effective mass are in good agreement with second - order perturbation theory based on a frlich - like hamiltonian describing the coupling between the impurity and the bath . at the unitary point of resonant impurity - boson scattering ( @xmath7 )",
    "the binding energy is found to scale with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the density of the bath and @xmath4 is the common mass of the particles and the impurity .",
    "we notice that this behavior is similar to the fermi polaron case where the binding energy is proportional to the fermi energy of the bath  @xcite .",
    "the effective mass ratio @xmath8 ranges from values close to one in the weak - coupling limit up to values which remain smaller than two close to the resonant point .",
    "we find no evidence of the self - localization of the polaron , which in studies based on the frhlich model is signaled by an abrupt increase of the effective mass as the coupling strength exceeds a critical value .",
    "we believe that this wrong prediction has to do with the inadequacy of the effective frhlich hamiltonian in the description of the pairing mechanism which takes place close to the resonance where the impurity and one boson from the bath can form a bound state .",
    "we analyze the structural properties of the bosonic bath by calculating the contact parameter which characterizes the short - range behavior of the impurity - boson pair correlation function .",
    "the knowledge of how particles in the bath are distributed around the impurity enables us to evaluate the distortion of the density profile produced by the impurity . within the attractive square - well model",
    ", we find a pronounced peak in the density close to the impurity both on the attractive and on the repulsive branch .",
    "this peak is a result of the pairing induced by the impurity - boson potential .",
    "it is a short - range feature that can not be accounted for by the frhlich hamiltonian which can only describe long - range distortions of the density profile .",
    "an important point to analyze is related to the existence of few - body bound states in vacuum , such as three - body efimov - like states and deeper bound states with more than three particles . at the resonant point",
    "we calculate the energy of the deepest bound state with three and more particles ( _ i.e. _ the impurity plus two or more bosons ) finding evidence that such state exists only up to six particles ( _ i.e. _ the impurity plus five bosons ) .",
    "remarkably , the energy of these self - bound states is in absolute value much smaller than the polaron binding energy which involves the contribution from a large number of particles in the bath .",
    "one should notice that the values we obtained for the ground - state energy of the cluster states as well as the size of the largest cluster greatly depend on the details of the hard - sphere boson - boson potential used in the simulations .",
    "however , we believe that the results for the polaron binding energy at unitarity are universal and only depend on the gas parameter @xmath9 of the bath and the mass ratio between the impurity and the bosons .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we first address the single - polaron problem by introducing the model hamiltonian ( subsection ii - a ) , and by reviewing the perturbation treatment leading to the frhlich - type hamiltonian . here , we also derive the results for the polaron binding energy and effective mass valid in the weak - coupling limit ( subsection ii - b ) .",
    "finally , in subsection ii - c , we briefly review the dmc method and we discuss the different trial wave functions used to describe the attractive and repulsive polaron branch .",
    "the results along the two branches concerning binding energy , effective mass , density profiles and contact parameter are presented in subsection ii - d .",
    "furthermore , subsection ii - e contains a discussion of these results specific of the resonant point for the impurity - boson scattering . in sec .",
    "iii we report on calculations of the binding energy of few - body states in vacuum at the unitary point and on the side of the resonance where a two - body bound state exists . in sec .",
    "iv , we generalize the problem to many impurities obeying bose statistics and we use dmc simulations to validate the perturbative equation of state in the limit of small concentrations bearing some consequences for the phase diagram of binary mixtures .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in sec .",
    "we consider a system of one impurity immersed in a dilute gas of @xmath10 bose particles at @xmath11 described by the following hamiltonian @xmath12 here , the first two terms represent the kinetic and the interaction energy of the bosonic bath consisting of particles of mass @xmath13 and interacting through the two - body potential @xmath14 , which depends on the distance @xmath15 between a pair of bosons .",

    "the molecular binding energy @xmath36 is obtained from the equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",

    "we expect that for such a short - range potential the value @xmath1 of its scattering length is the only relevant parameter for all polaron properties .",
    "we restrict the analysis of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) to the case where the impurity and the bosons in the bath have the same mass : @xmath41 .",
    "the strength of the inter - boson interactions is determined by the gas parameter @xmath9 involving the bosonic density @xmath42 , whereas the intensity of the impurity - boson coupling is given in terms of the ratio @xmath6 of the two scattering lengths .",
    "the problem of a single mobile impurity in a bose gas can be thoroughly investigated using perturbation theory at least in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "the approach is based on the treatment of the bath within the bogoliubov approximation of a dilute bose gas described by the hamiltonian @xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the ground - state energy of the bosonic particles @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the inter - boson coupling constant .",
