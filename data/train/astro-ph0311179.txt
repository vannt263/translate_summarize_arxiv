    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath4[81000 ] @xmath5",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 ) are galaxies which emit the bulk of their energy in the far - infrared ( fir ) and often show signs of interaction , such as tidal tails , multiple nuclei , or disturbed outer envelopes @xcite .",
    "lirgs are considered to be extreme objects , where strong starbursts are induced by galaxy interactions , because in many such objects star formation can account for the infrared emission .",
    "theoretical work supports the idea that interactions play an important role in stimulating starbursts in galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations of merging gas - rich spiral galaxies show that during the merging process , gas clouds lose their angular momentum and flow into the circumnuclear region of the host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting high concentration of molecular gas can fuel star - formation activity in the circumnuclear region .",
    "this is consistent with compact nuclear starbursts and gas condensation in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ;",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath7 ) , as observed in mid - infrared ( mir , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radio continuum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c91 ) , and co emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a nuclear starburst triggered by gas inflow has generally been assumed to be the mechanism for producing enhanced star formation in interacting galaxies .",
    "however , the diversity of star - forming and morphological properties in lirgs , and the details of the physical processes that may enhance star - forming activity , are not fully understood .",
    "for example , several paired systems of lirgs show intense star formation in the region of overlap of the two galaxies @xcite , which is not predicted by numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , some observational studies have suggested that the distribution of star - forming regions in lirgs depends on pair separation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h99 ) , gas content @xcite , or degree of morphological disturbance @xcite .",
    "although these observations yield intriguing clues , the samples are small ( 48 objects ) and the mechanism that determines the distribution of star - forming regions in lirgs remains unclear . as for the morphological properties ,",
    "observational studies of @xmath9 galaxies have revealed a weak dependence of global star - forming properties , such as infrared luminosity and fir color , on the interaction strength or morphological class ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies suggest that in order to better understand the physical processes in interaction - induced star - forming activity it is necessary to determine how the star - forming properties of interacting galaxies depend on the dynamical or physical properties of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "even if objects with similar @xmath4 or fir color are considered , there is a significant variation in morphological appearance .",
    "for example , 2030% of lirgs with 10@xmath10 @xmath7 @xmath11 @xmath4 @xmath11",
    "10@xmath12 @xmath7 are apparently single galaxies , while the remaining objects are closely interacting or merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is unclear why these galaxies are actively forming stars at the same level as strongly interacting galaxies , and whether the single - galaxy lirgs have nuclear starbursts .",
    "the distribution of star - forming regions is expected to be connected to the process by which star - formation activity is enhanced ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore it is important to investigate the distribution of star - forming regions in lirgs and its dependence on morphological , physical , and dynamical properties . for this purpose",
    ", we have undertaken an h@xmath0 imaging survey of lirgs .",
    "in contrast to previous h@xmath0 imaging surveys of interacting galaxies @xcite and infrared - selected galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ahm ; @xcite ) , all of our sample objects are lirgs , and they are not selected based on morphological properties or fir color .",
    "this should enable us to focus on activated star formation , and may be useful for examining the relationships between the distribution of star - forming regions and other properties . as lirgs are dust - rich systems , the h@xmath0 emission , especially the total h@xmath0 flux @xcite , can be significantly affected by dust extinction .",
    "however , @xcite presented evidence that the half - light radius of h@xmath0 emission is a useful indicator of the size of the star - forming region .",
    "therefore , h@xmath0 emission may be used to trace the spatial distribution of star - forming regions within individual galaxies .",
    "an advantage of h@xmath0 emission is its large range of spatial scales , i.e. , it is sensitive to small ( @xmath1 1 ) and large ( @xmath1 1 ) scale emission .",
    "although observations in mir or radio continuum emission can provide the highest spatial resolutions ( @xmath1 01 or smaller ) , such observations are insensitive to diffuse emission ( c91 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can extend well beyond several arcseconds .",
    "continuum images also offer important information , since red images taken through a tunable filter are almost free from emission lines and can therefore be used to trace the distribution of old stars .",
    "this enables a direct comparison of the distribution of old and newly - formed stars .    in   2 , we present the sample selection and the observational details . in   3 , we describe the results of the observations for the individual objects and analyses of the resulting dataset .",
    "the observational results are discussed in   4 , and",
    "the conclusions and summary are given in the final section .",
    "the sample objects were selected from lirgs observed in co emission to enable comparison of our results with the gas content and star - formation efficiency . among the systematic co surveys of lirgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sss ) , our sample objects were selected from sss , where total co fluxes were obtained for 62% of the lirgs in the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( @xmath9 ) bright galaxy sample ( bgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bgs includes galaxies covering nearly the entire sky at galactic latitudes higher than 5@xmath13 with @xmath14(60  ) @xmath5 5.24 jy .",
    "the sss selection criteria result in a sample that is relatively unbiased to any galaxy property .",
    "uncertainties in the co fluxes are typically smaller than 20% .",
    "we selected objects from the sss sample matching the following criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath15 @xmath4 @xmath15 @xmath8 @xmath7 , ( 2 ) no clear evidence for an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , ( 3 ) @xmath16 @xmath15 12000 km s@xmath17 , and ( 4 ) @xmath18 @xmath5 @xmath19 .",
    "no morphological selection was made .",
    "the narrow range in infrared luminosity was chosen to avoid confusion due to the effects of large differences in the classes of star - formation activity , as there is a weak dependence of the half - light radius of h@xmath0 emission on @xmath4 ( ahm ; * ? ? ?",
    "this should aid investigation of the relation between properties of the interacting systems and the distribution of star - forming regions .",
    "in addition , lirgs with @xmath4 @xmath15 @xmath8 @xmath7 are relatively close as compared to ulirgs , making it easier to investigate the distribution of star - forming regions in detail .",
    "we searched for evidence for agn in observational studies that used optical and mir spectroscopy , radio morphology , and hard x - ray emission . based on these criteria ,",
    "a total of 28 objects was selected , and observations were made of 22 of them . among the 22 objects , some ( iii  zw  35 , ngc  2623 ) show liner - like optical spectra @xcite .",
    "however , their radio morphology , large fir / radio and small @xmath20 ratios suggest that star - forming activity dominates the energetics of these objects .",
    "hence , the liner spectra may result from a contribution due to shock heating , possibly driven by superwind activities @xcite .",
    "for all of the sample objects , the fir / radio ratio is similar to or larger than that of normal star - forming galaxies and fairly constant , with a standard deviation of @xmath1 0.14 in @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests that none of the sample objects harbors an energetically dominant agn .",
    "several objects in our sample are in common with those studied in previous h@xmath0 + [ ] imaging surveys of lirgs ; four with ahm ( ngc  1614 , ngc  2623 , ngc  4194 , and ugc  8335 ) , one with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zw  049.057 ) , one with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc  6621/22 ) , and two with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc  1614 and ngc  3110 ) .",
    "the relatively small number of common objects is due to differences in the adopted selection criteria ( ahm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or to different sky coverage @xcite .",
    "the observed objects are listed in table  [ obs_list ] together with their global parameters : gas mass , infrared luminosity , and fir fluxes at 25 , 60 , and 100  determined by sss , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "most of the sample objects are interacting systems , and many of them contain two or more galaxies in the @xmath9 beam ; the fir fluxes may therefore represent the total emission from the component galaxies , and so it is possible that there is no lirg in the system ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to examine this possibility , we searched for radio continuum observations of objects that have nearby companions or are composed of two galaxies .",
    "these objects are listed in table  [ pair_list ] , with @xmath4 for each component galaxy determined by assuming that they both have the same radio - to - fir flux . for mrk  331 ,",
    "no radio information was found for the companion galaxies .",
    "however , as the 100  mapping observation of mrk  331 by @xcite found a flux consistent with the @xmath9 bgs flux , contamination by companion galaxies is considered to be negligible .",
    "of the ten objects listed in table  [ pair_list ] , the first five are paired galaxies included in @xmath9 bgs as interacting systems because of their small separations .",
    "the infrared luminosities of these objects were found to be dominated by one of the member galaxies , and so the analyses in the following sections are made for the dominant galaxy only .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity can also be used to resolve the confusion problem because it is closely correlated to fir luminosity for normal star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in lirgs , the @xmath22 ratio varies over an order of magnitude ( ahm ) .",
    "in contrast , if there is not an energetically dominant agn , the fir / radio ratio is fairly constant , as is the case in our sample .",
    "therefore , we did not use the h@xmath0 luminosity for this purpose .",
    "the h@xmath0 and continuum images were obtained in 1999 december , 2000 january and october , and 2001 april using the f/18 cassegrain focus of the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) 188-cm telescope .",
    "we used the kyoto tridimensional spectrograph i @xcite in imaging fabry ",
    "perot interferometer mode with a 5  gap queensgate et-50 etalon .",
    "this etalon provides bandpasses of 25   at 6598   and 29   at 6929  .",
    "a 45 square field is imaged onto a 1024@xmath231024 tc215 ccd with a pixel size of 12 . by 2@xmath232 on - chip binning , each 24  pixel subtends 0535 on the sky .",
    "observational procedures for the kyoto tridimensional spectrograph i and the system setup are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the central transmission wavelength of the etalon was tuned to the redshifted h@xmath0 emission of each object .",
    "images of the continuum emission were also obtained at the rest - frame wavelengths of 6450  and / or 6650   .",
    "a log of these observations is presented in table  [ obs_log ] , which lists the observed wavelength , the exposure time , and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of field stars .",
    "the contribution of h@xmath0 + [ ] to the continuum image is generally small , estimated to be about 110% for the typically observed h@xmath0 equivalent widths ( ews ) of 10100 .",
    "sixteen of our sample objects were observed by @xcite and their results show that the nuclear [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio ranges from 0.3 to 1.0 .",
    "this means that [ ] emission contributes up to 30% of the obtained h@xmath0 images . a clear example may be iii  zw  35 , which shows , in addition to compact nuclear emission , elongation in the direction of the minor axis , suggesting that galactic - scale outflows may contribute to the h@xmath0 image .",
    "however , the compact distribution of star - forming regions in iii  zw  35 is not greatly affected by the elongated component , and in the following analyses we consider such effects to be generally small .",
    "the images were reduced in the standard manner for narrow - band filter imaging using iraf .",
    "the procedure includes bias subtraction , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic - ray removal and sky subtraction . flux calibrations were made for most of the objects by using data from photometric standard stars taken with the same instrumental setup , although relatively unstable weather conditions caused rather large uncertainties in the calibration .",
    "a comparison of the integrated fluxes with previous h@xmath0 imaging observations ( ahm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in six of the sample objects showed log differences of about 0.3 , and we therefore assumed this value as the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration . no flux calibration was made for ngc  828 , ngc  6090 , and mrk  331 .",
    "spatial registration and correction for the seeing variation were made using the positions and fwhm of field stars .",
    "where reliable corrections for variations of system efficiency with wavelength and atmospheric transmission were not available , the counts of field stars were used to match the flux level of on- and off - band images .",
    "as the off - band images were obtained at both the long- and short - wavelength sides of the h@xmath0 emission , the effect of the color difference between field stars is expected to be small .",
    "the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 and continuum images of the sample objects are shown in figure  [ ha_con_image ] . by taking the ratio of the h@xmath0 and continuum images",
    ", we obtained the h@xmath0 equivalent - width maps , which are also given in figure  [ ha_con_image ] . for objects with an h@xmath0-emitting companion galaxy , the images of the companion galaxies are shown separately in figure  [ companion_image ] .",
    "the images show a large variation in the distribution of h@xmath0 emissions , and analyses of the h@xmath0 images are made in the next subsection .",
    "a description of the results for each individual object is given in the appendix .",
    "in continuum light , the sample objects span a broad range of morphologies from apparently normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  958 ) to nearly complete mergers with strong tidal tails ( e.g. , ngc  2623 ) .",
    "it is notable that in systems of paired galaxies most of the companion galaxies are small as compared to the main galaxies that are the dominant source of fir emission .",
    "we divided the sample objects into several morphological classes in order to facilitate comparisons with the star - forming properties given in the following sections .",
    "morphological classifications have already been made by sss for all of our samples . however , according to their classification , more than half of the galaxies are defined as `` merger '' , partly because their `` merger '' class includes paired galaxies with overlapping disks . therefore , we made our own morphological classification as follows .",
    "objects with strong tidal features and a single nucleus were classified as `` merger '' ( ngc  1614 , ngc  2623 , arp  148 , ngc  4194 ) . paired galaxies with overlapping disks or a connecting bridge",
    "were classified as `` close pair '' ( iii  zw  35 , arp  55 , ugc  8335 , ngc  6090 , ngc  6621/22 ) where the projected separation ranges from @xmath1 4  kpc to 20  kpc .",
    "galaxies which have nearby ( @xmath11 100  kpc ) companion galaxies at the same redshift but no evident overlap between the primary galaxy and its companion were classified as `` pair '' ( ngc  877 , ngc  3110 , ic  2810 , ngc  7771 , mrk  331 ) .",
    "the remaining eight objects were classified as `` single '' .",
    "note that , although the `` single '' objects do not show strong tidal features , many of them show some distorted / asymmetric appearance .",
    "thus , it is possible that some of the `` single '' objects are remnants of mergers or have experienced tidal interactions . in figure",
    "[ ha_con_image ] , the morphological classes are indicated to the left of the h@xmath0 images , where `` m '' , `` c '' , `` p '' , and `` s '' represent `` merger '' , `` close pair '' , `` pair '' , and `` single '' , respectively .",
    "as seen in figure  [ ha_con_image ] , the morphological appearance of lirgs in h@xmath0 is complicated and highly varied . to investigate the distribution of star - forming regions and compare it with physical and dynamical properties , we made `` h@xmath0continuum diagrams . ''",
    "these diagrams plot the h@xmath0 versus red - continuum surface brightness at each galaxy position , and were made for each individual object .",
    "the surface brightness in red continuum light , which is considered to trace old stars , typically decreases with distance from the nucleus , so the diagram demonstrates how the h@xmath0 surface brightness changes with distance from the nucleus and , more specifically , the relative concentration towards the nucleus of h@xmath0 and continuum emission . note that for paired systems , only the main galaxy , that emits most of the fir flux ( see table  [ pair_list ] ) , is shown in the diagram .",
    "the use of continuum surface brightness as an indicator of the distance from the galaxy center has some advantages , in that it is insensitive to variations in galaxy size and inclination ; however , there may be additional uncertainty due to non - axisymmetric features such as bars and spiral arms . in normal spiral galaxies ,",
    "the distribution of h@xmath0 emission is similar to that of white light @xcite , and more extended than @xmath24-band emission @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0continuum diagrams are shown in figure  [ ha_cont ] for all of the objects , where the ordinate and abscissa represent log h@xmath0 and continuum surface brightness in erg s@xmath17 @xmath25 arcsec@xmath26 and erg s@xmath27 @xmath25 @xmath17 arcsec@xmath26 .",
    "for ngc  828 , ngc  6090 , and mrk  331 , the axes are shown in arbitrary units , as we did not make absolute flux calibrations for these objects .",
    "however , in these three objects , the relationship between the ordinate and abscissa is the same as in other objects , and h@xmath0-equivalent widths can be measured .",
    "the abscissa increases leftward , so the galaxy nucleus corresponds to the left edge of the diagram . before making these diagrams ,",
    "the spatial sampling and fwhm of the point spread function were set to common values of 420 pc pixel @xmath17 and 1.43 kpc , respectively , for all of the objects . in the diagrams ,",
    "small dots represent the h@xmath0 and continuum surface brightnesses measured at each pixel of the image .",
    "if the distribution of h@xmath0 and continuum emission are similar , the small dots will be distributed along lines with a slope of 1.0 , as shown in figure  [ ha_cont ] .",
    "these three lines correspond to a constant ew of 20   , 100   , and 500   , respectively . in the upper panel of each diagram , we show the h@xmath0 flux integrated over the regions with the continuum surface brightness given by the abscissa value . each continuum surface - brightness bin has a width of 0.1 in logarithmic scale , and the ordinate is linearly scaled , with the bottom line corresponding to zero h@xmath0 flux . in these plots ,",
    "one can see the contributions to the total h@xmath0 flux from the nuclear and outer regions .",
    "hereafter , they are referred to as `` h@xmath0-flux histograms '' .",
    "the diagrams in figure  [ ha_cont ] are ordered from upper left to lower right by characteristics of appearance , and we classified them as follows .",
    "the h@xmath0-flux histograms of the first eight objects ( iii  zw  35 , ngc  2623 , zw  049.057 , ngc  1614 , ngc  4194 , ugc  8335 , ngc  6090 , and mrk  331 ) show that the total h@xmath0 flux of these objects is dominated by emission from the nuclear region .",
    "the h@xmath0continuum diagrams show a monotonic decline of h@xmath0 surface brightness towards the right - hand side , and the position of the h@xmath0 peak closely matches that of the continuum peak .",
    "in addition , most of the slopes are steeper than 1.0 , i.e. , the h@xmath0 distribution is more sharply peaked than the continuum . in spite of these common properties ,",
    "there are two subgroups with distinctly different h@xmath0 surface brightnesses and ew : iii  zw  35 , ngc  2623 , and zw  049.057 show log @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath29 ( in cgs ) and h@xmath0 ew lower than 20in their nuclei , while the other five objects show log @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath30 and h@xmath0 ew larger than 100 .",
    "hereafter , the former group is referred to as type  1 and the latter as type  2 . in the next six objects (",
    "ngc  23 , ugc  2238 , arp  55 , ic  2810 , ngc  6621 , and ngc  7771 ) , the h@xmath0-flux histograms clearly show that there are significant contributions from the outer regions to the total h@xmath0 flux .",
    "in addition , although the h@xmath0 peaks are located near the nuclei , the spread of the plotted points at the left edge of the h@xmath0continuum diagrams indicates that the h@xmath0 peaks are displaced from the continuum peaks .",
    "we call this class of objects type  3 .",
    "the next seven objects ( ngc  695 , ngc  828 , ngc  834 , ngc  877 , ngc  958 , ngc  3110 , and ngc  5653 ) are galaxies in which most of the h@xmath0 emission comes from the outer regions .",
    "many of them have the strongest h@xmath0 emission far from the nucleus and show a more extended distribution of h@xmath0 than of continuum emission .",
    "these objects are type  4 .",
    "arp  148 does not match any of the types described above .",
    "this may be due to the apparent double components in continuum light , probably caused by heavy dust extinction at the nucleus , which is located halfway between the components ( see appendix  [ section_a148 ] ) , or it may be related to the peculiar appearance of the large off - center ring . in any case , arp  148 is not included in any of the above types and is treated as an exceptional object .",
    "to parameterize the distribution of h@xmath0 emission , we also calculated the peak surface brightness to total flux ratio ( @xmath31 ) and the h@xmath0-emitting area ( @xmath32 ) in the spatial - resolution and -sampling adjusted images .",
    "@xmath31 measures the relative importance of the nuclear region to the disk region in star - forming activity and was used by h99 as a measure of the concentration of mir emission .",
    "@xmath32 is defined as the total area of emission - line region(s ) brighter than a threshold value of surface brightness .",
    "we adopt a value of 3.5 @xmath23 10@xmath33 erg s@xmath17 @xmath25 arcsec@xmath26 for the threshold , which is well above the background noise for most of the images . in practice",
    ", @xmath32 can be used to distinguish whether star - forming activity is confined to the nuclear region or extends to the outer regions .",
    "the global properties and the parameters of the h@xmath0 distribution are listed in table  [ global_prop ] , and table  [ global_differ_table ] lists the mean and standard deviation of these values for each type . in these tables , @xmath34 is the spectral curvature at 60 defined by c91 as the difference in the spectral indices , @xmath35 .      from table",
    "[ global_differ_table ] , it is clear that the classification based on the diagrams in figure  [ ha_cont ] is associated with the physical characteristics of star - forming activity .",
    "for example , the star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) , measured by @xmath36 @xcite , and the dust temperature , estimated from the @xmath37 ratio , are significantly higher in type  1 and type  2 than type  3 and type  4 objects . in addition , type  1 objects generally show exceptionally large or small values in @xmath32 , @xmath38 , @xmath22 , and @xmath34 relative to the other types .    more evidence for differences between the types of galaxy is given by the @xmath39@xmath40 , @xmath34@xmath41 , and @xmath42@xmath41 diagrams shown in figure  [ global_differ ] .",
    "these diagrams illustrate that different types occupy different parts of the diagrams .",
    "the diagrams also indicate that objects of the same type have surprisingly similar star - forming properties . in the following sections , we summarize the observational properties of each type and attempt to reveal the nature of star - forming activity in them .",
    "figure  [ global_differ]b shows a positive correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath41 with a correlation coefficient of 0.88 . as shown by c91 , lirgs also show a definite positive correlation between @xmath34 and `` hybrid surface brightness '' , which was defined as the ratio of the total 60  flux and the angular area in 8.44  ghz or 1.49  ghz emission of an object .",
    "the correlation shows that objects with large @xmath34 tend to have a compact radio source , and therefore a large hybrid surface brightness .",
    "c91 concluded that the large values of @xmath34 in compact radio sources result from large optical thicknesses at @xmath43 @xmath15 25 . in these sources ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emission may also suffer from strong dust extinction , resulting in the large @xmath22 values .",
    "therefore , the correlation in figure  [ global_differ]b suggests that the variations in @xmath34 and @xmath41 in our sample objects are dominated by the variations in the amount of dust extinction .",
    "if this is the case , we note that in figure  [ global_differ]b the type  1 objects suffer the strongest dust extinction and the type  4 objects suffer the weakest .",
    "the type  1 and type  2 objects are characterized by warm dust temperatures ( large @xmath37 ) , large sfe ( @xmath36 ) , and strongly concentrated h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this means that these galaxies are forming stars actively in their nuclear regions .",
    "in addition to the above properties , the type  1 objects show extreme properties also in other observational quantities , i.e. , they have the largest @xmath4/@xmath44 and @xmath34 , and the smallest @xmath32 and @xmath38 among the four types .",
    "the small @xmath32 indicates that the star - forming activity in these objects is confined to their nuclei , and little star formation occurs in the outer regions , as is clearly seen in the original images of figure  [ ha_con_image]b , j , r. the large @xmath34 suggests that these objects have compact nuclear star - forming regions , as noted in   [ section_type_property ] .",
    "actually , ngc  2623 and iii  zw  35 , two of the type  1 objects , were observed by c91 and described as `` dominated by compact radio components . ''",
    "the physical size of the compact components is about 100  pc . in zw  049.057 , another type  1 object , the radio continuum emission at 1.49  ghz",
    "is dominated by a nuclear source with an estimated diameter of 05 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath1 100  pc .",
    "the strong dust extinction for nuclear star - forming regions , as deduced from the large @xmath22 and @xmath34 , may have the effect of decreasing the observed h@xmath0 emission , causing the faint h@xmath0 surface brightnesses and small ew in these objects .",
    "as for the gas content , the mean value of @xmath38 is a factor of two smaller than for the other types , although dispersions are large .",
    "the h@xmath0-flux histograms of type  2 objects are similar to those for type  1 objects .",
    "however , the morphologies observed in the original images clearly differ : while the h@xmath0 and continuum images of type  2 objects are similar in the nuclear region , those of type  1 objects are not .",
    "moreover , high resolution radio / mir observations reveal the following difference in the distribution of star - forming regions between the two types .",
    "ugc  8335 was observed by c91 and clearly shows an extended structure with a size of @xmath1 1  ( @xmath1 600 pc ) , in contrast to iii  zw  35 and ngc  2623 , which are dominated by compact radio components as noted above .",
    "in addition , the star - forming regions in ngc  1614 , ngc  4194 , ngc  6090 , and mrk  331 are known to be spatially extended to several hundred parsecs or 1  kpc @xcite .",
    "thus , it would appear that although both type  1 and type  2 objects show dominant nuclear starbursts , the nuclear star - forming regions are slightly larger in type  2 objects than in type  1 objects .",
    "the bright h@xmath0 surface brightness and the large ew in type  2 objects may be the result of a strong concentration of star - forming regions and relatively small dust extinction , as inferred from small @xmath22 .      as seen in the h@xmath0continuum diagrams , objects of this type show active star formation in their nuclear region .",
    "however , there is a substantial contribution from the outer regions to the total h@xmath0 flux .",
    "in addition , the dust temperature and sfe are lower than for the two types above .",
    "examination of the original h@xmath0 images revealed that all of the type  3 objects have bright outer star - forming regions that are extended on scales of 10  kpc .",
    "the significant contributions from the outer regions seen in the h@xmath0-flux histograms originate in these star - forming regions .",
    "these are associated with the disks ( ngc  23 , ugc  2238 , ic  2810 , and ngc  7771 ) , the tidal tail ( arp  55 ) , or the overlap region ( ngc  6621 ) .",
    "in addition , they all show slight offsets of the order of 1  kpc between the h@xmath0 and continuum peaks .",
    "the offsets are not artificial effects due to incorrect subtraction of continuum emission , because most of them show significant differences in their nuclear surface - brightness profiles even between the on- and off - band images , i.e. , before the subtraction of continuum emission . in ngc  7771",
    ", there is a circumnuclear starburst ring with a diameter of @xmath1 1.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "although the ring can not be seen in our h@xmath0 image , probably because of the coarser spatial resolution , the offset between the h@xmath0 and continuum peaks in ngc  7771 is clearly due to the presence of the starburst ring ( see appendix  [ section_n7771 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the nuclear star - forming regions in the other type  3 objects are also extended on scales of 1  kpc or larger .",
    "if this is the case , the size of the nuclear star - forming region in these objects is similar to or larger than the adjusted point spread function , having a fwhm of 1.43  kpc . that the nuclear star - forming regions are slightly larger in size than the point spread function naturally explains why , in spite of the nearly identical range of star - formation rates ( @xmath4 ) , the type  3 objects have fainter nuclear h@xmath0 surface brightnesses ( typically by a factor of ten ) and smaller ew than type  1 objects .",
    "the reduced peak surface brightness and the large contribution from the outer regions to the total h@xmath0 flux may cause the smaller values of @xmath31 as compared to type  1 and type  2 objects ( figure  [ global_differ]c ) .      as noted in ",
    "[ section_ha_con_diagram ] , the total h@xmath0 fluxes of the type  4 objects are dominated by emission from extended star - forming regions .",
    "they have small @xmath31 , low dust temperatures , and small sfe and @xmath4 ( table  [ global_differ_table ] ) .",
    "these properties indicate that the star - forming activity in these objects is relatively mild as compared with the other types .",
    "it is probably because of this that observations of these objects have been very limited in the literature to date .",
    "a remarkable characteristic of the distribution of star - forming regions in the type  4 objects is their knotty and asymmetric appearance .",
    "in particular , ngc  834 and ngc  5653 have a dominant extra - nuclear h@xmath0 source , which results in large values of @xmath31 as compared to the other type  4 objects ( see figure  [ global_differ]c ) .",
    "it is notable that all of the type  4 objects show small values of @xmath22 ( figure  [ global_differ]b , c ) , suggesting that the amount of dust extinction in these objects is relatively small .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the relative faintness of their nuclei in h@xmath0 is due to suppression by strong dust extinction .",
    "we examined this question in more detail by searching for images that trace the star - forming regions and are relatively insensitive to dust extinction .",
    "as noted in appendix  [ section_n5653 ] , the pa@xmath0 image of ngc  5653 @xcite shows features that are nearly identical to our h@xmath0 image . in figure",
    "[ condon ] , we compared the distribution of h@xmath0 in ngc  695 and ngc  3110 with 1.49-ghz radio continuum maps @xcite with matched spatial resolution of @xmath1 5 .",
    "apart from a slight offset of the peak position in ngc  695 , the overall appearance in h@xmath0 and radio continuum emission is similar in the two galaxies .",
    "moreover , the radio emission extends beyond 10  kpc , and the total flux is dominated by emission from the outer regions as in h@xmath0 . in this respect , they are distinctly different from the other types , most of which show dominant nuclear sources in radio continuum emission . therefore , the star - forming activity in the type  4 objects is probably dominated by an extended starburst rather than a nuclear one .    the type  4 objects account for an appreciable fraction of our 60  flux - limited sample of lirgs : 32% in the whole sample and 46% in the lower luminosity range , @xmath4",
    "@xmath15 @xmath45 @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests that , in addition to nuclear starbursts , star formation extending to several kiloparsecs is another attribute of star - forming activity in lirgs .",
    "in   [ section_ha_con_diagram ] , it is shown that the size of the nuclear star - forming region increases from type  1 , through type  2 , to type  3 objects . in the type  3",
    "objects , there are substantial contributions from the outer regions to the total h@xmath0 flux . the star - forming activity in the type  4 objects is dominated by extended starbursts . if the distribution of molecular gas clouds is similar to that of star - forming regions , the density of gas clouds may also vary from type to type , being highest in the type  1 objects and lowest in type  4 objects .",
    "the higher density of gas clouds in galaxies with compact star formation will lead to a higher sfe , because of the non - linear dependence of the star - formation rate on gas density @xcite .",
    "the high efficiency of star formation will then produce more photons to heat the dust and , consequently , raise the dust temperature @xcite . in figure  [ global_differ]a , galaxies with a strong concentration ( type  1 and type  2 ) show the largest values of @xmath37 , i.e. , the highest dust temperature , whereas galaxies that are dominated by extended starbursts ( type  4 ) show the smallest values , with type  3 lying between the two extremes .",
    "except for type  1 , the @xmath20 ratio shows a similar tendency to @xmath37 , although the difference between the types is less clear .",
    "the small values of @xmath20 in the type  1 objects are also expected to be caused by the compact distribution of nuclear star - forming regions , as discussed in ",
    "[ section_type12 ] .",
    "therefore , the difference in the distribution of star - forming regions between the types can explain their segregation in figure  [ global_differ]a .",
    "in addition to the compactness of the nuclear star - forming regions ( @xmath1 100 pc ) , the type  1 objects are remarkable in the small amount of molecular gas present and the nearly complete lack of star - forming activity in the outer regions .",
    "these properties suggest that they are in a late stage in the star - formation history of lirgs @xcite , and that most of the remaining gas has fallen to the nuclear region .",
    "in addition , all of the type  1 objects are either oh megamaser sources or oh absorbers .",
    "this suggests that there is a strong radio source in the type  1 objects , located behind an extended molecular - gas screen .",
    "it is notable that , although lirgs with @xmath22 as large as type  1 are rare , arp  220 , the prototypical ulirg , shows comparably faint h@xmath0 emission and large @xmath22 ratio ( ahm ) .",
    "the fir color and the presence of an oh megamaser source in arp  220 are also similar to type  1 objects .",
    "thus , it is probable that , as in arp  220 , the energy source of type  1 objects is a compact starburst deeply embedded in dusty molecular clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "this would cause the large @xmath22 and the small @xmath20 seen in type  1 objects .    from the above discussion",
    ", we conclude that differences in the distribution of star - forming regions causes the differences in star - forming properties among the types of object .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath0continuum diagram combined with the h@xmath0-flux histogram ( figure  [ ha_cont ] ) is a useful tool for investigating the properties of star - forming activity in lirgs .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the relationship between star - forming properties and the morphological class of the sample objects . as the object types defined in ",
    "[ section_ha_con_diagram ] were found to be strongly correlated with the distribution and global properties of star formation , it may be useful to compare our type classification with the morphological class of the galaxies .    in figure  [ morph_type_hist ] , histograms of the types",
    "are shown for each morphological class .",
    "the type  1 and type  2 objects are relatively small in number and are both dominated by nuclear starbursts , so the objects of the two types are combined and labeled as `` type 1/2 '' in figure  [ morph_type_hist ] .",
    "the morphological classes are defined in   [ section_hacon_image ] .",
    "dynamical disturbance due to galaxy interactions is expected to be the strongest in `` mergers '' and to gradually become weaker in the order `` close pairs '' , `` pairs '' , and `` singles '' .",
    "therefore , figure  [ morph_type_hist ] implies that the more severely disturbed objects tend to have a more compact distribution of star - forming regions .",
    "although there are several exceptions to this rule , we suggest that the degree of dynamical disturbance plays an important role in determining the distribution of star - forming regions .    from mir imaging of seven lirgs with morphological properties indicating the early / intermediate stages of merging",
    ", h99 found that the peak - to - total flux ratio , which is a measure of the concentration of star - forming regions ( see   [ section_ha_con_diagram ] ) , increases as the projected separation of the interacting pairs becomes smaller .",
    "morphologically , their entire sample corresponds to the class of `` close pairs '' in our classification scheme , and their fir colors are similar to our type  2 and type  3 objects . in addition , the objects with larger projected separations have fir colors similar to type  3 objects , and the objects with smaller projected separations have fir colors similar to type  2 objects .",
    "therefore , h99 s and our results are complementary : whereas h99 revealed the detailed dependence of the distribution of star - forming regions on the interaction stage in a morphologically selected sample , our results show that the dependence can be extended to a sample with a broader range of morphological properties .",
    "h99 interpreted their results as a manifestation of the evolutionary sequence : as the merging process advances , star formation becomes more active and develops a more concentrated distribution .",
    "a similar interpretation may also be applicable to our sample , with the exception of the single galaxies .",
    "this issue will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also found connections between dynamical states and the distribution of star - forming regions . from imaging fabry  perot observations of four ulirgs , @xcite found that the h@xmath0 emission is more spatially concentrated in the later stages of a galaxy interaction .",
    "@xcite found that relatively undisturbed systems show evenly distributed mir and h@xmath0 emission in the disks of component galaxies , while severely disturbed objects show dominant nuclear components and enhanced emission in the overlap regions of the pairs .",
    "as the star - forming activity of their sample objects differs significantly from ours , we do not make detailed comparisons with these studies .",
    "nevertheless , it is notable that these studies obtained qualitatively similar results to ours .",
    "therefore , it is almost certain that the strength of dynamical disturbance plays a critical role in determining the distribution of star - forming regions .",
    "our sample size , the restricted range of star - formation rates , and the broad range of morphological properties of our sample objects explain why such a clear relation emerges in figure  [ morph_type_hist ] .    with respect to global star - forming properties , several statistical studies of @xmath9 galaxies , covering a wide range of morphological properties , have shown that they are weakly connected to the interaction strength ( e.g. , sss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that this is because the interaction strength controls the distribution of star - forming regions : the stronger the dynamical disturbance , the more compact the region to which the star - forming activity is confined , resulting in the more extreme properties of higher sfe and higher dust temperature .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the relation between the type and the star - formation history of lirgs .",
    "there are remarkable differences in the size of nuclear star - forming regions and in the relative contribution of the outer regions to the total h@xmath0 flux between the different types of galaxy .",
    "these properties , combined with the connection between type and morphological class , suggest a sequence in the distribution of star - forming regions in interacting galaxies . at an early stage of interaction ,",
    "active star formation occurs in both the nuclear and outer regions ( type  3 ) . as the process of interaction proceeds , the infall of gas clouds activates nuclear star formation , making it the dominant energy source of the system ( type  2 ) . by the final phase ,",
    "most of the gas clouds have fallen into the nuclear region , and the star - forming activity is confined to the nucleus ( type  1 ) . in this process , the size of the nuclear star - forming region also becomes gradually smaller .",
    "the evolutionary sequence above is similar to that described by @xcite , which invokes star formation induced by cloud - cloud collisions @xcite . in their sequence ,",
    "the cloud collision rate is increased by tidally enhanced velocity dispersion in the individual disks in the initial phase , later by the passage of the disks through each other , and lastly by concentration of the gas at smaller radii in the merged nucleus .",
    "therefore , star formation in the outer regions is expected to be important at an earlier phase of galaxy interaction , which is consistent with the observed sequence described above .",
    "as for the variation in size of the nuclear star - forming regions , a probable cause of the slightly larger ( @xmath3 1 kpc ) size in type  3 objects is a nuclear resonance ring , such as that observed in ngc  7771 ( see   [ section_type3 ] ) .",
    "the circumnuclear star - forming ring might shrink with time as a result of the combined effect of a non - axisymmetric potential and the self - gravity of gas @xcite or due to the friction exerted by background stars on gas clouds @xcite .",
    "the timescale of these processes is of the order of @xmath46 years .",
    "as this is shorter than the merger timescale ( @xmath1 @xmath47 years ) , and in some cases strong gaseous inflows can occur at early stages of galaxy interactions @xcite , interacting galaxies in the type  3 phase can evolve into the type  2 or type  1 phase before the final merger .",
    "therefore , the absence of a one - to - one correspondence between the morphological class and the type ( figure  [ morph_type_hist ] ) does not conflict with this evolutionary sequence .    since @xmath4 may vary significantly throughout the star - formation history of lirgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , type  3 objects may not evolve simply into type  2 and then into type  1 .",
    "our suggestion is that the distribution of star - forming regions in interacting galaxies follows the sequence above and , during some phases , the galaxies are recognized as lirgs .",
    "although this evolutionary model seems to succeed in explaining the processes that occur in the evolution of the distribution of star - forming regions , detailed studies of individual objects are needed to examine the validity of these conclusions .",
    "as many of the type  4 objects are singles , we consider them separately . with the exception of ngc  828 , the star - forming activity in type  4 objects is characterized by either prominent spiral arms ( ngc  877 , ngc  958 , ngc  3110 ) or the brightest h@xmath0 source being located in the outer regions ( ngc  695 , ngc  834 , ngc  5653 ) , with both of these groups showing a knotty appearance in h@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , their morphological properties are related to the distribution of star - forming regions .",
    "all of the objects with prominent spiral arms have a small companion at a projected separation of 2030  kpc , assuming that the faint galaxy @xmath1 70  southeast of ngc  958 has the same redshift as ngc  958 .",
    "the other objects have peculiar morphologies , with no galaxy - like object within a projected radius of 100  kpc .",
    "since strong spiral arms can be induced by the presence of a small companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this result suggests that the star - forming activity in the first group is enhanced by the presence of such tidally excited spiral arms .",
    "however , it is unclear whether such a process is efficient enough to induce active star formation and produce a lirg . as for the latter group , in spite of",
    "the fact that they appear to be isolated galaxies , the structural peculiarities and the asymmetric distribution of star - forming regions suggest that their star - forming activity is also induced by galaxy interactions .",
    "this result could be explained if they are remnants of either minor mergers or high speed tidal encounters .",
    "the lack of detailed observational information about the type  4 objects makes it difficult to examine these possibilities .",
    "two - dimensional kinematic observations are needed to reveal the nature of these objects , and may be useful in further developing our understanding of star - forming activity in lirgs .",
    "in order to investigate the relation between the distribution of star - forming regions and galaxy interactions , h@xmath0 imaging observations of twenty - two lirgs were carried out using an imaging fabry - perot interferometer .",

    "ngc  23 ( figure  1a ) is a barred spiral galaxy paired with ngc  26 , a spiral galaxy , with an apparent separation of @xmath1 92 ( @xmath1 160 kpc ) . in the h@xmath0 image , ngc  23",
    "shows a bright nuclear component and extended emission having the appearance of an integral sign .",
    "the nuclear - component has an asymmetric shape with a peak position in h@xmath0 offset by 17 to the west of the nucleus . in the h@xmath0 equivalent - width map ,",
    "a ring - like feature that surrounds the nucleus at a radius of @xmath1 7  ( @xmath1 2 kpc ) is seen .",
    "this means that the h@xmath0 distribution is less sharply peaked than the continuum in the nuclear region .",
    "the continuum source located @xmath1 30  southeast of the nucleus is a foreground star .",

    ", it appears compact but slightly elongated in the direction of the minor axis .",
    "the southern galaxy also shows clear elongation along a p.a . of @xmath1 23@xmath13 .",
    "although the two galaxies have comparable fluxes in h@xmath0 , the majority of the radio continuum ( and also probably fir ) emission originates in the northern galaxy @xcite .    from optical emission lines ,",
    "the nucleus of the northern galaxy is classified as a liner and the southern one as an nucleus @xcite .",
    "the morphological appearance in radio continuum emission suggests that star - forming activity dominates the energetics of the northern galaxy @xcite ; the classification as a liner may be due to a contribution from shock heating , possibly driven by superwind activity @xcite .",
