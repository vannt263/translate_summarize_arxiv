    "[ section : intro ]    one of the great surprises in the search for worlds orbiting other stars was the discovery of a class of close orbiting extrasolar giant planets ( cegps ) .",
    "the existence of such objects did not fit with the formation scenarios used to explain the arrangement of planets in our own solar system .",
    "even before the first extrasolar gaseous giants were discovered , core accretion models predicted that they should only form @xcite at distances similar to those of the giant outer planets @xcite . here",
    "temperatures must be cool enough to enable the formation of an ice ( water , methane and ammonia in solid or liquid form ) core from the proto - planetary disk before gas accretion onto the core can then take place .    with the announcement of the discovery of the first cegp orbiting the f8 dwarf 51 peg @xcite at a distance of only 0.05 au came the realisation that existing theories of planetary formation needed to be revised .",
    "@xcite argued , contrary to conventional belief @xcite , that gas giant planets could survive in such close proximity , although their formation beyond the ice point was still required .",
    "mechanisms to enable an exchange of angular momentum to take place in a proto - planetary disk are believed to be responsible for the spiralling into and eventual halting of planets in a close orbit @xcite .",
    "planetary atmospheric physics research in recent years has been motivated by the expectation that radiation processed by a large body close to its parent star should be detectable with modern instrumentation .",
    "the first clear detection of sodium in the atmosphere of @xcite revealed a lower than expected concentration when compared with a cloudless planetary atmosphere .",
    "several explanations for the lack of sodium were put forward , including the possible presence of a high cloud deck .",
    "no observations had been able to differentiate between the possibility of no clouds ( combined with lower sodium abundance ) until recent spitzer observations of hd 209458b with the low resolution spectrometer irs @xcite indicated a spectral feature consistent with a high silicate cloud deck @xcite .     the reflected light spectroscopic studies carried out by @xcite and more recent results from most photometry @xcite place albedo _",

    "these are somewhat lower than the solar system gas giants , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune , which possess geometric albedos of 0.46 , 0.39 , 0.60 and 0.58 respectively @xcite .",
    "these observed albedo limits for cegps rule out the high silicate cloud investigated in the models of @xcite , and contradict more recent spitzer observations @xcite .",

    "these observations are consistent with the @xcite base model .",
    "@xcite found that the cegp yielded an even higher contrast ratio ( log@xmath11 at 24 ) due to the close orbit and later spectral type of the k2v star .",
    "8 of @xcite plots a comparison of observed and predicted star - planet contrast ratios covering the spectral region . the and tres-1 observations are consistent with the models , with a 2.2  signal strength of 0.1% , whereas scaling the signal suggests a signal strength as high as 0.2% .",

    "instead , we used a spectrum generated from a hitran line list @xcite to identify corresponding features in an observed spectrum of the telluric standard star , .",
    "we used the simple emission line fitting routine emlt in the starlink figaro package to fit gaussians to the inverted spectra in order to identify the positions and width of the lines .",
    "the latter were used as uncertainties in the measurements . by fitting a cubic polynomial to the 12 identified telluric lines ( fig .",

[ fig : planet_spectrum ]      [ section : extracting ] we first constructed a high s / n ratio master stellar spectrum template to accurately subtract the unshifted starlight from each observed spectrum .",
    "this has the additional benefit of removing ( to first order ) the telluric water vapour lines prevalent in this part of the spectrum . by monitoring the strengths of the telluric lines alone",
    ", we found , as expected , that they vary in strength throughout the night , generally being stronger when was observed at high airmass .",
    "the telluric lines did not all behave in this way however , with some lines weaker than the mean at times while others were stronger . using a single master frame comprising both stellar and telluric lines left residuals of up to 5-@xmath2 times the expected noise level after subtraction of the starlight from each spectrum .",
    "instead we made individual use of the bright star , , which contains only telluric lines in the observed spectral range of our data .",
    "this star was observed at regular intervals on each night of observations .",
    "a mean telluric template spectrum was created for each night of observations by aligning and coadding all the spectra observed throughout that night .",
    "the telluric spectrum was fitted to each spectrum by taking derivatives of the spectra and using splines to calculate the scale factor at points across the spectra .",
    "this process can account for lines which behave independently over the night ( i.e. all telluric lines do not necessarily vary in strength by the same factor at any given time ) and is described in @xcite ( appendix a ) .",
    "the procedure provides a spectrum which closely matches the telluric lines for each observed spectrum and is used to divide out these features , leaving only stellar and planetary features .",
    "a master stellar - plus - planet spectrum is then created for each telluric corrected observation , but excluding the current telluric corrected spectrum .",
    "every stellar - plus - planet spectrum is then divided by an aligned and shifted version of the current master stellar - plus - planet spectrum in order to remove the stellar lines . since a planetary signal",
    "is doppler shifted according to phase relative to the stellar lines only the planetary signature should remain .",
    "the master stellar - plus - planet spectrum which is subtracted from each spectrum in turn contains a blurred copy of the planetary signal .",
    "this will thus attenuate the planetary signal in the frame on which subtraction is being performed , to some degree .",
    "the effect is worst at @xmath40 & @xmath41 where the planet moves very little in velocity space from spectrum to spectrum .",
    "the attenuation correction applied to the matched travelling gaussian used to model the planetary motion when searching for a signal is described in detail in  6 and appendices d2 & d3 of @xcite .",
    "we found however that further time varying systematic residuals remained in the spectra and believe that these remaining residuals are due to the time varying ripple which we were unable to remove from the spectra at the extraction stage .",
    "since we remove this effect using splines , we expect time varying differences in the fits which do not exactly match the observed changes in the ripple pattern due to finite signal to noise in the data .",
    "we therefore implemented a method which removes the residual signal which we treat as pattern noise .",
    "this method using principal component analysis is described by @xcite ( appendix b ) and removes time varying patterns at fixed positions in the spectra .",

    "[ section : discussion ]    the methods employed in this paper provide a very encouraging indication that a planetary signal can potentially be extracted from high resolution timeseries spectra .",
    "the fact that we do not detect a signal can be attributed largely to systematic noise introduced from difficulties in consistently normalising each spectrum in our timeseries .",
    "this arises largely because of the systematic and varying large scale flat fielding errors associated with the detector employed in the observations as discussed in ",
    "[ section : data_reduction ] .",
    "we have shown that the feature detected in our spectra is unlikely to be a real planetary feature since its strength is much reduced when additional principal components , which describe ( systematic ) trends in the data , are removed .",
    "the eigenvector describing the contribution of principal components shows a very strong contribution from the first 2 components with an exponential decay which levels off after the 7th principal component . at this level ,",
    "the detected feature becomes consistent with the shot noise in the spectra .",
    "the performance of nir detectors is clearly of great importance if we wish to detect small signals dominated by a nearby bright object .",
    "more modern detectors such as the 1024@xmath67 array used in conjunction with nirspec at keck  2  @xcite do not show the characteristics @xcite of the older array used to secure the data in this work .",
    "future detectors promise even greater stability with @xcite finding 0.05 per cent flatfield stability over a period of one day for a 2048@xmath67 hawaii-1rg engineering array .",
    "current observational evidence for a planetary signal at  therefore remains inconclusive .",
    "initial attempts to search for extrasolar planetary spectra ( by the method of difference analysis where the spectrum of the host star seen during eclipse of the planet is subtracted from the spectrum of the combined star and planet , seen out of eclipse ) revealed null results .",
    "the analysis by @xcite failed to detect the predicted continuum ` bump ' at 2.1 - 2.2  at a level of log@xmath68 .",
    "@xcite did not detect the eclipse shape from 2.3  secondary eclipse observations of , but nevertheless the mean drop in flux ( based on two measurements ) of 0.115 @xmath69 0.139 per cent indicates a planet - star flux ratio of 0.0010 @xmath69 0.0009 . while this confirms model predictions for a planet - star flux ratio , @xcite note that the size of the uncertainty does not exclude the blackbody result .    while advances have been made in detecting spectral features in the mid - infrared 7.5 - 13.2  interval @xcite using spitzer space telescope observations",
    ", models would suggest that the higher contrast ratio in the nir will necessitate the kind of signal enhancement techniques used in this work .",
    "it is clear that there is still much to learn about the atmospheres of cegps .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have found that there is little evidence for the h@xmath21o opacities present in model spectra .",
    "@xcite however find evidence for silicate clouds in the spectrum of .",
    "the simulations we have carried out in this work make the assumption that the opacities in current models are correct , even if their strengths are not .",
    "if many species are omitted or are simply not present in reality , this could have significant impact on the detection method , either for better or worse .",
    "as with the @xcite search for the 2.1 - 2.2  bump , our models contain unreliable oh opacities and oscillator strengths and missing ch@xmath70 opacities which are seen in t dwarf spectra @xcite .",
    "this is clearly important when using methods which aim to detect the ` continuum ' shape , while we found (  [ section : simplanet ] ) that incorrect positioning of greater than 15 per cent of lines would affect our ability to make a clear detection .",
    "conversely , competing models could be used to obtain an optimal extraction of the absorption signature of a planetary spectrum . switching off model opacities for species which are known to have unreliable positions",
    "may be necessary to enable recovery of the planetary signal . in the case of a clear detection",
    ", it should then also be possible to distinguish between differing phase function models by monitoring the improvement in @xmath39  in our matched filter analysis .",
    "if the albedo spectrum is largely independent of wavelength in the regions where absorbing species do not play a significant role , including 2.2  ( see fig .",
    "8 of @xcite ) , we would expect a very small reflected light component in the nir , given the upper limits found in the optical .",
    "our data contain only 10 lines arising from the spectrum of itself , with a mean depth 2.7 times the mean depth of the 98 lines we expect to see in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "nevertheless , if the 10 lines are seen as a component reflected from possible clouds in the atmosphere of , we expect little gain in the signal if the upper albedo limit of 0.12 @xcite is taken into account .",
