    "shannon in his seminal paper @xcite derived the capacity per unit - time of the _ continuous - time additive white gaussian noise _ channel ( ctawgn ) under input power constraint .",
    "the capacity is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the bandwidth , and where @xmath5 ; @xmath6 denotes the input power and @xmath3 denotes the power spectral density of the white gaussian noise .",
    "he used the sampling theorem for the band - limited signals and the capacity formula @xmath7 for the discrete - time awgn ( dtawgn ) under the input power constraint @xmath6 and noise variance @xmath8 .",
    "a more rigorous proof was later given by slepian @xcite , who introduced the prolate spheroidal wave functions and proved the well - known @xmath9-result for the dimension of the signal space _ essentially _ time - limited to @xmath0 and _ essentially _ band - limited to @xmath1 . in brief , the result states that for moderately large _ signal - to - noise ratio _ ( snr ) , the capacity scales like @xmath10 , and the _ degree - of - freedom _ ( dof ) for sufficiently high snr is given by @xmath11 .",
    "although the power - constraint is suitable for theoretical analysis and signal design ( due to isometry of the underlying hilbert spaces ) , in many practical scenarios in communications systems the front end of the ctawgn channel is a power amplifier with a limited amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it is important to know how the capacity varies under the amplitude constraint .",
    "this requires studying the dof of band - limited signals in @xmath12 $ ] rather than @xmath13 $ ] .    for the discrete - time case ,",
    "the amplitude - limited variant of the problem was studied by smith @xcite , who also showed that the capacity achieving input distribution is discrete and has a finite support .",
    "the result was extended to the complex - valued gaussian channels in @xcite , and bounds on the capacity were derived in @xcite .",
    "recently , tighter bounds were obtained in @xcite via a dual capacity result stated in @xcite .",
    "an interesting lower - bound was given in @xcite by using a recent result of lyubarskii and vershynin @xcite on the existence of tight frames , which in turn uses a deep result of kashin on the comparison of diameter of certain subsets of banach spaces under different norms @xcite .",
    "in brief , the main idea in @xcite is to admit some rate loss to transform codewords designed for the power - limited dtawgn channel ( codewords with limited @xmath14-norm ) into codewords with limited amplitude ( limited @xmath15-norm ) suitable for amplitude - limited dtawgn .",
    "however , in contrast with the power - limited case , where the discrete - time and the continuous - time variants are related via hilbert space isometries , the results in @xcite does not directly extend to the continuous - time case due to the lack of obvious isometry between @xmath16 and @xmath12 $ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we study the continuous - time variant of the problem when the transmitter uses an orthonormal collection of waveforms @xmath17 , for signal modulation .",

    "we focus on the signal space of harmonic waveforms @xmath26 , known as _ orthogonal frequency division modulation _ ( ofdm ) .",
    "it has been vastly studied in the literature due to its simple implementation ( with fft algorithm ) , robustness to multi - path fading in wireless scattering channels , and its information theoretic optimality for water - filling type encoding under frequency - selective gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "coding for amplitude - limited ofdm channels is related to the well - known _ peak - to - average power ratio _",
    "( papr ) reduction problem . in brief , as the communication is over the awgn channel , the performance is an increasing function of the average transmit power .",
    "however , due to the amplitude limitation @xmath2 , the peak power is limited .",
    "therefore , the papr is a measure of the efficiency of the signal set ( code in the signal space ) , and its minimization corresponds to maximizing the average transmit power .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem such as coding , tone reservation , amplitude clipping , clipping and filtering , tone injection and partial transmit sequences .",
    "a summary of important results can be found in the survey papers @xcite .",
    "there is another collection of work on designing good codes with reasonable papr as in the papers @xcite ( see also @xcite and the refs . therein ) .",
    "while these codes reduce papr , they also reduce the transmission rate severely , especially for very large number of subcarriers .",
    "* contribution . * in this paper , we make a connection between the ofdm for traditional _ radio frequency _ ( rf ) channels and ofdm for optical intensity channels ( oc ) under the intensity constraint @xmath2 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we show that the encoding set for both cases has a _ semi - definite programming _ ( sdp ) representation , which we use to study the capacity scaling performance for both channels . in particular ,",
    "we show that even though ofdm achieves the optimal dof scaling @xmath11 for oc in high snr , it seems that , the best possible dof in moderate snr is at most @xmath27 , with a multiplicative loss @xmath28 .",
    "interestingly , this confirms a recent result of @xcite , where the authors using the results of lyubarskii and vershynin in @xcite , show ( and numerically verify ) that if the columns of a subsampled fourier matrix build a tight frame , then it is possible to make all codewords have a constant papr at the cost of a multiplicative rate loss due to those carriers reserved for shaping ( _ tone - reservation _",
    "we study this problem further , and provide additional evidence that the constant papr seems to be achievable , by formulating it as the statistical width of a specific convex set .",
    "our results suggest that , in ofdm systems with a large number of subcarriers , tr is a promising approach in order to achieve an effective papr reduction at the cost of a fixed multiplicative loss of dofs .",

    "this approach , known as tone reservation ( tr ) , has been widely investigated in the literature ( see refs . in section [ inro ] ) and will be treated in a novel way in section [ tr ] , by exploiting our sdp characterization of the set @xmath53 .      using the results in @xcite and upper bounds on the volume in derived in section [ vol_section ] , we obtain an upper bound on the capacity per unit time of oc in high - snr regime , which also gives an upper bound for the capacity of rf . after suitable",
    "scaling we have @xmath272 which shows that the lower bounds in is tight for oc up to a finite loss in snr .",
    "in this section , we investigate tone - reservation algorithm ( tr ) for an individual ofdm block of large dimension @xmath257 .",
    "of course , in practice , coding across a sufficiently large number of ofdm blocks can be used to further increase the reliability . from capacity result in",
    ", it seems that the loss in snr given by @xmath269 might scale as @xmath270 .",
    "thus , to compensate the loss in snr , it might be necessary to encode over blocks with smaller @xmath11 .",
    "for a fixed bandwidth @xmath1 , it implies that the ofdm packets should be made smaller , and coding over consecutive blocks should be used to achieve the optimal scaling @xmath273 .",
    "recently , ilic and strohmer @xcite studied the performance of tone reservation ( tr ) using the results of lyubarskii and vershynin in @xcite . although not yet rigorous , their results suggest that a constant papr for all codewords is possible provided that a fixed fraction of carriers are devoted to waveform shaping , and papr reduction .",
    "this shows that , the dof @xmath11 up to a multiplicative loss seems to be achievable . in this section , using the sdp representation for @xmath53 , we prove that the best papr for tr is given by the statistical width of an appropriate convex set that we define .    in tr an ofdm block of length @xmath18 is divided into two sub - blocks : a block @xmath274 $ ] of size @xmath275 , @xmath28 , containing the information symbols , and a block @xmath276\\backslash \\cli$ ] containing the symbols used for waveform shaping to reduce the papr .",

    "let @xmath278 be the sequence of information symbols .",
    "we assume that each component of @xmath279 is selected from a given signal constellation such as qam .",

    ", it was proved that if a fraction of subcarriers is reserved to reduce the papr so that the constant papr criterion is always met by _ all _ the transmitted waveforms , then the fraction of the remaining subcarriers that can be allocated to the information symbols tends to zero .",
    "our numerical results , however , indicate that this seems to be a worst case measure , and in fact the capacity seems to be nonzero .",
