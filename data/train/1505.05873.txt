    "for several decades we have tried to give birth to a well constructed quantum gravity theory that can reconcile with the general theory of relativity . with the discovery of the late cosmic acceleration @xcite at the turn of the last century ,",
    "the unified theory became all the more necessary .",
    "several footsteps can be found in literature that aims at producing a uv complete theory .",
    "motivated by the success of the theory proposed by lifshitz @xcite in solid state physics , horava proposed a gravity theory widely known the horava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite . taking the uv limit into account , hl gravity has a lifshitz like anisotropic scaling as @xmath11 and @xmath12 between space and time .",
    "as this is characterized by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath13 , it breaks the lorentz invariance , while in the infra red limit , the scale reduces to @xmath14 , i.e. , it is reduced to classical general relativistic theory of gravity in the low energy limit . even if we add a @xmath15 term , ` @xmath16 ' being the scale factor , with the friedmann equation @xcite we will have hl gravity equations .    in the original proposal ,",
    "horava @xcite considered projectability condition with / without the detailed balance .",
    "the detailed balance condition was originally proposed in order to reduce the number of operations in the action ( i.e. , number of independent coupling constants ) and to simplify some properties of the quantum system . as a result the form of potential in the 4-dimensional lorentzian action",
    "is restricted to a specific form in terms of a 3d euclidean theory .",
    "but from cosmological point of view , this condition leads to major obstacles and hence should be abandoned .    on the other hand ,",
    "the fundamental symmetry of the theory namely the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism invariance leads to the projectability condition .",
    "in particular , one should have 3d spatial diffeomorphism and the space - independent time reparametrization . as the lapse function is essentially the gauge degree of freedom associated with the time reparametrization ,",
    "so it should be independent of space coordinates .",
    "this is termed as projectibility condition . due to this projectibility condition ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is not a local equation satisfied at each spatial point but an equation integrable over a whole space , i.e. , a global hamiltonian constraint .",
    "note that absence of projectability condition and imposing a local version of the hamiltonian constraint lead to phenomenological obstacles and theoretical inconsistencies .    however , the important drawback of projectibility condition is that : due to the global hamiltonian constraint the general relativity could not be recovered from the horava gravity for arbitrary small lambda .",
    "also the projectibility condition from the point of view of condensed matter physics may not be appropriate for describing the ( quantum ) gravity .",
    "in extragalactic astronomy , type ia supernovae have a characteristic light curve .",
    "the similarity in absolute luminosity profiles of nearly all known type ia supernovae helps astrophysicists to treat them as a standard candle . using this fact the observations riess et al and perlmutter et al in 1998 @xcite led us to the conclusion that our universe is going through a cosmic acceleration .",
    "there are two popular ways that provide theoretical support to the present day accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "one is to modify the geometric part of einstein equation , leading to the ideas of modified gravity and the other is to consider the universe to be filled up uniformly by some exotic matter possessing negative pressure .",
    "the friedmann equation @xmath17 requires the condition @xmath18 for accelerated expansion ( @xmath19 ) . as density",
    "is an ever positive physical quantity , we see the equation of state ( eos ) parameter must be negative and also less than @xmath20 . such a negative pressure creating substance is aptly termed as dark energy ( de here after ) .",
    "recent observational data indicates that de occupies @xmath21 of the whole matter - energy of our universe .",
    "theoretically we can find many proposed de candidates .",
    "variable modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg ) is one among them .",
    "the equation of state of vmcg is given as @xcite @xmath22 here we consider @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath6 are constants .    in 1904",
    ", chaplygin @xcite introduced chaplygin gas ( cg ) , whose eos is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a positive constant .",
    "an attractive feature of the model is that it behaves as dust - like matter at an early stage and as cosmological constant at later stages i.e. the cg behaves like a pressure less fluid for small values of scale factor and as a cosmological constant for large values of scale factors which tend to accelerate the expansion . at the beginning of this century , the cg model went through a series of modifications , all in the quest of a suitable candidate for de .    in @xcite , bento et al for the first time gave the idea of generalised cg having the eos @xmath27 whereas in 2010 , jamil @xcite presented a model in which the new generalized chaplygin gas interacts with matter .",
    "benaoum in 2002 further modified cg model and proposed the modified cg ( mcg ) model obeying the equation of state @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 , this eos shows radiation era at one extreme ( when the scale factor is vanishingly small ) while @xmath32cdm model at the other extreme ( when the scale factor is infinitely large ) . at all stages",
    "it shows a mixture . amidst these there",
    "also exist one stage when the pressure vanishes and the matter content is equivalent to pure dust . on further modification vmcg came into existence . in @xcite ,",
    "jamil investigated the evolution of a schwarzschild black hole in the standard model of cosmology using the phantom - like modified variable chaplygin gas and the viscous generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "present day trend of literature says that the combination of de with modified gravity together gives more interesting results . in 2010",
    "park showed in @xcite that the friedmann equation in horava gravity contains additional @xmath33 , @xmath34 and cosmological constant terms as the effective de and he predicted that these terms may be responsible for cosmic acceleration .",
    "these terms , coined as horava effective de , were tried to be constrained on a few occasions @xcite .",
    "the best ever approach was via phenomenological parametrization of the relevant physical quantities that have been well - studied .",
    "park himself considered the widely used cpl parametrization .",
    "b. c. paul and his coleagues have studied constraints for different exotic fluid model in the back ground of hl gravity @xcite . in this work , we shall study the limits of the de parameters constrained by different data sets .",
    "first we will set the constraint for the closed universe and analyze it .",
    "later on we deal with the range of parameters for open and flat universe .",
    "it is quite understood that any observational constraints on hl gravity do not enlighten the discussion about the well - known conceptual problems and instabilities of the theory , nor it can address the questions concerning its validity . therefore in the present analysis",
    "the hl gravity has to be considered as a phenomenological model .",
    "the same holds for the chaplygin gas model as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the basic generalized equations for hl gravity are given in section ( 2 ) .",
    "various dimensionless density parameters have been discussed in section ( 3 ) . the main mechanisms which will be followed to analyze the data",
    "is briefly given in section ( 4 ) .",
    "lastly , a brief summary and a fruitful conclusion have been drawn in section ( 5 ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the arnowitt - deser - misner decomposition of the metric which is given by @xcite @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the lapse function , @xmath37 is the shift vector , @xmath38 is the spatial metric .",
    "the scaling transformation of the coordinates reads as : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the hl gravity action has two constituents , namely , the kinetic and the potential term as @xmath41 where , the kinetic term is given by @xmath42\\ ] ] where , the extrinsic curvature is given as @xmath43 the number of invariants , while working with the lagrangian , @xmath44 , can be reduced due to its symmetric property @xcite .",
    "this symmetry actually is known as detailed balance . considering this detailed balance",
    "the expanded form of the action becomes @xmath45\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the cotton tensor and all the covariant derivatives are determined with respect to the spatial metric .",
    "@xmath47 is a totally antisymmetric unit tensor , @xmath48 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants .    now to set the matter - tensor the total energy density and pressure ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively will be taken which will contain in itself the impact of the baryonic density ( @xmath54 ) , dark matter density ( @xmath55 ) , etc .    assuming only temporal dependency of the lapse function ( i.e. , @xmath56 )",
    ", horava obtained a gravitational action .",
    "using frw metric with @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 represent open , closed and flat universe respectively and taking variation of @xmath36 and @xmath38 we obtain the friedmann equations @xcite @xmath60-\\frac{\\kappa^4",
