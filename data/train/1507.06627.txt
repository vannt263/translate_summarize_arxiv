    "vega - type stars are main - sequence ( ms ) stars with infrared ( ir ) emission in excess of the stellar photospheric radiation ( see backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "this `` excess '' emission is attributed to the thermal emission of solid dust grains in a `` debris '' disk , an optically thin disk orbiting around the central star . in debris disks , the gas is tenuous , and dust grains are removed easily by radiation pressure ( rp ) and the poynting ",
    "roberson drag ( burns et al .",
    "1979 , backman & paresce 1993 ) . to sustain a debris disk ,",
    "dust grains need to be replenished continuously by collisions between planetesimals , asteroids , and comets .",
    "this implies that grains in a debris disk are not the primordial materials left over from the protostellar molecular cloud but remnants of the planet formation process .",
    "hd34700 , also known as sao112630 , is classified as a vega - like star based on its ir excess ( e.g. , see walker & wolstencroft 1988 ) .",
    "it has a spectral type of g0ive , an effective temperature of @xmath1 ( see schtz et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) , and a total stellar luminosity of @xmath2 ( acke & van den ancker 2004 ) . with a hipparcos parallax of @xmath3mas ,",
    "its distance @xmath4 is very uncertain , which makes the estimate of its age , mass , and size ambiguous .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath4 is at least @xmath5100@xmath6 ( torres 2004 ) , and its apparent proximity to orion provides an upper limit of @xmath7 . assuming @xmath8 , torres ( 2004 ) estimated the stellar mass to be @xmath9@xmath101.11.2 @xmath11 .",
    "the hd34700 system is known as a multiple system consisting of a spectroscopic binary ( torres 2004 ) and two other faint stellar components which are at a separation of @xmath552 and @xmath592 , respectively , for component b and component c ( sterzik et al .",
    "while the two faint components are classified as bonafide t tauri stars ( tts ) based on their strong h@xmath12 emission and @xmath13 absorption , the nature of the spectroscopic binary is somewhat vague .",
    "both the h@xmath12 emission and the @xmath13 absorption ( with an equivalent width of @xmath50.6 and @xmath50.17@xmath14 , respectively ) detected in hd34700 are relatively weak ( arellano ferro & giridhar 2003 , sterzik et al .",
    "2005 ) , indicating that the age of hd34700 can not be a few mega - years but a few tens of mega - years ( torres 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , as we will show later in section  [ sec : discussion ] that the lifetime of the dust grains in the disk around hd34700 is shorter than the stellar age , therefore it is plausible that hd34700 has a debris disk rather than a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the hd34700 debris disk has been extensively studied observationally , including space - borne and ground - based broadband photometry of the ir `` excess '' emission from the near - ir to submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "of particular interest is the detection of the prominent 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath0 emission bands in hd34700 .",
    "these emission features are collectively known as the `` unidentified infrared '' ( uir ) emission bands ( see tielens 2008 , peeters 2014 , joblin 2015 ) and are now generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola et al . 1985 ) .",
    "they are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of galactic and extragalactic regions , including protoplanetary disks around herbig ae / be stars and tts and disks in transition from a primordial to debris phase ( e.g. , see brooke et al .",

    "the astro - pah model of li & draine ( 2001 ) and draine & li ( 2007 ) represents the absorption cross section of each pah feature by a drude profile , which is expected for classical damped harmonic oscillators ( see li 2009a ) .",

    "the pah features shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] manifest that both neutral and ionized pahs exist in the hd34700 disk because ionized pahs emit strongly at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6@xmath0 , in contrast , neutral pahs emit strongly at 3.3 and 11.3@xmath0 .",

    "moreover , the pah size also affects its charging . following the approaches described in li & lunine ( 2003a ) , we calculate the photoionization rate ( @xmath47 ) and the electron recombination rate ( @xmath48 ) for pahs of a given size at a given distance ( @xmath49 ) from the central star ( see appendices a and b in li & lunine 2003a ) .    to calculate @xmath48",

    "note that @xmath66 is considered to be the cutoff distance of the pah distribution in the hd34700 disk since at @xmath67 the dust temperatures drop to @xmath68 ( see section [ sec : results ] ) , so the dust willx acquire an ice mantle and pahs will condense onto the ice mantle . as discussed in li & lunine ( 2003a ) , @xmath69 decreases for larger pahs since the ionization threshold is inversely proportional to the pah size .",
    "also , @xmath69 decreases as pahs get closer to the central star .",

    "overall , @xmath75 decreases as the distance @xmath49 increases , consistent with the variation trend of @xmath44 with @xmath49 ( see figure [ fig : ne](d ) ) which determines the charging of pahs as a function of @xmath49 . roughly speaking ,",
    "pahs near the central star are fully ionized since @xmath78 even for the smallest pahs . at @xmath51525@xmath65 , however , because of @xmath79 for pahs of @xmath80 ( see figure  [ fig : ion](a ) ) , a fraction of them will be negatively charged , so @xmath75 will be nonzero even for the smallest pahs at @xmath66 ( see figure  [ fig : ion](b ) ) . therefore , we expect a mixture of neutral and charged pahs ( cations or anions ) in the hd34700 disk .",

    "the porous grain model of li & lunine ( 2003a ) for protoplanetary and debris disks assumes that the dust consists of porous aggregates of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials , and the dust in regions cooler than @xmath5120@xmath81 is further coated with h@xmath50o - dominated ices .",
    "we take the dielectric functions of `` astronomical '' silicate of draine & lee ( 1984 ) for the silicate component , amorphous carbon of rouleau & martin ( 1991 ) for the carbonaceous component , and `` dirty '' ice of li & greenberg ( 1998 ) for the ice component . assuming a spherical shape , the absorption cross sections of porous dust are calculated from mie theory combined with the maxwell  garnett and bruggeman effective medium theories ( see li 2009a ) .",
    "we adopt the mass mixing ratios of li & lunine ( 2003b ) derived from cosmic abundance considerations .",
    "we first employ the maxwell - garnett effective medium theory to calculate the average dielectric functions for the ice - coated silicate subgrains and the ice - coated carbonaceous subgrains ( see equations  ( 7),(8 ) of li & lunine 2003a ) and then use the bruggman effective medium theory to calculate the average dielectric functions for the porous dust aggregate ( equation  ( 9 ) of li & lunine 2003a ) .",
    "the porosity ( or fluffiness ) of a grain is quantified by the fractional volume of vacuum ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "we propose a more physical formula for the spatial distribution , which is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the inner boundary of the disk , which is set to be the distance where the dust temperature reaches @xmath51500@xmath81 and dust sublimates .",
    "this functional form has the advantage that on one hand , it resembles a power - law @xmath93 at larger distances ( @xmath94 ) , and on the other hand it peaks at @xmath95 , unlike the simple power - law which peaks at @xmath96 .",
    "the latter is unphysical as it assumes that the dust piles up at @xmath96 where dust actually sublimates .",

    "this is caused by the ice sublimation at @xmath128 : porous dust larger than @xmath86@xmath530@xmath0 attains @xmath128 at @xmath129 .",
    "when the silicate and carbonaceous subgrains acquire an ice mantle at @xmath68 , their aggregates will be less absorptive and therefore attain a lower equilibrium temperature .    the location where dust grains have low enough temperatures to capture volatile molecules to form ice mantles",
    "is called the `` snowline . ''",
    "the snowline plays an important role in the pah chemistry since free - flying pahs will condense onto the ice mantles .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : teq](a ) , the transition from non - icy grains to icy grains occurs at different distances from the star for grains of different sizes : for smaller grains , the `` snowline '' is further away from the star , and by @xmath130 all grains become ice - coated . for simplicity , in the following ,",
    "we adopt @xmath66 as the snowline of the hd34700 disk .",
    "although the observed sed is closely reproduced by our best - fit model , there could exist some flexibilities for the model parameters .",
    "we briefly describe here the robustness of our model and refer to li & lunine ( 2003a ) , who explicitly discussed all the parameters of the porous dust model for disks ( see their section 4.1 for details ) .",
    "first , we examine the adopted dust parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath82 while other parameters remain unchanged",
    ". we differ @xmath89 between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "while models with a large @xmath89 ( @xmath510@xmath0 ) emit too little in the mid - ir at @xmath133 , those with a small @xmath89 ( @xmath50.1@xmath0 ) deviate the fit at the mid- and far - ir .",
    "similarly , by varying @xmath90 from @xmath134 up to @xmath135 , we find that sufficiently large grains ( @xmath136 ) are necessary for reproducing the observed submm emission .",
    "the models with @xmath137 produce almost identical seds .",
    "as @xmath90 decreases , the total dust mass ( @xmath138 ) decreases by a factor of @xmath53 at most .",
    "the porosity @xmath82 is degenerate with @xmath139 and @xmath96 since decreasing @xmath139 or @xmath92 or increasing @xmath82 has the same effect of increasing the dust temperature .",
    "however , a porosity in the range of @xmath140 is expected for dust aggregates formed through coagulation as demonstrated both theoretically ( cameron & schneck 1965 ) and experimentally ( blum & wurm 2008 ) . moreover ,",
    "a porosity of @xmath141 is consistent with the mean mass density of cometary nuclei for which the ice - coated dust aggregates are plausible building blocks ( see greenberg & li 1999 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the fluxes calculated from models with @xmath142 for the hd34700 disk agree with each other within @xmath143 .",
    "we also examine the dust spatial distribution parameters @xmath117 and @xmath101 which are not readily constrained due to the lack of spatial resolution of the disk .",
    "we find that models with small @xmath117 ( @xmath144 ) would emit too much around @xmath145 due to the silicate emission feature , while models with large @xmath117 ( @xmath146 ) fail to explain the far - ir / submm emission .",
    "the @xmath147 models produce reasonable fits , with @xmath138 varying by a factor of @xmath52 at most .",
    "we also find that varying @xmath101 ( @xmath148 ; combined with @xmath117 ) does not affect the model - fit significantly . in summary , although different combinations of model parameters may be able to explain the observed sed , the underlyling results do not change .",
    "the estimate of @xmath138 is most vulnerable ( by a factor of @xmath53 at most ) , while the other estimates ( e.g. , @xmath149 and @xmath150 in section  [ sec : rppr ] ) vary within @xmath520% .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : results ] , due to the single - photon heating nature of pahs , the total mass of pahs in the disk ( @xmath151 ) required to reproduce the observed pah emission is simply scaled by @xmath16 , the starlight intensity .",
    "however , we can not constrain @xmath16 ( which is inverse proportional to @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath152 ) since the hd 34700 disk has not been spatially resolved and hence we do not have any prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of pahs .",
    "one may derive @xmath153 by locating all pahs at @xmath66 , corresponding to an angular size of @xmath154 at a distance of @xmath155 .",

    "even with @xmath153 for @xmath66 , the pah - to - dust mass ratio is only @xmath156 , , see section [ sec : results ] ) emitted by pahs is much higher than the pah - to - dust mass ratio .",

    "the deficit of pahs relative to dust has previously been reported for debris disks ( e.g. , see li & lunine 2003a , thi et al .",
    "however , the derived pah - to - dust mass ratio may not reflect the actual pah - to - dust mass ratio in the hd34700 disk as there could be a substantial amount of pahs in the disk beyond the snowline .",
    "the minor features at 3.43 , 6.89 , and 7.23@xmath0 shown in the hd34700 disk reveal that the pah molecules very likely have aliphatic sidegroups , although the 3.43@xmath0 feature could also be due to anharmonicity and/or superhydrogenation of the aromatic c  h stretch ( barker et al .",
    "1987 , bernstein et al .",

    "2013 ) calculated @xmath163 . by assuming that the 3.43@xmath0 emission is exclusively due to aliphatic c  h ( i.e. , neglecting anharmonicity and superhydrogenation ) , we can place an upper limit on the ratio of the number of c atoms in aliphatic sidegroups to that in aromatic benzene rings : @xmath164 .",
    "it is assumed here that one aliphatic c atom corresponds to 2.5 aliphatic c  h bonds and one aromatic c atom corresponds to 0.75 aromatic c  h bond ( see li & draine 2012 ) .",
    "similarly , we can place an upper limit of @xmath165 from the ratio of the observed intensity of the 6.89@xmath0 feature to that of the 7.7@xmath0 feature ( @xmath166 ; see section 3 of li & draine 2012 for details ) .",
    "it is not clear why pahs are rarely seen in debris disks .",
    "this may be related to the disk structure and the stellar age .",
    "there exists evidence that most of the protoplanetary disks in which the pah emission features have been detected have a flaring disk geometry ( meeus et al .",
    "2001 , acke & van den ancker 2004 ) .",
    "a common interpretation for this is that flared disks intercept more stellar radiation than flat ones , especially at large distances from the central star ; the pah emission originates in the surface layers of a flared disk , where pahs are directly exposed to starlight ( chiang & goldreich 1997 , meeus et al .  2001 , acke & van den ancker 2004 , habart , natta , & krgel 2004 ) .",
    "it is not clear if this scenario applies to the hd34700 disk as it is not spatially resolved .",
    "if the pahs seen in debris disks originate from the outgassing of cometary bodies ( i.e. , the sublimation of the icy mantles coated on cometary grains onto which pahs have condensed during the protostellar dense cloud phase , see li & lunine 2003a ) , it is more likely to see pahs in relatively young debris disks as they are subject to massive bombardment by cometary bodies ( chyba et al .",
    "1994 ) . with an age of a few tens of mega - years ( torres 2004 ) ,",
    "the hd34700 disk is probably still in the heavy bombardment phase as it lasted more than 500 mega - years in our early solar system ( chyba et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "a pah molecule is subjected to photodissociation upon absorbing an energetic photon . during this process ,",
    "pahs , preferentially small pahs , might lose a hydrogen atom , a hydrogen molecule , or an acetylene molecule ( c@xmath50h@xmath50 ) , which eventually results in the destruction of a pah molecule .",
    "following li & lunine ( 2003a ) , we have calculated the photodestruction rates ( @xmath167 ) for the pahs in the hd34700 disk assuming that a pah molecule is destroyed through the c@xmath50h@xmath50 ejection .",
    "figure  [ fig : kdes ] shows the photodestruction timescales ( @xmath168 ) at given distances ( @xmath64 , 15 , and 25au ) . during the lifetime of hd34700 ( @xmath53 ) , pahs with a size of @xmath169 ( corresponding to pahs with @xmath170 carbon atoms ) are likely to be photodestroyed . against the complete removal of such small pahs in the hd34700 disk , these pahs have to be replenished continuously , which is indeed required to account for the observed pah emission . assuming the pahs in the hd34700 disk follow the same spatial distribution as porous dust ( see equation([eq : dndr ] ) ) but with a cutoff at @xmath66",
    ", we estimate the pah mass replenishment rate to be @xmath171 taking only photodestruction into account ( see also section [ sec : rppr ] ) .",
    "small dust in a debris disk is continuously expelled outward due to the rp against the gravitational force ( backman & paresce 1993 ) . following the approach described in section 4.3 of li & lunine ( 2003a ) , we derive the ratio of the radiative force to the gravitational force ( @xmath172 ) as a function of grain size.both the rp and the gravitational force are inversely proportional to @xmath110 , as a result , @xmath172 is independent of the distance from the central star .",
    "we find that grains smaller than @xmath52040@xmath0 have @xmath173 ( see figure  [ fig : rppr ] ) .",
    "this indicates that grains with a radius smaller than @xmath540@xmath0 ( @xmath520@xmath0 for icy grains ) will be blown out due to rp .",
    "moreover , assuming that the gas drag is not overwhelming which is true for debris disks , even larger grains ( @xmath54080@xmath0 ) could be pushed outward ( see figure  [ fig : rppr ] ) because dust particles released from parent bodies at periastron only need @xmath174 for ejection ( burns et al .",
    "1979 ) .    unlike dust grains , the @xmath172 ratio for pahs is not sensitive to their sizes as they are in the rayleigh limit ( see li 2009a ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath175 for the pahs in the hd34700 disk .",
    "dust grains can migrate inward due to the poynting ",
    "roberson ( pr ) drag ( backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "we calculate the pr drag timescale ( @xmath176 ) , which is a function of grain size and the distance ( @xmath49 ) from the star .",
    "note that , unlike the rp ejection , the pr drag is proportional to @xmath110 .    at the peak distance of @xmath116 ,",
    "grains smaller than @xmath550100@xmath0 have a pr lifetime shorter than the age of hd34700 ( assuming @xmath53 ; see figure  [ fig : rppr ] ) .",
    "the closer dust grains are located to the star , the bigger grains will be gradually accreted to the central star . for pahs",
    ", we estimate @xmath177 for pahs at @xmath66 , which is independent of their sizes for the same reason as for @xmath172 .",
    "taking into account the rp ejection , the pr drag , as well as the photodissociation of pahs , we examine the removal of dust and pahs in the hd34700 disk as a function of their sizes and distance from the star .",
    "the rp timescale in the hd34700 disk is estimated to be @xmath178 assuming that it is comparable to the local dynamical timescale @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the keplerian frequency . for grains with @xmath181 ( i.e. , @xmath182 )",
    ", the rp timescale at a given distance is much smaller than the pr drag timescale ( see figure [ fig : rppr ] ) .",
    "therefore , for these grains the rp expulsion is the dominant removal process over the entire disk . for larger grains (",
    "i.e. , @xmath183 ) , if the pr timescale @xmath184 is shorter than the stellar age @xmath185 , the pr drag becomes an effective removal mechanism . at @xmath186 ,",
    "this applies to grains of @xmath187 ( see figure  [ fig : rppr ] ) .",
    "for grains at a larger distance from the star , the size range over which the pr drag is effective becomes narrower , and eventually , the pr drag no longer contributes to the dust removal beyond @xmath188 .",
    "since the overall dust removal in the hd34700 disk is dominated by the rp ejection , we calculate the rp dust mass - loss rate for our best - fit model .",
    "following equation ( 20 ) in li & lunine ( 2003a ) , we derive @xmath189 .",
    "hence , @xmath52000@xmath123 of dust has been removed during the lifetime of hd34700 . for comparison ,",
    "the pr dust mass - loss rate integrated over the dust size distribution and over the entire disk is estimated to be @xmath190 .    in the same manner as for dust grains , we estimate the pah mass loss rate due to the rp expulsion to be @xmath191 .",
    "note that pahs are also subject to photodissociation ( see section [ sec : dest ] ) .",
    "we found that the rp timescale is much shorter than the photodestruction timescale except for the smallest pahs ( @xmath86@xmath103.53.6@xmath14 ) .",
    "the pah mass loss rate via the rp expulsion ( @xmath149 ) yields that @xmath530@xmath123 of pah molecules have been removed from the disk or have been replenished to maintain the current pah abundance during the 10myr lifetime of hd34700 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pah - to - dust mass - loss ratio , @xmath192 , is about three order of magnitudes higher than the pah - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath193 ( see section  [ sec : pah ] ) .",
    "this is because only grains with @xmath182 will be ejected by the rp expulsion ( see figure [ fig : rppr ] ) and with a best - fit dust size distribution of @xmath194 ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) , the total dust mass in the hd34700 disk is dominated by much larger grains .",
    "thus , only a small mass fraction of the dust is subject to the rp expulsion , whereas pahs of all sizes have been removed or replenished .",
    "the high removal rates of small dust and pahs derived above require an efficient replenishment probably provided by the outgassing and collisions of planetesimals , asteroidal , and cometary bodies to contain a stable amount of small grains and pahs in the disk ( backman & paresce 1993 , wyatt 2008 , kiefer et al .",
    "in particular , as pahs have been detected in interplanetary dust particles , comets , and meteorites ( e.g. , see li 2009b for overview ) , cometary origin of pahs in the hd34700 disk is plausible . by systematically studying all debris disks with detected pah features , we will ( hopefully ) be able to constrain the origin of pahs and dust in debris disks ( j. y.  seok & a.  li , 2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "the hd34700 disk is one of the few debris disks that show prominent pah emission in their ir spectra .",
    "we have modeled the pah emission of the hd34700 disk as well as its entire sed from the near - ir up to submm / mm wavelength regime .",
    "the stellar rp and poynting  robertson drag quickly remove the dust and pahs in the hd34700 disk , implying that they must have been replenished continuously to maintain their current abundances .    the major pah features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath0 ( as well as the minor features at 3.43 , 6.89 , and 7.23@xmath0 ) are present in the ir spectra , indicating the presence of a mixture of neutral and ionized pahs ( with aliphatic sidegroups ) in the disk .",
    "by comparing the photoionization and electron recombination timescales , it is found that the pahs in the inner disk are likely to be ionized while those in the outer disk are to be neutral or negatively charged . also ,",
    "at a given distance from the star , smaller pahs are more likely to be neutral whereas larger pahs are more likely to be charged .",
    "hence , one would expect a mixture of neutral and ionized pahs in the hd34700 disk . adopting a log - normal size distribution for the pahs ,",
    "the hd34700 disk is in favor of smaller pahs ( @xmath195 and @xmath196 ) compared to that of the diffuse ism .",
    "this is supported by the the prominent 3.3@xmath0 pah feature , which is indicative of small , neutral pahs .",
    "the 3.43@xmath0 feature commonly attributed to aliphatic c ",
    "h stretch allows us to place an upper limit of @xmath50.22 on the ratio of c atoms in aliphatic sidegroups to that in aromatic benzene rings .",
    "the 6.89@xmath0 feature , an aliphatic c  h deformation band , derives the ratio of aliphatic c atoms to aromatic c atoms to be @xmath50.14 .",
    "the total ir luminosity of @xmath197 is derived with a distance of @xmath198 pc .",
    "this leads to @xmath199 , and the pah emission accounts for @xmath510% of the total @xmath200 .",
    "our best fit model suggests that the dust spatial distribution peaks at @xmath201 and decreases outward with a power - law index of @xmath105 .",
    "taking the disk geometry into account , the total dust mass in the disk is estimated to be @xmath103 .",
    "porous grains larger than @xmath530@xmath0 attain an equilibrium temperature of @xmath202120@xmath81 at @xmath129 , indicating that ice mantles on these grains begin to develop at @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 is regarded as the `` snowline '' in the hd34700 disk .    without any prior knowledge of the pah spatial distribution ,",
    "the observed pah emission yields a total mass of @xmath203 if one assumes that all the pahs are at a distance of @xmath49 from the central star . as free - flying pahs",

    "this results in a pah - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath156 , indicating a deficiency of pahs in debris disks compared with the diffuse ism .",
    "the photodissociation of pah molecules occurs continuously by absorbing an energetic photon , and small pahs ( @xmath169 ) are likely to have been photo - destroyed during the lifetime of hd34700 ( @xmath53 ) .",

    "<S> the debris disk around the vega - type star hd34700 is detected in dust thermal emission from the near infrared ( ir ) to millimeter ( mm ) and submm wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> also detected is a distinct set of emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath0 , which are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we model the observed dust ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and pah emission features of the hd34700 disk in terms of porous dust and astronomical - pahs . </S>",
    "<S> porous dust together with a mixture of neutral and ionized pahs closely explains the dust ir sed and pah emission features observed in the hd34700 disk . due to the stellar radiation pressure and poynting  </S>",
    "<S> robertson drag together with the photodissociation of pahs , substantial removal of dust and pahs has occurred in the disk , and continuous replenishment of these materials is required to maintain their current abundances . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that these materials are not primitive but secondary products probably originating from mutual collisions among planetesimals , asteroids , and comets . </S>"
