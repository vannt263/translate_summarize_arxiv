    "many studies exist for the numerical solutions of the differential equations using splines .",
    "splines are piecewise functions which have certain continuity at the joint points given to set up the splines .",
    "the spline related numerical techniques mainly offer the economical computer code and easy computational calculations .",

    "the polynomial spline based algorithms have been found to be quite advantageous for finding solutions of the differential equations . because it has been demonstrated that they yield the lower cost and simplicity to write the program code .",
    "base of splines known as the b - splines is also widely used to build up the trial functions for numerical methods .",
    "the exponential spline is proposed to be more general form of these splines . in the approximation theory ,",
    "the exponential b - splines are shown to model the data which have  sudden growth and decaywhereas polynomials are not appropriate due to having osculatory behavior . since some differential equations have steep solutions , the use of the exponential b - splines in the numerical methods may exhibit good solutions for differential equations .",
    "mccartin @xcite has introduced the exponential b - spline as a basis for the space of exponential splines . the exponential b - spline properties accord with those of polynomial b - splines such as smootness , compact support , positivity , recursion for derivatives .",
    "thus the exponential b - splines can be used as the trial function for the variational methods such as galerkin and collocation methods .",
    "the exponential b - spline based methods have been started to solve some differential equations : numerical solution of the singular perturbation problem is solved with a variant of exponential b - spline collocation method in the work @xcite , the cardinal exponential b - splines is used for solving the singularly perturbed problems @xcite , the exponential b - spline collocation method is built up for finding the numerical solutions of the self - adjoint singularly perturbed boundary value problems in the work @xcite , the numerical solutions of the convection - diffusion equation is obtained by using the exponential b - spline collocation method mohammadi .    the collocation methods based on the exponential b - spline functions have been constructed to solve the differential equations . in this study , the exponential b - spline function",

    "thus nonlinear rlw equation will be solved with the proposed method numerically .",
    "the rlw equation describes a large number of important physical phenomena , such as shallow waters and plasma waves .",
    "therefore it plays a major role in the study of nonlinear dispersive waves . because of having limited analytical solutions , numerical analysis of the rlw equation has an importance in its study .",
