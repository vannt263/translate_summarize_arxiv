    "<S> recent data on particles associated with  trigger suggest that such events have jet structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , the exponential  of  suggests that no jets are involved . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve this puzzle by suggesting that the  is produced by the recombination of the enhanced thermal partons in the ridge that can have other hadrons in association with the trigger , all having exponential  s.    at the plenary sessions of this meeting it was shown twice that the star data on @xmath0 production at @xmath1 gev / c have associated particles above background for @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more details were given by bielcikova @xcite showing a peak in @xmath3 that falsifies the prediction that  trigger at high  should not be accompanied by associated particles on the near or far sides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data created a puzzle that needed to be addressed urgently . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the solution of that puzzle , instead of the original material prepared for the talk whose title appeared in the program . </S>",
    "<S> the replaced subjects are on the large @xmath4 ratios in particles produced ( a ) at intermediate  in the forward region at rhic @xcite , and ( b ) in the interval @xmath5 gev / c in the mid - rapidity region at lhc @xcite . in both of those regions </S>",
    "<S> no above background are expected . </S>",
    "<S> readers are referred to @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our attention here to the  puzzle only .    in @xcite on the strange - particle production at intermediate </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that @xmath6 quark shower parton is suppressed , and that  produced in the range @xmath7 gev / c at @xmath8 gev in central au+au collisions can be understood as the result of the recombination of three thermal partons with no involvement of shower partons . </S>",
    "<S> it is then predicted that there would be no particles with  above background . </S>",
    "<S> the recent data on the -triggered events @xcite prove that the prediction is wrong , although the assertion of the absence of shower partons in  is unchallenged . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have two seemingly contradictory phenomena that form the puzzle : ( 1 ) the  spectrum is exponential up to @xmath9 gev / c , and ( 2 ) the -triggered events in the range @xmath1 gev / c have associated hadrons in the range @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the two phenomena are depicted by the two panels in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . it is the aim of this talk to offer a solution to this puzzle .    </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these two phenomena are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> item ( 1 ) means that there is no contribution from hard scattering , which has the characteristic that it behaves in  as a power law . without that </S>",
    "<S> , there is no jet . </S>",
    "<S> however , item ( 2 ) means that there is jet structure . </S>",
    "<S> so is there or is there not a jet ? </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the puzzle resides in the recognition of _ phantom jet_.    before going any further , it is helpful to review first jet phenomenology , as discussed by calderon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the jet structure on the near side has a peak and a ridge . </S>",
    "<S> they are both visible when projected on @xmath10 , since the ridge is a flat pedestal on top of which sits the peak . when projected on @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> the ridge is not distinguishable from the peak because the ridge has a limited range in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the properties of these projections have been discussed in the recombination model in @xcite , to which we shall return below . </S>",
    "<S> how the peak and ridge depend on @xmath12 ,  and  was shown by putschke @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> star has chosen to refer to the peak as  jet \" , which can be misleading , since the ridge is also a part of the jet in the more inclusive sense . despite possible confusion we shall adhere to the nomenclature used in the experimental presentations where the peak was referred to as  jet \" ( with capital j ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of the jet structure analysis on unidentified with @xmath13 gev / c and @xmath14 gev / c is that the yield of jet+ridge(@xmath11 ) increases with @xmath12 , while that for jet(@xmath11 ) or jet(@xmath10 ) is essentially independent of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> that is a very striking result , since we know that the @xmath4 ratio at those  values depends on centrality , increasing from @xmath15 in @xmath16 collision to @xmath17 in central au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 yield being about 3 times the @xmath19 yield at 0 - 10% centrality suggests that the ridge @xmath20 not only is high in yield but also contributes significantly to the @xmath4 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> putschke further showed that at 0 - 10% centrality the behavior of the @xmath19 yield in  depends on  but that of the @xmath20 yield in  does not @xcite . for @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> gev / c and @xmath22 gev / c , it is found that @xmath23 .    pushing  to lower values </S>",
    "<S> , bielcikova showed that the @xmath24 ratio becomes as low as 0.1 - 0.15 at @xmath251.2 gev / c for unidentified hadrons , and that it is even lower @xmath26 for @xmath27-triggered events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that for -triggered events the @xmath24 ratio would be even smaller , perhaps @xmath28 , in which case the peak would be hardly visible in the @xmath10 projection . that is the scenario for which the notion of phantom jet is appropriate in referring to a @xmath10  that has essentially only a ridge . </S>",
    "<S> a phantom jet is a jet , except that its manifestation at low  lacks the usual peak that is regarded as the jet . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that how an ordinary jet may appear as a phantom jet depends on  and .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we have presented an interpretation of the ridge ( called pedestal there ) and explained why it appears visibly in the @xmath10 , but not in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> its dynamical origin is a hard parton traversing a portion of the medium near the surface ( how near the surface depends on how high  is ) ; the energy loss to the medium enhances the thermal partons locally , which in turn hadronize by thermal - thermal recombination resulting in the ridge . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ridge is a part of the jet produced by a high-  parton , but a jet does not necessarily have a ridge , as when  is so high as to select events in which the hard scattering occurs very near the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the peak above the ridge is a more direct consequence of hard scattering and is reproduced by the recombination of shower and thermal partons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the  of a pion that gives rise to the peak bends up from the exponential behavior of thermal - thermal recombination toward a power - law behavior @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the events with the  trigger are at the low end of  between 2.5 and 4.5 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> if one adopts the conventional presumption that a trigger particle is the fragment of a hard parton , then one would expect that there are , as usual , associated particles on the near side . </S>",
    "<S> if that is true , then the  spectrum would be power - law behaved , and @xmath24 would not be infinitesimal . currently , there are not enough -triggered events to separate the jet from the ridge . </S>",
    "<S> but we do know that the  of  is essentially exponential @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath6 quarks in hard scattering are suppressed , no shower partons contribute to  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ridge being formed from the enhanced thermal partons contains @xmath6 quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the recombination of 3 @xmath6-quarks in the ridge can form the trigger . since  is @xmath29 2.5 gev / c , the @xmath6 quarks need only have @xmath30 gev / c each to form the , which does not strain the thermal source . </S>",
    "<S> the light quarks in the ridge can easily form other hadrons with @xmath31 gev / c .    </S>",
    "<S> the recognition of  being formed from the ridge then solves the puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> being of thermal origin , its  is exponential . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the ridge being above the statistical background can be the source of associated seen in the @xmath11  @xcite , as has been obtained in the pion - triggered near - side  studied in the recombination model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excess of hadrons observed above the statistical background in the right panel of fig .  1 is entirely in the ridge .    to have the ridge without the jet ( peak ) </S>",
    "<S> is my conjecture based on a reasonable extrapolation from the observation that @xmath24 for @xmath27 trigger is @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the  puzzle does not depend crucially on the absence of the peak ( consisting of unidentified hadrons ) , but does depend on the presence of a large ridge when  is extended to as low as 1.5 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of phantom jet is quite appropriate , since the  production is actually due to a very hard scattering that gives rise to a sizable ridge , which can be accompanied by a jet that can be seen if  were higher . </S>",
    "<S> but that jet is not seen when  is pushed down to 1.5 gev / c for the purpose of increasing the statistics of observing the associated particles of the  trigger . at  as low as that , the ridge overwhelms the jet . in other words the phantom jet </S>",
    "<S> is not seen as a jet ; its shadow is the ridge that is seen .    </S>",
    "<S> one may ask how much of the calculation done in @xcite has been affected by the solution of the  puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> none at all . in all our study of the spectra at intermediate  </S>",
    "<S> we have always determined the thermal parton distribution from the data by fitting the soft hadron s at @xmath33 gev / c , since our investigations never attempted to solve the low-  problem @xcite . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we have found for @xmath34 production that @xmath35 gev , which is the same  temperature \" used to reproduce the  . </S>",
    "<S> that value of @xmath36 is @xmath37% higher than the value @xmath38 gev determined in the study of pion and proton production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference can partially be attributed to the flow effect of the more massive @xmath6 quarks , but now should also be recognized as being partially due to the enhanced thermal  of the ridge . </S>",
    "<S> the assertion made in @xcite about no associated particles in @xmath34- or -triggered events was based solely on the trigger being formed from the thermal partons . </S>",
    "<S> our error was in identifying the thermal partons as being in the statistical background . </S>",
    "<S> now , we identify them as being in the ridge that is above the background . </S>",
    "<S> that is a change in the qualitative prediction that involves no change in the quantitative calculation . </S>",
    "<S> thus the solution of the  puzzle does not invalidate any of the calculated results in @xcite .    to test our solution of the  puzzle </S>",
    "<S> , the following predictions can be checked . </S>",
    "<S> the ridge should be seen in @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the hadrons associated with  should have exponential behavior in . </S>",
    "<S> finally , among the associated particles the @xmath4 ratio should be high , since both hadrons are formed by recombination from the thermal partons in the ridge .    </S>",
