    "despite the fact that effect to background ratio is the central problem of all experimental physics , there is a certain class of experiments for which this problem is so crucial that even the possibility of their performance itself depends strongly on the reached background level of the used detectors .",
    "these are so called underground experiments devoted to investigation of the very rare or forbidden decays and processes like , for instance , double beta decay , proton decay , dark matter particles search , solar neutrino study and so on .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of such experiments is determined mainly ( except the available source strengths ) by the detector background .",
    "the first origin of background is due to cosmic rays and can be eliminated by the proper underground site for the set up .",
    "the second ( and the most crucial for sensitivity ) source of the background is the decays of the nuclides from the radioactive impurities in the detector itself , in the materials used for detector mounting and shielding , and in the surroundings .",
    "therefore it is obvious that simulation of the background and , in particular , simulation of the nuclides decays is the overwhelmingly important part of such kind of research which can allow : i ) to understand and determine the origins of the background and hence to find certain methods to eliminate or suppress the background contributions ; ii ) to build up the background model and response functions of the detector for the effect being sought ( together with the detector energy and efficiency calibrations , resolution , source activities , etc . ) , thus to extract and evaluate searched effect ( or to exclude it ) more precisely .",
    "there are several general programs , which are commonly used for simulation of the particles interactions in the experimental set up as , for example , geant package @xcite or egs4 code @xcite . in any",
    "such a program user should describe initial kinematics of events by using the so called event generator .",
    "the last is an important part of the simulation program providing the information , which particles and how many of them are emitted , what are their energies , directions of movement and times of emission .",
    "existing computer codes radlst @xcite and imrdec @xcite only determine the radiation spectra due to decay of nuclides , and therefore could not be used for the further particles tracking .    in attempt to cover this lack ,",
    "the code , named decay4 , was developed for generation of events in the low energy nuclear and particle physics ( double beta decay and decay of radioactive nuclides ) .",
    "this code was elaborated during the last decade , mainly for 2@xmath0 decay research @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as following : first , the overall features of the decay4 generator and used databases are considered , then detail descriptions of the parts associated with the double beta decay of atomic nuclei and decays of the natural and artificial radioactive nuclides are presented . in the last section",
    "several examples illustrating the use of the decay4 generator in the real underground experiments are shown .",
    "the developed program decay4 gives the possibility to generate events of the 2@xmath0 decay of atomic nuclei and of the radioactive decays ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 decay , electron capture ) of all known unstable isotopes .",
    "it is divided into two main sections :    \\a ) init  search and reading of all parameters of the nucleus and its decay needed for decay simulation from the ensdf @xcite ( or nudat @xcite ) , eadl @xcite and other libraries , in order to build up the nuclear and atomic decay schemes ;    \\b ) gendec  a monte carlo events generator itself .",
    "the ensdf database library includes the following information on about 2500 isotopes used for generation of the radioactive decays : a ) decay modes , their probabilities and energy releases , isotopes half - lives ; b ) radiation type , particles energies and intensities ; c ) parameters of nuclear levels ( half - life , spin , parity and excitation energy ) ; d ) parameters of nuclear transitions ( branching ratios , multipolarities , coefficients of internal conversion and mixing ratios ) .",
    "the decay4 code uses also tables with the data on atomic properties of isotopes ( electron binding energies , electron capture ( ec ) subshell ratios , x rays and auger electrons intensities ) from the eadl database @xcite ( as well as from @xcite ) and tables with theoretical hager - seltzer conversion coefficients @xcite .    the gendec part of the decay4 generates the energy , time of emission , direction and polarization for the following emitted particles : 1 ) electrons and positrons from single and double @xmath0 decay ; 2 ) @xmath1 particles from @xmath1 decay , protons and neutrons from @xmath5 and @xmath4 decays ; 3 ) @xmath6 quanta from nuclear deexcitation process ; 4 ) conversion electrons ; 5 ) e@xmath7e@xmath8 pairs from the internal pair conversion ; 6 ) @xmath9 quanta from bremsstrahlung in @xmath0 decay and ec ; 7 ) neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) from ec or @xmath0 ( 2@xmath0 ) decay ; 8) x rays and auger electrons from the atomic deexcitation process .",
    "the decay4 describes double beta processes ( 2@xmath10 and 2@xmath11 decays , electron capture with emission of positron @xmath12 and double electron capture 2@xmath13 ) for all nuclides .",
    "2@xmath0 transitions to the ground state as well as to excited 0@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 levels of the daughter nucleus are allowed .",
    "if 2@xmath0 decay occurs to an excited level of a nucleus , the electromagnetic deexcitation process follows .",
    "the energy release @xmath14 for double beta processes is taken from the table of the atomic masses @xcite .",
    "for each transition to the ground or an excited level , various modes ( with emission of two neutrinos or majoron , neutrinoless decays due to nonzero neutrino mass or right - handed admixture in the weak interaction , etc . ) and mechanisms ( two - nucleon @xmath15 and @xmath16-isobar n@xmath17 ) of double beta decay are possible . below we give the list of double beta processes which could be simulated with the decay4 :    1 . _ *  @xmath18 * _ decay with neutrino mass _ * , @xmath19 * _ transition _ * , @xmath15-*_mechanism ;    2 . _ *  @xmath18 * _ decay with right - handed currents , _ *  @xmath20 * _ transition _ * , @xmath15-*_mechanism ;    3 . _",
