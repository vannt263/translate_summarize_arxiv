    "in particular , the search for significant boundary values ( or initial conditions ) presents a non trivial problem .",
    "a simple and paradigmatic case of a flow is the stationary - zero - vorticity flow of a fluid with adiabatic stiff equation of state . in this case , for relativistic flows , the fluid equations admit analytical solutions for some particular metrics @xcite .",
    "these solutions are used as test - beds for testing almost all the numerical hydrodynamic codes in the subject .",

    "@xcite the authors used for the fluid the stiff equation of state , i.e. , a polytropic , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "this stiff equation of state over simplifies the partial differential equation for the velocity potential field @xmath4 ( it becomes linear ) . in this case",
    "the sound velocity in the fluid is equal to the speed of light .",
    "therefore the stiff equation of state represents a limit situation not easily encountered in usual physical situations . some articles @xcite studied the more realistic situation , a fluid with a polytropic equation of state with @xmath5 in the presence of either a rigid sphere or a black hole .",
    "the sound velocity in this case is less than the speed of light and the partial differential equation for @xmath4 turns to be nonlinear and needs to be solved numerically . in this work we present a nontrivial extension of the investigations about potential flows by studying the streamlines and baryon density contours for a fluid with polytropic equation of state with @xmath6 in the presence of either a rigid sphere or a black hole in a reissner - nordstrm-(anti ) de sitter background .",

    "the normalization condition , @xmath47 , gives us a relation between the enthalpy and the scalar field , @xmath48    this relation will be also useful to determine the baryon number density .    in this section we have followed the work of moncrief @xcite which is in accord with tabensky and taub @xcite who consider a constant barotropic sound speed , @xmath46 .",

    "there is no cosmological horizon and the function @xmath58 diverges as the radial coordinate @xmath59 tends to infinity .      to solve equation ( [ diffnlin ] ) in the space - time with metric ( [ metric ] )",
    "we assume : ( a ) that fluid is stationary , i.e. , the function @xmath4 depends on time only through the addition of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a constant related to the zeroth component of the velocity .",
    "( b ) that due to the axial symmetry of the metric the potential @xmath4 does not depend on the variable @xmath62 , and ( c ) that the fluid is a test fluid , i.e. the metric does not evolve and it is given _",

    "( [ diffnlin ] ) reduces to an elliptical differential equation with an inner boundary condition near the black hole or rigid sphere and an external boundary condition ( asymptotic condition ) .    to obtain the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ diffnlin ] ) we use a computational code based on a relaxation method with a second - order precision , five - point , finite difference scheme .",
    "the relaxation method employed is the _ stone s strongly implicit procedure _ applied in a numeric grid evenly spaced in both @xmath59 and @xmath63 .",
    "the whole method is detailed in reference @xcite .    in the case of a rigid sphere , for the inner boundary condition , the usual condition of zero normal velocity in the surface of the sphere is employed . in general",
    ", the fluid velocity must be equal to the corresponding component of the velocity of the surface .",
    "since usual stars have gaseous surfaces ( not hard ) , this condition does not describe a typical flow around a star .",
    "in special astrophysical situations , like relativistic flows around a neutron star , this condition can be valid . for a black hole we use the condition that the fluid particle number density must remain finite on the black hole horizon @xcite .",

    "we apply the dirichlet condition imposing that the fluid is homogeneous and has a constant velocity parallel to the z - axis of the coordinate system , say @xmath68    where @xmath69 .",
    "this condition is applied in a region located usually between the surface of the sphere ( or black hole horizon ) and 60 schwarzschild radius .",
    "note that the presence of a cosmological horizon ( for @xmath70 ) does not represent any further difficulty .",
    "our domain of interest is delimited to the asymptotic boundary condition , which we carefully apply in a radius much smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "to solve the non - linear equation ( [ diffnlin ] ) we first put the non - linear term equal to zero and calculate the linear part of the equation to find @xmath4 .",
    "this solution is used as an initial guess for the non - linear problem .",
    "then , from ( [ enthalpy ] ) we compute the fluid enthalpy .",
    "finally , with this information we compute the non - linear term that is introduced in the non - linear equation to find new values of @xmath4 .",
    "the process is repeated until the sum of the fractional change in the enthalpy for all interior points of the grid in one iteration is less than a certain error @xmath71 .",
    "usually less than 10 iterations were required to reach an error of @xmath72 . obviously , for the linear case we need only one iteration .",
    "the number of iterations depends on the value of @xmath7 .",
    "we found that for values of @xmath73 our code does not converge , this is because the enthalpy becomes negative in some points of our grid .",
    "so , this value of @xmath7 may represent a physical limit to our model .",
    "moreover , when @xmath74 the fluid is pressureless ( dust ) and the fluid flow is geodesic , i.e. , no longer obeys ( [ diffnlin ] ) .",
    "the code was tested for the case @xmath3 using the analytical results for the steady flow of a fluid in the presence of either a hard sphere @xcite or a black hole @xcite . in this case",
    "the numerical solution agreed with the exact solution within an error better than 1% for the radial velocity and angular velocity .",
    "this accuracy is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "another aspect of the fluid dynamics is the accretion rate of matter into a black hole .",
    "this accretion rate can be computed from ( [ potflow ] ) and ( [ density ] ) , we find @xmath75    where the integration is performed in a two - surface sphere centered on the black hole .",
    "the exact form of ( [ accretion ] ) , for @xmath3 , is known @xcite .",
    "it is @xmath76 , where @xmath54 is the event horizon and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the asymptotic density and zeroth component of the 4-velocity , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 is a constant in this case .",
    "we test our code to compute the accretion rate with this exact solution .",

    "[ fig1 ] , that the density decreases in the incident region and increases in the opposite side .",
    "these behaviors can be seen as a shift of the density contours ( more evident for @xmath83 ) and an expansion or contraction of the density contours ( more evident for @xmath84 ) .",
