    "since the famous heisenberg s paper @xcite had been published , uncertainty relations are the subject of long researches @xcite .",
    "a new interest was stimulated by recent advances in quantum information processing .",
    "there are two well - known approaches to formulating the uncertainty principle .",
    "the first was initiated by robertson @xcite who showed that a product of the standard deviations of two observables is bounded from below .",
    "here we may run across some disputable topics such as the number - phase case @xcite .",
    "both the well - defined hermitian operator of phase and corresponding number - phase uncertainty relation have been fit within the pegg - barnett formalism @xcite .",
    "the second approach is generally characterized by posing the uncertainty principle via information - theoretic terms especially via entropies @xcite .",
    "although the first relation of such a kind was derived by hirschman @xcite , a general statement of the problem is examined in the papers @xcite .",
    "mutually unbiased bases @xcite , the time - energy case @xcite and tomographic processes @xcite have been considered within an entropic approach as well .    the most of known uncertainty relations deals with observables or , more generally , with povm measurements .",
    "nevertheless , there exist relations for unitary transformations @xcite and non - hermitian annihilation operator @xcite .",
    "both the measurement and unitary evolution are rather simplest types of a state change in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the formalism of quantum operations , or super - operators , is now a standard tool for treating quantum processes . in the present work ,",
    "we address a question how to formulate the uncertainty principle for super - operators .",
    "it turns out that one of possible ways is naturally provided with the notion of extremal unraveling of a super - operator . for the shannon entropy , this notion was examined in @xcite . as an entropic measure , we will use the tsallis entropy , which has found use in various physical problems ( see references in @xcite ) , and the rnyi entropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the properties of the tsallis entropies and super - operators are recalled . for given input state and super - operator",
    ", we find the extremal unraveling that minimizes all the tsallis entropies simultaneously .",
    "relations between the ensemble entropy and the entropy of a generated density matrix are revisited . in section [ sec3 ] , we derive the uncertainty relation for two generalized resolutions of the identity in terms of tsallis entropies .",
    "the previous result on the rnyi entropies is refined .",
    "the obtained entropic relations are directly used for the extremal unravelings of two super - operator .",
    "section [ sec4 ] concludes the paper with a summary of results .",
    "first , we briefly recall the definitions of used entropic measures ( for a discussion and further references , see @xcite ) . for real @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", we define the non - extensive @xmath3-entropy of probability distribution @xmath4 by @xcite @xmath5 this can be rewritten as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the @xmath3-logarithmic function , defined for @xmath8 , @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity ( [ tsaent ] ) will be referred to as  tsallis @xmath3-entropy  , though it was previously discussed by havrda and charvt @xcite . in the limit @xmath10 , @xmath11 and",
    "the quantity ( [ tsaent ] ) recovers the shannon entropy .",
    "we will also use the rnyi @xmath3-entropy defined for @xmath2 as @xcite @xmath12 the rnyi @xmath3-entropy also coincides with the shannon entropy in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "there are many various forms of extrapolation between different entropies @xcite .",
    "we will only need in the equality @xmath13 which immediately follows from the definitions ( [ tsaent ] ) and ( [ renent ] ) .    in the following , some notation of linear algebra will be used .",
    "let @xmath14 be finite - dimensional hilbert space . for given two vectors @xmath15 ,",
    "their inner product is denoted by @xmath16 . for two operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 on @xmath14 , we define the hilbert ",
    "schmidt inner product by @xcite @xmath19 this inner product naturally induces so - called frobenius norm @xmath20 .",
    "the frobenius norm can be re - expressed as @xmath21 , where the singular values @xmath22 are eigenvalues of @xmath23 .",
    "the largest singular value of @xmath17 gives the spectral norm @xmath24 of this operator @xcite .",
    "a quantum measurement is described by a  generalized resolution of the identity  ( or by a  positive operator - valued measure  ) .",
    "this is a set @xmath25 of positive semidefinite operators obeying the completeness relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the identity @xcite .",
    "consider a linear map @xmath28 that takes linear operators on @xmath14 to linear operators on @xmath29 , and also satisfies the conditions of trace preservation and complete positivity . following @xcite , this map will be referred to as  super - operator  .",
    "each super - operator has a kraus representation , namely @xcite @xmath30 where the kraus operators @xmath31 map the input space @xmath14 to the output space @xmath29 and obey @xmath32 ( the preservation of the trace ) .",
    "representations of such a kind are never unique @xcite . for given super - operator @xmath28 ,",
    "there are many sets @xmath33 that enjoy ( [ opsum ] ) . in the paper @xcite , each concrete set @xmath33 resulting in ( [ opsum ] ) is called an  unraveling  of the super - operator @xmath28 .",

    "the matrix @xmath45 is hermitian .",
    "suppose that the two sets @xmath33 and @xmath46 fulfill ( [ eqvun ] ) .",
    "using the properties of the inner product , we have @xmath47 or @xmath48 as the matrix relation .",
    "that is , if the sets @xmath36 and @xmath37 are both unravelings of the same super - operator then the matrices @xmath45 and @xmath49 are unitarily similar . due to hermiticity ,",
    "all the matrices of a kind @xmath45 assigned to one and the same super - operator are unitarily similar to a unique ( up to permutations ) diagonal matrix @xmath50 , where the @xmath51 s and perhaps zeros are the eigenvalues of each of these matrices .",
    "so any @xmath45 is positive semidefinite .    for given unraveling @xmath33",
    ", we obtain the concrete matrix @xmath45 and diagonalize it through a unitary transformation @xmath52 .",
    "let us define a specific unraveling @xmath53 related to given @xmath36 as @xmath54 where the unitary matrix @xmath55 diagonalizes @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that the unraveling ( [ excalc ] ) enjoys the _ extremality _ property with respect to all the tsallis @xmath3-entropies for @xmath56 and the rnyi @xmath3-entropies for @xmath57 .",
    "[ extr ] for given density operator @xmath38 and super - operator @xmath28 , each unraveling @xmath36 of the @xmath28 satisfies @xmath58 where the extremal unraveling @xmath53 is defined by the formula ( [ excalc ] ) .",

    "further , we note that for @xmath71 the function @xmath72 is increasing in the range @xmath73 . combining the equality ( [ rentsa ] ) with ( [ tsaex ] ) then gives ( [ renex ] ) .",

    "latter reasons local in spirit are quite complemented by the above proof based on the concavity .",
    "our treatment allows to find the extremal unraveling easily from ( [ excalc ] ) .",
    "thus , for prescribed state @xmath38 all the tsallis entropies of order @xmath56 and the rnyi entropies of order @xmath57 are minimized by one and the same unraveling of given super - operator . however",

    "a search for such an unraveling seems to be difficult since rnyi s entropy of such an order is not purely convex nor purely concave .    the relations ( [ tsaex ] ) and ( [ renex ] ) can be put in the context of a state ensemble having a prescribed density operator . in line with ( [ tsaent ] ) and ( [ renent ] ) , we introduce the quantum tsallis and rnyi entropies of a density matrix @xmath38 by @xmath76 in the limit @xmath10 both the expressions coincides with the von neumann entropy @xmath77 .",

    "the last is a known relation between the von neumann entropy of the generated density operator and the shannon entropy of an ensemble @xcite . for",
    "the tsallis entropies this result can be proceeded to ensembles of mixed states .",
    "let an ensemble @xmath91 of normalized density operators , @xmath92 and @xmath80 , give rise to a density operator @xmath93 where the spectral decomposition @xmath94 .",

    "we further note that @xmath100 . in the limit @xmath10 ,",
    "the inequalities ( [ concmix ] ) are reduced to the well - known bounds on the von neumann entropy of a state mixture ( for instance , see @xcite ) .",
