    "originally introduced in quantum mechanics @xcite and later most widely used in high energy theory @xcite and condensed matter physics @xcite , path integrals have become important tools throughout the physical sciences from atomic , molecular and nuclear physics , to chemistry and biophysics .",
    "moreover , path integrals are starting to play important roles in several areas of mathematics and in modern finance @xcite , especially in option pricing applications @xcite .",
    "the downside of the formalism is that the mathematical properties of path integrals are not sufficiently well understood , and that an extremely small number of path integrals can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "an extensive overview of the path integral formalism and its various applications can be found in @xcite .    beside their key position in analytical approaches to quantum theory ,",
    "path integrals have an important role in direct numerical simulations of realistic many - body systems .",
    "such simulations have made possible practical comparisons of the predictions of various theoretical models with the results of associated experiments .",
    "further , they have led to a deeper understanding of the complex physical phenomena involved @xcite .",
    "the starting point in all such calculations is the time - sliced expression for the general quantum - mechanical transition amplitude @xcite , @xmath5 from initial state @xmath6 to final state @xmath7 , for time interval @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the number of time slices , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the naively discretized action for a system of @xmath11 non - relativistic particles in @xmath12 spatial dimensions .",
    "the @xmath13 limit of the above discretized amplitude gives the continuum amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "the evaluation of these types of discretized expressions is handled by a variety of well developed numerical integration methods , and this is one of the principle reasons for the popularity of the path integral approach in numerical simulations .",
    "the performance of numerical algorithms for the calculation of path integrals is determined by the efficiency of the applied integration techniques , as well as by the speed of convergence of the discretized amplitudes to the continuum .",
    "the first aspect has been successfully dealt with by numerous monte carlo integration methods based on efficient sampling of trajectories .",
    "the second is usually addressed by the use of better discretizations , i.e by substituting better effective actions for the naively discetized action .",
    "the underlying idea here is to construct and use effective actions that lead to improved convergence of physical expressions to the ( same ) continuum limit .    typically",
    ", physical expression calculated using the naively discretized action converge to the continuum as @xmath1 .",
    "a review of a variety of effective actions constructed by improving short - time propagation and using generalizations of the trotter - suzuki formula @xcite , together with their ranges of application and dependence on ordering prescriptions , are given in @xcite .",
    "for a long time now , the state of the art result has been the @xmath15 convergence of discretized partition functions obtained by takahashi and imada @xcite , and li and broughton @xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors used a generalized form @xcite of the trotter formula and the cyclic property of the trace to increase the speed of convergence of the discretized partition functions to @xmath15 .",
    "we stress that this increase in the speed of convergence only holds for partition functions and not for amplitudes .",
    "some recent results regarding the efficient implementation of pimc algorithms may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in general , the main feature of the improved effective action",
    " faster approach to the continuum limit , i.e with smaller number of time slices  translates into numerical speedup , simpler integration and smaller statistical fluctuations of the quantities calculated .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have introduced the concept of the ideal effective action @xmath16 .",
    "discretized amplitudes calculated with the ideal effective action do not depend on the discretization coarseness @xmath0 , i.e. they are all equal to the sought - after continuum amplitude @xmath17 note that for free particles @xmath16 is in fact just the naively discretized action . in @xcite we derived the integral equation for the ideal action for a single particle moving in one spatial dimension in a general potential .",
    "we then solved this integral equation as an asymptotic expansion in @xmath18 .",
    "the obtained truncation of the ideal effective action @xmath19 to order @xmath20 systematically improves convergence to the continuum to @xmath2 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to the naive action . up to now",
    "the work has focused on one particle theories in one dimension . within this set of theories",
    "the outlined procedure has been used to determine explicit expressions for the set of effective discretized actions up to level @xmath23 .",
    "the ensuing speedup of several orders of magnitude has been verified by extensive numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the speedup holds for the calculation of all path integrals  for transition amplitudes , partition functions , energy expectation values ( in combination with appropriate energy estimators ) , as well as for calculations of energy levels . in this paper",
    "we extend the above method to the physically relevant case of general many - particle non - relativistic systems in arbitrary number of spatial dimensions .",
    "this is done within a new analytical approach to the construction of the effective actions hierarchy .",
    "the new approach gives the same effective actions as the the old one when applied to one particle one dimensional theory , however its computational complexity is lower , making it possible to determine effective actions at higher @xmath3 levels . in particular , the new approach allows for a relatively straight - forward extension of the formalism to many - body theories and arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the present paper gives the analytical derivation of these results , as well as a series of monte carlo simulations implementing the newly derived effective actions and explicitly displaying that the derived speedup indeed holds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : eff ] introduces the hierarchy of effective discretized actions and gives the new and extended ( many particles , higher dimensions ) analytical approach to the construction of these effective actions . section [ sec : num ] presents numerical results that demonstrate the validity of the analytically derived speedup in convergence .",
    "the efficiency of the new approach is further demonstrated in section [ sec : spec ] through the calculation of energy spectra .",
    "a construction of virial energy estimators corresponding to newly derived effective actions and the results of numerical simulations that implement them are given in section [ sec : est ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief summary of obtained results , indicating what we see to be the next steps in our line of research and its future applications .",
    "appendix a gives a list of integration formulas needed for calculations up to level @xmath4 .",
    "appendix b lists the corresponding effective actions representing the new state - of - the - art for path integral calculations of non - relativistic many - body systems in arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "higher level effective actions can be found on our web site @xcite .",
    "we present a method for systematically increasing the efficiency of pimc calculations of a non - relativistic quantum system consisting of @xmath11 distinguishable particles in @xmath12 spatial dimensions , with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the usual kinetic energy operator , and @xmath26 is the potential describing inter - particle interactions and interactions with external fields .",
    "the above set of theories encompasses a large number of physically relevant models .",
    "however , as we shall see from the derivations , the method is in principle applicable to all quantum theories .",
    "for the considered class of theories , the naively discretized action @xmath10 is @xmath27 vectors with one index ( e.g. @xmath28 ) represent the set of positions of all particles after @xmath29 time steps of length @xmath9 , while vectors with two indices ( e.g. @xmath30 ) represent @xmath12-dimensional positions of particle @xmath31 at time step @xmath32 .",

    ", we may think of a configuration ( trajectory ) of the quantum system as a single vector @xmath35 whose individual components @xmath36 take on @xmath37 possible values , representing positions of all the particles at a given time step . in this notation the @xmath38 limit of the above discretized amplitude",

    "@xmath42 calculated to first order in time step @xmath18 , leading to the naive action in equation ( [ eq : base ] ) .",
    "this is what gives the @xmath1 convergence to standard path integral expressions .",
    "a faster converging result may be obtained by evaluating the amplitudes under the integral to higher orders in @xmath18 . from the above completeness relation ,",
    "it follows that the ideal discretized action @xmath16 leads to exact propagation in time , and is given in terms of the exact amplitude , according to @xmath43 the ideal discretized action @xmath16 is simply the sum of expressions @xmath44 : @xmath45    full knowledge of the ideal action @xmath16 is equivalent to knowing the exact expression for all the amplitudes @xmath46 . at first",
    ", this would seem to indicate that nothing new is to be gained by equation ( [ eq : ideal ] ) .",
    "this , however , is not the case .",
    "we will use equation ( [ eq : ideal ] ) to input new analytical information into our numerical procedure by calculating amplitudes within some available analytical approximation scheme .",
    "we focus on the calculation of the short time propagation as a power series expansion in @xmath18 , which starts from the naive action ( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "the details of this calculation have been inspired by a similar derivation given in @xcite .",
    "one can also attack the problem of solving equation ( [ eq : ideal ] ) using various other approximative schemes , especially in the case when short time approximation is not appropriate .",
    "the application of the feynman and kleinert variational approach @xcite , further developed in @xcite , could prove useful is such cases .    improved @xmath2 convergence of path integrals follows from calculating the general short - time amplitude @xmath42 up to the order @xmath47 . to this end",

    "the free particle expectation value in equations ( [ eq : main1 ] ) and ( [ eq : formal ] ) is calculated using a taylor expansion in powers of @xmath61 : @xmath62 with shorthand notation @xmath63 . by expanding @xmath64 around the referent trajectory @xmath49",
    ", we get @xmath65 from now on we assume summation over repeated indices .",
    "the expectation values of products @xmath66 are now calculated in the standard way with the help of the free - particle generating functional given in terms of the propagator : @xmath67 from this follow the usual wick s theorem results @xmath68 , @xmath69 , etc . note that the generating functional ( and so all the expectation values ) is independent of the specific choice of referent trajectory , i.e. the boundary conditions for the @xmath53 are the same for all choices of @xmath49 , and so the propagator is always given by ( [ eq : propagator ] ) .",
    "different choices of @xmath49 simplify different approximation schemes : using the classical trajectory for @xmath49 is optimal for recovering semi - classical expansion , the choice of linear referent trajectories will turn out to be optimal for short - time expansion .",
    "we next wish to perform the remaining integrations over @xmath57 . because of the explicit dependence of the referent trajectory on @xmath57 , we first expand the potential and all its derivatives in ( [ eq : uexp ] ) around some reference point .",

    "the choice of linear referent trajectories @xmath72 makes all of these integrals solvable in closed form , allowing us to determine the ideal effective action .    before doing these explicit calculations ,",
    "we first look at which terms need to be retained in order to get the sought - after @xmath2 convergence .",
    "it is easy to show that the ideal effective action is a sum of terms of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are nonnegative whole numbers constrained by simple dimensional analysis to satisfy @xmath77 short time propagation satisfies the diffusion relation @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 convergence follows from keeping all the terms satisfying @xmath79 .",
    "an equivalent , but practically more useful , form of the criterion determining the relevant terms at level @xmath3 is @xmath80    we now continue with the explicit evaluation of the ideal effective action , illustrating the general procedure on calculations to level @xmath81 .",

    "the obtained @xmath1 dependence gives explicit verification of the analytically derived increase in convergence .",
    "the typical case is illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the expected @xmath2 convergence may be most easily discerned from figure [ fig:2 ] , a plot of the deviations of discretized amplitudes from the continuum limit . as can be seen",

    "on the other hand , figure [ fig:2 ] is itself time consuming since it illustrates subdominant behavior .",
    "for this reason the figures contain only results obtained by effective actions to level @xmath4 .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath4 curve corresponds to a precision of four decimal places even for an extremely coarse discretization such as @xmath99 .    in usual pimc calculations",
    "one always chooses the number of mc samples so that the stochastic error of numerical results is of the order of deviations from the continuum limit . in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "the number of mc samples had to be much larger , in order for deviations from the continuum limit to be clearly visible .",
    "the improved convergence of path integral expressions for amplitudes leads directly to the same kind of improvement in the convergence of discretized partition functions , owing to the relation @xmath100 where the inverse temperature @xmath75 plays the role of the time of propagation @xmath8 . from the previous relation",
    "we directly obtain the path - integral presentation of the partition function : @xmath101 the partition function is the central object for obtaining information about statistical systems .",
    "in addition , the partition function offers a straightforward way for extracting information about low lying energy levels of a system .",
    "this follows from evaluating the trace in the definition of the partition function in the energy eigen - basis @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote corresponding energy levels and degeneracies .",

    "similarly , we introduce auxiliary functions @xmath107 which can be fitted for large @xmath75 to @xmath108 and which tend to the corresponding energy level @xmath103 .    in this way , by studying the large @xmath75 behavior of the free energy and the corresponding auxiliary functions , one obtains the low lying energy spectrum of the model .",
    "however , in numerical simulations we are inevitably limited to a finite range of inverse temperatures .",
    "in addition , the above procedure for the construction of the auxiliary functions @xmath109 is recursive , i.e. in order to construct @xmath109 we need to know all the energy levels below @xmath103 .",
    "this leads to the accumulation of errors as @xmath29 increases , practically limiting the number of energy levels that can be calculated .",
    "note that the orders of magnitude increase in precision of the presented method reduces the magnitude of the accumulated error and thus allows us to extract a larger number of energy levels .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] illustrate the calculation of low lying energy levels using the more efficient pimc formalism presented in this paper on the case of a two - dimensional system of two distinguishable particles interacting through a quartic potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
