    "@xmath19 is @xmath20 wilson loop and @xmath21 is the bare coupling constant of the theory .",
    "the basic computational task in lattice qcd is the evaluation of the partition function given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the haar and grassmann measures respectively .",
    "the computing problem has @xmath25 complexity ( i.e. it is np - hard ) and one has to resort to stochastic estimations of the right hand side ( [ z_qcd ] ) .",
    "in fact , integration over the grassmann fields can be performed exactly to give : @xmath26      i will use a linear function of plaquette to characterize the degree of the non - smoothness on the lattice . let @xmath27 be the average @xmath20 wilson loop over all lattice plaquettes .",
    "then i define the following real and positive function : @xmath28 smooth gauge fields are characterized by small values of @xmath29 .",
    "typical values from lattice simulations are @xmath30 , which is a clear indication of non - smoothness of the lattice gauge fields .    to see the influence of the non - smoothness on a typical gauge invariant lattice operator , i consider eigenvalue perturbations of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "let @xmath31 be an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath32 .",
    "a classical result from the eigenvalue perturbation theory states that variation of an eigenvalue @xmath33 under matrix perturbation @xmath34 is bounded by @xcite : @xmath35 the following result relates the 2-norm of the matrix @xmath36 to the degree of the non - smoothness @xmath29 on the lattice ( [ non_smoothness ] ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are positive constants .",
    "this result is proven in appendix a. together with the bound ( [ eig_pert ] ) it gives : @xmath40 the above inequality ( [ eig_pert2 ] ) states that the eigenvalue fluctuations on a lattice with smooth gauge fields are likely to be smaller than those on a lattice with non - smooth gauge fields .",
    "however , as present computing resources do not allow a close approach to continuum limit , _ it is important to look for formulations and algorithms with reduced effects of lattice non - smoothness .",
    "_    numerical results of @xcite indicate that large eigenvalues of the lattice dirac operator are merely lattice artifacts .",
    "it is a well - known fact that cutoff modes are poorly represented on the lattice .",
    "but one may not simply exclude them from simulations since the existence of the theory may be compromised .",
    "the strategy followed in this paper is the suppression of the high fermion modes of the lattice theory .",
    "as shown below it is possible to model a fermion theory with the reduced appearance of these modes .",
    "recent progress with chiral fermions on the lattice has shown that a theory of five dimensional fermions can be a useful modeling tool ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "domain wall boundary conditions along the fifth dimension provide a kinematical model for qcd with chiral fermions which are `` localized '' on the surface of a five dimensional world . the theory in five dimensions",
    "can be viewed as a fermion system propagating along the fifth euclidean dimension with its dynamics generated by a certain hamiltonian operator @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be creation and destruction operators in the fock space which satisfy the anti - commutation relations : @xmath45_+ = { \\text{\\fontshape{n}\\selectfont 1\\kern-.56exl}}\\ ] ] they carry spin and color indices , which are not explicitly shown for clarity .",
    "@xmath44 acts on the bare vacuum state which they annihilate .",
    "i define the hamiltonian operator of the fermion system by the bilinear form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hermitian lattice dirac operator in four dimensions given by : @xmath48 let @xmath49 be the lattice size in the fifth dimension or the `` the inverse temperature '' of the quantum statistical system with the partition function @xmath50 , given by : @xmath51 to compute the trace of an operator in the fock space i use the standard technique of the grassmann coherent states with antiperiodic boundary conditions in the fifth euclidean coordinate .",
    "since @xmath42 is quadratic it is easy to show that : @xmath52 i _ define _ the measure density of the non - trivial fermion theory on the lattice by the following equation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a function of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "i choose it such that the right hand side is given by : @xmath55 such an operator exists as it is shown in the framework of domain wall fermions @xcite .",
    "hence the resulting density can be written as : @xmath56 this suggests that an effective theory in four dimensions may be defined by the following lattice dirac operator : @xmath57 where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing of the four dimensional lattice and @xmath58 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "it is clear that for small lattice spacing this operator approaches the wilson dirac operator and hence has the correct continuum limit .    in order to give to the tr@xmath59 operator a precise meaning ,",
    "i _ define _ a fermion theory in five dimensions by the following action : @xmath60 here the five dimensional fermion field @xmath61 satisfies periodic boundary conditions in all directions and @xmath62 is defined by : @xmath63 it can be shown that : _ the measure density of the five dimensional theory ( [ s_5 ] ) is proportional to the measure of the effective theory defined by eq .",
    "( [ omega])_. the proof is given in appendix b.    this result suggests that the four dimensional lattice theory with wilson fermions can be approached by the ` high temperature ' limit of a theory with wilson fermions in five dimensions .",
    "thus , it is natural to choose the length of the extra dimension to be proportional to the lattice spacing in four dimensions .",
    "dimensional reduction is then realized by taking the continuum limit of the theory .",
    "furthermore , the theory allows the introduction of a dimensionless parameter @xmath64 which can be used to suppress the high momentum modes of the fermion theory to a prescribed level , i.e. @xmath64 can be viewed as a dimensionless ` temperature ' . a ` cold ' theory",
    "would then correspond to the quenched approximation , whereas a ` hot ' one would be identical to the wilson theory",
    ".    in the next section i will give the basic properties of the dimensionally reduced effective theory .",
    "it is clear that the above theory defined in 4@xmath411 dimensions has all desired properties of a field theory : it is local , unitary and gauge invariant .",
    "this is not obvious for the dimensionally reduced theory with a lattice dirac operator given by ( [ d_operator ] ) : @xmath65 for free fermions the lattice dirac operator has a momentum space representation given by : @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the four - momentum vector .",
    "the momentum space wilson dirac operator is given by : @xmath68 whereas its square is given by : @xmath69 ^ 2\\ ] ]      whilst @xmath70 links only nearest neighbour lattice points , @xmath71 will be a full matrix .",
    "a full matrix can be considered essentially local if it is dominated by matrix elements which link lattice points that are close to each other .",
    "for example , this will be the case if the magnitude of @xmath72 decays exponentially with the distance @xmath73 .",
    "this will be considered as a sufficient condition in the following for locality ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath74 is analytic and @xmath75-periodic for @xmath76 , then its fourier transform falls off exponentially at large distances ( see @xcite for a similar argument ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 _ is a local operator in the above sense_.    the locality of the fermion theory in a gauge field background is treated in appendix c. in particular , it is shown that if the wilson dirac operator is singular the locality of the theory is guaranteed solely by the positivity of @xmath64 .      for unitarity it is sufficient to show that the lattice operator leads to non - negative energy spectrum with non - negative norm of eigenmodes .",
    "to do this i define a positive function @xmath77 in terms of the real variable @xmath78 : @xmath79 since @xmath80 is an odd function of @xmath78 , one can easily show that the right hand side is in fact a function of @xmath81 only .",
    "therefore , i can define a function @xmath82 such that : @xmath83 this way , i may write : @xmath84 using the definition of an operator - valued function the lattice dirac operator ( [ d_operator ] ) takes the form : @xmath85\\ ] ] now note that the matrix function @xmath86 is non - singular .",
    "hence the poles in the fermion propagator are identical to those in the wilson theory and the resulting theory is characterized by a real energy spectrum . moreover , since @xmath86 is positive definite the norm of energy eigenmodes remains positive .",
    "the fermion propagator is given by the inverse of the expression ( [ inverse_propagator ] ) .",
    "as usual , gauge fields are parametrized by @xmath87 elements : @xmath88 and the wilson operator is written as a sum of the free and interaction terms : @xmath89 the splitting of the lattice dirac operator is written in the same form : @xmath90 where the interaction term has to be determined .",
    "this can be done by expanding @xmath71 in terms of @xmath91 : @xmath92\\ ] ] where @xmath93 are real expansion coefficients .",
    "calculation of @xmath94 is outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "in fact it is an easy task if one stays with a finite number of terms in the right hand side of ( [ pert_expan ] ) .",
    "also , the number of terms can be minimized using a chebyshev approximation for the hyperbolic tangent .",
    "tuning @xmath64 and then fixing it to a certain value is essential in specifying the level of uv suppression and the fermion theory as such . on the practical side",
    "one should know how to choose the value of @xmath64 such that only the infrared modes are included .",
    "this can be done by computing explicitly the eigenvalue density of the input operator @xmath47 and identify the threshold between the physical modes and the tail of the distribution .",
    "following definition ( [ wilson_op ] ) and the technique of @xcite one can approximate the density of zero eigenvalues @xmath95 of @xmath96 at a given bare quark mass @xmath14 .",
    "1 shows four example plots of low lying eigenvalue densities from the paper of @xcite . at small @xmath14",
    "the density is zero and then jumps at a non - zero value at the critical mass @xmath97 where the wilson operator becomes singular .",
    "then as @xmath14 increases one can identify a threshold @xmath98 where the density approaches a plateau .",
    "it is this plateau where the uv effects dominate the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "according to this heuristics one can suppress the eigenvalues beyond @xmath98 and the value of @xmath64 can be determined by : @xmath99 from fig.1 one can estimate @xmath100 .",
    "the effective action of a fermion theory can be written as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a hermitian matrix and @xmath103 is a real and smooth function of @xmath104 . to see the effects of uv suppression",
    "one can compute the change of the effective action between two background @xmath7 gauge fields .",
    "since it is difficult to compute the trace directly one can use the noisy estimators of the type @xmath105 where @xmath78 is a @xmath106 niose vector .",
    "it is easy to show that the random variable @xmath107 has expectation value @xmath108 and variance : @xmath109 note that bilinear forms of the type @xmath110 can be computed using lanczos based methods as described by @xcite .",
    "i have used the lanczos algorithm as it appears in the paper of @xcite .",
    "2 shows the distribution of @xmath107 and its variation @xmath111 between two configurations for wilson and uv - suppressed fermions , i.e. @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "the figure shows clearly that changes @xmath111 in the effective action estimator are reduced by an order of magnitude for uv - suppressed fermions as compared to wilson fermions .",
    "in this paper a lattice theory with suppressed cutoff modes of the fermion determinant is proposed .",
    "the level of suppression can be tuned by a new parameter @xmath64 that enters the theory . for @xmath114",
    "one recovers wilson fermions whereas for @xmath115 one gets the quenched theory . for general @xmath64",
    "the theory is similar to a wilson theory with the effective cutoff @xmath116 .    by fixing @xmath64 at the appropriate value one can reduce considerably the uv fluctuations in the fermion determinant while preserving the interesting infrared modes of the theory . thus one can eleminate the need to separate and then devise algorithms for the uv modes .",
    "the fermion thoery described here can be easily extended to other input fermions such as staggered or chiral fermions .",
    "to prove the statement i use similar algebraic manipulations to those used elsewhere in a different context @xcite . here",
    "they appear in greater detail .",
    "i let the lattice spacing in the fifth direction to be : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the number of lattice points in the fifth direction .",
    "the approximate fermion measure density can be defined by : @xmath131 with @xmath132 being a classical transfer matrix : @xmath133 it is easy to see that for small lattice spacing @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "it is only necessary to show that : @xmath136 where @xmath137 as @xmath138 .",
    "the right hand side can be realized for example as the determinant of the following @xmath139 block matrix : @xmath140 where the sign of the left lower corner reverses if the boundary conditions of @xmath62 change from periodic to antiperiodic .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the two determinants will be given by : @xmath141 one must now calculate @xmath142 from @xmath62 .",
    "the fermion matrix can be written as an @xmath139 block partition in the fifth dimension : @xmath143 where @xmath144 are the usual spin projector operators in the fifth direction .",
    "i multiply the above matrix from the left with the following permutation matrix : @xmath145 and i obtain the following result : @xmath146 comparing this matrix to that containing @xmath142 ( [ tilde_t ] ) i arrive at the following expression for the transfer matrix : @xmath147 which goes to @xmath148 for small lattice spacing @xmath134 . since @xmath132 and @xmath148 are equivalent transfer matrices the proof is concluded .",
    "to show locality of @xmath71 it is sufficient to show that the matrix - valued function @xmath86 ( [ f_definition ] ) is a local operator .",
    "let @xmath149norm of the vector @xmath150 be defined by : @xmath151 with @xmath152 . the _ induced matrix norm _ of @xmath153",
    "is defined by : @xmath154 if @xmath155 are two lattice points in four dimensions , i will refer to the matrix element @xmath156 of the matrix function @xmath82 as @xmath157 .",
    "note that these elements are in fact matrices which carry spin and color indices , which i suppress for clarity .",
    "i will show in the following that : @xmath158 for any @xmath58 and four dimensional lattice points @xmath155 .    in order to prove ( [ exp_bound ] ) i need first to approximate the function @xmath82 . from appendix b",
    "one can infer that a five dimensional formulation gives a fermion measure density proportional to @xmath159",
    ". therefore one can write : @xmath160 this suggests the following approximation to the function @xmath82 : @xmath161 the right hand side can be expressed as a partial fraction by computing its poles and corresponding residues : @xmath162 now i consider the matrix valued function @xmath163 with the matrix @xmath164 substituted for the variable @xmath78 and show first that it is local for any approximation order @xmath130 .    to simplify the notation , i call @xmath165 the matrix : @xmath166 and write : @xmath167 = \\frac{1}{2n^2 } \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{a_k}\\ ] ]",
    "i use a geometric series to approximate the inverse of @xmath165 in order to keep the discussion simple ( however note that a chebyshev approximation is more accurate and is likely to decrease the exponent base @xmath39 of ( [ exp_bound ] ) in the final result @xcite ) .",
    "i may write : @xmath168 and then define : @xmath169 from the definition of the 2-norm i obtain : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the condition number of @xmath165 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath172 are non - negative ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "let @xmath174 be the extreme singular values of @xmath175 .",
    "then @xmath176 can be written as : @xmath177 or @xmath178 but since @xmath179 for @xmath180 ( the range of @xmath181 argument values for @xmath182 ) i obtain : @xmath183 ^ 2}{\\sigma_2 ^ 2 } } \\ ] ] clearly , i have : @xmath184 now i may expand the right hand side of ( [ one_over_ak ] ) in geometric series to obtain : @xmath185\\ ] ] further , i let the matrix @xmath186 to be : @xmath187 such that the matrix elements of @xmath188 can be given by : @xmath189 since @xmath190 vanishes for those lattice points @xmath155 such that @xmath191 , one may conclude that : @xmath192 in general i have : @xmath193 using ( [ rho_1 ] ) , ( [ ml_zero ] ) and ( [ ml_leq1 ] ) , i obtain : @xmath194\\ ] ] but @xmath195 for @xmath196 . hence finally : @xmath197 since the left hand side is uniformly bounded the result also holds in the limit @xmath198 .",
    "hence the hypothesis ( [ exp_bound ] ) is proven with the constants @xmath199 given by : @xmath200    _ remark_. if the wilson dirac operator is singular ( at @xmath201 , or at the `` critical hopping parameter '' ) the locality of the theory is guaranteed solely by the positivity of @xmath64 .",
