    "the computational complexity of boolean formula satisfiability has been the focus of intensive research for decades .",
    "recently , a promising approach to understanding the algorithmic difficulty of @xmath0-sat has emerged , in the form of rigorous analysis of the structural properties of formulas drawn at random from certain distributions . for example , a natural distribution which has been studied extensively is the uniform distribution over @xmath0-cnf formulas with exactly @xmath8 clauses over @xmath3 variables .",
    "we denote this distribution by @xmath9 . despite its simple description ,",
    "many fundamental properties of this model are yet to be understood .",
    "for example , the computational complexity of deciding if a random formula is satisfiable and of finding a satisfying assignment are both major open problems @xcite .    the clause to variable ratio @xmath10 of a formula is referred to as the _ density _ of the formula .",
    "the random model @xmath9 exhibits a `` phase transition '' in satisfiability , where sparse formulas are likely to be satisfiable whereas dense formulas are unlikely to be satisfiable .",
    "moreover , this phase transition happens at a very short density interval .",
    "there exists a satisfiability threshold @xmath11 such that @xmath0-cnf formulas with density @xmath12 are not satisfiable @xmath13 ) to mean with probability tending to @xmath14 as @xmath3 tends to infinity . ] , while formulas with @xmath15 are satisfiable @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "a first - moment - method calculation provides an upper - bound of @xmath16 , and the threshold is conjectured to be within a constant distance of this upper - bound ( for all values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "a lower - bound of @xmath17 was established rigorously using a weighted second - moment - method in @xcite .    for a satisfiable @xmath0-cnf formula @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the maximal hamming distance between a pair of satisfying assignments of @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we study the behavior of @xmath19 as a function of the density .",
    "specifically , we will consider random satisfiable formulas , and ask what the typical value of @xmath20 is likely to be at various densities .",
    "observe that as one adds more clauses to a formula , the set of satisfying assignments can only decrease , and hence also @xmath20 can only decrease .",
    "this indicates that the typical value of @xmath20 should decrease as the density increases .",
    "however , when the formula becomes unsatisfiable , the formula is discarded from consideration .",
    "since the formulas of lowest diameter ( diameter 0 ) are those discarded from consideration , and their proportion increases as the density increases , this may conceivably lead to a situation in which as the density increases the expected diameter increases rather than decreases . in particular , there does not seem to be an a - priori reason why the threshold for satisfiability should correspond to a threshold behavior also with respect to the diameter of satisfiable formulas .",
    "let us review what is known about @xmath19 at densities below the satisfiability threshold .",
    "for @xmath21 we know that all but @xmath22-fraction of the formulas satisfy @xmath23 ( this is because they are satisfied as nae-@xmath0-sat instances @xcite ) .",
    "the results in @xcite imply that for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , for all but @xmath22-fraction of satisfiable @xmath0-cnf formulas @xmath19 is at least @xmath26 ( this is true for @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "this large diameter is due to the existence of many small clusters of satisfying assignments , which are  spread \" in the space of all @xmath29 possible assignments .",
    "physicists conjecture that this picture persists up to the so - called condensation point at @xmath30 , for some constant @xmath31 , at which point the number of remaining clusters drops to polynomial and then maybe to constant .",
    "true or not , this conjecture does not imply that @xmath19 becomes small , because it can remain of value roughly @xmath2 even when there are only two clusters . for densities much higher than the satisfiability threshold ( by a factor of roughly @xmath32 ) , the typical value of @xmath19 is  0 , because such formulas , if satisfiable , are likely to have only one satisfying assignment ( see for example  @xcite for the case of 3-cnf ) .",
    "this shows that the diameter of random satisfiable formulas does undergo a phase transition as the density increases ( starting at @xmath3 , and eventually reaching 1 ) , but it is not clear whether there is any density that serves as a threshold around which there is a sharp drop in diameter .    in this paper",
    "we show that :    [ thm : clusteringuniform ] for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 , all but a @xmath22-fraction of satisfiable @xmath0-cnf formulas @xmath18 with @xmath8 clauses over @xmath3 variables satisfy @xmath35    our result proves that there occurs a transition from a typical structure of satisfying assignments which are wide - spread in the @xmath3-dimensional binary cube , to a structure where all satisfying assignments are typically contained in a ball of small diameter .",
    "the window in which this phase transition occurs is contained in @xmath36 $ ] , where both @xmath37 tend to 0 as @xmath0 grows .",
    "here are a few interesting observations regarding this phase transition .    1 .",
    "the threshold phenomenon in @xmath20 occurs at a window of densities that lies around @xmath38 , and whose width is a low - order term w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 . since we are considering only satisfiable @xmath0-cnf formulas ( below or above the threshold )",
    ", there is no a - prior reason for this threshold to be found in the vicinity of the satisfiability threshold ( as the latter is irrelevant for such formulas ) .",
    "still , as our result shows , this is the case .",
    "since we are looking at satisfiable formulas , this is not a product distribution . therefore some methods for establishing threshold behaviors ( such as @xcite ) are not applicable .",
    "3 .   consider the property of having a diameter of at least @xmath40 .",
    "this is not necessarily a monotone property of the density ( at least we are not aware of an easy proof that it is ) . again",
    ", this shows that some approaches to prove the existence of such threshold ( such as @xcite ) may not be applicable .",
    "4 .   typically @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "this is because at those ratios most formulas are satisfiable as nae-@xmath0-sat formulas @xcite ( in which case for every satisfying assignment in the nae manner , also its complement at distance @xmath3 is satisfying ) .",
    "numerical calculations using tools from statistical physics predict that at @xmath43 there is a phase transition from a typical structure of a big connected ball of satisfying assignments into many small balls of satisfying assignments ( which are called clusters ) .",
    "observe that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , therefore while there is a major change in the structure of the solution space , @xmath20 is not affected .",
    "let us briefly discuss what happens for @xmath46 .",
    "our approach assumes that @xmath47 is a low - order term compared with @xmath39 .",
    "this is however not true ( or not relevant ) when @xmath0 is small .",
    "also , the fact that we have a constant like 50 in the bound on @xmath20 makes the result trivial for small values of @xmath0 . on the other hand , for",
    "fixed @xmath0 ( say @xmath48 ) one can numerically estimate the value of @xmath20 ( via the same methods used in the proof of theorem [ thm : clusteringuniform ] , just figuring out the exact numerics instead of a rigorous , less tight , estimation that we perform ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 the numerics show that typically @xmath49 for density @xmath50 ( which is @xmath51 for @xmath48 ) .",
    "questions regarding the structure of the solution space guided the development of algorithms in similar contexts in the past ( two such examples are algorithms that were developed for 3cnf formulas with a planted solution , and the intuition that served the development of the survey propagation algorithm ) . in this paper",
    "we limit our study to some structural properties of the solution space and do not address algorithmic aspects , though hopefully our new insights can serve the algorithmic perspective at some point as well .",
    "more precisely , while the algorithmic and structural understanding of below - threshold random formulas and above - threshold ( for sufficiently large , yet constant , density ) is rather thorough ( a short list for the below threshold regime could be @xcite and @xcite for the above threshold ) , there is no rigorous algorithmic result for clause - variable ratio @xmath52 when @xmath53 is some constant above the satisfiability threshold , but not  sufficiently large \" .",
    "( for the special case of @xmath48 there are some experimental results in  @xcite . )",
    "one reasonable approach to prove theorem [ thm : clusteringuniform ] is to consider the * uniform distribution * over satisfiable @xmath0-cnf formulas with @xmath8 clauses over @xmath3 variables , and study @xmath19 of a random instance in that distribution . throughout @xmath54 denotes the uniform distribution .",
    "more specifically , we consider a random formula @xmath18 from @xmath54 and estimate the expected number of pairs of satisfying assignments at distance @xmath55 from each other .",
    "a similar approach was used for example in @xcite for random formulas in the below - threshold regime .",
    "the major additional challenge that we face in this present work is the fact that the uniform distribution @xmath54 is not a product space , clause appearances are dependent , and it is unclear how to quantify this dependence . on the other hand , in the below - threshold regime ,",
    "since @xmath13 a random @xmath0-cnf formula is satisfiable , one can study random @xmath0-cnf formulas instead of satisfiable ones .",
    "this distribution , which we denoted above by @xmath9 , is very  close \" to a product space ( compare with the distribution where every clause is chosen independently at random with probability @xmath56 , which is already a product space ) .    one demonstration of this technical challenge is the difficulty of answering the following question : given a fixed assignment @xmath57 , what is the probability that it satisfies a random @xmath18 ? if @xmath18 is drawn from @xmath9 then the answer is simple , @xmath58 = ( 1 - 2^{-k})^m$ ] .",
    "if @xmath18 is drawn from @xmath54 then giving an explicit expression ( as a function of @xmath59 ) for @xmath58 $ ] is still an open question .",
    "we will show that for @xmath60 the expected number of pairs of satisfying assignments at distance @xmath55 from each other is much smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "since there are at most @xmath3 possible ways to choose @xmath62 , we can use the union bound to prove that @xmath13 @xmath18 has the desired properties ( since @xmath54 is the uniform distribution , showing that the property holds @xmath13 translates immediately to a deterministic statement about all but a vanishing fraction of satisfiable formulas ) .    to derive our estimate on the expected number of pairs of satisfying assignments at distance @xmath55",
    "we first analyze a different distribution which is commonly called the * planted distribution * , and we shall denote it by @xmath63 . to generate a formula according to @xmath63 , fix an assignment uniformly at random , then includes @xmath8 clauses uniformly at random out of @xmath64 clauses that are consistent with the `` planted '' assignment .",
    "when working with @xmath63 , the clauses are nearly independent and calculation is much easier .",
    "we then relate the planted model and the uniform model to obtain the desired result .",
    "the idea of translating bounds from the planted to the uniform model was used in @xcite for the below - threshold regime , and also in @xcite but in a different context .",
    "the reader may wonder at this point what happens when @xmath65 ?",
    "do typically all satisfying assignments lie in a low - diameter hamming ball all the way down to the satisfiability threshold ( or even below it ) ? numerical and rigorous ( tedious ) calculations that we did ,",
    "whose details we omit here , suggest that theorem [ thm : clusteringuniform ] can be extended ( maybe with some changes in the upper bound on @xmath20 ) down to @xmath66 ( which is an @xmath67-additive term from the satisfiability threshold ) .",
    "this extension is done using the same technique of going through the planted distribution . however , when @xmath68 this technique breaks . in section",
