    "multi - wavelength observations of accreting stellar - mass compact objects have revealed a fundamental coupling between the processes of accretion and ejection . as an x - ray binary ( xrb )",
    "evolves through a set of characteristic x - ray spectral and variability states over the course of an outburst , the radio emission , assumed to arise from jets launched from the inner regions of the system , is also seen to evolve .",
    "@xcite proposed a phenomenological model for this accretion - ejection ( disc - jet ) coupling in the relatively well - studied black hole ( bh ) xrbs . in this model ,",
    "compact steady jets are present in the hard x - ray spectral state , with the jet power scaling with x - ray luminosity .",
    "the jet velocity increases when the source makes a transition to a softer spectral state , leading to internal shocks within the flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observed as discrete knots of radio emission that move outwards at relativistic speeds .",
    "the compact jets then switch off .",
    "the system eventually makes a transition back to a hard spectral state , whereupon the core jets are re - established , and the source fades back into quiescence .",
    "this second state transition tends to occur at a lower luminosity than the original transition from the hard to the soft state , implying a hysteresis in the outburst cycle @xcite .",
    "compact jets are also inferred to exist in neutron star ( ns ) systems , from brightness temperature arguments , the observed flat - spectrum radio emission , and the detection of a jet break in broadband spectra @xcite",
    ". rapid energy transfer from the core to detached radio lobes @xcite also argues strongly for the existence of jets in ns systems , although their compact jets have not been directly imaged , as in bh systems @xcite . since ns xrbs are typically fainter radio emitters than their bh counterparts at the same x - ray luminosity @xcite , the nature of the disc - jet coupling in ns systems is consequently less well understood .",
    "@xcite made a systematic study of radio emission from ns xrbs , finding evidence for steady jets in hard state systems at low luminosities ( @xmath1% of the eddington luminosity , @xmath2 ) and transient jets in outbursting sources close to @xmath2 , as seen in bh systems but without complete suppression of the radio emission in soft states .",
    "the correlation between x - ray and radio emission in hard states was steeper in ns systems @xcite than the analogous correlation in bh systems @xcite , implying a different coupling between x - ray luminosity and mass accretion rate , although the jet power for a given accretion rate is similar in both classes of system @xcite .",
    "understanding the similarities and differences between the disc - jet coupling in bh and ns systems is crucial in determining the role played by the depth of the gravitational potential well , the stellar surface , and any stellar magnetic field in the process of jet formation .",
    "aql x-1 is a recurrent transient xrb which undergoes outbursts every @xmath3d .",
    "the accretor is a confirmed ns @xcite , in a @xmath4-h orbit @xcite with a k7v companion @xcite .",
    "its x - ray spectral and timing behavior classify it as an atoll source @xcite .",
    "the distance , determined from the luminosity of its type i x - ray bursts , is in the range 4.45.9kpc @xcite .    despite its frequent outbursts ,",
    "there are few reported radio detections of aql x-1 , likely owing to the faintness of atoll sources in the radio band @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed all publicly - available archival data from the very large array ( vla ) , taken exclusively during x - ray outbursts , between 1986 and 2005 .",
    "they detected the source at 11 epochs , with a maximum radio flux density of 0.4mjy .",
    "in all cases where multi - frequency observations were available , the radio spectrum was inverted ( @xmath5 , where flux density @xmath6 scales with frequency @xmath7 as @xmath8 ) .",
    "they also found tentative evidence for quenching of the radio emission above a certain x - ray luminosity .    here",
    ", we extend on the work of @xcite , presenting the most complete radio coverage of an outburst of aql x-1 obtained to date , to elucidate the nature of the radio / x - ray coupling in this source .",
    "rising x - ray flux from aql x-1 was observed on 2009 november 1 @xcite by the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rxte satellite during the ongoing galactic bulge monitoring program @xcite .",
    "here we present follow - up radio and x - ray data taken during the outburst .      on detection of rising x - ray flux , we triggered vla monitoring at 8.4ghz .",
    "data were taken in dual circular polarization with a total observing bandwidth of 100mhz .",
    "the array was in its least - extended d configuration .",
    "on detection of radio emission @xcite , we also began observing at 4.8ghz until the source faded below our detection threshold .",
    "further , we reduced all remaining unpublished archival vla data , covering the outbursts of 2006 august and 2007 october .",
    "data reduction was carried out according to standard procedures within aips @xcite .      following the initial vla radio detection , we triggered observations with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "we observed at 8.4ghz in dual circular polarization , using the maximum available recording rate of 512mbps , corresponding to an observing bandwidth of 64mhz per polarization .",
    "the observations , of duration 26h , were phase - referenced to the nearby calibrator j1907 + 0127 , from the third extension to the vlba calibrator survey ( vcs-3 ; * ? ? ? * ) and located @xmath9 from aql x-1 .",
    "the phase - referencing cycle time was 3min , with occasional scans on the vcs-4 @xcite check source j1920 - 0236 .",
    "for the longer observations , 30min at the start and end of the observing run were used to observe bright calibrator sources at differing elevations to calibrate unmodeled clock and tropospheric phase errors , thereby improving the success of the phase transfer .",
    "data reduction was carried out according to standard procedures within aips .      as reported by @xcite , aql x-1",
    "was observed at 5 ghz with the european vlbi network ( evn ) on 2009 november 19 ( 14:3019:00 ut ) using the e - vlbi technique . the array comprised stations at effelsberg , medicina , onsala , torun , westerbork , yebes and cambridge with a maximum recording rate of 1 gbps .",
    "we observed in full - polarization mode with a total bandwidth of 128 mhz per polarization , and data were phase referenced to j1907 + 0127 .",
    "the data were calibrated in aips and imaged in difmap @xcite using standard procedures .",
    "following @xcite , we used the 16-s time - resolution standard 2 mode pca data to calculate x - ray colors and intensities .",
    "hard and soft colors were defined as the count rate ratios ( 9.716.0  kev  /  6.09.7  kev ) and ( 3.56.0  kev  /  2.03.5  kev ) , respectively , and intensity was defined as the 2.016.0  kev count rate .",
    "type i x - ray bursts were removed , background was subtracted and deadtime corrections were made , before normalizing intensities and colors by those of the crab nebula , on a per - pcu basis .",
    "the observational results are given in table [ tab : obs ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] , together with the publicly available 210kev rxte asm and 1550kev swift bat lightcurves . the hard x - ray flux peaks",
    "first during the outburst , as noted by @xcite . as this starts to decrease , the soft flux rises and the x - ray colors decrease .",
    "radio emission is first detected at this point of x - ray spectral softening , with an 8.4 ghz flux density of @xmath10mjy ( the highest level measured to date from aql x-1 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray flux then levels off while the radio emission fades below detectable levels and the soft x - ray flux peaks at @xmath3mcrab before decaying . as the x - ray color increases again and the spectrum hardens",
    ", a second burst of radio emission is detected .",
    "thus while the radio sampling is relatively sparse during the second state transition , the radio emission is consistent with being triggered at transitions in both directions between the hard and the soft x - ray states .      during the x - ray spectral softening",
    ", the source was detected for the first time with vlbi .",
    "the 5-ghz evn observations were not fully consistent with an unresolved source , showing tentative evidence for a marginal - significance ( @xmath11 , @xmath12mjy ) extension to the southeast ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "the 8.4-ghz vlba observations made on the same day were consistent with an unresolved source , to a noise level of 0.046mjybeam@xmath13 , and implied a slightly inverted core radio spectrum ( @xmath14 ) . within uncertainties ,",
    "the vlbi flux density was consistent at both frequencies with the integrated vla flux density measured the previous day , so the majority of the flux was recovered on milliarcsecond scales .",
    "however , faint extended emission at the level seen by the evn can not be fully discounted , since convolving the 8.4-ghz vlba data to the 5-ghz evn resolution raised the noise level too high to detect such emission .",
    "simulations demonstrated that the longer baselines of the vlba would not detect faint extended emission as seen by the evn on a size scale of 10mas unless it were significantly more compact than the evn beamsize .",
    "this allows for the possibility that the emission is sufficiently faint and extended to be resolved out by the vlba ( possibly indicative of a large - scale , steady jet ) , but makes it unlikely to be caused by compact , localized internal shocks .",
    "alternatively , the extension in the evn image may not in fact be real .",
    "the vlba position of aql x-1 , relative to the vcs-3 phase reference source j1907 + 0127 , whose position was taken to be ( j2000 ) 19@xmath1507@xmath16119962510(747 ) 0127@xmath170896251(135 ) , was @xmath18 where the quoted error bars are purely statistical errors from fitting in the image plane .",
    "imaging the check source j1920 - 0236 , phase referenced to j1907 + 0127 , suggested that the systematic errors are well below 1mas .",
    "this vlba position is also consistent within errors with the evn position .",
    "the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) is a diagnostic plot used extensively in interpreting the x - ray evolution of bh xrb outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the 2000 september outburst of aql x-1 traced out a very similar hysteresis loop in a hid to the better - studied bh candidates .",
    "[ fig : hid ] shows the radio emission superposed on the hids for both the 2009 november outburst of aql x-1 and previous outbursts , showing the relation between radio emission and the x - ray spectral state of the source .",
    "the radio emission is consistent with being triggered at x - ray state transitions , switching on as the source moves into the intermediate ( island ) state in the color - color diagram ( ccd ; fig .",
    "[ fig : hid ] ) , from either the hard ( extreme island ) or soft ( banana ) state .",
    "this pattern of triggering radio emission at state transitions is similar to the behavior seen in both the atoll source 4u1728 - 34 @xcite and in bh xrb outbursts @xcite .",
    "however , unlike in bh systems , we did not detect radio emission in the rising hard state ( the right hand side of the hid ) , possibly due to insufficient sensitivity ( our upper limits are close to the predicted values from the correlation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nor did we detect optically - thin shocked ejecta after the transition to the soft state .",
    "the radio emission appears quenched while the system is in a high - luminosity soft ( banana ) state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rxcorr ] ) . @xcite and @xcite also found evidence for the quenching of the jets in ns systems above a critical x - ray luminosity , albeit on the basis of relatively sparse observational data ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for counterexamples ) . from figures  [ fig : hid ] and [ fig : rxcorr ] ,",
    "the critical luminosity for aql x-1 appears to be @xmath19 crab , corresponding to a 216kev luminosity of @xmath20ergs@xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath21 for a @xmath22 neutron star accretor . while reminiscent of the drop in radio flux seen in bh systems at a few per cent of @xmath2 @xcite , higher - sensitivity observations are required to accurately determine the critical luminosity .",
    "the brightness temperature ( @xmath23 ) of the unresolved vlba source is @xmath24k .",
    "the maximum vla flux density of 0.68mjy implies a source with @xmath25 au . even at the inverse compton limit of @xmath26k",
    ", the emission would arise on scales greater than the roche lobe around the ns , which strongly suggests that the emitting material is flowing away from the system .",
    "the two epochs with constraints on the radio spectrum are consistent with flat or slightly - inverted spectra , typically interpreted in bh xrbs as arising from partially self - absorbed compact jets @xcite .",
    "reduction of archival vla data ( table [ tab : obs ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that every dual - frequency detection of the source to date is consistent with a flat or inverted radio spectrum , albeit with fairly large error bars . reducing the error bars by taking a weighted mean of all spectral indices taken outside the hard ( extreme island ) x - ray state ( in which , by analogy with bh",
    ", a flat spectrum is expected ) gives @xmath27 .",
    "such a flat spectrum is also consistent with the lack of optically - thin ejecta in the vlbi observations , and with the recovery of the full integrated vla flux with the vlba and evn .",
    "we thus find no evidence for transient , optically thin jet emission as seen in bh xrb outbursts .",
    "if confirmed by future observations , the marginal evn extension would imply a jet of size @xmath0mas ( @xmath28au ) . if not , the vlba beamsize of @xmath29mas@xmath30 gives an upper limit on the physical size scale of the jets of @xmath31au at 8.4ghz .",
    "such a small size is consistent with the low flux density , when compared to the case of cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "only two ns xrbs , sco x-1 and cir x-1 , have previously been imaged on vlbi scales .",
    "@xcite detected resolved radio lobes in sco x-1 , which moved out from the central source at speeds of 0.30.6@xmath32 . rather than being internal shocks within a jet ,",
    "these were interpreted as the working surfaces where the jets impacted the surrounding environment . from the time delay between corresponding flaring events in the core and these hotspots",
    ", it was inferred that an unseen beam transferred energy between the core and the lobes at a velocity @xmath33 .",
    "limits on the jet size in cir x-1 were derived by @xcite and @xcite , and although scatter - broadened , it was speculated that a compact jet of size 35mas ( @xmath34au ) might be present in the system .",
    "while sco x-1 is a z - source , cir x-1 shows characteristics of both atoll and z - sources @xcite , and aql x-1 is an atoll source , none of them show clear evidence for internal shocks propagating down the jets at relativistic speeds and giving rise to discrete radio knots , as seen in bh outbursts . while approximate mass scalings would suggest that optically - thin ns jets should be less bright than those in bh , they should be detectable , albeit on smaller scales .",
    "thus the mechanism responsible for generating internal shocks ( variations in the jet lorentz factor are often invoked ) is either less effective in ns xrbs than in their bh counterparts , or the shocks are less efficient emitters .",
    "possible explanations include a less variable or more smoothly varying outflow speed ( although ns jets can produce ultrarelativistic outflows ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a high sound speed ( although with a maximum of @xmath35 , this appears unlikely if all ns jets are highly relativistic ) , or a high magnetic field to smooth out variations in the flow ( possible , given the existing stellar field ) .",
    "more speculatively , should the discrete knots be ballistic ejecta launched from magnetic fields threading the ergosphere @xcite , rather than internal shocks , this mechanism would not be present in ns systems .",
    "disk fields @xcite would then be the best candidate for accelerating the ns and hard state bh jets , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "further sensitive , high - resolution radio observations of ns sources in outburst are required to confirm this lack of transient ejecta and ascertain whether this is indeed a fundamental difference between ns and bh jets .",
    "similarities and differences between the two classes of source will constrain the role of the stellar surface and magnetic field and the depth of the potential well in accelerating relativistic jets from accreting compact objects .",
    "we have obtained unprecedented radio coverage of an outburst of the ns xrb aql x-1 , demonstrating that the radio emission is consistent with being activated by both transitions from a hard state to a soft state and by the reverse transition at lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "our data appear to confirm previous suggestions of quenched radio emission above a certain x - ray luminosity , corresponding to @xmath0% of the eddington luminosity .",
    "we have for the first time detected the source with vlbi , which together with the measured brightness temperature , radio spectra and integrated flux density observed by the vla demonstrates that the radio emission in this source is consistent with the compact , partially self - absorbed steady jets seen in the hard states of bh xrbs .",
    "nss thus appear equally capable of launching jets as bhs , but the absence of bright , optically thin , relativistically moving knots may suggest a fundamental difference in the jet formation process between ns and bh systems , possibly hinting at an additional role from the ergosphere .",

    "<S> the 2009 november outburst of the neutron star x - ray binary aquila x-1 was observed with unprecedented radio coverage and simultaneous pointed x - ray observations , tracing the radio emission around the full x - ray hysteresis loop of the outburst for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we use these data to discuss the disc - jet coupling , finding the radio emission to be consistent with being triggered at state transitions , both from the hard to the soft spectral state and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> our data appear to confirm previous suggestions of radio quenching in the soft state above a threshold x - ray luminosity of @xmath0% of the eddington luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the first detections of aql x-1 with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , showing that any extended emission is relatively diffuse , and consistent with steady jets rather than arising from discrete , compact knots . in all cases where multi - frequency data were available , </S>",
    "<S> the source radio spectrum is consistent with being flat or slightly inverted , suggesting that the internal shock mechanism that is believed to produce optically thin transient radio ejecta in black hole x - ray binaries is not active in aql x-1 . </S>"
