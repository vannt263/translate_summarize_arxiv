    "the field of quantum imaging studies the spatial distribution of the quantum correlations in optical fields  @xcite .",
    "it offers the possibility of improving the resolution of an imaging system  @xcite , enhancing image detection  @xcite or beam positioning  @xcite , and implementing parallel quantum information encoding  @xcite and processing  @xcite .",
    "an important goal of quantum imaging is to use the multi - spatial - mode properties of quantum fields to extend the enhancement in sensitivity that can be obtained with quantum states from the temporal  @xcite to the spatial domain . in this paper",
    "we propose a scheme that achieves this goal .",
    "in particular , we show that it is possible to take advantage of spatial quantum correlations between two entangled beams to extract information about the shape of a mask in the path of one of the beams .",
    "we consider a configuration based on noise measurements and homodyne detection .",
    "as we are not extracting information from the mean field values , this technique becomes useful when the number of photons that is used to interrogate the mask is in the regime where it is low enough that it can not be readily detected with a photodiode , but high enough that photon counting is not an option .",
    "even though in this regime the mask is interrogated by a small number of photons , the use of homodyne detection makes it possible to perform the measurement .",
    "we analyze whether or not there is an advantage in the use of quantum states over classical ones with equivalent properties ( mean photon flux and single beam noise ) , and find that under some conditions an enhancement of the sensitivity in the estimation of the shape of the mask can be obtained with the quantum states .",
    "we show that the enhancement that is obtained is a result of the quantum correlations and can not be explained with only classical correlations .",
    "finally , we find that the level of enhancement increases with the number of spatial modes in the field probing the mask .",
    "the possibility of extracting spatial information about a mask from noise measurements of a beam that passes through it results from the fact that in homodyne detection the shape of the local oscillator ( lo ) effectively acts as a spatial filter that selects out the portion of the field to be measured  @xcite .",
    "that is , the spatial overlap between the beam that goes through the mask and the lo affects the efficiency of the measurement .",
    "since the beam acquires the shape of the mask after going through it , we can change the shape of the lo when performing the homodyne detection to optimize the measured noise level and thus estimate the overlap .",
    "once the optimization criterion is met , the shape of the mask can be deduced from the shape of the lo . in practice , as a result of the type of measurement being done , this problem reduces to one of parameter estimation . for this particular problem",
    "the quantity to estimate is the overlap or mode matching between the lo and the beam that goes through the mask .    the basic configuration for such a scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ configuration ] . entangled twin beams",
    "are used to probe the mask whose shape we want to estimate .",
    "one of the beams goes through the mask and is then detected with a homodyne detector while the other one is directly sent to a second homodyne detector .",
    "the noise in the difference signal of the detectors is used to estimate the overlap and thus extract information about the shape of the mask .",
    "when the entangled beams that are used contain multiple spatial modes they also contain spatial quantum correlations which are characterized by a coherence area  @xcite that sets the spatial extent of the smallest correlated areas between the two beams .",
    "if the beam contains multiple coherence areas , and the size of these coherence areas is smaller than the size of the mask , then the sensitivity in the estimation can be enhanced . since a coherence area in one beam",
    "is only correlated with a single corresponding coherence area in the other beam  @xcite , it is important that the los of the two homodyne detectors select out or measure the corresponding correlated regions in the two beams .        in order to implement this scheme one would like to perform a series of noise measurements with a dynamically changing lo .",
    "this could be done by using spatial light modulators to control the spatial profile of the los for beams @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the shape of the los would be modified until the noise level is optimized , at which point the overlap between the lo of beam @xmath0 and the field that went through the mask is also optimized .",
    "this implies that the shape of the lo of beam @xmath0 corresponds to the one of the field that went through the mask and makes it possible to infer the shape of the mask from the final shape of this lo .",
    "this strategy is reminiscent of ghost imaging  @xcite , in which the goal is to image an object without it being in the path of an imaging camera or detector . in ghost imaging the two beams that are used",
    "are composed of streams of correlated photon pairs .",
    "the object is placed in the path of one of the beams , which is then detected by a non - imaging , or `` bucket '' , detector , which alone reveals no information about the shape of the object .",
    "the beam that does not go through the mask is sent directly to a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera or scanning point detector .",
    "correlations between the arrival of photons on the detectors can then be used to reconstruct the object .",
    "even though originally it was believed that spatial quantum correlations were required for ghost imaging  @xcite , it was later realized that classical correlations could also be used for the same purpose  @xcite .",
    "as we will show here , there are two main differences between the scheme proposed here and ghost imaging .",
    "the first is that , with the proposed configuration , information about the object can be obtained directly from measurements of only the beam that goes through the mask .",
    "the second , and most important one , is that the use of quantum correlations between the beams can lead to an enhancement of the sensitivity in the estimation of the shape of the object over a classical state with equivalent properties , and that this enhancement can not be explained assuming only classical correlations .",
    "we compare the two - beam strategy presented in fig .",
    "[ configuration ] with two analogous classically obtainable configurations . in the first one we consider a single beam scheme in which the beam that goes through the mask shares the same photon flux and mode structure as the entangled beams in the two - beam strategy . after going through the mask the beam",
    "is sent to a homodyne detector .",
    "the resulting noise measurements are then used to estimate the shape of the mask . throughout the paper",
    "we refer to this scheme as the single - beam strategy . in the second configuration",
    "we duplicate the two - beam strategy using classically correlated beams also sharing the same photon flux and mode structure as above .",
    "in order to analyze both the two - beam and single - beam strategies described above we need to take into account the multi - spatial - mode nature of the fields , even for the case in which only one of the spatial modes is not in a vacuum state . this can be done by expanding the field operators in terms of a complete set of spatial mode functions  @xcite , such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an orthonormal and complete basis , @xmath4 refers to the transverse variables of the field , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the destruction operators for spatial mode @xmath7 for beams @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the state of the different spatial modes within each beam are not quantum correlated , such that the state of the field can be written as  @xcite @xmath8 where the first @xmath9 spatial modes of the field are excited with a wave function @xmath10 for spatial mode @xmath7 and the rest of the modes are in a vacuum state .",
    "when more than one spatial mode is excited ( @xmath11 ) the field is considered a multi - spatial - mode field .",
    "the goal of the scheme described here is to estimate the field transfer function of the mask , which is taken to be of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the intensity transfer function and @xmath14 is the phase that a field would acquire after going through the mask and allows for the possibility of a phase mask .",
    "we can take into account the spatially dependent loss introduced by the mask by treating its effect on the field operator in the usual way .",
    "that is , the field operators are transformed according to @xmath15\\\\      { \\hat{b}_{out}}({\\vec{x}})&=&{\\hat{b}_{in}}({\\vec{x}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the corresponding operator for the vacuum field that results from losses .",
    "note that in writing these expressions we have assumed that beam @xmath0 is the one that goes through the mask while beam @xmath1 has no losses .    as described above",
    ", we are interested in obtaining information about the transfer function of the mask through noise measurements of the signal that is obtained with balanced homodyne detection .",
    "as is typically done with this type of detection , we assume the lo to be a classical field , such that the measured signal after beam @xmath0 goes through the mask is given by @xmath17      \\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\int d{\\vec{x}}\\left[e^{-i\\phi({\\vec{x}})}\\sqrt{t({\\vec{x}})}\\alpha_{lo}({\\vec{x}}){\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{in}}({\\vec{x}})\\right.\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\left.+e^{-i\\phi({\\vec{x}})}\\sqrt{1-t({\\vec{x}})}\\alpha_{lo}({\\vec{x}}){\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{v}}({\\vec{x}})+\\rm{h.c.}\\right ] ,      \\label{homodyne}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral is over the transverse profile of the fields , h.c .",
    "indicates the hermitian conjugate , and @xmath18 is the spatial field profile of the lo .",
    "similarly , for beam @xmath1 the measured signal is of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ homodyne ] ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in order to simplify eq .",
    "( [ homodyne ] ) we use the mode expansion for the operators , eq .",

    "in particular , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the field overlap and relative phase between the lo , had it gone through the mask , and basis mode @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath25 contains information about the shape of the lo and the amplitude transfer function of the mask , while @xmath26 contains information about the phase difference between the phase of the lo and any phase introduced by the mask .",
    "these expansions together with the orthonormality property of the basis allow us to simplify @xmath27 to the form @xmath28 ,      \\label{homodynesuma}\\ ] ] where we have defined the generalized field quadrature for beam @xmath0 before the mask , @xmath29 .",
    "the subindex @xmath30 indicates that for those modes the field is in the vacuum state .    in the same way we can simplify the expression for the measured signal for beam @xmath1 by expanding the lo for beam @xmath1 in terms of the basis modes @xmath3 , that is @xmath31 where we have assumed the lo for beam @xmath1 has the same amplitude @xmath22 as the one for beam @xmath0 . in this expression @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "are the field overlap and relative phase between the lo and basis mode @xmath7 .",
    "note that we have defined the amplitude of the lo such that @xmath34 .",
    "we can now simplify @xmath35 to the form @xmath36 where we have introduced the generalized field quadrature for the different spatial modes of beam @xmath1 .",
    "we start by analyzing the two - beam strategy presented in fig .",
    "[ configuration ] . in this case entangled twin beams are used to estimate the shape of the mask . for this strategy ,",
    "the signal to be measured is the noise in the difference signal , which is given by @xmath37 where the @xmath9 subindex indicates that the variance or noise is normalized to the corresponding standard quantum limit ( sql ) and the @xmath38 subindex indicates the two - beam strategy .",
    "given that beam @xmath0 goes through the mask while beam @xmath1 sees no losses , we find with the help of eqs .",

    "since we are only interested in the variance or noise of the signal , we can assume without loss of generality that the mean values for the quadratures of the field are zero , such that @xmath40 in addition , the situation when the mean value is zero is where the scheme described here becomes more useful , as information about the mask can only be obtained through noise measurements . with these expressions and the assumption that the different spatial modes in each beam are not quantum correlated , we can show that the normalized noise in the difference signal is given by @xmath41 ,      \\label{mtb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the relation @xmath42 and have normalized the noise to the sql for beams @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that is , we divide by @xmath43 .      in order to consider the configuration in which only classical resources are used , we analyze the single - beam strategy . in this case",
    "only the beam that goes through the mask is detected and the signal to be measured is the normalized noise of that beam . the measured signal for this strategy can be obtained from the one of the two - beam strategy , eq .",
    "( [ mtb ] ) , by setting @xmath44 and taking into account that for the single - beam strategy the normalization factor ( the sql ) is given by @xmath45 instead of @xmath43 .",
    "we thus have that @xmath46 + 1 ,      \\label{msb}\\ ] ] where we have again assumed @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to note a coherent state can not be used with this strategy to extract information about the transfer function of the mask , as the summation in eq .",
    "( [ msb ] ) vanishes since a coherent state always has @xmath48 . as a result , @xmath49 and",
    "no information can be obtained about the coefficients @xmath25 and thus about the shape of the mask .",
    "this is also the case for the two - beam strategy .",
    "the reason that a coherent state is not useful is because it has the same noise level as a vacuum state . as a result ,",
    "the vacuum noise contribution that is introduced by the losses due to the mask will not change the noise level of the field after it goes through the mask .",
    "thus , this strategy requires a state whose noise level is initially different from that of a coherent state .",
    "this is an important point since for this problem a coherent state does not provide a classical limit , as is usually the case with other estimation techniques .      as described above ,",
    "the problem being considered reduces to one of parameter estimation . in particular , the parameter to estimate is the overlap between the lo and the beam that goes through the mask .",
    "we can parameterize the noise of the signal that is measured with homodyne detection in terms of the transmission of the lo that one would obtain if it had gone through the mask instead , and make it the parameter to estimate .",
    "the transmission of the lo through the mask is then given by @xmath50 where the integral is over the transverse profile of the lo .",
    "in obtaining this result we have used eq .",
    "( [ funmodeexpansion ] ) to express @xmath51 in terms of @xmath25 .    for a general mask transfer function",
    "for which different transmission levels are possible , one would have to implement a different protocol in which a series of measurements is performed .",
    "for example , one could use a series of los with different shapes , such as the basis modes , in order to extract enough information to estimate the transfer function of the mask .",
    "this would make it possible to extract all the values of @xmath25 . once all these values are known and the input state is completely characterized it would be possible to reconstruct the complete transfer function of the mask .",
    "for the case of a phase mask , information about the phase of the transfer function is contained in the phase factor of the expansion coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ funmodeexpansion ] ) , that is @xmath26 . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ mtb ] ) and  ( [ msb ] ) this phase factor appears in the generalized quadrature and selects the quadrature that is measured . for a phase sensitive state",
    "in which the noise properties depend on the phase being measured , one can modify the phase front of the lo for beam @xmath0 in such a way as to minimize or maximize the noise .",
    "once this is done the phase of the transfer function of the mask can be extracted from the phase front of the lo .",
    "for the two - beam strategy , which requires a lo for each beam , independent control of the phase front of each lo would be required , as the lo for beam @xmath0 will have to compensate for the additional phase that the beam acquires after going through the mask .",
    "it should be noted that a phase insensitive state can not be used to obtain information about a phase mask , as the measured noise will be independent of @xmath26 and thus will not provide information about the phase of the transfer function .    for the protocol",
    "as described here to work we require the intensity transfer function of the mask at each position @xmath4 to have a transmission of either zero or one .",
    "we assume that the area of the lo is the same as the one of the mask for @xmath52 .",
    "we also assume that the noise signal that is used for the estimation , @xmath53 or @xmath54 , either grows or decreases as the transmission @xmath51 increases , such that a maximum or minimum is obtained when @xmath52 .",
    "under these conditions once the noise level is optimized we know that the lo and the field that went through the mask have the same shape .",
    "thus , one can then obtain the intensity transfer function of the mask from the shape of the lo .    as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ mtb ] ) and  ( [ msb ] ) only spatial modes with a noise level different than the one of a coherent state contribute to the measurement . as a result ,",
    "even if only one spatial mode is not in a vacuum state , it is possible to obtain information about the transfer function of the mask .",
    "this means that a multi - spatial - mode field is not required for the estimation . a single - mode field , however , is in general not detected with unit efficiency ( @xmath55 ) when the lo has the same shape as the mask and @xmath52 . for an arbitrary mask ,",
    "when the lo matches its shape , the expansion of the lo in terms of the basis modes requires more than a single mode . as we will show later",
    ", this reduction in efficiency will tend to lead to a reduction in the accuracy or sensitivity of the estimation of @xmath51 and having multiple spatial modes will make it possible to obtain a more accurate estimate of @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to study the sensitivity that can be achieved in the estimation of the transmission @xmath51 . in general , the uncertainty in estimating parameter @xmath56 through measurements of quantity @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 which takes into account the slope of the measured signal with respect to the parameter being estimated and the noise on the measurement .",
    "as this uncertainty is reduced , the sensitivity of the estimation is increased , thus making it possible to obtain a better estimate for @xmath56 .",
    "we now calculate the sensitivity for both strategies described above in the estimation of @xmath51 .      to determine the sensitivity of this strategy we need to calculate the noise of @xmath53 , which means that we need the variance of the difference noise signal , that is @xmath59 to simplify this expression we assume that the fields that are used have gaussian statistics , which means that higher order moments can be expressed in terms of first and second order moments  @xcite . in particular , this implies that for the quadrature of each mode @xmath60 using this property we find that eq .",

    "the functional form of these results will change for each configuration and , in general , a numerical analysis would be required to compare the two strategies .    in order to compare the two strategies we consider the limit in which all the spatial modes have the same noise properties , that is , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",

    "that is , the presence of only classical correlations in the two - beam strategy does not make it possible to obtain an enhancement in sensitivity over the classical single - beam strategy and in fact , in general , it leads to a decrease in sensitivity .",
    "this result shows that quantum correlations are needed in order to obtain the enhancement in sensitivity .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to use noise measurements to estimate the transfer function of a mask in the path of an optical beam . for this purpose",

    "we have shown that an enhancement can be obtained with the use of quantum states over classical ones .",
    "this enhancement is a result of the quantum correlations present between the two beams and can not be explained through the presence of only classical correlations .",
    "even though a multi - spatial - mode field is not required for the estimation of the transfer function in either the two - beam or single - beam configurations , we have shown that the presence of multiple spatial modes can increase the enhancement in sensitivity that is obtained with the quantum states .",
    "in addition , the level of enhancement increases with the level of entanglement or squeezing between the twin beams used for the estimation .",
    "although we have limited the analysis to the case of a mask with a transmission value at a given point of either zero or one , we have shown that it is possible to extend the analysis presented to obtain information about a phase mask and to treat the case of soft apertures .",
