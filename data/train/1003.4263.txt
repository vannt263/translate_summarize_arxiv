    "radio sources are frequently associated with massive systems at low and high redshifts . in the local universe these objects are usually identified with evolved red ellipticals and with luminous cd galaxies located at the centres of clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "radio sources at high redshifts ( @xmath5 ) are identified with massive forming systems , i.e galaxies with diffuse uv morphologies and consistent with small substructures around a dominant bright galaxy @xcite .",
    "several works show that some distant radio sources are embedded in highly spatially extended ionized gas nebulae of 100 - 200 kpc @xcite .",
    "these gas structures are observed in massive ellipticals or cd galaxies at the center of nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "this evidence suggests that distant radio sources represent the progenitors of the most massive galaxies observed in the local universe and therefore important for the study of structure formation , such as clusters or groups of galaxies .",
    "a high fraction of radio sources associated with clusters of galaxies have steep radio spectra as measured by the slope between two fixed ranges of frequencies , i.e the spectral index @xmath6 ( uss , @xmath1 , where @xmath7 , @xcite ) . such a correlations between spectral index and redshift ( @xmath0 relation ) , has been used with success to search for distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are at least three main explanations given in the literature for this phenomenon : the first is a radio k - correction .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of radio sources is usually concave , i.e the spectral index increases with frequency .",
    "the observed spectral index determined from two fixed observed frequencies will therefore sample a steeper part of the radio spectrum for sources at higher redshifts .",
    "the second is related with the interaction between photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and the relativistic electron population observed in the plasma gas of radio sources .",
    "the energy density of the cmb increases as @xmath8 and hence inverse compton scattering ( ic ) of the cmb becomes increasingly important for sources at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the third is related to an intrinsic correlation between radio luminosity and _ rest - frame _ spectral index @xcite that due to a malmquist like bias in flux density limited surveys translates into a correlation between spectral index and redshift .",
    "an alternative explanation is related with an ambient density effect .",
    "the presence of uss radio sources residing closest to cluster centres may be due to a manifestation of pressure - confined radio lobes which slow adiabatic expansion of the plasma .",
    "radio lobes will be pressure - confined and lose energy primarily via synchrotron and ic losses @xcite .",
    "studies of radio sources at low and moderate redshifts ( @xmath9 ) show different environments .",
    "hill & lilly ( 1991 ) find that only 50% of powerful radio sources at @xmath10 are located in rich galaxy clusters , even though similar sources avoid such environments at low redshifts .",
    "however , geach et al . ( 2007 ) analyzed radio sources in the subaru / xmm - newton deep field and found that low - power radio galaxies at @xmath10 reside in moderately rich groups - intermediate environments between poor groups and rich clusters .",
    "@xcite investigate the local galaxy density around powerful radio sources using the angular cross - correlation technique and find that compact radio sources appear to lie in regions of low galaxy density .",
    "moreover , that complex fanaroff - riley class i sources are typically found in regions of significantly enhanced galaxy density .",
    "@xcite study the evolution of galaxies in radio - selected groups at @xmath11 with the same range of radio power and find that strong radio galaxies are located in a wide range of environments but not as wide as for groups in general . at low redshifts ( @xmath12 ) radio - selected groups",
    "have the same richness and blue fraction as do optically - selected groups . at high redshifts ( @xmath13 )",
    "all groups have the same proportion of blue galaxies .",
    "studying the prevalence of radio loud agn activity in nearby groups and galaxy clusters , selected from the sdss catalog , @xcite find that brightest group and cluster galaxies are more likely to host a radio loud agn than other galaxies of the same stellar mass .    in this work",
    "we analyze optical and radio properties of radio sources with steep radio spectra , and we determine the main characteristics of clusters of galaxies associated with radio sources .    the structure of this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the optical and radio samples analyzed .",
    "we analyze radio spectral properties of our sample in section 3 .",
    "section 4 compares the optical and the radio luminosities of sources associated with steep spectrum and central galaxy clusters . in section 5 , we study the hubble diagram in the optical @xmath3 band for uss sources .",
    "we study in section 6 spectral index and richness properties of galaxies associated with clusters of galaxies and finally , in section 7 , we discuss our main results .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a standard @xmath14cdm model universe with cosmological parameters , @xmath15=0.3 , @xmath16=0.7 and a hubble constant of @xmath17100  h  km  s@xmath18mpc@xmath18 .",
    "the sample of radio sources was selected from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "this catalogue presents information in radio and optical bands taken from several surveys , including faint images of the radio sky survey ( first , 1400 mhz ) , nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , 1400 mhz ) , westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss , 325 mhz ) , green bank survey ( gb6 , 4850 mhz ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) optical survey .",
    "the flux density limits for each radio catalogue are 1 , 2.5 , 18 and 18 mjy for the first , nvss , gb and wenss surveys , respectively .",
    "the sdss catalogue contains flux densities of detected objects measured nearly simultaneously in u , g , r , i , and z optical bands ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) with a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 in an area of @xmath20 square degrees in the north galactic cap and a small region of 225 square degrees in the south galactic cap .",
    "the sample of optical galaxies in the fields of radio sources were selected using the catalog archive server jobs system ( casjobs ) interface of sdss , which allows one to obtain catalogues with parameters from the sdss survey ( dr6 ) ..    the matching radius to correlate the radio ( first ) and optical ( sdss ) surveys was 2@xmath21 .",
    "we chose this matching radius in order to avoid contamination by line of sight matches of physical unrelated objects , since @xcite previously found an efficiency ( fraction of matches which are physically real ) of 95% and completeness ( fraction of real matches that were found ) of 98% with this matching radius . in this work we used the following catalogue subsets : sample d ( detected by first , nvss and wenss survey , with 63,660 sources ) , sample e ( detected by first , nvss , wenss , gb6 and the sdss survey , 4732 sources ) and sample g ( detected by first , nvss , wenss and the sdss spectroscopic survey , 2885 sources ) .",
    "for all these samples @xcite estimated matching efficiencies of @xmath22% and completeness limits of @xmath23% , using an appropriate matching radius .    a more detailed description of the radio sample and the criteria used to merge catalogues can be found in @xcite .",
    "our sample of tracer galaxies for this work are drawn from the catalogue of galaxies with photometric redshifts of the dr6 catalogue @xcite .",

    "<S> the sample of radio sources are selected from the catalogue of kimball & ivezi ( 2008 ) with flux densities at 325 , 1400 and 4850 mhz , using wenss , nvss and gb6 radio surveys and from flux measurements at 74 mhz taken from vla low - frequency sky survey @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study radiogalaxy spectral properties using radio colour - colour diagrams and find that our sample follows a single power law from 74 to 4850 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index vs. spectroscopic redshift relation ( @xmath0 ) is not significant for our sample of radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a subsample of radio sources associated with clusters of galaxies identified from the maxbcg catalogue and find that about 40% of radio sources with ultra steep spectra ( uss , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ) are associated with galaxy clusters or groups of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a hubble diagram of uss radio sources in the optical @xmath3 band up to @xmath4.8 and compare our results with those for normal galaxies selected from different optical surveys and find that uss radio sources are around as luminous as the central galaxies in the maxbcg cluster sample and typically more than 4 magnitudes brighter than normal galaxies at @xmath4.3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we study correlations between spectral index , richness and luminosity of clusters associated with radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that uss at low redshift are rare , most of them reside in regions of unusually high ambient density , such of those found in rich cluster of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest that clusters of galaxies associated with steeper than the average spectra have higher richness counts and are populated by luminous galaxies in comparison with those environments associated to radio sources with flatter than the average spectra . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible explanation for our results is that radio emission is more pressure confined in higher gas density environments such as those found in rich clusters of galaxies and as a consequence radio lobes in rich galaxy clusters will expand adiabatically and lose energy via synchrotron and inverse compton losses , resulting in a steeper radio spectra .    </S>",
