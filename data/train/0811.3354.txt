    "the most popular approximation is the elastic scattering approach , despite the fact that it can not compensate the electron acceleration due to the applied electric field .",
    "it can only be compensated by a momentum dissipation , which can ensure that the total force acting on electrons vanishes in the steady state .",
    "another possibility is to analyze forces acting on electrons in the transport regime .",
    "the condition of the vanishing total force is the basic physical condition for the steady state .",
    "the application of the linear response approach , limiting the problem to the case of small deviation from the equilibrium , gives the transport coefficients satisfying the steady state condition .",
    "this idea will be used to determine the hall resistance of a system of bloch spinless electrons in the case of a weak magnetic field . for the sake of simplicity we limit our consideration to isotropic systems where the energy spectrum is represented by a single electron band .",
    "it can be expected that in this case the hall resistance will not depend on the dissipation explicitly , which can simplify the analysis substantially .",
    "the hall resistance is standardly measured on the so - called hall bar samples , having the form of a long strip .",
    "far from the contacts the current density is parallel to the strip edges , say along @xmath0-direction .",
    "if the magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the strip surface , along @xmath1-direction , the current induced lorentz force is shifting the electron charge distribution . as the result",
    "there appears a non - equilibrium charge distribution giving rise the hall voltage .",
    "the steady state requires the compensation of the lorentz force by the gradient force . for isotropic systems",
    "this condition can be written in the following form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current density , @xmath4 denotes the background potential including that given by the electric field along @xmath5 direction , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 stands for electro - chemical potential .",
    "angular brackets represent quantum - mechanical and statistical average .",
    "the internal pressure @xmath8 represents the force of the electron ensemble acting on the external system per unit area .",
    "linear response approximation with respect to the electro - chemical potential gradient leads to the following expression for the hall resistance @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the applied current through the strip of thickness @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the voltage drop between strip edges .    the gradient force and consequently the pressure are quantities which are generally dependent on the magnetic field strength @xmath13 . in the weak field",
    "limit the hall resistance can be supposed a linear function of @xmath13 which implies that the @xmath13-dependent internal pressure can be replaced by its zero field limit . for a free electron gas ( resp .",
    "hole gas ) it can be identified with the so - called statistical pressure , and its derivative with respect to @xmath7 is simply equal to the electron concentration @xmath14 ( resp . to the negative value of the hole concentration ) @xcite . considering a single electron band",
    "the hall resistance for chemical potentials in the vicinity of band edges is thus quite well understood .",
    "since it has opposite signs at opposite band edges it should vanish at the band center . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only published work in which the transition between electron to hole like character of the hall resistance has been described was based on the application of the kubo formula for the special case of substitutional alloys  @xcite .",
    "however , no procedure based on force analysis has been presented .",
    "a previous publication  @xcite made by one of us was unfortunately based on incorrect application of the quasi - classical approach as will be specified later .    in crystalline solids",

    "it is periodic in real space , having translation symmetry given by the lattice periodicity .",
    "non - zero current density gives rise to the lorentz force inducing a shift of the mass - center positions .",
    "this shift has to be compensated by the gradient force trying to return it back into the equilibrium distribution .",
    "the results generally depend on the experimental set up , particularly the way how the non - zero current density is induced .    in the regime we will call as fully dissipative , the current is supposed to be exclusively given by the electric field @xmath15 along strip axis . in other words , if @xmath16 the current vanishes .",
    "this assumption requires that dissipation take place within the strip , i.e. that the system can be viewed as a macroscopic system .",
    "it can be expected that this fully dissipative regime represents the conditions of the standardly measured hall resistance in the weak field limit for which it can be assumed that the effect of the magnetic field to the energy spectrum is negligible .",
    "the opposite limiting case is the purely non - dissipative regime for which the current density is exclusively determined by the electric field @xmath6 across the strip , while @xmath17 .",
    "such a situation is observed whenever the fermi energy is located within the conduction gaps , i.e. when the magnetic field is strong enough to induce energy gaps giving rise to a hofstadter type spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has already been shown that in such a quantum hall regime the induced hall current is closely related to the static electron polarizability @xcite .",
    "the non - dissipative regime , for which the hall current is exclusively determined by the orbital magnetization , can be in principle induced even if the fermi energy is located within the energy band .",
    "this regime , in the considered weak field limit , will also be analyzed , although the resulting effect is expected to be small , of the order @xmath18 .    the main attention will be devoted to the fully dissipative regime .",
    "vanishing of the total shift of the mass - center position will be taken as the steady state condition .",
    "it will be shown that it is equivalent to the condition of vanishing acceleration along the direction perpendicular to both the current flow and the magnetic field direction .",
    "for the sake of simplicity the outlined idea will be described in detail for a two - dimensional electron system since the extension to three - dimensional systems is straightforward .",

    "the section vi will be devoted to the non - dissipative regime , which is closely related to the effect of the magnetic field on the static electron polarizability .",
    "it will be shown that the polarizability of open systems is modified by the lorentz force giving rise to a non - dissipative hall current exclusively determined by demagnetization currents . in the section vii",
    "it will be argued that in standard hall bar measurement the current flow is composed of two contributions , that induced by the electric field along the current flow and that originated in demagnetization currents .",
