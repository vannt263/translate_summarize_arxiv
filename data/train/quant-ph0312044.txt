    "a domain is a partially ordered set with intrinsic notions of completeness and approximation .",
    "recently@xcite , the authors have proven the existence of a natural domain theoretic structure in probability theory and quantum mechanics . the way to understand",
    "this structure is with the aid of the concept _ partiality . _ _ _    to illustrate , in the domain @xmath0 , the powerset of the natural numbers ordered by inclusion , a finite set will be partial , while the set @xmath1 will be total . in the domain @xmath2 , the domain of bit streams with the prefix order , a finite string is partial , the infinite strings are total . in the domain @xmath3 , the collection of compact intervals @xmath4",
    "$ ] of the real line ordered by reverse inclusion , an interval like @xmath5 $ ] with @xmath6 rational is partial , while a one point interval @xmath7 $ ] representing a real number is total . in the domain @xmath8 , the @xmath9 dimensional mixed states in the spectral order ( to be defined later ) , a pure state is total , while mixed states which are not pure are partial . in all the cases above ,",
    "total elements coincide with elements which are _ maximal _ in the given order . _",
    "_    as we can see , the partiality idea arises naturally in both computer science and physics .",
    "the idea is important in computer science .",
    "we will review results herein which show that by reasoning about density operators as partial and total objects , one can derive the classical and quantum logics of birkhoff and von neumann as special order theoretic subsets .",
    "because of this , we conclude that partiality is also an important idea in physics .",
    "given that the idea is important , the main question asked in this paper is `` what is an appropriate mathematical setting for discussing partiality ? ''    first we review the traditional axioms for domains , which succeed at capturing the notion partiality for objects like sets , strings and intervals .",
    "then we consider the bayesian and spectral orders on classical and quantum states , which are ` domains ' that possess the same notion of completeness as do classical domains , but differ in that they offer a new notion of approximation .",
    "we then enumerate much of what we know about the order theoretic structure of these two new domains in the hope that it will point the way for an inspired reader to discover a proper generalization of classical domains that will have desirable properties useful to both physicists and computer scientists .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , a domain @xmath10 is a partially ordered set with notions of completeness and approximation .",
    "the completeness can be used for example to prove fixed point theorems , which themselves might be used to provide a semantics for recursion , or establish the existence of solutions to ordinary differential equations . explaining approximation is more difficult .",
    "the order on a domain can be used to define many topologies , some of which can be used to recover notions of limit that we are familiar with from analysis .",
    "one use for _ approximation _  which itself is a relation @xmath11 contained in @xmath12  is that it can clarify these topologies for us , helping us to connect them to more familiar ideas .",
    "a more subtle use for approximation is in formalizing the notion _ partiality . _ to give a simple example , an object @xmath13 approximates something  formally , there is @xmath14 with @xmath15  if and only if @xmath16 is finite .",
