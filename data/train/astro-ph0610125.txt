    "the evolution and current state of the universe has become amenable to a number of astronomical and experimental probes . in the past few years , it has become possible to measure its geometry , expansion rate and constituents with unprecedented precision .",
    "the recent measurement of the anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background with the wilkinson anisotropy microwave probe satellite has further improved constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite . we now believe that we have identified an accurate and consistent model of the universe based on the general theory of relativity .",
    "however our current model relies on the existence of extremely exotic forms of energy : dark matter which clumps gravitationally but does not interact with light and dark energy which is repulsive under gravity .",
    "furthermore , we must posit that @xmath0 of the energy density of the universe is taken up by these exotic components",
    ". there are proposals for their fundamental origin but as yet no compelling explanation .",
    "an alternative possibility is that gravity is not what it seems and that general relativity should be modified on certain scales .",
    "a notable example of this is the relativistic theory of modified newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "in this theory , dark matter is replaced by a modification of the gravitational interaction , through the inclusion of a scalar and vector field .",
    "these extra fields can compensate for the absence of cold dark matter on galactic and galactic - cluster scales , and at the cosmological horizon .",
    "other proposals involving additional metrics and a combination of scalar , vector and tensor fields have been proposed .",
    "typically these models are constructed with the goal of reproducing observation but with little or no basis on fundamental principles .",
    "mostly they are plagued with inconsistencies at the quantum level ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "recenty , one of us has proposed an action for einstein gravity coupled with a vector field that leads to modifications to conventional gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "the action is constructed strictly according to the rules for an effective field theory with a mass scale cutoff , @xmath1 : all lorentz invariant terms containing the vector field and metric up to a predefined order in @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the energy scale at which the theory is being considered ) are included .",
    "the theory is manifestly self - consistent at energy scales below the cutoff @xmath1 , and the usual problems of theories of modified gravity , such as ghosts @xcite , strong - coupling @xcite , and discontinuities @xcite are absent .",
    "the vector field has a lorentz - invariant mass term with the wrong sign , which leads to a vacuum expectation value for the vector field and spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance . as a result",
    "one finds that there are additional graviton modes and modified dispersion relations .",
    "moreover , the new terms in the action lead to additional terms in the equations of motion which affect the dynamics of the universe on very large scales .",
    "it is this latter aspect of the theory that we wish to explore in this paper .",
    "our work in this paper complements that presented in @xcite where it has been shown that lorentz - violating vector fields may slow down the expansion rate of the universe . in their analysis ,",
    "the authors consider a fixed norm vector field , pinned down through a lagrange multiplier term in the action .",
    "furthermore , they examine a simplification of the theory presented in @xcite by restricting themselves to quadratic terms in the the vector field . in this paper",
    "we include higher order terms and allow the norm of the vector field to vary .",
    "a fixed norm case will be considered as a limiting case where a coupling constant in the potential for the vector field becomes infinite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ recap ]",
    "we present the action and briefly discuss other attempts at studying lorentz violation from vector fields . in section [ evol ]",
    "we write down the general equations of motion .",
    "we then specialise to the case of a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime . as will become apparent",
    ", the parameter space of this theory is immense .",
    "there are effectively 6 coupling constants and three energy scales that play a role .",
    "we briefly discuss the range of parameters that need to be explored in [ para ] . in the following three sections we look at the dynamics in more detail . in section [ timelike ]",
    "we focus on the case in which the norm of the vector field is fixed .",
    "this corresponds to the case where a coupling constant of the potential is infinite and the theory becomes an extension of the theory studied in @xcite . in section",
    "[ free ] we set the potential energy to zero and allow the vector field to roam freely .",
    "this allows us to study the impact of the multiple derivative couplings between the vector field and the metric .",
    "we then look at the more general case in section [ general ] and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",

    "in particular , we now find that the @xmath38 equation ( a constraint equation in general relativity ) contains second derivatives of the scale factor which appear in @xmath26 .",
    "this situation is similar to the situation one encounters in higher - derivative theories of gravity .",
    "it is not unexpected : in @xcite , two additional graviton modes are found , a clear indication that we should find more degrees of freedom in this theory than are present in conventional einstein gravity .",
    "because of the large number of independent , lorentz - invariant , two - derivative terms in the effective action , the parameter space for this theory is large .",
    "even though we have restricted ourselves to a homogeneous and isotropic universe , we must still contend with eight coefficients , @xmath21 , and the coupling constant , @xmath12 . inspecting the equations of motion",
    ", we find that there are degeneracies . @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 multiply equivalent terms as do @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    ", we shall restrict ourselves to sub - spaces of the full parameter space in what follows ; the full dynamics are simply too complex .",
    "but we emphasize that the true spirit of effective field theories does not allow us to selectively discard terms .",
    "there are also three relevant dimensionful scales , namely the planck scale @xmath51 , the cutoff @xmath1 , and the observation scale @xmath52 . from these",
    ", we define the two dimensionless ratios @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "corrections to general relativity in the weak field limit are of order @xmath55 . the observation scale can be defined in terms of the energy density , @xmath56 by fixing the scale factor , @xmath57 to be unity at the time of observation .",
    "we then have @xmath58 where @xmath59 depends on the equation of state of the matter component .",
    "so , in addition to the six dimensionless parameters we have two dimensionless energy scales .",
    "we clearly have a very large space of parameters to explore . to do so , and with the aim of illustrating qualitatively the possible cosmological dynamics",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to considering subspaces of the full parameter space in what follows . to this end , in the rest of this paper , we will try to identify what kind of behaviour each of the terms in the effective action , pinned to a given parameter , will generate .",
    "in the limit of @xmath12 tending to infinity , we expect the vector field to be fixed at the minimum of the potential .",
    "this can also be realized by including a fixed - norm constraint to the action , of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a lagrange multiplier , which yields the constraint upon variation .",
    "now , the time derivatives of * a * vanish . if @xmath63 , as if the norm of a timelike unit vector , then we have * * a**=(m,0,0,0 ) . the equations obtained by varying the action with respect to the vector field and the 00th component of the metric",
    "then reduce to @xmath64 eliminating the lagrange multiplier @xmath62 and converting to @xmath65 and @xmath66 coefficients yields the following modified friedmann equation @xmath67 in this limit , we then have an effective rescaling of the gravitational constant @xmath68 in the cosmological background , as found in @xcite .",
    "let us now look at the dynamics of the system which result from discarding the potential term .",
    "the vector field is now free to vary subject to the couplings between its kinetic terms and the metric .",
    "we first focus on the case in which @xmath70 , with the remaining coupling constants vanishing . varying with respect to the vector and @xmath71th component of the metric yields @xmath72 .",

    "we then have @xmath80 we can now rewrite the second equation as @xmath81 whose homogeneous part has the solution @xmath82 the dominant term at late times comes from the particular integral @xmath83 the particular integrals due to the pressure term of the matter / radiation are @xmath84 we can find the vector field from the definition of @xmath85 .",
    "the dominant solution is @xmath86 as we can see , in this reduced space of parameters we have an attractor solution given by @xmath78 and @xmath87 .",
    "an altogether different type of behaviour emerges if we consider all constants to be zero , except for @xmath7 .",

    "then , with @xmath95 , we find @xmath96 which can be solved as follows .",
    "firstly , we consider separately the cases where @xmath97 is positive or negative , denoted by @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "integrating , we find @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively , where @xmath102 is a constant of integration . integrating again yields @xmath103 and @xmath104 where d is an integration constant .",
    "we now have a complete solution for @xmath105 .",
    "note that the solution is singular , with @xmath106 in a finite time , for @xmath107 .",
    "this type of behaviour arises because of the novel type of coupling that arises when considering a vector field .",
    "the lorentz structure of the vector field leads to a coupling with derivatives of the metric and hence to second derivatives in the would - be constraint equations and equations of motion .",
    "these lead to instabilities in the solutions of the equations of motion , a finite time singularity in this case .",
    "these instabilities presumably signal deeper pathologies in the effective field theory description .",
    "if only @xmath108 is non - zero , the @xmath38-th and @xmath71-th equations are , respectively ,    @xmath109    the vector field equation is @xmath110 multiplying the @xmath71-th equation by three , and adding to the @xmath38-th equation we recover @xmath111 where we have used the vector equation .",
    "we see that , in this case , the evolution is identical to that of general relativity . for the case of only @xmath112 ,",
    "the same applies , with the caveat that , in the weak coupling limit , there is nothing to stop @xmath113 approaching values beyond the applicability of the effective action .",
    "finally , we remark that the case in which @xmath114 is significantly more complicated , given the appearance of a wide variety of terms in each equation .",
    "we may , however , combine the vector and @xmath71-th equations so as to to obtain two equations , each containing just one type of second - order time derivative term . in this way , we obtain expressions for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath116 equation is singular at @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we will see later that in the corresponding case with a natural value of @xmath12 , physically viable solutions are obtained only for positive @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , for acceptable values of @xmath120 the second singularity will be real and lie above @xmath121 . solving the equations numerically",
    ", we find that for @xmath122 the system generically reaches the singularity at @xmath117 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , whilst for @xmath123 the system reaches the second singularity .",
    "we now consider solutions for natural values of the parameters @xmath124 ( order unity ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 is assumed to be positive . in @xcite , it was argued that @xmath125 could be as high as @xmath126 and as low as @xmath127 and we will opt to look for behaviour between these bounds . even with these considerations ,",
    "the parameter space remains vast so we will proceed , as before , by considering the effect of isolated non - vanishing @xmath128 and @xmath129 parameters . following this , we will consider a few non - vanishing combinations of @xmath128 and @xmath129 which yield novel behaviour .",
    "reasonable initial conditions are @xmath130 and all remaining constants equal to zero .",
    "recall that this is the case where only the @xmath131 term contributes in the action .",
    "from ( [ eq : vector ] ) see that , peculiarly , second derivatives of the vector field @xmath116 are absent from the vector field equation and present in the metric field equation whereas @xmath132 appears in both .",
    "hence the vector equation becomes an evolution equation for @xmath133    we find for all values of @xmath125 that the field @xmath120 undergoes damped oscillations , irrespective of the sign of @xmath134 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath135 , @xmath116 is dominated by @xmath136 where the ellipsis denotes damping terms , which are small independently of the sign of @xmath134 . in the limit of @xmath137",
    ", we have that @xmath138 .",
    "thus we generically approach a loitering solution where the scale factor @xmath57 grows linearly in time .",
    "if we now consider only @xmath139 , we note that second derivatives of @xmath133 and @xmath120 appear in each field equation , an indication of how the coupling to the vector field modifies the kinetic terms of the metric .",
    "consequently , for instance , terms in the metric equation of order 1 or lower in time derivatives contribute to @xmath116 to a degree suppressed by @xmath55 . as in the weak coupling limit @xcite",
    ", the sign of @xmath140 has an impact on the evolution .",
    "it is found that positive values of @xmath140 generically lead to unbounded growth in @xmath120 , whilst negative values ( of order unity ) lead to oscillations about @xmath1 , damped roughly on a timescale @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , at times much greater than this , the vector field will lie fixed at @xmath121 , and we can read off the resulting contribution to the metric equation as @xmath142 . the evolution equation for the scale factor now becomes : @xmath143 we can interpret this as a rescaling of the gravitational constant @xmath68 . as discussed in @xcite , this",
    "can only be detected by comparison with regimes where the vector field may rescale @xmath68 by a differing amount .",
    "-0.37 in    it is interesting to note that another consistent solution may emerge for high values of @xmath125- that is values of order unity . in this range",
    "we see that @xmath120 may be attracted to a fixed solution at @xmath144 , now close to m ( see top panel of figure [ fig2 ] ) . at @xmath145",
    "we have that @xmath146 to understand the nature of this solution , we consider the evolution of the ratio of the scale factor @xmath147 to the scale factor @xmath148 resulting from the same initial conditions but in the absence of the vector field , i.e. as in pure general relativity .",
    "this ratio is plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the stability of this solution depends on the sign of @xmath149 : for @xmath150 , @xmath151 grows linearly with time and @xmath120 is constant , leading to an asymptotic solution at late times of the form @xmath152 where @xmath102 is a constant of integration . in this limit the evolution of the vector field and metric",
    "are overwhelmingly dominated by terms in @xmath151 .",
    "we can consider the stability of this solution by considering the evolution of small perturbations to @xmath133 and @xmath120 .",
    "the first order perturbation @xmath153 to @xmath120 is found to obey @xmath154    the general solution to this equation is : @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are integration constants and @xmath158 and @xmath159 are whittaker @xmath1 and @xmath160 functions .",
    "we have checked that @xmath161 as @xmath162 for the appropriate values of @xmath125 , such that the solution is stable .    in the case that @xmath163 , @xmath151 will decrease linearly in time whilst",
    "the vector field is in the vicinity of @xmath164 .",
    "note that with the opposite sign of @xmath149 , perturbations ( as in ( [ eq : pert ] ) ) are no longer stable .",
    "thus we may expect that if the system can reach a fixed solution at @xmath164 it will only do so briefly before moving away .",
    "this is amply illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] . for @xmath165 ( @xmath150 )",
    "the system quickly settles to the solution @xmath145 prompting runaway growth in @xmath166 . for @xmath167 ( @xmath163 )",
    "the system settles briefly at @xmath145 , during which time @xmath166 is enhanced significantly , before departing to the solution @xmath121 . for @xmath168 ( and all",
    "lower values of @xmath125 ) the vector field never reaches @xmath164 and settles to the @xmath121 tracking solution described by ( [ eq : a2track ] ) .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to @xmath114 and discard all other terms .",
    "we note that for the ranges of @xmath125 considered , the values at which @xmath116 is singular ( see [ free ] ) arguably lie beyond the regime of validity of the effective action .",
    "for negative @xmath119 , @xmath120 experiences unbounded growth in the direction of the initial perturbation , as in section [ free ] , and so will generically reach singularities . for positive @xmath119 , the vector field undergoes oscillations about @xmath1 .",
    "numerical exploration suggests that the system will evolve so that the oscillations will be of increasing frequency and amplitude up until @xmath169 .",
    "terms in @xmath170 then act to halt the expansion of the universe leading to eventual collapse ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if we consider @xmath171 or @xmath112 , we recover familiar behaviour .",
    "the vector field s stress energy tensor contributes only first derivatives in time and terms such as @xmath172 and @xmath115 do not appear in the vector field equation ; thus , @xmath120 contributes and evolves much like a scalar field .",
    "it is found that for positive values of @xmath108 and for negative values of @xmath173 , the vector field oscillates about @xmath120 .",
    "it undergoes hubble friction , the oscillations decaying on a timescale @xmath174 . settling towards @xmath121 ,",
    "the potential terms vanish as before and so the effect on the expansion of the universe is as in the weak - coupling limit i.e. identical to that of general relativity .",
    "-0.37 in    w    an interesting simplification is obtained for particular the combination of coefficients , given by @xmath175 . with this combination ,",
    "@xmath132 drops out from the vector equation .",
    "for acceptable values of @xmath125 , the vector field oscillates about @xmath1 , the background expansion gradually settling the field to this value .",
    "this happens on a timescale of roughly @xmath176 .",
    "thus at times larger than this the metric equation reduces to @xmath177 again this behaviour can be interpreted as a rescaling of @xmath68 or , in this case , as the tensor @xmath170 tracking any form of matter field in the universe .",
    "finally , we would like to make a general point about the appearance of singularities in this system .",
    "the field equations can be written schematically as : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is of the form @xmath180 and where @xmath181 .",
    "when the terms in parentheses are nonvanishing , there will may occur singularities in the evolution for particular values of @xmath182 .",
    "an example of this was encountered in [ free ] for only @xmath114 .",
    "we expect @xmath125 to be of order @xmath183 or smaller and @xmath184 to be of order unity . hence , generally , @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the second terms in parenthesis may be expected to be suppressed relative to the first by @xmath55 .",
    "it is unlikely then that @xmath179 may vanish due to equality of the first and second terms in parenthesis .",
    "an alternative is for both groups of terms to vanish identically .",
    "this would seem to require of the first that @xmath186 vanishes along with at least one term from the second group . when considering isolated non - vanishing coefficients , restrictions on their sign",
    "were found to be @xmath187 and @xmath188 respectively .",
    "this would seem to imply that @xmath189 is inherently positive .",
    "it may only vanish when each of the coefficients are zero , in which case @xmath179 may only vanish if @xmath134 is alzo zero . however",
    ", we emphasize that the restrictions on the sign of individual coefficients need not hold when general combinations of @xmath190 are considered .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the cosmology of the model proposed in @xcite . as expected",
    ", there is a wide range of possible behaviours .",
    "we achieve accelerated expansion if we have a term with @xmath191 and a high mass scale @xmath1 .",
    "the system will scale when @xmath192 , or when @xmath191 with a low mass scale .",
    "if @xmath193 , the universe will recollapse , while it will loiter if we only have @xmath194 . clearly we have only looked at a small subset of the parameter space but our analysis has allowed us to probe these different regimes .",
    "it also allows us to make some comments about the structure of the theory .",
    "firstly , we stress again that this is an effective field theory , valid at energies below the cutoff , @xmath1 . in some cases",
    ", we have found that this theory is unstable , in the sense that runaway solutions push the theory beyond its regime of validity . to properly understand its behaviour in these regimes , we would need to at least consider higher order corrections , and ultimately some ultra - violet completion of the theory would be necessary . such a completion might conceivably simply involve extra fields @xcite , or , more likely , more complicated dynamics .    secondly , the lorentz structure of the vector field in this framework introduces a novel phenomenon . for theories with @xmath195 and @xmath196",
    "we find second derivatives of the scale factor appear in what would have been ( in standard general relativity ) constraint equations , and in the evolution equations for the vector field .",
    "we find that this leads to possible instabilities in the cosmology .",
    "clearly , there is a need for a complete perturbative analysis of this theory in a cosmological setting , akin the study of gauss - bonnet or higher - derivative modifications to gravity @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the results found here can be added to known cosmological consequences of lorentz violating fields : de sitter expansion and dust - like stress energy tensor in background @xcite , pervasive tracking solutions in background @xcite , and generating the instability permitting the growth of large scale structure @xcite .",
    "finally , the theory discussed here , though complex in its structure , should be amenable to a detailed comparison with current cosmological observations .",
    "we have laid down the framework for looking at constraints on the background evolution .",
    "the next step is to construct the evolution equations for linear perturbations . with these in hand",
    ", it should be possible to harness the wealth of new , high precision cosmological observations and use them to provide constraints on this theory .",
