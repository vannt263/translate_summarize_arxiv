    "many collapsed models we could not continue simulations till the very end as these runs were virtually brought to a stop due to the extremely large gas densities developed at the center of the halo .",
    "as a result , the @xmath131 values we list in table  [ tab3 ] should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the precise value is probably not very important , as in real systems a star burst should occur some time after the core becomes jeans unstable , which would dramatically change the following evolution of the mini - galaxy .",
    "the main results of our work are summarized in figure  [ fig2 ] and table  [ tab3 ] . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the critical value of the lyman - werner flux @xmath201 for all our models as a function of @xmath232 , @xmath111 , and @xmath80 .",
    "models with @xmath233 collapse within a local hubble time , and do not collapse for larger fluxes . from figure  [ fig2 ] one can see that the impact of external photo - dissociating radiation is most significant for halos with @xmath234  m@xmath5 and @xmath235 , where even a small flux @xmath236 can prevent the halo from collapsing at a redshift of 15 . as figure  [ fig2]b shows",
    ", @xmath237 is a very strong function of @xmath80 . at @xmath196 ,",
    "the halo with @xmath238  m@xmath5 will collapse even outside a cosmological filament ( @xmath226 ) , whereas at @xmath197 the halo with @xmath239  m@xmath5 can collapse only for @xmath240 ( if @xmath241 ) . halos with a given virial mass are more immune to the external lyman - werner radiation at larger @xmath80 due to a combination of several factors : ( a ) halos with the same @xmath113 have larger virial temperature at larger @xmath80 ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) , ( b ) the average gas density in the universe grows as @xmath242 ( eq .  [ [ rho_b ] ] ) , and ( c ) the temperature of the cosmic microwave background grows as @xmath243 , resulting in much stronger compton cooling at larger redshifts ( see eq .",
    "[ [ l2 ] ] ) .    on a more detailed level , the impact of varying the lyman - werner flux on gas dynamics can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ] . here",
    "we plot the central gas density and temperature as a function of time for our fiducial halo with @xmath238  m@xmath5 , @xmath195 , and @xmath212 for different values of @xmath114 . from this plot",
    "one can see that a larger photo - dissociation flux results in the central gas density growing more slowly and the central gas temperature decreasing more slowly . also ,",
    "the final temperature of the collapsed core increases with increasing flux , reaching @xmath244  k for @xmath245 .",
    "it takes longer for the core to become jeans unstable ( circles in figure  [ fig3 ] ) for larger @xmath114 .",
    "when the flux reaches @xmath246 , no collapse occurs within the evolution time of 300  myr , though the central temperature decreases to @xmath247  k and the central density grows to @xmath248  @xmath81 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] can be used to estimate the importance of different physical processes on the dynamics of the collapsing halo . here",
    "we show the evolution of the lowest value of the virial ratio @xmath223 within the virial extent of the halo for our fiducial case with @xmath239  m@xmath5 , @xmath195 , @xmath212 , and @xmath249 .",
    "we show the results for a full run ( solid line ) and for a few additional simulations with some of the physical processes turned off .",
    "the first most obvious effect is that turning the h@xmath12 cooling off changes the dynamics dramatically : when the h@xmath12 cooling is included , the core collapses after @xmath250  myr , whereas when @xmath251 , the halo is very far from a collapse even at the end of the simulations ( after 300  myr ) .",
    "another interesting result is that the impact of the photo - detachment of h@xmath20 ( reaction 23 in table  [ tab1 ] ; eq .",
    "[ [ k23 ] ] ) on the overall collapse dynamics is negligible  despite the fact that we use the most conservative power law exponent @xmath51 to describe the spectrum of the external radiation ( corresponding to radiation produced by quasars ) . in a more realistic case ,",
    "at least a fraction of the external radiation flux should come from stellar sources , further reducing the importance of the h@xmath20 photo - detachment reaction on dynamics of mini - galaxies in defunct cosmological h  ii regions .",
    "it follows that the only important photo - reaction for our objects is the direct photo - dissociation of h@xmath12 molecules by lyman - werner photons .    from the analysis of figure  [ fig4 ] it appears that the next most significant process ( after h@xmath12 cooling ) is the atomic hydrogen line cooling ( long - dashed lines ) , followed by compton cooling and hydrogen recombination cooling .",
    "the rest of the cooling processes have negligible impact on the evolution of the halo .",
    "we draw reader s attention to the fact that the importance of the h line cooling is a strong function of the assumed initial temperature of the fully photo - ionized gas .",
    "e.g. , lowering @xmath97 from @xmath0 to @xmath252  k reduces the initial values of @xmath253 by a factor of @xmath254 ( see eq . [ [ l1 ] ] ) .",
    "it also lowers the ratio @xmath255 , so the overall dynamics of the collapse should not be affected much .",
    "we conclude that at the redshift of @xmath256 atomic hydrogen line cooling , compton cooling , and hydrogen recombination cooling are of roughly comparable importance for the dynamics of our mini - galaxies .    in figure  [ fig5 ] we plot the radial profiles for our fiducial halo for three different times @xmath257 , 144 ( when the core becomes jeans unstable ) , and 300  myr .",
    "as one can see in figure  [ fig5]a , initially the core becomes unstable at the very center of the halo , later involving the whole virial extent of the halo .",
    "figure  [ fig5]b demonstrates that at the late stages of the collapse a dominant fraction of the total gas mass inside the virial radius of the halo has been accreted by the core , and that the accretion proceeds with increasingly larger gas radial infall speeds .",
    "a very interesting effect can be seen in figures  [ fig5]c and [ fig5]d : after the core becomes jeans unstable , the infalling gas becomes increasingly hotter near the core due to adiabatic compression , leading to an increasingly larger hydrogen ionization fraction near the core , and , as a result , to increased h@xmath12 production in this area .",
    "this , in turn , increases cooling of the gas in the central parts of the halo , accelerating the overall collapse process .",
    "it thus appears that gas in mini - galaxies forming in the defunct cosmological h  ii regions can be effectively cooled by h@xmath12 molecules formed due to high non - equilibrium abundance of free electrons not only initially , before the onset of the collapse , but also at the advanced stages of the collapse .",
    "this leads to a much more significant positive feedback of ionizing radiation on star formation in small galaxies in the early universe .    from the analysis of figure  [ fig5 ] it is obvious",
    "that the collapse is severely under - resolved in our models .",
    "e.g. , one can see the gas infall velocity discontinuity around radius of @xmath258 ( figure  [ fig5]b ) , and dramatic changes in temperature and density slopes at the same radius ( figure  [ fig5]c ) .",
    "the important question is then how robust are our above conclusions given that the collapse is not fully resolved ?    unfortunately , it is not feasible to run higher resolution simulations with our scalar version of the code hydra . instead , we address the above issue by re - running our models with @xmath239  m@xmath5 and @xmath195 with two different number of particles , @xmath259 and @xmath260 , with the size of the periodic computational box being twice smaller than in the original simulations : 2.5 instead of 5  kpc . in half - box simulations",
    "the initial hydrostatic gas distribution and overall collaspe dynamics is somewhat different from the full - box simulations , so these new runs are not meant to be directly compared with the original simulations .",
    "instead , one has to compare the half - box low resolution simulations ( which have the same spatial resolution as our original runs : @xmath261  pc ) with the half - box high resolutions simulations ( spatial resolution is twice better : @xmath262  pc ) .",

    "one can see from this table that in the higher resolution simulations the collapse takes place @xmath282% earlier at a twice smaller radius , and involves initially @xmath283 times less gas .",
    "the dynamics of the collapse for both cases can be followed in figure  [ fig6 ] , where we show the evolution of the central gas density and temperature for our fiducial halo .",
    "as one can see in figure  [ fig6 ] , the central gas density grows faster and reaches larger values in the higher resolution simulations .",
    "importantly , in the higher @xmath91 case the growth rate of the gas density is not affected by spatial resolution even for some time after the onset of the jeans instability ( empty circles in figure  [ fig6 ] ) , whereas in the lower resolution case the sharp change in the density growth rate takes place at the onset of the instability .",
    "this indicates that at least the initial stage of the core collapse is resolved in our higher resolution simulations .",
    "interestingly , the final central temperature of the gas is the same in the both cases ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see why in the higher resolution case the collapse takes place earlier .",
    "indeed , from figure  [ fig1 ] one can see that all our initial hydrostatic gas density profiles have a cusp with a small slope at the center of the halo . as a result ,",
    "the higher the spatial resolution of the simulations , the larger is the initial density of the resolved gas in the core , leading to stronger cooling and faster evolution . as the slope of the density cusp is small , we expect this process to converge at some large @xmath91",
    ". indeed , as we progress to larger @xmath91 , a very moderate increase in the resolved gas density ( and hence of the cooling rate ) would correspond to much smaller mass of the gas affected by the cooling , resulting in negligible impact on the dynamics of the system for large enough @xmath91 .",
    "more quantitatively , if the initial gas density near the halo center is @xmath284 and the spatial resolution is @xmath122 , then the mass of the unresolved core is @xmath285 and the average core density is @xmath286 .",
    "as the cooling per atom is proportional to @xmath287 , the global core cooling is proportional to @xmath288 , which approaches zero as @xmath289 ( @xmath290 ) for shallow cusps with @xmath291 .",
    "all of our models initially had @xmath292 .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] allows a detailed comparison of the final gas profiles in our half - box simulations for the cases of low and high resolution . from figure  [ fig7]b one can see that the final mass of the collapsed gas is comparable in the both cases , and that the gas infall velocity discontinuity is even sharper and takes place at a twice smaller radius in the higher @xmath91 case .",
    "most importantly , the higher resolution simulations confirm and re - enforce our above conclusion that the non - equilibrium formation of h@xmath12 molecules in our objects is not restricted to the initial stage of the collapse and is instead an ongoing process , becoming potentially even more important at the advanced stages of the collapse .",
    "this is evident in figures  [ fig7]c and [ fig7]d , which show that in the higher resolution simulations the gas temperature near the core is even higher , with the hot gas zone extending to even smaller radius , than in the lower @xmath91 case , resulting in higher non - equilibrium electron abundance and hence higher h@xmath12 abundance in the core region .",
    "it is not clear from the above results if our higher resolution half - box simulations are close to numerical convergence .",
    "nevertheless , by comparing our low and high @xmath91 simulations we can make a robust conclusion that the models presented in this paper capture the essence of the gas collapse process in primordial mini - galaxies forming in defunct cosmological h  ii regions .",
    "our results are conservative in the sense that higher resolution , and presumably more realistic , simulations would lead to mini - galaxies forming even faster and potentially even under larger fluxes of external lyman - werner radiation .",
    "the traditional point of view is that soon after the formation of the first stars in the universe inside small halos at @xmath293 the formation of the next generation of mini - galaxies with @xmath294  k was suppressed due to build up of the metagalactic h@xmath12 photo - dissociating background @xcite .",
    "recent cosmological @xcite and semi - cosmological @xcite simulations with radiative transfer questioned the above argument by showing that in defunct cosmological h  ii regions in overdense regions of the early universe ( @xmath295 ) the formation of the mini - galaxies can be boosted due to non - equilibrium chemistry . in our paper we study the above mechanism of positive feedback of ionizing radiation on small galaxy formation by running a large set of simulations of galaxy formation inside defunct h  ii regions . by employing a non - cosmological approach we produced a sequence of models with precisely controlled and reproducible ( though idealized ) initial and boundary conditions .",
    "this helped us to focus on the most relevant physical processes at work in our objects .",
    "most importantly , we derived the critical fluxes of the background lyman - werner radiation sufficient to prevent the collapse of gas in mini - galaxies with @xmath294  k at @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the positive feedback mechanism becomes much more efficient at larger @xmath80 for galaxies with given virial mass , and confirmed the result of @xcite that it is efficient inside filaments with the overdensity of @xmath296 .",
    "we studied the details of the process of the gas collapse in a pre - ionized mini - galaxy exposed to external lyman - werner radiation .",
    "we conclude that , similarly to the canonical case of small galaxy formation in non - ionized regions of the universe @xcite , the reaction of photo - detachment of h@xmath20 has a negligible impact on the dynamics of the collapse .",
    "this leaves the direct photo - dissociation of h@xmath12 molecules by metagalactic lyman - werner radiation as the only important photo - reaction .",
    "we identified the h@xmath12 , hydrogen line , compton , and hydrogen recombination coolings as the only important cooling processes .",
    "hydrogen collisional ionization cooling and bremsstrahlung cooling are shown to be not important for our objects .",
    "we found that for the mini - galaxies forming in defunct h  ii regions the non - equilibrium h@xmath12 formation has an important dynamical effect not only during the initial phase leading to the core of the galaxy becoming jeans unstable , but also later on during the advanced stages of the core collapse .",
    "this mechanism allows the core of the mini - galaxy to accrete significant mass by the time the central star burst disrupts the accretion .",
    "our results give further support to the @xcite picture of formation and evolution of mini - galaxies in the early universe . in this picture ,",
    "first mini - galaxies form at high redshift ( @xmath293 ) , when the metagalactic lyman - werner background is close to zero , due to cosmological non - zero residual fraction of free electrons resulting in efficient h@xmath12 cooling .",
    "the stars in the mini - galaxy ionize gas inside the halo and in nearby halos , creating conditions for efficient h@xmath12 cooling due to non - equilibrium electron abundance after the pop iii stars ( believed to be very massive and short - lived ) die . as we confirmed here",
    ", this process is tolerant to relatively large fluxes of the external lyman - werner radiation .",
    "the process can repeat itself with a time scale of a few tens of millions years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; this paper ) , allowing the mini - galaxy to survive through the `` difficult times '' of the universe being filled with the h@xmath12 photo - dissociating radiation until the universe is reionized before @xmath297 .",
    "these repetitive local star bursts will result in the metallicity of the local intergalactic medium increasing with time .",
    "if the metallicity becomes larger than @xmath298 , the star - formation will switch from pop  iii to pop  ii mode ( e.g. @xcite ) , producing a long - living stellar population , which should survive until the present time .",
    "the size of the collapsed cores in our simulations is very small ( @xmath299  pc ) and is comparable to the sizes of globular clusters .",
    "it is tempting then to associate this final pop  ii star burst at the core of the mini - galaxy with the formation of a metal - poor globular cluster  at least for the halos with the lowest values of the specific angular momentum .",
    "we showed @xcite that the dm halos of such objects can be tidally stripped when they are accreted by larger galaxies .",
    "this could be considered as a revised version of the primordial picture of globular cluster formation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "alternatively , these surviving mini - galaxies could end up contributing to the population of dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .    in   [ results ]",
    "we discussed the impact of the limited resolution on the results of our simulations .",
    "our conclusion was that even though our highest spatial resolution simulations could not completely resolve the dynamics of the collapsing core , we believe that we captured the essence of the collapse process . we want to emphasize that in our simulations the physics driving the collapse ( primordial chemistry and cooling ) is resolved much better than hydrodynamics .",
    "as figure  [ fig5]d demonstrates , during the most critical initial phase of the core collapse the enhanced non - equilibrium production of h@xmath12 molecules is not restricted to the core region , and instead takes place over a wide range of distances from the center of the halo .",
    "another confirmation of the chemistry being well resolved in our models can be found in table  [ tab4 ] , where one can see that the critical fluxes of the external photo - dissociating radiation @xmath201 are the same for both lower and higher resolution ( half - box ) simulations .",
    "recently , @xcite used the results of their simulations of the collapse of gas in a photo - ionized small galaxy in the early universe to argue that the uncertainties in the rate coefficients for the reactions 8 and 16 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) can lead to an order of magnitude uncertainty in the value of the critical flux of the external photo - dissociating radiation .",
    "we can not comment on this as we have not explored in our models the consequences of the uncertainties in the rates for the above reactions being large .",
    "if the results of @xcite are confirmed , this would potentially lead to up to a factor of a few error in our values of @xmath201 , with all the values being either systematically larger or smaller .",
    "we want to emphasize that it would not change our qualitative result that the efficient formation of mini - galaxies in fossil cosmological h  ii regions is possible even under relatively large levels of the metagalactic lyman - werner radiation .    how our results are affected by the simplifying assumptions we have made ?",
    "one of our model assumptions is that the process of photo - evaporation of the mini - galaxy is complete , with the gas becoming 100% ionized and reaching the state of hydrostatic equilibrium in the halo gravitational potential .",
    "this assumption allowed us to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the initial conditions .",
    "in reality , in many ( perhaps most ) cases , the gas in our objects would only be partially photo - ionized .",
    "the reason for this is that the typical sources of ionizing radiation at this early epoch would be massive stars ( individual or in small clusters ) , with their lifetimes being too short to allow the gas in the galaxy , which is being photo - evaporated , to reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium . assuming that initially the gas was almost neutral and had a temperature commensurate with the virial temperature of the halo @xmath300  k , an incomplete photo - evaporation would result in a partially ionized gas with the core density larger than in the fully photo - ionized state .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such a system should collapse at least as easily ( or even easier ) as a fully photo - ionized one , as long as the electron abundance of the photo - ionized gas is significantly larger than the residual cosmological value of @xmath301 . in this sense , the above assumption is a conservative one .",
    "our assumption of the gas being optically thin to radiation is also a conservative one , as the self - shielding of the gas would reduce the lyman - werner radiation flux near the center of the halo , where the production of h@xmath12 molecules takes place during the advanced stages of the core collapse . in our fiducial halo",
    "simulated with the highest spatial resolution ( half - box simulations with @xmath302 ) , the optical depth for lyman - werner photons traveling from the outside of the halo to the smallest resolved radius of @xmath303  pc is around unity , indicating that self - shielding can be important for our objects ( especially at the late stages of the core collapse ) .",
    "@xcite used one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations incorporating non - equilibrium primordial gas chemistry to show that the gas cooling due to hd molecule can be an important dynamical factor at the late stages of the gas collapse in previously photo - ionized mini - galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite published a revised hd cooling function , with the cooling efficiency being larger than previously reported ( especially for hot and dense gas ) .",
    "this could potentially make the hd molecule cooling even more important for the dynamics of the collapsing gas in small primordial galaxies .",
    "we did not include hd chemistry in our model as these reactions would only become important when the collapsing core is no longer well resolved in our simulations .",
    "if included , the additional cooling due to hd molecules would only strengthen our conclusions .",
    "if gas in photo - evaporated mini - galaxies has significant global angular momentum this could affect our results and conclusions .",
    "the effect of angular momentum will be strongest during the advanced stages of the gas collapse . instead of a spherical core ,",
    "a central disk will be formed , reducing the central gas density .",
    "we argue that the non - zero angular momentum should not change qualitatively our main conclusions , as the non - equilibrium h@xmath12 formation , leading to the gas in the mini - galaxy becoming jeans unstable , takes place over a wide range of radial distances ( see thin solid line in figure  [ fig5]d ) , not just in the central densest region .",
    "@xcite noted that the ability of a cloud to collapse does not seem to strongly depend on the angular momentum of its dm halo . in any event",
    ", our results should be directly applicable to mini - galaxies with low values of the global gas angular momentum .",

    "<S> we confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of ionizing radiation on star formation in mini - galaxies proposed by @xcite can be efficient despite a significant flux of metagalactic photo - dissociating radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we derive critical fluxes for the lyman - werner background radiation sufficient to prevent the collapse of gas in mini - galaxies as a function of the virial mass of the halo and redshift . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the formation of mini - galaxies in defunct h  ii regions is most efficient at large redshifts ( @xmath2 ) and/or for large local gas overdensity @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that non - equilibrium chemistry plays an important dynamical role not only during the initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas becoming gravitationally unstable inside the mini - halo , but also at the advanced stages of the core collapse , resulting in efficient gas accretion in the core region . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on a possible connection between our objects and metal - poor globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies . </S>"
