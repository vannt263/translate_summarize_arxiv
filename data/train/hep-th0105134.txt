    "the general idea behind the holographic conjecture is that a conformal field theory defined on a @xmath1-dimensional boundary of a @xmath2-dimensional spacetime ( with prescribed asymptotic behaviour ) provides a sufficient description of the physics of quantum gravity in that spacetime .",
    "its most concrete manifestation has been due to the work of  maldacena @xcite and witten @xcite concerning the relation of  large @xmath3 gauge theories and conformal field theories . specifically , the conjectured correspondence is between the large @xmath3  limit of superconformal gauge theories and supergravity on @xmath4 spaces @xcite , one which has also been studied in connection with non - extremal black - hole physics @xcite .",
    "more precisely , consider the partition function of any field theory on @xmath4 defined by @xmath5=\\int_{{\\phi _",
    "{ o}}}{\\cal d}\\phi \\text { } e^{-s(\\phi ) } \\text { }   \\label{par}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the finite field defined on the boundary of @xmath4 and the integration is over the field configurations @xmath7 that approach @xmath8 when one goes from the bulk of @xmath4 to its boundary .",
    "the conjectured correspondence states that @xmath9 is identified with the generating functional @xmath10 of the boundary conformal field theory given by @xmath11=<\\exp \\left ( \\int_{\\partial { \\cal m}{_{d}}}d^{d}x\\sqrt{g}% { \\cal o}\\phi _ { 0}\\right ) >   \\label{par2}\\ ] ] for a quasi - primary conformal operator @xmath12 on the boundary @xmath13 of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this correspondence has been explicated for a free massive scalar field and a free @xmath14 gauge theory @xcite ; other examples , such as interacting massive scalar @xcite , free massive spinor @xcite and interacting scalar - spinor fields @xcite have also been investigated , along with classical gravity and type - iib string theory @xcite . in all these cases , the exact partition function ( [ par ] ) is given by the exponential of the action evaluated for a classical field configuration which solves the classical equations of motion , and explicit calculations show that the evaluated partition function is equal to the generating functional ( [ par2 ] ) of some conformal field theory with a quasi - primary operator of a certain conformal weight .",
    "these results encourage the expectation that an understanding of quantum gravity in a given spacetime ( at least one that is asymptotically ads ) can be carried out by studying  instead its dual theory , defined on the boundary of spacetime at infinity .",
    "this general `` holographic principle ''  of which the ads / cft correspondence can be viewed as a special case  has among other things the advantage that there are significantly fewer degrees of freedom in the holographic dual theory than there are in the bulk theory .",
    "consequently , it is natural to inquire about the relationship between objects in the bulk and their dual holographic counterparts , and much effort has been expended in this direction .",
    "for example the asymptotic behaviour of bulk fields is directly related to one - point functions in the cft @xcite , and it has been shown that the radial position of a position of a source particle following a bulk geodesic is encoded in the size and shape of an expectation - value bubble in the cft @xcite .  when distinct bulk solutions have the same asymptotic behaviour it has been argued that non - local objects in the cft are required to distinguish them ;",
    "specifically , propagator kinks in green s functions in the cft can be used to detect the presence of point particles in @xmath15-dimensional spacetimes that are asymptotically ads @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend these considerations to extended objects in the bulk .",
    "specifically , we consider topologically non - trivial solutions of abelian - higgs field equations in the four dimensional anti de sitter space .",
    "such vortex solutions have long been known in flat space @xcite , and have been of some interest in black hole physics in recent years since they provide a specific example of stable hair for the schwarzchild black hole in @xmath16 dimensions@xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate how a gauge vortex can be holographically represented via the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "these objects have some features in common with those of lower - dimensional point - particles : a cross - sectional slice at some fixed polar angle yields a spacetime approximately equivalent to that of a @xmath15-dimensional asymptotically ads spacetime with a point - particle .",
    "however unlike the point particle the vortex solution extends all the way to the boundary , entailing different considerations of  its relationship to the cft .",
    "the model we consider will appear as the low energy limit of any string theory containing the minimal supersymmetric standard model in some ( low - energy ) limit , along with a mechanism in which supersymmetry is broken only by super - renormalizable terms .",
    "the higgs field potential is given by the linear combination of the d - term of a scalar superfield potential , the f - term of another scalar field potential , and the most general superrenormalizable supersymmetry - breaking term .",
    "this term yields a potential and gauge couplings of the form we consider @xcite .",
    "the abelian higgs model has also recently been shown to be equivalent to the theory of a massive kalb - ramond string interacting with the worldsheet of the vortex in the limit of large higgs coupling and thin core radius @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section two",
    ", we present a solution of  the @xmath14 abelian higgs equations with non - zero winding number @xmath16-dimensional anti de sitter spacetime ( ads@xmath17 ) , and justify that these solutions describe a vortex - line structure .",
    "we then show in section three that this solution induces ( for thin strings and to leading order in the gravitational coupling ) a deficit angle in ads@xmath17 . since this solution has the same local asymptotic behaviour as pure ads@xmath17 , we therefore expect @xcite  that a non - local quantity in the boundary cft will be needed for its holographic description . in section 4",
    "we show this to be the case : we consider the two point correlation function of the dual boundary conformal scalar operator and show that there exists a kink in this correlation function which encodes the mass per unit length of the vortex .",
    "we compute this in section 5 using the boundary counterterm approach , and find the mass density to be uniform .",
    "a concluding section rounds out the paper .",
    "we take the abelian higgs lagrangian in ads@xmath17 as follows ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a complex  scalar klein - gordon field , @xmath20 is the field strength of  the electromagnetic field @xmath21 and @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the covariant derivative .",
    "we employ planck units @xmath24 which implies that the planck mass is equal to one , and write the ads@xmath17 spacetime metric in the form @xmath25    defining the real fields @xmath26 by the following equations    @xmath27    and employing a suitable choice of gauge , one could rewrite the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) and the equations of motion in terms of these fields as : @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the field strength of the corresponding gauge field @xmath31 . note that the real field @xmath32 is not itself a physical quantity .",
    "superficially it appears not to contain any physical information .",
    "however if @xmath32 is not single valued this is no longer the case , and the resultant solutions are referred to as vortex solutions @xcite .  in this case",
    "the requirement that @xmath19 field be single - valued implies that the line integral of @xmath33 over any closed loop is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer . in this case",
    "the flux of electromagnetic field @xmath36passing through such a closed loop is quantized with quanta @xmath37    we seek a vortex solution for the abelian higgs lagrangian ( [ lag2 ] ) in the background of ads@xmath17.this solution can be interpreted as a string like object in the background metric ( [ adsmetr1 ] ) .",
    "we consider the static cylindrically symmetric case with the gauge choice , @xmath38 where @xmath39 goes from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , corresponding to the coordinates @xmath42 in the metric ( [ adsmetr1 ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eqmo2 ] ) are @xmath43    @xmath44    we seek a cylindrically symmetric solution , one for which @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "we thus obtain the following equations of motion @xmath47 @xmath48 as expected , in the limit @xmath49 , the equations ( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) reduce to those whose solutions describe the well known nielsen - olesen vortex in flat spacetime . in this case",
    "the solution for the gauge field is represented by a combination of bessel functions which at large distance decay exponentially .",
    "exact analytical solutions to the above equations ( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) are not known .",
    "however if we assume that @xmath50  becomes constant at large @xmath51 , @xmath52 , which is the necessary condition to have a vortex line solution , then we are able to analytically solve ( [ eqa ] ) for the gauge field , obtaining @xmath53 where the function @xmath54 is given by    @xmath55    and@xmath56  is the usual hypergeometric function .  to obtain the behaviour of solution ( [ asoln ] ) in the limit @xmath57",
    ", one may use the following relation between the hypergeometric function and the bessel function , @xmath58 in which @xmath59 and @xmath60 could go to infinity through real or complex values @xcite .    the solution ( [ asoln ] ) for the gauge potential then reduces to a combination of the bessel functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 . by a suitable choice of constants of integration @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant and @xmath67 is the hankel function of order one , which in the large @xmath68 limit has the well behaved decaying exponential form analogous to that observed in @xcite .    the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath69 , which is given by @xmath70 is @xmath71 again by using eq .",
    "( [ golden ] ) one could show that as @xmath72 goes to infinity , the above solution reduces to @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the hankel function of order zero . the above relation ( [ hiinf ] ) is the same as that of the magnetic field obtained for the string in the flat spacetime . in this case in the large @xmath68 limit the magnetic field ( [ hiinf ] ) is approximately @xmath75 consider next the behaviour of the magnetic field @xmath76 given by equation ( [ hfield ] ) as a function of the distance from the string .",
    "for values of @xmath77 , and different values of  the cosmological constant , @xmath78 goes to zero very rapidly as @xmath68 goes to infinity , as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the characteristic length is defined to be a distance from the string axis which measures the region in spacetime over which the magnitude of @xmath76 is appreciably different from zero . from fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , we see that the characteristic length does not depend on the cosmological constant and therefore one could consider the characteristic length to be the same as the case of  large @xmath72 , which from equation ( [ hinf ] ) is equal to @xmath79    next we study the behaviour of the magnitude of the scalar field @xmath80 eq.([eqx ] ) is approximately satisfied if @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the minimum of the potential in ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "this minimum is just the vacuum value of the field configuration . denoting fluctuations about this vacuum value by @xmath83    @xmath84    and expanding the potential in the lagrangian about @xmath85 we have from eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) , @xmath86 where in deriving ( [ flucinf ] ) from ( [ eqx ] ) , we have neglected terms of order unity in the coefficients of the first and second terms involving derivatives of the @xmath50 field with respect to the terms involving @xmath87 .    from ( [ flucinf ] ) the approximate solution to eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) for large @xmath51 is @xmath88 figure ( [ fig2 ] ) illustrates the behaviour of @xmath89 for different values of @xmath72 which is obtained by solving the field equations numerically .    as with the magnetic field ,",
    "the @xmath50  field is nearly equal to its vacuum value @xmath90 everywhere except within a certain region @xmath91 , which defines a characteristic length for this field .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath92 for @xmath93 and so the characteristic length @xmath94  is of the order of  @xmath95 . from  figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    ", we see that the value of @xmath94  is nearly independent of @xmath96  it is easily seen that if the order of magnitude of @xmath94 and @xmath97 are nearly equal to each other , then one has a well defined vortex line , or string .",
    "so the vacuum state is described by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and the extension of the string is given by @xmath100  as one can see from figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , the value of@xmath101  is nearly equal to @xmath82 for  @xmath68 greater than some @xmath68 which has the same order as @xmath102 .",
    "this shows that we can have a vortex solution for the field equations .",
    "we now consider the effect of  the vortex on the ads@xmath17 spacetime .",
    "this entails finding the solutions of the coupled einstein - abelian higgs differential equations in ads@xmath17 .",
    "this is a formidable problem even for flat spacetime , and no exact solutions have been found  for the flat spacetime yet .",
    "howeverwe can obtain some physical results by making judicious approximations .",
    "first , we assume that the thickness of string is much smaller that all the other relevant length scales .",
    "second , we assume that the gravitational effects of the string are weak enough so that the linearized einstein - abelian higgs differential equations are applicable",
    ".    for convenience , in this section we use the following form of the metric of ads@xmath103    @xmath104    in the absence of the vortex , we must have @xmath105 , yielding @xmath106 which is the metric for pure ads@xmath17 .",
    "the transformation relations between two metrics ( [ adsmetr1 ] ) and ( [ adsmetr3 ] ) are @xmath107    using the transformation @xmath108 ( which in fact is equal to @xmath46 ) it is straightforward to show that the abelian higgs equations in the background metric ( [ adsmetr3 ] ) are simply equations ( [ eqa ] , [ eqx ] ) . employing the two assumptions concerning the thickness of the vortex core and its weak gravitational field , we solve the einstein field equations @xmath109 to this order of approximation by taking @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is given by ( [ adsmetr3 ] ) , @xmath112 includes the corrections which induce non - zero @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 in ( [ adsmetrgen ] ) by taking the energy - momentum tensor @xmath116 to be that associated with the solution ( [ asoln ] ) and ( [ xinf ] ) .",

    "one can easily find that if the angle @xmath185 is less than the critical polar angle , namely @xmath251 , then the geodesics do not pass through the wedge @xmath252 in this case , the length of geodesics should be computed in @xmath237 , which is equal to ( [ len ] ) . on the other hand , if the angle @xmath185 is greater than the critical value @xmath246 , then the geodesics intersect the edges of the wedge and we must use the coordinate system @xmath249 , which the length of geodesic is given by replacing @xmath253 in ( [ len ] ) .    * *    hence there will be a discontinuity in the logarithmic derivative of the correlation function just in the neighborhood of @xmath254 the amount of this discontinuity is @xmath255 where as mentioned above , @xmath256 is some constant @xmath257 , which could be set equal to @xmath258 .",
    "although the correlation function depends on @xmath259 , the magnitude of the kink is independent of this quantity .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "in this section we compute the mass of the vortex , which is equivalent to the mass of ads@xmath17 with a deficit angle of @xmath260 .",
    "we choose a two - dimensional manifold @xmath261 , which is the boundary of the poincar ball at @xmath195 , or @xmath262 .",
    "the boundary stress tensor is @xmath263 where @xmath264is the induced metric on the boundary of ads@xmath17 ( @xmath265ads@xmath17 ) , located at @xmath195 with extrinsic curvature @xmath266 .",
    "the counterterm action @xmath267 is given by @xcite @xmath268 which , when added to the usual einstein - hilbert action of ads - gravity , removes its divergences at @xmath269 .",
    "the mass is given by @xcite    @xmath270    where @xmath271 is the timelike normal unit vector to the boundary @xmath272 with the metric @xmath273 , and defines the local arrow of time on the boundary of ads@xmath119 .",
    "@xmath274 is the time - like killing vector of ads@xmath17 .    the deficit angle in the ads@xmath119space yields a singular structure in the induced ricci scalar of the boundary @xmath261 .",
    "these conical singularity structures are due to the identification of the edges of the wedge at the points @xmath226 and @xmath227 on the @xmath261 . to handle these singularities ,  we replace the boundary @xmath261 with a sequence of  regular manifolds @xcite .",
    "the first and second regular manifolds @xmath275 , @xmath276 are regulated manifolds corresponding to the @xmath277 , @xmath278 which are two dimensional spaces with the topology of a cone in the neighborhood of the poles of the boundary @xmath261 .",
    "the third manifold is @xmath279 @xmath280 , which can be smoothly matched to the other two . on the manifolds @xmath281 , @xmath278 ,",
    "the metric is , @xmath282 where the polar coordinate @xmath185 is restricted to the interval @xmath283.$ ] we take the following form of the metric for the regular manifolds  @xmath275 , @xmath276 ,   @xmath284^{2}\\}d\\theta ^{2}+r_{0}^{2}\\theta ^{2}d\\varphi ^{2 }   \\label{conregmetr}\\ ] ]    in the above equation , @xmath285 is a function which is introduced to smooth off the tips of the cones ,  and is subject to the following conditions , @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the regulator parameter . by choosing an appropriate function form of @xmath288 @xcite ,",
    "it is easy to show that the ricci scalar @xmath289 of the boundary @xmath261 with conical singularities at @xmath226  and @xmath227 is   @xmath290 in the above relation , @xmath291 is the ricci scalar of the manifold @xmath292 @xmath280 and the dirac delta function is subject to the following normalization , @xmath293    putting these together , ( [ mass ] ) gives for the mass of ads@xmath17 , containing a wedge , @xmath294 in agreement with ( [ massdef ] ) in the limit that the thickness @xmath95 of the string is negligible .",
    "we have solved the nielsen - olesen equations in an ads@xmath17 background , and found that the higgs and gauge fields are axially symmetric , with non - zero winding number .",
    "our solution in the limit of  large @xmath72 ( small cosmological constant ) reduces to the well known flat - space @xcite , and has well - defined characteristic lengths @xmath295 and @xmath296 outside of which the fields exponentially approach their asymptotic values .",
    "the solution ( to leading order in the gravitational coupling ) induces a deficit angle in ads@xmath297 .",
    "we find these results compelling enough to interpret our solution as a vortex .    the holographic detection of a nielsen - olesen vortex is now obtained by comparing eqs . ( [ kinkcft ] ) and ( [ totmass ] ) .",
    "although the total mass of the vortex is infinite , the mass per unit length is finite , and we can relate this to the kink ( [ kinkcft ] ) in the correlation function computed above . since the kink depends only on the deficit angle @xmath244 , therefore for a fixed @xmath298 the kink is constant . on the other hand mass density",
    "also depends only on @xmath244 , and therefore one could interpret the value of the kink as the mass per unit length . from ( [ totmass ] ) , the mass per unit length is equal to @xmath299 , *  * and we obtain @xmath300 for the relationship between the vortex mass density and the kink in the cft correlation function .",
    "the winding number of the vortex also has a holographic description .",
    "the field @xmath19 in ( [ xpomegadef ] ) has the same phase as its limiting field at the boundary of ads@xmath17 .",
    "consequently the winding number of the vortex is given by the line - integral of the corresponding one - point function about any loop which encloses @xmath226 on the @xmath15-dimensional boundary .",
    "of course another holographic effect of the vortex is to induce conical singularities in the boundary at @xmath301  .",
    "the holographic interpretation is that the boundary cft is formulated on a space that has a conical deficit .",
    "however note that the presence of such singularities need not imply the presence of a kink in the correlation function .",
    "it is this kink  present at any latitude of the boundary spacetime  that signals the presence of a vortex .",
    "our results are commensurate with those of ref .",
    "@xcite :  non - local properties of the two point correlation function in the dual conformal field theory ( the kink , in this case ) probe the interior of the bulk geometry . we have considered only the two point function of the operator on the boundary which is dual to the scalar field @xmath19  in the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) .  as we have seen , this correlation function is related to the mass density of the vortex .",
    "an understanding of the role of the other two , three and four points correlation functions remains to be carried out , along with a more detailed study of the vortex itself , including obtaining a holographic description of its interior structure , and of threading it through a black hole .",
    "work on these problems is in progress .",
