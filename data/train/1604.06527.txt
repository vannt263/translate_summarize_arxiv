    "the twin pillars of quantum field theory are locality and unitarity .",
    "these fundamental properties persist after wick rotation : locality manifests as factorization laws for correlation functions and unitarity manifests as reflection positivity . in the late 1980 s",
    "a mathematical axiom system for wick - rotated quantum field theory on compact manifolds was introduced for scale - independent theories , by segal  @xcite for 2-dimensional conformal field theories and by atiyah  @xcite for topological field theories . with modifications these axioms",
    "are now believed to be relevant to scale - dependent theories as well . in this framework",
    "a quantum field theory is a linear representation of a _",
    "bordism category_. the latter categorifies thom s bordism groups  @xcite , and a field theory categorifies integer - valued bordism invariants , such as the signature of a compact oriented manifold .",
    "locality is encoded in the composition of morphisms  the gluing of bordisms along codimension one submanifolds .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to implement reflection positivity as well . in the early 1990 s , especially motivated by 3-dimensional chern - simons theory ,",
    "an _ extended _ notion of locality was introduced by gluing bordisms with corners along higher codimension submanifolds , and this led naturally to formulations involving higher categories ; see  @xcite , for example .",
    "a natural question arises : what is the extended notion of reflection positivity which goes with extended locality ?",
    "we offer a solution in a very special case : invertible topological field theories .",
    "such theories have long been known to be maps out of madsen - tillmann bordism spectra , and our main result brings us full circle back to the bordism spectra introduced by thom in his thesis  @xcite .",
    "[ thm:110 ] there is a 1:1 correspondence @xmath0{\\mstrut _ { \\textnormal{tor}}}.\\ ] ]    the right hand side is the torsion subgroup of homotopy classes of maps from a thom spectrum to a shift of the anderson dual to the sphere spectrum .",
    "spectra are the main characters in stable homotopy theory , a field which partly grew out of thom s work , and there are standard computational techniques which we employ in the latter part of this paper to illustrate the efficacy of the theorem",
    ". often field theories are classified by enumerating lagrangians with specified background and fluctuating fields which are consistent with a given symmetry group .",
    "by contrast , theorem  [ thm:110 ] is a direct _ quantum _ classification of correlation functions and state spaces , as encoded by the axiom system ; the only inputs are the spacetime dimension  @xmath1 and the wick - rotated vector symmetry group . in general",
    "there is a homomorphism @xmath2 whose image includes  @xmath3 ; the kernel consists of internal global symmetries .",
    "there is a unique associated stable symmetry group  @xmath4 independent of dimension , as we prove in theorem  [ thm:6 ] . ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm:110 ] in   [ subsec:7.2 ] .",
    "there is a stronger assertion which remains conjectural in this paper : the abelian group of deformation classes of _ all _ reflection positive invertible field theories , including those which are not topological , is obtained by simply omitting ` tor ' on the right hand side of  .",
    "we make some comments about this generalization in   [ subsec:4.4 ] and remark  [ thm:144 ] ; we use it in the computations of   [ sec:8 ] .",
    "we remark that for general reasons nontorsion only arises if the spacetime dimension  @xmath1 is odd .",
    "a strong motivation and immediate application come from condensed matter physics , where a topical issue is classification of topological phases of matter .",
    "one can envision a moduli space of quantum mechanical theories with fixed dimension and symmetry group , and the assumption of an _ energy gap _ may give rise to theories not connected by a path .",
    "the path components of the parameter space ",
    "deformation classes of gapped quantum systems  are the topological phases .",
    "we invoke without proof two physical principles to pass from these quantum mechanical systems , typically defined on discrete lattices , to continuum field theories :    1 .   the deformation class of a quantum system is determined by its low energy behavior ; 2 .   the low energy physics of a _ gapped _",
    "system is well - approximated by a _ _ topological__. ] field theory .",
    "it is desirable to have a mathematical treatment of these principles .",
    "we also implicitly assume an emergent relativistic symmetry in the sense that the effective field theory is defined on compact @xmath1-manifolds without requiring local or global splittings into products of time and space .",
    "we restrict to a special class of lattice models , often called _ short - range entangled _ or _ symmetry protected topological _ ( spt ) phases , for which the long - range effective topological field theory is _",
    "invertible_. early discussions of this property may be found in  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm:110 ] provides a uniform solution to the desired classification , assuming that every possible deformation class of invertible topological theory can be realized by a lattice model .",
    "we emphasize that this answer is algorithmic : given a spacetime dimension  @xmath1 and a symmetry group  @xmath5 the right hand side of   is the group of topological phases .",
    "we provide concrete evidence for this application of theorem  [ thm:110 ] : in   [ subsec:8.2 ] we undertake detailed computations for fermionic systems and compare to results in the physics literature , the latter derived by means of physical arguments .",
    "some readers may wish to examine our tables of computations before tackling the more theoretical parts of the paper .",
    "in unpublished work kitaev  @xcite develops a classification of short - range entangled phases based on microscopic considerations , and he too is led to stable homotopy theory and results consonant with our effective field theory classification .",
    "kapustin  @xcite initiated computations of topological phases via character groups of bordism groups , and he used them and subsequent computations , for example  @xcite , as phenomenological evidence for a general classification along these lines .",
    "gaiotto - kapustin  @xcite , following on gu - wen  @xcite , show that some invertible fermionic phases defined by lattice models are characterized by spin bordism groups .",
    "a previous paper  @xcite by the first author contains much exposition and computations about this application of field theory to condensed matter physics , but the treatment of unitarity is incomplete and relativistic invariance is not assumed .    a second theme of this paper , after extended reflection positivity , is the study of symmetry groups in relativistic quantum field theory , and that is where we begin in   [ sec:12 ] .",
    "our starting point is a theory on @xmath1-dimensional minkowski spacetime with global symmetry group  @xmath6 , after dividing out by translations .",
    "the analytic continuations of correlation functions , which exist as a consequence of positivity of energy , are symmetric under the complex lie group  @xmath7 , and the entire wick - rotated theory is symmetric under the compact real form  @xmath8 which appears on the left hand side of  .",
    "our arguments use the rigidity of compact lie groups to constrain possible symmetry groups . the main result in this section ( theorem  [ thm:6 ] )",
    "is the existence and uniqueness of a stabilization  @xmath4 , which is the group in the thom spectrum on the right hand side of  .",

    "sec:2 ] we formulate reflection symmetry in terms of a group extension @xmath9 ; elements in  @xmath10 are a wick - rotated analog of antiunitary symmetries in quantum mechanics .",
    "we use this extension in   [ subsec:3.1 ] to define an involution on the bordism category of @xmath5-manifolds . in the basic case @xmath11 the involution is orientation - reversal , and our uniform treatment gives analogs for any symmetry group . for example , fermionic theories with time - reversal symmetry ( and no other symmetry ) have  @xmath12 : the involution takes a pin structure to its `` @xmath13-flipped '' pin structure .",
    "three basic lessons we learned about reflection positivity : ( i )  ` reflection ' and ` positivity ' are distinct ; ( ii )  ` reflection ' is a structure whereas ` positivity ' is a condition ; and ( iii )  ` extended positivity ' is a structure , not a condition . in the axiom system",
    "a field theory is defined to be a homomorphism  a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath14 from the bordism category to the category of complex vector spaces and linear maps .",
    "a _ reflection structure _  (  [ subsec:3.3 ] ) is equivariance data for  @xmath15 with respect to the generalized orientation - reversal involution on  @xmath16 and the involution of complex conjugation on  @xmath17 .",
    "( we briefly review involutions on categories and equivariant functors in appendix  [ sec:11 ] . )",
    "a reflection structure induces a hermitian metric on the vector space of states attached to an @xmath18-manifold , and _",
    "positivity _ is the condition that these hermitian structures be positive definite .",
    "analogous to reflection positivity in euclidean space  (  [ subsec:2.2 ] ) we see that the partition function of the _",
    "double _ of a manifold with boundary must be positive in order that a reflection structure be positive .",
    "our treatment of this material using general symmetry groups means it applies to all theories , including those with time - reversal symmetry and fermions which , after wick rotation , involve nonorientable manifolds with pin structure .    to proceed to",

    "( invertible field theories were singled out in  @xcite in an application to string theory . ) in   [ subsec:4.2 ] we review how invertibility catalyzes a transition to stable homotopy theory : the analog of   for an invertible topological field theory is a map of spectra .",
    "the domain is the invertible quotient of a higher bordism category , a madsen - tillmann spectrum",
    ". there is freedom to choose the codomain spectrum , and in   [ subsec:4.3 ] we introduce two universal choices .",
    "the first is the _ pontrjagin dual _  @xmath19 to the sphere spectrum , which is used to track topological theories on the nose : theories with unequal partition functions are distinct .",
    "the second universal target spectrum is the _ anderson dual _",
    "@xmath20 to the sphere spectrum .",
    "it tracks deformation classes of invertible theories rather than individual theories .",
    "significantly , in the spirit of `` derived geometry '' , that classification includes invertible theories which are not topological ; the topological theories have finite order . for",
    "the application to topological phases one should include the nontopological theories , as they incorporate nonzero thermal hall response .",
    "an example is kitaev s @xmath21  phase  @xcite .",
    "see   [ subsec:4.4 ] for a general discussion .",
    "the main arguments about _ extended positivity _ occur in   [ sec:6 ] and   [ sec:7 ] .",
    "madsen - tillmann spectra filter thom spectra , which leads to a notion of a _",
    "stable _ invertible topological field theory : a map out of a thom spectrum .",
    "there is a basic link between nonextended positivity and stability , which we establish in theorem  [ thm:78 ] and theorem  [ thm:82 ] using obstruction theory arguments .",
    "this results in an intermediate classification ( corollary  [ thm:86 ] ) of invertible topological theories with reflection structure satisfying nonextended positivity . to address extended positivity",
    "we begin in   [ sec:7 ] by reformulating the positivity of hermitian metrics in categorical terms as a splitting of the inclusion of fixed points under the `` bar star '' involution .",
    "bar star has an analog on the spectra in question , and in   [ subsec:7.2 ] we define the analogous splitting as a _ positivity structure _ on an extended invertible theory with a reflection structure .",
    "manipulations in equivariant stable homotopy theory then lead quickly to a proof of theorem  [ thm:110 ] . interestingly , a positivity structure is a trivialization of a `` real '' field theory of dimension  @xmath22 , as we explain in remark  [ thm:111 ] , and this could provide a starting point for investigating the noninvertible case , which we hope to pursue in the future .",
    "the third main subject of this paper is what might be called the homotopy theory of relativistic free fermions .",
    "there are two distinct scenarios in which free fermions give rise to a deformation class of @xmath1-dimensional reflection positive invertible theories .",
    "first scenario : an @xmath18-dimensional free fermion theory has an associated @xmath1-dimensional invertible anomaly theory , which is not necessarily topological ; our concern here is its deformation class .- theory , whereas its deformation class lies in topological @xmath23-theory . ]",
    "second scenario : an @xmath1-dimensional _ massive _ free fermion theory has a long - range effective invertible topological field theory approximation , according to the general principle  ( ii ) invoked above , but now applied to a field theory rather than a lattice system .",
    "we sketch the first scenario in some detail in   [ subsec:8.4 ] , culminating in a formula ( conjecture  [ thm:124 ] ) for the deformation class of the anomaly theory . since massive free fermions have trivial anomaly , the starting point is the group of free fermionic data under direct sum modulo massive free fermionic data .",
    "the existence of a mass term has a meaning in terms of clifford modules ( lemma  [ thm:119 ] ) , and this produces an identification of the quotient by massive theories in terms of the homotopy groups of the @xmath23-theory spectrum ( theorem  [ thm:120 ] ) .",
    "the formula for the associated anomaly theory is a composition of the atiyah - bott - shapiro map  @xcite from thom bordism to @xmath23-theory and the anderson self - duality isomorphism of @xmath23-theory  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed sketch of these ideas ; we hope to give a thorough mathematical treatment in the future . by contrast , we only comment briefly (  [ subsubsec:8.4.6 ] ) on the second scenario , beginning from a massive @xmath1-dimensional free fermion theory , enough to show that the starting and ending data match those in the first scenario .",
    "there is a huge literature on relativistic free fermion field theories and associated anomalies ; the recent paper  @xcite , which describes several particular cases in detail , provided motivation and guidance for the general story here .    to enable detailed comparisons with the physics literature we carry out the discussion of relativistic free fermions for 10  cases simultaneously . to enumerate them we resume group theoretical arguments in   [ subsec:8.1 ] to classify relativistic symmetry groups",

    "they include  @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and semidirect products with the various unit scalars .",
    "this `` relativistic 10-fold way '' is a variation on the nonrelativistic case , which is described in many works : a sample includes  @xcite .",
    "our uniform treatment is based on lemma  [ thm:90 ] , which embeds each symmetry group in a clifford algebra .",
    "usual constructions with clifford modules  the atiyah - bott - shapiro - thom class , dirac operators and their indices  then generalize easily . there is a purely geometric application : index theory on pin and @xmath30  manifolds is straightforward using this embedding .    the results of the homotopy theory computations are reported in   [ subsec:8.2 ] .",
    "we provide a table for each of the 10  fermionic symmetry groups . in each spacetime dimension",
    "@xmath31 we compute the group of free fermion theories ( theorem  [ thm:120 ] ) , the group of deformation classes of interacting theories ( theorem  [ thm:110 ] ) , and the map between them ( conjecture  [ thm:124 ] ) .",
    "we make comparisons with the condensed matter literature where available and find almost total agreement ; in the few cases with a discrepancy we motivate a reexamination of the physics assertions . in   [ sec:13 ] we outline how the calculations are done and supply ext charts which encode the @xmath32-term of the relevant adams spectral sequences .",
