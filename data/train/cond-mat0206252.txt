    "the first studies of quantized vorticity involved rotating a sample of @xmath0he at constant angular velocity , and resulted in an ordered array of vortices aligned along the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "quantized vortices can also be created by applying a thermal counterflow @xcite , in which the vortices form an irregular , disordered tangle of lines .",
    "there has been only one experiment that we are aware of in which these two methods of producing vortices are combined @xcite .",
    "the experiment suggests that there exists a form of steady rotating turbulence , characterized by a certain vortex line density at given counterflow velocity @xmath1 and angular velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine numerically in the first place whether such a state of rotating turbulence exists .",
    "we assume the model of schwarz @xcite in which a quantized vortex line is described as a parametric form @xmath3 .",
    "then the velocity of a point @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is determined by the fully non - local biot savart law , and @xmath7 is the temperature - dependent friction coefficient .",
    "the numerical simulation is performed in a cubic box of volume @xmath8 @xmath9 in a rotating frame at angular velocity @xmath10 at temperature @xmath111.6 k. we assume periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath12 direction and rigid boundary conditions at the side walls .",
    "we calculate the dynamics of vortices at @xmath13 hz and @xmath14 cm / s ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .",
    "we create an initial vortex array ( fig .",
    "1a ) which consists of 8 vortices parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "we added very small random perturbations to the initial configuration of vortices ( of rms amplitude 0.01 cm ) to simulate thermal or mechanical noise .",
    "the perturbations undergo the glaberson instability @xcite and kelvin waves ( helical displacements of the vortex cores ) become unstable and grow , as shown in fig .",
    "the randomness of the initial perturbations prevents the locking of the phases of these growing waves .",
    "figure 2 shows that the vortex line density @xmath15 grows exponentially , as predicted by glaberson _",
    "et al . _ , starting from its initial value @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "soon the helical waves reconnect with each other ( fig .",
    "1c ) and a vortex tangle is formed ( see fig .",
    "1d ) , reaching a saturated value of the vortex line density @xmath18 @xmath17 as seen in fig .",

    "3 . at @xmath21 @xmath22 because all lines are in the rotation direction .",
    "as the vortex array is randomized by the glaberson instability and the resulting reconnections , @xmath22 decreases from one as the tangle builds up in intensity .",
    "it is however apparent that when a steady state is reached the vortex tangle , although apparently random ( see fig .",
    "1d ) , possesses a definite polarization @xmath23 .",
    "this result supports the interpretation of the experiment given by swanson _",
    ", that superfluid turbulence can be polarized .",
    "we have studied numerically the vortex dynamics under both rotation and counterflow .",
    "we find that the initial rotating array is made unstable by a counterflow velocity as predicted by glaberson _",
    "et al . _ , and that , after many reconnections , a vortex tangle is formed .",
    "the tangle , apparently random , actually possesses a definite polarization .",
