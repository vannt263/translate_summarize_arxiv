    "the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction is responsible for many interesting and important phenomena , especially when it comes into play with the magnetism .",
    "the typical examples in solids include the orbital magnetization , magnetocrystalline anisotropy , magneto - optical activity , etc.@xcite the so interaction can also contribute to the magnetically induced inversion symmetry breaking in multiferroics , which has attracted an enormous amount of attention over the last decade.@xcite    in many applications , the so interaction can be regarded to be small and treated as a perturbation . for instance , the so interaction is usually much smaller than the bandwidth in the vast majority of magnetic @xmath5 compounds .",
    "the @xmath5-level splitting , which is often caused by crystal distortions of a nonrelativistic origin , can be also substantially larger than the so interaction .",
    "the typical example of phenomena , which are treated perturbatively is the orbital magnetization , appearing in the first order of the so coupling , and the uniaxial anisotropy , appearing in the second order . in many cases",
    ", the perturbative treatment can be sufficient from the viewpoint of numerical accuracy .",
    "it also provides a clear microscopic picture underlying the considered phenomena .",
    "nevertheless , the situation is severely complicated in the many - electron case : the so coupling will polarize the electron system , giving rise to the new terms , which arise from the electron - electron interactions and additionally contribute to the perturbation theory expansion , formally in the same order of the so coupling .",
    "it can be well seen in the one - electron theories , where the search of the magnetic ground state is reduced to the self - consistent solution of ene - electron equations with the effective kohn - sham - like potential @xmath0:@xcite the external perturbation @xmath6 ( in our case  the so interaction ) produces some change of @xmath0 , which can contribute to the magnetic properties in the same order of @xmath6 and which should be found self - consistently .",
    "such a situation occurs , for instance , in the one - electron hartree - fock ( hf ) theory or in the commonly used kohn - sham density - functional theory ( dft ) and its various modifications.@xcite    the perturbative treatment of the so interaction is widely used in electronic structure calculations based on dft . for instance , it was employed for the analysis of orbital magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy,@xcite antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions,@xcite etc .",
    "most of such calculations are supplemented with the frozen potential approximation ( fpa ) , where the effect of the so coupling is evaluated for some fixed potential @xmath0 ( typically , obtained without so coupling ) .",
    "however , the validity of this strategy crucially depends on the form of exchange - correlation potential .",
    "if it is smooth , as in the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) , which is based on the theory of homogeneous electron gas , the fpa works reasonably well : the lsda potential is nearly spherical near atomic sites and only weakly depends on the orbital variables .",
    "another factor , which justifies the use of the fpa is the additional spherical average of the potential inside atomic spheres ( the so - called atomic sphere approximation or asa ) in the linear muffin - tin orbitals method.@xcite    nevertheless , it is commonly accepted today that the lsda itself is inadequate for treating the orbital magnetization and other so interaction related properties , where one essential points is to consider the explicit orbital dependence of the exchange - correlation energy , which is missing in lsda.@xcite this is rather old problem , which is also known as the treatment of the ` orbital polarization ' or ` population imbalance ' in the electronic structure calculations.@xcite however , fpa is incompatible with the orbital polarization , which assumes an explicit and sometimes rather strong orbital dependence of the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "thus , even though the so interaction is small , in the latter case we are typically forced to run full - scale self - consistent calculations with some orbital - dependent potential .    although we do not consider it in the present study , another important direction is the refinement of the theory of orbital magnetization for extended periodic systems , which brings a number of new and interesting ideas to this field.@xcite    in this article , we present the theory of self - consistent linear response ( sclr ) for the so interaction related properties .",
    "this is also a perturbation theory with respect to the so interaction , which allows us to get rid of numerical self - consistency in the process of solution of one - electron kohn - sham - like equations , and to formulate this step analytically , similar to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the screened coulomb interaction.@xcite we will introduce our method for the unrestricted hf solution of the low - energy model , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations in the wannier basis.@xcite however , it can be generalized and applied for other types of electronic structure calculations , such as lda@xmath2@xmath7,@xcite hybrid functionals,@xcite etc . , where the search of the magnetic ground state is reduced to the solution of an auxiliary one - electron problem with the orbital - dependent exchange - correlation potential .",
    "it should be noted that the idea itself is not new and was discussed in the context of magnetic anisotropy calculations in the anderson model already in 1960s.@xcite however , it it practically forgotten today , despite its fruitfulness and importance in the field of electronic structure calculations .",
    "we will generalize this approach and derive an analytical expression for the self - consistent density matrix and the effective potential @xmath0 in the first order of the so coupling , being affected by the on - site coulomb interactions and the crystal field of an arbitrary form . with this approach",
    ", we will be able to access the behavior of the orbital magnetization or any other property , which appears in the first order of the so coupling . then",
    ", due to variational character of the total energy and the powerful @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 theorem,@xcite the sclr theory will enable us to obtain the energy change up to the third order of the so coupling  the property , which is extremely useful for the analysis of magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( ma ) energy .",
    "moreover , by knowing self - consistent potential @xmath0 , one can derive all kind of properties in the first order of the so coupling from the single particle energies , by employing the magnetic force theorem.@xcite we will use this approach in order to calculate parameters of antisymmetric dm interactions ( ref .  ) and , on the basis of these parameters , to discuss the spin canting in distorted transition - metal perovskite oxides . we will show that parameters of interatomic magnetic interactions , obtained in such a way , reproduce nearly perfectly results of self - consistent electronic structure calculations with the so coupling .",
    "the ability of the proposed method will be illustrated on a number of example , including the spin canting in ytio@xmath4 and lamno@xmath4 , formation of the spin - spiral order in bifeo@xmath4 , and magnetic control of ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization in multiferroic bimno@xmath4 , where the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking gives rise not only to the fe activity , but also produces finite dm interactions across the inversion centers , which are responsible for the ferromagnetism .",

    "the effective low - energy model is regarded as a bridge between first - principles electronic structure calculations and the model hamiltonian approach . with the proper construction",
    ", the model reproduces results of first - principles calculations , at least on a semi - quantitative level .",
    "moreover , the model allows us to treat the problem of electron correlations beyond conventional approximations employed in the first - principles calculations . in this section ,",
    "we briefly remind the reader the main ideas of the construction of the model hamiltonian .",
    "the details can be found in the review article ( ref .  ) and in previous publications.@xcite    the model hamiltonian , @xmath9 is formulated in the basis of wannier orbitals @xmath10 , which are constructed for the magnetically active bands near the fermi level . here , each greek symbol ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 ) stands for the combination of spin ( @xmath15@xmath16 @xmath2 or @xmath17 ) and orbital ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 ) indices : for instance , @xmath22 , etc .",
    "each lattice point @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is specified by the position @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) of the atomic site in the primitive cell and the lattice translation @xmath27 .",
    "the model is constructed starting from the electronic band structure in the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the first step is the construction of localized wannier basis for the magnetically active bands.@xcite each basis orbital @xmath28 is labeled by the combined index @xmath11 and centered around some lattice point @xmath29@xmath2@xmath30 . in our case , the wannier function were generated using the projector - operator technique ( ref .  ) and orthonormal basis orbitals of the lmto method ( ref .  ) as the trial wave functions .",
    "as the lmto basis functions are already well localized , typically such procedure allows us to generate well localized wannier functions .",
    "then , the one - electron part of the model is identified with the matrix elements of lda hamiltonian ( @xmath31 ) in the wannier basis : @xmath32 . since the wannier basis is complete in the low - energy part of the spectrum , the construction is exact in the sense that the band structure , obtained from @xmath33 , exactly coincides with the one of lda .    the wannier basis and",
    "the one - electron parameters @xmath34 were first computed without so interaction . in this case , the matrix elements do not depend on the spin indices : @xmath35 .",
    "after that , matrix elements of the so interaction were calculated at each atomic site in the same ` nonrelativistic ' basis of wannier orbitals : @xmath36 , as explained in ref .  .",
    "in the regular hf calculations , these matrix elements are combined with the previously computed ` nonrelativistic ' @xmath34 , while in sclr this part is treated as the external perturbation @xmath6 .",
    "matrix elements of screened coulomb interactions at some atomic site @xmath25 can be also calculated in the wannier basis .",
    "for the purposes of our work , it is convenient to adopt the following notations : @xmath37 the screened coulomb interaction @xmath38 can be computed by employing the constrained rpa technique.@xcite in this case , @xmath38 does not depend on spin variables and @xmath39 .",
    "since the constrained rpa technique is very time consuming , we apply additional approximations , which were discussed in ref .  .",
    "namely , first we evaluate the screened coulomb and exchange interactions between atomic @xmath5 orbitals , using fast and more suitable for these purposes constrained lda technique .",
    "after that , we consider additional channel of screening caused by the @xmath40 transitions in the framework of constrained rpa technique and projecting corresponding polarization function onto the @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "the so obtained parameters of coulomb interactions are well consistent with results of full - scale constrained rpa calculations.@xcite    parameters of model hamiltonian for ytio@xmath4 , lamno@xmath4 , and bimno@xmath4 were already discussed in the previous publications ( refs .   for ytio@xmath4 , ref .   for lamno@xmath4 , and ref .   for bimno@xmath4 ) .",

    "alternatively , one can control the polarization by the magnetic fields , which is coupled to the fm magnetization : the increase of the fm magnetization should suppress the polarization .",

    "we have proposed the sclr method for treating relativistic so interaction in the electronic structure calculations .",
    "this is the first - order perturbation theory , which also takes into account the polarization of the electron system by the so coupling .",
    "the method is an efficient alternative to the straightforward self - consistent solution of kohn - sham - like equations with the so interactions and can be used for the wide class of magnetic compounds , where the so interaction is small compared to other parameters of electronic structure .",
    "the abilities of this method were demonstrated for the solution of effective hubbard - type model in the unrestricted hf approximation .",
    "the model itself was derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations in the wannier basis and is regarded as a good starting point for the analysis of magnetic properties of realistic transition - metal oxides and other strongly correlated systems .",
    "the sclr theory brings a substantial improvement over fpa . the latter approach is widely used in the electronic structure calculations .",
    "it is based on the regular perturbation theory with respect to the so coupling and totally neglects the effect of electron interactions , which can be also affected by the so coupling .",
    "the sclr method becomes especially important when the effective exchange - correlation potential depends explicitly on the orbital variable , which is believed to be crucial for treating the orbital magnetization in electronic structure calculations.@xcite    moreover , the main merits of fpa can be easily transferred to sclr , by replacing the ` bare ' so interaction @xmath6 by the ` screened ' interaction @xmath175 , which takes into account the polarization of the electron system and , thus , incorporates _ all _ the contributions in the first order of the so coupling .",
    "one trivial example is the orbital magnetization , which emerges in the first order of the so coupling and , therefore , is well reproduced by the sclr theory .",
    "another example is the calculation of antisymmetric dm interactions using the magnetic force theorem .",
    "the dm interactions also emerge in the first - order of the so coupling and , in principles , should be accessible by the perturbation theory for the single - particle energies , as prescribed by the magnetic force theorem.@xcite however , in this perturbation theory , it is also important to include all the contributions in the first order of the so coupling .",
    "therefore , the use of sclr substantially improves the description of the dm interactions .",
    "the so obtained parameters of spin hamiltonian appear to be very helpful in the analysis of complex magnetic structures , which can be realized in realistic materials .",
    "another good aspect of sclr is that it can be combined with variational properties of the total energy .",
    "the powerful @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 theorem states in this respect that if one knows the self - consistent potential @xmath0 in the first order of the so coupling ( or any other perturbation ) , one should be able to calculate the corresponding total energy change up to the third order.@xcite this property is very important for compounds with low crystal symmetry .",
    "for instance , one can try to rotate the spin magnetization as the whole and calculate the total energy change caused by the so coupling .",
    "typically such calculations give us the ma energy .",
    "then , what is so special about low - symmetry structures and why is it so important to consider the third - order effects in this case ? indeed , in uniaxial compounds , the ma energy is the second - order effect of the so coupling,@xcite and the second order perturbation theory is typically sufficient for reproducing the corresponding total energy change.@xcite however , when the symmetry is low enough , there will be also the contributions of the dm interactions .",
    "the dm interaction , @xmath145 , itself is of the first order of the so coupling .",
    "it produces the canting of spins , @xmath169 and @xmath154 , also in the first order of the so coupling .",
    "therefore , one can expect the some additional contributions to the ma energy , @xmath242 $ ] in the third order of the so interactions , which are captured by the total energy calculations based on the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 theorem .",
    "other third - order contributions to the total energy are expected from the si anisotropy terms .",
    "these contributions have the following form : @xmath243 , which are finite if the tensor @xmath244 has sufficiently low symmetry : since @xmath168 and @xmath169 are orthogonal , the tensor should have non - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "finally , sclr is a convenient tool for the analysis and interpretation of experimental data and results of electronic structure calculations with the so coupling for magnetic materials .",
    "as was discussed above , many applications for such analysis , which have been earlier developed in the framework of fpa , can be easily adopted for sclr . in this work ,",
    "we have demonstrated how these applications can be used for the analysis of canted magnetic structures in ytio@xmath4 and lamno@xmath4 , spiral magnetic ordering in bifeo@xmath4 , and details of the magnetic inversion breaking in bimno@xmath4 .",
    "the latter application allows us to rationalize several important results , which were earlier predicted in ref .  .",
    "particularly , the inversion symmetry breaking by some complex afm order is typically regarded as the source of the fe activity in improper multiferroics . in this work , we have argued that the afm inversion symmetry breaking can not only induce the fe polarization , but also produce some finite dm interactions , operating across the inversion centers , which may further lead to the fm canting of spins .",
    "thus , one can expect that in some systems , the afm inversion symmetry breaking can be responsible both for the ferroelectricity and the _ ferromagnetism_. this is a very unique situation , which is extremely important from the viewpoint of practical realization of the mutual control of electricity and magnetism .",
    "bimno@xmath4 is the possible candidate , where such a situation could take place .",
    "in this appendix , we consider main contributions to the total energy in the case of the spin - spiral alignment in the noncentrosymmetric @xmath8 phase of bifeo@xmath4 .",
    "it is assumed that the spin - spiral alignment is driven by dm interactions .",
    "let @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 be the basis vectors of a cartesian coordinate frame , which specify the orientation of the spin spiral .",
    "namely , it is assumed that the spin spiral lies in the plane spanned by @xmath245 and @xmath246 , while @xmath247 is perpendicular to this plane .",
    "very generally , these three vectors can be chosen as : @xmath248@xmath249 , @xmath250@xmath251@xmath252 , and @xmath253 .    choosing the phase of the spin spiral such that in the origin @xmath254 , the directions of spins at other sites will be given by @xmath255 then , the energy of dm interactions between nn sites @xmath256 and @xmath23 , @xmath257 $ ] ,",
    "will be given by @xmath258 where @xmath259 and @xmath260 corresponds to the collinear g - type afm alignment , where @xmath261 for all nn bonds . in order to obtain the total energy ,",
    "one should sum up the above expression over all six nn bonds around @xmath256 .",
    "in such a construction , the total energy is given per two fe sites .",
    "all bonds are connected by the symmetry operations of the space group @xmath8 , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : bifeo3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.bifeo3 ] .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath262 where @xmath263 ( the unity ) , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266@xmath267 , @xmath268@xmath269 , and @xmath270@xmath271 . then , using the explicit matrix form for @xmath272 and @xmath273@xmath267 , which acts on the vectors of dm interactions , one can obtain the following expression : @xmath274_z [ \\boldsymbol{r } \\times \\boldsymbol{d}]_z , \\label{eqn : adm}\\ ] ] where @xmath275 and @xmath276 refer to the bond @xmath256-@xmath3 or to any other nn bond .",

    "noting that @xmath295 ( @xmath134 being an integer number ) , the above expression can be further transformed to @xmath296 then , the change of the si anisotropy energy is obtained by averaging the second term over all possible angles between @xmath297 and @xmath298 . for the homogeneous spin spiral , the phase @xmath299 changes by an equal amount between neighboring lattice points .",
    "moreover , for small @xmath298 , the summation over discrete angles can be replaced by integration , which yields for the change of the si anisotropy energy ( per two fe sites ) : @xmath300 thus , @xmath301 depends only on the orientation @xmath232 of the spin spiral relative to the anisotropy axis .",

    "@xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath301 can reveal a different @xmath304-dependence , because all these quantities will depend on the additional phases of magnetic moments , which are acquired due to the bunching .",

    "<S> in many cases , the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction can be regarded as a small perturbation to the electronic structure of solids and treated using regular perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the major obstacle on this route comes from the fact that the so interaction can also polarize the electron system and produce some additional contributions to the perturbation theory expansion , which arise from the electron - electron interactions in the same order of the so coupling . in electronic structure calculations </S>",
    "<S> , it may even lead to necessity to abandon the perturbation theory and return to the original self - consistently solution of kohn - sham - like equations with the effective potential @xmath0 , incorporating simultaneously the effects of the electron - electron interactions and the so coupling , even though the latter is small . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present the theory of self - consistent linear response ( sclr ) , which allows us to get rid of numerical self - consistency and formulate the last step fully analytically in the first order of the so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy is applied to the solution of effective hubbard - type model in unrestricted hartree - fock approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the model itself is derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations in the basis of wannier states close to the fermi level and is considered to be a good starting point for the analysis of magnetic properties of realistic transition - metal oxides . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , by using @xmath0 , obtained in the sclr theory , one can successfully reproduce results of ordinary self - consistent calculations for the orbital magnetization and other properties , which emerge in the first order of the so coupling . particularly , sclr appears to be extremely useful approach for calculations of antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions based on the magnetic force theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that only by using _ </S>",
    "<S> total _ </S>",
    "<S> perturbation , one can make a reliable estimate for the dm parameters . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , due to the powerful @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 theorem , the sclr theory allows us to obtain the total energy change up to the third order of the so coupling , which can be used in calculations of magnetic anisotropy of compounds with low crystal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the fruitfulness of this approach for the analysis of complex magnetic structure is illustrated on a number of example , including the quantitative description of the spin canting in ytio@xmath4 and lamno@xmath4 , formation of the spin - spiral order in bifeo@xmath4 , and the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking in bimno@xmath4 , which gives rise to both ferroelectric activity and dm interactions , responsible for the ferromagnetism . </S>"
