    "one pioneer work of this subject was presented by jacobson in ref.@xcite , in which the einstein field equation was obtained by using the clausius relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy flux , @xmath3 is unruh temperature and @xmath4 is the entropy of thermodynamic system .",
    "then , brustein and hadad proved that the motion equation of generalized gravity theory is equivalent to thermodynamic clausius relation through a more general definition of the noether charge entropy @xcite . soon after that",
    ", this method is generalized to diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity by padmanabhan in ref.@xcite , and parikh and sarkar in ref.@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse view was put forward to build the connection in which the einstein equation could be treated as a thermodynamic identity .",
    "padmanabhan first noticed that the gravitational field equation of the spherically symmetric spacetime can be rewritten in a form of the ordinary first law of thermodynamics at the black hole horizon @xcite .",

    "then , steinhardt and turok presented a cyclic model where universe is dynamical from the big bang to the big crunch in every cycle @xcite .",
    "most cosmological problems such as the horizon problem and flatness problem could be solved well without inflation in the above various cosmological models @xcite .",
    "based on the consideration about the problems of the cosmological constant and the singular big bang , liu and wesson proposed a big bounce cosmological model with a variable cosmological  constant \" , in which there is only one transition from contraction to expansion @xcite . before the bounce , it contracts from an empty de sitter vacuum .",

    "this type of big bounce universe satisfies the 5d field equations @xmath7 .",
    "the content of this theory is mathematically rich because two extra functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are included .",
    "the most interesting is that the big bang appeared in the standard 4d cosmological model is replaced by a big bounce in this model where at the bouncing point the universe arrives at a finite minimum scale . after the contraction of the bounce , our universe starts expanding immediately . in usual 4d bounce universe under the context of standard general relativity",
    ", there exists the so - called inhomogeneity problem that the enormous inhomogeneities are unavoidable in the collapsing phase @xcite .",
    "however , in this 5d bounce universe the spacetime is not symmetric either before or after the bounce point .",
    "the contraction is dominated by the new matter created because the universe could be empty at the beginning of contraction .",

    "it should be noticed that the function adopted as @xmath10 is based on the fact that in the spatially flat frw universe the time evolution of the scale factor has the form of power law .",
    "considering two different phases in early and late universe , the radiation dominated and matter dominated standard frw universes are obtained respectively . by employing the first law of thermodynamics and the fluid s continuity equation to the apparent horizon , we could derive the friedmann equations in the 5d big bounce universe .",
    "motivated by the recent astronomical observations which favor a flat universe , we also study its universal spatially flat model and its two extreme cases : the cold 3d flat case and the hot 3d flat case .",

    "based on the above explicit spherical symmetry metric ( [ 14dremetr ] ) , the dynamical apparent horizon is determined by the relation @xmath52 which implies that the vector @xmath53 is null on the surface of apparent horizon .",
    "the radius of apparent horizon @xmath54 could be given below by the explicit evaluation of the condition , @xmath55 where the apparent horizon is established on the trapped region @xcite .",
    "once the geometry of spacetime @xmath56 is determined by the einstein equation , the horizon area and surface gravity are purely geometric quantities determined by the spacetime geometry and the formulae of black hole entropy and temperature have a certain universality with horizon . like in black hole physics , the associated temperature with the apparent horizon is assumed to be proportional to their surface gravity at the apparent horizon , i.e. @xmath57 , where the surface gravity @xmath58 is defined by @xcite @xmath59 because the structure of spacetime @xmath56 is spherically symmetric it is reasonable to assume that the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is one quarter of the area of the apparent horizon , i.e. @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the area of apparent horizon .",
    "when adopting the perfect fluid s energy - momentum tensor @xmath62 , the energy - supply vector is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the work density defined by @xmath65 . by using above energy - supply vector ,",
    "the amount of energy crossing the apparent horizon is given by @xmath66 based on the apparent horizon s temperature @xmath3 , the entropy @xmath4 and the crossing amount energy @xmath67 , the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath68 , can give the spatial - spatial component of the friedmann equations shown by @xmath69 which describes the 4d frw universe with spatial curvature @xmath21 in this big bounce universe .",
    "then based on the above friedmann equation ( [ freq1 ] ) , the perfect fluid s continuity equation is shown by @xmath70 which can help us get another temporal - temporal component of friedmann equations as @xmath71 hence , the friedmann equations ( [ freq1 ] ) and ( [ anotherfrea ] ) for the 4d frw universe in this 5d big bounce universe are obtained by the first law of thermodynamics and the perfect fluid s continuity equation near the apparent horizon @xmath72 . the connections between the gravity of 5d big bounce universe and the thermodynamics of its apparent horizon are obtained . on each hypersurface",

    "the detail expressions of @xmath73 are already given in original ref.@xcite .",
    "then , in order to check the influence of vacuum on the energy flow across horizon , let us look at the total matter ( or liquid ) components containing both vacuum contribution and the normal matter .",
    "we set the total density @xmath76 and the total pressure @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 belong to vacuum , @xmath38 and @xmath39 belong to the normal liquid or matter .",

    "the flow of energy across the horizon depends only on the non - vacuum part .",
    "in fact , according to the energy - momentum tensor in eq.([1energymomentum ] ) , the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath38 can belong to any perfect liquids including the vacuum provided the equation of state @xmath84 is satisfied . for different liquids ,",
    "the values of @xmath85 are different .",
    "for the cosmological constant case ( or vacuum case ) , the state parameter @xmath85 equals @xmath86 . because there is a relationship for vacuum @xmath87",
    ", it is also easy to see the vacuum contributes nothing to the flow of energy across the cosmological apparent horizon .",
    "it is generally known that the results of recent cmb s astronomical observations incline our universe towards a spatially flat case .",
    "in fact if the universe is not flat the geodesics of massless particles such as photons starting out parallel to each other will slowly diverge later @xcite .",
    "meanwhile many other evidences also support the flatness fact , such as the researching of anisotropy spectrum based on three small scale experiments : dasi @xcite , maxima @xcite , boomerang @xcite . in the anisotropy spectrum ,",
    "the pattern of peaks and troughs is shifted to scales smaller than that predicted by open cosmology , clearly favoring the flat case .",
    "moreover the early astrophysical data such as the age of the universe @xcite also indicates that the spatial sections of frw universe probably is flat .",
    "just as what is said in ref.@xcite , this 5d big bounce scenario can describe many cosmological models by choosing different proper scalar factor functions , especially in the universal spatially flat case .",
    "under the situation we consider , the scale factors of this big bounce are given by @xcite @xmath88 where the equation of state is taken to be the isothermal one i.e. @xmath84 . the ordinary matter",
    "is represented by the state with @xmath85 in the range @xmath89 .",
    "two extreme cases which are the dust and radiation and ultrarelativistic particles are represented by the sates of @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath19 in the above formula depends on the state parameter @xmath85 , @xmath92 the density of matter and the cosmological term are listed by @xmath93 .",

    "thus , the derivative relationship between the hubble constant and apparent horizon is given by @xmath95 .",
    "then just as what has been done in the former section we assume that the entropy of the apparent horizon takes the normal form @xmath96 and the temperature as @xmath97 .",
    "hence , according to the amount of energy crossing the apparent horizon , i.e. eq.([amountenergy ] ) and the first law of thermodynamics , the friedmann equation is also given by @xmath98 substituting the continuity equation ( [ perconeq ] ) into eq.([2feauqtion1 ] ) and integrating the equation , we can obtain another component of friedmann equations in this spatially flat model , @xmath99 according to the hubble constant @xmath100 in eq.([2apphori ] ) and the spatial friedmann equation ( [ 2feauqtion2 ] ) , the density of big bounce universe with general 3d flat is given by @xmath101}.\\ ] ] in order to relate the foregoing properties to the subject of apparent horizons , in the following discussion we will consider the original models discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , relevant to the cold and hot phases of the universe .      in this subsection",
    ", we will discuss the cold 3d flat case .",
    "the contribution of the energy component comes chiefly from its rest part rather than its thermodynamic kinetic part .",
    "the work of pressure changes only the trivial thermodynamic kinetic energy , and hence the modification of the total mass of @xmath102 could be ignored safely . in the natural unit ,",
    "the pressure of dust is equal to its density of thermal kinetic energy which satisfies @xmath103 , thus without loss of correctness we can set @xmath90 and @xmath104 to represent the matter content of the late universe .",
    "hence , in this 5d big bounce universe , the cold 3d flat case is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 and the parameters are listed as @xmath107 . about the detailed discussion of this case , one can refer to ref .",
    "it s interesting that there is a finite minimum of scalar factor @xmath8 at @xmath108 , before which our universe contracts and after which it expands . in the usual frw model , when the time approaches zero the scalar factor vanishes",
    "this situation leads directly to a singularity geometry and the divergent matter , which is called the big bang .",
    "however , in this big bounce universe , the 5d curvature invariant in eq.([1kretschmann ] ) is finite on the hypersurface of @xmath109 . furthermore , besides the 5d curvature invariant because @xmath110 and @xmath111 are satisfied at the point of @xmath112 , all dynamical quantities in this big bounce universe do not diverge such as @xmath38 , @xmath73 , @xmath113 and so on .",

    "the apparent horizons coincide with each other at the time @xmath132 where intersection point has nothing to do with the extra dimension which could be seen easily by the definition of the apparent horzion in eq.([4coldhubble++ ] ) . before the time of intersection",

    "similar with the scalar factor s bounce point @xmath112 , there is also a finite minimum of @xmath54 at @xmath133 , before @xmath134 the apparent horizon contracts and after @xmath134 it expands .",
    "in order to compare with universe s big bounce , it is necessary to have a look at the difference between @xmath112 and @xmath134 under the late time condition . after differentiating eq.([1hubble ] ) with respect to time in the cold case",
    ", we can get a formulas @xmath135 where the last term is negligible for late universe .",
    "hence , one can find that with a given extra dimension the bounce time of apparent horizon @xmath134 has the same magnitude with universe s big bounce time @xmath112 in late universe algebraically .",
    "the result indicates that in the late stage of cold 3d flat universe the apparent horizon contracts before bounce time and expands after it , in agreement with the evolution of the big bounce s scale factor @xmath8 exactly .      in this part we will discuss the late universe dominated by the radiation or ultrarelativistic particles , such as the photon radiation . because the rest mass of photon is null and",
    "the thermal kinematic velocity is the speed of light , the whole density of photon comes from its kinematic mass completely .",
    "based on the planck statistical distribution of photon , the equation of state is @xmath136 .",

    "the behavior of this hot universe is similar with the cold case , which contracts before the time of big bounce @xmath112 and expands after @xmath112 .",
    "for further discussions , one can refer to ref.@xcite .",

    "when @xmath119 the first term of @xmath144 in eq.([5hota ] ) is dominant , we can have the following approximate expressions @xmath145    the 5d radiation metric is obtained as @xmath146 dt^2 - 4 t \\left[1 - \\frac{cy}{2 t } + \\mathcal{o}(t^{-2})\\right]\\left(d r^2 + r^2 d \\omega^2\\right ) - d y^2,\\ ] ] which is analogous to the 4d radiation metric . unlike the cold case , when @xmath123 approaches proper time , the scale factor varies as @xmath147 .",

    "the hubble parameter is @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the integral constant .",
    "the energy density of this case is shown by @xmath166 it looks a little surprising that both in the cold case ( [ 4coldaa ] ) and in the hot case ( [ 5hot2eta1 ] ) , the geometries have the same form exactly . in order to see why it is this , we need to start from the very beginning , i.e. the universal formulas eqs.([addeta3dflat ] ) , ( [ addzeta3dflat ] ) and ( [ addmuandn3dflat ] ) describing the 3d flat model no matter in cold case or in hot case .",
    "then considering the situation of the early universe stage @xmath167 , the scalar factor is rewritten approximately as @xmath168 calculating the partial derivative of @xmath169 with respect to @xmath123 directly , one can get the expression of @xmath170 @xmath171 which gives us @xmath172 appeared in the metric , @xmath173    then in this big bounce universe , the parameter @xmath174 in eq.([addmuandn3dflat ] ) is negative if the state parameter @xmath85 is positive .",

    "( [ 2rho ] ) and the cosmological term in eq.([2lambda ] ) , with general state parameter @xmath85 we can get @xmath181 and @xmath183 which is justified as the limit of @xmath184 in the early stage of cold and hot 3d flat universe shown by ref.@xcite . moreover , according to eq.([66eta ] )",
    "the apparent horizon satisfies @xmath185 which shows again that the extra dimension affects the early universe more deeply .",
    "then according to the coordinate transformation @xmath178 , one can see that @xmath186 corresponds to @xmath187 , in which @xmath188 is the proper time of 4d .",
    "so the universe exists forever before the big bounce in @xmath188 time .",
    "so in the early stage of the 3d flat universe , the geometries of spacetime , which contain the 4d de sitter metric , have the same forms exactly no matter for the cold case or the hot case .",
    "this result does not depend on the equation of state and has nothing to do with the specific form of matter .",
    "it should be noted that the same line elements containing a 4d de sitter metric at the early stage for both cold and hot models mean that they are equivalent to the vacuum metric in the early stages their evolution .",
    "however , this interesting result can not be applied to late stages .",
    "it is because the proper time @xmath188 of the two cases are different in that the coordinate transformation @xmath178 depends on the choice of parameter @xmath174 shown in eq.([addmuandn3dflat ] ) . for the cold model with @xmath90",

    "the friedmann equations of universe can be obtained by using the first law of thermodynamics , and the perfect fluid s continuity equation ( [ perconeq ] ) to the apparent horizon with general spatial curvature .",
    "meanwhile , we also check the result in two extreme cases under the spatially flat universe , one is the dust case described by the matter content of the late universe with @xmath90 and @xmath193 , another is the case of radiation or ultrarelativistic particles described the early universe with @xmath91 and @xmath194 .",
    "the continuity equation used here is different from that of the normal 4d case , i.e. @xmath195 .",
    "the reason is that hubble parameters eq.([1hubble ] ) of big bounce universe are determined both by the scale factor of 3d space @xmath8 ( [ addeta ] ) and the scale factor of the time @xmath9 ( [ addzeta ] ) .",
    "this situation is unlike the hubble parameter of the normal 4d universe which is determined only by the scale factor of 3d space .",
    "secondly , the bounce points illustrated in figs.[fig11 ] and [ fig33 ] also exist in the apparent horizon for the late cold and hot universes .",
    "in these two cases , the apparent horizons decrease monotonously before bounce points and increase monotonously after them which is in agreement with universe s scalar factor @xmath196 .",
    "it is also found that in these late cases the apparent horizons cross at the point of @xmath132 which are unaffected by the extra dimension . with larger extra dimension , the apparent horizon decreases before @xmath132 and increases after this point . in the early stage of universe",
    ", it is interesting that based on a general state parameter @xmath85 the original big bounce metric ( [ 15dmetric ] ) reduces to a canonical form metric ( [ 66dmetric ] ) which contains a 4d de sitter metric .",
    "this result is independent on the equation of state .",
    "the apparent horizon of the early universe , i.e. @xmath185 , is dependent on the extra dimension which indicates the extra dimension affects the early universe strongly .",
    "thirdly , the surface gravity @xmath58 is a classical quantity which plays an important role in black hole s thermodynamics .",
    "however , the generally accepted definition of @xmath58 only exists near killing horizons in stationary space - times @xcite , which is based on the existence of a global time translational killing vector field that becomes null on the event horizon . in a dynamical setting the killing vector does nt exist so the killing definition of surface gravity is no longer valid .",
    "various dynamical definitions are proposed to address this problem @xcite . in this paper , we adopt bak and rey s method to define the surface gravity @xmath58 associated with the dynamical apparent horizon , i.e. eq.([addsurface ] ) , which could be treated as a generalization of kodama vector definition proposed by hayward et al .",
    "@xcite . according to this kind definition of surface gravity in eq.([addsurface ] ) , we can get a direct calculation given by @xmath197 then based on the first law of thermodynamics @xmath198 which is assumed to hold for the dynamical apparent horizon , the apparent horizon radius @xmath54 should be regarded to have a fixed magnitude after considering an infinitesimal amount of energy crossing the apparent horizon .",
    "so in this way , we have a approximate relationship @xmath199 which correctly recover @xmath200 at the apparent horizon .",
    "all in all the horizon area and surface gravity are purely geometric quantities given by the spacetime geometry , and the entropy and temperature have a certain universality with the horizon .",
    "fourthly , we also would like give some words about the relationship between the hubble constant and the entropy associated with the apparent horizon . according to the expression of apparent",
    "horizon in eq.([1apphor1 ] ) derived from the vector @xmath53 in eq.([addapparenthorizon ] ) , one can see that if the spatial curvature vanishes , the apparent horizon is equal to the reciprocal of the hubble constant , which is already justified by many literatures @xcite . then the thermodynamics is applied to the apparent horizon . in this way , we can construct the relationship between the hubble constant and the entropy of the apparent horizon .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that this cosmological model is compatible with the observational consequences under the appropriate choice of parameters . about this aspect",
    "there are many literatures @xcite .",
    "three components contained in the matter , which are cdm+baryons @xmath201 , radiation @xmath202 and dark energy @xmath203 , are first studied in @xcite .",
    "these three components are assumed to be minimally coupled with each others and the corresponding pressures are given by @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "the dimensionless density parameters for cdm+baryons , radiation and dark energy are given by @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "for the simplest case , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are assumed . in order to match the observational data , the parameters are chosen as followings : @xmath212 .",
    "one of results shows that the proportion of cdm+baryons and dark energy are @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the results give the redshift @xmath215 for the transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion which agrees with @xmath216 obtained from the observations through sn ia luminosity distance .",
    "the equation of state of dark energy @xmath217 is obtained as well .",
    "later , the metric functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are converted into a new function @xmath218 with the cosmological red shifts as the only variable @xcite .",
    "function @xmath218 could be determined according to the universe s parameterization . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "two components of cdm+baryons and dark energy are considered in which the function @xmath218 takes on an equivalent function as the potential @xmath219 in quintessence or phantom models .",
    "their results show that a scaling stage exists before @xmath220 where the ratio of dark energy to cdm+baryons could be constant and the coincidence problem could be avoided . at @xmath221",
    "there is a transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion .",
    "other predictions including densities @xmath222 and @xmath223 , the deceleration parameters @xmath224 and so on in this big bounce universe are consistent with the current observations . until now , we still do not know too much about the detail of the universe including the dark energy , dark matter and so on .",
    "the complete parameterization beyond the models are not finished .",
    "however , many results obtained in this model are compatible with the observations . about the detailed content about the parameter chosen to fit the observational data on the real universe",
    ", one can refer to the literatures @xcite .",
