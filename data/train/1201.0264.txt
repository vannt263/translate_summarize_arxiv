    "the basic idea is to define the gravitational path integral as a sum over triangulated surfaces .",
    "any physical observable is then defined on the ensemble of all such triangulations . at the end , continuum physics is obtained by performing a scaling limit in which one takes the size of the triangulations to infinity keeping the physical area constant .    on the probabilistic side angel and",
    "schramm @xcite first introduced the uniform measure on infinite planar triangulations proving the existence of the above scaling limit as a weak limit .",
    "this construction was essential to prove several properties of such uniform infinite triangulations .",
    "in particular angel @xcite proved that the volume of a ball @xmath0 of radius @xmath1 is of order @xmath2 and that the length of the boundary is of order @xmath3 .",
    "this proved rigorously that the fractal dimension of such triangulations is @xmath4 , a result long known to physicists ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "later krikun @xcite obtained the exact limit theorem for the scaled boundary length of @xmath5    while two - dimensional euclidean quantum gravity defined through dt definitely has a rich mathematical structure as pointed out above , as a model of quantum gravity it failed to be numerically extended to higher dimensions .",
    "this lead to the development of a different approach of so - called causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) by ambjrn and loll @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the _ euclidean _ model , cdt provides a nonperturbative definition of the _ lorentzian _ gravitational path integral .",
    "these causal triangulations differ from their euclidean analogs in the fact that they have a time - sliced structure of fixed spatial topology .",
    "consider for example triangulations of an overall topology of a cylinder .",
    "then the triangulation consists of slices @xmath6 $ ] from time @xmath7 to time @xmath8 as illustrated in figure  [ f0 ] . here , edges connecting vertices in slices of equal time are called space - like edges , while edges connecting subsequent slices are called time - like edges .",
    "note that this class of triangulations forms a causal structure needed to model lorentzian geometries .",
    "in particular , we can think that a vertex @xmath9 lies in the future of a vertex @xmath10 iff there is a path of time - like edges leading from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the vertices @xmath10 and @xmath9 as illustrated in figure  [ f0 ] are not causally related .     to time @xmath8 .",

    "the physical properties of the ensemble of causal triangulations behaves much more regular than its euclidean counterpart .",
    "for example , it has a fractal dimension of @xmath11 instead of @xmath4 for dt",
    ". also when coupled to simple matter models , such as the ising model , it behaves much more like a regular lattice such as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "while the approach of cdt has recently lead to a number of interesting physical results , especially with respect to higher - dimensional numerical implementations ( see @xcite for a review ) , the probabilistic aspects of this model have hardly been studied .",

    ".  bounded from above by @xmath13 .",
    "a similar definition of the uniform measure has previously also been used by one of the authors of this article and m. krikun to prove the existence of a phase transition for the ising model coupled to cdt @xcite .    in this article",
    "we discuss the existence of the uniform measure on infinite causal triangulations in an alternative presentation to @xcite . in the line of @xcite and",
    "@xcite we give weak convergence limits for the distribution of the area and length of the boundary of a ball of radius @xmath7 , confirming that they scale as @xmath14 and @xmath7 .",
    "these results follow from a bijection between causal triangulations and certain galton - watson branching processes through the size biased branching process measure @xcite - the critical branching process distribution conditioned on survival at infinity . exploiting the relation to conditioned critical galton - watson processes , one can go further and obtain weak convergence of the joint length and area process .",
    "the process is diffusive and the corresponding kolmogorov equation enables us to derive the physical hamiltonian , providing us with a mathematical rigorous formulation of scaling limits of cdt .",

    "the distribution of @xmath277 appears at several places related to the study of brownian motion as has been exposed for example in @xcite .",
    "based on the discussion in @xcite we can make two remarks :    [ seriesrep ] the random variable @xmath277 , as introduced in remark [ remarkarea ] , can be written in the following series representation @xmath279 where the @xmath280 , @xmath281 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with gamma distribution with parameter two , i.e.  @xmath244 , @xmath245 . the relation can easily be seen by noting that @xmath282    [ levy ] in the framework of lvy - khintchine representations a distribution is called infinitely divisible iff its laplace transform @xmath283 admits the following representation @xmath284 for some @xmath285 . here @xmath286 is the so - called lvy measure and for the present application it is sufficient to consider the form of a simple density @xmath287 . by a straightforward and explicit computation using and",
    "one sees that the distribution of @xmath277 is infinitely divisible and has a lvy - khintchine representations with @xmath288 and lvy density @xmath289",
    "we discussed infinite causal triangulations and the existence of the uniform measure on those , so - called uict , in an alternative presentation to @xcite .",
    "one observes that under this measure the probability of a causal triangulation of a cylinder is related to a critical galton - watson process conditioned to never die out .",
    "we used this relation to prove weak convergence of the joint rescaled length - area process @xmath290 of an infinite ct constructed from an arbitrary critical galton - watson process to a limiting diffusion process @xmath291 , with @xmath292 , where the it s equation for @xmath237 is given by ( e.g.  theorem [ thmlength ] and [ thmarea ] ) @xmath293 in particular , we show that the feynman - kac formula for @xmath294 $ ] corresponds to a imaginary time schrdinger equation with the following hamiltonian @xmath295 this is the well - known hamiltonian for two - dimensional cdt with cosmological constant @xmath268 ( see @xcite ) .    by calculating the inverse laplace transform of one",

    "this expression is also known in physics as the cdt propagator . in particular , setting @xmath272 one obtains the transition amplitude for the length process @xmath299    in conclusion , theorem [ thmlength ] and [ thmarea ] provide us with a mathematical rigorous proof of certain scaling limits of two - dimensional causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) . in ongoing work",
    ", we further show how to obtain these results in a slightly different manner from a certain growth process of uict .",
    "while in this article we given a mathematical rigorous derivation for several correlations functions of cdt from the uict it would be interesting to obtain the full scaling limit using a framework like in le gall s and mierment s work on the brownian map in the context of dt @xcite .",
