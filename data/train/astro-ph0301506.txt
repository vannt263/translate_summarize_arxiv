    "( _ cxo _  ) imaging have discovered toroidal structure in the synchrotron pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) of relativistic particles and magnetic fields around young neutron stars ( e.g. weisskopf _ et  al .",
    "_ 2000 , pavlov _",
    "_ 2001 , gotthelf 2001 ) . of these , the crab and vela pulsar tori are the most striking , with clear symmetry ( pulsar spin ) axes .",
    "moreover , for these two objects _ hst _  proper motion studies show alignment between the position angles of the projected @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the chance probability of two such alignments is modest , but if taken as causal this gives strong constraints on nature of the ` kick ' at pulsar birth which typically produces a large space velocity ( spruit & phinney 1998 , lai _",
    "et  al . _",
    "even a few further examples could improve the statistical significance of the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation and further constrain the kick physics (  4 ) .",
    "the challenge is to identify sources for which both pwn tori and 2-d proper motions are measurable ; after the crab and vela , many bright young psr / pwn sources are quite distant and direct proper motion measurement is challenging .",
    "we report here on _ cxo _  imaging of one particularly interesting example .",
    "@xmath0  , discovered by @xcite is a 143ms pulsar with characteristic age @xmath4y .",
    "located within the old @xmath5y snr s147 ( g180.0@xmath61.7 ) with a dm - estimated distance of 1.2kpc @xcite comparable to that of the snr , it is believed to be a likely association despite the age discrepancy .",
    "previously reported x - ray observations are limited to _",
    "rosat _  all sky survey ( sun et al 1996 ) and _ hri _   imaging",
    ". inspection of the archival _ hri _ data showed a source slightly extended beyond the nominal psf , although aspect errors may have contributed .",
    "we have obtained _ acis _  -s imaging to resolve this possible pwn .",
    "we observed @xmath0  with the _ cxo _  _ acis _ on february 7 - 8 , 2002 , with the pulsar near the s3 chip aim - point , obtaining 19.5ks of te exposure .",
    "all 6 _ acis _  chips were active and several field sources were detected off axis .",
    "none showed markedly unusual behavior ; we therefore concentrate on the s3 pulsar data .",
    "calibration , processing and spectral fitting were performed with ciao 2.3 , including the latest calibrations and cte corrections .",
    "the pulsar core produces 0.13 cnts / s and , with the standard 3.2s acis frame , suffers 20% pileup . in figure 1 we compare the 0.5 - 5kev source radial profile with that of the hrma+acis model psf ( generated for the observed source count spectrum and corrected for pileup ) .",
    "the point source normalization has been obtained from a psf fit to the central 3@xmath7 .",
    "the core is resolved , with @xmath8% of the counts in extended emission .",
    "if the psf is convolved with a @xmath9 gaussian , the counts are well matched out to 5@xmath7 , but a @xmath10 excess remains above background from @xmath11 .",
    "we thus believe that the extended emission can not be attributed to aspect errors or poor psf modeling .",
    "this emission does not follow the symmetric psf wings ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we start by fitting elliptical isophotes , with semi - major axes from 1 - 10@xmath7 , using the stsdas routine _",
    "ellipse_. for small @xmath12 semi - major axes , we find an ellipticity of @xmath13 at position angle @xmath14 ( measured n - e ) . from @xmath15",
    "the pa changes to a weighted average value of 61.0@xmath16 with an ellipticity of 0.25 - 0.35 . in figure 2 ,",
    "the core has a tail to the se defining the inner ellipse , while the scattered photons along the ne - sw axis represent the larger ellipse .",
    "some trailing along the read - out direction is visible in the detector coordinate image ( at pa= 91@xmath17 ) , but can not be seen in figure 2 .",
    "the measured trail flux contributes less than 1 count in the @xmath18 region of our extended emission , and does not lie along the axis of extension .    in analogy to other pulsar / pwn systems we can expect a toroidal wind shock surrounding the pulsar , possibly with a polar jet .",
    "the @xmath15 ellipse has a scale comparable to the expected wind shock radius for a confinement pressure appropriate to the interior of s147 ( see  3 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt this physical model , computing the expected photons from the point source psf wings and fitting the excess photons outside of @xmath19 to an inclined torus .",
    "a uniform background for the residual counts is also allowed .",
    "the torus model is characterized by a radius @xmath20 , a gaussian blur torus thickness @xmath21 , the position angle @xmath22 of the torus axis and its inclination @xmath23 from the observer line of sight .",
    "we assume that the post - shock flow remains relativistic , so that the emission is doppler boosted in the forward direction . for a rest power law emission spectrum @xmath24 , we expect an observed emissivity @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the photon spectral index , @xmath27 is the bulk velocity of the post shock flow and @xmath28 is the unit normal toward the observer ( e.g. pelling _ et  al . _   1987 ) . for typical pwne ,",
    "@xmath29 and the emission brightens on the side facing the observer .    of the 2875 counts in the central 32@xmath30 region , the best - fit point source provides 2430 , the uniform background contributes 80 counts and the ` torus ' provides 50 counts .",
    "the remaining counts represent unresolved fine structure in the nebula core .",
    "the best - fit torus radius is @xmath31 , the ` blur ' scale is @xmath32 .",
    "the torus @xmath33 is @xmath34 , similar to values fit for other pwn .",
    "the torus symmetry axis is located at position angle @xmath35 ( measured n through e ) and @xmath36 ( into the plane of the sky ) , where the confidence regions have been scaled to that of @xmath22 .    in figure 2",
    "we show the photon data and the predicted image for the best - fit point source + torus model .",
    "the position angle @xmath22 is robust to cuts in the fit data set and forced variations in @xmath20 and @xmath21 and agrees well with the value determined from ellipse isophote fits ; we adopt this value as determining the symmetry axis .",
    "@xmath23 , primarily set by the ellipse axis ratio , is also surprisingly well determined .",
    "the brightening of the diffuse emission se of the core indicates the near side of the torus , enhanced by doppler beaming ( inset ) .",
    "however , the core asymmetry also suggests a ` polar jet ' .",
    "certainly deeper exposures would be quite valuable in confirming the reality of these faint structures and measuring their precise parameters .",
    "we extract the point source from a @xmath37 aperture , correcting for pileup and measuring a nearby background from the s3 chip . for the torus",
    "we take a @xmath38 ellipse with a @xmath39 radius exclusion core .",
    "the psf wings of the central source contribute significant counts in this aperture , so we include a scaled version of the best - fit point source spectrum as a fixed background and fit the excess to characterize the torus emission .",
    "the point source spectrum is adequately modeled by an absorbed blackbody , although systematic residuals persist at low energies .",
    "table 1 gives the fit parameters with 95% errors , the unabsorbed bolometric flux and the effective radius of a spherical emittor at @xmath40kpc .",
    "the second fit is from the magnetic h atmosphere models of @xcite , which produce slightly better @xmath41 and a larger effective radius .",
    "we note that all of these fits are somewhat suspect , since the spatial decomposition suggests @xmath8% diffuse emission even for the core .",
    "composite ( bb+bb or bb+pl ) models of course improve the fit statistics , but are not demanded by the present data .",
    "these fits give @xmath42 somewhat larger than the @xmath43 inferred from the pulsar dm with a canonical @xmath44 .",
    "a comparison of the energies of the 51 torus photons outside of @xmath39 with the 240 photons from @xmath45 ( which avoid pile - up in the point source core ) gives a ks statistic probability of 0.06 that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the torus region photons are thus significantly harder than the point source ( despite the 30% contamination by the psf wings ) ; this further supports the independant nature of this component .",
    "we assume a pl model for this torus emission .",
    "fixing @xmath42 as above and assuming a typical pwn @xmath46 , we find an unabsorbed flux @xmath47 for the full torus .",
    "this spindown efficiency @xmath48 is about @xmath49 lower than that of most @xmath50y pulsars .",
    "s147 is a late blast wave phase snr , quite circular in both radio @xcite and h@xmath26 @xcite images , with a @xmath51 diameter .",
    "the estimated 0.8 - 1.6  kpc distance agrees very well with the pulsar s 1.2  kpc dm - derived distance .",
    "@xcite find the geometrical center at 05:40 , + 27:44 @xmath52 ( j2000 ) . at the nominal distance",
    "the @xmath53 sedov solution gives a blast wave age of @xmath54y and an expansion velocity @xmath55km / s for a local ism density @xmath56 @xmath57 and an explosion energy @xmath58erg .",
    "the optical expansion velocity @xmath59km / s @xcite agrees well , supporting the distance estimate .",
    "if we assume magnetic dipole spindown ( @xmath60 ) with a constant field @xmath61 g , the spindown luminosity at characteristic age @xmath62y is @xmath63 leading to a scale for the wind termination @xmath64 this termination will be azimuthally symmetric ( e.g. toroidal ) whenever the external static pressure @xmath65 , i.e. subsonic pulsar motion at a speed @xmath66km / s . in the general ism , @xmath67 is typically a few@xmath68 ; all but the slowest young pulsars should display non - toroidal bow shocks .",
    "however , in the interior of a sedov - phase snr we have @xmath69 where the ambient ism density is @xmath70 and we have distinguished between the true ( = snr ) pulsar age @xmath71 and the characteristic age @xmath72 . since the density in the hot interior is quite low , eg . @xmath73 $ ] @xcite , we expect pulsars in the interior of snr to be in the toroidal shock phase for @xmath74 .",
    "the difficulty is that at typical speeds of @xmath75 , a pulsar outruns the blast wave by @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , as soon as it passes the contact discontinuity , the large density and ram pressure jump ensure a bow shock morphology .",
    "psr 1951 + 32 in ctb 80 is likely in this phase ( shull _ et  al .",
    "_ 1988 ) .    according to these estimates , a torus for @xmath0  is not unexpected . at @xmath77",
    "we would normally find it in the ambient ism , but its low @xmath78 keeps it in its host snr . with a low @xmath79 ,",
    "the pulsar husbands its spin - down luminosity giving a torus of angular size @xmath80 or about @xmath81 for @xmath0  , among the largest angular sizes expected for known pulsars ( after crab and vela ) .",
    "since the observed inner edge of the torus is at @xmath82 , these estimates agree if @xmath83 or @xmath84 .    given the large offset of @xmath0  from the remnant center , a good test of the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation can be made .",
    "the offset vector implies a proper motion @xmath85 mas / y at position angle @xmath86 .",
    "the pulsar transverse velocity is 134@xmath87km / s .",
    "together with the torus geometry estimates of  2.2 , this offset gives a kick - spin position angle difference of @xmath88 . if @xmath3 is along the torus axis , the 3d velocity is @xmath89km / s , rather low for an isolated pulsar .",
    "the crab pulsar optical proper motion @xcite and inner nebula axis vectors give @xmath90 .",
    "for vela , the symmetry axis of the x - ray torus in @xcite is aligned within @xmath91 @xcite or @xmath92 @xcite using the radio or optical @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the joint probability of obtaining these ( 2-d ) projections by chance is @xmath93% , making the association intriguing , but not definitive .",
    "if one adopt @xmath0  as a third alignment , the chance probability drops to @xmath94 .",
    "one of the key discriminants of the origin of this correlation is the initial pulsar spin period @xmath95 @xcite . for a constant braking index @xmath56",
    "one finds @xmath96/(n-1).\\ ] ] since our pwn position angle supports the connection with s147 , we must reconcile the @xmath97y ( @xmath60 ) characteristic age with the maximum plausible age @xmath98y of the snr .",
    "one possibility is very rapid @xmath99 decay , giving an effective @xmath100 .",
    "more likely , as for several other psr - snr associations there is a large initial spin period .",
    "the observed thermal luminosity supports the young age and large @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath101 , interpreted as full surface cooling agrees well with the flux in standard cooling scenarios near @xmath102y . at @xmath103ms ( @xmath104 )",
    "@xmath0  has one of the slowest initial spins known .",
    "physical kick - spin connections generally rely on rotational averaging @xcite , so this large @xmath95 is problematic for many proposed mechanisms .",
    "if the kicks are isotropically distributed , the net moment at @xmath105 must be averaged for @xmath106 to achieve a final spin - kick angle @xmath107 .",
    "indeed , since ` natal ' kicks may be applied before the neutron star has reached its final @xmath108 cm radius , conservation of angular momentum for kicks at @xmath109 increases the effective initial period by @xmath110 .",
    "thus for @xmath0  , we require @xmath111 for the observed @xmath107 .    certainly the e - m rocket ( harrison - tademaru ) effect is hopeless , as it requires @xmath112ms for 100km / s velocities .",
    "also hydromagnetic models imparting momentum over @xmath113s are inadequate , especially as the momentum deposition is at the @xmath114 shock break - out .",
    "even mechanisms invoking asymmetric @xmath115 emission are severely constrained , but appear just feasible considering the @xmath116s @xmath115 diffusion timescale at @xmath117 . however inducing the large required @xmath115 asymmetry is challenging",
    ". for magnetic - field induced asymmetry , even @xmath0  s modest velocity requires an ordered neutrinosphere field of @xmath118 g @xcite , otherwise unmotivated for this low @xmath99 pulsar .    as an alternative one",
    "may imagine schemes where the spin is driven to the kick axis .",
    "one possibility is post - collapse accretion of a remnant disk ( blandford , private comm . ) .",
    "imagine a disk of @xmath119 accreting at a super - eddington rate onto a @xmath120 neutron star with moment of inertia @xmath121 .",
    "the disk is approximately keplerian down to some inner radius @xmath122 , at which point we assume roughly half of the mass accretes while the remainder is ejected in polar jets with velocity @xmath123 and an asymmetry @xmath124 .",
    "the large @xmath95 inferred for @xmath0  is a serious constraint on this scenario .",
    "if the disk extends to the star , we might expect jet velocities of @xmath125 as in ss443 , but only @xmath126 may accrete before one spins up to @xmath127s . with this mass , jet recoil gives a kick @xmath128km / s for @xmath0  s parameters , so that even a large jet asymmetry does not produce the desired momentum .",
    "perhaps more realistically , standard equilibrium spin - up arguments set @xmath129 cm .",
    "the keplerian period at this alfven radius is thus comparable to @xmath95 for @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 the eddington accretion rate .",
    "if as expected the star is born near a @xmath132ms break up period , the minimum mass needed to spin down the star to @xmath95 is @xmath133 , which gives a kick velocity @xmath134  km / s .",
    "@xmath0  is relatively slow with @xmath135  km / s and @xmath103ms , so we require an jet asymmetry @xmath136 .",
    "since the velocities are set at @xmath122 we see that slow spin goes with slow kick in this model .",
    "substantial jet asymmetries are required , but remain to be explained . of course , additional mass accreted while at equilibrium reduces the required @xmath124 .    with its large @xmath95 and small @xmath107",
    ", @xmath0  provides some of the strongest constraints on spin - kick physics .",
    "these important physics conclusions are presently based on rather limited data ; clearly better images confirming the torus and refining @xmath22 are needed .",
    "also , a radio interferometric proper motion can improve the velocity vector and get an independent kinematic measure of @xmath137 .",
    "such data should provide a new window on neutron star core collapse and its immediate aftermath .",
