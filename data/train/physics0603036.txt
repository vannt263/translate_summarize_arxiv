    "most of them are implemented with monte carlo simulations and as the number of names in a portfolio increases , the computational time increases .",
    "the factor approach uses a small number of latent factors that induce the default dependency @xcite .",
    "conditionally on the latent variables values , default events are independent .",
    "it becomes easy to calculate the loss ( default ) distribution function . along this line , some semi - explicit expressions of most relevant quantities",
    "were obtained @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , correlated binomial models were also proposed to describe the default dependency structures .",
    "the first one is a one - factor exchangeable version of creditrisk @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the aggregate loss distribution function is given by the beta - binomial distribution ( bbd ) .",
    "the second one is moody s correlated binomial default distribution model , which was introduced by witt @xcite .",

    "those of bbd decay with an increase in default .",
    "we are able to adapt a suitable form for the conditional correlations .",
    "recently it has become possible to calibrate @xmath1 from implied default distributions @xcite . by using the `` implied correlated '' binomial model ,",
    "whose conditional correlations are those of the implied distribution , it may become easy to estimate hedge ratios and so forth .",
    "the advantage of these correlated binomial models come from the fact that they are easier to evaluate than other more refined models .",
    "if a probabilistic model is implemented by a monte carlo simulation , the evaluation of the price of these derivatives consumes much computer time and the inverse process to obtain the model parameters becomes tedious work . with the above correlated binomial models , one can estimate the model parameters from the cdo premiums more easily .",
    "however , these models are formulated only for homogeneous portfolios , where the assets are exchangeable and they have the same default probability @xmath2 and default correlation @xmath3 .",
    "generalization to more realistic inhomogeneous portfolios where assets have different default probabilities and different default correlations should be done .    in this paper , we show how to generalize moody s correlated binomial default distribution ( mcb ) model to two types of inhomogeneous portfolios .",
    "our generalization method can be applied to other correlated binomial models , including implied correlated binomial distributions , by changing the condition on @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain the default probability function @xmath4 and examine the dependence of the expected loss rates of the tranches on the inhomogeneities . with the proposed model",
    ", we also estimate the implied values of the default correlation .",
    "comparison of the range of the tranche correlations with those of the gaussian copula model and bbd model are also performed .    about the organization in this paper , we start with a short review of moody s correlated binomial default distribution ( mcb ) model in . the dependence of @xmath5 on the number of defaults @xmath6 is compared with the bbd and gaussian copula . is the main part of the paper .",
