    "among all visible components of the galaxy , the stellar halo is the oldest and occupies the largest volume .",
    "it is therefore of interest both as a record of the early history of the galaxy and as a tracer of the galactic potential .",
    "the kinematics of halo stars in the solar neighborhood are well established , as shown in table  [ t : localhalo ] .",
    "for present purposes , the solar neighborhood extends as far as a few kpc from the sun , but to a distance less than the sun s own galactocentric radius . evidently , the systemic rotation @xmath6 of the local halo is small or zero , and the velocity ellipsoid is distinctly elongated in the radial direction .    the more distant halo has been less well studied .",
    "proper motions are generally not measurable for distant stars , so that line - of - sight velocities must be analyzed under _ a priori _ assumptions about the symmetries of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the stars are also fainter , reducing the accuracy of the measured quantities .",
    "much work on the distant halo has been done using globular clusters , which have the advantage of being distinctive and bright , but have important drawbacks : there are only @xmath7 of them , so that statistical uncertainties are large , and special conditions of formation or selective destruction by galactic tides may have biased the properties of the cluster system compared to those of the field .",
    "@xcite analyzed the kinematics of a sample of 66 globular clusters under the assumption that the systemic rotation @xmath6 is constant ; they concluded that the residual velocities are consistent with being isotropic within broad uncertainties .",
    "for a subsample of 44 metal - poor ( `` f '' ) clusters , they found @xmath8 and a root - mean - square ( rms ) residual line - of - sight velocity @xmath9 . in a similar analysis of clusters with @xmath10}<-0.8",
    "$ ] , @xcite found @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the restriction to low metallicities follows the discovery by @xcite that the more metal - rich clusters have a distribution and kinematics intermediate between those of the stellar halo and thin disk .",
    "@xcite sampled the halo field using relatively faint red giants at high galactic latitude .",
    "their summary for the more metal - poor stars near the south galactic pole concludes that @xmath13 is approximately constant at @xmath14 out to @xmath15 , which would be consistent with the solar neighborhood ( table  [ t : localhalo ] ) if the velocity ellipsoid is constant in cylindrical coordinates ; however , for their most distant subsample near the sgp ( @xmath16 ) , they measured @xmath17 ( 10 stars ) .    in a study similar to that reported here , @xcite analyzed a sample of 679 blue horizontal branch stars drawn from multiple sources and spanning galactocentric radii @xmath18 .",
    "with line - of - sight velocities and photometric distances , they found that the radial velocity dispersion ( in spherical coordinates ) falls rather sharply from its value in the solar neighborhood , @xmath19 , to an asymptotic value @xmath20 at @xmath21 . by requiring dynamical equilibrium in an assumed logarithmic galactic potential",
    ", they concluded that the tangential velocity dispersion should rise from its local value to @xmath22 at large @xmath23 .",
    "they did not claim , however , to have detected this rise directly in their data .",
    "they further suggested that the shift from radial to tangential anisotropy with increasing galactocentric radius might support theories in which the halo formed by heirarchical merging of smaller systems .    because of the differences in kinematics cited above",
    ", it appears that local high - velocity , low - metallicity stars may not be entirely representative of the more distant halo . to study the more distant halo , we have isolated a sample of @xmath0 blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars from the sloan digital sky survey ( * ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in that paper , we estimated contamination from foreground stars and blue stragglers to be less than @xmath24 for bright stars ( @xmath25 ) and about @xmath26 for faint stars ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "an improved color - absolute magnitude relation was also derived , and these absolute magnitudes are used throughout this paper to derive distance moduli .",
    "this sample of bhb stars provides effective tracers of the galactic halo , with no kinematic bias .",
    "the sample may have selection bias , and is probably far from complete , but these biases do not affect the kinematic analyses presented in this paper other than degrading the statistics and increasing the errors . using maximum - likelihood methods , we fit for the mean rotation and principle axes of the halo velocity ellipsoid on the assumption that these are constant in spherical or cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we also fit for the orbital velocity of the sun .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss an overview of the kinematic analysis in ",
    "[ s : ve_overview ] and appendix  [ s : maxlike ] .",
    "the results for the kinematic parameters of the halo are presented in ",
    "[ s : ve_results ] and summarized in table  [ t : results ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations which validate the analysis are presented in ",
    "[ s : montecarlo ] . ",
    "[ s : discussion ] summarizes our main conclusions and discusses the agenda for future work .      the following terminology and conventions are used throughout this work .",
    "a heliocentric right - handed cartesian coordinate system @xmath28 is oriented so that @xmath29 points towards the galactic center ( gc ) and @xmath30 points towards the north galactic pole , such that @xmath31 is the direction of disk rotation .",
    "thus , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . the velocity of the lsr is taken to be @xmath34 @xcite , and the canonical solar motion vector is @xmath35 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rounded to integer values ) .",
    "galactocentric spherical @xmath36 and cylindrical @xmath37 coordinate systems will also be used .",
    "we make a rudimentary model of halo bulk rotation parametrized by a single velocity @xmath6 .",
    "a positive @xmath6 indicates a flat halo rotation curve in the same sense as the disk rotation .",
    "radial velocities to stars are measured as redshifts which are subsequently and immediately corrected for the earth s motion around the sun and the earth s rotation about its own axis .",
    "this heliocentric radial velocity @xmath38 contains a component due to the solar velocity @xmath39 . ''",
    "is used for components along the line of sight , but elsewhere it will be used for the radial component in spherical coordinates based on the galactic center .",
    "the context should make our meaning clear . ]",
    "the `` line - of - sight '' velocity @xmath40 will be defined as @xmath38 plus the projection of @xmath39 onto the line - of - sight to the star , minus the projection of its expected rotation component @xmath41 ( if any ) .",
    "that is , @xmath40 is the component of the purely random component of velocity in a model of the halo with a flat rotation curve , projected onto the line of sight .",
    "we find @xmath42 conceptually useful , but one should not forget that it is contingent upon our assumptions concerning the rotation of the sun and the halo , whereas @xmath38 is directly observed ( modulo errors ) .",
    "throughout , the distance from the sun to the gc is assumed to be @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is defined such that its axes align with the principal axes of the velocity dispersion tensor , and the lengths of its axes @xmath44 are equal to the components of the velocity dispersion along those directions .",
    "it is difficult to know the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid so it is reasonable to assume it is oriented along galactocentric spherical or cylindrical coordinates at every point in space @xcite . even with @xmath45 stars , it is difficult to assess whether and how the components of the velocity ellipsoid vary in space , so they are assumed constant , although we test this below by dividing our sample into a few magnitude bins .",
    "a maximum likelihood technique is used , as outlined in appendix  [ s : maxlike ] .",
    "a uniform prior is adopted @xcite : when the probability of observing the set of stars at the observed positions and heliocentric radial velocities given an assumed @xmath44 is maximized as a function of @xmath44 , the probability of @xmath44 being the true velocity ellipsoid is maximized . in symbols ,",
    "@xmath46 where @xmath47 represents probability density .",
    "naturally , @xmath48 depends implicitly upon the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid with respect to the line of sight , and hence upon the angular position @xmath49 and distance of each star .",
    "it is straightfoward to expand the maximum likelihood procedure to include four additional parameters : the three components of the velocity of the sun with respect to the galactic center , @xmath39 , and the bulk rotation velocity of the halo , @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the bulk rotation of the halo corresponds to a uniform velocity in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "it is difficult to apply this analysis on this sample to more complex halo rotation laws because of the moderate degeneracy between the halo rotation and @xmath50 ( see  figure  [ f : ve_conf ] , discussed below ) ; this degeneracy would increase if one attempted to fit for more parameters of the bulk halo rotation .",
    "distance moduli are derived from the color - absolute magnitude relation of paper  i. the measured angular coordinates of the stars @xmath51 are virtually error - free .",
    "however , the magnitudes , and thus distances , are susceptible to several sources of error : extinction , photon statistics , and intrinsic brightness variations from star to star which create deviations in the stars distance moduli .",
    "therefore , magnitude errors should be included in the likelihood analysis .",
    "as shown in paper  i , typical magnitude errors are about @xmath52 . in anticipation of our finding , discussed below in  [ s : ve_results ] , that the kinematic analysis is very robust with respect to magnitude errors , we adopt an even more conservative magnitude error : @xmath53 , and assume the errors follow a gaussian distribution . equation  [ e : probability ] shows the probability density @xmath47 of observing a star at a given position in space , line of sight velocity @xmath40 , and @xmath44 .",
    "having assumed that magnitude errors have a gaussian distribution with some width @xmath54 , the likelihood of observing a star considering magnitude errors can be found by integrating the probability density of equation  [ e : probability ] , multiplied by a gaussian weight function for the magnitude error , along the line of sight .",
    "figure  [ f : gh_demo ] shows an illustration of this procedure for two stars with artificial data .",
    "these two stars are constructed to have @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and absolute magnitude @xmath57 , which places them approximately 9 kpc from the sun above the galactic center .",
    "the evaluation of the probability density @xmath47 for each star alone along the line of sight is shown in the upper right panel .",
    "one star s line - of - sight velocity is @xmath58 ( solid line and filled dots ) and the other s is @xmath59 ( dotted line and open circles )",
    ". we apply @xmath60 ( spherical coordinates ) to this model ( note that the @xmath47 component of the velocity ellipsoid is irrelevant for this particular case ) .",
    "it is easy to see several trends in the upper right plot of figure  [ f : gh_demo ] .",
    "if there were no distance measurement , for example , the stationary star would be most likely to be found at @xmath61 because the line of sight coincides there with the smallest ( @xmath62 ) axis of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "in fact , the probability density of observing a stationary star at that point is just @xmath63 , as shown .",
    "also , the receding star is least likely to be observed there because its @xmath40 can most easily be `` explained '' by most of its contribution coming from the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "also note that the stationary star always has a higher probability than the receding star ; this follows from the gaussian nature of the probability of observing @xmath40 in equation  [ e : probability ] .    to incorporate the magnitude error @xmath54 into the analysis , the probability density @xmath47 as a function of distance",
    "must be multiplied by a gaussian centered on the measured magnitude with width @xmath54 , and then integrated over distance .",
    "this integration is most easily accomplished with gauss - hermite integration , which samples @xmath47 at @xmath64 points , shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ f : gh_demo ] as dots and circles .",
    "these 11 values of @xmath47 at the specified abscissae are multiplied by the coresponding weight factors @xmath65 @xcite , which are plotted in a discrete fashion as the lower line in the middle panel of figure  [ f : gh_demo ] .",
    "the consideration of magnitude errors also introduces malmquist bias .",
    "if the number density of observable bhb stars in the galactic halo follows a spherical power law @xmath66 in galactocentric radius , then malmquist factor @xmath67 must weight the probability density @xmath47 , in addition to the gaussian weight @xmath65 due to the magnitude error , where @xmath68 is heliocentric distance .",
    "these weighting factors are normalized so that @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath70 is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ f : gh_demo ] as the top line , assuming @xmath71 .",
    "note that for @xmath72 , @xmath73 .    finally , the probability density of observing a star at a given angular position , distance modulus , and line - of - sight velocity , with assumptions on @xmath44 , @xmath54 and @xmath74 for the malmquist term , is just @xmath75 .",
    "the term @xmath76 is plotted in the lower panel of figure  [ f : gh_demo ] for our two fictitious stars ; again the stationary star is the solid line and the receding star is the dotted line .",
    "when these terms are summed over @xmath77 , we arrive at new determinations for the probability density of observing the star , indicated in the upper right panel of figure  [ f : gh_demo ] by the horizontal lines .",
    "the original estimate of @xmath47 was given by the middle dot and circle ( at @xmath78 ) , so it is evident that the `` hill '' and the `` dip '' in @xmath79 for the two stars are responsible for modifying the original estimate of @xmath47 up or down in the correct direction .    the quantity @xmath74 for the halo is usually taken to be between about 3 and 3.5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the kinematic analysis below we assume @xmath71 , following the study of horizontal branch stars of @xcite .",
    "however , we find our results are fairly insensitive to @xmath74 ; even @xmath80 results only in small changes to our final results .",
    "another possible source of measurement error is in the radial velocities .",
    "as determined in paper  i , typical velocity errors may be as high as @xmath81 . according to equation  [ e : probability ]",
    ", the probability density of observing a star at a certain line - of - sight velocity @xmath40 ( with respect to the gc ) follows a gaussian distribution , centered on @xmath58 , with a dispersion @xmath82 that depends on geometry and @xmath44 .",
    "thus the probability density of observing the star at @xmath40 considering a possible velocity error that follows a gaussian distribution with dispersion @xmath83 is just @xmath84 note this reduces to the original equation  [ e : probability ] as @xmath85 .",
    "we have discussed the various modifications available to the maximum likelihood technique . in summary , they are the following :    * subsample .",
    "although we first determine the velocity ellipsoid using all stars , we can extract subsamples , specifically in certain magnitude bins , to investigate whether the velocity ellipsoid is a function of position in space .",
    "* spherical or cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the choice affects the values of @xmath86 in the maximum likelihood procedure but is otherwise straightfoward . * magnitude errors .",
    "we either ignore magnitude errors or else use 11-point gauss - hermite integration with @xmath53 and @xmath71 .",
    "* velocity errors .",
    "we either ignore velocity errors or else use equation  [ e : verror ] with @xmath87 . *",
    "number of fitting parameters .",
    "several combinations of fitting parameters are used .",
    "we fit the three @xmath44 parameters keeping @xmath88 at canonical values ; we fit @xmath89 keeping @xmath39 at its canonical values ; and we also fit all seven parameters simultaneously .",
    "table  [ t : results ] contains the determinations of @xmath90 for several combinations of model assumptions discussed above ; the first four columns describe these model assumptions .",
    "the first column states what criteria were used to select subsets of bhb stars from the total set of @xmath0 bhb stars , and the number of stars in each subset is listed in the second column .",
    "the third column indicates whether a cylindrical or spherical geometry was assumed .",
    "the fourth column indicates how errors were handled ; `` 0 '' indicates that errors were not considered . as described in ",
    "[ s : ve_overview ] , `` m '' indicates that 11-point gauss - hermite integration was used with @xmath53 , and `` v '' indicates that velocity errors were considered with @xmath91 .",
    "the following columns show the parameter determinations .",
    "all determinations in table  [ t : results ] are for the three - parameter fit with @xmath92 fixed at canonical values @xcite as shown , except for the second and third lines which fit four and seven parameters , respectively .",
    "the quoted errors consider correlations among the parameters , and the errors in parentheses do not consider the correlations .",
    "the former error is defined as @xmath93 and the latter as @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the diagonal elements of the second - derivative matrix of the log - likelihood function , and @xmath96 represents the diagonal elements of the inverse of that matrix .    the first row in table  [ t : results ] shows the results for the velocity ellipsoid for the complete sample ( @xmath97 ) in spherical coordinates , with no magnitude or velocity errors considered .",
    "the sun s velocity was fixed at the canonical value of @xmath98 @xcite . under these assumptions",
    "all three components of the velocity ellipsoid are about @xmath99 .",
    "the second row in table  [ t : results ] shows the results of simultaneously fitting @xmath6 and @xmath44 to the same sample and otherwise same set of assumptions discussed above .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid has essentially the same determined values , and the rotation velocity of the halo is consistent with zero . the third row in table  [ t : results ] is the seven parameter fit to the sample .",
    "again , the velocity ellipsoid is essentially the same , and the rotation velocity of the halo is seen to be marginally consistent with zero .",
    "reassuringly , the velocity of the sun with respect to the galactic halo in the @xmath100 direction ( or equivalently , the sun s velocity in an inertial frame assuming the halo is actually non - rotating ) is close to the expected value : @xmath101 .",
    "the error follows from rotating the eigenvectors by @xmath102 and is smaller than either error for @xmath50 or @xmath6 because the two quantities are strongly covariant .",
    "the @xmath103 and @xmath104 directions of @xmath39 are new measurements of the solar motion @xmath105 .",
    "our value of @xmath106 is consistent with that of @xcite ; however our value of @xmath107 differs by several @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ f : ve_conf ] shows confidence regions for the components of the velocity ellipsoid for this case .",
    "each panel in figure  [ f : ve_conf ] is a two - dimensional parameter space where the other five parameters are held at their determined values and assumed to have symmetric errors , so the confidence regions are only approximatations to those one would obtain by integrating over the other five dimensions .",
    "note that @xmath109 is very well constrained .",
    "this is because the typical distance to the halo stars in our sample is large compared to the distance from the sun to the galactic center , so measurements of @xmath40 from earth very nearly align with direct measurements of the galactocentric radial component of velocity .",
    "also , each component of the velocity ellipsoid is anticorrelated with the other two ; this demonstrates an intuitive `` conservation law '' of velocities . in the lower left panel",
    ", it is apparent that @xmath6 and @xmath50 are correlated , so that the quantity @xmath110 is more tightly constrained than either quantity alone .",
    "this of course follows from the reasonable assumption that the halo rotation at the location of the sun is in the @xmath100 direction .",
    "the result that @xmath111 contrasts with most estimates of the velocity ellipsoid based on stellar samples in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "we now investigate some other sets of assumptions that may influence the results .",
    "the fourth line in table  [ t : results ] introduces magnitude errors into the set of assumptions .",
    "these errors , at least in our implementation of a gaussian with width @xmath53 , apparently have little effect on the final results .",
    "note that for a given kinematic model , distance affects the distribution of @xmath40 only through the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid with respect to the line of sight .",
    "if the dispersions were isotropic and the halo nonrotating , which seem to be nearly the case , then @xmath40 would be independent of distance .",
    "this may explain the insensitivity to magnitude errors .",
    "the fifth line in table  [ t : results ] incorporates both magnitude and velocity errors .",
    "again , the final results are seen to remain relatively constant ; however the values of the velocity ellipsoid components decrease modestly . in light of equation  [ e : probability ] ,",
    "the probability of observing a star at a certain velocity @xmath40 is always higher for smaller values of @xmath112 ; thus velocity errors tend to `` favor '' smaller velocities , which propagate to the smaller values of the velocity ellipsoid . however , the effect is small , of order @xmath113 .",
    "the next three lines in table  [ t : results ] show three - parameter determinations for the complete sample of bhb stars assuming the velocity ellipsoid is oriented along cylindrical coordinates . as for the spherical",
    "coordinates case , all three components of the velocity ellipsoid are still about @xmath99",
    ".    determinations for cylindrical scenarios incorporating magnitude and velocity errors are shown in the tables , and as before , do not appear to affect the final results appreciably .",
    "since velocity errors behave in a predictable way and have little effect on our final results , and magnitude errors have no noticable effect , we do not consider these errors further .",
    "it should be remembered that our error estimate was based on a set of highly simplified , and perhaps dubious , assumptions that do not take into account systematic errors , for instance .    in the following rows in table  [ t : results ] the sample of stars is modified .",
    "there are @xmath114 stars with @xmath115 , so these stars extend from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "the sample with @xmath118 contains the @xmath119 brightest stars ( distances out to @xmath120 ) .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is seen to remain remarkably constant down to distances from the sun only marginally outside the coverage of previous surveys ( e.g. , @xmath121 for the sample of @xcite ) .",
    "the most intriguing result is that the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid @xmath109 ( or @xmath122 in cylindrical coordinates ) just outside the solar neighborhood is significantly smaller than the canonical value of @xmath123 in the solar neighborhood ( table  [ t : localhalo ] ) .",
    "this incompatibility will be further discussed in  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "the sample with @xmath124 contains the @xmath125 faintest stars .",
    "since the stars are all very far away , the non - radial components of the velocity ellipsoid are very poorly constrained .",
    "note that the quoted errors may also be ill - determined because of departures from gaussianity for small eigenvalues .",
    "however , the essential result remains the same : the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid is @xmath126 .    finally , to address concerns that the determination of the velocity ellipsoid may be contaminated by halo substructure , the last two lines of table  [ t : results ] show the results for all stars excluding the sagittarius stream .",
    "this exclusion is conservatively accomplished by simply rejecting all bhb stars within 10 degrees of the great circle with pole @xmath127 , which approximates the sagittarius stream ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) .",
    "since the sagittarius stream is the most conspicuous substructure in our sample of bhb stars ( paper  i ) , the stability of the velocity ellipsoid solution indicates that halo substructure does not appreciably influence the results .",
    "an independent way of verifying the accuracy of the maximum likelihood technique is through monte carlo simulations . in case",
    "the geometry of the sdss footprint ( see paper  i ) affects the analysis , we assemble @xmath0 artificial stars with the same angular coordinates and measured @xmath128 magnitudes as the complete bhb sample , but with newly constructed velocities . for simplicity",
    "absolute magnitudes are assumed constant at @xmath57 .",
    "only velocity ellipsoids aligned with spherical coordinates will be considered here .",
    "these monte carlo simulations perform the three - parameter fit to the velocity ellipsoid with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "note , however , that the values of @xmath39 and @xmath6 are irrelevant here since they are first added to the stars velocities in construction , and then subtracted as known in the parameter determination .",
    "we run 100 monte carlo simulations on each of four setups .",
    "the first setup does not consider magnitude or velocity errors ; the second setup allows for @xmath53 ; the third assumes @xmath87 .",
    "the fourth setup considers the magnitude and velocity errors as well as allowing for contamination .",
    "the constructed set of artificial stars has known space positions , so it is straightforward to apply an assumed velocity ellipsoid to obtain a simulated three - dimensional space velocity for each star .",
    "here we assume @xmath131 to strain the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the three - dimensional velocities are then projected onto the line of sight to each star to obtain @xmath40 , and then the projections of @xmath39 and @xmath6 are subtracted to obtain @xmath38 .",
    "this comprises the simulated data set for the first setup . to incorporate magnitude errors , the radial distances to the stars",
    "are shuffled , i.e. the @xmath128 magnitudes are shifted by a gaussian error distribution of width @xmath54 , @xmath38 is calculated as before , and then the @xmath128 magnitudes are shifted back to their `` observed '' positions .",
    "velocity errors are incorporated by adding an error to each observed @xmath38 . to incorporate contamination ,",
    "a fraction of stars are randomly flagged as disk stars .",
    "these stars are then assumed to be 2.5 times closer ( 2 mag ) to the sun than they would be if they were bhb stars .",
    "their velocities are taken to be @xmath132 in the @xmath133 direction plus three random components from a _ disk _ velocity dispersion , which is assumed isotropic with components @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite find a non - isotropic disk velocity dispersion with components of the same order ( depending on color ) , but our intent is to contaminate the simulated halo star population in a simple and controlled way .    figure  [ f : ve_mc ] shows the results of these monte carlo simulations with the four setups colored black ( no errors ) , blue ( magnitude errors ) , red ( velocity errors ) , and green ( magnitude and velocity errors with 10% contamination ) . as shown , the scatter in the results of the monte carlo simulations is comparable to the confidence regions shown in figure  [ f : ve_conf ] , so our error analysis is verified to be reasonable . as in the analysis of the real data ,",
    "the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid @xmath109 is very well constrained ; one can also see anticorrelation between any two components .",
    "the black dots and blue dots occupy essentially the same region of parameter space ; this verifies , independently of the method used in ",
    "[ s : ve_results ] , that magnitude errors of the order @xmath54 do not affect our results significantly .",
    "as shown in table  [ t : mc_meanrms ] , the mean determinations of @xmath44 over 100 monte carlo simulations recover the input values for the `` no errors '' case and the `` magnitude errors only '' case .",
    "it is also clear that velocity errors of scale @xmath87 push the measured values higher by @xmath135 because the error adds in quadrature .",
    "this result is consistent with the independent determination in  [ s : ve_results ] which stated that with @xmath87 the `` true '' values of the velocity ellipsoid ( i.e. , those measured using the analysis that allows for velocity errors ) were @xmath135 lower than the `` measured '' values ( not considering velocity errors ) .",
    "finally , it is interesting that for the case which includes contamination by disk stars , the determination of @xmath136 increases while those of @xmath109 and @xmath137 both decrease .",
    "this is because the disk stars are constructed to travel primarily in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "however , the main conclusion to be gained from these monte carlo simulations is that the radial component of the velocity ellipsoid never strays too far from its correct value of @xmath138 , even allowing for errors such as contamination .",
    "thus the maximum likelihood analysis is verified to be reliable and stable .",
    "applying maximum - likelihood methods to the line - of - sight velocities and photometric distances of bhb stars , we have modeled the kinematics of the relatively distant galactic halo .",
    "( the median distance of the sample is about @xmath15 . )",
    "no significant anisotropy of the velocity ellipsoid is detected . in a model aligned with spherical coordinates , for example , @xmath139 .",
    "however , the errors in @xmath140 and @xmath141 are much larger , @xmath142 , than that of @xmath109 , because of the great distances of most stars : that is , the galactocentric radius @xmath143 of most stars is more than twice that of the sun , so that the direction of the line of sight is not far from radial despite the broad angular range of our sample .",
    "this result contrasts starkly and surprisingly with the radial anisotropy of halo velocities in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath144 ; see table  [ t : localhalo ] ) .",
    "our results are consistent , however , with the only other comparable study of distant halo field stars : @xcite .",
    "we are able to fit separately for the rotation speed of the halo ( @xmath6 ) and the orbital velocity of the sun , although the two are strongly covariant .",
    "the halo rotation is marginally consistent with zero at the one - sigma level , which is @xmath145 .",
    "the difference @xmath146 is more tightly constrained than either quantity separately .",
    "this is consistent with a non - rotating halo if one accepts the iau recommendation for the local standard of rest , @xmath147 @xcite and @xcite s solar motion , @xmath148 , although some authors have advocated a substantially smaller @xcite or larger @xcite value of the azimuthal component of @xmath149 .",
    "( if the solar rotation _ is _ substantially less than @xmath150 , then according to our results , the halo should counterrotate ! )",
    "our result is also statistically consistent with most of the studies cited in table  [ t : localhalo ] , although the latter seem to prefer a slight positive halo rotation .",
    "note that what those studies actually measure is the mean velocity of local halo stars relative to the sun ; the values for @xmath151 in the fourth column of that table have been adjusted to @xmath152 so that they can be compared directly to our result .",
    "presumably , @xmath149 will soon be determined with exquisite accuracy by a variant of the classical visual - binary method applied to stars orbiting sgr  @xmath153 , but accurate values are not in the public domain at the time of writing @xcite .",
    "of course , the measurement of @xmath6 depends upon the assumption that the halo rotation curve is flat ; line - of - sight velocities would be unaffected by adding a solid - body component to the angular velocity of the halo , although proper motions would be ( see below ) .",
    "these are the main results of our study .",
    "it is likely that more science could be extracted from this sample , and completion of the sdss will allow it to be enlarged . for the present , we simply highlight certain interesting features of the data that have not yet been thoroughly explored .    the distribution of @xmath40 is plotted in figure  [ f : vlos_dist ] and beautifully follows a gaussian of width @xmath154 .",
    "the uncertainty quoted here is one - sigma statistical , to which should be added a similar systematic uncertainty pending better quantification of our measurement errors .",
    "an estimate of this systematic error is easily determined as @xmath155 ( @xmath156 from paper  i ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities ( figure  [ f : vlos_dist ] ) are about as gaussianly distributed as the number of stars would allow .",
    "this is consistent with ( although not required by ) the isotropy of the velocity ellipsoid that we find , since a strongly anisotropic ellipsoid , even if gaussian along each individual axis , would not produce an exact gaussian in an average over many lines of sight .",
    "gaussianity could result from large observational errors , regardless of the intrinsic velocity distribution , if the errors were gaussian , but our errors seem not to be large enough to dominate the observed distribution ( paper  i ) . by contrast , the distribution of transverse velocities of halo stars in the solar neighborhood is distinctly nongaussian , with a negative kurtosis @xcite .",
    "this is another indication that the local halo differs from the more distant halo probed by our bhb sample .",
    "another aspect of the data that could be thoroughly explored is the smoothness of the bhb phase - space distribution .",
    "the notion of a stellar velocity ellipsoid implicitly presumes that phase space is smoothly populated .",
    "if instead the distribution is very lumpy and the number of important lumps or streams is small , then statistical characterizations of _ individual _ halos , in particular that of the galaxy , may not be meaningful . in cosmology , however , statistical descriptions are unavoidable .",
    "current theory holds that galactic halos have been built up by accretion of lesser systems @xcite .",
    "accreted gas joins galactic disks , and the details of its history are effaced by dissipation .",
    "stars that form in these systems before they are accreted ( and presumably also their dark matter ) , however , behave collisionlessly and preserve a partial record of their origins .",
    "the structure of the stellar and dark - matter halos should be related .",
    "@xcite conclude from a detailed analysis and scaling of cosmological simulations that the number of streams composing a halo similar to that of the galaxy should be large , amounting to almost @xmath157 within @xmath15 , and that most streams joined the galaxy early on , allowing more time for phase mixing .",
    "the number of our bhb stars is much smaller than this , so that one might expect to find a smooth distribution .",
    "and yet we see structure in our sample that is consistent with the tidal stream of the sagittarius dwarf ( paper  i ) , as previously delineated in sdss data @xcite and in a survey of carbon stars @xcite .",
    "most of our results for the halo velocity ellipsoid are scarcely affected by excluding that part of the sample that lies close to the sagittarius stream on the sky . in short ,",
    "it is not yet clear whether the kinematics of the galactic halo admit a statistical decription .",
    "larger samples of stars will be necessary to clarify this .    in paper",
    "i , we used proper motions only as a check on the purity of our sample .",
    "calibration against the qsos shows that the proper motions of individual bhb stars in our sample are smaller than measurement errors by factors @xmath158 , but statistical detection of the kinematics of the population as a whole should certainly be possible . among other benefits",
    ", this would allow a direct constraint on the solid - body component of halo rotation and a further test of the isotropy of the velocity dispersions .",
    "systematic errors in the proper motion data present many complexities , however , so we defer their analysis to a later paper .",
    "the quality of the usno - b data should be appreciably better than that of the usno - a , and one should probably use the former to determine the proper motions of sdss objects .",
    "our bhb radial velocity data could be used to constrain the mass of the outer galaxy .",
    "we have not yet attempted a serious dynamical analysis , partly in order to do full justice to the kinematics , but also because mass measurements rely more heavily on aspects of the data that are less certain : namely , the photometric distances and the completeness as a function of magnitude . however , since no kinematic information was used in the selection of the sample , we may assume that the velocities fairly represent the whole population of bhb stars , whose spatial density is often described as a powerlaw in galactocentric radius , @xmath159 , with exponent @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "in that case , to the extent that the dispersions are isotropic and constant with radius and rotation is negligible , and that the potential is spherical , jeans equations imply @xmath161 the value of @xmath162 so obtained , with @xmath163 , is substantially lower than the circular velocity in the vicinity of the sun . faced with similar evidence drawn from their own independent bhb sample ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the tangential velocity dispersion of the halo probably rises beyond @xmath164 so as to exceed the radial dispersion and be consistent with a constant circular velocity . at such distances , however , the tangential dispersions are very poorly constrained by line - of - sight velocities without _ a priori _ assumptions about the potential ( see table  [ t : results ] ) .",
    "rather than make such assumptions , one may prefer to await further direct evidence .",
