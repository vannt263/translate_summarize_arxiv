    "the response function can be measured by applying a weak field at a particular site at time @xmath23 and monitoring subsequent spin flips caused by the field at distance @xmath24 at some later time @xmath25 . since in disordered ferromagnetic ising model with heat bath dynamics a positive external field @xmath26 can only turn spins up but never down , the response function is strictly positive in the present case .",
    "ageing phenomena are characterised by dynamical scaling .",
    "this postulate implies that the response function obeys the scaling form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a scaling function and @xmath29 during the past decade there have been various attempts to generalise the concept of dynamical and anisotropic scaling to some kind of local scale invariance  @xcite , in a similar sense as conformal invariance generalises global scale invariance of two - dimensional equilibrium phase transitions to local scale transformations .",
    "such theories of local scale invariance ( lsi ) together with explicit representations of its generators make non - trivial predictions about the specific form of scaling functions .",
    "recently , lsi was developed further as to include systems with @xmath30  @xcite .",

    "@xcite applied this generalised version of lsi to the disordered ferromagnetic ising model , finding the predictions in good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "in contrast to these results , the aim of the present work is    1 .   to show that the predictions of generalised lsi , as quoted in  @xcite , are in principle incompatible with the actual response function of the disordered ising model , 2 .   to demonstrate this incompatibility numerically by a _",
    "direct _ measurement of the response function , 3 .   to suggest an alternative approach with",

    "a similar discussion concerning the application of lsi to critical directed percolation without quenched disorder can be found in refs .",
    "according to henkel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite the generalised version of lsi makes the following predictions :    1 .   the scaling function @xmath28 _ factorises _ into two parts @xmath31 where we may choose @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   the first factor in this expression , which determines the form of the autoresponse @xmath33 , again factorises into two power laws of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a proportionality constant",
    ", @xmath36 is another exponent which is generally different from @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the so - called autoresponse exponent .",
    "the second factor , which determines the spatial profile of the response , can be expressed as an integral @xmath39 parametrised by a dimensionful non - universal parameter @xmath40 and another exponent  @xmath41 .",
    "baumann _ et al .",
    "_ tested these predictions indirectly by measuring the integrated spatio - temporal response and autocorrelation function , finding a convincing agreement .",
    "however , this result is surprising because the integral reminds of a lvy - stable distribution generated by anomalous diffusion .",
    "such distributions are expected to occur in systems with algebraically distributed long - range interactions _ in space _",
    ", typically in the range @xmath42 . the present model , however , does not fall into this category because all interactions are local .",
    "it is this disturbing discrepancy which motivated the present work .    in the following",
    "we demonstrate that integral expression  ( [ integralexpression ] ) is _ in principle _ incompatible with the response function of the disordered ising model in 2d evolving by heat bath dynamics . to see this",
    ", one has to evaluate the integral  ( [ integralexpression ] ) in two dimensions using polar coordinates @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the remaining integral can be evaluated exactly for certain rational values of @xmath3 . as an example",
    "let us consider the special case @xmath45 .",
    "here we obtain the result @xmath46 where @xmath47 are generalised hypergeometric functions . inserting the numerically determined values @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath49 reported in  @xcite , this function displays an oscillatory behaviour , becoming negative for certain values of  @xmath50 .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the response function of the disordered ferromagnetic ising model evolving by heat bath dynamics is strictly positive .",
    "hence we can conclude that the predictions of lsi , as expressed by eq .",

    "[ fig : lsifailure ] shows the numerically measured profile and the analytical profile predicted by lsi .",
    "as can be seen , the profiles differ significantly .",
    "in the following i suggest an alternative approach which is guided by phenomenological arguments in the spirit of paul , puri and rieger  @xcite . starting point is the observation that it makes a big difference whether a local perturbation by an external field flips a spin in the interior of an ordered domain or a spin adjacent to a domain wall . in the interior of a domain",
    "the generated minority island shrinks extremely fast driven by surface tension so that its contribution to the response function is extremely short - ranged in time and can be neglected .",
    "spin flips at the boundaries , however , may displace a domain wall and thus have a much longer life time . in other words , the response to a local perturbation is always confined to the domain walls and thus propagates in the same way as the domain walls move in space . without quenched disorder , the domain walls propagate and merge diffusively , hence the local perturbation spreads in space like a random walk , leading to a gaussian profile .",
    "quenched disorder changes the dynamics of the domain walls drastically . in particular , domain walls in a disordered environment may be pinned along lines of strongly coupled sites  @xcite .",
    "such a pinned domain wall remains immobile for a certain waiting time . in a scale - free system",
    "it is reasonable to assume that these waiting times @xmath57 are algebraically distributed as @xmath58 with @xmath59 , leading effectively to a subdiffusive dynamics . with this physical picture in mind",
    "it is near at hand to conjecture that the response to a local perturbation in a disordered ferromagnet spreads essentially in the same way as a short - ranged random walk with algebraically distributed waiting times between subsequent random moves .    to solve this problem ,",

    "* + i would like to thank m. henkel for interesting discussions and useful comments .",
    "i also thank the referees for pointing out related work .",
    "previous studies on the homogeneous ising model have shown that the integrated response is not a suitable quantity to detect deviations from lsi , instead one has to measure the full response function .",
    "a direct measurement of the response function is notoriously difficult to perform because of strong fluctuations . as a way out , chatelain proposed to relate the response function to a certain correlation function measured in a system without external field  @xcite .",
    "based on this idea several authors devised powerful algorithms to measure the response function in the ising model  @xcite .    here",
    "i present an alternative algorithm for the ising model with standard heat bath dynamics , where perturbations at _ all _ sites are processed simultaneously  a trick which allows one to obtain reasonable statistical averages within short time .",
    "a similar algorithm was already used for the contact process ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present case",
    "the algorithm is somewhat more complicated , as will be explained in the following .",
    "however , the algorithm is conceptually simpler as previous approaches in so far as it measures the response function directly without relying on the non - trivial proof by chatelain .",
    "the standard kinetic ising model with heat bath dynamics is defined as follows .",
    "each site @xmath9 of a @xmath87-dimensional lattice is associated with classical variables @xmath88 which represents the orientation of a local spin .",
    "initially the system is prepared in a disordered state , where all spins independently take the values @xmath89 with equal probability .",
    "then , starting at time @xmath90 , the system evolves at finite temperature @xmath91 by random - sequential updates according to the following dynamical rules :    * select a random site @xmath9 . *",
    "calculate the local field @xmath92 , where @xmath93 runs over the @xmath94 nearest neighbours of site @xmath9 , respecting the chosen boundary conditions . *",
    "generate a random number @xmath95 and set @xmath96    as usual in models with random sequential updates , the time variable @xmath62 is incremented by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the total number of sites .",
    "obviously , the third step can be reformulated equivalently as follows :    * define a threshold field @xmath99 where @xmath95 is a random number , and set @xmath100    as we will see below , this formulation of the update rule is more convenient for a measurement of the autoresponse function .    in order to measure the autoresponse function @xmath101",
    "directly we would have to apply a weak external field @xmath102 at time @xmath23 locally at a randomly chosen site  @xmath9 and to study how much the ensemble average of the local magnetisation @xmath103 at a different site  @xmath93 changes at some later time @xmath25 .",
    "however , such a measurement is hard to perform since a localised weak field leads only to occasional spin flips in the future so that the average response to such a _ single _ spin flip is hard to quantify .",
    "this is probably the reason why most researches avoid a direct measurement of the autoresponse function and prefer to study the integrated response . in the kinetic ising model , however , there are two ways to optimise a direct measurement , namely by ( i )  reweighting the probability of spin flips and ( ii ) simultaneous tagging of all spins in the system .",
    "the algorithm suggested here seems to have a comparable performance as previously applied algorithms without external field based on the paper by chatelain  @xcite moreover , it relies partially on the same ideas ( see below ) .",
    "it would be interesting to compare these algorithms systematically .",
    "* ( i ) reweighting spin flip probabilities * + the first idea is to study the response of an infinitely strong external perturbation instead of a weak one and to extract the limit @xmath104 by an appropriate reweighting procedure .",
    "reweighting is a standard technique in monte - carlo simulations to enhance the efficiency  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "starting point is the observation that in heat bath dynamics as described above a weak perturbation by a positive localised external field @xmath105 changes the probability to get a positively oriented spin @xmath106 to lowest order as @xmath107\\bigr ) & = & \\nonumber \\frac12\\bigl(1+\\tanh\\bigl[\\beta h_j\\bigr]\\bigr ) + \\bigl ( \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\cosh^{-2}[\\beta h_j]\\bigr ) h_j^{\\rm ( ext)}\\\\ & & + \\mathcal{o}([h_j^{\\rm ( ext)}]^2)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we may equivalently turn up the spin @xmath108 with 100% probability and compensate this intervention by weighting the resulting response in the ensemble average by the corresponding first - order coefficient .",
    "thus , the reweighting scheme consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "select random site @xmath9 at time @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   define a weight @xmath109 , where @xmath92 is the local field caused by the nearest neighbours of site @xmath9 at time @xmath23 , and store them in the memory .",
    "3 .   set @xmath110 by force .",
    "4 .   measure how much this modification increases the magnetisation at site @xmath93 at some later time @xmath25 .",
    "multiply the measured response by the weight factor @xmath111 and then perform the average over many independent realisations .",
    "* ( ii ) simultaneous tagging of all possible spin flips caused by an external field * even with the reweighting procedure described above the measurement of the autoresponse function is still difficult to perform since the response to a perturbation at a _ single _ site is quite small and fluctuates strongly .",
    "however , in the special case of the ising model with heat bath dynamics it is possible to study the response to a perturbation of _ all _ spins simultaneously .",
    "the reason is that for a given set of random numbers used in the simulation a positive external field can only _ increase _ the magnetisation in the future , turning spins up but never turning spins down is strictly positive , cf .",
    "2 . ] . consequently",
    ", the cluster of positively oriented spins generated in a system _ without _ perturbation by an external field is always a subset of the actual cluster that would have been generated if the perturbation was turned on .",
    "thus , for each site @xmath9 , where the field may have generated a spin flip , it is possible to trace and mark the cluster of all spins in the future that would have been turned up by this perturbation .",
    "the other special property of the ising model with heat bath dynamics , which is exploited by the algorithm , is the circumstance that these clusters do not interact .",
    "more specifically , if the external field had generated two spin flips , the resulting cluster would just be the union of the respective individual clusters .",
    "this allows one to tag all spins at time @xmath23 by non - interfering labels and to identify the percolation cluster for each of the labels ( see fig .  [ fig : demo ] ) .",
    "the response of a particular site @xmath93 is then proportional to the number of its labels ( re - weighted as described above ) .",
    "this trick accelerates simulations by a factor of the order @xmath112 , where @xmath112 is the total number of sites .-",
    "point correlation functions efficiently . ]",
    "the tagging algorithm can be implemented as follows .",
    "in addition to the local spin variables @xmath10 we attach to each site @xmath9 a dynamically generated set @xmath113 of labels .",
    "for example , in c++ such a dynamical set is provided by the class set < ...",
    "> s[n ] of the standard template library stl .",
    "initially all these sets are empty ( @xmath114 ) and the simulation evolves as usual . at time",
    "@xmath23 , however , each site @xmath9 is tagged by an individual label @xmath115 and the weight @xmath111 is recorded as described above",
    ". therefore , at time @xmath23 each set @xmath113 has exactly one element , namely , @xmath116 . during the subsequent simulation",
    "the spin variables @xmath10 evolve according to the usual heat bath dynamics as if there was no perturbation .",
    "however , in each update step the following additional steps are carried out    * when updating spin @xmath9 , first clear the corresponding set by setting @xmath114 and let @xmath117 be the union of all tags carried by the nearest neighbours .",
    "* for all labels @xmath118 count the number @xmath119 of nearest neighbours which are oriented in negative direction @xmath120 _ and _ carry the tag @xmath121 . obviously ,",
    "if an external field had flipped the spin corresponding to the label @xmath121 at time @xmath23 it would have increased the local field @xmath122 in the present update by @xmath123 . * if @xmath124 and @xmath125 add label @xmath121 to set @xmath113 .    the autoresponse function @xmath101 is then proportional to the weighted sum over all sets tagged by their original label , averaged over many independent realisations : @xmath126",
