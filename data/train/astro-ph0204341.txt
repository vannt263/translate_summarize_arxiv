    "the observation and theoretical modeling of weak polarization signatures in spectral lines are opening a new window on the investigation of the weak magnetism of the solar atmosphere ( see , e.g. , the recent reviews by @xcite ) . to this aim , it is important to investigate carefully within the framework of the quantum theory of polarization ( e.g. , landi deglinnocenti 1983 ) the observable effects of the atomic polarization of the energy levels involved in the line transitions of interest , including their subtle modification by the presence of magnetic fields .    in this respect , in a recent letter ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) , we reported on an interesting property of the polarizability of the levels of the d@xmath1 line of : in spite of the fact that those levels can both be aligned , atomic _ alignment _ is a condition of population imbalances between the zeeman substates of a level , such that the total populations of substates with different values of @xmath6 are different .",
    "one speaks instead of atomic _ orientation _ when , for a given value of @xmath6 , the substates labeled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 have different populations .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , or the recent review by @xcite .",
    "] when proper account is taken of the additional quantum numbers introduced by the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) of , the alignment is drastically reduced for fields larger than @xmath2 , and practically vanishes for @xmath9 , _ irrespective _ of the relative directions of the magnetic field and of the incident radiation . accordingly",
    ", any contribution to the linear polarization in the core of d@xmath1 that arises from atomic alignment is suppressed for magnetic fields sensibly larger than @xmath2 , so the only expected linear - polarization signal for such field strengths must be due to the transverse zeeman effect ( see fig .  2 of paper  i ; the reader should note how the stokes-@xmath10 signature of single - scattering events taking place in the presence of a vertical magnetic field changes from antisymmetric for @xmath11 to symmetric for @xmath12 ) .    in paper",
    "i , we were concerned mainly with a detailed calculation of the polarizability of the levels , and with the consequences it bears for our understanding of the magnetic - field distribution and topology in the solar atmosphere . in the present work ,",
    "we focus instead on the investigation of the atomic physics that is behind the polarization properties of those lines .    to this end",
    ", we follow our approach of paper  i , and apply the quantum theory of line formation in the limit of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) and in the collisionless regime , as developed by @xcite , to investigate the statistical equilibrium ( se ) of an ensemble of atoms illuminated by anisotropic radiation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis of crd corresponds to the requirement that the incident radiation field coming from the underlying photosphere , and illuminating the scattering atoms , be spectrally flat over an interval much larger than the energy separation between atomic levels whose wavefunctions sensibly overlap ( leading to the phenomenon of quantum interferences ) . in the case of the d@xmath1 and d@xmath13 lines forming in the solar atmosphere , this is a good assumption only if we neglect the quantum interferences between the upper levels of d@xmath1 and d@xmath13 .",
    "more specifically , these are interferences between the levels p@xmath0 and p@xmath5 pertaining to the same atomic term . whereas the role of these so - called _ super - interferences _ is important for a correct interpretation of line polarization in the wings of d@xmath1 and d@xmath13 , the line - core polarization of those lines , which was the subject of the investigation of paper  i , is expected to be largely unaffected by them .    in   2 , we summarize our qualitative description of the polarization properties of the levels of ( see paper  i ) , and introduce some useful new concepts and terminology . in   [ sec : polar.quant ] , we put those concepts on a more quantitative basis , and provide an algebraic proof that the alignment of the levels of d@xmath1 is suppressed when a magnetic regime of complete decoupling of the angular momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 is reached in the excited state p@xmath5 . finally , in the conclusive section , we provide further arguments to illuminate this interesting phenomenon .",
    "the stable isotope of sodium has a nuclear spin @xmath14 , therefore we must take into account the role of hfs in the solution of the se problem of .",
    "hfs was already indicated by @xcite as the only possible mechanism allowing for the existence of atomic alignment in the levels of the d@xmath1 line .",
    "in fact , levels with total angular momentum @xmath15 can not be aligned , whereas both hyperfine levels @xmath16 and @xmath17 , into which a level @xmath15 splits in the coupling process with a nuclear spin @xmath14 , can be aligned .",
    "for this reason , it is convenient to introduce the concept of _ intrinsic polarizability _ ( ip ) , for those levels whose values of @xmath18 allow the presence of atomic alignment , and of _ extrinsic polarizability _ ( ep ) , for those levels that can carry atomic alignment only through the `` internal '' @xmath19 quantum numbers , because of the presence of hfs .",
    "( what distinguishes the roles of @xmath18 and @xmath19 as quantum numbers , in this context , is the assumption we made at the beginning , that quantum interferences can exist only between different @xmath19 levels , but not between different @xmath18 levels . ) in this sense , we can speak of ep only in the cases of @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , both levels of the d@xmath1 line of are ep , whereas the upper level of d@xmath13 is ip , because @xmath21 .",
    "this nomenclature has a direct link with the physics of the interaction processes of the atom with the incident radiation field .",
    "we speak of ip of an atomic level when this level has the possibility of absorbing the multipole order @xmath22 of the polarization tensor of the incident radiation field ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , expressed in the irreducible spherical tensor representation , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "in particular , if we assume that the incident radiation field is unpolarized , and has cylindrical symmetry around the local solar vertical through the scattering centre , only the multipole orders @xmath25 ( intensity ) and @xmath22 ( anisotropy ) are present in the radiation - field tensor . in this case , it is found that an ep level can only absorb the multipole order @xmath25 , so there is no atomic polarization directly induced by the incident radiation field .",
    "any atomic alignment ( @xmath22 , in the irreducible spherical representation of the density matrix ) that such level can show  when proper account is taken of its sub - structure associated with hfs  can only come from the transfer of atomic alignment from other atomic levels that are instead ip . in the case of , for instance , if the two levels of d@xmath1 were isolated ( i.e. , not radiatively connected with other levels in the atom ) , no atomic alignment could be created , even accounting for the presence of hfs .",
    "because of the presence of the upper level p@xmath5 of d@xmath13 in the se problem of , instead , transfer of atomic polarization from such ip level to the lower level of d@xmath1 can occur , via the radiative de - excitation associated with the formation of the d@xmath13 line .",
    "once ep has been created in the level s@xmath0 , this can be transferred via absorption processes to the upper level of d@xmath1 as well . in our case ,",
    "the two levels of d@xmath1 manifest their ep because of the alignment induced onto the corresponding hfs levels , with @xmath26 ( see fig .  1 of paper  i ; also fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment ] introduced below ) .",
    "on the other hand , the transfer of atomic alignment from an ip level to an ep level can be inhibited under particular conditions .",
    "for the three - level model of the atom considered here , and for the prescribed radiation field , we determined that the atomic polarization in the two ep levels vanishes when the ip level p@xmath5 reaches the regime of the complete paschen - back effect , in which the zeeman splittings of the @xmath19 levels due to the local magnetic field become much larger than the hfs separations between those levels . in this regime ,",
    "the hfs coupling of the electronic and nuclear angular momenta , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of the atoms in the excited state p@xmath5 , is `` relaxed '' by the presence of the strong magnetic field , through the electronic zeeman effect .. ] [ to understand the meaning of such decoupling process , we must observe that , in the regime of complete paschen - back effect , and assuming the direction of @xmath27 as the quantization axis , @xmath28 becomes a conserved quantity ( rigorously , an element of the complete set of commuting observables of the atomic system ) , along with @xmath29 . because @xmath30 must be conserved as well , both @xmath31 and @xmath32 become good quantum numbers , so the eigenvectors of the atomic system take the form @xmath33 . ]    the inhibition of the transfer of atomic alignment from an ip level to an ep level for increasing magnetic strengths is clearly illustrated by the results presented in paper  i. in figure  [ fig : alignment ] , we reproduce similar results .",
    "we calculated the atomic alignment of the levels of d@xmath1 and d@xmath13 for magnetic strengths between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a vertical field ( i.e. , aligned along the symmetry axis of the radiation cone from the photosphere illuminating the scattering atom )",
    "was chosen , in order to clarify that the obtained trend of the alignment against the magnetic field strength is _ not _ due to hanle - effect depolarization . as we see , atomic alignment in the levels of d@xmath1",
    "is drastically reduced for fields larger than @xmath2 , and practically vanishes for fields of the order of @xmath36 or larger . in figure",
    "[ fig : orientation ] , we show analogous results for the atomic orientation ( @xmath37 , in the irreducible spherical representation of the density matrix ; see note  [ note : atompol ] for a description of atomic orientation ) , for magnetic strengths between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . also in this case , the orientation of the levels of the d@xmath1 line practically vanishes for @xmath9 .",
    "( we note that , for @xmath40 , the level p@xmath5 approaches the regime of complete paschen - back effect .",
    "in fact , for @xmath41 , the typical zeeman splitting is already 10 times larger than the typical hfs separation for that level . )    on the other hand , as suggested by the work of @xcite concerning optical - pumping processes in cadmium , a sufficient condition for the vanishing of atomic alignment in the ep level is that the hfs frequency separation of the ip level be negligible with respect to the einstein @xmath42-coefficient of the atomic transition .",
    "this condition is very general , as it holds regardless of the magnetic - field strength ( in particular , it is valid also for zero magnetic fields ) . in the case of , the hfs frequency separation of the ip level p@xmath5 is comparable with the einstein @xmath42-coefficient of the d@xmath13 line . for this reason ,",
    "transfer of atomic alignment from the ip upper level to the ep lower level is possible when @xmath43 , since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are still significantly coupled in the ip level p@xmath5 ( cf .",
    "also paper  i , end of  3 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the inhibition of the transfer of atomic alignment from an ip level to an ep level should be regarded as an aspect of the so - called _ principle of spectroscopic stability _ applied to the ip level : whenever the hyperfine structure of the ip level becomes negligible , whether because a magnetic field is present which is strong enough to reach the complete paschen - back regime for that level , or because the hfs separation of that level is much smaller than its radiative width , the transfer of alignment from the ip level to the ep level is inhibited , so the ep level behaves as if the atomic hfs were not present at all .",
    "the reason for this is hidden in the complexity of the se problem , and it is addressed in the following section .",
    "we consider an ip level with total electronic angular momentum @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that this level can only interact with ep levels in the atom . beyond this restriction",
    ", the atomic system can be arbitrary , so the following formalism applies also for atoms other than . if a nuclear spin is present , of angular momentum @xmath44 , the density matrix for the ip level in the irreducible spherical tensor representation is ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : ket ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoff ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cg ] ) , gives @xmath51 we now make the assumption that the electronic spin and the nuclear spin are decoupled ( or very weakly coupled ) when the atom is in the ip level . as anticipated in the previous section , this can be the case if the hfs separation is much smaller than the natural width of that level , or , in the presence of a magnetic field , if the level is in the regime of complete paschen - back effect . in either case",
    ", the atomic density matrix for the ip level can be factorized as @xmath52 we introduce at this point the formalism of the irreducible spherical tensors for both @xmath53 and @xmath54 ,    @xmath55    substitution of eq .",

    "( [ eq : rhoff.1 ] ) , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhoj ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoi ] ) , gives @xmath56 finally , this equation must be substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhokq ] ) .",
    "we then obtain an expression which involves the contraction over all magnetic quantum numbers of a product of five @xmath49 symbols .",
    "this contraction can be evaluated using , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 14 ) , p.  456",
    ", of @xcite , yielding the expression @xmath57 as a particular case , if nuclear polarization is absent ( @xmath58 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhokq.ji ] ) reduces to @xmath59 in this case , the ( electronic ) atomic polarization of the @xmath18 level translates _ directly _",
    "( i.e. , with the same @xmath60 and @xmath10 ) into the atomic polarization of the @xmath61 pair .      as an application of the former development , we consider a two - level atom @xmath62 endowed with hfs",
    ". neglecting stimulated emission for simplicity , the se equations for the two levels read ( @xcite ) @xmath63 and @xmath64 to understand how atomic polarization is created in an ep level , assuming that the other level is ip , we must consider explicitly the expressions of the transfer rates for absorption and spontaneous emission processes , respectively , @xmath65 and @xmath66 the relaxation rate due to spontaneous emission , @xmath67 , is completely diagonal , so it can only relate each of the elements @xmath68 to itself .",
    "the relaxation rate due to absorption , @xmath69 , is a necessary ingredient of this demonstration .",
    "however , the only fact we will rely upon is the presence in that rate of the @xmath70 symbol @xmath71 the rate @xmath72 , in both eqs .",
    "( [ eq : seu ] ) and ( [ eq : sel ] ) , describes magnetic and hfs depolarization .",
    "the importance of this rate is that it accounts for the conversion mechanism of atomic alignment ( @xmath22 ) into atomic orientation ( @xmath37 ) discussed by @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that , in the algebraic expression of the rate ( not given here ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( cf .",
    "[ [ eq : seu ] ] ) or @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "[ [ eq : sel ] ] ) can have different parity .",
    "if the radiation illuminating the atom is not circularly polarized ( which is the case of the present discussion ) , this conversion mechanism is the only process capable of creating orientation in the atomic system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this mechanism is only effective when quantum interferences between different @xmath19 levels are important , which corresponds to a regime of magnetic fields such that level crossing between @xmath19 levels can occur .",
    "therefore , for magnetic fields such that the upper level approaches the regime of complete paschen - back effect ( @xmath40 ) , the conversion of atomic alignment into atomic orientation is drastically reduced ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : orientation ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "the role of the rate @xmath72 is not of immediate concern for the following arguments .",
    "we first consider the case in which @xmath77 is the ip level .",
    "when this level is in a regime of very weak coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( whether because the hfs separation is much smaller than @xmath78 , or because a magnetic field is present that is strong enough to establish a regime of complete paschen - back effect in that level ) , the irreducible components of the density matrix for that level , @xmath79 , can be written according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhokq.ji ] ) .",
    "it is then found that the double summation over @xmath80 and @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sel ] ) can be performed algebraically .",

    "( [ eq : seu ] ) and ( [ eq : ta ] ) we see that the prescribed radiation field ( @xmath94 ) can only induce atomic alignment in the upper level ( besides populating it ) , because of the selection rule introduced by the @xmath49 symbol in eq .",

    "since the atom was initially unpolarized , and by assumption the electronic and nuclear systems are decoupled in the excited state , @xmath77 , the atomic alignment of the upper level can only be electronic .",
    "in fact , electric - dipole transitions can not affect the nuclear system , so the nuclear zeeman sublevels remain naturally populated in all cases of interest , even if strong @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling is present in the ep level . from this argument",

    "this is in agreement with the results of paper  i , and of figures  1 and 2 in this paper .    in summary , when the ip upper level is in a regime of very weak @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling , the creation of atomic alignment in the ep lower level ( @xmath88 ) by transfer of atomic alignment from the ip upper level ( @xmath98 ) is inhibited . in the case of",

    ", lower - level orientation can only be created by the transfer of atomic orientation from the upper level ( @xmath97 ) , which is not inhibited in principle . on the other hand ,",
    "the alignment - to - orientation conversion mechanism in the upper level becomes very inefficient for very weak @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation ] ) , so also upper - level orientation can only be created if the incident radiation field is circularly polarized .",
    "we checked our conclusion that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhokq.ji.0 ] ) must apply to the ip upper level , in the regime of very weak @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling , against the numerical results of paper  i ( cf .  also fig .",

    "in particular , we verified that the ratio of the quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the upper level @xmath105 of ( @xmath14 ) in the strong - field limit ( @xmath106 ; see rightmost panels of fig .  1 in paper  i ; also fig .  [",

    "this equation also accounts for the curious vanishing of the quantity @xmath107 in the same limit , which is due to the fact that @xmath108 vanishes identically because of the ( non - trivial ) nullity of the @xmath70 symbol in eq .",

    "this shows , in particular , that the concept of ep is also valid for an upper level . in this case , the ep upper level is sensitive to the anisotropy of radiation ( @xmath121 ) through the transfer rate @xmath112 , but nonetheless creation of alignment in the upper level through the absorption of that anisotropy is not possible when the ip lower level is in a regime of very weak @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling , because of the selection rules implied by the sum ( [ eq : contr2 ] ) . upper - level orientation ( @xmath122 ) is not excluded in principle , if @xmath123 , although it can only be created by transfer of atomic orientation from the lower level ( @xmath124 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : contr2 ] ] ) .",
    "however , when the lower level is in the regime of weak @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling , its orientation can only be due to the presence of circular polarization in the incident radiation field .",
    "in this paper we demonstrated analytically that the presence of @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling in the ip level p@xmath5 of is a necessary condition for the transfer of atomic alignment from that level to the ep ground level s@xmath0 .",
    "we based our demonstration on the quantum theory of line formation , as developed by @xcite , and assuming unpolarized incident radiation without spectral structure over the frequency intervals encompassing the hfs components of the atomic transitions of interest . under these conditions ,",
    "we relied on the argument that nuclear polarization can not be created in an atom having only one ip level , if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are completely decoupled in that level , because the assumed incident radiation can not induce directly nuclear transitions in the atom .",
    "it follows , from the results of  3 , that atomic polarization can not be created in the ep levels , when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are completely decoupled in the ip level .",
    "we can further strengthen this argument by showing that the possibility of nuclear polarization actually resides in the presence of @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling in the ip level , whereas the presence of @xmath18-@xmath44 coupling in the ep level is not relevant . to this purpose",

    ", it seems safe to conclude that , even in the real case , nuclear polarization can not be created in the atom , when the regime of complete paschen - back effect is reached in the ( only ) ip level .",
    "finally , we must emphasize that the presence of atomic alignment in the upper level of the d@xmath1 line induces a characteristic _ antisymmetric _ signature in the core of the stokes-@xmath10 profile resulting from the scattering of the anisotropic radiation illuminating the atom ( see fig .  2 of paper i ) .",
    "this applies particularly to the optically thin `` prominence case '' considered in paper  i , where the scattering polarization is solely due to the emission events following atomic excitation by the anisotropic radiation .",
    "currently we are investigating to what extent such antisymmetric signature can be modified through dichroism and radiative transfer effects , because of the presence of atomic alignment in the ground level of ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; for the observable effects of dichroism and ground - level polarization on the 10830   multiplet , see @xcite ) .    in this respect , it is interesting to note that spectropolarimetric observations of the d - lines obtained with thmis in quiet regions close to the solar limb show an antisymmetric signature in the fractional linear polarization @xmath125 of the d@xmath1 line ( see fig .  1 of @xcite , which was adapted from @xcite ;",

    ". there seems to be an indication of a similar antisymmetric signature in the @xmath125 atlas of @xcite , which was obtained with the polarimeter zimpol - ii attached to the gregory coud telescope ( gct ) of irsol at locarno ( italy ) . on the contrary , analogous observations that @xcite had obtained previously with the polarimeter zimpol - i attached to the mcmath - pierce facility of the national solar observatory show almost symmetric profiles with a central positive peak ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "observations of quiet solar regions were obtained in march 1998 ( i.e. , two years earlier than the above mentioned thmis observations ) , when the sun had not yet reached the maximum of its magnetic activity cycle . ]",

    "nevertheless , we think that the above mentioned linear - polarization observations of the d@xmath1 line in very quiet regions of the solar disk , with thmis and zimpol , both have the same physical origin , i.e. , atomic alignment in the levels of the d@xmath1 line . now that we understand how the ground level of becomes polarized , and how its polarization is modified by the presence of weak magnetic fields",

    "<S> in a recent letter ( @xcite ) , we showed the remarkable result that the atomic alignment of the levels p@xmath0 and s@xmath0 of the d@xmath1 line of is practically destroyed in the presence of magnetic fields sensibly larger than @xmath2 , irrespectively of the field direction . in this paper , we demonstrate analytically that this property is a consequence of the decoupling of the electronic and nuclear angular momenta , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in the excited state p@xmath5 , which is achieved when the zeeman splitting from the local magnetic field becomes much larger than the typical hyperfine separation for that level . </S>"
