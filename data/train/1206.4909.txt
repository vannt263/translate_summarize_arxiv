    "the dynamics and thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks is a subject that goes back at least to @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen considerable interest in the problem at different levels , from the characterization of their mass - action kinetics @xcite and of their stochastic thermodynamics based on the chemical master equation @xcite , to the analysis of their non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) @xcite . besides their relevance for fundamental understanding",
    ", these approaches provide an important frame for the study of real biochemical systems , like genome - scale reconstructions of cellular metabolic networks @xcite . the most basic information about these systems is usually encoded in the matrix of stoichiometric coefficients , representing in essence the ( weighted ) topology of the couplings between chemical species and reactions . with uncertainties about kinetic parameters and",
    "reaction or transport mechanisms often preventing large - scale kinetic approaches ( with exceptions like the the metabolism of human erythrocytes @xcite ) , the challenge at the simplest level is that of building stoichiometry - based predictive models of metabolic activity at genome scale .",
    "much information on the organization of reaction fluxes in ness can indeed be obtained from constraint - based models that rely on minimal mass - balance @xcite or stability @xcite assumptions .",
    "such descriptions revolve around pre - defined ( and physically motivated ) sets of local constraints , enforcing for instance mass balance at each metabolite node in the network .",
    "it would be interesting ( and instructive ) to _ derive _ the relevant local constraints as the result of a mathematical analysis of the dynamics taking place on the network , both to further clarify the assumptions behind the models and to highlight their limitations .",
    "this work revisits the joint dynamics of concentrations and reaction fluxes in chemical networks in a statistical mechanics frame . in specific ,",
    "we obtain a variational principle that relates fluxes ( i.e. the average number of microscopic transitions per time per volume for each process ) in ness to the minima of a global function where stoichiometric coefficients and steady - state concentrations appear as parameters .",
    "this function is reminiscent of the hamiltonian of a hopfield model with hebbian couplings @xcite , with stoichiometry playing the role of the patterns .",
    "an analysis of its physical meaning explicitly shows that reaction networks dynamically converge towards states where the use of the available compounds is optimized and the rate of decay of entropy production is minimized .",
    "the flux organization problem turns out to have remarkable similarities with that of optimal resource allocation by heterogeneous agents , as described e.g. by minority games @xcite .",
    "systems of this type generically undergo a transition from an ergodic phase ( the ness is independent of the initial conditions of the dynamics ) to a non - ergodic one when the ratio between the number of reactions and that of chemical species is changed . in our case , the two regimes are described by different sets of local constraints .",
    "we shall first explore this scenario in toy `` random '' reaction networks where such a transition can be fully analyzed numerically .",
    "then a simple real system will be considered , namely the reduced metabolic network model of human erythrocytes .",
    "finally , we shall discuss the relevance of these results for the quantitative analysis of cellular metabolism .",
    "we consider an open system enclosed in a volume @xmath0 ( a reactor or `` cell '' , for brevity ) , formed by @xmath1 distinct chemical species ( labelled @xmath2 ) that can be processed by @xmath3 distinct reactions ( labelled @xmath4 ) at fixed temperature @xmath5 , pressure , ionic strength and ph .",
    "the reaction stoichiometry is described by the coefficients @xmath6 , with the convention that negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) coefficients identify substrates ( resp .",
    "products ) in the ` forward ' direction of reaction @xmath7 .",
    "individual reaction events occur stochastically with rates ( number of events per unit time ) proportional to the substrate concentrations , which vary in time . at stationarity and for ideal systems ,",

    "specifically , the forward ( @xmath13 ) and reverse ( @xmath14 ) fluxes of @xmath7 , i.e. the average number of transitions per time per volume , satisfies the relation @xmath15 with @xmath16 @xcite . at equilibrium , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for each @xmath7 .",
    "we focus on the time evolution of the internal composition of such a chemical reactor .",
    "the dynamics of this system is driven essentially by two factors : ( a ) the fact that molecules can stochastically enter or leave the system , and ( b ) the fact that reactions events occur ( stochastically ) inside the system .",
    "reasonably , then , the ness will depend ( a ) on the rate at which molecules can cross the system s boundaries per unit volume ( intake or outtake fluxes , denoted by @xmath19 ) , and ( b ) on the rates of the internal reactions ( more precisely , on the average net number of microscopic transitions per time per volume , denoted by @xmath20 ) . in the following",
    "we will show specifically that , given the boundary fluxes @xmath19 ( characterizing the environment ) , over time scales for which the chemical potentials can be assumed to vary slowly ( so that concentrations can be assumed to be roughly constant ) the internal fluxes in a ness minimize the function @xmath21 ^ 2\\geq 0~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the concentration of species @xmath2 .",

    "molecular populations are large enough to allow us to treat @xmath10 as a continuous variable .",

    "the quantity @xmath42 is small ( i.e. the chemical potential @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the standard chemical potential , is roughly constant ) , so that @xmath45 can also be taken to be small .    under the above assumptions the right - hand side of ( [ yy ] ) is easily linearized to yield @xmath46\\nu_j(t)+\\frac{1}{v}\\sum_{\\mu}\\frac{\\xi_i^\\mu b^\\mu(t)}{x^\\mu(t)}~~.\\ ] ] this equation highlights the way in which concentrations affect the time evolution of the system and , in principle",

    "this gives @xmath52 note that @xmath53 is the net flux of reaction @xmath7 ( the average net number of microscopic transitions per time per volume ) while @xmath54 represents the uptake of species @xmath2 ( the average number of molecules of species @xmath2 per time per volume entering or leaving the cell ) . defining @xmath55 we therefore have @xmath56 with @xmath57 ^ 2\\geq 0~~.\\ ] ] this implies that , on average , the stochastic dynamics of reactions collectively minimizes the function @xmath58 so that the ness of ( [ lang ] ) correspond to the solutions of the minimization problem @xmath59 constrained by the uptake values and by the fact that the @xmath20 s are assumed to be bounded by enzyme availability , so that @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "following @xcite , we can characterize the behavior of fluxes in ness by noting that the solutions of ( [ lang ] ) for @xmath61 ( which are expected to be linked to the gibbs energy change of reaction @xmath7 in a ness ) are generically of the form @xmath62 with @xmath63 , since @xmath64 is constant in ness . in practice",
    ", the stochastic dynamics of @xmath41 for different reactions will be characterized by different values of @xmath64 , depending on the asymptotic behavior . if @xmath41 tends to a finite value as @xmath61 then @xmath65 . recalling that the gibbs energy change is related to the forward - to - reverse flux ratio through the detailed balance condition , this describes the case of a reaction whose microscopic transitions occur bidirectionally even for @xmath61 , i.e. such that the forward and reverse fluxes are both non - zero in the steady state .",
    "specifically , its flux is determined by the condition @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 , instead , @xmath41 increases or decreases linearly in time ( after a transient ) and diverges for @xmath61 so that , in the corresponding ness , reaction @xmath7 will be characterized by unidirectional microscopic transitions for @xmath61 .",
    "note that if @xmath65 then @xmath58 is indeed minimized by solving @xmath68 , whereas for @xmath67 the minimum of @xmath58 is achieved by taking @xmath20 as large ( if @xmath69 ) or as small ( if @xmath70 ) as possible , i.e. @xmath71 ( resp .",
    "@xmath72 ) if @xmath69 ( resp .",
    "@xmath70 ) .      for a start ,",
    "notice that the change in @xmath41 is expressed in equation ( [ ydot2 ] ) as the sum of two terms .",
    "the first accounts for the coupling of @xmath7 to other reactions in the network via shared compounds ( the coupling coefficient @xmath50 is non - zero only if @xmath7 and @xmath73 have a metabolite with finite concentration in common ) . consider a species @xmath2 and two reactions @xmath7 and @xmath73 such that @xmath74 ( @xmath73 produces @xmath2 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath2 is consumed by @xmath7 )",
    ". then @xmath76 and a positive net advancement of reaction @xmath73 will contribute to the increase of @xmath41 , see ( [ ydot2 ] ) .",
    "now looking at ( [ yy ] ) it is reasonable to expect that the probability of observing a forward transition for reaction @xmath7 between time @xmath27 and time @xmath28 will be larger the larger ( and positive ) is @xmath77 ( in agreement with the fluctuation theorem @xcite ; we shall see an explicit example of this later on ) .",
    "therefore in this case a positive net advancement of reaction @xmath73 will ultimately increase the probability of a concomitant advancement of reaction @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , this situation favors the emergence of a positive correlation between reactions @xmath7 and @xmath73 .",
    "likewise , if both @xmath7 and @xmath73 are either producing ( @xmath78 , @xmath74 ) or consuming ( @xmath75 , @xmath79 ) species @xmath2 , their coupling will tend to anti - correlate @xmath39 and @xmath80 .",
    "in this case the dynamics discourages over - production or over - consumption of a chemical species .",
    "a similar picture holds for the coefficients @xmath81 , which are related to the presence of sources ( like nutrients ) and sinks ( e.g. outtakes ) in the network",
    ". a non - zero @xmath81 acts as a force of magnitude proportional to @xmath82 that tends to polarize in a particular direction a reaction @xmath7 that is stoichiometrically connected to a compound @xmath2 with @xmath83 .",
    "the favoured direction depends on whether @xmath2 is a source or a sink and on the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "this effect can propagate to other nodes connected to @xmath7 if @xmath82 is sufficiently large .",
    "the role of the concentrations @xmath22 appearing in @xmath50 and @xmath81 is in essence that of modulating the strength of the couplings and of the forcing fields with the availability of the intermediate metabolites .",
    "indeed , @xmath50 s get stronger when the intermediate compounds are present in smaller amounts , stressing the emergence of positive correlations between processes ( if @xmath76 ) or the limits imposed by competition for a limited resource ( if @xmath84 )",
    ". when the concentration of the intermediate is large , instead , the coupling gets weaker and @xmath7 and @xmath73 may become effectively independent .",
    "the impact of @xmath81 is understood along similar lines . in this way , the original bipartite network of reactions and metabolites can be re - cast as a system of interacting reactions with hebbian couplings , as shown in fig .",

    "grey arrows are double - headed when the sign of @xmath91 depends on the precise values of stoichiometric coefficients and uptake fluxes .",

    "in such a scenario , finding the steady state(s ) of ( [ ydot ] ) is equivalent to finding the ground states of a system of reactions interacting with `` energy '' @xmath58 .    from a physical standpoint",
    ", @xmath58 quantifies the resource mis - usage by the network so that , by minimizing @xmath58 , the system strives to reach states in which compounds are used as optimally as possible , given the initial conditions @xmath95 ( that also account for the standard ges and hence , to some degree , for the _ a priori _ reversibility ) , the stoichiometry , the available nutrients , the production goals , etc . whether for a _ given network _ the minimum of @xmath58 is zero or",
    "not then depends on several factors , including the bounds on fluxes and the specific form of the uptakes .",
    "note that @xmath96 would imply that at stationarity @xmath97 i.e. that in the steady state a kirchhoff - law type of scenario holds in which strict mass - balance conditions are satisfied for each chemical species .",
    "the network in this case organizes the fluxes so that consumption and production exactly match for each species and meet the nutrient availability and outtake requirements described by the vector @xmath98 . on the other hand ,",
    "the physically relevant states with @xmath99 can more generally be thought to have @xmath100 otherwise the system could e.g. consume a nutrient in excess of its availability . both sets of conditions have been employed for the modeling of cellular metabolic networks . in particular equations of the type of ( [ mb ] )",
    "are the basis of the highly successful flux - balance - analysis ( fba ) @xcite , where biological functionality is included as an additional _ ad hoc _ constraint usually represented by the maximization of a specific score function ( e.g. biomass production for _ e. coli _ in an optimal environment ) .",
    "the conditions ( [ vn ] ) are instead reminiscent of von neumann s model of reaction networks @xcite , where self - consistent flux states with a net positive production of intracellular metabolites can be allowed",
    ". this type of approach can be helpful in analyzing the metabolic capabilities of an organism and , if statistically robust production profiles emerge , in inferring ( rather than postulating ) cellular objective functions , with the idea that chemical species that are globally produced ( e.g. amino acids ) are employed in macromolecular processes ( like protein formation ) that are not encoded by the reaction stoichiometry .",
    "we remark however that within the above setting finding the ness of the system means minimizing @xmath58 , which obviously is a priori different from solving ( [ mb ] ) or ( [ vn ] ) .",
    "a broader physical insight can be obtained by studying how @xmath58 relates to standard quantities used to characterize non - equilibrium behavior in reaction networks , such as the entropy production .",
    "indeed the entropy production per volume @xmath101 of the system enclosed in the `` cell '' of volume @xmath0 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath10 is the concentration of species @xmath2 and @xmath43 is its chemical potential .",
    "taking time derivatives keeping in mind that at stationarity @xmath103 is constant , one easily finds that @xmath104 .",
    "now since @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , @xmath58 is constant in ness .",
    "it follows that for time scales shorter than @xmath107 ( i.e. for time scales over which chemical potentials are roughly constant ) one has @xmath108 @xmath58 is thus seen to play the role of the rate at which the entropy production changes in a ness . if @xmath96 ( i.e. if the ness is flux - balanced ) , then @xmath101 must vanish as well ( since @xmath109 ) , leading to a state with constant entropy .",
    "if @xmath110 , instead , the entropy production is non - zero and decreases at the smallest allowed rate . correspondingly , the entropy `` slows down '' quadratically over the time scales for which the theory holds .",
    "( note that for sufficiently long times the entropy production can become negative if @xmath111 , implying that this limit may be unphysical . ) in summary , the ness that can be obtained are either characterized by @xmath112 , zero entropy production and hence constant entropy , or by @xmath111 , positive entropy production decreasing in time as slowly as possible and entropy increasing in time accordingly .",
    "it is noteworthy that this scenario essentially characterizes the lyapunov condition described in @xcite for the stability of stationary states ( chapter 18 ) .",
    "the lyapunov function in our case can be computed explicitly , takes the form ( [ h ] ) , its minimization bears a further physical meaning in terms of optimal resource allocation , and provides an equivalent description of the reactor as a system of processes interacting via hebbian couplings .",
    "indeed the quantity @xmath58 appears in the gibbs theory of thermodynamic stability for ideal systems .",
    "let us consider a system at equilibrium with vanishing net fluxes and evaluate the effect of a perturbation that drives the system away from equilibrium .",
    "such a perturbation corresponds to a ( small ) change in the turnover @xmath113 of each reaction @xmath7 , which can be achieved e.g. by forcing a ( small ) non - zero flux @xmath20 through each reaction @xmath7 for a time @xmath25 , so that @xmath114 .",
    "the free energy per volume associated to the perturbed state is easily found to be given by @xmath115 in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics . after turning off the perturbation",
    ", the system will relax back to equilibrium by minimizing @xmath116 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) .",
    "a simple algebraic argument allows to understand that , generically , a qualitative change in the solutions of ( [ min ] ) is expected to take place as one varies the ratio between the network parameters @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath117 denote the number of reactions that remain asymptotically bidirectional , i.e. such that @xmath65 .",
    "the conditions @xmath118 that they must satisfy form a set of @xmath117 equations , @xmath1 of which at most are independent ( strictly speaking , the rank of the matrix @xmath119 equals that of the stoichiometric matrix @xmath120 , see ( [ jay ] ) ; it is however always possible to eliminate dependencies in the latter so as to attain full rows rank ) .",
    "neglecting the fact that variables are bounded , we can say that when the number of variables ( @xmath117 ) exceeds that of equations the system is underconstrained and multiple solutions occur .",
    "so multiple steady states exist when @xmath121 .",
    "note that @xmath117 is determined _ dynamically _ by ( [ ydot ] ) with initial conditions @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests that different choices of @xmath95 will lead to different steady states , i.e. that when @xmath121 ergodicity ( i.e. independence of the steady state on initial conditions ) wo nt hold .",
    "a transition is thus expected to occur when @xmath122 .    such a transition can be fully investigated within the following , simple model : the stoichiometric coefficients @xmath120 are independent , identically distributed random numbers ( such that each reaction uses and produces a finite fraction of the possible compounds ) , and the dynamics of the network advances in discrete time steps of size @xmath25 . in specific , at each time @xmath27 the @xmath39 s take on values stochastically in @xmath123 with @xmath124 i.e. with @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "note that the above probability ratio is proportional to the ratio between the concentration of substrates and that of products of the reaction .",
    "clearly , ( [ db ] ) does not allow to capture the temporal structure induced by the arrhenius law , because by forcing each reaction to take place at every time step it neglects the fact that activation energies ( and hence characteristic timescales ) can differ significantly across reactions .",
    "it is however reasonable to think that the steady state will be unaffected by these transients . on the other hand ( [ db ] )",
    "makes the theory considerably easier from a mathematical viewpoint and the final result for the steady state ( which is the focus of the present work ) more transparent . setting @xmath126 for simplicity , so that @xmath127 for each @xmath7 , one can follow @xcite to derive the continuous - time limit of ( [ ydot ] ) for large @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "the result is the langevin process @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a gaussian noise with zero mean .",

    "recalling that @xmath15 and noting that this implies @xmath131 where , by ( [ db ] ) , @xmath132 , this in turn suggests the relation @xmath133 which explicitly links the thermodynamic driving force of a reaction to the ( stochastic ) dynamics of the quantity @xmath41 .",
    "the fact that the final result differs from the nave intuition @xmath134 is a direct consequence of the stochastic fluctuations encoded in ( [ db ] ) .",

    "we want to use the theory described here to estimate the range of variability of the fraction of glucose consumed by each pathway as a function of the oxygen concentration in the environment .",
    "we start by assuming ( reasonably ) that the steady state of the hrbc metabolism is compatible with @xmath96 ( i.e. flux balance ) .",
    "a straightforward analysis of the emerging equations reveal that only three of the 23 reactions are linearly independent : we choose the glucose uptake @xmath185 , the flux through the rapoport - leubering shunt ( or through the enzyme 2,3-dpg mutase , dpgm , a key step that regulates the haemoglobin s affinity with oxygen ) @xmath186 and the flux through the pentose phosphate pathway ( or through the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , g6pdh ) @xmath187 .",
    "all fluxes can be written in terms of these .",
    "in particular , one finds @xmath188 now the variation of the _ extracellular _ concentrations of glc , lac , k@xmath183 , na@xmath183 and co@xmath184 due to the operation of a single hrbc is easily seen to be given by @xmath189 in turn , for the extracellular medium one has @xmath190 minimizing this at fixed @xmath185 and @xmath191 one finds that @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are defined respectively as @xmath195 one sees that if the concentration of co@xmath184 is much larger than the others ( implying @xmath196 ) and @xmath197 then @xmath198 so that the pentose phosphate pathway consumes roughly all of the glucose ( the factor 6 is in agreement with the stoichiometry of carbon atoms in glc and co@xmath184 ) .",
    "we can therefore define the fraction of glc consumption through the ppp by re - scaling @xmath199 by @xmath200 : @xmath201 from this it is also immediately clear that , in general conditions for co@xmath184 , @xmath202 varies between @xmath203 ( corresponding to @xmath197 ) and @xmath204 ( corresponding to maximal @xmath205 ) . using the typical concentration values for the above metabolites in the blood , namely @xmath206 m , @xmath207 m",
    ", @xmath208 m and @xmath209 m one has @xmath210 and @xmath211 so that @xmath212 . despite the roughness of the network reconstruction we employed , the bounds just obtained are in remarkable agreement with experimental evidence . on the other hand , using the empirical estimates",
    "@xmath213 m/s and @xmath214 m/s we find @xmath215 .",
    "in this paper we have derived a variational principle for the ness of chemical reaction networks , showing that , for time scales over which chemical potentials can be considered constant , stationary non - equilibrium fluxes minimize the function @xmath58 , see ( [ h ] ) , in which stoichiometry , intakes , outtakes and concentrations appear as parameters . the cost function is closely related to hopfield models of neural networks .",
    "this allows to rephrase such networks as systems of reactions interacting via hebb - like rules and subject to an external forcing provided by the boundary fluxes .",
    "furthermore @xmath58 bears two simple physical interpretations . first , minimizing it amounts to finding the flux organizations that keep the overall `` waste '' of chemical species to a minimum , given the boundary conditions to be satisfied .",
    "second , it equals ( modulo a constant ) the time derivative of the entropy production per volume : ness thus correspond to flux configurations such that the entropy production decreases in time at the smallest allowed rate , in line with the ideas exposed in @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the implications of such a picture in toy ( random ) chemical networks  where the dependence of the solutions on the network s structural parameters can be fully explored , revealing the existence of a phase transition between flux balanced states with @xmath96 and states where unbalances emerge  and in a small real biochemical network , namely the metabolic network of the human red blood cell , a system that is possibly the closest to the theoretical situation described here .    making contact with stoichiometric models of metabolic networks is relatively straightforward as long as boundary fluxes are taken to be fixed and one does not include additional objective functions that ness are required to maximize .",
    "for instance , the maximization of biomass flux ( a frequent optimization criterion for bacterial metabolism @xcite ) provides a source of entropy production even if one focuses on states with @xmath112 ( as in flux - balance - analysis , fba ) . on the other hand",
    "the theory developed here suggests that the set of local constraints that describes ness is provided by the minimization of @xmath58 rather than by taking @xmath112 or @xmath105 a priori .",
    "an important property that ness should possess is thermodynamic feasibility , i.e. they should not contain infeasible loops @xcite . inspired by the fluctuation theorem @xcite , we have proposed here a simple dynamical rule ( see ( [ db ] ) ) that ensures that the ness obtained as the minima of h are indeed void of cycles . in general",
    "( i.e. when straightforward minimization of @xmath58 is carried out ) , it is possible to get rid of infeasible cycles by complementing the variational problem described here with the minimization of the square norm of the flux vector .",
    "this is a consequence of the gordan theorem of alternatives @xcite : assuming that the matrix @xmath216 has full rank , only one of the following systems has a non - trivial solution : ( a ) @xmath217 ( for @xmath218 real ) ; ( b ) @xmath219 ( for @xmath220 ) . for a reaction network with stoichiometric coefficients @xmath6 and",
    "fluxes @xmath20 , defining @xmath221 one sees that system ( a ) expresses the condition of thermodynamic stability @xmath222 , whereas system ( b ) defines thermodynamically infeasible cycles , so that either a flux configuration @xmath223 is thermodynamically feasible or it contains at least one cycle . now let us consider a steady - state flux configuration satisfying @xmath224 and let us assume it is thermodynamically infeasible , i.e. that system ( b ) has a solution @xmath225 . we can then construct a new flux configuration @xmath226 as @xmath227 , with @xmath228 a constant . evidently , still @xmath229 . however defining @xmath230 ,",
    "it is easily seen that choosing @xmath228 so that @xmath231 one gets @xmath232 . in other terms , starting from a thermodynamically infeasible steady - state flux configuration one can construct another steady - state flux configuration whose total flux is lower . in turn , @xmath233 has to be minimum when the flux configuration is thermodynamically feasible",
    ". it would be interesting to find a dynamical justification of this criterion .",
    "( notice that flux minimization is an optimality principle frequently used for metabolic network modeling , see e.g. @xcite . )    perhaps not too surprisingly , the formal aspects of this theory present many common traits with those developed over the past decade for the analysis of large games with heterogeneous interacting agents , specifically with minority games @xcite . for obvious reasons ,",
    "such an analogy should nt be stretched and we do not elaborate in detail on it here .",
    "in short , however , reactions ( or , more properly , enzymes ) in chemical networks can be thought to be involved in a competition for the use of a set of possibly limited resources ( the different substrates ) . whether a reaction can operate or not depends on how much substrate is available to it , i.e. on the overall substrate concentration and on how many other enzymes can bind the same substrates .",
    "each reaction disposes of two ` strategies ' ( or ways to access the set of resources ) , corresponding to the vectors of its input and output metabolites in the forward and reverse direction , respectively .",
    "such strategies are anti - correlated : substrates in the forward direction are products in the reverse , and vice - versa",
    ". rules like ( [ dynam ] ) can then be read as ` learning ' processes through which enzymes try to anticipate at each time step whether the substrates needed for the forward or reverse processes are most likely to be available , in order for it to operate .",
    "this parallel provides an elementary quantitative flavor to the idea that enzymes in biochemical reaction networks compete for the substrates . in absence of boundary fluxes ( @xmath234 for each @xmath7 in ( [ ydot ] ) ) , the situation is completely equivalent to the minority game with anti - correlated strategies studied in @xcite . in this case",
    ", the dynamics converges to @xmath112 and @xmath181 for each @xmath7 , i.e. the system asymptotically reaches chemical equilibrium . as it should be , ness are induced by non - zero boundary fluxes , i.e. by non - zero fields @xmath81 .",
    "this additional term turns out to be the main difference between standard anti - correlated minority games and the systems discussed here .",
    "besides a possible theoretical interest in deepening the analogy just described ( e.g. by extending the dynamical approaches employed for the analysis of multi - agent systems @xcite to models of chemical reaction networks ) , it will be interesting to see how well the variational principle ( [ min ] ) describes flux states in real biochemical networks .",
