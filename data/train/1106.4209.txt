    "was a single x - ray counterpart detected inside the @xmath11.4 arcminutes ibis / isgri error circle , suggesting a transient nature .",
    "this x - ray source was also detected by chandra on february 2009 ( tomsick et al .",
    "2009 ) at a flux level of @xmath1 1.3@xmath310@xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 , i.e. similar to that also measured by _ swift_/xrt .",
    "the chandra 0.210 kev spectrum was rather hard ( @xmath7 @xmath1 0.5 ) and intrinsically absorbed ( n@xmath8 @xmath1 7@xmath310@xmath9 @xmath5 ) , supporting a hmxb nature for igr j17354@xmath03255 .",
    "it is worth noting that only one bright 2mass counterpart is located inside the refined chandra error circle ( 0.2 arcseconds radius ) while there are no catalogued usno optical objects ( tomsick et al .",
    "the high inferred optical extinction and the relatively high x - ray column density suggest that the source is probably distant and located at least at the distance of the galactic center region ( @xmath18.5 kpc ) .",
    "finally , the position of igr j17354@xmath03255 is spatially correlated with that of agl j1734@xmath03310 , an unidentified transient mev source discovered by agile on april 2009 during a flare lasting only one day ( bulgarelli et al .",
    "although the hypothesis of a physical link between the two objects is intriguing , the large positional uncertainty of agl j1734@xmath03310 ( error radius of 0@xmath10.65 ) makes this association rather circumstantial and further in - depth studies are needed .",
    "here we report for the first time on detailed spectral and timing analysis of integral data of igr j17354@xmath03255 .",
    "in particular , the integral long - term monitoring allowed us to discover 15 new hard x - ray flares and properly study the out - of - outburst x - ray emission .",
    "our findings are crucial to understand the nature of the source and the origin of its x - ray emission",
    ". finally we used all the collected informations to investigate the possibility of a physical association between igr j17354@xmath03255 and agl j1734@xmath03310 and we discuss any possible major implication stemming from this association .",
    "for the integral study , we used all the public data collected with ibis / isgri ( ubertini et al .",
    "2003 , lebrun et al . 2003 ) and jem - x ( lund et al . 2003 ) from the end of february 2003 to the end of october 2008 .",
    "in particular , the ibis ( jem - x ) data set consists of @xmath1 7050 ( @xmath1 602 ) pointings or science windows ( scws , @xmath1 2000 seconds duration ) where igr j17354@xmath03255 was within 12@xmath10 ( 5@xmath10 ) from the centre of the instruments fov . a 12@xmath10 limit",
    "was applied because the off - axis response of ibis / isgri is not well modelled at large off - axis angles and in combination with the telescope dithering ( or the movement of the source within the fov ) it may introduce a systematic error in the measurement of the source fluxes .",
    "ibis / isgri images for each pointing were generated in the energy band 1860 kev using the isdc offline scientific analysis software version 7.0 .",
    "count rates at the position of the source were extracted from all individual images to produce its long term light curve on the scw timescale .",
    "in addition , we also used data collected with the bat and xrt instruments on board the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) . from the _",
    "swift_/xrt archive , igr j17354@xmath03255 was observed on march 2008 and april 2009 .",

    "we performed a detailed investigation of the 1860 kev ibis / isgri long - term light curve on scw timescale of igr j17354@xmath03255 ( total on source time @xmath1 10 ms ) to fully characterize for the first time its temporal behaviour .",
    "we found that most of the time the source is not significantly detected at scw level ( 2@xmath14 upper limit of @xmath110 mcrab ) and it is well below the instrumental sensitivity of ibis / isgri .",
    "this is very likely the reason why the source was not reported in the 2nd ibis catalog ( bird et al .",
    "2006 ) despite the region of the sky was observed for a total exposure time of @xmath11.6 ms . on the contrary ,",
    "the source is listed in the subsequent 3th and 4th ibis catalogs ( bird et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) with a similar 1860 ( 2040 ) kev average flux of @xmath1 1.7 mcrab ( 1.4 mcrab ) ; this is very likely due to the significantly longer time intervals analyzed in the 3th ( @xmath1 4.5 ms ) and 4th ibis catalog ( @xmath1 7.6 ms ) with respect to the 2nd one .",
    "in addition , we also investigated the ibis light curve in order to unveil a possible flaring behaviour of igr j17354@xmath03255 .",
    "to this aim , we only considered those flares having a peak - flux greater than @xmath1 20 mcrab or 2.6@xmath310@xmath15 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ( 1860 kev ) ; we adopted such conservative peak - flux threshold for flare recognition for two main reasons : i ) it corresponds to a source significance equal to or greater than @xmath14@xmath14 in the single scw containing the peak of the flare , ii ) to pick up flares bright enough to extract a meaningful isgri spectrum . by applying this criterion ,",
    "a total of 16 x - ray flares have been detected over a total exposure of @xmath1 115 days though not in sequence , as listed in table 1 together with the date of the peak emission , approximate duration and significance detection of the entire outburst activity , flux at the peak .",
    "we note that all but one are newly discovered flares and are reported for the first time , their typical duration is only a few hours ( 0.55 h ) , however the source occasionally displays x - ray activity over a period of a few days ( 13 d ) .",
    "the typical peak - flux is in a narrow range @xmath1 2030 mcrab but also brighter flares occur ( @xmath1 3545 mcrab ) .",
    "the strongest as well as shortest outburst ( n.2 in table 1 ) was detected only during one scw lasting half an hour .",
    "such fast x - ray transient behaviour is evident from fig . 1 and 2 which show the ibis / isgri light curve on scw timescale and the corresponding sequence of consecutive scws significance images , respectively .",
    "in particular , the inset in fig . 1 represents a zoomed view with a bin time of 200 seconds , i.e. significantly smaller than that at scw timescale .",
    "the outburst is characterized by two fast flares lasting a few minutes , the strongest one reached a peak - flux of 108@xmath1620 mcrab or ( 1.41@xmath160.26)@xmath310@xmath17 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 .      in order to search for any evidence of periodicity",
    ", we investigated the ibis long - term light curve of igr j17354@xmath03255 using the lomb - scargle periodogram method by means of the fast implementation of press & rybicki ( 1989 ) and scargle ( 1982 ) .",
    "a clear signal is seen at 8.4474 days as shown in fig .",
    "the 99.999% confidence level was defined at a power of 20.214 by using a randomisation test with 200,00 trials , as outlined in hill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , hence the detected periodic signal is the only significant peak within the power spectrum . using a variant of the randomisation test as outlined in drave et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the error on this peak was calculated as 0.0017 days .",
    "we interpret the periodicity of 8.4474@xmath160.0017 days as the orbital period of the binary system , providing a strong confirmation of the result recently reported by dai et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with _ swift_/bat data",
    "4 shows the phase folded light curve where it is evident a smooth orbital modulation of the flux ; it peaks during the periastron passage and becomes consistent with zero around apastron .",
    "we note that the feature at phase @xmath1 0.5 is due to the binning and is not taken as being of physical origin .",
    "the red crosses indicate the outbursts detected by ibis ( listed in table 1 ) within these orbital ephemeris .",
    "as clearly evident their occurrence is consistent with the region of orbital phase around periastron .",
    "the shape of the orbital profile shown in fig .",
    "4 is rather smooth and appears to be dominated by lower level x - ray emission rather than by the outbursts . to test this assumption we employed the recurrence analysis technique which searches for periastron detections ( bird et al .",
    "2009 ) by summing the x - ray emission during each periastron passage within a set window of 3 days ( periastron @xmath16 1.5 days ) .",
    "the source could then be detected even though a significant detection is not achieved in the individual scws .",
    "the same process was performed for each apastron passage and the distributions compared .",
    "5 shows the recurrence analysis results , there is a clear excess in detections above 3@xmath14 during the periastron passages , corresponding to detectable emission on about 26% of periastron passages covered by the data set .",
    "this value is taken as a lower limit as there may still be emission that is occurring during other periastron passages that is below the sensitivity of ibis / isgri . on the contrary",
    "no detections above 3@xmath14 are recorded during apastron passages .",
    "our recurrence analysis suggests that the 16 individual outbursts detected by ibis / isgri can not explain the smooth shape seen in the phase folded light curve . assuming a source distance of 8.5 kpc ( see section 1 ) these outbursts all have x - ray luminosities in excess of 10@xmath18 erg s@xmath6 and represent the most luminous outburst events .",
    "hence we would not expect these events to define the orbital emission profile over the extent of these long baseline observations .",
    "instead we attribute the shape to lower level emission that is below the instrumental sensitivity of ibis / isgri in an individual scw ( i.e. @xmath1 10 mcrab ) .",
    "however when the whole data set , covering about 300 orbital cycles of 8.4 days , is folded this emission sums to a significant detection and reveals the smooth profile shown in fig .",
    "4 . this emission could be either smoothly varying following a similar profile during each orbit or the super position of many low intensity flares at fluxes of @xmath1 10@xmath1910@xmath20 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "such flaring activity was demonstrated occurring in the sfxt igr j18483@xmath00311 by romano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who estimated the probability of observing the source in a non - flaring state ( i.e. @xmath21 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath6 ) as only @xmath1 25% through observations covering an entire orbital period with swift / xrt . due to the sensitivity limits of ibis / isgri and the different observing strategy",
    "however it is not possible to define which of these processes is occurring in this system and draw any conclusions as to the stellar wind configurations that could be responsible for this effect .      the 1550 kev _",
    "swift_/bat light curve on daily timescale was inspected searching for outbursts .",
    "we considered only those detected with a significance greater than 5@xmath14 .",
    "only one significant outburst was clearly found ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , peaking at mjd 55145 ( 10 november 2009 ) with a flux of ( 2.8@xmath160.54)@xmath310@xmath17 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 or @xmath1 220 mcrab ( 1550 kev ) . the total outburst duration was @xmath1 6 days , for a significance detection of @xmath1 6.5@xmath14 .",
    "_ swift_/bat observations covered april 2009 through may 2011 and they are not overlaped with those performed by integral / ibis which on the contrary covered february 2003 through october 2008 . the apparent incongruence between the number of flares seen by ibis ( 16 ) and bat ( 1 ) in almost the same energy band could be reasonably explained by the significantly different dataset as well as instrumental capabilities .",
    "in fact , bat observations had an effective exposure time of @xmath1 6.4 ms which is significantly smaller than that of integrali / ibis ( @xmath1 10 ms ) .",
    "in addition , table 1 clearly shows that about 70% of the outbursts detected by ibis / isgri have typical duration and flux of few hours and 2040 mcrab , respectively .",
    "longer flares ( i.e. few days duration ) are rarer . clearly ibis / isgri is particularly suited to the detection of short events thanks to its high instantaneous sensitivity for short observations on @xmath1 2000 seconds scw lengths ( i.e. @xmath1 10 mcrab ) which match very well the duration of the flares .",
    "on the contrary , bat is more suited to long - term monitoring thanks to its much more continuous coverage but could eventually miss the detection of shorter flares ( i.e. few hours duration ) which , if close to the ibis sensitivity , are very likely not detectable by bat due to its poorer instantaneous sensitivity .",
    "in fact , the minimum detectable flux by bat depends on both the exposure and the position of the source in the sky .",
    "for the median bat pointing duration of @xmath1 1000 seconds and a source near the center of the bat fov , a 6@xmath14 detection corresponds to a minimum detectable flux of approximately 60 mcrab . in the daily averages it corresponds to approximately 15 mcrab ( krimm et al .",
    "2006 ) .    regarding _",
    "swift_/xrt , the region of the sky including igr j17354@xmath03255 was observed on 17 april 2009 ( @xmath1 5.3 ks exposure ) .",

    "a single bright x - ray counterpart was clearly detected inside the ibis error circle ( see inset in fig .",
    "the 0.210 kev light curve ( 200 seconds bin time ) of this x - ray counterpart is shown in fig .",
    "it is evident that at the beginning the source count rate was very low , after which several fast x - ray flares occurred and the strongest one reached a peak - flux of ( 8.7@xmath161.1)@xmath310@xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 . throughout the entire _",
    "swift_/xrt observation , lasting @xmath1 8 hours , the source was strongly variable displaying a dynamic range of @xmath1 50 .",
    "to date no spectral information above 20 kev on x - ray flares from igr j17354@xmath03255 has been available .",
    "the number of flares reported in table 1 allows a spectral study for the first time .",
    "we were able to extract a meaningful ibis / isgri spectrum only from the flares having a significance detection @xmath2 5@xmath14 .",
    "due to the limited statistics we performed a fit by using only a simple power law model whose spectral parameters are listed in table 1 ( photon index , @xmath11 , d.o.f . ) .",
    "the photon indices are not well constrained because of the limited statistics , however their best fit values fall in the range @xmath7=23 and this could suggest a rather constant soft spectral shape from flare to flare .",
    "bearing this in mind and to improve the statistics , the ibis / isgri spectra from all flares were summed up together and fit with a power law model ( @xmath11=1.4 , 15 d.o.f . ) , providing a much better constrained photon index of @xmath7=2.4@xmath160.4 ( see fig .",
    "8 , top spectrum ) .    during just two flares ( n. 8 and 9 in table 1 ) the source was inside the fov of the x - ray monitor jem - x , although for very short time ( @xmath1 1 ks and 0.5 ks , respectively ) because of its much smaller fov with respect to that of ibis / isgri .",
    "the source was not detected , providing a loose 3@xmath14 upper limit of @xmath1 5@xmath310@xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 in both 310 and 320 kev energy bands .",

    "however we point out that whereas classical sfxts have a remarkable dynamical range of @xmath1 10@xmath3010@xmath31 , we found for igr j17354@xmath03255 significantly lower values , in the range 21200 ( 1860 kev ) and @xmath2311 ( 0.210 kev ) .",
    "although igr j17354@xmath03255 can not be considered a classical sfxt , still its dynamical range is significantly greater than that of classical persistent supergiant hmxbs known to display variability of factors lower than @xmath1 20 ( walter & zurita 2007 ) .",
    "therefore we suggest that igr j17354@xmath03255 is an intermediate sfxt system , much like several similar cases reported in the literature ( clark et al .",
    "2010 , walter & zurita 2007 , sguera et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "in addition , our ibis timing analysis of the source identified an orbital period of 8.4474@xmath160.0017 days , strongly confirming the previous detection with _",
    "swift_/bat ( dai et al .",
    "the occurrence of the outbursts detected by ibis is consistent with the region of orbital phase around periastron .",
    "the calculated lower limit on the recurrence rate of the source ( i.e. detected outbursts when predicted by the @xmath1 8.4 days period ) is @xmath1 26% , this is the second highest value of any known sfxt after that of sax j1818.6@xmath01703 ( @xmath150% , bird et al .",
    "we suggest that igr j17354@xmath03255 is a sfxt system similar to sax j1818.6@xmath01703 ( bird et al .",
    "2009 ) , but with a shorter orbit and a lower eccentricity of @xmath1 0.10.2 to account for the reduced recurrence rate .",
    "the shape of the orbital profile is very smooth , conversely that of other known sfxts is sharper .",
    "our recurrence analysis suggests that the sixteen individual outbursts detected by ibis / isgri , which all have x - ray luminosities in excess of 10@xmath18 erg s@xmath6 and represent the most luminous outburst events , can not explain such smooth shape . instead we attribute it to a lower level x - ray emission that is below the instrumental sensitivity of ibis / isgri in an individual scw",
    ". this emission could be either smoothly varying following a similar profile during each orbit or the super position of many low intensity flares at x - ray luminosities of @xmath1 10@xmath19  10@xmath32 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , due to the sensitivity limits of ibis / isgri in such short period , it is not possible to define which of these processes is occurring in this system and draw any conclusions .",
    "we note that the @xmath1 8.4 days orbital period of igr j17354@xmath03255 is significantly longer than those typical of low mass x - ray binaries ( @xmath210.5 d ) and it is significantly shorter than those of be hmxb systems ( @xmath2 30 days ) . on the contrary , it is more typical of sgxbs ( 212 d ) providing further strong support to the hypothesis that the companion donor is a supergiant star . in this respect , only one bright 2mass counterpart is located inside the chandra error circle of igr j17354@xmath03255 while there are no catalogued usno optical objects .",
    "spectroscopy of this infrared counterpart is essential to fully characterize it .",
    "the high inferred optical extinction and the relatively high x - ray column density suggest that igr j17354@xmath03255 is located at a relatively large distance , i.e. near the galactic center region ( d@xmath18.5 kpc ) .",
    "if we assume such a distance , then the source displays typical outbursts x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath1810@xmath33 erg s@xmath6 ( 1860 kev ) while its lowest x - ray luminosity state is @xmath212.4@xmath310@xmath19 erg s@xmath6 ( 0.210 kev ) .",
    "such values are very similar to those of known firm sfxts .",
    "our deep integral significance mosaic maps both at soft ( 310 kev ) and hard x - rays ( 1860 kev ) , combined with a refined agile positional uncertainty , revealed that igr j17354@xmath03255 is the only x - ray source unambigously located inside the error circle of the unidentified transient mev source agl j1734@xmath03310 .",
    "this spatial association is enforced by our temporal findings which unveiled for the first time the recurrent x - ray flaring behaviour of igr j17354@xmath03255 on short timescale ( from few hours to few days ) , i.e. a characteristic very similar to that observed with agile from agl j1734@xmath03310 .",
    "we took into account the possibility of a chance coincidence and to this aim we calculated the probability of finding a supergiant hmxb , such as igr j17354@xmath03255 , inside the agile error circle by chance .",
    "given the number of supergiant hmxbs detected by ibis within the galactic plane ( bird et al .",
    "2010 ) , defined here as restricted to a latitude range of @xmath165 degrees , we estimated a probability of @xmath1 1% , i.e. @xmath1 0.5 chance coincidences are expected .",
    "it is noteworthy that the possible association between igr j17354@xmath03255 and agl j1734@xmath03310 might not be a unique and rare case .",
    "so far three hmxbs ( ls 5039 , lsi + 61 303 , psr b1259@xmath063 ) have been unambiguously detected both at mev and tev energies as persistent and variable sources , where the variability is modulated by the orbital period ( paredes 2008 , hill et al .",
    "2010 ) . in additon ,",
    "the two hxmbs cygnus x-3 and cygnus x-1 have been detected at mev energies as transient sources displaying fast flares with a short duration of a few hours / days ( sabatini et al .",
    "2010 , tavani et al .",
    "2009 , abdo et al .",
    "different theoretical models have been proposed to explain the emission mechanism at such high energies in hmxb systems ( bosch - ramon et al .",
    "2006 , paredes et al .",
    "2006 , romero et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , maraschi & treves 1981 , tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "similarly , sfxts have all the ingredients to possibly be mev / tev emitters since they host a compact object ( black hole or neutron star ) and a massive supergiant star which could be the source of seed photons ( for the inverse compton emission ) and target nuclei ( for hadronic interactions ) .",
    "however , due to their transitory nature , mev / tev emission from sfxts must be in the form of fast flares which are not easy to detect . despite this",
    ", a few sfxts have been proposed in the literature as best candidate counterparts of unidentified transient mev sources located on the galactic plane ( sguera et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) . in this respect ,",
    "we propose the candidate intermediate sfxt igr j17354@xmath03255 as best candidate counterpart of agl j1734@xmath03310 .",
    "although we are aware that the reported evidences are so far circumstantial , the eventual confirmation of a common nature would have very major implications : the sfxts could represent a new class of mev / gev emitting galactic transients .",
    "to this aim , further and deeper multiwavelength studies of igr j17354@xmath03255 and agl j1734@xmath03310 are strongly needed especially in radio and at gamma - rays .",
    "in particular , a periodicity analysis of the mev emission from agl j1734@xmath03310 is essential to support a secure identification with igr j17354@xmath03255 .",
    "these kind of temporal studies can be performed by the current gamma - ray instrumentations , such as fermi / lat or agile , as amply proved by the lat detections of periodic mev emission from several hmxb systems ( e.g. hill et al .",
    "on - going regular and frequent scannings of the galactic bulge and plane with integral , together with observations from fermi / lat and agile , could likely shed new light on the proposed association .",
    "we thank the referee for useful comments which improved the quality of the paper .",
    "vs is very grateful to andrea bulgarelli and the agile team for sharing the results on agl j1734@xmath03310 before publication .",
