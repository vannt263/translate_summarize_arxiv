    "the casimir force between two uncharged macroscopic bodies in vacuum is widely regarded as arising from the zero - point fluctuations intrinsic to any quantum system . in the case of two flat parallel plates a distance @xmath3 apart",

    "several groups have performed high - precision measurements of the casimir force between a flat plate and a spherical surface ( lens ) or a sphere @xcite , and also between two parallel flat plates @xcite . in the last case",
    "the original casimir formula was confirmed to @xmath5 accuracy .    due to its fundamental character",
    "the casimir effect has applications in many areas of physics , ranging from the theory of elementary particles and interactions @xcite to atomic and molecular physics @xcite .",
    "besides , it has analogues in condensed matter physics , for instance in fluctuation induced forces @xcite and boundary critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "more recently , its relevance to the design and operation of micro- and nano - scale electromechanical devices has been emphasized @xcite .",
    "usually the details of the interaction between the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum field and the macroscopic bodies are neglected , and replaced by classical boundary conditions ( bc ) at the boundary of the latter .",

    "a field @xmath6 is said to obey robin boundary condition at a surface @xmath7 if its normal derivative at a point on @xmath7 is proportional to its value there : @xmath8 neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions are particular cases of robin boundary condition : the first one corresponds to @xmath9 ; the other is obtained in the limit @xmath10 ( assuming that @xmath11 is bounded ) .",

    "its starting point is the introduction of suitable boundary terms in the action , which allows us to compute the partition function of the system without the explicit imposition of robin bc on the fields . in spite of",
