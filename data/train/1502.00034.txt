    "after the initial run of the lhc , the constraints on new physics are rather severe @xcite .",
    "although models can still be made to realize weak - scale mass spectra , sfermion masses of generic models like the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) @xcite are now required to be larger than about a tev . as a result , the naturalness of supersymmetry ( susy ) has been called into question . however , it was perhaps naive to expect nature to fall into our strict definition of naturalness with less than @xmath5 fine - tuning .",
    "supersymmetry , with sfermion masses larger than a tev , still solves the larger hierarchy problem associated with grand unification and/or the plank scale .",
    "furthermore , if the sfermion masses are set by the gravitino mass , @xmath6 , and are larger than about 10 tev , the gravitino lifetime is short enough that it decays before bbn @xcite . moreover , as the mass scale of the sfermions is pushed beyond the weak scale , the constraints on susy models from flavor and cp violation in the sfermion sector are greatly relaxed @xcite .",
    "these advantages , plus the fact that sfermion masses this large are consistent with a larger higgs mass like the @xmath7  gev higgs boson seen at the lhc @xcite suggest we relax our strict definition of naturalness .",
    "large sfermion masses like those found in split supersymmetry @xcite are realized in models such as pure gravity mediation ( pgm ) @xcite , which can be parametrized by a single parameter @xcite @xmath6 .",
    "this minimal model of pure gravity mediation is similar in many ways to minimal supergravity ( msugra ) .",
    "universal masses equal to @xmath6 are imposed at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale based on the assumption that the khler manifold is flat for all matter fields . unlike the cmssm , gauginos",
    "do not get a tree - level mass .",
    "this is because the supersymmetry breaking field is not a singlet and so is excluded from coupling to the gauge kinetic function to leading order .",
    "thus , the leading order contribution to the mass of the gauginos comes from anomaly mediation @xcite and is loop suppressed relative to the sfermion masses .",
    "the @xmath8-term , which contributes to electroweak symmetry breaking , is identical to that in msugra , @xmath9 .",
    "however , since the @xmath10-terms of pgm are effectively zero , @xmath11 and @xmath8 is fixed for a given value of @xmath6 .",
    "this makes radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) difficult .",
    "however , by adding a giudice - masiero term @xcite , @xmath8 is no longer fixed by @xmath6 alone , but also depends on the coupling of the giudice - masiero term .",
    "this additional freedom in @xmath8 makes radiative ewsb possible , but only for small values of @xmath12 .",
    "once the higgs mass constraint is taken into consideration , these models have a single free parameter which is some combination of @xmath6 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , because @xmath12 is restricted to be less than about 3 , @xmath6 tends to be rather large .",
    "the constraints on @xmath12 can be removed , if the higgs soft masses at the gut scale are taken to be non - universal @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath6 can be taken to be smaller for larger values of @xmath12 .",
    "another important motivation for susy is grand unification @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the gauge couplings approach each other as they are run up to the high scale @xcite . however , the quality of the coupling unification is less than convincing .",
    "if the sm is supersymmetrized , on the other hand , the unification of the gauge couplings becomes quite good @xcite .",
    "furthermore , grand unification in the sm would generate enormous quadratic divergences for the higgs boson .",
    "however , these quadratic divergences are significantly reduced for supersymmetric grand unified theories , even if the sfermions are larger than a tev .",
    "clearly , grand unification is another motivation for pgm .",
    "the signatures of these simple pgm - type models are limited .",
    "one possible signature at the lhc for small @xmath6 is the wino @xcite . for larger @xmath6 , on the other hand ,",
    "the wino can not be seen at the lhc but could be a viable thermal relic dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it could be seen by indirect detection experiments in the near future @xcite",
    ". however , this scenario is already under tension from existing indirect detection experiments @xcite . the direct detection of wino dark matter is challenging as its scattering cross section with a nucleon is as small as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a higgsino signature at the lhc is another possible observable which arises from tuning @xmath14 to be small @xcite .",
    "however , this is also difficult to see .",
    "this scenario could also have higgsino - like dark matter which could possibly be seen in future indirect detection experiments @xcite .",
    "the scattering cross section of the higgsino with a nucleon is dependent on the size of the wino component of the lsp , and may be probed in future experiments @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will examine another possible signature of these models .",
    "since the colored triplet higgs gives threshold corrections to the gauge couplings when integrated out , the quality of the coupling unification determines the mass of the colored triplet higgs @xcite and so affects the lifetime of the proton . when the colored higgs is integrated out , it also generates a dimension - five operator proportional to down - type yukawa couplings which lead to proton decay @xcite .",
    "since this dimension - five operator is proportional to the down - type yukawa couplings , it will be enhanced for large @xmath12 .",
    "proton decay from this dimension - five operator arises from a loop diagram with a higgsino mass insertion @xcite .",
    "proton decay of this type can then be suppressed for small @xmath14 .",
    "when unification is not ideal and @xmath12 is large , a larger higgsino mass can increase the rate of proton decay from this dimension 5 operator .",
    "parameters of this size are viable in pgm models . since proton decay of this type",
    "is also suppressed by @xmath6 , the more interesting parameter space will be for smaller @xmath6 and larger @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we will need to consider non - universal higgs soft masses .",
    "we will find that if @xmath6 is small and @xmath12 is larger , which is also consistent with the higgs mass measurement , the proton lifetime may be in reach of future experiments .",
    "however , for much of the parameter space the lifetime tends to be well beyond the reach of future experiments .",
    "we will also look at the quality of the gauge coupling unification determined by the deviation of the colored triplet higgs mass , @xmath15 , from the gut - scale as well as the deviation of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the gut scale su(5 ) gauge bosons that become massive and @xmath18 is the @xmath19 which breaks su(5 ) at the gut scale .",
    "in this section , we will outline the su(5 ) susy gut theory @xcite we will consider .",
    "additional details on these models can be found in appendix [ app : notcon ] .",
    "the superpotential for this minimal su(5 ) susy gut is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22@xmath23 represent the su(5 ) indices and @xmath24 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the chiral superfields in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 representations , respectively , with @xmath30 denoting the generation index . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath33 and @xmath34 containing the mininal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) doublets . in these expressions , we have assumed @xmath35-parity conservation which forbids terms like @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the adjoint higgs field , @xmath18 , gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) in the direction @xmath38 breaking the su(5 ) gauge group to the sm gauge groups su(3)@xmath39su(2)@xmath40u(1)@xmath41 . because susy remains unbroken for su(5 ) breaking , we have @xmath42 . for this setup ,",
    "the masses of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are given as @xmath47 while the @xmath14 term for the mssm higgs fields is @xmath48 as is usually done , we tune the parameter @xmath49 to realize @xmath50 which is typically referred to as the doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "parameter is taken to be larger , while the doublet - triplet fine - tuning becomes less severe .",
    "this tension may explain why @xmath14 is much larger than the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "] in addition , the gauge interactions of the adjoint higgs field yield an @xmath17-boson mass of @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the unified gauge coupling constant .",
    "the components @xmath53 and @xmath54 become the longitudinal component of the @xmath17 bosons , and thus do not appear as physical states .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ superpotentialyukawa ] ) have redundant degrees of freedom , most of which are eliminated by the field redefinition of @xmath57 and @xmath58 . since @xmath55 is a symmetric matrix , @xmath55 and @xmath56 have six and nine complex degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the field redefinition of the sm fields forms the u(3)@xmath59u(3 ) transformation group , and thus the physical degrees of freedom turn out to be @xmath60 . among these degrees of freedom , six of them are the quark mass eigenvalues and four are for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and we are left with two phases @xcite . in this paper , we take the same basis used in ref .",
    "@xcite such that @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the up - type and down - type yukawa couplings , respectively , at a scale @xmath64 around the gut scale , and @xmath65 is the ckm matrix .",
    "the phase factors @xmath66 satisfy the condition @xmath67 , and thus only two of them are independent . in this basis , the mssm superfields are embedded into the su(5 ) matter multiplets as @xmath68 then , eq .   leads to @xmath69 & -\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\varphi_i}\\epsilon_{abc}f_{u_i } ( q^{a}_i \\cdot q^{b}_i ) h^c_c + v^*_{ij}f_{d_j}(q^{a}_i\\cdot l_j)\\overline{h}_{ca } \\nonumber \\\\[2pt ] & + f_{u_i}v_{ij}\\overline{u}_{ia } \\overline{e}_jh^a_c -v^*_{ij}f_{d_j}e^{-i\\varphi_i}\\epsilon^{abc } \\overline{u}_{ia}\\overline{d}_{jb}\\overline{h}_{cc}~. \\label{eq : wyukawa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the new phase factors appear only in the couplings of the color - triplet higgs multiplets .",
    "to compute the proton decay rate , we need to evaluate the masses of the gut - scale particles which induce the baryon - number violating interactions . in this section",
    ", we estimate these masses using the method discussed in refs .",
    "the mass of the heavy particles is determined by first rg running the couplings to the scale where they approximately unify . then , because the thresholds at the gut scale depend on these superheavy particles , their masses can be determined by assuming the deviation in gauge coupling unification is solely due to these thresholds .",
    "note , we will use the @xmath70 scheme @xcite in the following calculation . at the scale @xmath71 near the gut scale ,",
    "the one - loop matching conditions for the gauge coupling constants are as follows @xcite : @xmath72~,\\nonumber \\\\",

    "note that the conditions do not include constant ( scale independent ) terms since we use the @xmath74 scheme for renormalization .",
    "assuming the above equations contain the major thresholds for the gauge couplings , they can be used to solve for the masses @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the above expressions allow us to find the masses of the heavy particles in the combination . ] , @xmath15 and @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath15 and @xmath78 found from these relationships will be used below to find the lifetime of the proton .",
    "in the minimal susy gut , proton decay is induced by the exchange of the color - triplet higgs boson , and the dominant decay mode is , generally , @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "we will only give details of the contributions from the colored higgs boson since it will often be the dominant source of proton decay in pgm . at the gut scale ,",
    "the triplet higgs boson is integrated out .",
    "the most important interaction for our considerations is the color - triplet higgs exchange which we match at the scale @xmath71 on to the dimension - five effective lagrangian @xmath80 where the effective operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 are defined by @xmath83 and the wilson coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 are given by @xmath86 note , the color indices must be completely antisymmetric for these interactions and as a result , only operators with at least two generations will be allowed .",
    "for this reason , the dominant decay modes contain a strange quark in their final state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79 .    as can be seen in eq .  , at the gut scale the lepton and down - type quark yukawa couplings should be equal .",
    "however , in running up from the weak scale , we find them to be quite different especially those for the first two generations .",
    "the difference is , however , easily compensated by effects above the gut scale ; for instance , the higher - dimensional operators induced at the planck scale contribute to the yukawa couplings , which may account for this difference @xcite .",
    "because it is not known which of these values is close to the correct value for the yukawa coupling at the gut scale , in the the discussion below , we use both the down quark and lepton - type yukawa couplings to calculate the proton lifetime .",
    "this will allow us to quantify our uncertainty in the lifetime of the proton .",
    "the relevant operators in eq .   can be further reduced by keeping only those with the largest yukawa couplings .",
    "we find that only the operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 yield a sizable contribution to proton decay , even though the contribution is suppressed by a flavor changing element of the ckm matrix .",
    "this contribution turns out to be dominant because of the large third generation yukawa couplings involved @xcite .",
    "the relevant wilson coefficients are then @xmath89 notice that the coefficients include a common phase factor @xmath90 , which is therefore not important for proton decay .",
    "the wilson coefficients in eq .",
    "are then evolved down to the susy scale . at the susy scale ,",
    "the sfermions of these dimension - five operators are integrated out via the one - loop diagram found in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] of appendix  [ app : prodec ] .",
    "the process proceeds via the exchange of either a charged wino or a higgsino . in pgm",
    ", we generally have @xmath91 and so the contribution from higgsino exchange dominates @xcite . given in eq .  .",
    "] for these reasons , we focus on the charged higgsino exchange process in what follows .",

    "the loop function @xmath96 is found in appendix [ app : prodec ] .",
    "the above expression shows that the proton decay rate depends on the susy spectra through the loop function .",
    "we will see this dependence in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] for the pgm scenario . note that the loop function is suppressed by the sfermion masses .",
    "thus , we expect that for large @xmath6 the proton lifetime is long enough @xcite to evade the current bound , @xmath97  years @xcite .",
    "this can be compared to the weak - scale susy scenarios ; in these cases , the proton decay rate is in general predicted to be so large that the minimal susy gut is excluded @xcite and thus some additional conspiracy is required to realize a susy gut .",

    "can also be generated at the planck scale , @xmath106 .",
    "if the coefficients of the operators are @xmath107 , that is , there is no suppression from yukawa couplings , then they will give the dominant contribution to proton decay and result in a lifetime which is too short @xcite .",
    "it is expected , however , that there is some underlying mechanism such as a flavor symmetry which is responsible for the structure of the yukawa couplings .",
    "this symmetry could give additional suppression to these planck - scale operators .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the contribution of these operators is less significant compared with the color higgs contribution , and neglect them in the following analysis .",
    "secondly , the exchange of the @xmath17 bosons will also induce proton decay .",

    "[ muma ] , we show a two - parameter extension of the two - parameter pgm similar to the nuhm2 @xcite .",
    "results are displayed in the @xmath167 plane for fixed @xmath168 and @xmath124 tev . in this case , the ewsb conditions , are used to solve for the two higgs soft masses which now differ",
    ". as the higgs mass is largely independent of @xmath122 , the higgs mass contours are nearly vertical . at the center of the plot ,",
    "as @xmath169 gets to be very small , @xmath170 gets large and exceeds 130 gev . at large @xmath169",
    ", @xmath170 is always larger than 125 gev in the ranges shown .",
    "the threshold corrections to the wino mass are sensitive to @xmath14 and @xmath122 and that accounts for the variation of @xmath127 as these parameters are varied .",
    "the proton lifetime varies between @xmath171 and @xmath149 years but shows significantly more variability .",
    "this is due to the competing effects of changing @xmath14 .",
    "the proton lifetime depends both on the color - triplet higgs mass and on @xmath14 itself . through the loop function @xmath96 in eq .  .",
    "when @xmath172 , @xmath173 , while if @xmath174 , @xmath175 , as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "] as @xmath14 is lowered , the color - triplet higgs mass decreases which tends to decrease the proton lifetime .",
    "but as @xmath169 is further decreased , the proton lifetime dependence on @xmath14 overcomes its dependence on @xmath15 and the lifetime increases very rapidly at small @xmath169 seen by the sharp downturn in the contours near @xmath176 .",
    "these effects can be better understood by examining figs .",
    "[ tpmu ] and [ mmu ] which show the behavior of the proton lifetime and gut - scale masses , including the heavy higgs mass , as a function of @xmath14 for fixed @xmath119 and @xmath6 . here",
    "we see the first gradual and then rapid decrease in the color - triplet mass as @xmath169 is lowered from large values toward @xmath176 .",
    "there is no substantial difference in this behavior between the two values of @xmath119 shown .",
    "once again , we see that @xmath78 depends very little on our parameter choices and is always near @xmath154  gev .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ mmu ] , we see the sharp increase in the proton lifetime as @xmath169 gets small",
    ". much greater than the wino mass . ] here we see also that the higgs mass rises sharply as @xmath14 tends to zero .",
    "it is important to recall that the lifetime plotted corresponds only to that given by the dimension - five operator given in eq .   and would not exceed @xmath177 years when the dimension - six operator is included .",
    "the latter is fairly insensitive to parameter choices .",
    "as we await new results for physics beyond the standard model from the lhc , we have been forced to consider supersymmetric models with sfermion masses larger than what was previously considered ` natural ' .",
    "while a great deal of attention had been focused on relatively simple models such as the cmssm or msugra ( with four and three parameters respectively ) or the nuhm1,2 with five and six parameters , pure gravity mediation models can be described with as few as two parameters at the cost of a mass spectrum which approaches the pev scale . as we hope",
    "the actual theory of nature is in the realm of experimental science , it is imperative to find means to test these models .",
    "here we have examined one additional possibility for testing these models despite their generally heavy mass spectra .",
    "pgm theories , with all their economy , are still able to resolve many of the questions their lower energy cousins ( such as the cmssm ) were motivated from .",
    "these include the ability to achieve gauge coupling unification at the gut scale , radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry , the stability of the higgs potential , and they also provide a suitable candidate for dark matter .",
    "the latter is definitely more difficult in pgm models , as the wino is usually the lightest supersymmetric particle and as such would require a wino mass near 3 tev to supply the correct relic density .",
    "this pushes the gravitino mass up to several hundred tev .",
    "alternatives within pgm are possible if @xmath14 is relatively small and the higgsino is the lightest supersymmetric particle @xcite or if the theory contains additional vector - like states and bino - gluino co - annihilation controls the relic bino density @xcite , or even axion dark matter @xcite .",
    "in contrast to their lower energy counterparts , pgm models have a relatively easy time obtaining a higgs mass in agreement with the experimental measurement @xcite .",
    "thus experimental verification of pgm models remains challenging . while there is the chance that the lightest supersymmetric particle is within reach of the lhc , the bulk of the pgm spectrum is not .",
    "here we have calculated the proton lifetime in pgm models .",
    "we have found that typically the lifetime is long and in many cases significantly above the current experimental bounds . however in cases where @xmath6 is relatively small and @xmath119 is relatively high , the proton lifetime is low and may be at the level of current experimental searches . while proton decay itself , can not point directly to pgm supersymmetry , it may provide one more handle on an ever increasingly elusive theory beyond the standard model .",
