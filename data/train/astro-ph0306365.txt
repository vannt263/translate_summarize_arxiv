    "several lines of evidence indicate that the universe contains a large amount of nonbaryonic dark matter .",
    "the most plausible candidates for this nonbaryonic dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) provided by the supersymmetry in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) .",
    "lsps can be directly detected through their elastic scattering off target nuclei in a detector @xcite .",
    "many experiments have been performed for the direct detection of wimps . among them",
    ", the dama experiment has reported an annual modulation signal from the four years measurement with nine 10 kg nai(tl ) detectors @xcite .",
    "the parameters reported by the dama experiment are @xmath3 gev for the wimp mass and @xmath4 pb for the wimp - proton spin - independently ( si ) coupled cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "the cdms @xcite and edelweiss @xcite experiments have excluded most of the parameter space claimed by the dama experiment under the assumptions of standard wimp interactions and a halo model . since the cross section for the wimp - nucleus elastic scattering is given by the sum of si and spin - dependent ( sd ) terms , the dark matter search experiments should be performed both via si and sd interactions . in an si and",
    "sd mixed framework  @xcite , @xmath5 could be as high as 0.6 pb for 3080 gev wimps in the dama allowed region under the assumptions of certain parameter sets .",
    "since the limits for sd wimp - proton cross section , @xmath5 , obtained by the conventional method @xcite are highly wimp model dependent , both @xmath5 and sd wimp - neutron cross section , @xmath6 , limits or the limits in terms of the fundamental wimp - nucleon coupling coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be derived @xcite .",
    "we , the tokyo group , reported our previous results with the lithium fluoride ( lif ) bolometer at kamioka observatory ( 2700 m.w.e . )",
    "@xcite , and set the new limits in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane .",
    "we compared our results with those of the ukdmc experiments @xcite , and tightened the ukdmc s limits that are close to the dama s sd allowed region in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a sodium fluoride ( naf ) bolometer array , and performed a dark matter search measurement from 2002 through 2003 . since @xmath7 has a larger expectation value of the neutron spins than @xmath8 as shown in table [ tablespsn ]",
    ", we were able to tighten the limits from the previous experiment @xcite in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results from a dark matter search experiment performed at kamioka observatory using the naf bolometer array .",
    "the present data were collected at the kamioka observatory under a 2700 m.w.e . rock overburden located at mozumi mine of the kamioka mining and smelting co. in kamioka - cho , gifu , japan .",
    "details of the underground laboratory and the experimental set - up are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the detector is an array of eight naf bolometers with a total mass of 176 g. each bolometer consists of @xmath9 naf crystal and a neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) germanium thermistor glued to it .",
    "each ntd thermistor is biased through a 300 m@xmath10 load resistor , and the voltage change across the thermistor is fed to the voltage sensitive amplifier with a gain of 10 placed at the 4 k cold stage .",
    "the signal from the cold stage amplifier is in turn amplified by the voltage amplifier with a gain of @xmath11 placed at the room temperature , and is digitized with a sampling rate of 1 khz .",
    "all the data are recorded continuously without any online trigger for a complete offline analysis .",
    "we refer to each bolometer as from d1 to d8 .",
    "five of the naf crystals are purchased from ohyo koken kogyo co. ltd .",
    ", two of them are from rare metallic co. ltd . , and the other is from material technology co. ltd .",
    "we used the ntd thermistors , which are referred to as ntd3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the eight bolometers .",
    "the concentration of radioactive contaminations in the naf crystals was previously checked with a low - background germanium spectrometer placed at kamioka observatory ( 2700 m.w.e . ) , and was found to be less than 0.1 ppb for u , 1 ppb for th , and 2 ppm for k. in order to eliminate remaining grains of the polishing powder , surfaces of the naf crystals were etched with ultra - pure water in a clean bench of class 100 .",
    "the bolometer array is encapsulated in an inner lead shield with a thickness of 2 cm . in the previous measurement ,",
    "this inner shield was made of over 200 years old lead .",
    "we used a new inner shield with a low - radioactivity lead older than 400 years for this experiment .",
    "from 23rd december 2002 through 24th january 2003 , a dark matter search measurement was performed . in this work , d6 and d7 showed poor signal to noise ratios due to the incomplete thermal conduction between the crystal and the thermistor and due to the high electric noises , respectively .",
    "we therefore analyzed the data obtained with the other six bolometers .",
    "we performed numerical pulse shaping to all the data using the optimal filter , or the wiener filter  @xcite .",
    "the energy of each event was determined by the peak height of a pulse after shaping .",
    "the shaped waveform @xmath12 in the fourier space is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fourier transformations of the ideal signal waveform , the measured waveform and the noise , respectively , and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "averaged signal of the gamma - ray source of @xmath17 was used as the ideal signal waveform , while the noises were obtained by gathering data while no pulse , whose height above a sufficiently low level , exists .",
    "a good lineality of this shaping method was confirmed using simulated pulses which were obtained by adding the ideal signals of known energy to the raw data . since the signals shaped from the real events have the symmetrical waveform , the asymmetrical waveform from any electric noise events or any events that were thought to have occurred within the thermistors",
    "were eliminated by the waveform analysis .",
    "the event selection efficiency was estimated by analyzing the simulated pulses in the same manner as the real data because the deficiency is mainly due to the threshold smeared by the baseline fluctuation caused by the noises . energy resolution of each detector was also estimated by a similar method , and listed in table [ detectorresponse ] .",
    "energy threshold of each detector was set at the energy in which the efficiency was equal to 0.8 , and the events above this threshold were selected as real bolometer signals .",
    "finally , those events which have associated signals in other bolometers within @xmath18 ms were discarded because the expected rate of the coincident wimp events is extremely low .",
    "calibrations were carried out using the @xmath19 and @xmath17 gamma - ray sources by the same manner as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . obtained gains for six bolometers are listed in table [ detectorresponse ] .",
    "gains and linearities were checked every four or five days , and the gains were found to be stable within @xmath20 .",
    ".detector responses of the six bolometers . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the obtained model - independent limits on @xmath5 and @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figlimitsmisd ] .",
    "we then derived the limits in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane from them . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the allowed region in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane is defined as : @xmath21 where the relative sign inside the square is determined by the sign of @xmath22 , and the small proton - neutron mass difference is ignored .",
    "obtained limits in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane for wimps with mass of 10 gev , 50 gev and 100 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ figlimitapanuk ] .",
    "the limits on the respective coupling coefficients are , for instance , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .    in fig .",
    "[ figlimitapanuk ] , we compared our results with those of our previous results @xcite and those of ukdmc experiment @xcite .",
    "though our @xmath5 limits derived from this measurement are almost the same as those derived from the previous results with the lif bolometer , we improved the limits in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane significantly .",
    "this is because has a larger expectation value of the neutron spins than .",
    "it is clearly seen that our results obtained with lif or naf detectors set limits complementary to the results obtained with nai detectors of ukdmc experiment because the spin factor of are large and the sign of @xmath22 for is opposite to those for , , and . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we did not compare our results with the sd annual modulation allowed regions shown in fig .",
    "[ figlimitssd ] @xcite because the dama group had not shown the results from and independently .    the remaining background in the energy region between 10 and 90 kev restricting the current sensitivity is supposed to be due to the uranium and thorium contamination in a crystal holder made of the ofhc copper .",
    "a use of the crystal holder with a sufficiently radio - pure material such as polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) and active shields between the crystals and their holder would help to reduce the background from the holder and the other outside materials .",
    "we have performed the dark matter search experiment at kamioka observatory with the naf bolometer . with a total exposure of 3.38 @xmath0 , we have confirmed and tightened the limits in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane obtained by the previous results with the lif bolometer . for the wimps with a mass of 50 gev",
    ", we have successfully excluded more than half of the parameter region in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane allowed by the previous results with the lif bolometer .",
    "our results set limits complementary to the results obtained by nai detectors of ukdmc experiment . since the limits from the ukdmc experiments are close to the dama s sd allowed region in ref .",
    "@xcite , we should also be able to compare our limits in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane if dama publishes relevant data to calculate these parameters .",
    "it is worth noting that this result has been obtained by a single detector with both @xmath7 , which has relatively large @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , which has the largest @xmath28 , in the detector material .",
    "we would like to thank all the staff of kamioka observatory of the institute for cosmic ray research , the university of tokyo , to whose hospitality we owe a great deal in using the facilities of the observatory .",
