    "the origin of neutrino masses is one of the most important questions in particle physics at present .",
    "various oscillation experiments have provided the mass squared differences and mixing angles of active neutrinos very precisely @xcite ; however , the mass ordering , violation of @xmath3 symmetry and fundamental property of massive neutrinos ( _ i.e. _ , majorana or dirac particles ) are still unknown .",
    "the simplest way to explain the neutrino masses is to add right - handed neutrinos to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the smallness of active neutrino masses can be explained by the large majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos thanks to the seesaw mechanism @xcite .    in the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "the mass eigenstates of neutrinos are three active neutrinos which have tiny masses observed in oscillation experiments , and heavy neutral leptons ( hnls ) which are almost identical to the right - handed states .",
    "the hnl masses are determined by majorana masses and independent from the electroweak higgs mechanism .",
    "they can take arbitrary values as long as they are sufficiently heavy to realize the seesaw mechanism .",
    "this is the reason why such hnls can cause interesting phenomena in various aspects of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "right - handed neutrinos can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the well - known scenario is the canonical leptogenesis  @xcite in which they need to be heavier than @xmath4 gev  @xcite ( or @xmath5  gev when the nonthermal production is realized  @xcite ) .",
    "the resonant leptogenesis with quasidegenerate right - handed neutrinos  @xcite can be effective with much smaller masses .",
    "moreover , if we use the flavor oscillation of right - handed neutrinos , the required mass can be as small as @xmath6 mev   @xcite .",
    "in addition , a right - handed neutrino can play an important role in astrophysics .",
    "it can be the dark matter candidate with @xmath7  kev mass  @xcite .",
    "this particle can also explain other phenomena , such as the pulsar kick  @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "further , right - handed neutrinos with @xmath8 gev may be important for the supernova explosion  @xcite .",
    "right - handed neutrinos are required by grand unified theories based on so(10 ) @xcite or larger symmetry groups .",
    "these particles can also accomplish the bottom - tau yukawa unification @xcite which is necessary for realistic grand unified theories .",
    "it has been discussed that they are favored to be lighter than @xmath9 gev due to the argument of the electroweak naturalness  @xcite .    in this way , right - handed neutrinos in the seesaw mechanism are well - motivated particles beyond the sm .",
    "the direct test of hnls is possible if they are light and their mixings are large .",
    "so far various experiments have been performed to search for hnls ( for example , see reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the noble consequence of the seesaw mechanism is that active neutrinos and hnls are majorana particles , and hence the lepton number violating processes can appear .",

    "furthermore , we should mention that these processes are complementary tests for the lepton number violation .",
    "as we will show , hnls can give a destructive contribution to the @xmath10 decay so that no signal could be observed .",
    "even in this case , the inverse @xmath10 decay could be observed since the energy scales of these processes are different .    in this paper , we shall revisit the inverse @xmath10 decay paying special attention to the following points : ( i ) we study the process in the concrete model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sm extended by @xmath14 right - handed neutrinos with the seesaw mechanism , and try to derive the theoretical prediction being specific to the model .",
    "( ii ) we take fully into account the interference effects between active neutrinos and hnls for both the @xmath10 and the inverse @xmath10 processes .",
    "( iii ) we estimate the upper bounds on the cross section depending on the number of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we use corrected cross section ( for the difference from previous studies , see the appendix ) .",
    "in addition we take into account the possibilities of the fine - tuning in parameters of the model , which have not been studied thoroughly .",
    "we find that the maximal cross section can be 0.47 fb ( 17 fb ) for the center - of - mass energy @xmath15 500 gev ( 3 tev ) avoiding the stringent constraint from the @xmath10 decay if there are three right - handed neutrinos .",
