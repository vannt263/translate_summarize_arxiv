    "<S> we consider the hamiltonian constraint formulation of classical field theories , which treats spacetime and the space of fields symmetrically , and utilizes the concept of momentum multivector . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge field is introduced to compensate for non - invariance of the hamiltonian under local transformations . </S>",
    "<S> it is a position - dependent linear mapping , which couples to the hamiltonian by acting on the momentum multivector . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate symmetries of the ensuing gauged hamiltonian , and propose a generic form of the gauge field strength . in examples </S>",
    "<S> we show how a generic gauge field can be specialized in order to realize gravitational and/or yang - mills interaction . </S>",
