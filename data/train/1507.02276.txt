    "the infrared spectrum of the nitric acid molecule , hno@xmath0 , is of astrophysical interest because of the growing interest in the study the of atmospheres of extrasolar planets . in particular , this interest is particularly linked to that of the planets with earth - like atmospheres with a high content of nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "nitric acid can be clearly observed in the earth s atmosphere from space @xcite as it has a number of features which lie in water transparency windows .",
    "its spectrum constitutes a possible biomarker as its existence is indicative of the presence of free oxygen and nitrogen , both of which lack strong spectral signatures at long wavelengths .",
    "it is also thought likely to pay an important role in nitrogen fixation on mars and other earth - like planets @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that @xmath4-ray bursts could produce large quantities of hno@xmath0 in the atmospheres of earth - like planets @xcite .",
    "nitric acid is a constituent of atmospheric ices on earth and is thought likely to be present in the ice crust of europa @xcite .",
    "its formation in interstellar ammonia ices has also been suggested @xcite , although nitric acid has yet to be observed in the interstellar medium .",
    "given the importance of hno@xmath0 in the earth s atmosphere , its infrared spectrum has been well - studied in the laboratory .",
    "however , many of these spectra remain incompletely analysed with very few assignments to transitions at wavelengths shorter than 5 @xmath1 m .",
    "this lack of assignment means that the spectra can not be used for spectral simulations at temperatures other than the one of the original experiment .",
    "spectral data on hno@xmath0 is only given in the hitran database @xcite for up to 1770 @xmath2  ( wavelengths longer than 5.6 @xmath1 m ) . at shorter wavelength the pacific northwest national laboratory ( pnnl ) database @xcite provides infrared cross sections , but again these are only valid at the temperature for which they are recorded .",
    "our results compare favourably with these sources , although this comparison shows both have their limitations @xcite .",
    "the exomol project aims at generating comprehensive line observation and modelling atmospheres of exoplanets and other hot astronomical objects such as brown dwarfs and cool stars ; its aims , scope and methodology have been summarised by @xcite .",
    "the project has provided rotation - vibration line lists for a number of polyatomic molecules such as hcn @xcite , h@xmath5s @xcite , ph@xmath0 @xcite , h@xmath5co @xcite and ch@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "none of these molecules contains more than two heavy atoms and the only pentatomic molecule considered , methane , has four hydrogens and high symmetry .",
    "it is clear that computing a comprehensive , temperature - dependent line list for hno@xmath0 represents a considerable computational challenge . to address this challenge",
    "we have developed a hybrid variational - perturbation theory procedure for computing spectra of such molecules @xcite and have tested this for room - temperature nitric acid spectra @xcite . in this work we present a comprehensive line list for nitric acid which should be valid for temperatures up to 500 k. given that nitric acid is only likely to exist in atmospheres which also contain water , we explicitly consider regions where hno@xmath0 spectra are likely to be observable in a humid atmosphere .",
    "rotation - vibration line lists were generated using the program angmol  @xcite .",
    "although angmol  is designed to solve the nuclear motion problem for polyatomic molecules using a hybrid variational - perturbation theory method , it actually provides a complete environment for performing the line list calculations .",
    "angmol  automatically generates the inputs required to drive the appropriate _",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure program , here the quantum chemistry package molpro @xcite , to provide the necessary inputs for the nuclear motion calculations ( potential energy , hessian matrix and dipole moments ) .",
    "it also automatically adjusts both the potential energy surface ( pes ) and dipole moment function ( dmf ) , which are represented as taylor - expansions about equilibrium , to reproduce observed line positions and intensities using the method of regularisation @xcite .",
    "this method uses constraints provided by the initial _ ab initio _ calculations to allow many more parameters to be varied than there are experimental data . for full details of the fits and associated surfaces see @xcite .",
    "angmol  solves a watson - like nuclear motion hamiltonian expressed in internal curvilinear vibrational coordinates in three steps .",
    "first the rotation - less ( @xmath7 ) vibrational problem is solved in a basis of morse oscillators for the stretches and harmonic oscillators for the bends by direct diagonalisation of a hamiltonian matrix for low - lying vibrational states with contributions from higher states ( basis functions ) included using perturbation theory . in the second step ,",
    "rotational problems for each vibrational state are solved using the eigenvectors from the vibrational problem and wigner rotation matrices .",
    "an eckart embedding is used to minimise coriolis interactions which are again introduced using perturbation theory .",
    "the final step computes transition intensities ; this step reduces the size of the calculation by predicting which transitions will be too weak to make a significant contribution and not calculating them . transitions whose intensity is less than @xmath8 km / mole ( @xmath9 cm / molecule . ) were neglected .",
    "integrals over the kinetic energy operator , pes and dmf are all simplified by the use of taylor expansions for the operators . here",
    "the pes and dmf were represented as fourth - order and second - order expansions , respectively .",
    "further details of the calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "= 7.0 cm    our aim was to compute a hno@xmath0 line list which is complete up to 7000 @xmath2 ( longwards of 1.42 @xmath1 m ) for temperatures up to 500 k. for this we considered energy levels up to 9000 @xmath2 and rotational states with @xmath10 up to 100 .",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to a rotational excitation of about 2130 @xmath2 .",
    "the initial vibrational ( @xmath7 ) problem was solved using vibrational basis sets with polyad number 14 . by this",
    "we mean that all combinations of functions were included when the sum of the orders of the polynomials was less than or equal to 14 .",
    "the size of the basis required increases combinatorially with polyad number @xmath11 : for hno@xmath0 , which has 9 vibrational modes , the size of the basis is given by the binomial coefficient @xmath12 which equals 817  190 for @xmath13 and 48  620 for @xmath14 .",
    "matrices constructed with polyad 9 were explicitly diagonalised once the effects of higher states were included using perturbation theory , see @xcite for further details .",
    "these calculations gave a total of 22  049 vibrational states below 9000 @xmath2 .",
    "rotationally excited states were computed based on calculation which only considered up to polyad 7 but with the vibrational band origins fixed by the larger @xmath7 calculation .",
    "this gave 9477 states lying below 7000 @xmath2 of which intensity considerations ( see @xcite for details ) showed that only 1715 need to be considered explicitly .",
    "no transition whose intensity was less than @xmath15 cm / molecule was considered .",
    "our final line list links 17  494  715 vibration - rotation energy levels with 6  722  136  109 transitions .",
    "temperature - dependent partition functions for hno@xmath0 were calculated by explicitly summing all the calculated energy levels .",
    "table  [ tab : pf ] compares our results with those used by hitran @xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good ; our results are systematically slightly larger by less than 0.2%  at low temperatures rising to 0.9 %  at 500 k. this increase is probably due to our better treatment of anharmonic effects , particularly in the large - amplitude , low - frequency oh torsional mode . a file containing the partition function 1 k steps for temperatures up to 500 k is given in supplementary material .",
    ".partition function , @xmath16 , hno@xmath0 , as a function of temperature .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]      + @xmath17 : upper state counting number ; + @xmath18 : lower state counting number ; + @xmath19 : einstein - a coefficient in s@xmath20 .",
    "as part of the exomol project we have computed a comprehensive line list for the possible biomarker nitric acid applicable to temperatures up to 500 k. to do this we have had to develop a novel methodology capable of treating the anharmonic motions of a heavy 5-atom molecule @xcite .",
    "the line lists , which contains almost 7 billion lines , can be downloaded from the cds , via ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/j/mnras/ , or http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?j/mnras/ , or from www.exomol.com .",
    "simulated spectra for a water - rich atmosphere suggest that there is real prospect of detecting trace quantities of nitric acid in the 11.25 @xmath1 m region .",
