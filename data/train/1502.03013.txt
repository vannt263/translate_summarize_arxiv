    "the planar structures with different bcs on the opposite confining walls @xcite are also encountered in nature ; for example , the long - distance dynamics between the earth and ionosphere of the very low frequency electromagnetic oscillations with wavelengths @xmath11 km is described , in the first approximation , as a propagation in the flat waveguide with one of its walls ( the ground ) being a perfect electric conductor with a reflection coefficient @xmath12 what corresponds to the bc from eq .  , while the ionosphere behaves as an ideal magnetic conductor with a reflection coefficient @xmath13 with the edge requirement governed by eq .",

    "<S> analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation for the one - dimensional quantum well with all possible permutations of the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions ( bcs ) in perpendicular to the interfaces uniform electric field @xmath0 are used for the comparative investigation of their interaction and its influence on the properties of the system . limiting cases of the weak and strong voltages </S>",
    "<S> allow an easy mathematical treatment and its clear physical explanation ; in particular , for the small @xmath0 , the perturbation theory derives for all geometries a linear dependence of the polarization on the field with the bc - dependent proportionality coefficient being positive ( negative ) for the ground ( excited ) states . </S>",
    "<S> simple two - level approximation elementary explains the negative polarizations as a result of the field - induced destructive interference of the unperturbed modes and shows that in this case the admixture of only the neighboring states plays a dominant role . </S>",
    "<S> different magnitudes of the polarization for different bcs in this regime are explained physically and confirmed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> hellmann - feynman theorem reveals a fundamental relation between the polarization and the speed of the energy change with the field . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that zero - voltage position entropies @xmath1 are bc independent and for all states but the ground neumann level ( which has @xmath2 ) are equal to @xmath3 while the momentum entropies @xmath4 depend on the edge requirements and the level . varying electric field changes position and momentum entropies in the opposite directions such that the entropic uncertainty relation is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> other physical quantities such as the bc - dependent zero - energy and zero - polarization fields are also studied both numerically and analytically . </S>",
    "<S> applications to different branches of physics , such as ocean fluid dynamics and atmospheric and metallic waveguide electrodynamics , are discussed . </S>"
