    "the transiting extrasolar planet candidate htr154 - 011 has been identified by the telescopes of the hatnet ( hat-7 , hat-8 and hat-6 , hat-9 )  see @xcite for a detailed description about the instrumentation .",
    "the reduction of the frames followed the standard frame calibration procedures , followed by star detection , astrometry and aperture photometry which was supported by various detrending algorithms .",
    "we search the light curves for box - shaped transit signals using the bls algorithm ( @xcite ) : a periodic dip was detected in the light curve of 2mass  19285935 + 4758102 . the initial `` rejection mode '' spectroscopy with cfa digital speedometer ( @xcite ) at flwo eliminated the possibility of an eclipsing binary star system .",
    "the analysis of keck hires spectra resulted the radial velocity data , stellar atmospheric parameters and the bisector information ( which ruled out a `` false positive '' hierarchical triple ) .",
    "we also carried out a partial photometry follow - up in the sloan @xmath0-band with keplercam on the flwo  1.2 m telescope .",
    "see @xcite for more details about the observational details and data reduction .",
    "the basics of the characterization of transiting extrasolar planets are the following .",
    "the period of the orbital motion can be very accurately determined because of the long timespan of the discovery ( hatnet ) observations .",
    "the mass of the planet is proportional to the amplitude of the rv curve , @xmath1 .",
    "the radius of the planet relative to the star determines the depth of the transit ( which is resulted both by the follow - up light curves and the hatnet data ) .",
    "the inclination of the orbit can be derived from the shape of the transit light curve , i.e. the impact parameter is proportional to the cosine of the inclination . to calculate the absolute mass and radius ,",
    "we need the same data or the host star too , therefore we need at least one luminosity indicator for a good stellar evolution model . because of the lack of parallax",
    ", this indicator can be @xmath2 , see @xcite .",
    "the bottleneck in this case is the partial follow - up , i.e. the shape parameters of the light curve  namely the ingress / egress length relative to the total duration  can not be derived directly to obtain a reasonable value of @xmath2 .",
    "to obtain the planetary , stellar and orbital parameters , we used all available data : ( i ) the hatnet light curves with approximately @xmath3 data points ( moderate precision with an rms of 7mmag ) .",
    "the hatnet data are affected by the period @xmath4 , epoch @xmath5 ( strongly ) , the planetary radius @xmath6 ( moderately ) , duration of the transit @xmath7 ( moderately ) , and the impact parameter @xmath8 ( slightly ) .",
    "( ii ) radial velocity data , high precision relative to the amplitude .",
    "the rv data are affected strongly by the period @xmath4 , epoch @xmath5 , semi - amplitude @xmath1 , and eccentricity @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "( iii ) the partial follow - up light curve , acquired shortly after the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the follow - up photometry data are affected by the period @xmath4 ( slightly ) , epoch @xmath5 ( strongly ) , planetary radius @xmath6 ( strongly ) , the duration of the transit @xmath11 ( strongly ) , and the impact parameter @xmath8 ( strongly ) .    because there was only a couple of periods time difference between the radial velocity observations and the partial follow - up photometry",
    ", the transit center time could have been very well extrapolated , thus the total transit duration can also be accurately obtained .",
    "there is a strong coupling between the adjustable parameters , moreover , the contribution of each parameter in each type of data are different ( see above ) , therefore to obtain a plausible set of system parameters , a joint fit should be performed , incorporating all available data simultaneously .    ( 96,100 ) ( 20,86)(0,0 ) ( 48,86)(1,0)5 ( 80,86)(0,0 ) ( 80,74)(0,-1)5 ( 20,52)(0,0 ) ( 48,68)(1,1)4 ( 53,52)(-1,0)5 ( 80,52)(0,0 ) ( 48,36)(1,-1)4 ( 20,16)(0,0 ) ( 48,16)(1,0)5 ( 80,16)(0,0 )",
    "the basic system parameters ( see previous section ) can be determined using a monte - carlo algorithm ( the method of refitting to synthetic data sets , mcmc ) , resulting an _ a posteriori _ distribution of the adjustable parameters .",
    "this method also automatically results the _ a posteriori _ distribution of derived quantities , such as @xmath2 or the inclination .",
    "the luminosity indicator is the density of the star @xmath12 which is related to the observable quantities as @xmath13 where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are observables , therefore these also have an _ a posteriori _ distribution resulted by the monte - carlo fit .",
    "the stellar evolution model ( @xcite ) results the radius of the star as the function of the density , surface temperature @xmath16 and metallicity @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath17 equation  ( [ rhostar ] ) and equation  ( [ rstar ] ) have two unknowns , @xmath18 and @xmath12 since @xmath16 and @xmath0 are also observables , known from the spectroscopy ( and also have a mc distribution from the sme analysis ) .",
    "therefore , this set of equations can be solved , which yields the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the stellar parameters .",
    "the combination of the stellar parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 with the previously fitted quantities results the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the planetary parameters in a straightforward way . a sanity check can be done by comparing the resulted stellar surface gravity ( obtained directly from @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) with the value provided by the sme . if they differ , the sme analysis has to be redone by fixing the surface gravity and the whole procedure can be done repeatedly until convergence , see flowchart on fig .  1 .",
    "we note that the complete mc way of analysis results the derived parameters independently from the form of calculations , e.g. the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the semimajor axis is exactly the same if it is calculated as @xmath20 or @xmath21^{1/3}[p/(2\\pi)]^{2/3}$ ] , altough @xmath18 or @xmath2 themselves have definitely larger individual uncertainties than the period or @xmath22 .",
    "the final stellar , planetary and orbital parameters for the hat - p-7(b ) system are summarized in table  1 .",
    ".stellar , orbital and planetary parameters of the hat - p-7(b ) system . [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the outlined method provides a straightforward way for characterizing planetary systems since ( i ) it omits any kind of intermediate values which otherwise would distort the error estimations , ( ii ) automatically results the uncertainties and correlations of the system parameters , including the stellar , planetary and orbital parameters too , ( iii ) it can utilize even the partial light curves which otherwise would not provide enough information for further steps  these partial follow - up light curves become even more important when systems with longer periods will be discovered ( i.e. the chance to observe a complete transit on a single night will be definitely smaller ) .",
    "the planet hat - p-7b is also very interesting since ( i ) it has a very high surface temperature , somewhere between @xmath23  k , depending on the heat redistribution , ( ii ) it happens to fall in the field of view of the upcoming kepler mission , yielding an opportunity for further continuous observations .",
