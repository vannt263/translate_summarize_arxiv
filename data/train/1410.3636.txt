    "the prediction of symmetry - preserved tunneling and the resulting giant tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) through crystalline mgo barrier in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs )  @xcite and its subsequent discovery  @xcite represent a major triumph of mean - field theory of electronic structure .",
    "@xcite nowadays mtj based on symmetry - preserved tunneling is used for read heads of hard disk drive and is also proposed for future data storage .",
    "the key concept is that the magnetoresistance ( mr ) ratio is determined not only by the spin polarization ( sp ) of the ferromagnetic electrodes , but also by the matching of symmetries of the bloch states tunneling through the barrier .",
    "this explains why previously the sp obtained from the band calculations did not agree with the estimated sp from tunneling experimental results when interpreted using the traditional julliere s model ,  @xcite where @xmath1 is only determined by the sp of electrodes .",
    "the inadequacy of julliere s model for spin - dependent tunneling was first pointed out by maclaren _",
    "et al _ in 1997@xcite and later detailed in the reviews .",
    "@xcite    in recent years , half metals which have full sp ( @xmath2 ) according to band calculations has draw a lot attention , especially the heusler alloys .",
    "@xcite theoretically with @xmath2 the mr ratio can be infinity",
    ". however , it is found even for the half metal full - heusler @xmath3 alloys , mr ratio is not ideal when quality of the tunneling barrier or the matching between the tunneling barrier and the electrodes is not perfect ,  @xcite while excellent mr ratio is achieved when the matching is good .",
    "@xcite thus coherent tunneling is an indispensable factor to get high mr ratio .",
    "@xcite while the sp can be directly observed by in situ spin - resovled photoemission spectroscopy ,  @xcite there seems no reliable way to verify the coherent tunneling feature .",
    "the oscillation of tmr as a function of mgo thickness was found in cases when the mr ratio is large , and thought to be related to coherent tunneling ,  @xcite but theoretical investigation indicates that it requires the presence of nonspecular scattering inside the barrier that tends to diminish symmetry filtering .",
    "@xcite here we show by conventional resistance measurement near zero bias , it might be possible to verify the symmetry selective filtering property .",
    "resistance measurement near zero bias is not new .",
    "in fact the so - called zero bias anomaly has been found for many systems since 1960 s .",
    "@xcite the decrease of mr with increasing bias was observed and has been intensively investigated as to preserve the mr ratio to higher bias is critical for practical use .",
    "the origin of the decrease of mr is usually explained in terms of noninteracting electron picture .",
    "for example , the decrease of mr with increasing bias over the range of a few hundred mv for both alo@xmath4-based  @xcite and mgo - based mtjs  @xcite was interpreted as due to inelastic spin non - conserving magnon emission  @xcite or elastic tunneling with variations of tunneling transmission and density of states .",
    "@xcite electron - electron interaction ( eei ) has largely been neglected in the study of mtjs .",
    "in addition to the slow decrease of mr over the range of a few hundred mv , for many mtj samples , both p ( when the two electrodes are magnetically aligned ) and ap ( when the electrodes are magnetically antiparallel ) states display an additional resistance cusp within a few tens of mv near zero bias that becomes sharper at lower temperatures .",
    "the mechanism behind this additional resistance peak , which we specifically refer as zero bias anomaly ( zba ) here , is a long standing puzzle .",
    "@xcite related to zba is the ` zb ' peak in the second derivative of the current - voltage curves , which is also called inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) and is frequently used to investigate inelastic tunneling processes . in iets of mtjs ,  @xcite",
    "the ` zb ' peak has been ascribed to various mechanisms , including magnon excitation ,  @xcite , magnetic impurity scattering ,  @xcite and combination of magnon scattering and eei .",
    "@xcite although some earlier works  @xcite did not distinguish between zba and magnon induced reduction of tmr over a much wider bias range , it was later shown theoretically that interface magnon scattering does not yield sharp peaks at all ,  @xcite contradicting the interpretation that the zba and the sharp peak in the iets near zero bias are due to magnon excitation .",
    "more importantly , there have been suggestions that the zba may be due to eei  @xcite but conclusive evidence is lacking .",
    "eei is just the coulomb interaction between electrons . as proposed by altshuler and aronov as early as 1979 ,  @xcite and",
    "later quoted in the textbook by abrikosov ,  @xcite the exchange interaction between electrons can cause quantum corrections to the conductivity as well as density of states .",
    "the correction due to the interference of the states has a characteristic time scale depending on the energy @xmath5 involved , and depends on the probability of two particles meeting at the same point , thus on the dimensionality of the systems .",
    "similar arguments also apply for decoherence etc and the dimension related integral @xmath6 in 3d and @xmath7 in 2d .",
    "eei induced reduction of density of states near the fermi energy has been demonstrated to be consistent with the observed zba in tunneling measurements in the 80 s .",
    "@xcite and more recently it is also been considered for cuprates and manganites .",
    "@xcite however , study of eei effect concentrated mostly outside of mtjs .",
    "the lack of the control over the tunneling wave function symmetry in conventional tunnel junctions means that there has not been any study on whether the eei effect depends on such symmetry .",
    "symmetry - preserved tunneling in mtjs provides a unique platform to answer this question and the nearly bias independent resistance in the parallel state is a big advantage for observing zba .",
    "yet one must still first settle the debate of whether the zba is caused by magnons , magnetic impurities , or eei .    in this work",
    "we first show that the zba and the ` zb ' peak in iets are indeed caused by eei , then demonstrate that the eei effect depends sensitively on symmetry filtering in the barrier layer .",
    "by performing measurements at subkelvin temperatures and with very small ac voltages , we show that the zb peaks move to as low as 0.1 mv where contribution from magnon excitation can be excluded and extra broadening due to temperature , modulation , and especially extrinsic noises is minimized .",
    "the zba is shown to follow the @xmath0 dependence with decreasing temperature and bias , consistent with the altshuler - aronov theory of tunneling in the presence of eei but inconsistent with the magnetic impurity scattering model .",
    "the slope of the @xmath0 dependence is different between the p and ap states , suggesting that bloch states with different symmetries affect the eei differently .",
    "angular dependence of the slope is also consistent with the eei mechanism and a separate effect for each incident bloch wave .",

    "the background in the ap state increases almost linearly from -100 to -40 mv , and then forms a bulge between -40 to -15 mv . from iets in fig .  1b",

    "the scaling is good for temperatures from 16 k to 4 k. however , at 0.8 k , an elevated temperature @xmath31 1.0 k needs to be assumed to overlap the data points with others at higher temperatures .",

    "this discrepancy should be due to extra electromagnetic noises which has the same broadening effect as the modulation voltage . in this sense",
    "the zba serves as an internal electron thermometer similar to the case where eei correction to conductance is used as an internal thermometer .",
    "@xcite    in the ap state , to remove the influence of the background especially at higher temperatures , @xmath29 is derived after a background subtraction as denoted by a dashed line in fig .",

    "@xcite for aluminium films with different extent of disorder  @xcite the zba can be well described by the eei induced reduction of densisty of states @xmath37 .",
    "the thermal broadening of the zba is similar to the broadening of spectral lines in tunneling spectroscopy of normal metals , which is about 5.4 @xmath38 for inelastic tunneling .",

    "besides eei , an alternative explanation for zba is magnetic impurity scattering inside barrier , presumably by diffused mn or other impurities .",
    "@xcite no mn was found in the barrier and this scenario is not consistent with the fact that after annealing zba is reduced .",
    "@xcite during the annealing process , the cofeb layer partially converts to crystalline ( 001 ) cofe with boron diffused away and this process reduces disorder ( @xmath51 is smaller ) , which leads to smaller zba following eq .  ( 1 ) . in the cases of epitaxial fe / mgo / fe mtjs  @xcite and co / mgo / co mtjs ,  @xcite the ` zb ' peak is less pronounced suggesting that slight lattice mismatch does not introduce as much disorder compared with amorphous cofeb . in addition , we found that magnetic impurity scattering does not fit data as well as eei ( cf .",

    "different modulation voltages are denoted with colors . , width=340 ]    in previous investigations of mtjs the logarithmic dependence near zero bias can not be resolved because of large ac modulation voltage ( @xmath90 about 2 - 4 mv in most cases ) and high temperature ( @xmath91 10 k ) smeared the features .",
    "@xcite the broadening effect due to ac modulation voltage is specifically shown in fig .  3 at 0.2 k where thermal broadening is minimized .",
    "within a bias range of @xmath283 mv , the conductance dip becomes deeper with lower @xmath90 , from 0.6 mv to 0.1 mv , order of magnitude smaller than used in previous cases .",
    "the second derivatives in fig .  3e , 3f show that there is no fixed ` zb ' point as presented in previous works , instead the ` zb ' point can be infinitely close to zero with reduced modulation voltage if there is no other broadening effect .",
    "in fact , for iets it is already known that the spectral broadening can be due to ac modulation voltage @xmath90 ,  @xcite and the experimental linewidth can be expressed as @xmath92 ,  @xcite with @xmath93 and @xmath94 . here below 0.8 k , the extra broadening indicated by the saturating @xmath19 as the nominal temperature goes down should be due to extrinsic electromagnetic noises ( line frequency noise etc ) .",
    "for alo@xmath4 mtjs with lower resistance , the pick up noise power is lower and @xmath19 saturates at even lower temperature around 0.4 k. as mentioned earlier , this @xmath19 can be considered as the real electronic temperature as calibrated by the quantum correction to density of states , similar to that calibrated by quantum correction to conductivity ,  @xcite and that by the coulomb blockade effect .",
    "in summary , in transport measurements of mtjs at low temperature and with low modulation voltage , logarithmic singularity near zero bias is clearly observed and can be well described by the eei theory in the weakly disordered quasi 2d limit .",
    "the commonly observed ` zb ' peak in iets is shown due to a broadening effect of this logarithmic singularity .",
    "while the slope of @xmath0 dependence is almost the same for mtjs without symmetry filtering ( amorphous barriers ) , different slopes are needed to fit the @xmath0 dependence in the p and ap states in high mr ratio mtjs , indicating that eei of bloch states with different symmetries can be distinguished .",
    "the angle dependence of the tmr and of the slope are also consistent .",
    "this finding may be useful to verify symmetry selective filtering for mtjs based on new heusler alloys , and may also open a route for probing the eei in correlated systems with electronic bands of different symmetries , e.g. , srruo@xmath95 where `` the degree and importance of correlation are still issues '' ,  @xciteand la@xmath96sr@xmath4mno@xmath95 as well as other perovskite oxides where metal - insulator transition and interface effects are still not fully understood .",
