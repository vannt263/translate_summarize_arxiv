    "the major outstanding problem in nuclear physics is to calculate properties of finite nuclei starting from the basic interactions among nucleons .",
    "this problem has two parts .",
    "first , the basic interactions among nucleons are complicated , they are not uniquely defined and there is evidence that more than just two - nucleon forces are important .",
    "second , the nuclear many - body problem is very difficult to solve .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the complex nature of the inter - nucleon interactions .",
    "both short - range and medium - range correlations among nucleons are important and for some observables long - range correlations also play a significant role .",
    "various methods have been used to solve the few - nucleon problem in the past .",
    "the faddeev method @xcite has been successfully applied to solve the three - nucleon bound - state problem for different nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite . for",
    "the solution of the four - nucleon problem one can employ yakubovsky s generalization of the faddeev formalism @xcite as done , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "alternatively , other methods have also been succesfully used , such as , the correlated hyperspherical harmonics expansion method @xcite or the green s function monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "recently , a benchmark calculation by seven different methods was performed for a four - nucleon bound state problem @xcite . however , there are few approaches that can be successfully applied to systems of more than four nucleons when realistic inter - nucleon interactions are used .",
    "apart from the coupled cluster method @xcite applicable typically to closed - shell nuclei , the green s function monte carlo method is a prominent approach capable to solve the nuclear many - body problem with realistic interactions for systems of up to @xmath0 .",
    "another method developed recently applicable to light nuclei up to @xmath1 and beyond is the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite . in this paper , an overview of this approach",
    "is given and results obtained very recently are presented . also",
    ", future developments , in particular applications to nuclear reactions , are outlined .",
    "in the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model , we consider a system of @xmath2 point - like non - relativistic nucleons that interact by realistic two- or two- plus three - nucleon ( nnn ) interactions . under the term realistic two - nucleon ( nn ) interactions we mean nn potentials that fit nucleon - nucleon phase shifts with high precision up to certain energy , typically up to 350 mev .",
    "a realistic nnn interaction includes terms related to two - pion exchanges with an intermediate delta excitation . in the ncsm ,",
    "all the nucleons are considered active , there is no inert core like in standard shell model calculations .",
    "therefore the `` no - core '' in the name of the approach .",
    "there are two other major features in addition to the employment of realistic nn or nn+nnn interactions .",
    "the first one is the use of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis truncated by a chosen maximal total ho energy of the @xmath2-nucleon system .",
    "the reason behind the choice of the ho basis is the fact that this is the only basis that allows to use single - nucleon coordinates and consequently the second - quantization representation without violating the translational invariance of the system .",
    "the powerful techniques based on the second quantization and developed for standard shell model calculations can then be utilized .",
    "therefore the `` shell model '' in the name of the approach . as a downside",
    ", one has to face the consequences of the incorrect asymptotic behavior of the ho basis .",
    "the second feature comes as a consequence of the basis truncation . in order to speed up convergence with the basis enlargement",
    ", we construct an effective interaction from the original realistic nn or nn+nnn potentials by means of a unitary transformation .",
    "the effective interaction depends on the basis truncation and by construction becomes the original realistic nn or nn+nnn interaction as the size of the basis approaches infinity . in principle",
    ", one can also perform calculations with the unmodified , `` bare '' , original interactions .",
    "such calculations are then variational with the ho frequency and the basis truncation parameter as variational parameters .",
    "the starting hamiltonian of the _ ab initio _ ncsm is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nucleon mass , @xmath5 the nn interaction , @xmath6 the three - nucleon interaction . in the ncsm",
    ", we employ a large but finite ho basis . due to properties of the realistic nuclear interaction in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , we must derive an effective interaction appropriate for the basis truncation . to facilitate the derivation of the effective interaction , we modify the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) by adding to it the center - of - mass ( cm ) ho hamiltonian @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the effect of the ho cm hamiltonian will later be subtracted out in the final many - body calculation . due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) the ho cm hamiltonian has in fact no effect on the intrinsic properties of the system .",
    "the modified hamiltonian can be cast into the form @xmath10",

    "< k}^a v_{{\\rm nnn } , ijk } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the _ ab initio _ ncsm , we use a ho basis .",
    "a single - nucleon ho wave function can be written as @xmath11 with @xmath12 the radial ho wave function and @xmath13 the ho length parameter related to the ho frequency @xmath14 as @xmath15 , with @xmath4 the nucleon mass .",
    "the ho length parameter @xmath13 is often dropped in @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the following text to simplify notation .",
    "the ho wave functions have important transformation properties that we utilize frequently .",
    "let us consider two particles with different masses of ratio @xmath18 moving in a ho well .",
    "their relative and center - of - mass coordinates can be defined by an orthogonal transformation @xmath19 where all the vectors in ( [ coord_tr ] ) and ( 5 ) are defined as products of square root of the respective mass and the position vector : @xmath20 .",
    "the product of the single - particle ho wave functions can then be expressed as a linear combination of the relative - coordinate ho wave function and the cm coordinate ho wave function : @xmath21^{(k)}_k=\\sum_{nlnl}\\langle nl nl k     with @xmath22 a generalized ho bracket that can be evaluated according to the algorithm in , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the nn and nnn interactions depend on relative coordinates and/or momenta , the natural coordinates in the nuclear problem are the relative , or jacobi , coordinates .",
    "we work in the isospin formalism and consider nucleons with the mass @xmath4 . a generalization to the proton - neutron formalism with unequal masses for the proton and",

    "as nucleons are fermions , we need to construct an antisymmetrized basis . here",
    "we illustrate how to do this for the simplest case of three nucleons .",
    "one starts by introducing a ho basis that depends on jacobi coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 , defined in eqs .",

    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the total angular momentum and the total isospin , respectively .",
    "note that the basis ( [ hobas ] ) is antisymmetrized with respect to the exchanges of nucleons 1 and 2 , as the two - nucleon channel quantum numbers are restricted by the condition @xmath36 .",
    "it is not , however , antisymmetrized with respect to the exchanges of nucleons @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in order to construct a completely antisymmetrized basis",
    ", one needs to obtain eigenvectors of the antisymmetrizer @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cyclic and the anti - cyclic permutation operators , respectively .",
    "the antisymmetrizer @xmath42 is a projector satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "when diagonalized in the basis ( [ hobas ] ) , its eigenvectors span two eigenspaces .",
    "one , corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 , is formed by physical , completely antisymmetrized states and the other , corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 , is formed by spurious states .",
    "there are about twice as many spurious states as the physical ones @xcite .    due to the antisymmetry with respect to the exchanges @xmath44 ,",
    "the matrix elements in the basis ( [ hobas ] ) of the antisymmetrizer @xmath42 can be evaluated simply as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the transposition operator corresponding to the exchange of nucleons 2 and 3 .",
    "its matrix element can be evaluated in a straightforward way , e.g. , @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ; and @xmath49 ) can be derived by examining the action of @xmath46 on the basis states ( [ hobas ] ) . that operator changes the state @xmath50 to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 are defined as @xmath53 but with the single - nucleon indexes 2 and 3 exchanged .",
    "the primed jacobi coordinates can be expressed as an orthogonal transformation of the unprimed ones , see eq .",
    "( [ hotransform ] ) .",
    "consequently , the ho wave functions depending on the primed jacobi coordinates can be expressed as an orthogonal transformation of the original ho wave functions .",
    "elements of the transformation are the generalized ho brackets for two particles with the mass ratio @xmath54 , with @xmath54 determined from the orthogonal transformation of the coordinates , see eq .",
    "( [ coord_tr ] ) .    the resulting antisymmetrized states can be classified and expanded in terms of the original basis ( [ hobas ] ) as follows @xmath55 and where we introduced an additional quantum number @xmath56 that distinguishes states with the same set of quantum numbers @xmath57 , e.g. , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the total number of antisymmetrized states for a given @xmath57 .",
    "the symbol @xmath60 is a coefficient of fractional parentage .",
    "a generalization to systems of more than three nucleons can be done as shown e.g. in ref .",
    "it is obvious , however , that as we increase the number of nucleons , the antisymmetrization becomes more and more involved .",
    "consequently , in the standard shell model calculations one utilizes antisymmetrized wave functions constructed in a straightforward way as slater determinants of single - nucleon wave functions depending on single - nucleon coordinates @xmath61 .",
    "it follows from the transformations ( [ hotransform ] ) that a use of a slater determinant basis constructed from single nucleon ho wave functions such as @xmath62 results in eigenstates of a translationally invariant hamiltonian that factorize as products of a wave function depending on relative coordinates and a wave function depending on the cm coordinates .",
    "this is true as long as the basis truncation is done by a chosen maximum of the sum of all ho excitations , i.e. : @xmath63 . in eq .",
    "( [ howavesp ] ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are spin and isospin coordinates of the nucleon .",
    "the physical eigenstates of an translationally invariant hamiltonian can then be selected as eigenstates with the cm in the @xmath66 state : @xmath67 , the jacobi coordinate basis is more efficient as one can perform the antisymmetrization easily .",
    "the cm degrees of freedom can be explicitly removed and a coupled @xmath68 basis can be utilized with matrix dimensions of the order of thousands . for systems with @xmath69 , it is in general more efficient to use the slater determinant ho basis .",
    "in fact , we use so - called m - scheme basis with conserved quantum numbers @xmath70 , parity @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the antisymmetrization is trivial , but the dimensions can be huge as the cm degrees of freedom are present and no @xmath73 coupling is considered .",
    "the advantage is the possibility to utilize the powerful second quantization technique , shell model codes , transition density codes and so on .",
    "as mentioned above , the model space truncation is always done using the condition @xmath63 .",
    "often , instead of @xmath74 we introduce the parameter @xmath75 that measures the maximal allowed ho excitation energy above the unperturbed ground state . for @xmath76 systems @xmath77 . for the @xmath78-shell nuclei",
    "they differ , e.g. for @xmath79li , @xmath80 , for @xmath81c , @xmath82 etc .      in the _",
    "ab initio _ ncsm calculations we use a truncated ho basis as discussed in previous sections .",
    "the inter - nucleon interactions act , however , in the full space . in order to obtain meaningful results in the truncated space , or model space ,",
    "the inter - nucleon interactions needs to be renormalized .",
    "we need to construct an effective hamiltonian with the inter - nucleon interactions replaced by effective interactions . by meaningful results we understand results as close as possible to the full space exact results for a subset of eigenstates .",
    "mathematically we can construct an effective hamiltonian that exactly reproduces the full space results for a subset of eigenstates .",
    "in practice , we can not in general construct this exact effective hamiltonian for the @xmath2-nucleon problem we want to solve .",
    "however , we can construct an effective hamiltonian that is exact for a two - nucleon system or for a three - nucleon system or even for a four - nucleon system .",
    "the corresponding effective interactions can then be used in the @xmath2-nucleon calculations .",
    "their use in general improves the convergence of the problem to the exact full space result with the increase of the basis size . by construction",
    ", these effective interactions converge to the full - space inter - nucleon interactions therefore guaranteeing convergence to exact solution when the basis size approaches the infinite full space .    in our approach",
    "we employ the so - called lee - suzuki similarity transformation method @xcite , which yields a starting - energy independent hermitian effective interaction .",
    "we first recapitulate general formulation and basic results of this method . applications of this method for computation of two- or three - body effective interactions are described afterwards .",

    "the three - nucleon matrix element of the regulated term is then obtained in the form @xmath206 with a new function @xmath207 and customary abbreviation @xmath208 .",
