    "hair cells of the inner ear detect mechanical stimuli by deflections of the hair bundle , which open tension - gated transduction channels in the cell membrane to admit cations from the endolymph .",
    "the current is mostly composed of potassium ions , but also includes a small quantity of calcium ions @xcite .",
    "experiments in which hair bundles are held at a fixed deflection , using a microneedle , have revealed two adaptation processes that modify the transduction current , causing it to decline with time @xcite .",
    "the first , which can occur on a sub - millisecond time scale , is dependent on the concentration of @xmath0  in the endolymph .",
    "it is believed to be a consequence of @xmath0  entering the hair bundle and binding to the transduction channels , making them more likely to close .",
    "the second , which takes up to hundreds of milliseconds , is also dependent on @xmath0  concentration , and is thought to be caused by the movement of adaptation motors attached to the transduction channels , which adjusts the tension that gates them .",
    "a number of experiments have demonstrated that hair bundles can generate active oscillations , both in preparations of dissected tissue @xcite and _ in vivo _",
    "it has been shown on theoretical grounds that the active oscillatory mechanism can provide an explanation for the high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity of auditory receptors @xcite if the system is poised on the verge of spontaneous oscillation .",
    "this critical point corresponds to a hopf bifurcation of the active dynamical system .",
    "it has been suggested that a feedback mechanism operates to maintain the system at the critical point where it is most sensitive , leading to the concept of _ self - tuned critical oscillations_. @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide a coherent model for the active amplifier in hair cells , based on the combined action of the two known adaptation mechanisms . in our model",
    "the interaction of @xmath0  ions with the transduction channels generates an oscillatory instability of the hair bundle . working on a slower time scale ,",
    "the adaptation motors act to tune this dynamical system to the critical point , at which it just begins to oscillate .",
    "the two adaptation mechanisms together constitute a dynamical system displaying a _ self - tuned hopf bifurcation _",
    "poised at the oscillatory instability , the hair bundle is especially responsive to faint sounds .",
    "our model differs from two published models of hair - bundle oscillations .",
    "choe , magnasco and hudspeth ( @xcite ) have previously proposed that channel reclosure induced by @xmath0  ions can generate a hopf instability . in their scheme",
    "the oscillation frequency is controlled by the kinetics of the transduction channel . in our model",
    "the frequency of spontaneous oscillations is governed , instead , by the architecture of the bundle and by the rate at which the calcium concentration equilibrates .",
    "this is more consistent with the finding that the rate at which the transduction channel switches is faster than the characteristic frequency , especially in low - frequency hair cells @xcite .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the hopf instability is generated by motor proteins in the kinocilium , and that regulation to the critical point is accomplished by a feedback mechanism involving calcium .",
    "their model is thus the converse of that presented here , but shares the underlying feature of self - tuned criticality .",
    "the current model accords better with the observation that some hair bundles lack a kinocilium and others do not change their behavior significantly when the kinocilium is interfered with @xcite .",
    "in addition to demonstrating that the two adaptation processes can combine to provide an active amplifier , we derive expressions that indicate how properties like the characteristic frequency of critical oscillations , and the sensitivity of response to sound waves , depend on parameters like the bundle height and the number of stereocilia .",
    "we also investigate how the dynamics can be modified if conditions are perturbed , and show that the bundle can exhibit slow relaxation oscillations which differ in many aspects from critical oscillations , but resemble the active movements recently observed in experiments on hair cells from the frog sacculus @xcite .",

    "the presence of @xmath0  therefore does not directly cause channel re - closure , but it does stabilize the closed state and delay re - opening.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( b )  binds to the channel when it is already in a closed state .",
    "the presence of @xmath0  therefore does not directly cause channel re - closure , but it does stabilize the closed state and delay re - opening.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    hair bundles in different species , or from hair cells with different characteristic frequencies within the same organ of thte internal ear of a particular animal , can vary in shape and size , and also in the way that they are coupled to external mechanical vibrations @xcite .",
    "generally , one can distinguish between free - standing hair bundles ( e.g. some reptiles , mammalian inner hair cells ) and those who tips are embedded in an accessory structure ( e.g. other reptiles , birds , amphibial saccular hair cells ) . in experiments on dissected tissue , the accessory structure",
    "is usually removed . in this paper",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the simplest situation of a free - standing hair bundle .",
    "a bundle that is directly connected to the tectorial membrane could be described in a similar fashion , but using modified expressions for the stiffness , the friction and the coupling to the external signal .",
    "the hair bundle ( see fig .  [ fig_bundle]a ) is composed of @xmath1 stereocilia which slope up against each other , the longest of which has length @xmath2 .",
    "typically , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are inversely related , with the range @xmath3 @xcite corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "each stereocilium is joined to the next by an elastic filament  the tip link  which connects to a tension - gated transduction channel in the cell membrane ( @xcite , @xcite ; for a review see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the tension in the tip link can be adjusted by a group of myosin motors , which are connected to the transduction channel and move it along the actin filaments inside the stereocilium @xcite .    to set up a coordinate system ,",
    "we consider first a free - standing bundle . within a stereocilium",
    ", we label the location at which the stereocilium touches its shorter neighbor * o*. the position of the channel ( and the attached motors ) relative to * o * is denoted by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the length of a tip link at rest and @xmath7 its extension under tension .",
    "when the tip of the bundle is deflected through a lateral displacement @xmath8 , each stereocilium pivots at its base and adjacent stereocilia are sheared by a displacement @xmath9 . the geometric factor @xmath10",
    "may be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between the roots of neighboring stereocilia @xcite .",
    "we label the new location at which the stereocilium touches its shorter neighbor * o*. the position of the channel relative to * o * is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "it follows that @xmath14    the movement of the bundle is countered by an elastic restoring force , which has two contributions .",
    "first , the deformation of the stereocilia at their base provides an effective bundle stiffness @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the pivotal stiffness of a stereocilium .",
    "the measured value @xmath17 @xcite indicates that @xmath18 varies from @xmath19 for tall bundles to @xmath20 for short ones .",
    "the second contribution , which scales in the same way with bundle size and is of similar magnitude , comes from the tension @xmath21 in the tip links .",
    "movement of the bundle is also resisted by the viscous drag of the surrounding fluid which leads to a friction coefficient @xmath22 for tall bundles , where @xmath23 is the viscosity of the endolymph .",
    "thus , when an external force @xmath24 is applied to the tip of the bundle , its equation of motion is @xmath25 ( throughout the paper we use the convention @xmath26 ) . here",
    ", we have written @xmath27 , anticipating that the tension in the tip links depends on the local intracellular @xmath0  concentration @xmath28 , as well as varying with the position @xmath29 . for future reference",
    ", we note that the mechanical relaxation time of the hair bundle , @xmath30 , varies from a few microseconds to tens of milliseconds .",
    "the mechanically - gated transduction channel is the central component of the model , since we postulate that hair bundle oscillations are driven by the force that is generated as the channels change conformation stochastically , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that transmembrane channel proteins can exist in a number of discrete states , some of which are closed and some open . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig_bundle]b , we additionally suppose that the channel protein incorporates a lever arm which amplifies the small structural changes that occur when the channel switches state , and thereby appreciably modifies the tension in the adjoining tip link @xcite .",
    "if @xmath31 is the probability that the channel is in state @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the position of the lever arm in that state , then the average tension may be written @xmath34 . here",
    ", @xmath35 is the elastic constant of the tip link ( or possibly that of a more compliant element in series with it @xcite ) , whose value obtained from micromechanical measurements is @xmath36 @xcite . in the steady state",
    "the probabilities @xmath37 are given by the boltzmann factors @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the free energy of state @xmath32 .",
    "measurements of the transduction current as a function of bundle displacements in the frog s sacculus are well fitted with a three - state model of the channel @xcite , with two closed states ( @xmath40 ) and one open state ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the fit indicates that the lever - arm movement is about 5 times greater for the transition @xmath42 than for the transition @xmath43 , while more recent data @xcite suggests that the total movement is about 8 nm .",
    "we therefore assign the lever arm displacements @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the free energies @xmath39 depend on the local @xmath0  concentration @xmath28 within the stereocilia @xcite , which is strongly influenced by the entry of @xmath0  ions through the channel @xcite .",
    "a higher @xmath0  concentration favors closure of the channel , thereby providing a negative feedback .",
    "we model this dependence empirically , according to experimental observations @xcite , as an effective shift in the channel gating point proportional to the logarithm of the @xmath0  concentration @xmath47 where the constant @xmath48 has an empirical value of about @xmath49 in the bullfrog s sacculus @xcite and @xmath50 is the @xmath0  concentration in the free - standing bundle . one possible interpretation of this functional form , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig_bundle]b , is that @xmath0  binds to state c2 , causing it to switch to state c1 and thereby stabilizing the closed state .",
    "we emphasize that our model does not rely on the channel having three states .",
    "a two - state channel ( eliminating state c2 ) would give substantially similar results .",
    "an important aspect of our model is that we assume that the channel kinetics are rapid compared to the bundle oscillations and the calcium dynamics .",
    "the evidence for this assumption comes , for instance , from saccular hair cells that detect frequencies up to @xmath51 and have channel opening times around @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we can therefore consider the different channel states to be thermally equilibrated with one another , and chemically equilibrated with the @xmath0  ions .",
    "then we can split the tip link tension @xmath21 into two components : @xmath53 , the passive elastic force that the tip link would contribute in the absence of the transduction channel ; and @xmath54 , the active contribution arising from the channel switching states , also called _ gating force _ :",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "a relationship between the gating force and the channel opening probability , which holds in any model with a single open state , reads @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the calcium concentration in a stereocilium is influenced by a number of processes . as well as the influx of @xmath0  through the transduction channel , there is an outflux due to calcium pumps .",
    "the ions also diffuse freely , or in association with mobile buffers , and can additionally bind to fixed buffers .",
    "a detailed model of this dynamics was developed by @xcite , but for our purposes it suffices to use a simplified linearized model in which the @xmath0  concentration on the inner side of the channel obeys the equation @xmath58 \\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath59 is the steady - state concentration which would occur if the channel were blocked , originating from diffusion from other parts of the cell ; @xmath60 is the maximal additional contribution from influx through an open transduction channel , and is of order @xmath61 .",
    "the relaxation rate of calcium concentration fluctuations , @xmath62 , is an important parameter in our model .",
    "we expect the relaxation time @xmath63 to be of the order of milliseconds , corresponding to the measured fast adaptation time @xcite .",
    "note that the slow @xmath0  kinetics ( along with fast channel switching ) is a key difference between our model and that of @xcite , where the converse situation is assumed .",
    "the slow @xmath0  dynamics might seem at odds with the fact that the binding sites on the channel are reached by the incoming ions very quickly .",
    "but in our model , the channel is in state c2 when @xmath0  binds , i.e. it is closed ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bundle]b ) .",
    "it therefore typically senses a concentration which is determined by diffusion within a larger volume , and which also depends on the interaction of @xmath0  with fixed and mobile buffers . because a @xmath0  ion binds to one of the buffers in less than @xmath64 @xcite , the concentration of free @xmath0  equilibrates with that bound to the buffers within a few microseconds of channel closure o@xmath65c2 .",
    "the time - scale of @xmath0  relaxation is therefore determined by buffering , diffusion to distant parts of the stereocilium and the activity of @xmath0  pumps .",
    "indeed , the influence of buffers on the fast adaptation process has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "experiments in which a vertebrate hair bundle is suddenly displaced @xcite show a slow adaptation of the channel current , on the scale of tens of milliseconds . the transduction channel is attached to the actin cortex within a stereocilium by a number of myosin 1c ( formerly i@xmath66 ) motors .",
    "there is strong evidence that these molecular motors mediate slow adapatation @xcite , presumably by maintaining the proper tenstion in the tip link @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the motors have a linear force - velocity relation , so that @xmath67 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the number of motors bound to the actin , @xmath69 is the stall force of an individual motor and @xmath70 is its zero - load velocity .",
    "we take values typical for a motor protein , @xmath71 and @xmath72 and suppose that there are @xmath73 motors per channel ( experimental data suggest @xmath74 @xcite ) .",
    "calcium has been shown to influence the action of the adaptation motor @xcite , possibly by increasing its rate of detachment from actin .",
    "the number of bound motors is therefore not constant , but obeys the dynamical equation @xmath75 \\;.\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the myosin binding rate and @xmath77 is a function describing the dependence of the detachment rate on the @xmath0  concentration .",
    "in order to examine the dynamical stability of the hair bundle in the absence of a driving force , @xmath78 , we make use of the fact that the adaptation motors operate on a slower time scale than both the mechanical relaxation of the bundle and the relaxation of the calcium concentration",
    ". we can therefore neglect their motion for now , and suppose that @xmath7 is fixed .",
