    "study of the spectrum of isospin @xmath1 @xmath22 excited states is one of the most important issues in hadronic physics and is attracting much attention because it is the most experimentally accessible system composed of three identical valence quarks .",

    ", there are still many theoretical predictions of  missing @xmath25 states \" , within the constituent quark  @xcite or chiral unitary  @xcite approaches , which have so far not been observed . searching for these  missing @xmath25 states \" from other production processes is necessary  @xcite . a possible new excellent source for studying these @xmath25 resonance comprises the @xmath26 and @xmath27 reactions , which have a special advantage since there is no contributions from isospin @xmath28 nucleon resonances because of the isospin and charge conservations .",
    "in addition , those reactions require the creation of an @xmath29 quark pair .",
    "thus , a thorough and dedicated study of the strangeness production mechanism in those reactions has the potential to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction among strange hadrons and also the nature of the @xmath25 resonances .    in analogy to the @xmath30 as first - excited state of the nucleon ,",
    "the @xmath4 is the first - excited state of the @xmath31 hyperon and has a spin - parity of @xmath32 and isospin 1 .",
    "this resonance is considered as a standard quark triplet and cataloged in the baryon decuplet , but its vicinity to the @xmath33 state in the mass spectrum correlates the study and the understanding of the two resonances . on the other hand , a @xmath34 state , @xmath35 ( spin - parity @xmath36 ) with mass about @xmath37 mev , was predicted in the framework of the diquark - diquark - antiquark picture  @xcite .",
    "this new state will make effects in the production of @xmath4 and then the analysis of the @xmath4 resonance suffers from the overlapping mass distributions and the common @xmath38 decay mode .    there were pioneering measurements in the 1970s , the first @xmath39 cross sections in the high energy region , with beam momentum p@xmath40 = 6 gev , were reported in ref .",
    "recently , this reaction was examined at @xmath41 gev beam energy by hades collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the results of angular distributions of the @xmath21 in different reference frame show that there could be contribution from an intermediate @xmath25 resonance via the decay of @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the study of the possible role played by @xmath25 resonances in the available new data from the hades collaboration is timely and could shed light on the complicated dynamics that governs the spectrum of these @xmath25 states .",

    ", we also study possible contributions from @xmath25 resonances in the @xmath13-channel . based on the results obtained from @xmath6 reaction , we tend to study the role of @xmath25 resonances in the @xmath0 reaction with the assumption that the production mechanism is due to the @xmath48-meson exchange with the aim of describing the new experimental data reported by hades .",
    "unfortunately , the information about the strong coupling of @xmath49 is scarce  @xcite .",
