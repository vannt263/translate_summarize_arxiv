    "doped crystalline semiconductors are ideal solids to probe the effects of both disorder and electron - electron interaction on the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in disordered electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "important information about the mit is provided by the critical exponent @xmath3 for the zero - temperature conductivity @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dopant concentration and @xmath7 is the critical concentration for the mit , and @xmath8 has been found in a number of nominally uncompensated semiconductors including our @xmath0ge : ga  @xcite .    according to the theories of the mit ,",
    "the value of the critical exponents does not depend on the details of the system , but depends only on the universality class to which the system belongs . in this sense ,",
    "the application of a magnetic field is important because the motion of carriers loses its time - reversal symmetry in magnetic fields , and the universality class changes . in our earlier work",
    ", we reported that a different exponent @xmath9 is obtained in magnetic fields  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath10 characterizes the magnetic - field - induced mit : @xmath11 since this result is based solely on the metallic samples , in this work we perform a finite - temperature scaling analysis  @xcite which uses the data on the both sides of the transition .",
    "moreover , we investigate the temperature dependence of the conductivity on the insulating side in the context of variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) conduction .",
    "all the samples were prepared by neutron - transmutation - doping ( ntd ) of isotopically enriched @xmath0ge single crystals .",
    "the ntd method assures a homogeneous ga acceptor distribution which is a crucial condition for experimental studies of the mit  @xcite .",
    "the electrical conductivity was measured at low temperatures between 0.05 and 0.5  k.",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : finitet ] that @xmath12 ( ref .",
    "[ wat99 ] ) yields an excellent finite - temperature scaling plot @xmath13 where @xmath14 is equivalent to @xmath10 .",
    "here we employ @xmath15 obtained by fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmit ] ) .",
    "the temperature variation of the conductivity is proportional to @xmath16 even around the critical point in magnetic fields  @xcite , leading to @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 , i.e. , none of these parameters are used as a fitting parameter .",

    "the temperature dependence of the conductivity on the insulating side of the mit is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : t0 ] . )    note that the condition @xmath33 is required for the es theory to be valid , i.e. , @xmath28 has to be evaluated only from the data obtained at temperatures low enough to satisfy this condition . since @xmath34 and both @xmath26 and the dielectric constant @xmath35 diverge at @xmath7 , @xmath36",
    "here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath41 , which was predicted theoretically  @xcite , has been obtained at @xmath19 for the present system by measuring magnetoresistance in weak fields ( @xmath42 )  @xcite . assuming the relation @xmath43 , @xmath44 is obtained for @xmath45 , and hence , the wegner relation @xmath46",
    "@xcite holds in magnetic fields .",
    "the critical exponent of the zero - temperature conductivity for the metal - insulator transition of doped semiconductors in magnetic fields is confirmed to be close to unity .",
