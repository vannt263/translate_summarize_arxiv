    "the cf model@xcite belongs to the family of network models first proposed in ref .   for the description of the ( conventional ) quantum hall effect .",
    "the structure of the network in the clean limit is shown in fig .",
    "the model describes quantum dynamics of noninteracting particles living on the directed links of a square network .",
    "if ( as here ) the wave function on a link has one component , the state of the system as a whole is represented by an @xmath33-component vector , where @xmath33 is the number of links .",
    "the time evolution is characterized by a @xmath34 unitary matrix @xmath35 , which in the absence of disorder is governed by a single parameter , @xmath36 . at every node of the network",
    "the particle turns right or left with a probability amplitude @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the amplitude signs are shown in fig .  [ f2 ] and ensure unitarity of the evolution operator @xmath35.@xcite note that each plaquette of the network carries half a flux quantum so that particles pick up a phase factor @xmath39 when moving around it .     and",

    "adding disorder by inserting a vortex pair corresponds to flipping the signs of either a pair of s or a pair of c that are associated with a given node . ]    in the absence of disorder , the parameter @xmath15 is the same for all the nodes ; then the network is a fermionic representation of the clean ising model and @xmath35 can be diagonalized by fourier transform . near the critical point and for small wave vectors @xmath41 , the spectrum has a dirac form @xmath42 .",
    "the gap @xmath43 vanishes at the critical point @xmath44 where the dos is linear in energy : @xmath45 .",
    "one can think of the evolution @xmath35 as being generated by a hamiltonian .",
    "taking @xmath46 , the symmetry condition for class d , that @xmath12 is purely imaginary , implies that @xmath35 is real .",
    "hence , within symmetry class d , disorder can be introduced into the model by allowing for node - to - node variation of the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways . a disorder weak in the perturbative sense of refs .   and",
    "can be realized by drawing @xmath15 for every node from a distribution with a width @xmath47 that is small compared to the mean value . in contrast , in the cf model , disorder is introduced as isolated defects by making the change @xmath48 or @xmath49 , for a subset of nodes randomly distributed with a concentration @xmath17",
    ". this amounts to flipping signs of either both @xmath50 or both @xmath51 associated with such a node .",
    "this procedure can be viewed as the insertion of two additional half - flux lines into two plaquettes adjacent to the node and belonging to the same sublattice , see fig .",
    "note that the vortex pair appears with equal probability on the c- or s - sublattice .",
    "it is this feature that distinguishes the cf model from the rbim,@xcite which is obtained if all the additional vortices are placed on the same sublattice .",
    "our numerical analysis centers on the matrix @xmath35 for a system with a torus geometry of size @xmath52 . since @xmath35 is unitary , its @xmath53 eigenvalues @xmath54 lie on the unit circle , defining the energies @xmath55 . for a given realization of disorder ,",

    ", the conductance of the metal increases logarithmically , @xmath72 , and hence diverges in the limit @xmath73 , so that the perturbative rg is justified . a similar analysis yields the rg equation for the second coupling constant @xmath74",

    "( [ e1 ] ) for the dos .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) , one sees that the logarithmic increase in the conductance is driven by the logarithmically divergent density of states , while the diffusion constant @xmath24 remains nonsingular to this order .",

    "the data exhibit a logarithmic increase of the dos over almost three decades in @xmath5 for the larger system size , @xmath60 .",
    "we stress that the increase continues to be of logarithmic form even though the renormalized dos at small energies becomes much larger than its bare ( large-@xmath5 ) value @xmath77 .",

    "these are rmt oscillations due to finite system size and serve as another indication of the fact that we are dealing with a metallic phase . to demonstrate the rmt origin of these oscillations , we replot these parts of dos curves , rescaling the energy to the mean level spacing @xmath79 at lowest energy for the corresponding system size .",

    "[ f4 ] , the curve obtained agrees nicely with the rmt prediction , @xmath86,\\ ] ] up to @xmath87-@xmath88 ; for larger energies , the oscillations are strongly suppressed .",
    "this is fully consistent with the exponential vanishing of the rmt oscillations beyond the thouless energy ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . with increasing system size ,",
    "the ratio @xmath89 increases ( though only logarithmically ) , so that the rmt range includes progressively more oscillation periods .",

    "[ f3 ] the low - energy dos for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; the latter point is close to the expected boundary of the metallic phase , see fig .",
    "it is seen that when the system approaches the phase boundary , the logarithmic increase of the dos disappears and the rmt oscillations get damped .",
    "having explored the metallic phase , we now turn to the phases with localized states . fixing the interplaquette coupling @xmath15 at a value somewhat different from @xmath28 and decreasing the concentration @xmath17 of vortex defects , we expect ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) that the system undergoes a transition at a critical value @xmath90 ( which is of the order @xmath91 ) and enters the insulator or quantum hall conductor . in both phases ,",

    "the low - energy singular peak , whose magnitude increases logarithmically with the system size ( as studied in sec .",

    "since this logarithmic singularity was a key signature of the thermal - metal phase , its absence signals the breakdown of the metallic behavior and , hence , the emergence of a localized phase .     for disorder values @xmath94 , 0.08 , 0.04 , and 0.02 and for two system sizes @xmath95 at fixed interplaquette coupling @xmath96 .",
    "the dos diverges logarithmically as @xmath1 in the metallic phase ( @xmath94 ) and remains finite in the localized phase ( other values of @xmath17 ) .",

    "no peak at @xmath99 is detected ; @xmath100 is a constant independent of @xmath71 , indicating that the system is in the insulating phase .",
    "statistical noise in the lower inset is more pronounced than in the upper one due to the smallness of the dos . ]    for the localized phases , our main finding is that the dos has a nonzero value at @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to ask how this behavior connects with the value @xmath101 expected from ref .",
    "( see eq .",
    "[ e2 ] above ) at the plateau transition .",
    "consider the dos for @xmath15 close to the critical value @xmath102 , so that the localization length @xmath103 is large .",
    "the behavior of dos can then be understood by using the dirac - fermion rg presented in appendix [ s - a1 ] .",
    "specifically , for energies that are not too small , behavior will be the same as at criticality , eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "however , for smallest energies , it is the localization length @xmath103 ( rather than @xmath5 ) that will terminate the rg process . in this sense",
    ", the role of @xmath103 is fully analogous to that of finite system size @xmath71 at criticality .",
    "this implies ( see appendix  [ s - a1 ] ) that @xmath0 saturates at the value @xmath104 where @xmath25 is the ultraviolet cutoff length .",
    "the energy @xmath105 at which the saturation takes place is @xmath106 the low - energy saturation of the dos in the localized phases which we observe in our numerical simulations is fully consistent with these analytical predictions .    before closing this subsection , we comment briefly on the regions of localized phases where the interplaquette coupling is very weak ( @xmath107 close to zero or to unity ) .",
    "as shown recently,@xcite in this situation the dos of the rbim acquires a nonuniversal power - law singularity , @xmath108 with @xmath109 associated with griffiths strings.@xcite we expect that the same mechanism should be operative in the cho - fisher model as well .",

    "<S> we investigate numerically the quasiparticle density of states @xmath0 for a two - dimensional , disordered superconductor in which both time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry are broken . as a generic single - particle description of this class of systems ( symmetry class d ) </S>",
    "<S> , we use the cho - fisher version of the network model . </S>",
    "<S> this has three phases : a thermal insulator , a thermal metal , and a quantized thermal hall conductor . in the thermal metal </S>",
    "<S> , we find a logarithmic divergence in @xmath0 as @xmath1 , as predicted from sigma model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size effects lead to superimposed oscillations , as expected from random matrix theory . in the thermal insulator and quantized thermal hall conductor , we find that @xmath0 is finite at @xmath2 . at the plateau transition between these phases </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 decreases toward zero as @xmath3 is reduced , in line with the result @xmath4 introduction ------------    the study of anderson transitions  disorder - driven transitions in systems of noninteracting fermions  has a long history in condensed - matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry is a guide to understanding both mesoscopic behavior in each phase and critical behavior at a transition . according to the symmetry classification inherited from random - matrix theory , in a conventional situation three wigner - dyson symmetry classes  orthogonal </S>",
    "<S> , unitary and symplectic  can be distinguished , depending on whether or not the hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal and spin rotation ( see refs . for reviews ) . above a lower critical dimension , systems in each symmetry class can have a transition between insulating and metallic phases . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in two - dimensional systems without symmetry under time - reversal or parity , a second type of insulating phase is possible , with edge states and a quantized hall conductance , and there can be a plateau transition between the insulator and the quantized hall conductor . </S>",
    "<S> long - distance properties of these systems are described by nonlinear sigma models . within this framework </S>",
    "<S> , quantized hall conductors appear if symmetry allows a topological term in the sigma model.@xcite    all anderson transitions in the standard , wigner - dyson symmetry classes are expected to share certain general features . </S>",
    "<S> one is that the density of states ( dos ) is a smooth function of energy , and hence noncritical at a transition . </S>",
    "<S> another is universality , in the sense that , for a given symmetry and dimensionality , only one type of behavior is expected .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now widely appreciated that the range of possibilities is not exhausted by the wigner - dyson classes , and there exist additional symmetry classes . </S>",
    "<S> these additional classes are distinguished from the standard ones by possessing a particle - hole symmetry that selects as special one particular energy @xmath5 in the spectrum ( we take this to be @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , their density of states may be singular at @xmath2 and may have distinct behavior in each phase and at a critical point . while individual examples of systems from the additional symmetry classes have been known for many years , as tight - binding models with two sublattice structure,@xcite within random - matrix theory,@xcite and as models for superconductors,@xcite a full classification scheme was developed only more recently by altland and zirnbauer . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this scheme includes , in addition to the wigner - dyson classes , systems belonging to two additional types of symmetry class . </S>",
    "<S> one set , the chiral classes , arises in two sublattice systems . </S>",
    "<S> the other set is realized in models for noninteracting quasiparticles in disordered superconductors based on bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of models belonging to these additional symmetry classes have been a focus of attention in connection with understanding low - energy quasiparticle dos , transport , and localization properties in dirty superconductors , including those with unconventional pairing . among other features , </S>",
    "<S> the additional symmetry classes allow for versions of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in two - dimensional disordered superconductors with broken time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant quantized conductance in these cases is a thermal or spin conductance , since quasiparticle number is not conserved by the hamiltonian . for superconductors that are invariant under spin - rotations , </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry is referred to as class c , and the version of the quantum hall effect is known as the spin qhe . without spin rotation invariance </S>",
    "<S> , the symmetry is termed class d and one has the thermal qhe . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for a system of the class d has the following block structure in the particle - hole space @xcite : @xmath6 which is determined by the condition @xmath7 ( in addition to the hermiticity @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can work in a different basis , defining @xmath9 with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> in this basis , the defining condition of class d becomes @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 is purely imaginary . </S>",
    "<S> it is the systems with this symmetry that are the subject of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature of this class is that symmetry and dimensionality alone are insufficient to determine behavior . at the level of the nonlinear sigma model , the reason is believed to be that the relevant target space has two disconnected pieces and that , depending on the choice of underlying microscopic model , it may or may not be necessary to consider configurations containing domain walls on which the sigma model field jumps between the two components.@xcite in the following , we investigate the cho - fisher ( cf ) network model@xcite for the thermal qhe . this model is generic in the sense that it displays all three phases possible in a two - dimensional class d system : the metal , the insulator , and the quantized hall conductor . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in a closely related model  a fermionic version of the @xmath13 random bond ising model ( rbim )  the metallic phase is absent.@xcite    the location of the metallic phase and the two localized phases in the phase diagram of the cf model </S>",
    "<S> is indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] , together with phase boundaries of two types , corresponding to metal - insulator and plateau transitions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this phase diagram was obtained in ref .   from transfer - matrix calculations </S>",
    "<S> ; let us explain why its structure may be quite naturally anticipated . in the absence of disorder ( @xmath14 ) </S>",
    "<S> the system has a gap around @xmath2 for all @xmath15 except for @xmath16 ( where the dos vanishes linearly at zero energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> one thus expects that the system remains insulating for weak disorder ( small @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more carefully , analyzing the edge states in the both limits of uncoupled plaquettes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , one observes that there are two topologically different insulating phases . from symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> if there is a direct transition between these phases , it must occur at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , with increasing @xmath17 , the disorder creates a substantial dos at @xmath2 , and the system may be expected to undergo a transition into the metallic phase , which generically exists in two - dimensional systems with spin - orbit coupling .    , the interplaquette tunneling probability , and @xmath17 , the concentration of vortex disorder : these control the short - distance values of the conductivity components @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively.,width=302 ]    two - dimensional systems from class d </S>",
    "<S> have attracted considerable attention recently . </S>",
    "<S> the sigma model analysis @xcite starts from a short - distance description in terms of a diffusive metal with a smooth dos that is finite at @xmath2 . from a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis ( perturbative in @xmath23 , the inverse dimensionless conductance ) , </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the diffusion constant is unrenormalized at leading order and that the dos has a logarithmic divergence near zero energy , which is given in terms of the diffusion constant @xmath24 and the mean free path @xmath25 by @xmath26    an alternative approach to the theory of these systems , arguably tailored to describe the plateau transition , has been developed in ref .   by starting from a model of dirac fermions with random mass and treating this disorder perturbatively , in the spirit of the analysis of the ising model by dotsenko and dotsenko.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the disorder - free system has a transition , driven by tuning a uniform mass through zero , which in the cf model lies at @xmath27 , @xmath28 . in the vicinity of the clean fixed point representing this transition </S>",
    "<S> , the disorder strength @xmath29 is marginally irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> this implies for the critical dos a logarithmic correction term ( see appendix  [ s - a1 ] ) of the form @xmath30 clearly , since this calculation is for a system with weak , homogeneous disorder , its relevance for behavior in the cf model with dilute , strong scatterers needs to be tested .    in the localized phases , past work suggests several possibilities for the behavior of the dos near @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest approach is to imagine that the sample can be divided into independent regions of size set by the localization length and that the contribution of each region to the dos can be obtained from random - matrix theory for this symmetry class,@xcite giving finite @xmath0 at @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatives are suggested by the fact that the off - critical , disorder - free model ( @xmath27 , @xmath32 ) has a gap in the dos around @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as has been well - studied in one - dimensional system , rare disorder configurations ( termed griffiths strings ) may fill in this gap , generating a dos that varies as a positive or negative power of @xmath3 near @xmath31.@xcite behavior of this kind has been found recently in the network model representation of the rbim.@xcite    the purpose of this article is to present numerical studies of the behavior of the dos in the cf model . </S>",
    "<S> an outline is as follows . in sec .  [ </S>",
    "<S> s2 ] , we describe the model and our numerical methods . section  [ s3 ] is central for the paper and contains our main findings . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze first ( sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s3.1 ] ) the low - energy dos in the metallic phase ( at large @xmath17 ) and confirm the logarithmic divergence , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e1 ] ) . as an additional manifestation of metallic behavior </S>",
    "<S> , we find random - matrix - theory ( rmt ) oscillations in the dos superseding this logarithmic behavior at lowest energies . at smaller @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> one enters a localized phase ( sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s3.2 ] ) where neither a logarithmic divergence nor oscillations are observed . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the dos remains finite at zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s3.3 ] , we turn to the plateau transition which occurs for low @xmath17 on the self - dual line @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find in a wide energy interval that the behavior of dos is consistent with the rg result , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ s4 ] we summarize our findings and discuss directions for future work . a brief description of an alternative microscopic model and results obtained for it are given in appendix [ s - a2 ] : these results are very close to those for the cf model , supporting the idea that the latter is generic . </S>"
