    "an exclusive analysis of the denz04 dcss had been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , after applying to these data the same analysis criteria which had been used earlier @xcite in a pwa of the rest of the low - energy ( pion laboratory kinetic energy @xmath7 mev ) @xmath5 elastic - scattering measurements .    in the first part of our paper @xcite ( optimisation )",
    ", we had analysed the denz04 dcss following two theoretical approaches , one featuring standard low - energy parameterisations of the @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave @xmath10-matrix elements , the other using the @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave @xmath10-matrix elements of the eth model   interaction contains @xmath11-channel @xmath2- and @xmath12-exchange graphs , as well as the @xmath8- and @xmath13-channel contributions with all the well - established @xmath8 and @xmath9 baryon states with masses below @xmath14 gev ; the model amplitudes obey crossing symmetry and isospin invariance . ]",
    "both ways failed to produce acceptable results .",
    "we subsequently investigated the reproduction of the denz04 dcss on the basis of the results of ref .",
    "the comparison revealed large discrepancies in the denz04 @xmath1 data sets at forward and medium scattering angles , at all five energies covered by the chaos experiment .",
    "we thus concluded that the angular distribution of the denz04 @xmath1 dcss was incompatible ( in shape ) with the rest of the modern ( meson - factory ) low - energy database .",
    "owing to the fact that the present paper reports the results of a new analysis of the denz04 dcss , the overlap with the material of ref .",
    "@xcite is inevitable .",
    "there are three main reasons for embarking on a new analysis of these measurements .",
    "* included now in our results , for the first time , are also the uncertainties of the theoretical values ( @xmath15 ) when investigating the reproduction of experimental data sets on the basis of a given ` theoretical ' solution ( from now on , ` baseline solution ' or bls ) ; these uncertainties are sizeable in some kinematical regions covered by the chaos experiment , e.g. , in backward @xmath16 elastic scattering .",
    "it is worth noting that , compared to our past pwas , the uncertainties @xmath15 are now somewhat larger , as they also contain the effects of the variation of the @xmath2-meson mass @xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "* recent developments regarding the proton electromagnetic form factors suggest the replacement of the forms we have used earlier .",
    "the parameterisation of the dirac @xmath18 and the pauli @xmath19 form factors of the proton with ( traditional ) dipole forms has been found to provide a poor description of the ` world ' electron - proton ( @xmath20 ) unpolarised and polarised data @xcite .",
    "although the sensitivity of our results to the details of the parameterisation of these quantities is low ( due to the smallness of the @xmath21 transfer at low energies ) , we will nevertheless adopt a more recent parameterisation scheme . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors made use of the so - called pad parameterisation @xcite for the sachs electromagnetic form factors @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , the superscript @xmath9 is omitted ) , and obtained the optimal values for the relevant parameters from a fit to @xmath20 measurements ( see their table ii ) .",
    "the value of the proton rms electric charge radius @xmath24 , evaluated from the content of that table ( in fact , from the values of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , is almost identical to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , thus disagreeing with the @xmath24 value extracted from muonic hydrogen @xcite . from now on",
    ", we will use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in our analysis software .",
    "the pion form factor @xmath27 is usually parameterised via a monopole form , e.g. , see ref .",
    "despite the fact that , in the low - energy region , results of similar quality are obtained with either a monopole or a dipole form , we will adopt the monopole parameterisation henceforth .",
    "* the fits of the eth model to the experimental data now involve the variation of @xmath17 within the interval which is currently recommended by the particle - data group ( pdg ) @xcite , namely between @xmath28 and @xmath29 mev .",
    "the earlier fits were made assuming a fixed @xmath17 value ( @xmath30 mev @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite , is now explicitly included in the first step of the optimisation ( low - energy parameterisations of the @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave @xmath10-matrix elements ) ; this change induces very small effects in the fits to the @xmath16 elastic - scattering data .",
    "b ) an improved approach for fixing the ( small ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 waves has been implemented ; to suppress artefacts which are due to the truncation of small values , simple polynomials are now fitted to the @xmath32- and @xmath33-wave phase shifts of the current solution of the said analysis @xcite .",
    "c ) used in refs .",
    "@xcite were the results of an earlier compilation of the physical constants by the pdg ; the results of the most recent compilation @xcite are used herein .    the present paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , we give the details regarding the assessment of the goodness of the reproduction of an experimental data set on the basis of a bls .",
    "the tests are now optimally structured and may be generally used in such investigations ; for instance , we can use the prescribed tests to assess the reproduction of the @xmath16 charge - exchange ( @xmath34 ) data on the basis of elastic - scattering results ( pursuing the investigation of the violation of the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath0 interaction ) .",
    "section [ sec : results ] contains the results we obtained from the new analysis of the denz04 dcss .",
    "we briefly discuss the implications of our findings in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "prior to advancing to the technical details , we will give a few definitions which are of relevance in the discussion ; if introduced later , they might disrupt the smooth description of the three tests delineated in the present section .",
    "for our purposes , a bls is defined as follows .    *",
    "a bls is a set of values and associated uncertainties ( @xmath35 , @xmath15 , @xmath36 $ ] ) , corresponding to the values of the kinematical variables , i.e. , of the centre - of - mass scattering angle @xmath37 and of @xmath38 , at which the experimental data ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath36 $ ] ) have been acquired .",
    "the indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 identify the particular measurement , namely as the @xmath43 data point of the @xmath44 data set .",
    "the number of data points of the @xmath44 data set is denoted as @xmath45 . *",
    "a bls comprises predictions obtained via a monte - carlo simulation taking into account the results of the optimisation ( i.e. , the fitted values and the uncertainties of the model parameters , as well as the covariance matrix of each fit ) of a pwa of @xmath0 data .",
    "being a sum of independent normalised residuals , each following the normal distribution , our test - statistic is expected to follow the @xmath46 distribution . as we will concentrate on this distribution hereafter , aiming at the identification of data sets which are poorly reproduced",
    ", we will tailor all expressions of the present section to _ one - sided _ tests ( right - tail events ) .",
    "let us assume that the background process , underlying the phenomenon under investigation , is a stochastic one ( or , equivalently , that the null hypothesis is valid ) , described by the probability density function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a numerical result obtained via a measurement made on the observed system .",
    "kolmogorov s second axiom dictates that @xmath49 the so - called p - value   is defined as the upper tail of the corresponding cumulative distribution function : @xmath50 the p - value is the probability that a measurement , obtained from the observed system , yield a result @xmath51 which is more statistically significant than @xmath52 ( in our case , that @xmath53 ) . assuming the validity of the null hypothesis , the p - value may thus be used as a measure of the result @xmath52 being due to chance : ` small ' p - values attest to the statistical significance of that measurement .    of course , before assessing the statistical significance of a measurement",
    ", one must define what is meant by ` small ' p - values .",
    "unfortunately , the threshold signifying the outset of statistical significance is subjective ; in reality , the setting of the significance level   in statistics . ]",
    "@xmath54 rests on a delicate trade - off between two risks : a ) of accepting the alternative hypothesis ( of an effect not being due to statistical contrivance ) when it is false and b ) of rejecting the alternative hypothesis when it is true .",
    "of relevance in the choice of the @xmath54 value is which of these two risks is being assigned greater importance . for instance , if the implications of risk ( b ) are considered to be more severe , compared to those of risk ( a ) , an increase of the @xmath54 value is tenable .",
    "most statisticians accept @xmath55 as the outset of statistical significance and @xmath56 as the threshold indicating probable significance .",
    "an interesting recent paper @xcite interprets the lack of reproducibility of scientific results in various disciplines as evidence that the currently - accepted @xmath54 values are rather ` optimistic ' ; the author thus recommends the reduction of these thresholds by one order of magnitude   physics is concerned , the main reason might simply be ` excessive optimism ' when assessing the systematic effects in the experiments ; in all probability , these uncertainties are frequently , if not systematically , underestimated . ] .",
    "the probability density function of the @xmath46 distribution with @xmath57 degrees of freedom ( dof ) is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the standard gamma function : @xmath60 for a quantity @xmath51 following the @xmath46 distribution , the expectation value @xmath61 $ ] is simply equal to @xmath62 and the variance @xmath63-(e[x])^2 $ ] is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the relation @xmath61=\\nu$ ] has led many physicists to the use of the reduced @xmath46 value ( i.e. , of the ratio @xmath65 ) when assessing the goodness of the data description in modelling ; as long as @xmath66 , the results are claimed to be satisfactory .",
    "of course , the interesting question in the statistical hypothesis testing relates to the value of @xmath65 at which the results start appearing _ _",
    "un__satisfactory ; evidently , a threshold value for @xmath65 may be extracted from @xmath54 , yet it turns out to be @xmath62-dependent , hence cumbersome to use .",
    "such a departure from simplicity is meaningless .",
    "it makes more sense to perform the direct test and assess the statistical significance by comparing the p - value , associated with the observed @xmath46 for @xmath62 dof , with @xmath54 ; this is achieved by simply inserting @xmath67 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq02 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq01 ] ) , along with @xmath68 , and evaluating the integral ; several software implementations of dedicated algorithms are available , e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ( chapter on ` gamma function and related functions ' ) and @xcite , the routine prob of the cern software library , the functions chidist / chisq.dist.rt of microsoft excel , etc .    one additional ` side ' remark is due .",
    "various definitions of the ` data set ' have been in use , involving different choices of the experimental conditions which must remain stable / constant during the data - acquisition session .",
    "the properties of the incident beam , as well as the ( physical , geometrical ) properties of the target , have been used in the past in order to distinguish the data sets of experiments performed at one place ( i.e. , at a meson factory ) over a short period of time ( typically , a few weeks ) .",
    "however , data sets have appeared in experimental reports relevant to the @xmath0 system , which not only involved different beam energies , but also contained measurements of different reactions ( e.g. , mixing @xmath1 _ and _ @xmath16 elastic - scattering measurements ) . as a result ,",
    "the only prerequisite for accepting measurements as comprising one data set is that they share the same absolute normalisation ( and , consequently , normalisation uncertainty @xmath69 ) .",
    "of course , this is only a prerequisite , hence a necessary , not a sufficient , condition .",
    "the decision regarding the acceptance of a set of measurements as comprising one data set can not be made without an investigation of the stability of the experimental conditions at which the raw measurements had been acquired ( this may be difficult to assess ) , as well as of their ( on - line and off - line ) processing on the way to the extraction of the final experimental results .",
    "we now enter the details of the reproduction .",
    "let us assume that the absolute normalisation of the @xmath44 data set is known up to a relative uncertainty @xmath69 .",
    "let us also assume that none of the important quantities , appearing in the denominators of the expressions of the present section , vanishes .",
    "( for the sake of compatibility with our past works @xcite , we will retain the index @xmath42 in the expressions , despite the fact that its use in this section is redundant . )    one way of assessing the goodness of the reproduction of the @xmath44 data set involves the determination of the amount of scaling ( application of a multiplicative factor to the bls , enabling the increase or decrease of its values , resulting in its ` upward ' or ` downward ' shift as ` one piece ' ) which must be applied to the bls ( @xmath35 , @xmath15 , @xmath36 $ ] ) in order that it ` best ' accounts for the entire data set ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath36 $ ] ) .",
    "regarding the reproduction of data sets by a bls , we have gained inspiration from the arndt - roper formula @xcite , which we have been using in our fits to the experimental data since ref .",
    "we will next propose tests of the overall reproduction , of the shape , and of the absolute normalisation of the data sets .",
    "we first evaluate the ratios , @xmath70 ; if the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath35 are independent ( which is certainly true in our case , as the denz04 measurements have not been used in the determination of the bls ) , the uncertainties @xmath71 are obtained via the application of gauss s error - propagation formula : @xmath72    the goodness of the reproduction is assessed on the basis of the function @xmath73 defined as : @xmath74 it is convenient to introduce the weights @xmath75 via the relation @xmath76 .    the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq05 ] ) takes account of the application of scaling to the bls .",
    "this contribution depends on how well the absolute normalisation of the @xmath44 data set is known . for a poorly - known absolute normalisation",
    ", @xmath69 is large and the resulting contribution from the scaling is small ; the opposite is true in case of a well - known absolute normalisation .",
    "evidently , the ` best ' reproduction of the @xmath44 data set is achieved when , by varying the scale factor @xmath77 , the function @xmath73 is minimised : @xmath78 the solution of this equation is @xmath79 inserting this expression for @xmath77 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq05 ] ) , one obtains @xmath80    expression ( [ eq : eq08 ] ) yields the minimal @xmath46 value in the description of the @xmath44 data set , containing @xmath45 data points .",
    "in fact , one additional measurement had been made on this data set , namely the one fixing its absolute normalisation , which is known with relative uncertainty @xmath69 . as a result ,",
    "the number of dof for this data set is equal to @xmath81 ; the subtraction of one unit is due to the use of eq .",

    "( [ eq : eq02 ] ) , along with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "two additional tests on each data set are possible .",
    "these tests are particularly useful in case that the overall reproduction of a data set is poor ; they point to the culprit for the poor overall reproduction , namely to the shape or to the absolute normalisation of the data set .    * to examine the shape of the @xmath44 data set ( with respect to that of the bls )",
    ", it is important to allow the bls to reproduce the data set ` optimally ' , i.e. , regardless of the scaling .",
    "this is equivalent to setting @xmath87 or @xmath88 in eqs .",

    "* when investigating the reproduction of an experiment on the basis of a given ` theoretical ' solution , our results also include now the uncertainties @xmath15 of the theoretical values ( see eq .",

    "additionally , the pion electromagnetic form factor will be parameterised via a monopole form . *",
    "the fits of the eth model @xcite to the experimental data now involve the variation of the @xmath2-meson mass ( @xmath17 ) within the interval which is recommended by the particle - data group @xcite ( currently , between @xmath28 and @xmath29 mev ) .    the new analysis of the chaos dcss demonstrated that the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite hold and that the angular distribution of their @xmath1 cross sections is in conflict with the rest of the modern ( meson - factory ) low - energy @xmath1 database .",
    "one might argue that a disagreement between any two sets of data attests only to the faultiness of at least one of them . in order to determine which of the two sets of values is flawed ,",
    "the insight gained from theory is often valuable . to this end , we analysed the two sets of measurements , irrespective of one another , by employing two theoretical approaches in the analysis , namely the standard low - energy parameterisations of the @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave @xmath10-matrix elements and the eth model . we are critical of the dcss of the chaos collaboration because we have not been able to obtain anything reasonable from the analysis of these data following _ either _ theoretical approach .",
    "on the contrary , we did not encounter problems when analysing the rest of the modern database following _ both _ theoretical approaches . as the beam energy in the chaos experiments was sufficiently low , an investigation of the description of their dcss within the framework of the chiral perturbation theory ( e.g. , with the method of ref .",
