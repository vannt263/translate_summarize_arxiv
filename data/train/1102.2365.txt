    "it has been shown @xcite that in a completely degenerate astrophysical object such as a white dwarf the electrons , which follow fermi - dirac statistics rather than that of boltzmann , become relativistically degenerate due to gigantic inward gravitational pressure and this can lead to softening of the degeneracy pressure giving rise to the ultimate collapse of the star .",

    "the relativistic degeneracy is a completely quantum phenomenon ruled by the uncertainty principle and is increased due to the decrease in inter - fermion distances in degenerated plasmas . although the relativistic effects arise due to increase in fermion number - density in a dense degenerate plasma , however , unlike for the low - pressure relativistic plasmas the degeneracy pressure in the fermion momentum fluid equation usually dominates the relativistic dynamic effects in super - dense plasma state .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite , combining the relativity and the quantum statistics , showed that for dense degenerate fermi - gas such as a white - dwarf with a mass - density , @xmath3 , the degeneracy pressure turns from @xmath28 ( with polytropic index @xmath29 ) dependence for normal degeneracy for the limit @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( with polytropic index @xmath32 ) dependence for ultra - relativistic degeneracy case in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "the relativistic degeneracy starts at mass density of about @xmath34 of the order in the core a @xmath35 white dwarf , which corresponds to a fermi - momentum @xmath36 ( corresponding to the relativistic degeneracy parameter value of @xmath37 ) or the threshold velocity of @xmath38 ( the fermi relativistic factor @xmath39 ) . now comparing the terms in the momentum equation eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) reveals that the term containing mass ratio is still negligible compared to the degeneracy pressure term .",

    ". however , this assumption breaks down for a relativistic low - pressure plasma and one has to follow a coherent relativistic formalism given in refs . @xcite .",
    "thus , for the range of the relativistic degeneracy parameter @xmath40 , which is used in our analysis ( see discussion ) , it is safe to neglect the relativistic dynamic effects compared to that of the dominant relativistic degeneracy pressure . on the other hand",
