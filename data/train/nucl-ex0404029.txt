    "study of open charm production provides valuable test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions for heavy quark production  @xcite .",
    "there are significant uncertainties in the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations of charm quark production depending on choices of the charm quark mass , the renormalization / factorization scale and the parton distribution function ( pdf )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the open charm measurement provides a constraint on the parameters used in the pqcd calculations .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath11 production cross section is an important issue .",
    "previously , most measurements of open charm production in hadronic interactions were from fixed - target experiments at lower energy ( @xmath1463 gev ) . only recently , cdf reported new results on open charm production in @xmath15 collisions in the high @xmath13 region from the collider experiment at @xmath16=1.96 tev  @xcite .",
    "the open charm cross section has been studied in au+au collisions at @xmath2=130 gev indirectly through measurements of single electrons from the open charm semi - leptonic decay  @xcite .",
    "the charm quark is generally believed to be produced primarily through gluon fusion ( @xmath17 ) in parton - parton hard scattering due to its heavy mass , which makes the charm quark an important probe to the properties of matter formed in the early stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "theoretical calculations predicted that the open charm cross section in aa collisions would be significantly enhanced with respect to purely hadronic production  @xcite as a consequence of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "some studies have already attributed the increased yield of dileptons in the intermediate mass region reported by na50 to open charm enhancement  @xcite . on the other hand , the open charm momentum spectrum",
    "may also be modified in aa collisions due to final state interactions such as parton energy loss in medium .",
    "however , it is predicted that energy loss of a charm quark should be considerably smaller compared to a light quark as a consequence of the dead - cone effect , leading to an enhanced @xmath18 ratio as a function of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the relative fraction of the charm quark hadronization into different open charm species is nearly the same in elementary particle collisions ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 etc )  @xcite .",
    "could the charm quark hadronization be modified in aa collisions ?",
    "a calculation based on the statistical coalescence model  @xcite does show that ratios of open charm species in aa collisions would be different from those in the elementary collisions .",
    "furthermore , at rhic , the predicted @xmath22 suppression has to be investigated with respect to the total open charm cross section since the drell - yen cross section , which is the reference of the @xmath22 suppression at sps , is small in comparison with the open charm cross section at rhic . in order to investigate the outstanding physics issues mentioned above ,",
    "it is crucial to study open charm production in a less complicated system , where the nuclear effects , like qgp formation , parton energy loss , are not expected .",
    "the @xmath1+au experiment at rhic provides such an essential reference .",
    "the main detector involved in this data analysis is the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) in a 0.5 t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "a zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) in the au beam direction was used for the minimum bias trigger by requiring at least one beam - rapidity neutron in this zdc .",
    "this trigger accepts 95@xmath23% of the @xmath1+au hadronic cross section . for a detail description of the star detector ,",
    "see  @xcite . in this study , about 15 million @xmath1+au minbias events with primary vertex position in beam direction within @xmath24 cm around the tpc center",
    "were analyzed .",
    "the primary vertex reconstruction efficiency is 93@xmath25 1% of triggered minimum bias events .",
    "the correlation between the measured momentum and the ionization energy loss ( de / dx ) of charged particles in the tpc gas were used for particle identification .",
    "the measured @xmath26 can be well described by the bethe - bloch function smeared with a resolution of width @xmath27 .",
    "the open charm are reconstructed through their hadronic decay channels ( and their charge conjugates ) : @xmath28 ( br=3.8% ) , @xmath29 , @xmath30(br=9.1% ) and @xmath31 .",
    "event mixing technique  @xcite was used to reconstruct open charm mass peaks .",
    "the measured charged multiplicity distribution in the region of @xmath32 was divided into 40 bins and the primary vertex position distribution was divided into 15 primary vertex bins .",
    "each event was mixed with 5 other events within the same multiplicity bin and primary vertex bin .",
    "tracks within 2 @xmath27 of the pion bethe - bloch curve and 3 @xmath27 of the kaon bethe - bloch curve were selected . in the momentum region of @xmath33 0.6 gev/@xmath4 where the kaon and pion de / dx bands merge ,",
    "the nominal kaon and pion masses were assumed in turn for each track .",
    "it was also required that the closet approach distance of a track to the primary vertex , @xmath34 , be smaller than 1.5 cm with exception of the soft pions , @xmath35 , from @xmath36 decays where @xmath37 cm was used .    in the following subsections",
    ", we will discuss the analysis method for each decay channel .",
    "for this analysis only tracks within @xmath39 were accepted . the transverse momentum and",
    "total momentum cut of a track were between 0.2 to 10 gev/@xmath4 and 0.3 to 10 gev/@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the resulting invariant mass distribution after event - mixing background subtraction was shown in fig.([d00]a ) , where a clear @xmath6 signal was seen alone with a residual background distribution .",
    "we fit the histogram with a gaussian function for signal plus a linear background . from the fit ,",
    "the mass and width ( @xmath27 ) of the @xmath6 signal was found to be 1.863@xmath25 0.003 gev/@xmath40 and 13.8@xmath252.8 mev/@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "an independent analysis for @xmath42 was performed where only tracks within @xmath43 were accepted .",
    "the transverse momentum and total momentum cut of a track were set between 0.3 to 10 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the analysis is similar to that for @xmath28 except that additional @xmath44 and @xmath45 candidate tracks , if their invariant mass satisfied 0.62 gev/@xmath46 gev/@xmath4 , were combined with the selected @xmath47 and @xmath44 candidate tracks to form a @xmath6 candidate with invariant mass m(@xmath48 ) .",
    "the mass plot after event mixing background subtraction is shown in fig.([d00]b ) .",
    "we fit the histogram with a gaussian function for signal plus a linear background . from the fit ,",
    "the mass and width ( @xmath27 ) of the @xmath6 signal were found to be 1.852@xmath25 0.005 gev/@xmath40 and 13.6@xmath254 mev/@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the track cuts for kaon and pion candidates from @xmath6 decay in the @xmath50 analysis were the same as those used in the @xmath51 analysis .",
    "however , special treatments were needed for the soft pion daughter , @xmath52 , which has an average momentum of about 50 mev . for the soft pion candidates",
    "it was required that the transverse momentum and total momentum cut be set between 0.1 to 1.0 gev/@xmath4 and the ratio of the @xmath6 to @xmath35 momentum , @xmath53)/@xmath54 .",
    "first , the invariant mass of kaon and pion candidate tracks , @xmath55 , was calculated and the @xmath6 candidate which satisfied 1.82@xmath561.90 gev/@xmath40 were kept . a soft pion candidate , with a charge opposite to that of the kaon candidate ,",
    "was then combined with the @xmath6 candidate to form a @xmath36 candidate with invariant mass @xmath57 .",
    "fig.([d02]a ) shows the distribution of the mass difference , @xmath58 , for @xmath59 candidates after all cuts .",
    "a clear signal was seen around the nominal value of @xmath60 .",
    "we fit the mass distribution with a sum of a gaussian function describing the signal and a linear background . from the fit",
    ", the mass difference and width ( @xmath27 ) of the @xmath50 signal were found to be 146.37@xmath250.15 mev/@xmath40 and 0.57@xmath250.16 mev/@xmath40 .",
    "the track cuts used for the @xmath62 analysis were the same as those for the @xmath36 analysis with the exception that no special treatment for the pion candidate was needed .",
    "fig.([d02]b ) shows the @xmath63 distribution for the @xmath62 candidates after all the cuts .",
    "a clear signal was seen at the nominal value of @xmath64 .",
    "the mass distribution was fit to a sum of a gaussian function describing the signal and a linear background . from the fit ,",
    "the mass and width ( @xmath27 ) of the @xmath50 signal were found to be 1.861@xmath25 0.008 gev/@xmath40 and 16.9@xmath254.6 mev/@xmath40 .",
    "fig.([dspectra ] ) shows the invariant multiplicity distributions of the measured open charms as a function of @xmath13 after the reconstruction efficiency correction , which is about 40%-60% ( increasing with @xmath13 ) except for @xmath36 at low @xmath13 ( eg .",
    "6% at @xmath13=1.5 gev/@xmath4 due to the low reconstruction efficiency of the soft pions ) .",
    "the spectrum was corrected for vertex and trigger efficiency . for @xmath65",
    ", a correction was also done through a monte carlo simulation for the correlation around the @xmath6 mass due to the misidentification of the kaon and pion from the @xmath6 decay .",
    "errors of the data points are statistical only and the data have been divided by 2 assuming @xmath66 .",
    "overlap between @xmath6 and @xmath36 at low @xmath13 and between the @xmath6 and @xmath67 at high @xmath13 allows us to compare the production cross sections of different open charm species .",
    "it was found that the inclusive cross sections of @xmath36 and @xmath67 are approximately equal .",
    "this observation is consistent with the measurements in  @xcite .    with the ratio of @xmath68(=@xmath69 ) as a free parameter we fit the all data points by a power - law function , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are parameters .",
    "from the fit , we obtained : @xmath73 and @xmath74 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "it was also found that @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath11 cross section can then be calculated by @xmath76 , where the factor 1.24 includes the contribution from unmeasured @xmath77 and charm baryons ( @xmath78 etc . )",
    "@xcite . assuming number of binary collision scaling ,",
    "one could obtain @xmath79 for nucleon - nucleon collisions by @xmath80 , where @xmath81  mb and @xmath82  @xcite are the inelastic cross section for a nucleon - nucleon collision and number of binary collisions in @xmath1+a collisions at @xmath2=200 gev , respectively .",
    "the factor 4.6 accounts for the ratio of the @xmath6 multiplicity in the full rapidity region to @xmath83 at mid - rapidity and was obtained from a pyhtia  @xcite calculation with parameters tuned to fit our measured spectrum  @xcite . with the measured @xmath83 and @xmath9 ratio ,",
    "the @xmath84 for nucleon - nucleon collisions is found to be @xmath85  mb .",
    "we also studied open charm production through measurements of single electrons from the open charm semileptonic decay .",
    "fig.([electron ] ) shows the electron spectra for @xmath1+au and @xmath86 collisions at @xmath2=200 gev , after background subtraction in comparison with the expected electron spectrum based on the decay of the star measured open charm spectrum ( the bands ) .",
    "the background electrons are mainly from @xmath87-conversion in the detector and from the @xmath88 and @xmath89 dalitz decay .",
    "the single electrons were measured by both time of flight ( tof ) ( solid symbols ) and tpc de / dx ( open symbols ) .",
    "the width of the bands reflects the uncertainties in the calculation . for details about these measurements ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the open charm measurements through direct constructions of open charm signals and through the single electron measurement are consistent within star .",
    "the single electrons were also measured using the star barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) up to 7.0 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "fig.([emcfig ] ) gives the background subtracted electron spectra for @xmath1+au ( circles ) and @xmath86 ( triangles ) collisions together with the calculations of pythia with the modified parameters  @xcite .",
    "the pythia curves shows that in the region of @xmath90 gev/@xmath4 the contribution of b meson decays to electrons starts to overtake that of d meson decays , which is the clear indication at rhic that the bottom quark contributes significantly to the measured high @xmath13 electrons .",
    "for details of this analysis , see  @xcite .    in fig.([ratio ] ) , the star measured @xmath91 is compared with the previous measurements  @xcite and with theoretical predictions  @xcite . within the experimental uncertainties the ratio shows little dependence on collision system and energy .",
    "the measured open charm spectrum is compared with theoretical predictions from the saturation model  @xcite and pythia with parameters described in ref .",
    "@xcite in fig.([dima ] ) .",
    "note that the open charm spectrum has been scaled by @xmath92 .",
    "one sees that the measured open charm spectrum is much harder than the pythia prediction .",
    "however , the saturation model based on the @xmath93 factorization scheme does predict a harder spectrum in comparison with one obtained from the lo pqcd calculation in pythia .    in fig.([ramona ] ) , the nlo pqcd predictions of the c - quark spectrum  @xcite are compared with the star open charm spectrum .",
    "the pqcd parameters in these calculations are @xmath94 ( charm quark mass)=1.2 gev/@xmath40 , @xmath95(factorization scale)=@xmath96 ( renormalization scale)=2 @xmath97 ( transverse mass of the charm quark ) for the mrst ho pdf curve , and @xmath94=1.3 gev/@xmath40 , @xmath95=@xmath96=@xmath97 for the grv98 ho pdf curve .",
    "the theoretical curves have been normalized to the measured cross section though the @xmath11 cross sections from nlo calculations significantly underestimates the measured one ( eg . by a factor of 3 with the mrst ho pdf ) .",
    "it is interesting that the measured spectrum shape of the open charm coincides with those of the c - quark , especially the one obtained with grv98 ho parton structure functions .",
    "such a coincidence between the nlo c - quark spectrum and the measured open charm meson spectrum in charm hadroproduction has been observed in the fixed target experiments at low energies  @xcite . in order to fit with data , the intrinsic@xmath98 model had to be introduced to counter -",
    "balance the effect of c - quark hadronization through a fragmentation function of peterson form  @xcite . at rhic , however , adding intrinsic@xmath98 with a moderate @xmath99 would not help to overcome the momentum degradation of the fragmentation process because the charm quark spectrum is very broad .",
    "such an observation may indicate that the hadronization of a c - quark through the peterson fragmentation function , which was established in charm photoproduction  @xcite and in @xmath100 collisions  @xcite , is not suitable in case of charm hadroproduction .",
    "experimental data may suggest a fragmentation function more peaked towards the @xmath101 region .",
    "a hadronization scheme of open charm production through quark recombination  @xcite was also proposed  @xcite .",
