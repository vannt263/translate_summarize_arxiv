    "high - energy cosmic rays carry information from their source and from the medium where they have propagated in their way to the earth . they may be charged particles ( protons , nuclei or electrons ) or neutral ( photons and neutrinos ) .",
    "the main difference between these two types of astroparticles is that the first one loses directionality through interactions with galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , random background fields of order @xmath0 @xmath1 g in our galaxy will uncorrelate a particle from its source after a distance larger than @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the unit charge and @xmath4 the energy of the particle . as @xmath4 grows the reach of charged particles increases , extending the distance where they may be used as astrophysical probes . at @xmath5",
    "gev this distance becomes 1 mpc , and cosmic rays may bring information from an extragalactic source .",
    "of course , it seems difficult to imagine a situation where charged cosmic rays may be used to _ reveal _ or characterize an object . in this letter",
    "we propose that they can detect the presence of an astophysical object , _",
    "invisible _ to high - energy photons and neutrinos , that we name as _ cosmic magnetic lens _",

    "the term _ magnetic lensing _ has already been used in the astrophysical literature to describe , generically , the curved path of charged cosmic rays through a magnetized medium .",

    "@xcite considered lensing by the tangled field of the virgo cluster , assuming that the galaxy m87 was the single source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays .",
    "shaviv et al .",
    "@xcite studied the lensing near ultramagnetized neutron stars .",
    "our point of view , however , is different .",
    "the cml will be defined by a basic magnetic - field configuration with axial symmetry that could appear in astrophysical objects at any scale : from clusters of galaxies to planetary systems .",
    "the effect of the cml on galactic cosmic rays ( _ i.e. _ , charged particles of energy @xmath6 gev ) will not be significantly altered by turbulent magnetic fields if the lens is within the distance @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ rg ] ) and its magnetic field is substantially stronger than the average background field between its position and the earth . since the cml is a definite object , we can separate source , magnetic lens and observer . although it is not a lens in the geometrical optics sense ( the cml does not have a focus ) , its effects are generic and easy to parametrize , analogous to the ones derived from a gravitational lens ( with no focus neither ) .",
    "the basic configuration that we will consider is an azimuthal mean field @xmath8 in a disc of radius @xmath9 and thickness @xmath10 .",
    "the field lines are then circles of radius @xmath11 around the disk axis . as a first approximation we will take a constant intensity @xmath12 , neglecting any dependence on @xmath13 ( notice ,",
    "however , that a more realistic @xmath12 should vanish smoothly at @xmath14 and be continuous at @xmath15 ) . our assumption will simplify the analysis while providing all the main effects of a magnetic lens .",
    "the disk of most spiral galaxies has a large toroidal component of this type @xcite , so they are obvious candidates to cml .",
    "the configuration describing the cml would be natural wherever there is ionized gas in a region with turbulence , differential rotation and axial symmetry , since in such environment the magnetic field tends to be amplified by the _ dynamo effect _ @xcite .",
    "we will then assume that it may appear at any scale @xmath9 with an arbitrary value of @xmath12",

    "@xmath25    with @xmath26 . to understand its effect",
    ", we will first consider a particle moving in the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) plane with direction @xmath29 ( the case depicted in fig .  1 ) .",
    "when it enters the lens the cosmic ray finds an orthogonal magnetic field that curves its trajectory .",
    "the particle then rotates clockwise if the rotation from @xmath29 to @xmath30 around the axis @xmath31 is clockwise . ] around the axis @xmath32 , describing a circle of gyroradius @xmath33 .",
    "the segment of the trajectory inside the lens has a length @xmath34 , so the total rotation angle @xmath35 when it departs is @xmath36 the direction of the particle after crossing the lens is then @xmath37 .",
    "the angle @xmath35 will be the only parameter required to describe the effect of this basic lens .",
    "an important point is that @xmath8 and the lorentz force change sign if the trajectory goes through @xmath19 . in that case",
    "the deflection is equal in modulus but opposite to the one experience by particles going through @xmath17 ( see fig .  1 )",
    ". therefore , the effect of this lens is _ convergent _ , all trajectories are deflected the same angle @xmath35 towards the axis of the lens .",
    "notice that the lens changes to _ divergent _ for particles of opposite electric charge or for particles reaching the lens from the opposite ( @xmath38 ) side .",
    "the effect on a generic trajectory within a plane not necessarily orthogonal to the lens is a bit more involved .",
    "it is convenient to separate @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are parallel and orthogonal to the magnetic field , respectively ( and analogously for @xmath30 ) . in this case",
    "the magnetic field will rotate the initial direction @xmath29 an angle of @xmath42 around the axis @xmath31 : @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the parallel components of the initial and the final directions coincide , @xmath44 whereas the orthogonal component @xmath45 , of modulus @xmath46 , rotates into @xmath47    an important observation concerns the _ chromatic aberration _ of the lens .",
    "the deviation @xmath35 caused by a given cml is proportional to the inverse energy of the cosmic ray .",
    "if @xmath4 is small and @xmath48 , then the lens acts _ randomly _ on charged particles , diffusing them in all directions . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath4 is large the deviation becomes small and is smeared out as the particle propagates to the earth .",
    "only a region of the cosmic - ray spectrum can _ see _ the cml .",
    "let us now study the image of a localized monochromatic source produced by the cml .",
    "we will consider a _",
    "lens @xmath49 located on the plane @xmath50 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "its effect on a cosmic ray can be parametrized in terms of the angle @xmath35 given in eq .",
    "( [ alpha0 ] ) .",
    "the rotation axis is @xmath51 and the coordinates of source and observer are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we will use the axial symmetry of the lens to set @xmath54 .        the trajectory will intersect the cml at @xmath55 . there the initial direction @xmath29 will change to @xmath30 , with @xmath56     ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) for an observer at the axis .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    therefore , given a source @xmath62 , an observer @xmath63 and a lens producing a deviation @xmath35 , we can determine the coordinates @xmath55 where the rotation @xmath64 described in the previous section exactly transforms @xmath29 into @xmath30 .",
    "the first condition on @xmath65 and @xmath66 , given in eq .",
    "( [ parallel ] ) , is that @xmath8 does not change the longitudinal component of the velocity , @xmath67 the second one , derived from eq .",
    "( [ perp ] ) , defines the rotation of @xmath45 produced by the magnetic field .",
    "it can be written ( @xmath68 ) @xmath69 the second equation above is necessary to fully specify the rotation .",
    "notice that @xmath70 has a definite sign : positive for a convergent cml and negative for a divergent one .",
    "in addition , the solution must verify that @xmath71 .",
    "we find that for @xmath72 and a convergent lens there is always at least one solution , whereas for a divergent one there is a region around the axis that my be _ hidden _ by the cml ( this region disappears if @xmath12 goes smoothly to zero at the center of the lens ) . to illustrate the different possibilities in fig .",
    "3left we have placed the observer in the axis at a distance @xmath73 from the lens , @xmath74 , and have parametrized the position of the source ( at a distance @xmath75 from the lens ) as @xmath76 . in this case @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if the lens is convergent ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 , then the image of the source is just a single point . for a source at @xmath81",
    "we obtain two solutions , which correspond to trajectories from above or below the center of the lens . for a source in the axis ( @xmath60 )",
    "the solution is a ring of radius @xmath82    if the observer is located out of the axis but still in the @xmath28 plane the possibilities are similar , but the ring becomes a _ cross _ similar to the one obtained through gravitational lensing .",
    "finally , if we take the observer out of the @xmath28 plane there appears always a single solution .",
    "let us finally explore how the presence of a cml changes the flux @xmath83 of charged particles from a localized source @xmath62 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the case where @xmath62 is a homogeneous disk of radius @xmath84 placed at a distance @xmath75 from the lens and the observer @xmath63 is at a large distance @xmath73 , @xmath85 as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , we will assume that the magnetic field defining the lens goes smoothly to zero near the axis , and that the source is monochromatic .",
    "if there were no lens , @xmath63 would see @xmath62 under a solid angle @xmath86 if all the points on @xmath62 are equally bright and the emission is isotropic , the differential flux @xmath87 from all the directions inside the cone @xmath88 will be approximately the same , implying a total flux ( number of particles per unit area ) @xmath89    the lens in front of @xmath62 will deflect an approximate angle @xmath90 all trajectories crossing far from the axis . in fig .",
    "4 we have pictured the limiting directions reaching the observer , that define a cone @xmath91 @xmath63 sees now cosmic rays from directions inside the larger cone @xmath92 or , in other words , sees the radius @xmath84 of the source _ amplified _ to @xmath93 .     to @xmath63 with and without lens for a homogeneous and monochromatic source .",
    "[ fig4],width=359 ]    we can then use liouville s theorem to deduce how the flux observed by @xmath63 is affected by the presence of the lens . this theorem , first applied to cosmic rays moving inside a magnetic field by lemaitre and vallarta @xcite , implies that an observer following a trajectory will always observe the same differential flux ( or intensity , particles per unit area and solid angle ) along the direction defined by that trajectory . for example , in the case with no lens an observer in the axis at a distance @xmath94 will still observe the same differential flux @xmath95",
    ". however , the cone of directions that he sees will be smaller , @xmath96 , and the total flux from that source will scale like @xmath97 .",
    "the effect of the lens is then just to change the cone of directions reaching @xmath63 from @xmath62 , without changing the differential flux .",
    "this implies an integrated flux @xmath98 an important point is that the solid angle intervals @xmath99 will in general be much smaller than the angular resolution at @xmath63 . as a consequence , an observer trying to measure a differential flux will always include the whole cone @xmath99 within the same solid angle bin : only the integrated fluxes @xmath100 ( averaged over the angular resolution ) are observable .",
    "now let us suppose that there are many similar sources at approximately the same distance from the observer and covering a certain range of directions .",
    "cosmic rays emitted from each source will reach @xmath63 within a very tiny cone @xmath101 , and will be observed integrated over that cone and averaged over the angular resolution . if one of the sources has in front a cml , its cone @xmath102 at @xmath63 and thus its contribution to one of the direction bins will be larger , what would translate into a low - scale anisotropy within the range of directions covered by the sources ( see fig .  5 , left ) .     to @xmath63 without ( left ) and with ( right ) irregular magnetic fields along the trajectory .",
    "[ fig5],width=321 ]    in principle , this effect would not be erased by irregular magnetic fields from the source to the observer , that deflect the trajectories and tend to _ isotropize _ the fluxes ( in fig .",
    "5 , right ) .",
    "the contribution from the source behind the cml ( reaching now @xmath63 from a different direction ) will still tend to be larger .",
    "the effect of the lens is to increase the _ size _ @xmath84 of the source to @xmath103 ; random magnetic fields will change the direction of arrival and the effective distance between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( _ i.e. _ , the direction and the size of the cone from each source ) , but not the initial deflection produced by the lens nor ( by liouville s theorem ) the differential flux within each tiny cone .",
    "therefore , the cone from the source behind the lens tends to be larger , and when integrated and averaged over the resolution bin may still introduce a low - scale anisotropy .",
    "the effect , however , tends to vanish if the cones are so small that the probability to observe two particles from the same cone of directions is smaller than the probability to observe particles from two disconnected cones with origin in the same source ( _ i.e. _ , in the deep diffuse regime where trajectories become random walks ) .",
    "finally , note that the effect of a divergent cml would be just the opposite .",
    "the presence of a lens could then introduce an excess for positive charged particles and a deffect for the negative ones ( or a matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry if both species were equally emitted by @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is known that galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields play a very important role in the propagation of charged cosmic rays .",
    "here we have explored the effect of a very simple configuration , a constant azimuthal field in a thin disk , that we identify as a cml .",
    "such object acts on cosmic rays _ like _ a gravitational lens on photons , with some very interesting differences .",
    "gravitational lenses are always convergent , whereas if a magnetic lens is convergent for protons and positrons , it changes to divergent for antiprotons and electrons . in addition , the deflection that the cml produces depends on the particle energy , so the lense is only visible in a very definite region ( around one decade of energy ) of the spectrum .",
    "our intention has been to introduce the concept of cml and discuss its possible effects leaving the search for possible candidates for future work .",
    "generically , the magnetic - field configuration defining the cml is _ natural _ and tends to be established by the dynamo effect .",
    "for example , in spiral galaxies @xmath8 can be pure azimuthal ( the one we have assumed ) , axisymmetric spiral or bisymmetric spiral , with or without reversals @xcite , but in all cases the azimuthal component dominates .",
    "our galaxy is not an exception @xcite , it includes in the disk a spiral magnetic field of @xmath104 @xmath1 g .",
    "this would actually force that any analysis of magnetic lensing by other galaxies must _ subtract _ the effect produced by our own magnetic field .",
    "cmls could also be present in galactic halos , as there are observations of polarized synchrotron emission suggesting the presence of regular fields @xcite .",
    "analogous indications @xcite can be found for larger structures , like clusters and their halos . inside our galaxy ,",
    "the antisymmetric tori placed 1.5 kpc away in both hemispheres discovered by han et al .",
    "@xcite would also produce magnetic lensing on ultrahigh energy cosmic rays . at lower scales ( 20800 pc )",
    "molecular clouds and hii regions @xcite are also potential candidates .",
    "molecular clouds have strong regular fields in the range of @xmath105@xmath106 mg @xcite . moreover , many reversals in the field direction observed in our galaxy seem to coincide with hii regions @xcite , which would indicate that the field follows the rotation velocity in that region .",
    "there are also observations of faraday screens covering angles of a few minutes of unknown origin @xcite .",
    "finally , nearby protostellar disks may provide a magnetic analogous of the gravitational microlenses , as they define small objects of @xmath107 au diameter with azimuthal magnetic fields @xcite of order tens of mg @xcite .",
    "therefore , we think it is justified to presume that cmls may appear at any scales @xmath9 with different values of @xmath12",
    ".    the lensing produced by a cml will be affected by the turbulent magnetic fields , but under certain conditions they should remain observable .",
    "for example , the typical lensing produced by a galaxy on cosmic rays of energy above @xmath108 gev is caused by a regular magnetic field of order @xmath1 g , while the distortions will come from fluctuations of the same order .",
    "the region of coherence of these magnetic fluctuations , however , is just around 10100 pc , varying randomly from cell to cell .",
    "since the regular field that define the lens will act along distances 10100 times larger , its effect on cosmic rays will dominate , and the expected _ blurring _ due to turbulences will be small . for cmls inside our galaxy one should in general _ subtract _ the effect due to the local field at the relevant scale .",
    "suppose , for example , that we have a small lens ( @xmath109 pc ) with a strong magnetic field ( @xmath0 mg ) at a distance below 10 pc from the earth .",
    "if the magnetic field along the trajectory from the lens to the earth is of order @xmath1 g ( with weaker turbulences at smaller scales ) then the effects of the lens on @xmath110 gev cosmic rays can be observed , but from a displaced direction . in any case , the identification of a cml would require a detailed simulation including a full spectrum of magnetic turbulences .",
    "we have studied the image of a point - like source , finding interesting patterns that are the analogous of the gravitational einstein s ring and einstein s cross . here the effect would be combined with a strong _ chromatic _ dependence , as the deviation is proportional to the inverse energy of the particle .",
    "the images would be absent ( or placed in a different location ) for particles of opposite charge , since they would find a divergent lens .",
    "we have also studied the effect of a cml on the flux from a localized source .",
    "if the source and the lens are far from the observer ( _ i.e. _ , if it covers a small solid angle ) it seems possible to generate small - scale anisotropies",
    ". it would be interesting to study if under certain conditions this type of fluctuations can survive into the diffuse regime ( tev cosmic rays ) observed by milagro @xcite .",
