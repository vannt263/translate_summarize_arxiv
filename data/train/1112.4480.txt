    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are brief and intense flashes of high energy gamma rays , originating at cosmological distances and often associated with radiation emitted at longer wavelengths for longer periods , identified as the afterglow .",
    "the afterglow is almost always detected in the x - ray band ( for @xmath1 of the events detected by _",
    "swift_-xrt ; evans et al . 2009 ) while the optical afterglow is not .",
    "the grbs that have no optical afterglow or a very low optical - to - x - flux ratio are classified as  dark burst \" .",
    "jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed that a grb  should be classified as  dark \" if the slope of the spectral energy distribution between the optical and the x - ray band ( @xmath2 ) is @xmath3 .",
    "this working definition is a direct implication of the simplest fireball model .",
    "in fact , the spectral index @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is related to the power - law index of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath6 ) and the location of the cooling frequency ( @xmath7 ) , independently of the nature of circumburst environment ( homogeneous or wind - like ) and the collimation of the outflow ( see sari et al .",
    "1998 ) . the average value of @xmath2 is then expected to be between 0.5 ( if @xmath6=2 and @xmath7 lies above the x - ray band ) and 1.25 ( if @xmath6=2.5 and @xmath7 lies below the optical frequency ) . therefore any optically sub - luminous burst should be located below a constant line @xmath8 in an optical vs. x - ray flux ( @xmath9 ) diagram , providing that the fluxes are estimated at a common time , chosen to be @xmath10  hr post - burst ( jakobsson et al .",
    "a slightly more elaborated method was presented by rol et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that compared the optical and x - rays fluxes at a given time extrapolating the latter to the optical band using not only the spectral index but also the temporal power - law index , in the context of the standard fireball model .",
    "both jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and rol et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found similar results ( @xmath11 of possible dark bursts ) on samples of pre-_swift _ grbs and these methods are still used as immediate diagnostic tools to discriminate between optically bright and dark bursts .",
    "recently , van der horst et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed a new method for the optical classification of dark grbs .",
    "their method is less affected by assumptions about the emitting region with respect to the one done in jakobsson et al .",
    "they improved the previous method by defining the region of optically ( sub - luminous ) dark bursts in the @xmath12 plane : they are located below the dividing line of @xmath13 . in the same diagram , optically bright bursts are placed above the line @xmath14 , while all the grbs that are still consistent with the fireball model will lie in the region defined by the relations @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "optically bright events , for which the optical luminosity is too high if compared to the x - ray luminosity , are pretty rare , while there is a sizable fraction of events for which the x - ray emission seems to be in excess with respect to the observed optical one .",
    "based on these definitions , studies on grbs samples in the _ swift_-era showed that , despite an advancement on the grb  detection quality both in the prompt response and position accuracy , the fraction of genuinely dark grbs remains significant .",

    "( 2011 ) found a fraction of dark grb  in their samples of about 50% , 50% , 20% , 20% , 30% and 40% respectively .",
    "a higher fraction of dark grbs is found in samples based on observations done by single ground based telescopes ( i.e. the 2-m liverpool and faulkes telescopes , melandri et al .",
    "2008 ; the 60-inch palomar telescope , cenko et al . 2009 ; the 2.2-m grond telescope , greiner et al .",
    "2011 ) while a smaller fraction is detected if the whole _ swift",
    "_ sample is considered ( gehrels et al .",
    "2008 for grbs up to end of 2007 ) .",
    "this difference is certainly related to the different properties of the grbs samples considered . in any case",
    "the population of dark bursts seems to be @xmath15 of the entire grb  class .    in the era of rapid follow - ups the darkness of these events",
    "could not be ascribed to lack of sensitivity , late observational times or rapid temporal decays ( roming et al .",
    "2006 , melandri et al .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to explain it :    * _ low - density scenario _ : if the relativistic ejecta decelerate in a uniform low - density medium then the optical afterglow can be intrinsically faint with respect to the x - ray emission ; * _ dust scenario _ : if dark bursts are exploding in galaxies with local thick and dusty ( i.e. , high metallicity ) environments ( with possibly some intervening systems along the line of sight ) their optical afterglows could be suppressed by extinction , without thereby affecting their higher energy radiation .",
    "the extinction law characterising the bursts environment might be similar to the one observed in the local universe or biased toward large dust grains ; * _ high redshift scenario _ :",
    "if the burst is occurring at very large distances , its visible light could be completely extinguished as a result of the absorption of the ly-@xmath16 forest and ly-@xmath16 dropout redshifted into the optical bands .",
    "the latter explanation seems to be responsible for the non - detection only for a small fraction of the population of  dark burst \" ( greiner et al .",
    "2011 ) , while a combination of the first two effects seems to be a more realistic scenario ( perley et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the properties of the population of  dark burst \" present in a complete sub - sample of _ swift _ long grbs , with a high percentage of redshift determination ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2011 , nava et al .",
    "the use of a complete sub - sample of grbs allowed us to draw more firm conclusions about the properties of this class of events with no bias in the selection criteria .",
    "the text is organised as follows : in section 2 we will describe the general properties of the dark bursts that belong to our selected sample .",
    "we then discuss the results on the dark bursts population , their redshift distribution and their luminosity in section 3 and finally we draw our conclusions in section 4 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a standard cosmology with with @xmath17  km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the 58 grbs in our sample have been selected to be relatively bright in the 15 - 150 kev _",
    "swift_-bat band , i.e. with the 1-s peak photon flux @xmath21  2.6 ph s@xmath18 @xmath22 , and have favourable conditions for ground - based multi - wavelength follow - up observations ; iii ) the grb declination is @xmath23 ; iv ) the sun - to - field distance is @xmath24 and v ) no nearby bright star is present . ]",
    "( salvaterra et al .",
    "2011 , nava et al .",
    "this corresponds to an instrument that is @xmath256 times less sensitive than _ swift_. therefore , whatever grb would have exploded in the sky with a flux equal or brighter than this limit , bat would have detected for sure ( if it was in its fov ) . with this limit",
    ", no grb would have been missed , in the meantime this value gives us also a reasonable number of grb to perform statistical studies .",
    "therefore our sample is complete with respect to this flux limit , it is of course biased toward the bright grbs , but it is complete .",
    "moreover , it turned out that @xmath26 of these bursts have also a redshift determination ( @xmath27 have a constrained redshift ) .    from the observed light curve of each burst in our sample ( as reported in the burst analyser of evans et al .",
    "2010 ) we estimated the fluxes at t@xmath28=11 hr in the x - rays ( @xmath29 at 3 kev is the de - absorbed flux . ] ) . in the optical band",
    "we used all the available public data to build the optical light curve , corrected for the galactic absorption , and measure the optical flux ( @xmath30 in the @xmath31 filter ) at t = t@xmath28 .",
    "we then used those two fluxes to calculate the values of the spectral index @xmath2 and we collected from the spectrum repository the values of the x - ray spectral index ( @xmath32 ) from the late time spectrum fit ( evans et al .",
    "all values are reported in table [ tabdb ] . for the majority of the bursts in our sample",
    "we were able to estimate the fluxes with good accuracy : in only one case ( grb  070328 ) it was not possible to estimate the optical flux due to the lack of optical observations . instead , for the cases that had not enough detections to sample their decay ,",
    "the value at 11 hr was estimated by interpolations and extrapolations of their observed light curve .",

    "the individual times at which @xmath30 was estimated were 0.97 , 0.54 , 33.7 ( host detection ) , 0.61 , 10.7 , 7.5 and 6.0 hr , respectively .",
    "this allow us to put a safe upper limit on @xmath2 ; + - grb  060306 , grb  061021 : for these bursts there were only few optical detections or upper limits so we needed to extrapolate @xmath30 from the closest observation to t = t@xmath28 , assuming @xmath33 = 1.0 ; + - grb  080603b : the last x - ray observation was acquired @xmath25 3.3 hr after the burst . for this event we extrapolated @xmath29 assuming the observed decay slope @xmath34 1.8 ; + - grb  060904a : for this event there is a gap in the xrt data that does not allow us to constrain the value of @xmath2 . using late time data",
    "acquired with the photon counting mode ( pc , mean photon time arrival @xmath35  ks ) we obtain @xmath36=@xmath37 while using the data acquired with the windowed timing mode ( wt , mean photon time arrival @xmath38  ks ) the value is @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , there are no secure optical detections .",
    "therefore , we could only put a conservative upper limit on the value of @xmath30 for this event .",

    "also the xrt observations stop after @xmath250.4 hr with a not well defined decay slope .",
    "this prevented us from estimating @xmath30 , @xmath29 and thus @xmath2 , with good accuracy .",
    "we excluded also this event from our analysis ; + - grb  081221 : as a conservative upper limit for the optical flux at t = t@xmath28 , we considered the only optical detection at @xmath41 hr , having in mind that this value could be contaminated by the host galaxy ( alfonso et al .",
    "2008 ) ; + - grb  090709a : the optical decay of this event is not well defined since the afterglow has been detected in the @xmath31 filter for only three epochs ( guidorzi et al .",
    "2009 , cenko et al .",
    "we extrapolated the optical flux using the observed value of the optical decay ( @xmath42 0.3 ) and we decided to consider this flux as conservative upper limit of @xmath30 ; + - grb  100615a : very conservatively we assumed the observed upper limit at @xmath43  hr ( nicuesa et al .",
    "2010 ) as the upper limit for the optical flux . even assuming the optical flux at such an early time , the @xmath2 remains pretty low ( @xmath25 0.06 ) .",
    "in fact , the nature of this burst has already been analysed and discussed in detail by delia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , showing how this event is indeed a very dark burst .",
    "+ after this analysis we ended up with a total of 55 grbs ( 49 with secure redshift ) for which it was possible to estimate the value ( or an upper limit ) of @xmath2 at the observed time t@xmath28=11 hr post - burst .",
    "for all the grbs in our sample we estimated the optical flux ( @xmath30 ) and the x - rays flux ( @xmath29 ) in the observed frame at a common time t@xmath44  hr .",
