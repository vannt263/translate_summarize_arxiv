    "the study of the exclusive decays in the beauty sector allows one to explore the standard model ( sm ) and search for new physics effects .",
    "the b factory experiments such as babar at slac , belle at kek , lhcb at cern , and b - tev at fermilab make precision tests of the sm and beyond the sm ever more promising .",
    "especially , the @xmath18-meson system becomes a key element in the @xmath19-physics program of b factories ever since the first evidence for @xmath18 production at the @xmath20 was found by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations have made measurements of the charge - parity ( cp ) violating weak @xmath21 mixing phase @xmath22 in @xmath23 decays .",
    "while the sm expectation @xmath24  @xcite is nearly zero , the measured @xmath22 differs from 0 by more than @xmath25 ( but with a sizable error ) .",
    "this measurement of @xmath22 inconsistent with zero ( if confirmed ) would indicate an evidence of new physics .",
    "recently , the belle collaboration also measured the branching ratios of the @xmath23 and @xmath26 decays and the preliminary result  @xcite of the @xmath23 decay is about 3 times larger than that for the @xmath26 decay .",
    "this ratio agrees with a rough estimate obtained within the naive quark model ( neglect octet - singlet mixing ) , where the @xmath27 part of the @xmath28 meson wave function is one third in contrast to the fully @xmath27 content of @xmath29 mesons . with the upcoming chances that a numerous number of @xmath18 mesons will be produced at hadron colliders",
    ", one might explore the exclusive rare @xmath18 decays to @xmath30(and @xmath31 ) ( @xmath1 ) induced by the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath32 . since in the sm",
    "the rare @xmath18 decays are forbidden at tree level and occur at the lowest order only through one - loop penguin diagrams  @xcite , the rare @xmath18 decays are well suited to test the sm and detect new physics effects .",
    "while the experimental tests of exclusive decays are much easier than those of inclusive ones , the theoretical understanding of exlcusive decays is complicated mainly due to the nonperturbative hadronic form factors entered in the long distance nonperturbative contributions .",
    "therefore , a reliable estimate of the hadronic form factors for the exclusive rare @xmath18 decays is very important to make correct predictions within and beyond the sm .",

    "the covariance ( i.e. , frame independence ) of our model has been checked by performing the lf calculation in the @xmath49 frame in parallel with the manifestly covariant calculation using the exactly solvable covariant fermion field theory model in @xmath50 dimensions .",
    "we also found the zero - mode contribution to the form factor @xmath51 and identified  @xcite the zero - mode operator that is convoluted with the initial and final state lf wave functions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend our our lfqm  @xcite to calculate the hadronic form factors , decay rates and the longitudinal lepton polarization asymmetries ( lpas ) for the exclusive rare @xmath52 and @xmath31 decays within the sm .",
    "the lpa , as another parity - violating observable , is an important asymmetry  @xcite and could be measured at hadron colliders such as lhcb . in particular , the @xmath53 channel would be more accessible experimentally than @xmath54- or @xmath55-channels since the lpas in the sm are known to be proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "there are some theoretical approaches to the calculations of the exclusive rare @xmath56  @xcite and @xmath57  @xcite decays , but not the @xmath58 decay mode as far as we know .",

    "2 , the sm operator basis , describing the @xmath59 transitions , is presented . in sec . 3 , we briefly describe the formulation of our lfqm and the procedure of fixing the model parameters using the variational principle for the qcd motivated effective hamiltonian .",
    "we discuss the rare decays between two pseudoscalar mesons using an exactly solvable model based on the covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) model of @xmath50-dimensional fermion field theory and show the equivalence between the results obtained by the manifestly covariant method and the lf method in the @xmath49 frame .",
