    "cepheid variables continue to play an important role in defining the extragalactic distance scale , as demonstrated by the improvements obtained in the past few years in the calibration of far - reaching secondary distance indicators by the hst key project ( @xcite ) and the growing samples of variables with high - quality ground - based light curves located in galaxies of the local group and out to distances of a few mpc ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "continuing efforts are spent to solve some of the pending issues related to sources of potential systematic errors in the distances derived from the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation . among the recent work , we recall the confirmation , based on interferometric data ( @xcite ) , of the @xcite calibration of the infrared surface brigthness technique , which allows to derive accurate geometric distances to cepheids .",
    "this result , together with the availability of excellent near - infrared photometry of cepheids in the lmc , allowed @xcite to exclude a suspected dependence of the slope of the cepheid pl relation on the metallicity of the host galaxy .",
    "systematic uncertainties can affect the extragalactic distances based on cepheids in additional , subtle ways .",
    "the problem of the metallicity dependence of the zero point of the pl relation , for example , has eluded a satisfying solution for a long time , generating controversies on the magnitude and direction of the effect . among the most recent reassessments of the problem",
    "is the work by @xcite , who found that a change in metal abundance by one order of magnitude has an effect on the distance modulus derived from pl relations in the optical @xmath3 and @xmath4 passbands of @xmath6 magnitudes .",
    "blending of cepheids with unresolved projected companions is also a source of concern , because our increasing inability to spatially resolve and account for such companions with increasing distances could lead to systematically underestimate distances to galaxies .",
    "@xcite , followed by @xcite as part of the direct project on m31 and m33 , drew the attention to the effects of blending on the distances to the hst key project galaxies , which have been derived neglecting this effect . by extrapolating the results obtained in the local group galaxies , these authors suggested an upward correction to the distance moduli , exceeding 0.3 magnitudes at 25 mpc , implying that the hubble constant could be overestimated by 5%10% .",
    "these results have been questioned by @xcite and @xcite , on the basis of artificial star experiments and looking for distance - dependent residuals in the tully - fisher relation for the key project galaxies .",
    "a maximum bias due to blending of @xmath7 magnitudes was found .    in the araucaria projectbresolin / araucaria/ ] ( @xcite ) we are endeavoring to obtain accurate cepheid distances to galaxies in the local group and in the sculptor group , and to decrease the uncertainties associated with some of the most important surces of systematic errors .",
    "stellar spectroscopy in the target galaxies provides us with metal abundances of blue supergiants , which complement hii region oxygen abundances , and which are necessary in order to constrain the metallicity dependence of the pl relation .",
    "one of the key target galaxies in the araucaria project is ngc  300 in sculptor . for this galaxy",
    "we have an excellent characterization of both the cepheid ( @xcite ) and the blue supergiant ( @xcite ) populations .",
    "follow - up work allowed us to measure an accurate distance from optical and near - infrared photometry ( @xcite ) and to derive the stellar metal abundance gradient of ngc  300 ( @xcite ) . while we had reasons to believe that blending of cepheids with nearby stars has a negligible impact on our distance to ngc  300 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g04 ) ) , a direct test made on high - resolution hst images was still desirable .",
    "we therefore obtained data with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , with the goal of improving the ground - based photometry of a significant sample of cepheids ( for the blending problem ) and blue supergiants ( for the use of these stars as independent stellar distance indicators , @xcite ) in ngc  300 .    at a distance of @xmath8 mpc , one acs pixel ( 005 )",
    "corresponds to @xmath9 pc .",
    "the hst images discussed in this paper therefore allow us to follow a straightforward empirical approach to test in detail for the presence of projected luminous stars that could affect the photometry of the cepheid variables included in the pl relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we discuss the acs data and the stellar photometry in  2 , and the photometry of the cepheids in particular , together with the comparison with the ground - based light curves , in  3 .",
    "we describe the method adopted to quantify the effects of blending on the cepheid photometry in  4 .",
    "the impact of blending on the cepheid pl relation is presented in  5 .",
    "we briefly discuss and summarize our results in  6 .",
    "we include in the appendix a table with the hst photometry of 40 blue supergiants .",
    "observations of six acs fields in ngc  300 were obtained during hst cycle 11 as part of program go-9492 ( pi : bresolin ) from july 2002 to december 2002 ( see table  [ log ] for a journal of the observations ) .",
    "wide field camera images , approximately 202@xmath10202 on the sky , were obtained through the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters .",
    "the exposure time was 1080 seconds in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , subdivided into three dithered exposures .",
    "four exposures , totalling 1440 seconds , were obtained through @xmath2 .",
    "these exposures were accommodated in two - orbit hst visits for each field .",

    "we updated the periods of cep004 ( from 75.0 to 79.5 days ) and cep007 ( from 43.35 to 43.20 ) , which improved the fit to the ground - based observations .",
    "[ ceph ] shows , we find excellent agreement between the acs data points and the ground - based data in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath13 data indicate the presence of the same offset noticed in the blue supergiant magnitude comparison done in the previous section .",
    "some notable exceptions to the good agreement can also be found , for example cep040 and cep050 , for which the acs magnitudes are systematically fainter in all bands by several tenths of a magnitude .",
    "this is the effect we expect from the presence of unresolved blends in the ground - based data .",
    "close companions to the stars mentioned above are indeed detected on the acs images , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 4cepheids ] .",
    "in order to study the effects of blending on the ground - based p - l relation , we have to consider the contribution to the observed cepheid flux by unresolved projected companions .",
    "the acs images , thanks to their superior spatial resolution , allow us to estimate this contribution , under the assumption that the variables are not further blended in the hst images .",
    "we have adopted a straightforward empirical method to estimate the amount of photometric contamination for the cepheids . for each variable ,",
    "a fourier series analysis has provided a fit to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 light curves .",
    "we have then determined the offset between the acs magnitude and that provided by the fourier fit , calculated at the corresponding phase value .",
    "whenever this difference was smaller than the 1@xmath16 dispersion of the cepheid data points around the fit ( in the range 0.060.13 mag ) , we assigned a zero value for the photometric contamination by blends .",
    "larger offsets resulted in our estimate for the non - zero effect of nearby companions on the ground - based photometry .    in an alternative approach",
    ", we could have measured the total flux contributed by companions , resolved by hst , within a pre - specified distance from the cepheid .",
    "this is the method that was adopted by @xcite as part of the direct project study of the effects of blending in m31 and m33 .",
    "however , the maximum distance from the cepheid that a star needs to have in order to be considered blended with it , around half the typical fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) of the stellar images in the ground - based images , is a somewhat subjective parameter , and can vary between images taken under different observing conditions .",
    "it is also necessary to impose a lower limit to the flux of the stars included in the count , because faint stars resolved by hst would not be measurable from the ground , and would instead contribute to the galaxy background flux . without an _ a priori _ knowledge of all these quantities it would be difficult to obtain a correct estimate of blending .",
    "this is especially true in our case , where observations were diluted over a large temporal interval and were obtained with a variety of telescopes and cameras .",
    "we have chosen to estimate these parameters _ a posteriori _ , once the analysis based on the displacement from the mean light curves had been carried out . we have used the hst photometry of stars around the position of the cepheids to check our results , to verify that no bright companion was unaccounted for , and that we could identify the companions associated with the offsets between the acs and the ground - based photometry .",
    "this procedure also allowed us to resolve a few dubious cases , where the fourier analysis fits provided uncertain results , due for example to a scarcely populated steep ascending branch of the cepheid light curve .",
    "we found that only three out of 16 cepheids required a significant ( i.e.  larger than the uncertainties ) magnitude correction in order to bring the hst and the ground - based photometry into agreement .",
    "although this small fraction might appear surprising at first , we should recall that the cepheids used for the determination of the distance to ngc  300 by g04 ( the source of the ground - based data used in this work ) are among those with the best available characteristics , such as well - defined and clean light curves , and that for the pl relation the most discrepant objects , which are potential blends , are rejected .",
    "cepheids having a mean magnitude brighter than @xmath17 are not affected by blends , i.e.  we find excellent agreement between the hst photometry and the ground - based photometry . the affected objects ( cep040 , cep045 and cep050 ) are among the faintest in our sample , spanning the range of mean magnitudes between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding magnitude offsets are summarized in table  [ blends ] .",
    "we can derive the typical value of the projected distance of neighbors from the cepheids one should use for evaluating their contribution to the flux measured from the ground , in order to reproduce the results obtained with the method described above .",
    "we found that in most cases a distance of 06 is the correct choice , corresponding to approximately half the fwhm of the typical seeing disk of our images .",
    "in addition , we imposed a rather arbitrary lower limit of 5% of the mean cepheid flux for the companions ( to be compared with values between 4% and 6% used by the direct project team ) .",
    "we found that in order to best reproduce the results obtained from the difference hst@xmath20ground at a single epoch , we also had to include only stars brighter than @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which suggests that stars near or below the approximate detection limit of our ground - based observations do not contribute significantly to the blending . without these restrictions on the fluxes , we would obtain in general larger corrections for blending than observed from the direct comparison obtained earlier from the light curves .",
    "however , as we will see in  5 , the final results obtained in this way do not differ substantially from those obtained from the comparison with the light curves .",
    "in fact , the number of neighbors detected is rather small , as can be seen in the color - magnitude diagram of fig .",

    "we can use the results obtained in the previous section to derive the effects that previously unrecognized blends can have on the optical pl relations derived for ngc  300 by g04 .",
    "we proceed as done in that paper , by correcting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 magnitudes for extinction , using @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and assuming @xmath25 ( @xcite ) , although the reddening estimate has been recently increased by the near - ir study of @xcite to @xmath26 .",
    "next , for our scaled - down sample of cepheids we fit linear period - luminosity relations in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the reddening - free @xmath12 wesenheit magnitude @xmath5 [ @xmath27 , both before and after correcting the cepheid average magnitudes by the amounts given in table  [ blends ] . in our linear regression",
    ", we keep the slopes fixed to the ones determined by the ogle  ii project in the lmc ( @xcite ) and adopted by g04 .",
    "we are assuming that the photometric offsets between the hst and ground - based photometry , measured at a single epoch , can be applied to the average magnitudes of the cepheids .    because of the strictly differential nature of this test , differences in the intersect values with respect to those given by g04 for the complete cepheid sample are not important .",
    "for the un - corrected ( blended ) case we obtain :    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30     + the corresponding intersects from g04 are 25.155 ( @xmath31 ) , 24.621 ( @xmath32 ) and 23.802 ( @xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "once we correct for the blending , by making the affected cepheids fainter by the amounts given in table  [ blends ] , we obtain :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36     + these regressions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fit_corr ] , where the open symbols refer to the uncorrected magnitudes , and the full circles represent the corrected values .",
    "the amounts by which the zero points of the period - luminosity relations increase between the uncorrected case and the case where blending has been taken into account are 0.063 mag in @xmath3 , 0.049 mag in @xmath4 and 0.027 mag in @xmath5 . these differences are not statistically significant , being smaller than or comparable to the size of the errors in the determination of the intersects .",
    "generalizing to the full sample of cepheids available in ngc  300 , we conclude that blending does not appear to have an effect on the distance modulus of ngc  300 which is larger than @xmath37 magnitudes .",
    "naturally , it would be desirable to reduce this upper limit even further , but only with the availability of hst photometry for a considerably larger sample of cepheids in ngc  300 we could improve the statistical significance of our result .",
    "our result appears quite robust , and does not depend significantly upon which method is used to estimate the amount of blending . if instead of the adopted offsets obtained from the single - epoch comparison with the light curves we sum the flux of all neighbors projected within 06 of the cepheids , accounting for the 5% cut - off , we obtain similar results as above .",
    "for instance , the variation in the zero point between the uncorrected and the corrected @xmath5 is 0.032 magnitudes , with a 1-@xmath16 error in the mean of 0.048 mag .",
    "the average amount of blending we found in ngc  300 is smaller than what the direct project investigations measured in m31 and m33 .",
    "for example , @xcite found a mean @xmath3-band contribution of 19% of the cepheid flux from unresolved neighbors in their sample of 22 variables in m31 .",
    "an effect of this size would lead to a 9% upward correction on the distance to this galaxy . in m33 ( 64 cepheids with a period larger than 10 days )",
    "@xcite found a 16% mean @xmath3-band blending effect , leading to a correction of 6% on the distance . in ngc  300",
    "the average blending is 7% ( 0% median ) for 16 cepheids , and our estimated upper limit for the effect on the distance is @xmath382% .",
    "if we sum the flux of neighbors within 06 with a 5% cutoff ( to simulate the mochejska et al procedure ) we obtain an 8% average blending ( 6% median ) .",
    "the acs spatial resolution at the distance of ngc  300 ( 0.5 pc ) is comparable to the resolution of the wfpc2 images used by mochejska and collaborators in m31 and m33 .",
    "the reason for the different importance of blending betweeen our study and theirs lies probably in the lower stellar density in the acs fields in ngc  300 compared to those examined in m31 and m33 . as shown by @xcite comparing an inner nicmos field in m101 with an outer one , different amounts of blending are a consequence of varying degrees of crowding and stellar density .",
    "in g04 we quoted a distance modulus @xmath39 .",
    "our estimate for the systematic error was dominated by the uncertainty on the photometric zero points , but did not include a contribution from the uncertainty on the blending . in the discussion presented by g04 we explained why the effects of blending on our sample of cepheids in ngc  300 are likely to be negligible , but we were unable to quantify the size of the effect or to assign an upper limit to it .",
    "our current work based on the hst imaging allows us to constrain the maximum effect of blending , and to add its contribution to the overall error budget .",
    "we conclude that if blending affects the magnitudes of the cepheids included in our period - luminosity relation for ngc  300 , it does so at a small level .",
    "its systematic effect on the distance modulus of this galaxy is limited to less than @xmath40 magnitudes .",
    "our new estimate for the 1-@xmath16 systematic uncertainty in the g04 optical distance modulus to ngc  300 becomes therefore @xmath41 , @xmath42 magnitudes .",
