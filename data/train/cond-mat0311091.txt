    "the krylov subspace gives the mathematical foundation of many numerical algorithms such as the standard conjugate gradient method@xcite and the recursion method@xcite .",

    "now we are planning other molecular dynamics simulations , especially , to metals .",
    "as another fundamental methodology for large - scale calculations , we developed the hybrid scheme within quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is the followings ; the one - body density matrix is decomposed into two partial matrices or subsystems that are constructed from several occupied wave functions .",

    "we use the hybrid scheme between the variational wannier state method and the perturbative wannier state method .    in the continuum theory of fracture",
    "@xcite , a critical crack length is defined by a dimensional analysis between the competitive energy terms of the bulk strain ( 3d ) energy and the surface formation ( 2d ) energy . since the definition of the critical length is independent on the sample size or the lattice constant , we can expect a crossover in fracture phenomena between nanoscale and macroscale samples .",
    "the investigation of the above crossover is one purpose of the present simulation .",
    "another purpose is the fracture behavior in atomistic pictures , on the points of how and why the fracture path is formed and propagates in the crystalline geometry @xcite .",
    "dynamical fracture processes are simulated under external loads in the [ 001 ] direction . as the elementary process in fracture ,",
    "we observe a two - stage surface reconstruction process .",
    "the process contains the drastic change of the wannier states from the bulk ( _ sp_@xmath47 ) bonding state to surface ones .",
    "figure [ fig - anime ] shows a result , in which the fracture propagates anisotropically on the ( 001 ) plane and reconstructed surfaces appear with asymmetric dimers @xcite .",
    "step structures are formed in larger systems so as to reduce the anisotropic surface strain energy within a flat ( 001 ) surface .",
    "such a step formation is understood as the beginning of a crossover between nanoscale and macroscale samples @xcite .",
    "further investigation should be done for direct discussion of the crossover .",
    "the present calculations are carried out using tight - binding hamiltonian within @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals .",
    "we should say that its applicability is rather limited , due to the simplicity of hamiltonian .",
    "its parameter theory , however , reproduces systematically several _ ab initio _",
    "results among different elements or phases , because the tight - binding formulation is universal within the scaled length and energy units @xcite .",
    "an important future work is to construct simple and practical ( tight - binding ) hamiltonians more systematically from the _ ab initio _ theory .",
    "we will use the muffin - tin orbital formulation for the construction , because it gives directly the tight - binding formulation @xcite .",

    "it is also noteworthy that the concept of the generalized wannier state , unlike the conventional one , can be applicable to non - periodic cases .",
