    "if the universe starts with inflation , elementary particles of the universe should be created after inflation .",
    "according to the inflationary theory , reheating after inflation , which converts the vacuum energy into radiation , is responsible for the creation of those particles . at the beginning of that process , inflaton field",
    "is supposed to start oscillation , and then reheating occurs due to particle production caused by the oscillating field .",
    "the oscillation causes production of particles , which interact with each other and finally they come to be in thermal equilibrium . the mechanism of particle production after inflation has been discussed by many authors  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a case in which reheating starts with a regime called preheating  @xcite . in ref.@xcite , assuming a renormalizable interaction , it has been shown that during that period the energy transfer from the inflaton oscillation to other bose fields and particles is extremely efficient . in this paper we are focusing on the initial stage , where preheating occurs and particles are produced .",
    "cosmological evolution of the universe after preheating could be different from the one after perturbative reheating .",
    "in contrast to the generality of the mechanism , the original scenario of preheating is based on renormalizable interaction , which restricts the application of the idea only to the fields that have renormalizable interaction .",
    "therefore , although many theoretical models of particle physics may have fields that do not have renormalizable interaction with inflaton , preheating has been applied only to those `` special '' cases .",
    "although not mandatory , inflationary model may expect amplitude as large as the planck scale  @xcite or the scale of grand unified theory ( gut ) .    before discussing the calculational details , it will be helpful to set out naive questions that may arise when one considers the case .",
    "an important point is that there has been no paper discussing higher dimensional interaction for preheating .",
    "obviously such interaction has been neglected , but the reason is not quite obvious .    1",
    ".   one might claim that large amplitude cancels the suppression of the cutoff . on the other hand",
    ", one might wonder whether such speculation can be applied when particle production occurs near the origin .",
    "2 .   one might think that preheating could be negligible when the coupling is very weak . since higher dimensional interaction is suppressed by the cutoff",
    ", it is usually `` very weak '' compared with renormalizable interaction",
    ". then it could be natural to conclude that higher dimensional interaction is negligible .",
    "in contrast to 1.@xmath0 one might have an intuition that particle production will be trivial and there will be no significant difference from the standard scenario .",
    "then , one might simply assume that only the critical frequency where the infrared instability band ends will change .",
    "also , if one focuses on particle production at the enhanced symmetric point ( esp ) , one might have an impression that preheating might not work since higher dimensional interaction gives @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the scalar field that is supposed to be produced .",
    "this could not be a problem since the adiabatic condition is broken when the inflaton moves a small distance away from the esp , but obviously the situation is not trivial .    in this paper",
    "we carefully consider these naive speculations and intuitions .",
    "we also evaluate numerical coefficients since these coefficients are very important for quantitative estimation of the number density .",
    "they appear in recurrence formula of geometric series .",
    "quantitative calculation of resonant particle production in the expanding universe is not obvious .",
    "this could be in contrast to the transparency of the argument based on the mathieu equation or floquet theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , we considered higher dimensional interaction for a trapping mechanism  @xcite and obtained a result : higher dimensional interaction can cause resonant particle production , and the particles can induce significant trapping force . then , a natural question arises .",
    "`` is the calculation applies to preheating after inflation ?",
    "is the higher dimensional interaction causes resonant particle production when a curvaton or a moduli is oscillating ? ''",
    "this paper aims to gives an answer to those questions .",
    "in this section we carefully review the standard scenario of preheating  @xcite to show which equations have to be modified .",
    "the starting point of the `` standard '' preheating scenario is the lagrangian @xmath3 assuming homogeneous background , classical equation of @xmath4 obeys @xmath5 here @xmath6 is initially negligible if @xmath4-oscillation starts with large amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "then , interaction between the classical field @xmath4 and the quantum scalar field @xmath2 is considered .",
    "one can write the equation for modes with physical momentum @xmath8 in the form @xmath9 this equation describes an oscillator with a frequency @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 is * not time - dependent * ( i.e , when @xmath12 ) , the equation can be written as a mathieu equation with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "mathieu equation gives so - called `` broad resonance '' when @xmath16 .",
    "for very small @xmath4 the change in @xmath17 ceases to be adiabatic .",
    "the standard condition necessary for particle production is @xmath18 therefore , the typical momenta for the resonance is estimated as @xmath19 for @xmath20 , or @xmath21 the maximum @xmath4 is ( which appears when @xmath22 ) @xmath23 thinking about higher dimensional interaction , which ( in the simplest case ) can be written as @xmath24 , it is easy to find that eq.([eq - basic1 ] ) will be replaced by @xmath25 although @xmath26 has been replaced by @xmath27 , floquet theory predicts ( rather naively ) resonance and exponential growth .",
    "therefore , intuitive argument suggests that broad resonance will happen for higher dimensional interaction if the universe is not expanding . on the other hand , quantitative calculation of the resonant particle production in an expanding universe",
    "is not obvious .",
    "our paper aims to find both analytical and numerical estimation of the effect in the expanding universe .",
    "in this section we carefully follow the calculation in ref.@xcite so that the reader can easily compare our result with the usual calculation .",
    "our formulation is carefully prepared so that one can easily figure out why preheating is efficient even though the interaction is higher dimensional .",
    "for that purpose we start with an obvious case using a rather special approximation , which is called `` quadratic approximation '' in this paper .",
    "numerical coefficients are carefully evaluated so that it does not ruin the accuracy of the estimation .",
    "more detailed argument on application to the effective action of gut will be found in ref .",
    "note that our calculation has direct application to those phenomenological models .",
    "our aim in this section is to find an obvious example of higher dimensional interaction that can be examined using the standard method of preheating .",
    "although the approximation is valid only in a very narrow range of the parameter space , the result gives a convincing lower limit of the particle production .",
    "we are going to extend the analysis in the next section , using more rigorous calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "first , consider a model of parametric resonance described by an oscillating field @xmath4 and a particle @xmath2 with the potential and the interaction : @xmath28 around j - th zero crossing at @xmath29 , we assume sinusoidal oscillation @xmath30+i\\mu_j$ ] , which leads to @xmath31 is the amplitude of the oscillation and @xmath32 is the impact parameter ( @xmath33 )",
    ". then one can linearize the interaction using @xmath34\\simeq m_\\phi(t - t_j)\\ll 1 $ ] , and disregard higher terms .",
    "more explicitly , one will find @xmath35 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\mu_j^4 + 2\\mu_j^2 \\phi_j^2m_\\phi^2 ( t - t_j)^2+\\phi_j^4m_\\phi^4(t - t_j)^4+ ... ,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where quartic term ( @xmath36 ) can be neglected when @xmath37 . since the velocity at the bottom of the potential is @xmath38 , the condition @xmath39 is equivalent to @xmath40 . for our estimation",
    "we will take @xmath32 modestly large so that the quadratic approximation will be conceivable . since a large @xmath32 will give an exponential suppression of the number density",
    ", @xmath32 has to be chosen carefully .",
    "our choice of @xmath32 will be discussed in the last part of this section .",
    "explicit form of the higher dimensional interaction term is @xmath41 remember that for a renormalizable coupling ( @xmath42 ) , one will find @xmath43 which does not have the suppression ( @xmath44 ) in front of the effective mass term .    for a flat friedmann background with cosmological scale factor @xmath45 , the equation of motion of the field @xmath46 in fourier space of comoving momentum",
    "@xmath47 is written for @xmath48 as @xmath49 the physical momentum @xmath50 coincides with @xmath47 for minkowski space .",
    "we can eliminate the friction term @xmath51 by defining @xmath52 .",
    "then , one can rewrite the equation in a simpler form @xmath53 where @xmath54 . changing the time variable as @xmath55 , the equation gives @xmath56 where prime denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the equation of motion contains terms proportional to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are included in @xmath63 .",
    "one will see that these terms can be neglected after all , since @xmath64 at subhorizon scales  @xcite .",
    "the remaining term will be @xmath65 .",
    "eq.([basic - eq ] ) can be solved as the well - known problem of wave scattering at a negative parabolic potential , which leads to @xmath66 where the phase @xmath67 causes stochastic growth of the occupation number @xmath68 . according to ref.@xcite",
    ", the stochastic contribution can be averaged to zero after all , since @xmath67 is uniformly distributed .",
    "then one will find the iterative expression for the occupation number @xmath68 as  @xcite @xmath69 since the occupation number becomes large soon after @xmath4 starts oscillation , the equation shows that the mode occupation number @xmath68 increases exponentially as long as the mode satisfies @xmath70 .",
    "although the formalism might look completely the same as the conventional calculation , a significant difference appears in the definition of @xmath71 , which defines the threshold of the particle production .",
    "if the interaction is renormalizable , one will find @xmath72 , while for higher dimensional interaction one will find @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast to the case with @xmath74 , @xmath75 does not vanish at the esp .",
    "let us examine the validity of the above calculation .",
    "the condition that is needed for the quadratic approximation is @xmath76 . at the same time , we need to consider the adiabatic condition ( @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ) , which is violated when non - adiabatic particle production is efficient .",
    "one can rewrite the adiabatic condition as latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "see also eq.(42 ) of ref.@xcite . in units of @xmath186 ,",
    "the effective frequency is @xmath187 .",
    "specific value of @xmath181 is discussed below eq.(14 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "note that we are considering the same oscillation of @xmath188 as ref.@xcite .",
    "then , considering `` only '' the leading term one can recover the mathieu equation , in which @xmath189 can be estimated as @xmath190 .",
    "this estimation is of course not rigorous , but would be useful in finding a sensible estimation . again , as far as the above approximations are valid , perturbative decay from higher dimensional interaction ( @xmath191 ) is not significant compared with preheating .",
    "it is not obvious how fermions interact with @xmath4 , since the source of tiny @xmath192 in the inflationary model is not quite obvious .",
    "even though , it could be possible to consider interaction given by @xmath193 to find that perturbative decay is not significant .    because of fine - tunings of parameters required for inflation ( e.g , @xmath194 or @xmath195 in the above cases ) , it is not quite obvious in reality how inflaton interacts with other fields",
    ". the strength of the specific interaction could depend on the mechanism or the symmetry that makes those parameters fine - tuned . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction considered above ( @xmath160 ) could be mandatory .",
    "although intuitively , the above argument is showing importance of higher dimensional interaction in inflationary cosmology .",
    "in this paper we considered a model of preheating when the oscillation is `` decoupled '' .",
    "even if the oscillation is `` decoupled '' in the effective action , higher dimensional interaction could not be avoidable .",
    "oscillation in such model is normally a decoupled oscillation , which has not been expected to cause efficient preheating .",
    "in contrast to the usual expectation , we found that preheating could be quite efficient for higher dimensional interaction . using three different approaches ( quadratic approximation , steepest descent method  @xcite and numerical calculation )",
    ", we confirmed that higher dimensional interaction can cause resonant particle production . unlike standard scenario of renormalizable preheating ,",
    "the result depends on the ratio @xmath196 .",
    "note that @xmath154 is not excluded as far as the particle production near the esp is well described by the effective action .",
    "the energy transfer is quick if the amplitude of the oscillation is @xmath197 .",
    "let us answer to the `` naive questions '' given in the first section .    1 .",
    "the final result contains @xmath198 , but it is wrong to think that @xmath199 causes suppression around the esp .",
    "again , although the result contains @xmath198 , it is wrong to think that higher dimensional interaction is negligible in preheating .",
    "the function of @xmath68 is different .",
    "rigorous calculation is required to determine numerical coefficients . since there is no exact solution , results have to be backed by numerical calculation .",
    "our result may also indicate that moduli oscillation could cause resonant particle production even if the moduli is decoupled from other particles .",
    "more detailed study including instant preheating ( i.e , when @xmath2 decays during oscillation ) and the curvaton oscillation in thermal environment will be discussed in forthcoming paper .",
