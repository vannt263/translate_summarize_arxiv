    "the set @xmath0 of all such configurations modulo the action of all isometries of @xmath12 is _ the configuration space of the linkage _ @xmath4 .",

    "in @xcite r. connelly , e. demaine , and g. rote proved a strengthened version of the famous carpenter s rule conjecture .",
    "namely , using _ expansive motions _ they showed that @xmath13 is contractible . in the same paper they conjectured that the closure of @xmath13 is also contractible .",
    "we disprove the conjecture by showing that not only @xmath3 can be non - contractible , but can also have other non - trivial homologies . for this",

    "however , authors of @xcite were motivated in their study by a physical model of a linkage which allows self - touching and self - overlapping , but does not allow the edges pass one through another , as it happens in our examples . it remains an open question whether the space becomes contractible if we forbid such passes .    in this respect",
    "we mention two papers @xcite where authors treat the space of _ self - touching configurations _ ,",
    "that is , configurations without transversal crossings .",
    "the authors equip the space by some additional structure which yields an ordering on overlapping edges .",
    "in such a space the contractible loop introduced in section 2 becomes disconnected . in @xcite",
    ", it is proven that the space of self - touching configuration @xmath14 ( equipped with additional structure ) is connected . to the best of our knowledge , nothing is known about contractibility of the space @xmath14 .    however ,",
    "if we forget the additional structure , the set @xmath14 does not coincide with the set @xmath3 : a self - touching configuration does not necessarily belong to @xmath3 , see fig . [",
