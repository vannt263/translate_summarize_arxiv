    "the algorithm will either detect the intersection of the two polygons in step  2 or stops with a terminal arc in step 3.3 .",
    "the algorithm also works in the case when polygon @xmath7 is not necessarily simple .",
    "moreover , the algorithm extends to the case when the first polygonal curve contains the second one , i.e. when we want to separate the unbounded region lying outside the external curve , from the region bounded by the internal curve .",
    "it is easy to observe that the algorithm generalizes also to the case of separation of connected planar straight line graphs .",
    "we say that two graphs are separated by a circle if no edge of the first graph intersects the interior of the circle while no edge of the second graph intersects the exterior of the circle . indeed , in linear time",
