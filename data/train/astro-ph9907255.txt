    "in the past two decades infrared , submillimeter and millimeter observations of galactic molecular clouds illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from nearby stars have revealed strong far - infrared ( fir ) grain continuum emission as well as moderately strong emission from warm gas in the fine - structure lines of [ c  ii ] 158@xmath4 m , [ o  i ] 63@xmath4 m and 145@xmath4 m , [ si  ii ] 35@xmath4 m , and [ c  i ] 370 and 609@xmath4 m , as well as from low-@xmath12 transitions of co. a series of models have been used to interpret these observations ( e.g. , tielens & hollenbach 1985a , hereafter th85 ; van dishoeck & black 1986 , 1988 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; wolfire et al . 1990 , hereafter wth90 ; hollenbach et al .",

    "th85 argued that the observed fine - structure line to dust - continuum flux ratios required a mechanism which was moderately efficient ( @xmath13 ) at converting far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux into atomic and molecular gaseous line emission .",
    "they showed that this condition is satisfied by grain photoelectric heating in the regions where fuv radiation from hot stars impinged on opaque molecular clouds .",
    "th85 dubbed regions where the fuv radiation played a significant role in the heating and/or the chemistry `` photodissociation regions '' ( pdrs ) , and they showed that the emission from such regions could be primarily parameterized by the cloud density , @xmath14 , and the strength of the fuv ( @xmath15ev@xmath16ev ) radiation field , @xmath17 illuminating the cloud ( where @xmath2 is in units of the `` habing field '' , @xmath18 ) .",
    "in particular , wth90 showed that far - infrared observations of pdrs would be extremely useful in determining the physical properties of these regions .",
    "pdrs are the origin of much of the infrared radiation from the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the incident starlight is absorbed by dust grains and large carbon molecules ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or pahs ) and reradiated primarily as pah infrared features and infrared continuum radiation .",
    "as much as 0.1 - 1% of the absorbed starlight , however , is converted to gas heating via photoelectric ejection of electrons from grains .",
    "the gas generally attains a higher temperature than the grains because of the much less efficient cooling of the gas ( often via [ c  ii ] 158@xmath4 m and [ o  i ] 63@xmath4 m emission ) relative to the radiative dust continuum cooling , and inefficient coupling between gas and grains means that the gas and grains remain at different temperatures .",
    "much of the [ c  ii ] and [ si  ii ] and most of the [ o  i ] , [ c  i ] and co rotational emission from the milky way galaxy arises from pdrs .",
    "pdrs include all the neutral gas in the ism where fuv photons dominate a significant aspect of the chemistry and/or heating .",
    "traditionally , pdrs have been associated with atomic gas . however , with the above definition , pdrs also include material in which the hydrogen is molecular and the carbon is mostly in co , but where fuv flux still strongly affects the chemistry of oxygen and carbon not locked in co ( photodissociating oh , o@xmath19 and h@xmath19o , for example ) and affects the ionization fraction as well . the transition from h to h@xmath19 and from c@xmath20",
    "to co occurs in pdrs . with the exception of the molecular gas in dense",
    ", star - forming cores , most molecular gas in the galaxy is found at a@xmath21 in giant molecular clouds where fuv radiation still plays an important role ( wolfire , hollenbach & tielens , 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , neutral diffuse clouds ( @xmath22 ) , translucent clouds ( @xmath23 ) , as well as 90% of molecular clouds ( @xmath24 ) are pdr gas - thus , most of the ism is in pdrs .    in addition , the warm neutral medium ( @xmath25 ) of the galaxy ( c.f .",
    "mckee & ostriker 1977 ; wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) , the neutral gas around planetary nebulae , and photodissociated winds from red giant or agb stars are pdrs .",
    "densities in pdrs range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and incident fuv fluxes range from @xmath28 ( the interstellar radiation field ) to @xmath29 ( the field @xmath30pc from an o star ) .",
    "we treat the range @xmath31 and @xmath32 in this paper .",
    "comparison of observations with our models not only provide a diagnostic of @xmath14 , @xmath33 and @xmath2 from the emitting regions , but also constrain the metallicity , the geometry , the dust properties and ( for regions smaller than the beam ) the cloud or clump properties such as the size , volume and area filling factors , and number of clouds or clumps in the beam .    as in galactic sources , observations of pdrs in external galaxies",
    "show that the fine structure lines of [ c  ii ] and [ o  i ] generally dominate the global gas cooling ( e.g. , stacey et al . 1991 ; madden et al .",
    "1993 ; carral et al . 1994 ; poglitsch et al . 1995 ; lord et al . 1997 ) , but [ c  i ] and co emission lines from well - shielded pdr gas can also contribute significantly ( e.g. , bttgenbach et al .",
    "1992 ; white et al . 1994 ; stutzki et al .",
    "the measured strengths of especially the [ c  ii ] and [ o  i ] lines and the fir continuum , when compared to pdr models , can provide effective diagnostics of the typical conditions in extragalactic interstellar media ( e.g. , wth90 , carral et al .",
    "1994 ; lord et al .",
    "1997 ) . in galaxies , however , the derived physical parameters are uncertain to the extent that media other than opaque pdrs can contribute to the line emission .",
    "for example , shock - heated media may contribute significantly to the [ oi ] 63 @xmath4 m emission ( draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ; hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) , as observed in the starburst galaxy ngc 6240 ( lord et al .",
    "1997 ; luhman et al .",
    "likewise , the extended low - density cold neutral component of the ism ( which is a non - opaque or diffuse pdr ) may dominate the large - scale [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath4 m emission , as suggested by madden et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the galaxy ngc 6946 .",
    "furthermore , diffuse hii regions may dominate the production of [ si  ii ] or [ c  ii ] in some galaxies ( lord et al . 1994 ; lord et al .",
    "1996 ; heiles 1997 ) .",
    "new and upcoming infrared and submillimeter airborne and space - based platforms and sensitive detectors / receivers are greatly enhancing the sensitivity of extragalactic pdr observations . as a result ,",
    "the number and variety of observed extragalactic pdrs continue to grow , posing increasingly more complicated challenges to theoretical pdr models . for instance , recent [ c  ii ] and [ o  i ] fir spectra of normal ( lord et al .",
    "1996 ; malhotra et al .",
    "1997 ) and starburst ( fischer et al . 1996 ; satyapal et al . 1999 ) galaxies obtained with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) reveal pdr gas that is generally typical of that found in other galactic and extragalactic pdrs , where the ratio of [ c  ii ] to fir flux is @xmath34 @xmath35 ( stacey et al .",
    "however , for some sources such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( luhman et al .",
    "1998 ; fischer et al .",
    "1999 ) and a few normal galaxies ( malhotra et al .",
    "1997 ) , iso data indicate extremely low [ c  ii]/fir ratios @xmath36 . such low ratios may indicate that the sources of the grain heating are not ob stars , but are objects which radiate considerable bolometric luminosity in bands outside the fuv ; or these ratios may indicate unusually high ratios of @xmath37 , which result in a dramatic decrease in the grain photoelectric heating of the gas because of the increase of positive grain charge ( c.f . ",
    "conversely , in dwarf irregular galaxies , [ c  ii]/fir is much higher than in the galaxy ( e.g. , [ c  ii]/fir@xmath341% in the large magellanic cloud ; poglitsch et al . 1995",
    "; israel et al . 1996 ; pak et al . 1998 ) perhaps due to the lower metallicities and lower dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "the paucity of dust that characterizes low metallicity galaxies increases the penetration depth of photodissociating uv photons and produces clouds with reduced - sized co cores surrounded by larger pdrs , as evidenced by high ratios of [ c  ii ] to co ( poglitsch et al .",
    "1995 ; israel et al . 1996 ; madden et al . 1997 ) .",
    "likewise , recent sensitive ast / ro observations of [ c  i ] in the lmc show that the extent of [ c  i ] emission , created by the photodissociation of co , is also enhanced ( stark et al .",
    "we note that such metal - deficient galaxies are not good candidates for the standard conversion of co intensity to h@xmath19 mass ( maloney & black 1988 ; sakamoto 1996 ) .",
    "several authors have constructed pdr models appropriate to the magellanic clouds , with particular emphasis on the c@xmath20/c / co transition ( maloney & black 1988 ; van dishoeck & black 1988 ; lequeux et al . 1994 ; maloney & wolfire 1997 ; pak et al .",
    "these studies demonstrate that in order to match the observed pdr line emission from metal - deficient systems such as the magellanic clouds , low - abundance models specific to the environment are required .",
    "wth90 presented especially useful contour plots of the fine - structure emission and line ratios predicted by their pdr models as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "several recent developments motivate us to update the calculations presented by wth90 . from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "many of the important physical parameters which effect the calculation of emissions from pdrs ( e.g. collision strengths , chemical rate coefficients , photoelectric heating rates ) have been revised in recent years , in some cases by orders of magnitude , so that we might expect the predictions of these models to change considerably .",
    "we extend the work of wth90 to include a larger parameter space for @xmath14 and @xmath2 , and to include a study of the effects of changing the metallicity and geometry .",
    "we also include results for a wider variety of predicted diagnostic lines ( e.g. [ c  i ] and co ) . from an observational standpoint , results from recent , existing , and future observatories will be used to study galactic and extragalactic pdrs in greater detail than ever before .",
    "these include the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) ; the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( sofia ) [ nasa s planned successor to the _ kuiper airborne observatory _ ( kao ) ] , which will be used to study far - infrared sources with unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution ; the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ) and the odin telescope , which will be used to observe the sky in submillimeter transitions of ci , o@xmath19 , h@xmath19o and co ; and the _ far infrared and submillimeter telescope _ ( first ) , which will be used to study a wide range of galactic and extragalactic phenomena over a broad spectral range .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in  2 we discuss the relevant details of our pdr model .",
    "we concentrate on the important differences between our present calculations and previous studies by our group .",
    "recent observational work has led us to select a new set of atomic abundances , while recent theoretical work has led to improvements in our understanding of several important reaction and heating rates , and we discuss these and other important differences .",
    "in  3 we present a series of contour plots of line strengths and line ratios of important atomic and molecular cooling species .",
    "we divide an opaque pdr into a warmer surface region ( @xmath38 ) and a cooler , more molecular interior ( @xmath39 ) . in  3.1 and  3.2",
    "we focus on emission from the surface regions and present surface temperatures as well as line strengths and line ratios of several important far - infrared cooling lines including the [ c  ii ] 158@xmath4 m line , and the [ o  i ] 63@xmath4 m and 145@xmath4 m lines .",
    "we also compare the strengths of these transitions with the integrated far - infrared continuum intensity expected from pdrs .",
    "this line - to - continuum ratio provides a measure of the efficiency with which stellar photons are converted to gas heating in pdrs . in ",
    "3.3 we concentrate on the interior part of the pdr where longer wavelength tracers originate : the neutral carbon transitions at 609@xmath4 m and 370@xmath4 m , as well as several millimeter and submillimeter transitions of carbon monoxide .    in  4",
    ", we discuss how changes in the assumed metallicity and in the model geometry can affect our results .",
    "we briefly describe our procedure ( wth90 ) for deriving the average physical parameters of an ensemble of pdrs when large beams are used to study distant ( e.g. extragalactic ) interstellar media .",
    "our procedure for applying our results to ensembles of clouds is relevant for the interpretation of the far infrared , millimeter and submillimeter observations of , for instance , the nuclei of starburst galaxies which exhibit metallicities close to solar , as well as the magellenic clouds or other irregular galaxies which show reduced metallicities .",
    "these results are applied to the starburst galaxy m82 , the normal spiral galaxy ngc 278 , and to the large magellenic cloud .",
    "the basis for our new modeling effort is the pdr model of th85 and htt91 , which computes a simultaneous solution for the chemistry , radiative transfer , and thermal balance in pdrs . assuming gas phase elemental abundances and grain properties , each model is essentially described by a constant density of h nuclei , @xmath14 , throughout the pdr and the intensity of the far - ultraviolet radiation field at the pdr surface , @xmath2 .",
    "these models have been used in the past to show how the structure of a molecular cloud varies with increasing optical depth . th85 and htt91 described the general morphology of the surface layers for typical ratios @xmath40 , as is often the case : an outer layer ( @xmath23 ) of atomic h , c@xmath20 and o , a central layer where the h makes the transition to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and where c@xmath20 becomes c and then co ( @xmath43 ) , and an inner layer ( @xmath44 ) where the oxygen not incorporated into co is still mainly in atomic o. at larger depths , we leave the pdr and enter the very opaque molecular cores where the chemistry and heating are dominated by cosmic rays .",
    "we list here the standard input parameters for the model results presented in the contour plots of the following section .",
    "the input parameters are : the micro - turbulent velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath45 ; the gas - phase elemental abundances ; the dust abundances , including those of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) which generally dominate the grain - photoelectric heating ; the gas density , @xmath14 ; and the strength of the incident fuv field , @xmath2 .",
    "our model clouds are assumed to be pressure supported with a microturbulent doppler line width of @xmath46 @xmath47 ; this value of the line width is taken from observational studies of fine - structure and co line widths ( e.g. hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) and is appropriate for the majority of cases which we consider .",
    "this value of @xmath45 is low for cases of high @xmath2 and high for cases of low @xmath2 , but variation of this parameter by factors of @xmath482 has little effect on the calculated line strengths ( wolfire , hollenbach & tielens 1989 ) .",
    "we use the cool diffuse cloud gas phase abundances from savage & sembach ( 1996 ) for our standard model . in  4 , we discuss the effects of changes in these gas - phase abundances .",
    "we assume the same grain fuv absorption characteristics as used in th85 and htt91 , but we modify the grain photoelectric heating rates and the formation rate of @xmath41 on grains , as described below .",
    "with these parameters fixed , our study covers the range @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the standard input parameters .    besides changing the standard gas phase abundances ( note in particular the decrease in the gas phase carbon abundance in table 1 from the value used in wth90 )",
    ", we have made a number of changes to the chemical , heating and cooling rate coefficients as compared with th85 , wth90 and htt91 .",

    "( 1990 ) , who found in many cases a significant initial rise in gas temperature with cloud depth , we find that the inclusion of pah heating leads to a relatively constant pdr gas temperature from the cloud surface to a depth where either the heating or cooling changes significantly and the temperature drops . the heating is generally dominated by the grain photoelectric effect , and this changes primarily when dust attenuation significantly lowers the fuv flux , at @xmath71 or a column density @xmath72 .",
    "collisional deexcitation of fuv - pumped @xmath41 can dominate the heating in cases of high @xmath73 _ and _ high @xmath74 .",
    "the cooling changes when the primarily atomic ( h , c@xmath20 and o ) surface becomes molecular ( h@xmath19 or co ) at depths of @xmath75 for @xmath76 ( such that dust shields the molecules from dissociating radiation ) or at smaller column densities for @xmath77 ( such that self - shielding by h@xmath19 and co becomes dominant ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the pdr surface temperature , @xmath78 , as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath14 . in general",
    ", @xmath78 rises with @xmath2 as would be expected since grain photoelectric heating dominates and the fuv flux is the source of the heating .",
    "there is an exception to this rule for very high fluxes , @xmath79 , and very low gas densities [ @xmath80 , where the grains become so positively charged due to the fuv flux that increasing @xmath2 actually decreases the net heating .",
    "this heating drop stems from the poor heating efficiency of ejecting electrons from positively charged dust grains and increased rate of recombination cooling with the grains .",
    "however , as we discuss below , the results in this corner of parameter space are not realistic since the model does not take into account grain drift through the gas due to radiation pressure , which becomes important in this region . fortunately , there are not many astrophysical regions which correspond to the upper - left quadrant of our @xmath81 parameter space .",
    "the behavior of @xmath78 with density is somewhat more complicated . at low densities ( @xmath82 ) ,",
    "the temperature drops for increasing @xmath14 at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior arises because the cooling is generally dominated by the [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath4 m and [ o  i ] 63 @xmath4 m transitions whose critical densities lie at @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "thus the cooling rate per unit volume increases with @xmath85 in the low density regime , whereas the grain photoelectric heating increases with a lower density dependence .",

    "in addition , as the gas phase electron density increases , the grains become less positively charged .",
    "the diminished charge leads to a larger fraction of photoelectrons which escape the grains and increases the kinetic energy which they supply to the gas . the total density dependence for grain heating , however , is less than the @xmath85 dependence of cooling . at moderate densities ( @xmath87 ) , [ o  i ] and [ c  ii ] attain lte ,",
    "the cooling rate per unit volume is proportional to @xmath14 , and the heating rate increases faster than the cooling rate . here",
    ", @xmath78 increases with increasing @xmath14 at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "because the interstellar cooling curve is relatively flat as a function of @xmath33 for @xmath88 ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) , the temperature rapidly rises with @xmath14 in this regime ( @xmath89 ) to thousands of degrees , where coolants such as [ o  i ] 6300  can become important and balance the heating .",
    "finally , at very high densities ( @xmath90 ) , and especially for @xmath91 , the temperature again declines with @xmath14 . here",
    "the grains have become neutral so that the heating rate per unit volume due to grains is just proportional to @xmath14 ( or the grain density ) , whereas the cooling increases somewhat more rapidly with @xmath14 because of the presence of additional coolants such as [ o  i ] 6300   and gas collisions with cold dust grains , whose efficiencies go as @xmath85 , in addition to the lte coolants [ o  i ] 63@xmath4 m and [ c  ii ] 158@xmath4 m whose efficiencies go as @xmath14 .      in this section we present results for the strengths of several important far - infrared tracers of photodissociation regions .",
    "the emission is produced primarily in the outer regions of the uv illuminated clouds , where @xmath64 and co are photodissociated and cooling is dominated by neutral species and by singly ionized species whose ionization potentials are less than 13.6 ev .",
    "it is this outer region where the temperature contour plot ( fig .",
    "1 ) applies and where the pdr line cooling occurs through the [ c  ii ] and [ o  i ] transitions .    in figure 2 , we show schematically the various regimes which determine the relative strengths of the principal coolants of pdrs : the [ c  ii ] 158@xmath4 m transition and the [ o  i ] 63@xmath4 m transition . above the line marked `` @xmath92 '' radiation pressure drives grains through the gas at velocities greater than the assumed average turbulent velocities ( @xmath93 ) in the gas .",

    "they do find that this transition occurs nearer the pdr surface for plane - parallel models than for spherical models in low column density cases , an effect which is smaller than 20% for the cases they present .",
    "since the co line is generally optically thick and is relatively insensitive to temperature , we expect that our simplified calculation will give results within a factor of 1.5 larger than a detailed spherical model .",
    "our results are shown in figure 19 for @xmath244 and in figure 20 for @xmath246 moving to the right along the x - axis in these figures is equivalent to increasing the total visual extinction ( labelled on top ) or total cloud hydrogen column density ( labelled on bottom ) to the center of the spherical cloud .",

    "at very low visual extinctions , the ratio is small since the co is photodissociated more effectively than the @xmath41 .",
    "as we move to higher total visual extinction , the ratio @xmath236/m_{\\rm h_2}$ ] drops near @xmath251 ( for high ratios of @xmath37 where dust controls the @xmath252 dissociation front ) as molecular hydrogen begins to form but co is still photodissociated .",
    "as co becomes the dominant carbon bearing species ( @xmath208 ) , the ratio again begins to rise . in the case of low @xmath2 , the ratio eventually drops as we move to higher total @xmath207 since co is optically thick near the surface and @xmath233 $ ] roughly scales with cloud area ( or @xmath253 for fixed @xmath14 ) while @xmath235 scales with volume ( or @xmath254 for fixed @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore the ratio of the two declines as @xmath207 ( and cloud radius ) gets larger . in the case of very high fuv field",
    "( @xmath255 ) , the co photospheric radius is appreciably smaller than the @xmath41 radius even when @xmath11 .",
    "the co photospheric area therefore increases faster than the @xmath41 volume and the ratio continues to rise as @xmath207 increases from 3 to 10 .",
    "lowering the metallicity to @xmath211 but fixing @xmath207 leads to a smaller ratio since the volume ( mass ) of the molecular gas is increased relative to the area of the co photosphere ( c.f .",
    "figure 20 ) .",
    "the ratio is also a strong function of density between @xmath256 and @xmath257 , due in part to chemical effects and in part to the fact that the critical density for this transition is @xmath258 ( c.f .",
    "table 2 ) .",
    "the main points illustrated in figures 19 and 20 are the following .",
    "the @xmath214(co @xmath5)/@xmath259(h@xmath19 ) ratio varies over many orders of magnitude for clouds of low @xmath229 . even if all clouds have the same ( high ) value @xmath260 , there are still order of magnitude changes in the ratio as @xmath3 and @xmath14 vary .",
    "the drop of @xmath3410 in the ratio as @xmath3 drops from 1 to 0.1 is primarily due to the increased size of the clouds , which changes the volume ( @xmath34h@xmath19 mass ) by a factor of 10 more than it changes the co photospheric area ( @xmath34@xmath214[co ] ) . for @xmath11 ,",
    "a drop in @xmath3 from 1 to 0.1 increases the radius of a cloud by a factor 10 , increasing the h@xmath19 mass by a factor of @xmath128 but only increasing the area of the co photosphere by a factor of @xmath261 . for virialized clouds , as the ratio @xmath262 increases by a factor of 100 ,",
    "the turbulent doppler velocity @xmath263 should also increase by a factor 10 .",
    "wolfire , hollenbach & tielens ( 1989 ) showed that variations of @xmath263 by a factor 2 had little effect on the line intensities , but this larger increase in velocity dispersion might have a significant effect on the intensity of the co @xmath5 line ; we have not included this effect in our models .",
    "the @xmath214(co @xmath5)/@xmath259(h@xmath19 ) ratio also drops by about an order of magnitude for fixed @xmath3 as @xmath14 decreases from @xmath250 to @xmath264 , primarily due to subthermal excitation of co. however , the ratio is quite insensitive to large variations ( over 3 orders of magnitude ) in @xmath2 .",

    "we mention several cautionary notes when applying our theoretical models to these types of observations and further outline the additional analysis which can be carried out for extragalactic sources .",
    "first note that the observed line width measures the dispersion velocity of pdrs ( clouds ) within the beam rather than the turbulent gas velocity , @xmath45 , within a single pdr .",
    "thus , the appropriate @xmath45 to use for extragalactic observations is of the order a few @xmath47 as adopted in this paper and @xmath45 is not the much larger velocity width of the emission line .",
    "second , the observed peak line intensity depends on the intensity emitted by each cloud and the beam filling factor at the central velocity .",
    "it is important , therefore , to correct as best as possible for the different area filling factors for various species .",
    "for example , diffuse [ c  ii ] emission may fill the beam whereas [ o  i ] emission may arise from a smaller , high @xmath14 and high @xmath33 region . in such a case",
    "it would not be appropriate to take the ratio of observed fluxes f([c  ii])/f([o  i ] ) for use in the contour plots presented in this paper .",

    "the density , temperature , and incident fuv field derived from the observations are necessarily an ensemble average of the pdrs in the beam .",
    "wth90 analyzed the bias in the derived quantities and found that the method is somewhat biased toward the high density , high @xmath2 regions .",
    "a third caution is that some portion of the diagnostic line emission , in particular that of [ c  ii ] , may arise from non - pdr gas such as from low density hii regions or a diffuse warm ionized component .",
    "this emission should be subtracted before using the contour plots .",
    "one method for estimating this emission is to rely on hii region modeling as presented , for example , in carral et al .",

    "carral et al .",
    "estimated that 30% of the [ c  ii ] emission in ngc 253 originates in hii regions .",
    "another method may be used when [ n  ii ] emission is observed , as the [ c  ii ] emission from low density hii regions scales with [ n  ii ] ( heiles 1994 ) .",

    "( 1994 ) can be carried out to determine additional characteristics of the interstellar medium .",
    "the first step is to determine the mass of neutral pdr gas from the observed [ c  ii ] line intensity and the derived gas temperature and density from observations of [ c  ii ] , [ o  i ] and the fir continuum flux from the warm dust in the pdrs .",
    "if co observations are available , then estimates can be made of the molecular gas mass , the area and volume filling factor of the clouds , and the number and radii of clouds .",
    "the last step is to evaluate the source of fuv radiation as being consistent with a distribution of stars or a central source , and whether the absorbing clouds are correlated in space with the fuv source(s ) .",
    "we will not repeat the steps here and the reader should refer to the original papers for details ; however , a few points should be noted in applying the updated models .",
    "note that the [ c  ii ] cooling plot shown in wth90 ( fig .",
    "4 ) is acceptable for use with the current models with the reduced gas phase carbon abundance .",
    "this is because the plot shows the cooling per c@xmath20   atom as opposed to the cooling per hydrogen nucleus and thus it remains unchanged for present models .",

    "( 1995 ) observed 30 doradus in the lmc with a 1@xmath338 beam ( @xmath34 15 pc at the lmc ) and found [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath4 m , co @xmath5 and fir continuum intensities of @xmath339 , @xmath340 and 0.7 erg s@xmath63 @xmath274 sr@xmath63 , respectively .",
    "these results give @xmath154[c  ii]/@xmath154(fir)=@xmath341 and @xmath154[co]/@xmath154(fir ) = @xmath342 .",
    "these values are indicated with a large ` * x * ' in figures 16 and 17 .",
    "the figures show that the observations may be matched either by : high extinction ( @xmath11 ) clouds with moderate densities and fuv fields ( @xmath343 ) but with @xmath344 so that the area of co emitting gas is effectively decreased relative to the area of [ c  ii ] emitting gas ; or by lower extinction ( @xmath345 ) gas illuminated with @xmath346 with equal densities ( @xmath266 ) in the co and [ c  ii ] emitting regions , which again tends to lower the ratio of co - to-[c  ii ] emitting areas .",
    "if the co and [ c  ii ] emitting regions have the same density , then our results from figure 17 allow us to constrain the implied value of the ratio @xmath347$]/m(h@xmath19 ) . for low metallicity , @xmath266 , and @xmath348 , and taking @xmath345 , figure 20 shows that the ratio has a value of @xmath349 , a factor of @xmath350 smaller than the standard ratio .",
    "this low ratio implies that the mass of clouds in the lmc is larger by this factor than the standard ratio would give . using this conversion factor",
    ", we can calculate the mass of h@xmath19 in the 1   beam from the observed co intensity .",
    "if we assume that typical gmcs are @xmath3415 pc in size , then the 1   beam contains a single gmc .",
    "we find a mass m(h@xmath351 , more than an order of magnitude too high for a 15 pc cloud to be gravitationally stable .",
    "this seems to rule out our @xmath220 model , so we conclude that the @xmath11 model with a density contrast between the co and [ c  ii ] emitting regions is far more likely .",
    "the @xmath11 model is consistent with the mckee ( 1989 ) model of photo - ionization regulated star formation which predicts that @xmath207 remains constant even as @xmath3 changes .",
    "we have modeled the emission from photodissociation regions using the pdr code of th85 , but updated through the use of the most up to date values of atomic and molecular data , chemical rate coefficients , and grain photoelectric heating rates .",
    "we find that the new grain heating terms produce the largest differences between our results and earlier results of our group .",
    "we have presented contour plots showing the line intensity and/or intensity ratios for the pdr diagnostic lines [ c  ii ] 158@xmath4 m , [ o  i ] 63@xmath4 m and 145@xmath4 m , [ c  i ] 370@xmath4 m and 609@xmath4 m , co @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as the strength of the fir continuum .",
    "the contour plots cover a large range of density and incident fuv flux , including conditions relevant to diffuse galactic pdr emission , the surfaces of gmcs exposed to the average interstellar field , planetary nebulae , reflection nebulae and pdrs lying outside dense hii regions around o and b stars .",
    "these plots can be used to derive the gas density @xmath14 , incident fuv flux @xmath2 , and gas temperature @xmath33 in pdr regions from observations of line fluxes .",
    "we have explored the effects of metallicity , cloud geometry and visual extinction on the [ c  ii]/fir and co @xmath5/fir intensity ratios .",
    "we find that reducing the metallicity in a cloud of fixed @xmath207 ( @xmath34 10 ) has little effect on the [ c  ii]/co line ratio except in the parameter regime @xmath352 , where the [ c  ii]/co ratio increases with decreasing @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "16 ) . for translucent clouds ( @xmath353 )",
    "changes in metallicity have a more pronounced effect than in the @xmath354 case ( see fig .",
    "17 and 18 ) .",
    "we find that reducing the @xmath207 of a cloud greatly increases the observed [ c  ii]/co line ratio .",
    "therefore , reducing the metallicity in a cloud of given total hydrogen column density increases this ratio . increasing the density of the co  emitting gas relative to that of the [ c  ii]emitting gas in an unresolved",
    "spherical cloud produces an increase in this ratio as well , because the area of the co photosphere ( and consequently the co luminosity ) is reduced .",
    "we have applied our results to recent observations of the central @xmath34500 pc of the starburst galaxy m82 . using the cloud ensemble technique from wth90 together with our new model results , we find that the core of m82 contains clouds with the following average properties : gas density , @xmath266 ; fuv flux , @xmath280 ; surface temperature , @xmath290  k ; total mass of atomic gas in all the cloud surfaces , @xmath355 ; number of molecular clouds , @xmath302 ; cloud mass , @xmath356 ; and cloud radii , @xmath357  pc .",
    "these clouds have masses akin to gmcs in the galaxy , though they are denser and at pressures of order 1001000 times that of local gmcs . our derived values for the gas densities of these clouds and the mean incident fuv flux are similar to prevously determined values .",
    "on the other hand , for emission over @xmath344 kpc of the spiral galaxy ngc 278 , we find typical values of : @xmath358 ; @xmath326 ; @xmath359  k ; @xmath360 ; @xmath332 ; @xmath361 ; and @xmath362  pc .",
    "the lower values of @xmath14 and @xmath2 are expected since we are averaging over a greater volume of the galaxy and because ngc 278 is not a starburst galaxy like m82 .",
    "we find that the recently observed high [ c  ii]/co ratio in the 30 doradus region of the lmc can be explained by either a lower @xmath207 ( @xmath345 ) in the typical clouds compared with clouds in the milky way galaxy ( @xmath354 ) , or by a higher density in the co emitting cloud cores compared with the [ c  ii ] halos . in either case ,",
    "the column of hydrogen nuclei through the typical clouds is greater than the columns through milky way molecular clouds .",
    "if the [ c  ii]/co ratio in 30 doradus is caused by @xmath345 clouds , then the co - to - h2 conversion factor for these clouds is reduced by a factor of as much as @xmath363 compared to milky way clouds .",
    "this ratio gives an h@xmath19 mass for gmcs in the lmc an order of magnitude too high for the clouds to be gravitationally stable , and so we rule out low @xmath207 clouds as an explanation for the high [ c  ii]/co ratio .",
    "instead , we find it more likely that these gmcs have @xmath11 , consistent with the mckee ( 1989 ) model of photo - ionization regulated star formation which predicts that @xmath207 remains constant even as @xmath3 changes .",
