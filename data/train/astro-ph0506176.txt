    "smmj14011 + 0252 ( hereafter smmj14011 ) is a bright submillimeter ( submm ) source identified in the field of the cluster lens , a1835 , by ivison et al .",
    "( 2000 , i00 ) ( see also smail et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the submm source has a radio counterpart , allowing the position of the submm emission to be pin - pointed to a close pair of blue galaxies .",
    "the redshift of the system was measured as @xmath2 from a near - infrared spectrum by i00 , and both components were confirmed to lie at the same redshift from optical spectroscopy by barger et al .",
    "molecular co emission was subsequently identified at this redshift by frayer et al .",
    "these observations appeared to show that the @xmath0 system is a massive , gas - rich far - infrared luminous source , only the second such system identified from submm surveys ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "smmj14011 has become a archetype for submm galaxies , being studied extensively by a number of authors ( ivison et al .",
    "2001 , i01 ; downes & solomon 2003 , ds03 ; tecza et al .",
    "2004 , t04 ; frayer et al .  2004 ; swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ; motohara et al .",
    "2005 , m05 ; carilli et al.2005 ) . from the outset",
    "it had been assumed that smmj14011 was gravitationally amplified by the potential of the foreground cluster , by a factor of @xmath3@xmath4 ( i00 ; frayer et al .",
    "however , ds03 suggested that in fact the submm source is highly amplified by a superimposed , foreground galaxy  resulting in j1 and j2 being two images of a single background source , with an amplification of a factor of @xmath530 ( see also m05 ) .",
    "this scenario results in very different conclusions about the intrinsic properties of smmj14011 and would mean that the source is not representative of the mjy - submm population , which are the subject of much research .    in this paper",
    "we reassess the available multiwavelength information on smmj14011 to determine the likely influence of gravitational lensing on the measured properties of this galaxy .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , giving an angular scale of 3.88kpc and 8.15kpc per arcsec .  at @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "we show a variety of different views of smmj14011 in fig .  1 and mark on the main components following the naming scheme of m05 . from ground - based optical imaging",
    "it is clear that the system is made up of two main components : j1 and j2 ( i00 ) .",
    "j1 and j2 are both relatively blue , compared to the bright early - type galaxies in the foreground cluster ( i00 )",
    ". however , higher resolution optical imaging from _ hubble space telescope _ ( i01 ) identifies several knots within j1 ",
    "j1a / j1b / j1d in fig .  1 , which appear superimposed on the relatively smooth and regular underlying component j1c .",
    "while high - resolution ground - based near - infrared imaging highlights a low - surface brightness , very red extension to the north of j1 , which terminates in a faint knot , j1n ( i01 ; frayer et al .",
    "the morphology of the redshifted h@xmath10 emission from the @xmath0 galaxy has been mapped using both narrow - band imaging ( swinbank et al.2004 ) and integral field spectroscopy ( t04 ) .",
    "these observations show that the h@xmath10 emission is seen from the knots j1a / j1b / j1d and the @xmath11-long , very red extension out to j1n ( fig .  1 )  but not from j1c .",
    "the exact position of the submm , molecular gas and radio emission relative to the optical imaging remains somewhat uncertain . aligning the _ hst _ image to the radio reference frame using the five radio sources with bright optical counterparts ( but not smmj14011 ) yields a position for j1c of 140104.96 + 025224.1 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of @xmath12 ( consistent with the published position from i01 ) .",
    "we plot the centroids and 1-@xmath13 error - circles for the co(43 ) and co(76 ) emission from ds03 and our 1.4-ghz centroid on fig .  1 .",
    "within the relative uncertainties the radio position could be associated with j1d or the near - infrared peak next to it , although the co peaks are both somewhat south of this position .         a detailed inspection of the optical spectrum of j1 from barger et al.(1999 ) , suggests that it comprises a mix of light from a uv - bright starburst at @xmath0 and a foreground galaxy as proposed by ds03 . to isolate the light from the foreground galaxy we scale and subtract the spectrum of a high - redshift starburst ( j2 ) from the spectrum of j1 .",
    "the scaling factor is chosen so that the absorption features around @xmath14  are not highly negative in the resulting spectrum .",
    "the difference spectrum is shown in fig .  2 and exhibits a number of absorption features which are identifiable as balmer h@xmath15 [ 4743.3  observed wavelength ] , ca h [ 4912.0 ] , ca k [ 4956.8 ] , h@xmath16 [ 5126.7 ] , g - band [ 5375.8 ] and h@xmath17 [ 6069.3 ] at @xmath18 .",
    "thus it appears that there is light from a foreground member galaxy of the a1835 cluster mixed with that from the @xmath0 system in our spectroscopic slit .",
    "the identification of this foreground component is hampered by an unfortunate coincidence that some of the absorption lines in the @xmath1 galaxy can be interpreted as uv features at the redshift of the background source , e.g.  cii1335 corresponds to 4743.3  and siiv1394 falls close to 4956.8 .",
    "the lack of any detectable emission lines from the @xmath1 component in the j1 spectrum ( e.g.  [ oii]3727 , [ oiii]5007 ) , along with the apparent strength of the balmer absorption lines ( ew(h@xmath19 ) suggest that the superimposed galaxy could either be a passive galaxy or potentially a post - starburst system ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , we caution that the strength of these features is strongly dependent on the relative contributions from the foreground and background components in the spectrum , which is not well - determined .",
    "thus we confirm the suggestion by ds03 that one component of j1 is a foreground galaxy .",
    "looking at the morphologies of the various components in fig .",
    "1 , it seems most likely that j1c corresponds to the @xmath1 galaxy .    to gain a clearer view of the morphology and luminosity of j1c we take advantage of its apparent regularity and symmetry to remove the superimposed knots of emission",
    "we rotate the _ hst _ image of smmj14011 by 180degrees and subtract it from itself  producing an image of just the knots of emission : j1a / j1b / j1d and j2 .",
    "these can then in turn be subtracted from smmj14011 to leave just the emission from j1c .",
    "this shows the restframe @xmath20-band structure of the galaxy  with a smooth , circular morphology indicative of a spheroid or face - on early - type disk .",
    "the measured ellipticity of j1c is @xmath21 ( at pa=133deg . ) and its total magnitude ( within a 6@xmath22-diameter aperture ) is @xmath23 ( our best estimate of the @xmath24-band magnitude of j1c is @xmath25 , giving a color of @xmath26 , similar to that expected for a dwarf spheroid or early - type disk cluster member , smith et al .  2002 ) .",
    "using gim-2d ( simard et al .",
    "2002 ) we model the 2-d light distribution in j1c and obtain a best fit model ( @xmath27 ) with a half - light radius of @xmath28 or @xmath29kpc and a bulge - to - disk ratio of @xmath30 , suggesting the galaxy is an early - type disk ( sab ) .",
    "the apparent magnitude of j1c corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath31 at @xmath1 , or roughly 0.1@xmath32 . assuming the galaxy follows the faber - jackson relation measured in moderate redshift clusters ( e.g.  zeigler et al .",
    "2001 ) , we would expect a velocity dispersion for the galaxy of @xmath33kms@xmath9 given its absolute magnitude ( the error is the 1-@xmath13 scatter of galaxies around the faber - jackson relation ) .",
    "we quote this value as a limit due to the possibility that the mass - to - light ratio of j1c is higher than typical passive galaxies in the cluster if it has suffered recent star - formation .",
    "the low velocity dispersion we infer for this galaxy is consistent with the small half - light radius we measure if it follows the scaling ratios for early - type cluster galaxies at @xmath34 .",
    "thus we conclude that j1c is a passive , early - type dwarf disk galaxy member of a1835 .     the spectrum of j1c obtained by subtracting a @xmath0 lyman - break galaxy ( a scaled version of the j2 spectrum ) from the published j1 spectrum of barger et al .",
    "the spectrum shown in bold is the smoothed difference spectrum , while the upper and lower traces show the spectra of component j1 and j2 respectively ( offset for clarity )",
    ". the difference spectrum represents the light from the @xmath1 galaxy , j1c .",
    "we mark some of the stronger spectral features visible in the foreground galaxy spectrum and we note that j1c contributes roughly half the light observed at 5000  in the spectrograph slit .",
    "we also use take advantage of the very different @xmath35 colors of j1c and the red - extension , j1n ( i01 ; frayer et al .",
    "2004 ) to scale the j - band emission of j1c and subtract it from the k - band image to leave a clear view of the k - band morphology of the high - redshift galaxy , fig .  1 .",
    "this unsurprisingly matches the h@xmath10 morphology from t04 , given the strong contribution from the h@xmath10 line in the k - band ( i00 ; t04 ; swinbank et al .  2004 ; m05 ) .",
    "however , we can use the good resolution of the keck imaging ( 0.4@xmath22 fwhm ) to show that this emission is resolved in both axes with a seeing - corrected size of @xmath36 .",
    "two strong lensing models have been proposed for smmj14011 based on the identification of various components of the system as multiple images of single background sources .",
    "ds03 discuss a toy model which seeks to explain j1a / j1b / j1n and j2 as four images of a single background source .",
    "although they do not construct a rigorous model they suggest that a potential well associated with j1c with a velocity dispersion of @xmath37kms@xmath9 , along with a contribution from the cluster mass distribution , could fit the four proposed images .    as shown by swinbank et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and t04 , the spectroscopic information available for j1a / j1b / j1n and j2 indicates different redshifts for the two systems from their h@xmath10 emission ( e.g.fig .  1 ) .",
    "this rules out j2 as a counter image and hence allows us to discard the qualitative model suggested by ds03 .",
    "m05 also fit a strong - lensing model to components of j1  this time j1a , j1b and j1d  using the gravlens model of keeton ( 2001 ) .",
    "their model includes an external shear field arising from the cluster potential ( constrained by the mass model of schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ) and is capable of reproducing the positions of the three proposed images using a highly - elliptical ( @xmath38 , pa@xmath39deg . ) potential well centered on j1c with a velocity dispersion of @xmath40kms@xmath9 .",
    "the obvious problem with the m05 s lens model is that the parameters of the potential well of j1c differ substantially from those traced by the light distribution within this galaxy on similar scales .",
    "the ellipticity , position angle and likely velocity dispersion of the halo are all strongly at odds with those measured or expected for j1c ( @xmath41 , pa@xmath42deg .",
    "and @xmath43kms@xmath9 ) if mass traces light on @xmath44kpc scales within this galaxy in a similar manner to that found from modelling strong and weak lensing by individual galaxies ( treu & koopman 2004 ; kochanek et al.2000 ; natarajan et al .",
    "in particular , we note that the velocity dispersion required in this model would correspond to a galaxy with an absolute magnitude of @xmath45 , some @xmath46 brighter than j1c ( assuming the @xmath34 faber - jackson relation from zeigler et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in addition , we find that the predicted flux ratios between j1a / j1b of 11:13 are at odds with the measured 1.0@xmath22 aperture magnitudes from the _ hst _ image of @xmath47 and 23.91 ( with uncertainties of @xmath48 , j1d has @xmath49 in the same aperture ) .",
    "these yield a flux ratio between j1a and j1b of @xmath50 , compared to the predicted ratio of 1.18 .",
    "all of these discrepencies arise because of the incorrect identification of j1a / j1b / j1d as three images of a single background source .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that there is no compelling similarity between the morphologies of j1a , j1b and j1d : j1b is well resolved , with a fwhm of 0.57@xmath22 , while j1a is more compact ( fwhm=0.30@xmath22 ) and j1d is too faint to allow us to measure a reliable size .",
    "the observed properties of the various components of smmj14011 do not appear to _ require _ a strong - lensing interpretation .",
    "however gravitational magnification due to the known mass concentrations along our line - of - sight to smmj14011 , i.e.  j1c and a1835 , inevitably modify its observed properties .",
    "we quantify this effect , first considering the magnifying power of j1c alone . adopting 55kms@xmath9 as the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion of j1c , and a simple singular isothermal model ( @xmath51kms@xmath52kms@xmath9 ) ,",
    "the einstein radius of j1c is just @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the observed separation of j1a / j1b from j1c is @xmath54 . to achieve an einstein radius comparable with the observed separation , j1c would require a velocity dispersion of @xmath55kms@xmath9 ( as concluded by m05 ) , implying an anomolously high mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we now consider to what extent the contribution from the cluster potential can ameliorate this situation using the lenstool lens modelling code ( kneib et al .  1993 , 1996 ; smith et al .",
    "2005 , s05 ) .",
    "the schmidt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass model for the cluster adopted by m05 uses ground - based optical photometry of selected arcs and the cluster s x - ray emission to constrain a model of the cluster mass distribution .",
    "however , _ hst _",
    "imaging now reveals one of the multiple - image systems ( b and b@xmath56 ) employed in their modelling by schmidt et al .  to be unreliable ( s05 ) .",
    "we therefore instead use the gravitational lens model developed using _ hst _ wfpc2 imaging by s05 to describe the mass distribution within the cluster .",
    "we refer the interested reader to s05 for full details of the model .",
    "the key features relevant to this study are ( i ) despite the presence of several gravitational arcs in a1835 , none of them have been spectroscopically identified to date ( s05 ) , hence the model is constrained by the weak shear signal detected in the outskirts of the wfpc2 frame , ( ii ) this weak shear signal was calibrated to 10% precision in projected mass using spectroscopically - confirmed strong - lensing clusters at the same redshift as a1835 , ( iii ) the family of acceptable models ( defined by @xmath57 ) bracket schmidt et al.s models .    taking our best - fit mass model for a1835",
    "we can now add a mass component at the position of j1c with ellipticity , position angle and velocity dispersion matching our estimated values (  2.2 ) .",
    "the surface mass density of the combined a1835+j1c lens is sub - critical at the position of j1a / j1b / j1d , i.e.  the combined lens is not capable of multiple - imaging at the location of the submm emission .",
    "the same is true of models at the high and low - mass extremes allowed by the weak - shear data and the observational constraints on j1c . in summary",
    ", we estimate a conservative 1-@xmath13 range for the amplification of the various components of : j1a @xmath584.9 ; j1b @xmath594.1 ; j1d @xmath594.0 ; j1n @xmath593.9 ; j2 @xmath605.0 ; the uncertainties are driven by the statistical error from the weak - shear constraints on a1835 .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is unlikely that smmj14011 is strongly lensed , instead the different observed components are likely magnified by factors of @xmath615 .",
    "our analysis confirms the suggestion of ds03 that a component of the complex submm source , smmj14011 , is actually a foreground galaxy .",
    "however , we do not support their suggestion that the background far - infrared luminous source is multiply - imaged and hence highly - amplified by the foreground galaxy ( in combination with the a1835 cluster ) .",
    "there is clear spectroscopic evidence which rejects their proposed identification for the multiple images .",
    "similarly , we have used the measured properties of the foreground galaxy , j1c , to reject a second lensing configuration suggested by m05 .",
    "both the observed ellipticity and estimated mass of the halo of j1c are very different from those required by m05 s model , while the flux ratios and morphologies of the proposed counter - images also do not agree with their predictions .",
    "we suggest that j1c is probably a passive dwarf member of the a1835 galaxy cluster .",
    "our best estimates of the likely velocity dispersion of this galaxy , @xmath62kms@xmath9 , indicate it is incapable of producing multiples images on the observed angular scales of j1a / j1b / j1d .",
    "instead , we estimate a modest boosting of the amplification of these images , over that provided by the cluster alone . assuming that the submm emission broadly traces the h@xmath10 emission mapped by t04 gives a median amplification averaged over the source of @xmath63 , slightly higher than the original estimate assumed by i00 based purely on the lensing influence of the cluster potential .",
    "thus smmj14011 has an intrinsic submm flux of @xmath64mjy at 850@xmath65 m and a far - infrared luminosity of @xmath66 .",
    "smmj14011 is an intrinsically luminous galaxy ( smail et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to study the structure of the background galaxy in more detail we can correct its observed shape ( as displayed in the @xmath67 image in fig .",
    "1 ) for the distortion produced by the lens using our model .",
    "this indicates that the source is likely to have an intrinsic fwhm of @xmath68 ( 4kpc ) and has a relatively circular morphology in the restframe optical ( perhaps corresponding to a face - on orientation , which would help explain the relatively narrow co line width for the system , ds03 ) .",
    "the knots , j1a / j1b / j1d / j1n , visible in the _ hst _ imaging appear to be uv - bright clumps lying in a @xmath44kpc region corresponding to the restframe optical extent of the galaxy and are most likely relatively unobscured star - forming regions within the galaxy .",
    "j2 represents a uv - bright companion with a separation of just @xmath69kpc in projection .",
    "the close proximity of j2 to j1 suggests that their dynamical interaction may be responsible for the intense starburst currently underway in j1 . the size and",
    "clumpy / multi - component morphology of smmj14011 is thus very similar to that of typical submm galaxies with submm fluxes of @xmath70mjy ( chapman et al .",
    "2004 ; smail et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we conclude that the intrinsic nature of smmj14011 is much as originally stated by i00 , at least regarding the long - wavelength properties ( where j1c does not contribute ) .",
    "however , the identification of j1c as a foreground contaminant with only a weak lensing contribution does alter the conclusions of ds03 and m05 who both adopted strong - lensing models to correct the observed properties of smmj14011 . using our prefered lens model",
    ", we reinterpret the apparent co(76 ) size of smmj14011 from ds03 , who constrain the source to be @xmath71 ( corrected for the beam ) , which corrected for lens amplification indicates an intrinsic co(76 ) fwhm of @xmath72kpc .",
    "this makes the co emission in smmj14011 comparable in size to the few smgs studied at high - resolution with iram ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ; tacconi et al .",
    "the discussion in ds03 then suggests that the source must plausibly consist of a series of compact knots distributed within the beam if the brightness temperature is not going to be too high .    in the case of m05 , the main conclusion which changes as a result of our lens model",
    "is the estimated stellar mass of the system , which instead of being @xmath73m@xmath74 ( adopting an amplification of @xmath75 ) , should be closer to @xmath76m@xmath74 , comparable to the gas mass and dynamical mass limits derived from the co line width ( frayer et al .",
    "again this makes the restframe optically - derived stellar mass of smmj14011 very similar to that of comparably luminous submm galaxies in the field ( smail et al .",
    "2004 ) , although we caution that these stellar mass estimates are highly uncertain due to the large extinction correction and sensitivity to the adopted ages and hence mass - to - light ratios of the stellar populations ( borys et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we note that the identification of j1c as a foreground galaxy will also alter the model of the near - infrared spectral energy distribution of this system derived from high - quality 2-dimensional spectroscopy by t04 .",
    "they attempt to reproduce an apparent spectral break between the @xmath77- and @xmath78-bands with the balmer discontinuity in a young stellar population and derive a rough age of 200myrs and a reddening of @xmath79 from this . from the observed @xmath24-band magnitude of j1c",
    ", we estimate that roughly half of the light in the @xmath24-band spectrum of t04 comes from the foreground galaxy and adopting reasonable near - infrared colors of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for this galaxy ( assuming an unevolved early - type spectral energy distribution at @xmath1 ) , that the true spectral break is likely to be stronger when the contribution from j1c is removed .",
    "this would likely decrease both the age and the reddening derived by t04  bringing these closer to the values determined by m05 .",
    "however , we stress that t04 s analysis of the baryonic mass of this system relies on the spectral rather than photometric properties of this system and hence is insensitive to the exact properties of j1c .",
    "our analysis of the spectral properties of j1c , a proposed component of the @xmath0 submm source smmj14011 , confirms that it is in fact a dwarf early - type member of the foreground cluster .",
    "however , our detailed modelling of the gravitational lensing contribution from j1c on the background submm source indicates that it is unlikely to significantly increase the amplification of the source over that from the cluster potential alone .",
    "we estimate conservative limits on the amplification of the various uv / near - infrared components of smmj14011 in the range @xmath825 . we conclude that smmj14011 remains an intrinsically very luminous galaxy with properties that appear similar to comparably",

    "<S> we discuss the properties of the bright submillimeter source smmj14011 + 0252 at @xmath0 which lies behind the central regions of the @xmath1 lensing cluster a1835 . </S>",
    "<S> this system has a complex optical morphology consisting of at least five separate components . </S>",
    "<S> we reassess the extensive multiwavelength observations of this system and find strong support for the suggestion that one of these five components represents a foreground galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral and morphological properties of the foreground galaxy indicate that it is a low - luminosity , passive early - type disk member of the a1835 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the likely properties of the dark matter halo of this galaxy from its stellar distribution . based on these estimates </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that , contrary to earlier claims , this foreground galaxy is unlikely to significantly magnify the background submillimeter source . </S>",
    "<S> thus smmj14011 + 0252 probably represents an intrinsically luminous submillimeter galaxy . </S>"
