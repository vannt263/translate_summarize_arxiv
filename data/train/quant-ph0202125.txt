    "recent years have seen significant experimental advances in manipulation of quantum states in a variety of physical systems .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest that these experiments have with regard to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics , they suggest that a high degree of control and coherence in simple quantum systems can be achieved , perhaps eventually sufficient to implement a useful quantum computation @xcite in an assembly of such individual units ( qubits ) .    unlike a classical computer ,",
    "in which the only source of errors is uncontrolled transitions between the states , a quantum computation is sensitive also to random changes in _ phases _ of the basis states .",
    "such changes occur due to interaction of the qubit with the environment .",
    "they are referred to as decoherence , and the time scale over which the phase will drift by an amount of order one is referred to as decoherence time @xmath0 . it is advantageous to make @xmath0 or , more precisely , the ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the switching time , as large as possible .    in many cases , the basic operations on qubits ( quantum gates ) can be approximated as evolution of certain two - level systems under an external influence ( a pulse of voltage , current , etc . ) . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on cases when the environment is comprised by interacting oscillators , described for brevity by a single real scalar field @xmath3 , and the interaction of the two - level system with the environment is linear , with the hamiltonian of the form can be studied in a similar way . ]",
    "= - d^3 x j ( , t ) ( , t ) .",
    "[ hint ] in addition to @xmath4 , the hamiltonian of the environment contains the free hamiltonian @xmath5 and a hamiltonian @xmath6 , the latter describing nonlinear interactions among the oscillators themselves .",
    "our method is sufficiently general to include fully interacting oscillator environments , i.e. any reasonable form of @xmath6 .",
    "one motivation for doing so is the possibility to consider environments that are near phase transitions ( or the vestiges of such in finite systems ) .",
    "the `` current '' @xmath7 depends on the state of the two - level system and represents its switching history .",
    "this current , of course , does not have to be the usual electric current , although it may coincide with it in some specific cases of interactions .",
    "for example , in a persistent current qubit @xcite , where the basis states differ by the value of the electric current , @xmath8 can indeed be interpreted as the current density , and @xmath3 as a component of the electromagnetic field .",
    "an important example , where ( [ hint ] ) applies but @xmath8 is unrelated to electric current , is the swap gate based on two coupled quantum dots .",
    "key features of this gate are as follows .",
    "there is an electronic spin 1/2 associated with each dot .",
    "these spins are coupled to each other through an exchange interaction , and the interaction hamiltonian is given by the energy of the singlet - triplet splitting .",
    "the exchange interaction can be switched on and off by varying the potential barrier between the dots ; the latter is controlled by gate voltage @xmath9 , which can be viewed as a sum of some average voltage @xmath10 and a fluctuation @xmath11 .",
    "then , the singlet - triplet splitting energy can be written as e_t - s(v ) e_t - s(|v ) + v .",
    "[ hdot ] the first term contributes to the hamiltonian of the qubit , while the second term describes the interaction of the qubit with the environment .",
    "we see that this second term is precisely of the form ( [ hint ] ) , with @xmath12 playing the role of the `` current '' , and @xmath11 the role of the environment . for the case",
    "when fluctuations of @xmath9 are the usual thermal ( nyquist ) fluctuations , decoherence induced by @xmath11 was considered previously in ref . .",
    "the splitting energy @xmath13 is substantial only during a pulse of voltage that temporarily lowers the potential barrier .",
    "thus , the duration of the pulse is the switching time of the gate . from ( [ hdot ] )",
    ", we see that in this particular case the duration of the pulse also determines the duration of the interaction between the qubit and the environment .",
    "whenever ( [ hint ] ) applies , the evolution of the field @xmath3 from a known initial state is completely determined by the current @xmath7 , i.e. the switching history .",
    "in other words , the gate in this case works as an antenna , producing a definite `` radiation '' state of @xmath3 .",
    "( again , this `` radiation '' does not have to be an electromagnetic wave , but can be any kind of propagating excitation . )",
    "decoherence can be associated with the probability to emit or absorb a nonzero number of quanta of @xmath3 .",
    "typically , the initial state of @xmath3 is taken to be a thermal state , with probabilities of different energy levels given by the canonical distribution at some temperature @xmath14 . in this paper , we want to deviate from this practice and consider a microcanonical initial state , in which the oscillators are constrained to have their total energy equal to some @xmath15 . will be set to zero at the initial moment , which can always be done by a time - independent redefinition of @xmath3 .",
    "this makes choosing a microcanonical initial state for the bath equivalent to choosing it for the entire qubit+bath system .",
    "] there are several reasons why we think that this problem is interesting and potentially important for analysis of various qubit designs .",
    "first , in thermodynamics we are accustomed to canonical and microcanonical ensembles being essentially equivalent in the macroscopic limit .",
    "it is interesting to see if , and to what accuracy , the same applies to calculations of quantum coherence , which is an intrinsically time - dependent quantity .",
    "second , some of the environments important for current qubit designs are in fact comprised by relatively few degrees of freedom .",
    "consider , for example , the swap gate described by eq .",
    "( [ hdot ] ) , and suppose that the pulse of voltage is delivered to the gate via a transmission line .",
    "suppose further that the line is open at one end ( where it attaches to the gate ) and closed at the other ( and the pulse is obtained , say , through inductive coupling of the line to some control circuit ) . for a line of length @xmath16 ,",
    "the number of modes significantly populated at temperature @xmath14 is of order n_eff ~ .",
    "[ n ] for @xmath17 m and @xmath18 k , we obtain @xmath19 . at this point",
    ", it is actually not obvious that this @xmath20 , i.e. the number of populated modes , is what controls the transition to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , later in the paper we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "now , although an ensemble of identical oscillators baths contained in identical experimental apparata may be well described by a thermal density matrix , in each individual experiment the bath initially has nearly fixed energy , with some broadening due to the initial state s preparation .",
    "if the broadening is larger than the level spacing of the bath but smaller than the typical energy fluctuation in a thermal state , the microcanonical initial state is a better approximation than the canonical one . because the level spacing decreases exponentially with the size of the bath",
    ", while relative thermal fluctuations only go as inverse square root of @xmath20 , we expect that such a situation will in fact be typical for relatively small , `` mesoscopic '' environments . in this case",
    ", one may wonder how much the microcanonical decoherence , induced by the interaction of the qubit with the bath , differs from the thermal ( canonical ) result .",
    "in particular , one of the main goals of our project was to see if such a small environment can cause any significant decoherence at all .    finally , because decoherence is associated with the response of the environment to changes in the system",
    ", one may expect that anomalously large deviations from the thermal result will occur when fluctuations in the environment are large and the relaxation is slow , e.g. near a critical point .",
    "our calculation lends some supports to this idea .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "( i ) if , for a microcanonical state of energy @xmath15 , we formally define temperature @xmath14 by the usual thermodynamic formula , then the expansion parameter that controls the difference between the canonical and microcanonical results for decoherence is @xmath21 , where by definition @xmath22 . for a one - dimensional transmission line ,",
    "this is of the same order as eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) .",
    "( ii ) we consider an expansion of microcanonical decoherence in powers of @xmath21 and find that the leading difference between the canonical and microcanonical results is formally of order @xmath21 .",
    "we present both a general formula for this correction , applicable for any nonlinear environment , and an explicit formula for an environment with ohmic dissipation .",
    "in particular , for the case of a transmission line we find that already for @xmath19 the environment causes significant decoherence , which is practically indistinguishable from the thermal result .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath21 correction contains a term proportional to the derivative of the heat capacity of the environment with respect to the temperature , @xmath23 , which becomes singular near a critical point .",
    "although in a finite system there can be no `` true '' critical singularity , a finite enhancement of @xmath23 remains .",
    "it is significant in this respect that our results apply to the general case of a fully nonlinear environment , rather than to a collection of harmonic oscillators , for which no critical phenomena are expected .",
    "a simple application of finite - size scaling shows that the critical singularity of @xmath23 alone can not completely cancel the @xmath21 suppression factor ( although it can reduce the suppression considerably ) .",
    "however , the correction also depends on the dissipative coefficient , characterizing the interactions of the qubit with the environment , and it is ultimately the critical behavior of this coefficient that determines both the size and the sign of the correction at a critical point .    in summary , while our results are somewhat inconclusive on the critical behavior of decoherence ( due to the lack of understanding of the critical behavior of the dissipative coefficient ) , we obtain a clear demonstration that away from criticality even a relatively compact , `` mesoscopic '' bath of oscillators , initially in a microcanonical state , induces decoherence of practically the same magnitude as a truly macroscopic , thermal environment .    in the course of the evolution , the qubit and the bath exchange energy , as described by the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "moreover , because the qubit itself is controlled by some external means , even the compound qubit+bath system is not strictly isolated ( except at times before and after the switching ) .",
    "we assume , however , that there is no additional , `` direct '' interaction of the bath with the outside world .",
    "this seems to us a reasonable assumption , since in most cases one will want to isolate the qubit and its immediate surroundings from the larger room - temperature environment .    our work ,",
    "then , has some elements in common with the earlier work of jensen and shankar @xcite on a strictly isolated small system .",
    "these authors have observed statistical behavior in a numerical solution of the schrdinger equation for seven interacting spins . in particular , they have found that the distribution of probabilities for one spin in their system closely resembles the canonical distribution expected if the full spin chain were in a microcanonical state . in the present context ,",
    "the selected spin plays the role of the qubit ( albeit not subject to any external control ) , while the remaining spins play the role of the bath .    apart from the question of perfect versus imperfect isolation of the compound qubit+bath system , the main difference between the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and ours is that @xcite compares results for a pure initial state to those for a microcanonical ensemble , for a compound system , while we are interested in comparing results between canonical and microcanonical initial states for such a system . as we will see , that latter comparison can be done , for a rather general case , without a recourse to numerical integrations",
    "instead , our calculation makes use of a steepest - descent evaluation of an integral relating the canonical and microcanonical averages , the accuracy of this procedure being again controlled by @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present the definition of coherence as a functional of the switching history , the latter being represented by the current in ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "we discuss a suitable form of the current .",
    "although our main results are not based on a perturbative expansion of coherence , we pause in sect . 3 to describe a convenient way to perform such an expansion , based on the coherent - state formalism . in sect .",
    "4 , we compute coherence , as defined in sect .",
    "2 , for a thermal initial state and recover some familiar expressions . in sect . 5",
    ", we construct the density matrix for a microcanonical initial state . in sect .",
    "6 , we compute microcanonical decoherence .",
    "7 is a conclusion .    in what follows we use the system of units with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if we know that at some initial time @xmath26 , the environment started out in a definite quantum state @xmath27 , we can define coherence remaining in the qubit at arbitrary time @xmath28 in the following way .",
    "find the final state of the environment using the evolution operator @xmath29 , where the `` current '' @xmath8 represents the switching history of the qubit .",
    "coherence equals the overlap of that final with the state that would obtain if no switching took place : c(t ) = ( 0 ) | u_0^(t,0 ) u_j(t,0 )    to the divergence of the evolution histories of the environment corresponding to different histories of the qubit .",
    "it therefore reflects the measuring influence that the environment had on the qubit .",
    "an obvious extension of this definition to the case when the state at @xmath26 is a mixed state with a density matrix @xmath30 is c(t ) = tr .",
    "[ coh2 ]    it is convenient to incorporate the moments of time @xmath31 and @xmath28 in the definition of the current . to save notation",
    ", we describe the environment by a single real scalar @xmath32 with real - valued oscillator modes @xmath33 : ( , t ) = _ n _ n(t ) _ n ( ) ( generalizations are of course possible ) .",
    "we assume that each mode couples to some smooth @xmath34 , which is zero at @xmath35 , switches on at @xmath36 , stays on a plateau until @xmath37 , and then switches off , see fig .",
    "1 . thus , the lagrangian of the field is l = _ n \\ { _ n^2 - _ n^2 _ n^2 + j_n _ n } + l_int [ ] , [ l ] where @xmath38 describes a self - interaction .",
    "the above form of the current can describe either of the following two experimental setups . for the swap gate described by the hamiltonian ( [ hdot ] ) , the profile shown in fig .",
    "1 represents a single gate operation : both the initial and final states of the qubit correspond to @xmath39 .",
    "so , the switching time of the qubit is the entire time @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one basis state of the qubit corresponds to @xmath39 , and another to the plateau value @xmath40 , then the current of fig .",
    "1 represents two switching operations : from the first state to the second and back . in this case , the switching time is the ramp time of the current , @xmath41 . )",
    "coincides in this case with what is perhaps a more familiar definition : the value at time @xmath28 of the off - diagonal element of the _ qubit s _ density matrix , relative to its value at @xmath26 ; @xmath42 acts as a frequency cutoff . ]    for this form of the current , we can relate @xmath30 to the density matrix at some @xmath43 in the distant past as ( 0 ) = u_j(0,t_i ) ( t_i ) u_0^(0,t_i ) [ rho0 ] ( since at @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 coincide ) and also extend @xmath28 in ( [ coh2 ] ) to some @xmath47 in the distant future . in this way",

    "theory , it can be computed order by order with the help of the schwinger - keldysh diagram technique .    if we are to have small decoherence , it is natural to assume that the currents @xmath52 are weak .",

    "the real and imaginary parts of the thermal @xmath56 are given by ( [ qr ] ) , ( [ qi ] ) .",
    "let us compare the magnitudes of different terms in the exponent of ( [ cxi ] ) on the saddle point @xmath98 with @xmath78 determined from ( [ esp ] ) .",

    "( [ explicit ] ) ) it grows with @xmath28 ( the time for which @xmath52 is on ) and at large @xmath28 can in principle become a large correction .",
    "however , for applications to qubits , we are interested only in cases when @xmath123 $ ] , i.e. decoherence accumulated during time @xmath28 , is much smaller than one . in these cases , corrections to the thermal result remain formally suppressed by @xmath124 .",
    "let us calculate the first of these corrections .",
    "the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ cxi ] ) can be written as f [ , j ] = -ie+ z(-i ) - q [ , j ] f_0 ( ) - q [ , j ] .",
    "[ fxi ] here , @xmath125 $ ] has a saddle point at @xmath98 , found in the previous section .",
    "the corresponding saddle point of the full @xmath126 $ ] is shifted to = i + , [ xi_sp ] with a small @xmath127 . treating @xmath113 $ ] in ( [ fxi ] ) as a perturbation , we find = , [ delta ] where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath93 ( so that @xmath127 is in general complex ) .",
    "note that @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the heat capacity given by ( [ cv ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath130 .",
    "the saddle - point calculation that led to eq .",
    "( [ zsp ] ) in the previous section is now modified in two ways .",
    "first , both the extra term in ( [ fxi ] ) and the shift of the saddle point contribute to the saddle - point exponent .",
    "second , they also modify the second derivative of @xmath131 , which determines the preexponent . as a result , to the leading order in @xmath132",
    ", we obtain c(t ) = \\ { 1 + ( ) } \\ { - q[i , j ] - } , [ cmicro ] where subscripts following commas are used to denote derivatives with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "the correction to the exponent is always negative , since @xmath133 .",
    "note , however , that although the corrections to both the exponent and preexponent are of the same order in @xmath132 , the first is also @xmath134 , while the second is @xmath135 .",
    "thus , in the most interesting to us limit of weak decoherence , the correction to the preexponent is more important .",
    "in fact , for an interacting environment , we are not really allowed to keep the correction in the exponent , since the higher - order terms in @xmath56 , due to the self - interaction , can give rise to corrections of the same order , cf .",
    "( [ qgen ] ) .",
    "we nevertheless retain this correction in ( [ cmicro ] ) ( and in ( [ cohmic ] ) below ) because of the traditional interest in linear environments , for which it is the main @xmath134 correction .    as an example , let us take a look at eq .",
    "( [ cmicro ] ) for the case of ohmic dissipation .",
    "we specialize further to the large-@xmath28 limit , @xmath136 , so we can use for @xmath137 $ ] the large-@xmath28 limit of the thermal expression ( [ explicit ] ) : q_r[i , j ] = , [ large - t ] while @xmath138 , which is not bose - enhanced , can be neglected .",
    "we find c(t ) = \\ { 1 + ( ) } \\ { - - } , [ cohmic ] where @xmath139 is the temperature .",
    "the correction to the preexponent , which is the main correction in the limit 1 t / 1/ [ limit ] is negative whenever @xmath140 is a growing function of @xmath14 .",
    "that is the case , for example , for linear environments with acoustic dispersion laws , such as those considered in the previous section .",
    "however , as we discuss in the conclusion , there are interesting cases when @xmath141 , and it is in principle possible to have a positive correction to coherence .    for the transmission line considered in the previous section , @xmath142 , so that @xmath143 , while @xmath89 is @xmath14-independent . then , the preexponent in ( [ cohmic ] ) is equal to @xmath144 , which should be compared to @xmath145 , the expansion of the exponent in the limit ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "we see that already for @xmath146 , the correction to the thermal result is only 2.5% .",
    "our main result is the calculation of a correction to the thermal result for decoherence , for a system interacting with a nonlinear environment that is initially in a microcanonical ( rather than canonical ) state .",
    "we expect this result to apply when a qubit interacts mainly with a relatively compact , `` mesoscopic '' environment , whose initial spread in energy is smaller that the typical size of @xmath118 relative fluctuations characteristic of a canonical ensemble .",
    "the correction is given by eq .",
    "( [ cmicro ] ) for the general case , and by eq .",
    "( [ cohmic ] ) for an ohmic environment .",
    "we see that the correction is in general of order @xmath21 and so is typically small already for @xmath147 , but it may be enhanced where @xmath23 diverges , i.e. in a proximity of a critical point .",
    "mathematically , the correction to the exponent in ( [ cmicro ] ) , ( [ cohmic ] ) results from the shift in the saddle - point value of @xmath93 . according to ( [ xi_sp ] )",
    ", such a shift can be interpreted as a change in the effective temperature of the environment , due to its interaction with the system . in view of its relation ( [ qr ] ) to the anti - hermitean part of the full green function , the decoherence exponent @xmath148 ( when it is small ) can be interpreted as the probability for the system to emit or absorb an excitation quantum , as a result of the current switching from @xmath39 to @xmath40 . since in a thermal state",
    "the emission is more probable than the absorption , it is easy to imagine that the change in the effective temperature will be positive , leading to an _ increase _ in decoherence .",
    "( the emission probability is proportional to @xmath149 , and the absorption probability to @xmath150 ; combined , the two make the @xmath151 factor in ( [ qr ] ) . ) for example , for ohmic dissipation in the @xmath136 limit , we have = - , which indeed corresponds to an increase in the effective temperature .",
    "we recall , however , that the corresponding increase in decoherence is an @xmath134 effect , subleading in the limit of weak decoherence .",
    "the correction to the preexponent , which is the leading correction in the weak - decoherence limit , represents a different phenomenon , namely , a change in the typical size of fluctuations in the environment as it interacts with the system .",
    "the enhancement of the correction near a critical point reflects the presence of large fluctuations at @xmath152 .",
    "given that , as a condition of thermodynamic stability , @xmath100 , and that it peaks at @xmath153 , we notice that @xmath154 whenever @xmath14 is sufficiently close to @xmath155 from above . from ( [ cmicro ] )",
    ", we see that in this case the term containing @xmath156 is positive , i.e. it tends to suppress decoherence .    for an environment of a finite size , the singularity of @xmath99 at @xmath157 appears through @xmath158 scaling as some positive power of the total volume .",
    "an application of the standard finite - size scaling techniques @xcite , together with hyperscaling , gives @xmath159 and .",
    "the volume , @xmath160 is the number of dimensions , @xmath161 is the specific - heat exponent , and @xmath162 is the correlation - length one .",
    "since @xmath163 , ( [ scaling ] ) shows that the critical singularity of @xmath156 can not completely overcome the macroscopic suppression ( but can reduce it significantly : for comparison , away from the critical point , the left - hand side of ( [ scaling ] ) scales as @xmath164 ) .",
    "however , according to eq .",
    "( [ cmicro ] ) , the part of the correction that is proportional to @xmath156 is also proportional to the relevant dissipative coefficient , such as @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ cohmic ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is a part of the correction containing the derivative of @xmath89 .",
    "thus , it is the scaling of the dissipative coefficient that ultimately determines whether the correction to the thermal result can be large enough to be experimentally observable .",
    "we note that the critical behavior of the dissipative coefficient determines also the leading , thermal part of decoherence near a critical point .",
    "as far as we can tell , however , specific results regarding that behavior are not readily obtainable .",
    "in particular , these dissipative coefficients are distinct from the usual kinetic coefficients introduced in the dynamical theory @xcite , since they involve a summation over the modes of the environment , cf .",
    "( [ spec - dens ] ) .",
    "our results , then , can be taken to underscore the importance of a study of these quantities for different types of interacting environments .",
