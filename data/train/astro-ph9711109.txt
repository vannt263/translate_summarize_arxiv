    "the course of dynamical evolution of pre- and postcollapse globular clusters is determined by many factors such as initial mass function , nature and efficiency of energy generation mechanisms , tidal cut - off , anisotropy of velocity distribution , initial population of binaries , and stellar evolution .",
    "there have been many efforts in developing more and more complex cluster models including such factors , making analysis and interpretation rather difficult . to study the dynamical evolution of globular clusters more realistically , among others ,",
    "chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) included the effects of stellar evolution , lee , falhman , & richer ( 1991 ) used multi - component models , takahashi ( 1995 ) includeded an anisotropic velocity distribution .    however , studying simpler models could be more instructive in identifying important physical processes governing the evolution .",
    "kim , lee , & goodman ( 1997 ; hereafter klg ) studied on the postcollapse evolution of cluster variables and the gravitational oscillation using two - component fokker - planck models . in this paper , as a supplementary study to klg , we present a fitting formula for the corecollapse times of two - component models and compare the results of two- and multi - component models . as in klg , here both tidal - capture binary heating and tree - body binary heating are included , and clusters are assumed to be isotropic and isolated ( no tidal cutoff ) . for the methods that we are using here and the benefits of studying simpler models ( two - component models ) , readers are referred to klg and references therein .",
    "corecollapse times of two - component clusters were presented by inagaki & wiyanto ( 1984 ) , inagaki ( 1985 ) , and lee ( 1995 ) among others .",
    "these papers calculated corecollapse times as a function of @xmath6 , the ratio of total masses of heavy component to light component , and found that the ratio of corecollapse time to initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath7 , has a minimum value at @xmath8 .",
    "however , the paramter @xmath6 may be divided into @xmath9 , the individual mass ratio , and @xmath10 , the number ratio . in the present paper , we calculate the corecollapse times of two - component models as a fuction of more complete two - copmonent cluster parameters , and find a fitting formula between them .",
    "however , the clusters studied here are restricted to those with @xmath11 as in klg .    on the other hand",
    ", it would be helpful in interpreting the results of two - component models if the similarities and discrepancies between the results of two- and multi - component models are well known . in the present paper ,",
    "we also compare two - component models to 11-component models , and thus provide a way to extrapolate to more realistic cluster the results of two - component clusters such as those in klg .",
    "to calculate the corecollapse times of two - component star clusters , we have performed total 11 runs of direct numerical integration of the orbit - averaged fokker - planck equation with a local approximation .",
    "the code used here is descended from cohn ( 1980 ) .",
    "parameters of our two - component runs are shown in table [ table : a ] .",
    "this set of parameters has been chosen such that it provides all possible combinations of parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 , where @xmath12 is the cluster mass and @xmath13 is the total number .",
    "note that in all our runs , the total mass of heavy component , @xmath14 , is negligible compared to the total mass of light component , @xmath15 , and thus @xmath16 . the initial density and velocity profiles are given by plummer models with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the three - dimensional core velocity dispersion , and @xmath20 is the core density .",

    "we empirically found that @xmath29 can be fitted by the following formula : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the initial half - mass radius .",
    "each @xmath29 value is plotted over the righthand side of the above equation in figure [ fig : tcc ] , which shows a good x - y correlation .",
    "equation ( [ tcc ] ) is to be compared with the standard half - mass relaxation time scale , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the root - mean - square three - dimensional velocity of the whole cluster and @xmath36 is the average change of @xmath37 in parallel component to initial @xmath35 per unit time .",
    "isolated single - mass clusters with initial condition of plummer models collapse at 15.4 @xmath5 ( cohn 1980 ) , where @xmath5 is the half - mass relaxation time scale and does not vary much until the corecollapse takes place",
    ". however , the ratios of the time required for corecollapse @xmath29 to @xmath5 and core relaxation time scale @xmath38 strongly depend on the density and velocity profiles . quinlan ( 1996 ) found that for single - mass clusters , @xmath29 varies much less when expressed in units of @xmath38 divided by a dimensionless measure of the temperature gradient in the core .",
    "although in single - mass clusters the velocity profile ( as well as other physical parameters ) evolves by the two - body relaxation , two- or multi - component clusters have another driving force : the equipartition .",
    "both mass segregation and equipartition are envolved in determination of the time to corecollapse , and this complexity makes the theoretical interpretation of the above correlation between @xmath29 and cluster parameters quite difficult .",
    "here we suggest the following analysis as one way to explain this correlation .",
    "the actual duration of corecollapse is very small compared to the time to corecollapse from the begining of cluster s evolution .",
    "instead , clusters spend most of their precollapse phases under mass segregation process and approach to the onset of homologous phase of corecollapse .",
    "if a considerable degree of equipartition is accomplished in the precollapse phase as in all of our two - component models , the time to the onset of corecollapse will be determined by how fast the light component gains the energy from the heavy component via equipartition .",
    "thus one may define the precollapse time scale of two - component clusters @xmath39 as following : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the velocity dispersion change of the light component via interactions with heavy component . using the standard expression for the average velocity dispersion change per unit time , one has @xmath42 where the heavy component mean density @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 and",
    "the coulomb logarithm has been omitted .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath45 .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 , 1987 ) showed that for a two - component cluster of polytropic index @xmath46 between 3 and 5 with @xmath11 and a maxwellian velocity distribution in a parabolic potential well , the minimum degree of the global equipartition is a function of cluster s parameters such that @xmath47    with the minimum value of equation ( [ min_equi ] ) and assumptions that @xmath11 and @xmath48 , equation ( [ tr2 ] ) now becomes @xmath49 the above is in the same form as equation ( [ tcc ] ) with only small discrepancies in the exponents .",
    "although equation ( [ min_equi ] ) has been used for derivation of the above equation , we find that the degrees of equipartition in the precollapse phases of our two - component runs do not directly correlate with the minimum values of equation ( [ min_equi ] ) . in fact ,",
    "exact equipartition is usually not accomplished even when the value of equation ( [ min_equi ] ) is less than unity , because as mass segregation of heavy component progresses , interactions between heavy and light components occur less .",
    "thus equation ( [ min_equi ] ) should be regarded as a degree of tendancy to equipartition and it is this tendancy that @xmath39 requires in its definition .    while quinlan ( 1996 ) introduced a temperature gradient in the core in a derivative form to explain a huge variation in @xmath29 for clusters with different initial profiles , here we introduced both density and velocity gradients of heavy component naturally into the time scale by considering global equipartition .",
    "clusters have continuous mass functions . however , mass functions are usually realized with discrete mass components in numerical calculations .",
    "scientists found that 10 to 20 components are enough to represent continuous mass functions for fokker - planck models , and such numerical representation for a given mass function is quite straightforward for these multi - component clusters : there is only a question of choice of each component s mass bin and a representative value .",
    "however , when the number of components is reduced to 2 for the sake of analytical simplification , such choice is not so simple because dynamically important mass and corresponding number of stars may be different from simple mean mass and total number of a certain mass range . therefore two - component cluster parameters ( such as @xmath9 , @xmath4 , and @xmath13 ) that well represent a continuous mass function should be numerically found through comparisons of the evolution of two- and multi - component clusters .",

    "thus in finding the best matching two - component parameters , it could be more meaningful if @xmath86 is set to @xmath74 . with a restriction of @xmath87 ,",
    "now the number of variables in equation ( [ scale_sim ] ) required for determination of two - component cluster parameters is reduced to two .",

    "note that with these parameters , @xmath93 and this value is about the same with the number of stars in the heaviest four bins ( bins only for degenerate stars ) of model b2 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this may imply that the epoch of corecollapse is mainly determined by the number of stars above the turnoff mass .",
    "this fact also holds for other runs with different @xmath12 and @xmath59 .    for clusters with @xmath95 ( as for our multi - component clusters b1 , b2 , and b3 ) ,",

    "the absolute values of these exponents are little smaller than equation ( [ scale_sim ] ) . however , since the discrepancies are not so significant , we conclude that the evolution aspects of the postcollapse multi - component clusters are still well predictable from the numerical and analytical results of two - component clusters . on the other hand , cluster",
    "variable values at @xmath102 show relatively small x dependence .",
    "the results from method b in table [ table : b3 ] indicate that multi - component clusters may be described by two - component clusters with masses 15 to 20 % less and with @xmath103 near the turnoff mass . of course ,",
    "this @xmath103 is dependent on @xmath59 such that clusters with steeper mass function are matched by two - component clusters with smaller @xmath103 .",
    "however , interestingly , lighter multi - component clusters _ with the same @xmath59 _ also require smaller @xmath103 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath95 holds for runs b1 , b2 , and b3 , while not for their matching two - component clusters by method b ( @xmath104 ) . for method",
    "a , the best matching two - component clusters of runs b1 , b2 , and b3 show @xmath105 , which results in nearly the same @xmath103 .",
    "thus we conclude that the above difference in @xmath103 values by method b for clusters with the same @xmath59 stems from the restriction , @xmath87 .",
    "the evolution of the two - component model with the above parameters is plotted in figure [ fig:2multi ] as well as that of model b2 .",
    "cluster variables @xmath20 , @xmath75 and @xmath33 of two runs well coincide . only the corecollapse times show a small discrepancy .",
    "this is partly because of the dispersion of @xmath29 from the fitting formula , equation ( [ tcc ] ) , and partly because of the small @xmath4 value : equation ( [ tcc ] ) is to be used for clusters with @xmath11 .",
