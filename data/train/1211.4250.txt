    "partitioning a phase space into orbits is a central step in the study of any physical or formal dynamics . immediately after the introduction of graph ( /stabilizer ) states in quantum coding theory @xcite and in the context of measurement - based quantum computation @xcite , it was evident that the related task , when considering the dynamics at the subsystems level , requires approaches of combinatorial flavour . while substantial attention has been given to orbits obtained by the application of local unitaries ( with a clear motivation coming from the classification of multipartite entanglement @xcite ) , the question to decide whether two graph states are equivalent under the action of the local clifford group has been settled , by showing @xcite that the equivalence classes are in one - to - one correspondence with local complementation orbits ( also called _ kotzig orbits _",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the existence of a sequence of local complementations relating the associated graphs guarantees equivalence under local clifford operations and _",
    "viz_.    even though this link does not embrace full local unitary equivalence , having now counterexamples to the lu - lc conjecture ji10 , sarvepalli10 , it unveils a rich interface between the structure of useful multi - qubit systems and a number of mathematical ideas .",
    "indeed , local complementation ( or , equivalently , @xmath2-transformation ) is a fundamental operation for studying circle graphs @xcite .",
    "this notion has been instrumental for unifying certain properties of eulerian tours and matroids via isotropic systems @xcite , constructs associated to vector spaces over @xmath3 ; and it appears in string reconstruction problems ( related to dna sequencing ) and graph polynomials @xcite .    given an equivalence class induced by local complementation , in the present work we shall describe a method for constructing a larger graph associated to the equivalence class .",
    "the method makes use of the stabilizer group of an arbitrary graph state from the class .",
    "each of these graphs is identified with an exclusivity structure and a related _ non - contextuality inequality _ ( for short , nc inequality ) .",
    "such an inequality is an upper bound on the sum of probabilities of a set of events , with some exclusivity constraints ( a technical discussion about events and exclusivity will be given in section [ con ] ) .",
    "nc inequalities are satisfied by any non - contextual hidden variable theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , any physical theory for which the probability of seeing an event is independent of the choice of measurements . quantum mechanics or more general theories can violate such inequalities .",
    "for more details , see @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the graph ( and more generally an hypergraph ) , whose vertices are events , is employed to characterize the correlations for classical and general probabilistic theories satisfying that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events can not be larger than 1 .",
    "the maximum values for the three physical theories : classical , general , and quantum , were computed through the three well - known combinatorial parameters : the independence number , the fractional packing number , and the lovsz number , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "it becomes evident that quantum and general probabilistic correlations satisfying that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events can not be larger than 1 have semidefinite and linear characterizations , respectively .",
    "quantum mechanics is _ sandwiched _ between the other two theories .",
    "the framework introduced in @xcite permits to quantitatively discuss classical , quantum , and more general theories through the analysis of a single mathematical object and to have a general technique to single out quantum correlations with _ ad hoc _ degree of contextuality .",
    "for example , a generic graph with independence number strictly smaller than the lovsz number is associated to a nc inequality violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "if , in addition , the graph has equal lovsz and fractional packing number , then it can be associated to a nc inequality that is maximally violated  by quantum mechanics , meaning that no general probabilistic theory satisfying that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events can not be larger than 1 can achieve a larger value .",
    "( of course , there are graphs for which all theories coincide , as , for example , perfect graphs . )    in the present paper , we propose a construction that translates into the combinatorial language developed in @xcite the connection between every graph state of three or more qubits and a bell inequality maximally violated by quantum mechanics found in @xcite .",
    "namely , we describe a construction that maps any graph on three or more vertices @xmath0 into a larger graph , @xmath1 , such that its independence number is strictly smaller than its lovsz number which is equal to its fractional packing number .",
    "the vertices of @xmath1 represent all possible events consistent with the stabilizer group of the graph state associated to @xmath0 and exclusive events are adjacent .",
    "the construction has also applications in zero - error information theory .",
    "it leads to a straightforward protocol achieving the maximum rate of zero - error entanglement - assisted capacity @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that this quantity for a graph @xmath1 is always strictly larger than its shannon capacity .",
    "a proof of this statement would possibly require a rank bound _ a la haemers_. while it is difficult to compute this bound in general , it may be easier in our case , since @xmath1 has a very particular structure because of the connection with the stabilizer group .",
    "the violation of the bell inequality is here expressed by the one - shot version of this capacity being strictly larger than the independence number .",
    "the correspondence between graphs and exclusivity structures allows us compute the independence number of the graphs @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the complete graph , by taking advantage of well - known techniques used in quantum non - locality .",
    "since two graphs yield the same ( up to isomorphism ) graph in our construction if and only if they are equivalent under local complementation , the construction can be interpreted as a method to represent local complementation orbits .",
    "somehow this is in analogy with the notion of a two - graph , a well - studied mathematical object which represents equivalence classes under the operation of switching ( see ch .",
    "11 of @xcite ) .",
    "our work is innovative with respect to @xcite and @xcite in many ways .",
    "first , we present a characterization of local complementation orbits , a result of pure combinatorial nature .",
    "our representative graphs are obtained via a construction inspired by quantum mechanics .",
    "we find tools to analyze the properties of such graphs in @xcite .",
    "second , by using the results in @xcite , we discover that local complementation orbits are naturally associated to bell inequalities .",
    "we improve the mathematical representation of such bell inequalities by writing down an explicit operational form , namely , a _ pseudo - telepathy game_. the form that we have introduced is often easier to use in both theoretical purposes and the design of laboratory experiments .",
    "third , we introduce a novel connection between the results presented in @xcite and @xcite , and zero - error information theory .",
    "such a connection is also interesting on its own , since it provides a way to construct families of channels with a separation between classical and quantum capacities starting from _ any _ graph .",
    "the remainder of the work is organized as follows .",
    "the next section introduces the required terminology and notions : the language of graph theory , non - locality , and channel capacities .",
    "the construction is described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the relevant graph - theoretic parameters .",
    "section 5 contains examples .",
    "we highlight that physical arguments can be useful to consider difficult tasks such as computing the independence number .",
    "section 6 is devoted to zero - error capacities .",
    "we show that our construction produces infinite families of graphs for which the use of entanglement gives the maximum possible zero - error capacity .",
    "section 7 classifies graphs ( or local complementation orbits ) according to the objects obtained via the construction .",
    "we point out a link with boolean functions and propose a conjecture about connectedness of the graph representatives .",
