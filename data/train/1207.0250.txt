    "recent observations of the apparent magnitude of supernova ia ( snia ) suggest that the universe is in a stage of recent acceleration @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this has now been confirmed by another sets of independent observational data as such the measurements of the galaxy power spectrum and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) detected in the large - scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies in the experiment sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite-@xcite , the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured in the experiment wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most simplest explanation to the recent acceleration is the assumption of the existence of a cosmological constant @xmath1 assumed to stand for the vacuum density energy ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , its inferred value from observations @xmath7 is too tiny when is compared with the theoretical value @xmath8 estimated from the application of the quantum field theory to the planck scale .",
    "this is known as the cosmological constant problem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to this problem , the cosmological constant model has a new one known in the literature as the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite , @xcite-@xcite which can be established as : why are both dark densities ( dark matter and dark energy ) of the same order of magnitude at the present whereas that they were so different in most of the past evolution of the universe ? . in order to avoid the problem of fine tuning of the cosmological constant ,",
    "sometimes it is assumed a null contribution of the vacuum energy density to the cosmological constant which is fixed to zero and therefore it does not contribute to the gravitational sector . in this scenario , we need a different explanation for the present acceleration of the universe . in this direction , it has been proposed a new form of matter - energy named dark energy ( de ) which can be a perfect fluid @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite or a slowly evolving scalar field named quintessence @xcite-@xcite , both with a equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath9 varying with the redshift . in most of the cosmological models considered in the literature , it is generally assumed that dark matter ( dm ) and de interact only gravitationally .",
    "however , it has been argued that , in the absence of an underlying symmetry suppressing a possible coupling between dark matter and dark energy , a phenomenological interaction between them is not only possible but necessary @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to , it has been speculated that an interaction between dark components is able to alleviate or inclusive to solve the problem of the cosmic coincidence @xcite-@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a large body of work dealing with such a possibility has been explored in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the existence or not of some class of interaction between dark components is to be discerned observationally . to this respect",
    ", constraints on the strength of such interaction have been put using different observations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that an interacting term @xmath10 dependent of the redshift crosses the noninteracting line @xmath11 @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this conclusion have been obtained using observational data samples in the range @xmath12 $ ] in order to fit a scenario in which the whole redshift range is divided into a determined numbers of bins and the interaction function is set to be a constant in each bin .",
    "they found an oscillatory behavior of the interaction function @xmath10 changing its sign several times during the evolution of the universe . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "is reported a crossing of the noninteracting line @xmath13 under the assumption that the interacting term @xmath10 is a linearly dependent interacting function of the scale factor with two free parameters to be estimated .",
    "they found a crossing from negative values at the past ( energy transfers from dark matter to dark energy ) to positive values at the present ( energy transfers from dark energy to dark matter ) at @xmath14 .    in order to shed light on the question of",
    "if an interaction term can solved the _ the cosmic coincidence problem _ or if in this scenario such crossing really exists , in a previous article @xcite we propose the reconstruction of a quite general nongravitational interaction @xmath15 between dark components which we introduce phenomenologically in the equations of motion .",
    "this reconstruction of @xmath15 as a function of the redshift was done in terms of an expansion of chebyshev polynomials which constitute a complete orthonormal basis on the finite interval [ -1,1 ] and have the nice property to be the minimax approximating polynomial ( this technique has been applied to the reconstruction of the de potential in @xcite-@xcite ) . to this respect , we did the reconstruction of the interaction function using the data from the union2 ia supernova ( snia ) data test ( 557 data ) @xcite . in this article",
    ", we use a set of data samples covering the wide range of redshift @xmath16 $ ] in order to reconstruct the interaction function @xmath15 from late to early times .",
    "a summary of the paper is as follows . in the second section",
    ", we introduce the general formalism and the equations of motion representing a de fluid interacting with a dm fluid in einstein gravity . in the third section ,",
    "we write the cosmological equations of motion for the interacting dark fluids in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime .",
    "we continue in the section fourth with the introduction and development of the method for reconstructing the interaction function in terms of an expansion in the base of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the fifth section is dedicated to describe the parametric bayesian statistical method used in the reconstruction of the interaction function together with the chi - square test and the priors used on the free parameters of each model . additionally , we present the observations used in this article in order to fit the free parameters of the models considered .",
    "these observations consist in the data from the union2 ia supernova ( snia ) data test ( 557 data ) @xcite , the bao from sdss dr7 @xcite , the cmb from 7-year wmap experiment @xcite , the hubble expansion rate ( 15 data ) @xcite-@xcite , @xcite and the x - ray gas mass fraction ( 42 data ) @xcite .",
    "then , the sixth section is dedicated to the reconstruction of the interaction function and , to put constraints on the parameters of each model and on the coefficients of the chebyshev expansion then we give a discussion of the results of the reconstruction and the best estimated values of the parameters of every model fitting the observations . finally , in the last section we present a brief resume of our principal results and our conclusions .",
    "we assume an universe formed by four components : the baryonic matter fluid @xmath17 , the radiation fluid @xmath18 , the dark matter fluid @xmath19 and the dark energy fluid @xmath20 .",

    "however , taking in account the errors corresponding to the fit using three parameters ( @xmath249 ) , we see that within the @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors , it exists the possibility of crossing of the noninteracting line in the recent past at around the range @xmath378 .",
    "crossings of the noninteracting line @xmath13 have been recently reported at the references @xcite ( with an interacting term @xmath10 proportional to the hubble parameter ) and @xcite .",
    "the direction of the change found in our work is in the same direction to the results published by these references where a crossing ( from positive values at the past to negative values at the present was found at @xmath379 . on the other hand , we did not find the oscillatory behavior of the interaction function found by cai and su @xcite who , using observational data samples in the range @xmath380 $ ] , fitted a scheme in which the whole redshift range is divided into a determined numbers of bins and the interaction function set to be a constant in each bin .    from figures [ totalcoincidencemodels ] to figures [ errorstotalcoincidencemodels ] show that , for all the interacting models studied in this work , the best estimates for the dark energy density parameter @xmath362 become to be definite positive at all the range of redshifts considered in the data samples .",
    "however , this statement is conclusive because within the @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors for the fit with three parameters ( @xmath249 ) , the @xmath362 becomes to be positive in all the range of redshifts considered ( remember that we are using five data sets and then the space parameters permitted is remarkably reduced ) .",
    "according to the model 4 , note also that the behavior of dark matter @xmath361 density parameter , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors exist the possibility of being smaller compared to the noninteracting model ( lcdm model ) .    from figures [ totaldeceleratemodels ] to figure [ errorstotaldeceleratemodels ] , show that , for all models , a transition from a deceleration era at early times dominated by the dark and baryonic matter density to an acceleration era at late times corresponding to the present domain of the dark energy density .",
    "this transition deceleration - acceleration to take place at redshift at around @xmath381 ( it was also obtained by @xcite ) , while that the rhythm of current universe at around @xmath382 . it is clear for our constraint , that the universe tends to an early time to accelerate and a milder expansion rhythm at present .",
    "we can see from the figure [ totalcoincidencemodels ] to [ errorstotalcoincidencemodels ] that , at the present , the dark energy density parameter becomes @xmath383 , which is sufficiently large to generate a non negligible dimensionless interacting term of the order of @xmath384 , as is shown in the figures [ totalexchangemodels ] and [ errorstotalexchangemodels ] .",
    "in fact , in these same figures we can appreciate that in the interval of redshifts @xmath385 $ ] , the dimensionless interaction is in the range @xmath386 $ ] for the model ii , @xmath387 $ ] for the model iii and @xmath388 $ ] for the model iv respectively , corresponding at @xmath5 error .",
    "the order of magnitude of this interaction is in agreement with the local constraints put on the strength of a constant dimensionless interaction derived from the fit to a data sample of virial masses of relaxed galaxies clusters obtained using weak lensing , x - ray and optical data @xcite .    on the contrary , a recent study fitting cmb anisotropy data from the seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , the bao distance measurements @xcite , the constitution sample of snia @xcite and constraints on the present - day hubble constant , put stronger constraints on the magnitude of such dimensionless strength of the order of @xmath389 @xcite .",
    "another important aspect concerns to study the coincidence problem , then from the figures [ totalcoincidencemodels ] and [ errorstotalcoincidencemodels ] , we note that the models ii and iii , do not have the possibility of alleviating this problem .",
    "their behaviors are in a degree similar to the lcdm model . on the contrary , our model iv ,",
    "has the possibility of alleviating it at @xmath5 error . in the behavior of dark matter",
    "@xmath361 density parameter , within @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors , exist the possibility of being smaller compared to the corresponding noninteracting model ( lcdm model ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that from the figure [ totalagemodels ] to figure [ errorstotalagemodels ] and according to the results of the tables [ ageuniverse2 ] , [ ageuniverse3 ] and [ ageuniverse4 ] , the best fitted values predicted for our models are consistent with the requirement that the universe be older that any of its constituents at a given redshift @xcite , @xcite .    from all our analysis , and from the figure",
    "[ totalmodel3 ] and [ totalmodel4 ] , [ totalcoincidencemodels ] and [ errorstotalcoincidencemodels ] , show that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 constraints on the eos parameter @xmath52 contain high probability of being in the phantom region , but our results are even consistent and compatible with the lcdm model at @xmath4 error .    in general when",
    "more cosmic observational data sets are added to constrain our model parameters space , the degeneracies between model parameters will be broken .",
    "the reason comes from the fact that the constraints on our models are more stringent that the results obtained in reference @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we developed theoretically a novel method for the reconstruction of the interaction function between dark matter and dark energy assuming an expansion of the general interaction term proportional to the hubble parameter in terms of chebyshev polynomials which form a complete set of orthonormal functions . to show how the method works ,",
    "we applied it to the reconstruction of the interaction function expanding it in terms of only the first @xmath90 chebyshev polynomials ( with @xmath111 ) and fitted for the coefficients of the expansion assuming three models : ( a ) a de equation of the state parameter @xmath390 ( an interacting cosmological @xmath1 ) , ( b ) a de equation of the state parameter @xmath391 constant and ( c ) a de equation of the state parameter @xmath391 constant and @xmath392 constant , respectively .",
    "the fit of the free parameters of every model is done using the union2 sne ia data set from `` the supernova cosmology project '' ( scp ) composed by 557 type ia supernovae @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from 7-year wmap , the observational hubble data and the cluster x - ray gas mass fraction .",
    "our principal results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "compared with the results of reference @xcite , our fitting results show a faster convergence of the best fitted values for the several cosmological variables considered in this paper when the numbers of parameters @xmath90 is increased in the expansion ( [ eq : coupling ] ) .",
    "2 .   the best estimates for the interaction function @xmath82 prefer to cross the noninteracting line @xmath370 during the present cosmological evolution .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the numbers of coefficients ( up to @xmath112 in this work ) used in the expansion of @xmath82 .",
    "the crossing implies a change of sign of @xmath82 from positive values at the past ( energy transfers from dark energy to dark matter ) to negative values at the present ( energy transfers from dark matter to dark energy ) .",
    "this direction of decay is similar to the results found in the recent literature @xcite and is in disagreement with the oscillatory behavior reported in @xcite .",
    "the statement above is conclusive because the existence of crossing of the noninteracting line @xmath393 in some moment of the recent past is totally contained inside the @xmath4 and @xmath5 constraints given by current observations .",
    "we can state that is reasonable to expect that de and dm interact via a small but calculable coupling and to be consistent with the observations at @xmath5 error . in this aspect , the the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "data provides a stringent constraints on the coupling .",
    "we confirm that adding the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the observational hubble ( h ) and the cluster x - ray gas mass fraction ( x - ray ) data sets , generally reduces the allowed range of the model parameters .",
    "it is to say are strongly reduced compared with the results of the ref @xcite , which were obtained using only union2 sne ia data .",
    "for all the interacting models studied in this work , the best estimates for the dark energy density parameter @xmath362 becomes positive definite in the range of redshifts considered in this work .",
    "this statement is conclusive because , within the @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors for the fit with three parameters ( @xmath249 ) , @xmath362 becomes positive in all the range of redshifts considered in the observational data sets .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 confidence intervals , for the eos parameter @xmath241 considered in the marginalized models iii and iv , preferred to be in the phantom region ( @xmath394 ) . but exists a small probability for the eos parameter @xmath241 of being in the quintessence region .",
    "this conclusion is consistent and is within of lcdm model .",
    "according to the figures [ totaldeceleratemodels ] and [ errorstotaldeceleratemodels ] and to our results , we confirm that there is strong evidence that the universe is accelerated in the recent past , which is consistent with studies in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that our models are consistent with the properties of the cosmological variables and its results are also consistent with the lcdm model at @xmath5 error .",
    "finally , we emphasize the importance of more accurate and extensive measurements .",
    "these observations will certainly provide a complementary tool to test the reality of the current cosmological parameters , of the term of interaction between dark sectors and the existence of the crossing of the noninteracting @xmath370 line and place stringent constraints on them , and as a consequence , to distinguish among the many alternatives models .",
    "we believe that the analysis , combined with the results give us the possibility of understanding all that . with the successful experience achieved to reconstruct the general interaction term between dark matter and dark energy ,",
    "our next step is to extend our study to do a double reconstruction as much the interaction term @xmath82 as dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath241 simultaneously , within the dark sectors .",

    "<S> recently , in @xcite we developed a parametric reconstruction method to a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model filled of a fluid of dark energy ( de ) with constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter interacting with dark matter ( dm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction method is based on expansions of the general interaction term and the relevant cosmological variables in terms of chebyshev polynomials which form a complete set orthonormal functions . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction term describes an exchange of energy flow between the de and dm within dark sector . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we reconstruct the interaction function expanding it in terms of only the first four chebyshev polynomials and obtain the best estimation for the coefficients of the expansion assuming three models : ( a ) a de equation of the state parameter @xmath0 ( an interacting cosmological @xmath1 ) , ( b ) a de equation of the state parameter @xmath2 constant with a dark matter density parameter fixed , ( c ) a de equation of the state parameter @xmath2 constant with a free constant dark matter density parameter to be estimated , and using the recent five test data : union2 sne ia data set from `` the supernova cosmology project '' ( scp ) composed by 557 type ia supernovae , the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , the cmb anisotropies from 7-year wmap experiment , the hubble expansion rate data and the x - ray gas mass fraction . in all the cases , the preliminary reconstruction shows that in the best scenario there exist the possibility of a crossing of the noninteracting line @xmath3 in the recent past within the @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors from positive values at early times to negative values at late times . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , in this reconstruction , there is an energy transfer from de to dm at early times and an energy transfer from dm to de at late times . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that this fact is an indication of the possible existence of a crossing behavior in a general interaction coupling between dark components . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conclude that in this scenario , the observations put strong constraints on the strength of the interaction so that its magnitude can not solve the coincidence problem or at least alleviate significantly . </S>"
