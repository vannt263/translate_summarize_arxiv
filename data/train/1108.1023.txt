    "the spectrum of cosmic rays ( crs ) has offered few clues to its origin so far .",
    "the only features observed are at very high and ultrahigh energies ( see , e.g. , figure  1 in * ? ? ? * ) : the so - called knee at a few times @xmath1 ev @xcite , the second `` knee '' at @xmath2@xmath3 ev , the `` ankle '' at higher energies @xcite , and a spectral steepening above @xmath4 ev @xcite .",
    "because of the limited size of galactic accelerators and strength of magnetic fields in the acceleration region ( e.g. , in supernova remnants [ snrs ] ) , it is believed that the crs below the knee are galactic , while above the knee they have an extragalactic origin , with the knee itself being due to propagation effects and a transition between the two populations of crs @xcite .",
    "the power - law spectrum below the knee is thought to be the result of cr acceleration in snr shocks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is steepened to the observed index @xmath5 by propagation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and eventual leakage from the galaxy .",
    "the interstellar diffusion coefficient is typically assumed to be a power law in particle rigidity , based on numerous studies of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the turbulent cascade often leads to a distribution of magnetic energy that is well described by a power law . for energies below @xmath6  gev  nucleon@xmath7",
    ", the cr spectrum flattens due to the modulation in the heliosphere  a combined effect of the solar wind and heliospheric magnetic field .",
    "measurements of cr composition below a few gev  nucleon@xmath7 offer detailed information on elemental and isotopic abundances @xcite , including the peaked shape of the secondary - to - primary nuclei ratio ( e.g. , b / c , sub - fe / fe ) and abundances of long - lived radionuclides ( such as @xmath8be , @xmath9al , @xmath10cl , and @xmath11mn ) .",
    "these measurements are used to derive the ( model - dependent ) diffusion coefficient and the size of the galactic volume filled with crs @xcite , the so - called halo .",
    "models of cr propagation are in reasonable agreement with available data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a few exceptions , including the unexpected rise in the positron fraction observed by pamela @xcite .",
    "the data recently collected by three experiments , atic-2 @xcite , cream @xcite , and pamela @xcite , indicate a break ( hardening ) of the spectra of the most abundant cr species above a rigidity of a few hundred gv .",
    "the break rigidity , @xmath12 , is best measured by pamela and occurs at approximately the same rigidity for @xmath13 and he , @xmath14  gv . the pamela data for @xmath15 gv @xmath16 agree very well with the earlier data from ams and bess ( see @xcite and figure  1 of @xcite ) , while atic-2 data points for @xmath17 are somewhat lower .",
    "we take the pamela data as the most accurate for @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "atic-2 results agree well with those of cream .",
    "the change in the spectral index ( below / above the break ) is estimated as @xmath19 , and is the same for protons and he .",
    "another important feature of the cr spectra discovered by these experiments is the difference between the spectral indices of cr protons and he .",
    "this has been speculated for a long time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but the experimental uncertainties were too large to be conclusive ( see the collection of cr proton and he measurements in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the new measurements by the atic-2 , cream , and pamela experiments confirm this with high significance .",
    "the spectrum of he is found to be harder than the spectrum of protons for energies up to , at least , 10@xmath20  gev  nucleon@xmath7 .",
    "the difference between the proton and he spectral indices calculated by @xcite using the pamela data is @xmath21 , and it is approximately the same above and below @xmath12 . within the statistical and systematic uncertainty",
    ", the measured @xmath13/he flux ratio appears to be a smooth function of rigidity , continuous at @xmath12 .",
    "this shows that the difference in the spectral slope of protons and he nuclei persists into the ultra - relativistic regime .    there is also fine structure in the spectra that may provide some clues to the nature of the observed features :",
    "pamela data clearly show a spectral softening at the break rigidity ( which we refer to as the `` dip '' , below ) . @xcite",
    "have shown the softening to be statistically significant at the 95% confidence level for the spectra as functions of particle rigidity , and at the 99.7% level for the same data in terms of kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "the softening is more pronounced in the he spectrum .    rather than proposing a detailed interpretation of the observed features , in this paper we discuss broad categories of models , hereafter called _ scenarios _ , and propose their observational tests . a particular realization of each scenario",
    "is called _",
    "calculation_. the quantitative analysis is done using the galprop code @xcite .",
    "we study the interpretations of the @xmath13/he ratio variation separately from the interpretations of the spectral break at @xmath12 . in section  [ refcase ]",
    ", we introduce the reference scenario based on the pre - pamela data . in section  [ subsectionphe ]",
    ", we discuss possible explanations of the @xmath13/he ratio decline with energy : inherent nature of cr sources and spallation effects .",
    "section  [ breakdip ] presents four physical scenarios that could lead to the observed spectral break at @xmath12 : injection effects , propagation effects , and local low- or high - energy cr source .",
    "the framework of our cr propagation calculations is described in sections  [ galprop ] and [ dr_and_pd ] , and specific calculation setups in section  [ models ] .",
    "the sections following that discuss our results and their implications to cr observations and cr propagation modeling .",
    "_ _ scenario  r _ : reference scenario_. first , we introduce a reference case based on the pre - pamela data . in this scenario ,",
    "the cr injection spectrum above 10  gv is a single power law up to the `` knee '' in the cr spectrum , with the same spectral index for all cr species .",
    "the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient at high energies is also taken as a single power law for all energies .",
    "the cr source distribution is described in section  [ calculations ] .    _",
    "scenario  r _  provides reasonable agreement with the pre - pamela data , but it can not reproduce the spectral features evident in the new data discussed in this paper : the difference between proton and he spectra , the spectral break , or the dip .",
    "below , we describe several broad categories of models that encompass viable explanations for these new features .",
    "the comparison of predictions for these other models for quantities other than cr proton , he , and electron spectra with predictions of _ calculation  r _  qualitatively illustrates the significance of the difference between different scenarios .      the confirmation of a significant difference between proton and he spectral indices poses a challenge for theories of cr acceleration and propagation .",
    "whatever the physical cause of this difference in spectra may be , it seems to affect heavier nuclei in the same way as it does he ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for spectra of nuclei ) , giving them a harder spectrum than that of protons .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) predicts the spectrum of he _ trapped _ in a shock to be harder than that of protons due to its lower @xmath22 ratio , but only for non - relativistic energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in particles _ escaping _ from a shock , @xmath13/he ratio may decline with energy , if dsa is rapid , and the injection of he into the acceleration process varies in a way that enhances he acceleration in young shocks .",
    "this could happen due to the inherent property of particle injection in shocks @xcite , or if the abundance of he @xcite or magnetic field orientation @xcite is inhomogeneous in the snr environment .",
    "we encompass these mechanisms into the acceleration hypothesis ( _ hypothesis  a _ ) , which is discussed below .",
    "note that propagation effects may contribute to the @xmath13/he spectral difference because the second - order fermi process ( reacceleration ) in the interstellar medium makes the he spectrum harder due to its lower @xmath22 ratio .",
    "this effect , however , does not extend to the ultra - relativistic regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an alternative idea , suggested by @xcite , is that that spallation of cr nuclei ( @xmath23 ) may lead to hardening of their spectra .",
    "this is because the lower energy crs have longer confinement times in the galaxy , and their flux is depleted by spallation more than the flux of higher energy nuclei .",
    "hardening occurs only if the spallation timescale is short compared to the confinement timescale of the nuclei .",
    "note that @xcite consider crs at energies above 1  tev and do not attempt to make their model consistent with the cr data at low energies , where various effects , such as stochastic reacceleration and significant production of secondaries , come into play .",
    "we investigate this idea , extending it to lower energies , and hereafter refer to it as _ hypothesis  s_. our calculations include spallation of all nuclei species at all energies , the default with galprop .",
    "however , as our results for _ calculation  r _  show ( see section  [ results ] ) , the effect of spallation on the he spectrum is insignificant , and the @xmath13/he ratio above 10  gv is flat .",
    "below , we demonstrate that , with some model tuning ( i.e. , _ calculation  s_@xmath24 ) , fragmentation may indeed lead to hardening of the he spectrum .",
    "we also assess the consequences of the required model modifications .",
    "note that in this section we refer to the results of our calculations for _ hypothesis  s_. the framework and details of these calculations are formally introduced later in the text in section  [ calculations ] .",
    "however , we would like to briefly discuss _ hypothesis  s _  here , because in the rest of the paper we discard _",
    "hypothesis  s _  and adopt the assumption that the @xmath13/he decline is caused by the nature of cr accelerators ( _ hypothesis  a _ ) .",
    "the reader interested in our reasoning for discarding the spallation effects hypothesis may find the explanation in this section . and",
    "a detailed description of our physical model , computational method and data sources can be found in sections  [ calculations ] and [ results ] , where we discuss the spectral break at @xmath12 .    _ _ hypothesis  s _ : spallation effects_. the fraction of fragmented cr nuclear species depends on their total inelastic cross section and the effective grammage encountered by the cr species in the galaxy .",
    "inelastic cross section fits used in @xcite , taken from @xcite , are somewhat larger than those used in our calculations @xcite . besides that , the gas number density used in calculations by @xcite yields a significantly larger grammage than in our standard models . to segregate these effects , we construct two calculation setups for _ hypothesis  s _ : _ calculation  s_@xmath25 and _ calculation  s_@xmath26 .",
    "both calculations adopt the cross section fits from @xcite .",
    "_ calculation  s",
    "_  uses parameters similar to that of the reference _",
    "calculation  r _ , but a slightly smaller diffusion coefficient to match the value used by @xcite . in _",
    "calculation  s_@xmath27 , we additionally increase the gas number density relative to _",
    "calculation  r _  by a factor of two .",
    "note that these calculations use the galprop code , which was adapted to incorporate the above - mentioned inelastic cross sections , whereas the production of fragments ( daughter isotopes ) is calculated using a standard set of cross sections and remains unchanged .",
    "our calculations show that with our standard gas distribution based on astronomical data @xcite , _ calculation  s_@xmath28 , the amount of hardening is insufficient to provide agreement with the pamela @xmath13/he ratio . the required hardening of the he ( @xmath29 ) spectrum can be achieved",
    "only if we assume a considerable increase in grammage and simultaneously adopt a set of total inelastic cross sections from @xcite , _ calculation  s_@xmath27",
    ". however , this leads to an overproduction of secondary species in crs , such as antiprotons and boron , so that the calculated b / c ratio does not agree with the data .",
    "the @xmath13/he ratio obtained in _",
    "calculation  s_@xmath28 and _ calculation  s_@xmath27 is shown in the top panels of figure  [ fig_spallation ] ( see section  [ dr_and_pd ] for an overview of the plain diffusion and diffusive - reacceleration models ) .",
    "the calculated b / c ratio and @xmath30  flux are shown in the middle and bottom panels , respectively .",
    "read on and see figures  [ fig_injection][fig_diffusion ] for details on the parameters of the calculations shown in figure  [ fig_spallation ] .    another important point to consider here",
    "is that the measurements of pamela , atic-2 , and cream are not sensitive to the isotopic composition of cr fluxes .",
    "the he fluxes reported by these experiments and used throughout this paper are , in fact , the sum of @xmath31he and @xmath20he species .",
    "the dominant channel of @xmath20he spallation is the reaction    @xmath32    this reaction leads to a hardening of the interstellar @xmath20he spectrum because lower energy nuclei experience more spallation events .",
    "however , due to production of @xmath31he in the same reaction , the _ total _ he spectrum does not harden as much as @xmath20he alone .",
    "further spallation of secondary @xmath31he , as well as fragmentation of @xmath20he into products other than @xmath31he , eventually leads to the total he spectrum hardening .",
    "still , the effect of spallation on the total he spectrum is not as strong as on @xmath20he alone .",
    "equation  ( 2.1 ) in @xcite indicates that @xmath31he was not included in their calculations .",
    "therefore , their results would be relevant only for the @xmath13/@xmath20he ratio .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig_spallation ] , where we also plot the ratio of @xmath13/@xmath20he in _",
    "calculation  s_@xmath27 for reference .",
    "it can be seen that the overall shape of the @xmath13/@xmath20he ratio matches the measured @xmath13/he ratio well ; however , a significant fraction of secondary @xmath31he changes the shape so that the calculated @xmath13/he ratio can not be adjusted to match the data simultaneously at all rigidities ( 1 gv  10 tv ) .",
    "_ _ hypothesis  a _ : acceleration effects_. we have concluded that the adjustments of propagation model required to reproduce the observed @xmath13/he ratio in _ hypothesis  s_@xmath27 conflict with the measurements of secondary cr species .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this work we adopt an alternative to _",
    "hypothesis  s _ , which we call the `` acceleration hypotheses '' .",
    "_ hypothesis  a_represents the idea that the nature of cr accelerators is responsible for a harder spectrum of he than @xmath13 ( see references at the beginning of this section ) . to incorporate _",
    "hypothesis  a _  into our calculations ,",
    "we use an ad hoc modification for the cr injection spectra .",
    "that is , our calculations assume that nuclei heavier than h are injected into the ism with a harder spectrum than protons .",
    "the difference between the spectral indices of protons and heavier nuclei is the same for all rigidities and is @xmath33 .",
    "we do not present a separate calculation for the _ hypothesis  a _  in this paper .",
    "instead , we incorporate _ hypothesis  a _  into calculations that study scenarios _ p , i , l _ and _ h _ for the break in the @xmath13 and he spectra ( those scenarios are introduced in section  [ breakdip ] ) . figure  [ fig_p_he_ratio ] shows the @xmath13/he ratio resulting from this modification ( see below for parameters of other calculations shown in this figure ) .",
    "the figure illustrate that the data reported by pamela , atic-2 , and cream can be reproduced by including @xmath33 .",
    "we consider the following scenariosfor an explanation of the break at @xmath12 and the dip just below @xmath12 : ( 1 ) interstellar propagation effects , ( 2 ) modification of cr injection spectrum at the sources , ( 3 ) composite galactic cr spectrum , ( 4 ) effects of local sources at low energies ( @xmath34 ) , and ( 5 ) effects of local sources at high energies ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "particular realizations of these scenarios  ( calculations ) are discussed in detail in section  [ models ] ; their parameters are summarized in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table1pd ] .",
    "_ _ scenario  p _ : interstellar propagation effects_. transport of crs in the ism is subject to considerable uncertainties , because the properties of interstellar magnetic turbulence are not very well known @xcite .",
    "this makes cr observations a valuable indirect probe of quantitative features of particle transport ( e.g. , the diffusion coefficient , @xmath36 ) in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , in this scenario , the break in the observed proton and he spectra is attributed to a change in cr transport properties at rigidity @xmath12 .",
    "this scenario is represented by _",
    "calculation  p _ , which has a break in the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient at @xmath37 . for @xmath17",

    "_ _ scenario  i  @xmath39 _ : cr injection effects , source with a spectral break interpretation_. existing models of cr production by snr shocks ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) predict a smooth spectrum of cr particles injected by an snr into the galaxy .",
    "such models usually consider a shock in a semi - infinite medium or assume spherical symmetry .",
    "the spectrum predicted by these models may gradually harden with energy between 10  gev and 100  tev , but not as rapidly as in the pamela data .",
    "note that particle transport , magnetic turbulence generation , and nonlinear feedback of particles and magnetic fields on shock structure are not strictly constrained in these models .",
    "the spectrum of particles leaking from an snr shock has never been observed directly .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that with some parameter tuning , present models of particle acceleration may predict a more pronounced hardening in the spectrum of particles injected into the ism , consistent with the new data .",
    "alternatively , particle acceleration models that take into account the asymmetry of snrs may predict a break in the particle spectrum produced by a single snr .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite , the break , or upturn , occurs due to the contribution of the snr s polar cap .",
    "this case , hereafter referred to as _",
    "scenario  i  @xmath39 _ , is represented by _",
    "calculation  i _ , which features a galaxy - wide source spectrum with a hardening at @xmath12 .",

    "_ scenario  i  @xmath40 _ : cr injection effects , composite source interpretation_. while snrs ( isolated or in superbubble regions ) are believed to be the primary sources of galactic crs , different classes of supernovae and their environments , as well as other cr sources , can combine to produce the observed cr spectrum .",
    "generally speaking , different types of cr sources could have different spatial distributions throughout the galaxy . in this work",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption ( 1 ) that there are only two types of cr sources , and ( 2 ) the spatial distributions are the same for both types of cr sources .",
    "if one source dominates the low energy part of the cr spectrum , and the other the high energy part , then _ calculation  i _ , with a hardening of the galactic cr source at @xmath12 , adequately encompasses this composite source scenario as well .",
    "this scenario may be generalized to a distribution of cr sources with different parameters . @xcite",
    "have shown that in general , dispersion in the cr source spectral indices results in the concavity of the observed cr spectrum .",
    "we use the same computational setup to calculate the observed quantities for _ scenario  i  @xmath39 _  and _ scenario  i  @xmath40 _ , and we call it just _ calculation  i_. a subtle advantage of the composite source interpretation of _ calculation  i _  ( i.e. , in",

    "one possible explanation for the dip may be provided in the framework of _ scenario  l _  and _ scenario  i  @xmath40_. it can naturally appear if the spectrum of the low - energy cr sources ( local , as in _ scenario  l _ , or galactic , as in _",

    "in _ calculation  p _ , despite a break in the diffusion coefficient , the electron spectrum at earth does not fit the high - energy data and is not convex ( figure  [ fig_electrons ] ) .",
    "this is because synchrotron energy losses above 100  gev oppose the effect of the diffusion coefficient break , and cause the spectral softening .    in the injection effects scenario , represented by _",
    "calculation  i _ , it is possible to modify the source spectrum of electrons in order to fit the data .",
    "indeed , since the nucleon injection spectrum has a break at @xmath12 , it is natural to assume that the electron injection spectrum may have a similar feature .",
    "this argument holds both in the source with a spectral break interpretation ( _ scenario  i  @xmath39 _ ) and the composite spectrum interpretation ( _ scenario  i  @xmath40 _ ) of _ calculation  i_. moreover , the energy and magnitude of the break do not have to be the same for electrons and protons because the electron to proton ratio may vary with energy and with source type . as figure  [ fig_electrons ] shows , one can achieve agreement with the data by assuming that the electron source spectrum has a break ( hardening ) at @xmath142  gv ( 61  gv in the pd model ) , with the index changing from @xmath143 to @xmath144 ( or @xmath145 to @xmath146 for pd ) .",

    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig_anisotropy ] , along with data .",
    "references to individual experiments may be found in @xcite ; see also @xcite for a color version of the plot .",
    "the anisotropy , dominated by the radial component , is highly sensitive to the choice of the diffusion coefficient and the spatial distribution of cr sources .",
    "our calculation ignores the effect of nearby cr sources , which may be significant @xcite , but is not very well defined and depends on the assumed distances to the sources and their ages .",
    "however , if the diffusive component of the anisotropy dominates in a certain energy range , two conclusions may be drawn from this plot .",
    "the first one is that _",

    "the second point illustrated by our calculation is that the diffusion regime of _ calculation  p _  with @xmath148 and",
    "@xmath124 agrees with the available data better than @xmath149 .",
    "the pd model , due to a harder dependence of the diffusion coefficient on rigidity , predicts a higher degree of anisotropy , which disagrees with the data more than the other calculations .    in the case of _ calculation  h _ , the plotted lines correspond to only the galactic source , while the direction and magnitude of the local source flux anisotropy above @xmath12 are unknown .",
    "depending on the location and proximity of the local source , the direction of the overall cr drift can be changed substantially , because the local source flux above @xmath150  gv is comparable to the galactic flux ( see the bottom plots in figure  [ fig_cr_spectra ] ) .",
