    "it is well known that the average magnitude of radial flow at the freeze - out surface can be extracted from the transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) spectra of the hadrons .",

    "therefore , estimating radial flow from the em probes will shed light on the time evolution of the collectivity in the system .",
    "the generation of collectivity in the system depends on eos - hence this can be used to differentiate partonic and hadronic phases as the eos for these two phases are different . in case of em",
    "probes- dilepton has the advantage over the real photons . because the low @xmath2 photons from the hadronic phase receive large transverse kick due to radial flow and consequently appear in the high @xmath2 domain to mingle with those from the qgp phase , making the detection of photons from qgp difficult .",
    "however , for dileptons there are two kinematic variables available - the @xmath2 and the invariant mass ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "while the @xmath2 spectra of dilepton is affected by the flow , the @xmath2 integrated @xmath0 spectra remains unaltered .",
    "this suggests that a careful selection of @xmath2 and @xmath0 windows will be very useful to characterize the qgp and hadronic phases . in the present work",
    "we will demonstrate how the development of radial flow can be estimated through the hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) interferometry with virtual photons ( lepton pairs ) for different @xmath0 windows .",

    "in contrast , the lepton pairs with @xmath33 are emitted from the late hadronic phase where the collective flow or @xmath34 is large , which is reflected as a dip in @xmath23 for @xmath35 .",
