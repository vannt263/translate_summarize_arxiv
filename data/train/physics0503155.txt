    "there is a well known similarity between the two - dimensional models of the planetary atmosphere and the magnetized plasma . in the absence of dissipation",
    "the models can be reduced to differential equations having the same structure : the charney equation for the nonlinear rossby waves , in the physics of the atmosphere @xcite ; and the hasegawa - mima equation for drift wave turbulence , in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "they are similar with the navier - stokes equation because they have two conserved quantities , the energy and the enstrophy .",
    "this in principle allows states of negative temperatures , or , equivalently , these models support a trend to organised vortical flow .",
    "it results the possibility to have as solutions coherent structures ( vortices ) besides the turbulent states characterised by spectral cascade .",
    "these analytical models have led to a serious advancement of our knowledge in both fields .",
    "however the stationary states appear to be described within these models by a reduced equation having a too wide generality , representing actually something as a constraint with weak ability to identify unequivocally the real solutions : it simply states that at stationarity the advection of the vorticity by the velocity vector field vanishes . in reality ,",
    "numerical simulations show that the stationary states reached in relaxation are very regular and persist for a long time period and that this set of asymptotic states is not the huge space of functions able to fulfill the constrained mentioned above .",
    "the fluid evolves at relaxation toward a reduced subset of functions , characterized by regular shape of the streamfunction @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and references therein ) . at the oposite",
    "limit the turbulent regime can be treated with renormalization group methods @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the same phenomenon exists in the case of the ideal fluid described by the euler equation . by experiments and numerical simulation",
    "it has been shown that the ideal fluid evolves at relaxation toward a very ordered flow pattern , consisting of two ( positive and negative ) vortices and that this state persists for very long times , being limitted by only the effect of some residual dissipation . from numerical simulations",
    "it has also been inferred the form of the flow function .",
    "it has been found that the streamfunction obeys , in these states , the _ sinh_-poisson equation .",
    "montgomery and his collaborators have developed a theoretical statistical model which explains the appearence of this equation in this context @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "later , the equation has also been derived by formulating the continuum version of point - like vortices as a field theoretical model of interacting gauge and matter fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the essential point of the latter derivation was the self - duality of the relaxation states of the fluid .",
    "no equation ( similar to the _ sinh_-poisson equation in the euler fluid case ) has been found for the charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm ) equation , despite a considerable effort @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned before , there are convincing experimental and numerical indications that the fluids ( atmosphere and plasma ) evolve to a reduced subset of states .",
    "we have developed a field theoretical model for the point - like vortices with short range interaction , based on chern - simons action for the gauge field in interaction with the nonlinear matter field , again in @xmath1 algebra .",
    "it is then possible to derive the energy as a functional that becomes extremum on a subset of stationary states and presents particular properties .",
    "the general characterization of this family of states is their _ self - duality _ , which here means that the energy functional becomes minimum because the square terms are all vanishing , leaving as lower bound a quantity with topological meaning .",
    "a very detailed account of the derivation is in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the result is a set of equations parametrized by the solutions of the laplacean equation in two - dimensions .",
    "the simplest of these equations is @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is a positive constant ) .",
    "there are already some confirmations that this is the equation governing the asymptotic stationary states of the chm fluids : the scatterplots of @xmath4 = ( streamfunction , vorticity ) obtained in experiments @xcite and the scatterplots obtained in numerical simulations @xcite are very similar to the nonlinear term of eq.([eq ] ) .",
    "the objective of this work is to provide the first elements resulting from a numerical investigation of this equation .",
    "the results are summarised here .",
    "this differential equation is able to reproduce the main two - dimensional features of the typhoon vortical flow . in the physics of the atmosphere",
    ", it seems that other examples , like the tropical cyclones , can be reproduced by solutions of this equation .",
    "the following are the features we consider as very particular to the typhoon morphology ( in @xmath5 )  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite :    1 .   the very narrow dip of the azimuthal velocity ( mean tangential wind ) in the center of the vortex , compared with the very large extension in space .",
    "this is characterized by the `` radius of the maximum tangential wind '' and this radius , as mentioned , is much smaller than the diameter of the vortex .",
    "our equation is able to generate solutions with this structure .",
    "2 .   the slow decay of the magnitude of the azimuthal velocity toward the periphery , compared with the very fast decay toward the center ;",
    "this is reproduced by the solutions of this equation .",
    "the very low magnitude ( almost vanishing ) of the vorticity over most of the vortex ( approx . from the radius of maximum wind to the periphery ) , while the magnitude in a narrow central region is extremely high .",
    "this feature is also reproduced by the equation .",
    "quantitatively , we obtain for the diameter of the typhoon s eye a relatively good magnitude . the vorticity is higher than in observations but not far from the realistic range .",
    "we have very encouraging results of studies on plasma vortices , but they are not reported here . in plasma physics , the symmetrical , stable , vortical structures observed in experiments in the linear machine seem to belong to the class of solutions of this equation .",
    "we have also obtained several solutions that are very similar to the crystals of vortices , known from experiments .",
    "the numerical solution of this equation appears to be very difficult .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the exponentials of the two functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are very rapidly - varying functions and any perturbation is amplified and propagated in the solution .",
    "in addition , the laplace operator has spurious solutions with exponential behavior that have to be eliminated by the numerical procedure .",
    "the paper of mcdonald @xcite on the numerical integration of the _ sinh_-poisson equation is very helpful in understanding the problems related to a numerical treatment of our equation .",
    "however the approach proposed in that paper requires to use a small mesh , specifically for excluding the spurious modes of the laplacean . in the case of our equation ,",
    "the vortices require a reasonable detailed description and this needs larger meshes .",
    "then the problem of the precision of integration procedure arises and , if the initialization happens to be far from one of the solution , the number of iteration of the solver is high and the errors accumulate , leading to lack of convergence .",
    "it may be supposed that the solutions would be similar to those of the _ sinh_-poisson equation , but structures with sharp spatial variation may be possible @xcite .",
    "the structure of the function space representing the union of attractors for the various solutions of this equation appears to be very complex .",
    "this immediately translates into serious obstacles in the attempt to reach one of the presumed solution .",
    "the main instrument is , naturally , the initialization , _",
    "i.e. _ to start the integration in the right subspace , representing the attractor of that solution .",
    "since there is no available analytical description of this space , the search is simply a problem of guessing a reasonable initial function and to repeat as many times as necessary .",
    "one of the specific behaviors is the tendency of driving the solution toward the constant value @xmath8 ( see eq.([bcon ] ) ) which trivially verifies the equation .",
    "this seems to imply that there is a large attractor in the function space around these constant solutions .",
    "the solution which is larger in absolute magnitude is less stable since any fluctuation around the constant generates high vorticity .",
    "we underline that the integrations described here are * not * radial ( _ i.e. _ unidimensional ) .    with all the difficulties of getting a right initial positioning in the integration procedure we note however that the solution with the _ typhoon _ morphology appears instistently from a wider class of initial shapes .",
    "we use the code `` * * giant * * a software package for the numerical solution of very large systems of highly nonlinear systems '' written by u. nowak and l. weimann @xcite .",
    "the code belongs to the numerical software library _ codelib _ of the * konrad zuse zentrum fur informationstechnik berlin*. the meaning of the abbreviation is : giant = global inexact affine invariant newton techniques and corresponds to the implementation of the method proposed by deuflhard ( for many references see @xcite ) .",
    "this code solves nonlinear problems @xmath9 the global affine invariant newton schemes requires the solution of linear problems . for higher accuracy",
    "meshes the linear problems are solved by iterative methods .",
    "the balance between numerical requirements of the newton iteration ( called _ outer _ iteration ) and the iterative linear solver ( _ inner _ ) means that the solution of the linear problem will be approximative .",
    "two packages of linear solvers can be used , gmres ( generalized minimum residual : brown , hindmarsh , seager ) and gbit1 ( fast secant method using the _ good - broyden _ updates : deuflhard , freund and walter ) .",
    "all necessary description of the method , of the code and many studies of the numerical precision and computer efficiency are presented by nowak and weimann in the documentation of the code .    the code has been implemented and the tests have been performed with successful results ( we are grateful to dr .",
    "weimann for his kind help in this problem ) .",
    "the boundary conditions are dependent on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the physical model imposes that the scalar function @xmath10 remains nonzero at infinity for @xmath11 .",
    "this means that we must require that the boundary condition is one of the roots of the algebraic equation @xmath12 which can give the vanishing of the physical vorticity at infinity",
    ". then we impose @xmath13      in general the initial profiles has been of two types : symmetric profiles with maximum centered on @xmath14 and initializations with functions expressed as product of trigonometric functions .",
    "the symmetric profiles has been chosen as gaussian functions , or various annular shapes .    for may runs , as suggested by the experiments for the _ sinh_-poisson equation ( paper by mcdonald @xcite ) ,",
    "the initial function is taken as a product of trigonometric functions in both directions , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we need to prepare the initial function in the sense that the values that are obtained in for the vorticity , _",
    "i.e. _ the laplacean of the initial distribution should not be too different of what is obtained by simply inserting the initial function in the nonlinear term .",
    "for this we take a coefficient @xmath17 of the product of the trigonometric functions as a parameter to be determined .",
    "the initial function is taken as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the periodicity of the profile and @xmath17 is the amplitude .",
    "we insert in the equation and we require approximative equality of the two parts , the vorticity and the nonlinearity .",
    "this is obtained by choosing a point @xmath20 where the initial function is maximum and it results a condition on only the amplitude , @xmath17 . @xmath21",

    "the experiments with simple @xmath22 functions frequently lead to difficulties of convergence .",
    "looking at the function s form ( either partial evolutions during iterations or good , converged , results ) we notice that the two - signed values are less tolerated and only one of the signs survives .",
    "this led us to adopt forms expressed as square of the trigonometric functions .",

    "the solution has an apparent cylindrical symmetry around the center and for this reason we present a section along @xmath15 of the streamfunction @xmath33 ( fig.([exp_7c ] ) ) .",

    "is irrelevant .",
    "however , the persistence of this state inside the iterative search may indicate that it is close to a solution , possible less stable .",
    "we have not investigated this further .",

    "at the point @xmath69 the equation becomes @xmath72 in the equation derivated at @xmath67 we replace @xmath73 with its value from the above equation and also introduce the parameter @xmath74 .",
    "then we have @xmath75 or @xmath76 this equation may serve to make some estimates if additional informations ( or simply hints from experiments ) are available .",
    "this is illustrated below .",
    "consider the case @xmath23@xmath77    a _ short and dirty _",
    "approximation should start by using the suggestion from results of lucky simulations , where @xmath78 is few units , and @xmath79 is of the order @xmath80 on a domain of length @xmath37 in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the second derivative of the tangential velocity must be high , shown by the plots of @xmath61 .",
    "this means that it may exist a difference of magnitude of the terms , with the second term in the right hand side appearing less important",
    ". therefore we try @xmath81 in addition , we can suppose that the exponentials of negative argument are less important than those of positive argument , and simplify to @xmath82 or @xmath83    for an order of magnitude we may take @xmath84 and then @xmath85 we obtain @xmath86 @xmath87 or @xmath88 we can see that the results are consistent , since if we take from numerical solution @xmath89 we obtain from the estimation @xmath90 which is not far from @xmath91 we must remember that the domain of integration is of length @xmath37 and the fact that `` the radius of maximum wind '' is so small , @xmath92 , means that high accuracy is needed to describe correctly what happens close to the center .",
    "this is due to the other constraint , that the solution streamfunction @xmath93 needs sufficient space to go to the constant value at `` infinity '' ( large @xmath67 ) .",
    "any restriction of the domain of integration which would be aimed to the better description of the central region would require boundary conditions that are unknown .",
    "there is another benefit from these very rough estimations .",
    "we can use them to determine the spatial domain that would be adequate for the search of the solution , for particular physical situations .    in order to use this rough estimation",

    "the plot indicates a maximum value of about @xmath108 .",
    "the vorticity we obtain is larger ( of the order of @xmath109 ) .",
    "this shows that the absence of the third dimension in our model and of the viscous effects have a serious influence on the physical quantities .",
    "they should be somehow accounted for by renormalizing the two - dimensional model at the initial stage .",
    "for example , in the case of the plasma vortex , a change of the space scale results from the presence of a translational motion combined with the density gradient .",
    "this remains to be studied .",
    "we again underline that this equation is very difficult to solve , although it requires reasonable computer resources .",
    "the main problem is the complexity of the space of solutions and the need to explore carefully much of this space in order to establish the basins of attraction .",
    "we are not able at this moment to connect in some practically useful way the sharp transitions between the attractors with the _ stability _ of the solutions .",
    "it seems that the solution where the streamfunction @xmath110 is approximately radially symmetric , strongly peaked in origin , is a significant attractor , at the level of this very sensitive equation .",
    "it presents the particularity that the vorticity is practically zero for almost all spatial domain and is strongly localised , almost singular , close to the maximum .",
    "the aspect of this solution is very similar to the two - dimensional image of a _",
    "typhoon_.    we have several arguments in favor of the conclusion that our equation ( [ eq ] ) may represent the hydrodynamic part of the atmospheric vortex .",
    "we mention some of them .    1 .   the profile of the magntitude of the tangential velocity , as represented in fig.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite is very similar to our fig.[vthlin_7 ] .",
    "this is also confirmed by similarity with the fig.1a from ref ( @xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "the profile of the vorticity @xmath36 shown in our fig.[omega_7 ] is very similar to fig.1a from ref.@xcite ; 3 .   we note that in  a series of reported numerical simulations , the tendency of the fields is to evolve toward profiles that are very close to those shown in our figures [ exp_7c ] , [ omega_7 ] and [ vthlin_7 ] .",
    "for example , the fig.7a and b of ref.@xcite show the evolution of the azimuthal mean of the vorticity and tangential velocity from initial profiles which correspond to a narrow ring of vorticity to profiles that show clear ressemblance with our figures [ omega_7 ] and [ vthlin_7 ] or [ vth_7a ] . the same striking evolution to profiles similar to ours appears in figs.7 a and b of the same reference .",
    "we have investigated whether a radially annular profile of vorticity can be a solution of our equation ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the result is negative , which may explain why such an initial profile evolves to either a set of vortices ( vortex - crystal ) or to a centrally peaked structure as in fig.[vth_7a ] .",
    "the four vortices represented in figure 4a of the ref .",
    "@xcite as the late stage of the evolution obtained from numerical simulation of vorticity , is clearly similar to our figure [ vel_3 ] .",
    "we obtain a good consistency between our quantitative results for an atmospheric vortex ( using most elementary input information ) and the values measured or obtained in numerical simulations , at least for some of the quantities .",
    "a large database on typhoons can be found in @xcite .",
    "the similarity is striking and it suggests that further work with this equation is worth to be done .",
    "the numerical simulations we have taken as a comparison are very complex . in general , the physics of the _ typhoons _ is very complex and includes hydrodynamics and thermic aspects , with many additional elements : precipitation , viscosity , etc . in no way we do not claim that this equation can represent this complexity .",
    "it appears however useful as a description of the regimes where the hydrodynamical processes are dominating and have reached stationarity .",
