    "the present note deals with the deuteron photo - disintegration and neutron induced polarization in the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4h reaction at low energy , from threshold up to about 30 mev . in this energy range ,",
    "the photo - disintegration process is dominated by the contributions of electric dipole ( @xmath5 ) and , to a much less but still significant extent , electric quadrupole ( @xmath6 ) transitions , connecting the deuteron to the @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath9p@xmath10 and @xmath9s@xmath11@xmath9d@xmath11 states , respectively .",

    "the total cross section data are from refs .",
    "@xcite , the angular distribution data at photon energy @xmath12=19.8 mev are from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the data on angular distribution ratios as function of @xmath12 are from ref .",
    "the calculations shown in these figures , various aspects of which are succintly summarized in the following section , are based on a variety of ( modern ) realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials , including the cd - bonn ( bonn )  @xcite , nijmegen i ( nijm - i )  @xcite , and argonne @xmath1 ( av18 )  @xcite , as well as on semi - realistic reductions of the av18  @xcite , the argonne @xmath13 ( av6 ) and argonne @xmath14 ( av8 ) models , constrained to reproduce the binding energy of the deuteron and the isoscalar combination of the s- and p - wave phase shifts . in particular , the av6 ignores spin - orbit interaction components , which are important in differentiating among the @xmath9p@xmath15 channels , and therefore does not provide a good fit to the phase shifts in these channels .",
    "the model dependence of all theoretical predictions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xs][fig : x_ratio ] , including those corresponding to the av6 and av8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] , is negligible .",
    "calculations of the @xmath7@xmath8 radiative capture cross section at thermal neutron energies , based on these same potential models , are also found to be in excellent agreement with the measured value , when two - body current contributions are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the model dependence is again negligible .",
    "the @xmath7@xmath8 radiative capture up to neutron energies of about 100 kev proceeds almost exclusively through the well - known magnetic dipole ( @xmath16 ) transition connecting the @xmath4s@xmath17 @xmath7@xmath8 and deuteron states  @xcite .    on the basis of these facts ,",
    "one is led to conclude that the @xmath16 and @xmath5 transition strengths , which the @xmath7@xmath8 radiative capture and deuteron photo - disintegration are selectively sensitive to at low energies , are both consistent with experimental data .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the neutron induced polarization ( @xmath0 ) in the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4h reaction originates predominantly , in the low - energy regime of interest here , from interference of @xmath16 and @xmath5 transition terms .",
    "thus , it is surprising to find that this observable , measured up to photon energies of 25 mev , is significantly overestimated , in magnitude , by theory , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : py_2.75][fig : py_45 ] , although the data at the ( center - of - mass ) angle of 135@xmath18 in fig .  [ fig : py_135 ] seem to be consistent with it .",

    "the discrepancy between theory and experiment is particularly severe for @xmath0 at @xmath19=45@xmath18 .",
    "that the @xmath0 data are problematic for theory has in fact been known for some time  @xcite . indeed , the main motivation for the present study was to re - examine this issue in light of the advances made during the last decade in the modeling of both nucleon - nucleon potentials and two - body electromagnetic currents .",

    "@xcite at @xmath19=90@xmath18and schmitt _ et al . _",

    "there is considerable scatter among the different data sets at @xmath19=90@xmath18 and in the measurements of the @xmath0 angular distribution at @xmath12=2.75 mev .",
    "clearly , more accurate data on both the energy dependence and angular distribution , which could be used to isolate the multipole components , are needed in order to resolve this confusing situation , and draw definite conclusions .",
    "the relevant matrix element in the photo - disintegration of a deuteron in spin projection @xmath20 initially at rest in the laboratory is    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the momentum of the absorbed photon and @xmath23,@xmath24 , are the spherical components of its polarization vector , @xmath25 is the nuclear electromagnetic current operator , and @xmath26 represents an @xmath7@xmath8 scattering state with total momentum @xmath22 and relative momentum @xmath27 , satisfying incoming wave boundary conditions .",

    "@xcite : they will not be discussed further here .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a second reference frame with axes @xmath31 ,",

    "is represented by the state    @xmath38    where @xmath39 denote the spin states with @xmath40 projections along @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "the transition amplitude for emission of a neutron with polarization in the @xmath37 direction is then obtained from the linear combination    @xmath42 \\ .\\ ] ]    a similar expression holds for emission of a neutron with polarization in the @xmath43 direction .",
    "the induced polarization @xmath0 is defined as    @xmath44    where the differential cross section is given by    @xmath45    here @xmath46 is the fine structure constant , @xmath47 is the nucleon mass , and the magnitude @xmath8 of the relative momentum is fixed by energy conservation .",
    "the polarization parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , proportional to cross - section differences for emission of neutrons with polarizations , respectively , in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 directions , vanish , as required by parity conservation , and this fact has been explicitly verified in the numerical calculations .",
    "the continuity equation allows one to express the nuclear electromagnetic current entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : jmin ] ) as  @xcite    @xmath52 \\ , \\label{eq : j_s}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is nuclear hamiltonian and @xmath54 is the nuclear charge density operator .",
    "this identity ensures that the siegert form is used for the @xmath5 operator , dominant in the energy regime of interest here .",
    "note that the matrix elements @xmath55 are calculated as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely without performing the expansion of @xmath25 in terms of electric and magnetic multipole operators .",
    "of course , the commutator term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jmin ] ) reduces to    @xmath56 \\rightarrow { \\rm i } q \\ , \\int{\\rm d}{\\bf x } \\ , { \\bf x } \\ , \\rho({\\bf x } ) \\equiv { \\rm i}\\ , q \\,{\\bf d}\\ , \\ ] ]    when evaluating the matrix elements .",
    "the dominant contribution @xmath57 to the electric dipole operator @xmath58 , to which the ( unretarded ) @xmath5 multipole operator is proportional , is simply given by    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the center - of - mass position vector and @xmath61 is the proton projector .",
    "however , there are a number of relativistic corrections which have been included in the present study , due to i ) the spin - orbit term in the single - nucleon charge density operator , ii ) the leading two - body contribution to @xmath54 , associated with pion exchange , and iii ) the center - of - energy correction .",
    "explicit expressions for the associated operators can be found in refs .",
    "in particular , the center - of - energy correction arises because translationally invariant wave functions require center - of - energy rather than center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "the correct electric dipole operator should be defined as    @xmath62    where    @xmath63    and ( for two particles )    @xmath64    this leads to a correction term to @xmath57 of the form    @xmath65 \\ , \\ ] ]    for transitions between states with zero @xmath28-component of the total isospin , @xmath66 is the pair total momentum .",
    "quantitatively , however , this as well as the spin - orbit and pion - exchange corrections to @xmath57 have been found to be rather small for @xmath12 up to 30 mev ( see below ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the @xmath67he(@xmath68)@xmath69li radiative capture , the matrix elements of @xmath57 vanish because of isospin selection rules ( and the use of translationally invariant wave functions ) , and the relativistic corrections above are responsible for the @xmath5 strength which dominates the cross section for this process at energies of 100 kev and below  @xcite .",
    "the two - body currents in the calculations based on the bonn and nijm - i potentials include the terms associated with @xmath70- and @xmath71-meson exchanges , @xmath72-excitation , and @xmath71@xmath70@xmath73 and @xmath74@xmath70@xmath73 transition mechanisms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the av18 calculation includes , in addition , the two - body currents associated with its momentum - dependent interaction components , as derived in ref .",
    "it should be emphasized that the av18 currents are exactly conserved .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : py_cmp ] is meant to illustrate the sensitivity of the @xmath75 results to various inputs in the calculation .",
    "the curves labeled av18 , av8 and av6 denote the results of calculations based on the av18 , av8 and av6 potentials , respectively , including one- and two - body currents  @xcite and the relativistic corrections to the electric dipole operator discussed above ( the curves labeled bonn , nijm - i and av18 in figs .  [ fig : xs][fig : py_135 ] are obtained in this same approximation scheme , while those labeled bonn ia , nijm - i ia , and av18 ia ignore two - body current contributions ) . as already emphasized , this polarization observable is not very sensitive to the input potential , even in the case of a semi - realistic one like the av6 .",
    "the curves labeled av18 ia and av18 ia w / o rc in e1 both represent av18-based results including only one - body currents , the difference being that in the av18 ia w / o rc in e1 calculation the relativistic corrections to @xmath76 are ignored , while in the av18 ia one they are retained . at the highest energy ,",
    "the associated contributions reduce ( in magnitude ) the av18 ia results by about 5% ( in the total cross section they decrease the av18 ia values by less than 1% over the whole @xmath12 range ) .",
    "the curve labeled av18 s+p shows the av18-based results obtained by including one- and two - body currents , but only s- and p - waves in the partial - wave expansion of the final @xmath7@xmath8 state . as can be seen by comparing the av18 and av18 s+p curves , the contributions of the higher partial waves to @xmath75 are substantial at the highest photon energies .",
    "lastly , the results denoted as av18 w / o m1 are obtained with the av18 , except that the contribution of the @xmath16 transition due to the @xmath4s@xmath17 state has been neglected .",
    "it demonstrates the sensitivity of the @xmath75 observable at @xmath19=90@xmath18 to this component of the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity persists at @xmath19=45@xmath18 and 135@xmath18 .",
    "note that the total cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] is reduced by less than 1% for @xmath12 in the 4 - 6 mev range .",
