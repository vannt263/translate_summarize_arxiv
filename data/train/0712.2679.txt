    "diffusive processes are commonplace in many systems of chemical , physical and biological interest @xcite , a fact commonly attributed to inherent randomness at the molecular level of dynamics ( thermal or otherwise ) and the wide range of applicability of the central limit theorem @xcite . in the context of biological systems",
    ", diffusion plays a key role in many of the processes of life at the cellular and sub - cellular levels @xcite .",
    "in particular , the diffusion of molecules on the surface of cells has received widespread attention for many years @xcite , both due to the clear consequences this motion has for cellular functioning as well as the availability of suitable experimental techniques to make quantitative measurements .",
    "developments in experimental techniques such as single - particle tracking @xcite , fluorescence photo - bleaching recovery @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite have made it possible to gain direct insight into the structure and dynamics of lipid membranes by investigating the lateral diffusion of lipids and integral membrane proteins @xcite .",
    "biological membranes are typically not flat , which leads to ambiguity in assigning the `` diffusion coefficient '' for a molecule on such a surface",
    ". do we mean the intrinsic curvilinear diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 , that would be expected if the molecule were moving over a truly flat surface , or do we mean the effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath1 , reflecting projected motion of the particle onto a reference plane ( see fig .",

    "most experiments , including optical techniques and nmr @xcite , directly measure @xmath1 , while traditional theories provide a route to estimation of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is the focus of this paper .",
    "it is well appreciated that confining a particle to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface within a three - dimensional ( 3d ) space has the effect of lowering the effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath1 , relative to the curvilinear value , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recently , this geometric effect has seen renewed interest in the context of diffusion over lipid bilayers and biomembranes @xcite . reflecting the diversity of membrane structures present in biology ,",
    "some studies have focused interest on the case of a particle diffusing over a static membrane @xcite , while others have concentrated on membranes with fast dynamic fluctuations @xcite . for certain biological structures ,",
    "the static membrane ( quenched disorder ) limit is probably a good one .",
    "for example , the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) @xcite and the lateral cortex of auditory outer hair cells @xcite are oddly shaped in a predominantly static fashion due to topology of the membrane and interactions with other cellular components .",
    "other systems , like reconstituted unilamellar vesicles @xcite and the plasma membrane of the red blood cell @xcite are expected to fluctuate rapidly , which motivated reister and seifert to consider the fast shape - fluctuation ( annealed disorder ) limit in the context of membrane protein diffusion @xcite .",
    "the annealed disorder limit is especially attractive for theoretical study , since spatial correlations of the membrane surface drop out in this limit and analytical results are readily obtained @xcite .",
    "more generally , membrane systems may fall in an intermediate regime where membrane motion and diffusive transport share comparable characteristic time scales .    while the annealed disorder limit is well understood ,",
    "the opposite limit of quenched disorder is less established .",

    "outside the field of biological physics , general simulation strategies have been suggested for the evolution of diffusive particles over curved surfaces of arbitrary complexity @xcite . while these methods can be applied to membrane systems , in many cases of interest they are more elaborate and computationally expensive than necessary .",
    "commonly , biomembrane surfaces are described in the monge gauge .",

    "this paper presents a 2d langevin equation for diffusive particle motion over a curved monge - gauge surface that may be static or fluctuating in time .",
    "the numerical implementation of this equation leads to simulations of increased efficiency relative to the more general 3d random - walk methodology of holyst et al .",
    "simulations are carried out here for surfaces with lateral periodicity .    in the quenched limit",
    ", simulation results for a variety of differently - shaped surfaces ( periodic in a box of linear dimension @xmath5 ) suggest that the ratio between the projected and the curvilinear diffusion coefficients is equal to the ratio of projected membrane area , @xmath6 , to actual curvilinear membrane area , @xmath7 ( to within the precision we are able to achieve numerically ) .",
    "that is , @xmath8 for static monge - gauge surfaces .",
    "these results directly refute an earlier claim of non - integer scaling with surface area @xcite and disprove the suggestion @xcite that the effective medium approximation should be the most accurate approximation available for predicting @xmath1 from @xmath0 .    to examine the effects of dynamic surface fluctuations , we consider helfrich elastic membranes with thermal dynamics described by a generalized continuum langevin equation @xcite . as a general trend",
    ", we show that the ratio @xmath9 grows with increasing membrane fluctuation rates . a particle moving on a slowly fluctuating membrane exhibits @xmath1 approaching the quenched disorder limit discussed above , while fast membrane fluctuations effect @xmath1 values limiting to the somewhat larger annealed limit results discussed previously @xcite . for a membrane of given rigidity ,",
    "the crossover between these two regimes is controlled by a dimensionless parameter @xmath10 , which represents the ratio between characteristic particle diffusion time and membrane shape - relaxation time scale in a hydrodynamic medium of viscosity @xmath11 .",

    "[ fig : dvschi ] , this corresponds to a value of @xmath280 . for smaller bending rigidities , this crossover point tends to larger values of @xmath14 ( as may already be seen from figure [ fig : dvsk_varchi ] ) , reflecting stronger quenched effects .",

    "we have applied this equation numerically ( using brownian dynamics simulation techniques ) to several different examples of a static as well as a dynamic surface .",
    "as shown , the dynamical state of the coupled particle - membrane system may be described by a dynamical coupling parameter , @xmath293 ( with @xmath11 being the medium viscosity , @xmath5 the system size , and @xmath0 the particle curvilinear diffusion coefficient ) , that controls the separation of characteristic time scales for particle diffusion and membrane relaxation .",

    "the present findings call for a more detailed analysis of diffusion over two - dimensional surfaces , and in particular , an analytical explanation that can clarify the unanticipated success of area - scaling in the quenched disorder limit .    in view of the fact that many biological structures exhibit large static undulations ( as in the endoplasmic reticulum @xcite and the lateral cortex of auditory outer hair cells @xcite ) , it is important to realize that the annealed result may not be applied to these system .",

    "this is more pronounced for strongly roughened membranes that may be represented by small bending rigidity ( and surface tension ) . for vanishing bending rigidity",

    "the surface is almost planar and all different theoretical predictions converge to @xmath297 , with deviations of only a few percent for @xmath298 .",
    "this is why we have extensively studied the low bending rigidity regime in order to emphasize the physical mechanisms which affect the diffusion coefficient .",
    "an important advantage of the present langevin approach is that it can be easily generalized to include particle - particle and membrane - particle interactions ( as in the case of active protein inclusions @xcite , where  unlike the present case ",
    "membrane dynamics are directly influenced by forces exerted by the proteins ) .",
    "this will enable numerical investigation of more complex and realistic models of biological membranes .    as a final note , we comment on some of the physics absent from the present study .",
    "this work considers the influence of surface shape on the diffusion process solely through the geometric effect of projection onto a base plane .",
    "we have neglected any effects whereby surface shape may alter the local character of the surface and the value of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the curvature of a lipid bilayer may influence the value of @xmath0 itself @xcite and we have neglected this effect . in the case of fluid lipid bilayers , it is clear that surface fluctuations must be accompanied by a local flow of lipids as membrane material is moved about .",
    "such flows would be expected to drive particle motion and lead to correlations between membrane fluctuations and protein transport .",
