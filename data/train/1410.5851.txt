    "randomized libraries are widely used to select novel proteins with specific biological and physiochemical properties .",
    "there are many protocols to create randomized libraries @xcite , such as cassette mutagenesis and error - prone pcr ( eppcr ) . in the cassette mutagenesis ,",
    "random mutagenesis is generated in a particular region or regions of the target gene through incorporation of degenerate synthetic dna sequence .",
    "usually equal molar nucleotides are used ( @xmath1 ratio of nucleotides ) , but on other occasions , different molar ratios of nucleotides in the mixtures are used to create predetermined physiochemical properties in the targeted region(s ) . for example , in the study of selection and characterization of small transmembrane proteins that bind and activate the platelet - derived growth factor @xmath2 ( pdgf @xmath2 ) receptor , fifteen transmembrane amino acids of e5 protein of bovine papillomavirus ( bpv ) were replaced with random sequences  @xcite .",
    "the following library design was used to mimic the hydrophobic transmembrane region of bpv e5 protein : @xmath3 where the three ` nxr ` codons are followed by a ` caa ` codon encoding glutamine , which in turn is followed by 12 more ` nxr ` codons . for the ` nxr ` codons , ` n ` stands for an equal mix of ` a ` , ` c ` , ` g ` , and ` t ` , ` x ` is a @xmath4 mixture of ` t : c ` , and ` r ` is an equal mix of ` a ` and ` g ` .    in order to guide and evaluate randomized library construction",
    ", the statistical properties of the libraries will be useful .",
    "one of the most asked questions is the number of unique sequences in the library ( the complexity of the library ) . in the following we are going to give some formulas to calculate the expected number of unique sequences in the library as well as its variance .",
    "our treatment is different from previous works in several ways @xcite .",
    "firstly , the previous works deal with only mixtures of equal molar ratio of the four nucleotides , while we can handle mixtures of arbitrary user - defined molar ratios , which is more useful in such situations as described above . as shown in the examples below",
    ", the different molar ratios in the nucleotide mixtures make a significant difference in the statistics of the library .",
    "secondly , we present a formula for the variance , and hence the standard deviation , of the number of unique sequences in the library .",
    "the standard deviation gives an indication of the spread of the distribution around the expected value .",
    "thirdly , by using a mathematical software library that can handle arbitrary numerical precision , we can calculate the statistics for much larger libraries .",
    "the statistics of library with mutations in more than @xmath0 amino acids can be calculated easily .",
    "the program can be accessed freely in the web server at http://graphics.med.yale.edu/cgi-bin/lib_comp.pl .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the _ theory _ section we derive the formulas for the expected number of unique sequences in the randomized library and its variance . within the assumption of the model ,",
    "the formulas are exact . for real calculations of randomized libraries , however , these formulas have to be rearranged due to the huge number of possible sequences . in _ software implementation _",
    "section we discuss several ways to make the calculation manageable while keeping the numerical accuracy of the calculation . in the last section two examples are given for a small library and a relatively bigger library .",
    "assume that the size of the library ( the number of transformants ) is @xmath5 and the total number of all possible sequences is @xmath6 .",
    "usually @xmath6 is a huge number for a large randomized library .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 nucleotide bases are mutated , the number of potential sequences is @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the probability of sequence @xmath9 as @xmath10 . for each sequence",
    "@xmath9 among these possible sequences , we can associate a random variable @xmath11 , which is either @xmath12 or @xmath13 , according as the sequence @xmath9 is or is not in the library . the respective probabilities of @xmath11 to take these two values are :    [ e : xi ] @xmath14    the _ number of unique sequences _ in the library is given by the random variable @xmath15 : @xmath16    the properties that we are interested in are the average ( expectation ) of @xmath15 and its variance .",
    "the expectation gives the average of the number of distinct sequences in the library , and the variance shows the tightness of the distribution of the number of distinct sequences around its average .",
    "the average is given by the expectation of @xmath15 as @xmath17 and its variance is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _ covariance _ of @xmath11 and @xmath20 : @xmath21    from eq .",
    "we know that both @xmath22 and @xmath23 equal to @xmath24 : @xmath25 @xmath26 hence the variance of @xmath11 is @xmath27 to calculate @xmath28 we need @xmath19 , which in turn depends on @xmath29 .",
    "the joint probability distribution of @xmath11 and @xmath20 are given by @xmath30 from the joint probability the expectation of @xmath31 can be obtained as @xmath32 from which we obtain the covariance of @xmath11 and @xmath20 as @xmath33 putting all the pieces together we have the average and variance of @xmath15 as @xmath34,\\ ] ] and @xmath35   \\notag \\\\   & = \\sum_{i=1}^n { v}_i - \\left [ \\sum_{i=1}^n { v}_i \\right]^2   + 2 \\sum_{i > j } { w}_{ij } \\notag \\\\   & = \\sum_{i=1}^n ( 1 - p_i)^{l}- \\left [ \\sum_{i=1}^n ( 1 - p_i)^{l}\\right]^2   + 2 \\sum_{i > j } ( 1 - p_i - p_j)^{l}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "when the number of possible sequences @xmath36 is small , the average and variance of the unique sequences in the library can be calculated directly using eqs .   and .",
    "when @xmath36 becomes large , however , a direct calculation is not feasible . if in one position along the sequence we have @xmath37 possibilities ( for nucleotide @xmath37 usually is @xmath38 ) , and we have mutation in @xmath39 such positions , a direct calculation would have @xmath40 possible values of @xmath10 , which , as stated earlier , is too big to tackle directly .",
    "not all these @xmath10 , however , are unique . for a particular mixture ratio of ` x ` , we can calculate the probability @xmath41 of each nucleotide in that position from the nucleotide ratio , which is just the fraction of each nucleotide at positions with mixture ratio ` x ` .",
    "for example , if the ratio is @xmath42 for ` a ` , ` c ` , ` g ` , and ` t ` , then @xmath41 will take values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath54 , can be reduced if there is degeneracy among @xmath41 : @xmath55 where we combine terms of @xmath56 of the same value together ( there are @xmath57 of them ) : @xmath58 are just unique items among @xmath41 . in such cases the number of unique probabilities of @xmath10 is given by @xmath59 for example , if we want to mutate nucleotide acids in @xmath60 positions with nucleotide ratio @xmath61 , then @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the brute force calculation would have to add up @xmath65 terms .",
    ".   gives @xmath66 , while eq .",
    "gives @xmath67 , a significant reduction .",
    "the above statements apply to mutations with a single base composition , as in @xmath68 .",
    "they can , however , be generalized easily to handle multiple base compositions , as in @xmath69 .",
    "for example , the mutation in can be written as @xmath70 for the computation purpose . in this general situation ,",
    "the unique probabilities @xmath10 and its associated coefficient @xmath71 are given by the expansion of the product @xmath72    a c program has been written that uses eqs   and to calculate the average and variance of the number of unique sequences in randomized libraries , where @xmath71 and @xmath10 are from the expansion of eq .  .",
    "for small libraries , numerical accuracy is not a problem : standard programming languages are sufficient to give correct answers . for large libraries",
    ", careful attention has to be paid to the numerical stability , since there are many terms involved , and each term of probability @xmath10 is very small , as @xmath10 is the product of many @xmath73 raised to high power .",
    "standard programming languages like c usually can not handle the situation well .    to overcome the issue of numerical accuracy ,",
    "the program links the library of pari / gp package @xcite , which can do numerical calculations with arbitrary precisions .",
    "furthermore , the package has the ability to do symbolic calculations , which makes some of the above mentioned calculations easier",
    ". a web server has been set up to access the program at http://graphics.med.yale.edu/cgi-bin/lib_comp.pl .",
    "the program is simple to use .",
    "the user just type in the library size @xmath5 and the nucleotide ratios of the mixtures , followed by the number of bases with that nucleotide ratio , separated by a space .",
    "multiple ratios of the mixtures can be handled .",
    "if one or more of the nucleotides is not included at a position , simply exclude them in the input ( although including them as zeros does not hurt : the program filters them out automatically ) .",
    "for example , to calculate the complexity for the library as described in eq .",
    "in the _ introduction _ section , user input for the nucleotide ratios and base numbers is in the format of : @xmath74",
    "in this section two artificial examples are given to show the effects of different molar ratios of the nucleotide mixtures on the statistics of the library .",
    "the first example is a small randomized library with mutations on two amino acids , with different nucleotide mixture ratios for the first , second , and third codon positions : @xmath75 .",
    "here we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the potential number of sequences is @xmath78 .",
    "the second library is relatively larger , with mutations in @xmath79 amino acids : @xmath80 .",
    "here we have @xmath76 and @xmath81 .",
    "the potential number of sequences is @xmath82 .",
    "three different sets of molar ratios are used for each library : @xmath83 set 3 , though not very common in practice , is included to show the effects of nucleotide molar ratio on the library statistics .    the average and standard deviation ( square root of the variance ) of the number of unique sequences in the libraries",
    "are shown in figures  [ f:2aa ] and [ f:8aa ] as a function of @xmath5 , the size of the library ( or the number of transformants ) . from these figures",
    "we can see that the nucleotide ratios of the mixtures have a significant impact on the statistics .",
    "as expected , for both small and large libraries , libraries with equimolar ratios achieve a larger number of unique library members @xmath84 with the same library size @xmath85 than libraries with unequal ratios . on average",
    "it requires more transformants for the libraries with unequal ratio mixtures to include the same number of unique sequences .",
    "for example , for the small library shown in figure  [ f:2aa ] , the library with equal ratio mixtures ( set 1 ) will have an average number of unique sequences @xmath86 ( the theoretical limit ) at @xmath87 , while the library with unequal ratio mixtures set 2 needs a larger library size @xmath88 to get the same average number of unique sequences , and the library with a more skewed ratio mixtures set 3 needs @xmath89 .",
    "however , the ability to calculate precise library statistics allows one to more accurately assess the disadvantages of reduced library complexity against the advantages of selection for particular amino acids ( e.g. hydrophobic amino acids ) by using skewed nucleotide ratios .",
    "it should be mentioned that the nucleotide complexity considered here is not necessarily the same thing as amino acid complexity , due to the codon degeneracy .",
    "the standard deviation also behaves differently according to the difference in mixture ratios . for equal ratio ,",
    "the standard deviation has a sharp peak , centered around the point where the mean is about @xmath90 of the satuation . for unequal ratios , however ,",
    "the distributions of standard deviation is broad and multimodal , and the peaks shift to the higher @xmath5 . for large libraries ,",
    "the standard deviation is quite small when compared with the mean .",
    "the number of peaks in the standard deviation depends on the number of distinct sequence probabilities @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , if all @xmath36 probabilities are distinct , there will be @xmath91 peaks in the standard deviation . if these peaks from the left to the right are labeled from @xmath12 to @xmath91 , then the peak @xmath92 is associated with the fluctuation of the number of unique sequences in the transition from @xmath93 to @xmath94 as @xmath5 increases .",
    "when some or all sequence probabilities become degenerate , the peaks in the standard deviation will merge together . in the extreme case of equal ratios , all peaks merge into one peak and the standard deviation becomes single - modal .",
