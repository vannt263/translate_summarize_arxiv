    "the growth of the internet has provided economists , marketers , and statisticians with a potentially rich and informative data source .  since everything on the internet is necessarily digital , all activity can be easily recorded and stored in a database for future examination .",
    "this data has found disparate uses , from advertisement targeting to law enforcement .",
    "one prevalent but relatively under used example of such data is clickstream data .",
    "this data consists of each website visited by a panel of users and the order in which they arrive at the sites .",
    "it is often accompanied by the time of arrival at and departure from the site as well as the degree of activity at the site and the demographic characteristics of the users .",
    "examples of companies that collect clickstream data based on broad panels are netratings inc . ,",
    "mediametrix inc . , and plurimus corp .",
    "this paper uses data from plurimus corp . to analyze user choice of internet portals .",
    "it will show that commonly used econometric models for examining grocery scanner data can be applied to clickstream data on advertising - based online markets .",
    "a portal is a launching pad to the internet .",
    "portals , such as yahoo , lycos , and msn , are sometimes referred to as search engines .",
    "adar and huberman ( 1999 p. 2 ) describe them as `` a refinement of the web search engine service '' .",
    "portals have search engine capabilities , but they also have other features .",
    "these may include email , news , and a link - based directory to the web separate from the search service .",
    "there are few , if any , pure search engines remaining .  in this paper ,",
    "i am interested in the portal as a starting point and not as a destination .",
    "therefore i look at the use of portal main pages , directory pages , and search pages , but not at email , news , and shopping pages .",
    "the methodology used here closely mimics that of guadagni and little s ( 1983 ) paper that estimates a multinomial logit model with scanner data to examine consumer coffee purchases .",
    "it shows that the model has reasonably good out - of - sample predictive ability .",
    "furthermore , informative simulations can be conducted on the effects on market share of changing a variable .",
    "for example , it can derive an estimate of the impact on number of visits of increasing advertising by one dollar .",
    "the results , however , have to be interpreted with caution",
    ".  the data does not satisfy the independent of irrelevant alternatives assumption made in the model .",
    "this assumption implies that there is no correlation between the alternatives outside of the observed variables .  when this assumption fails , estimating switching behavior becomes difficult .",
    "the coefficients and the simulation results will therefore have some bias .",
    "future work will apply the techniques of more recent developments in the econometric analysis of panel data to the internet portal market .",
    "this will alleviate the above problem .",
    "guadagni and little take advantage of the richness of their data set by treating each purchase as a separate observation .",
    "those few studies that have used clickstream data thus far ( such as goldfarb ( 2000a ) , moe and fader ( 2000 ) , sandvig ( 2000 ) ) , have aggregated the data to a market share level .",
    "while this has provided interesting insights into specific problems , it is not the best approach to understanding website choice and the causes of website shares within a given market .",
    "aggregating the data deletes considerable relevant information .",
    "important determinants of website choice include an individual s past experience at a site and the site that the individual went to the previous time .",
    "unlike most other marketing studies using choice - specific data , there is no monetary price here .",
    "goettler and shachar ( 1999 ) also examine a consumer panel that faces no price consisting of individual choices of television shows .    developing a framework to study consumer choices of free ( advertising - supported ) websites",
    "is an essential step to better understanding user behavior on the internet .  according to the data set used in this study ,",
    "more than two - thirds of all consumer internet traffic is at advertising - supported sites .",
    "with the exceptions of amazon and ebay , the top twenty sites in terms of unique visitors are all advertising - supported .",
    "the literature on this important aspect of the internet is sparse .",
    "three studies that focus on advertising - supported websites are adar and huberman ( 1999 ) , gandal ( 2001 ) , and goldfarb ( 2000a ) .",
    "adar and huberman ( 1999 ) show that portals can discriminate between users as those looking for certain topics are willing to spend more time .",
    "this means that search engines can capture more consumer surplus ( in the form of advertising revenue ) , but forcing consumers that are willing to spend more time to view more pages and advertisements .",
    "gandal ( 2001 ) examines market share at an aggregate level to try to examine the portal market .",
    "he finds that early entrants have an advantage and that certain features matter more than others .",
    "goldfarb ( 2000a ) examines concentration levels in advertising - supported internet markets .",
    "lynch and ariely ( 2000 ) is one of few internet studies that looks at choice - specific data .",
    "they construct a simulated environment for the purchase of wine and examine purchase choice .  like lynch and ariely s study ,",
    "this paper takes advantage of the choice - specific data .  unlike their study , i look at the choice of free web sites using actual user clickstreams .",
    "the main data for this study was supplied by plurimus corporation .",
    "it is a clickstream data set consisting of every website visited by 2654 users from december 27 1999 to march 31 2000 .",
    "it also contains data on the time of arrival at and departure from each site .  in total , the data set contains 3,228,595 website visits , of which 859,587 ( 2622 people ) are to internet portals .  using this data ,",
    "i construct measures of past search success , past time spent searching , whether a site is an individual s starting page , whether an individual has an email account at the site , and the number of pages viewed at each site .",
    "a considerable section of this paper is dedicated to explaining the construction of these variables from the raw data .",
    "many of the decisions were based on a questionnaire conducted in june 2000 ( see goldfarb 2000b for further details ) .",
    "i link the plurimus data to monthly advertising spending data from j. walter thompson company and media mentions data found through the lexis - nexis academic universe .",
    "the next section of the paper will describe the application of the methodology used by guadagni and little to the present problem .",
    "section three will describe the data set , the questionnaire used to inform data construction , the actual process of data construction , and summary statistics .  section four will present the results , test the model s predictive ability , and examine market response to changes in the control variables .",
    "the paper will conclude by summarizing the key results and proposing several potential areas for future research .",
    "internet users choose which website to visit just as they make several other economic choices :  given the alternatives available and the information they have about those alternatives , they choose the alternative that will give them the highest utility .  in terms of grocery products such as coffee ( studied by guadagni and little )",
    ", this means that households buy the product that has the best attributes for the lowest price .  in terms of portals",
    ", this means that households will use the portal that will allow them to maximize the probability of finding what they seek and minimizing the time spent .",
    "conceptually , i assume households are exogenously given a `` goal '' when they go online .",
    "i explore this assumption in the questionnaire part of this paper and in goldfarb ( 2000b ) .",
    "they go to the portal that they expect will help them achieve that goal in the least time with the most accuracy .    in the multinomial logit model , the expected utility of the portal is based on past history , several website characteristics ( that may vary over time ) , outside influences such as advertising and media mentions , and an idiosyncratic error term .",
    "formally , household @xmath0 visits website @xmath1 at choice occasion @xmath2 when @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .  here @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 @xmath7 may include variables that change over any or all of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath8 may vary over @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 , implying household heterogeneity , brand heterogeneity , time ( choice occasion ) heterogeneity or any combination of the three .  in this study",
    ", @xmath7 will never vary over just @xmath2 , just @xmath9 just @xmath2 and @xmath9 or just @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "it will vary over just @xmath1 in the form of portal - specific dummy variables .",
    "@xmath8 will be assumed constant .",
    "future work will look at heterogeneity across households in @xmath8 .",
    "there are @xmath10 households , @xmath11 websites , @xmath12 choice occasions for each household , and @xmath13 total choice occasions .",
    "it is expected utility to the user , not to the observer , that is of interest .",
    "it is assumed that the user knows @xmath14 .",
    "the expectation is taken over relevant variables that the user may not know the value of before visiting the website .",
    "for example , the user does not know how long she will spend on the website .",
    "she does , however , have an expectation of how long it will take based on her past experience at that website .    in order to get the multinomial logit form , the @xmath14 are assumed to be independently distributed random variables with a type ii extreme value distribution .  given the above assumptions , the probability of household @xmath0 choosing brand @xmath1 at choice occasion @xmath2 can be expressed as : @xmath15 the model , as expressed above is a combination of theil s ( 1969 ) multinomial logit and mcfadden s ( 1974 ) conditional logit .",
    "it is commonly referred to as a mixed logit or as a multinomial logit .  since this paper assumes @xmath16",
    "is fixed , the model here is a conditional logit .",
    "the log likelihood function is as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is equal to one if alternative @xmath1 is chosen by individual @xmath19 at time @xmath2 , and is equal to zero otherwise .",
    "a significant potential problem with this framework is that it implies an assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives ( iia ) .",
    "if a household is offered a new alternative that is almost identical to one of the current alternatives , say @xmath20 , then this new alternative should be expected to only draw buyers from @xmath20 ; however , under iia , the new alternative draws buyers from all the other alternatives .",
    "i test for and reject the assumption of iia in section 4 .",
    "this is a significant problem that will be addressed in future work by allowing for household heterogeneity .    in this model",
    ", the researcher observes the choice by each household on each choice occasion .",
    "let @xmath21 if household @xmath0 chooses website @xmath1 on choice occasion @xmath2 and let @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "the researcher also observes the characteristics of each website at that choice occasion for that household @xmath7 .",
    "the main data set consists of 3,228,595 website visits by 2654 households from december 27 , 1999 to march 31 2000 .  also included in the initial data set was the time of arrival at and departure from a website , the beginning and end of each online session , and the number of pages visited at that site .",
    "this data , collected by plurimus corporation , was used to construct a data set of 859,587 portal choices by 2622 households .",
    "this study uses only 2008 of these households and keeps the others to test the model out of sample .",
    "furthermore , it only looks at the eight most frequently used portals comprising eighty percent of all portal visits",
    ".  therefore the final data set consists of 519,705 portal choices by 2005 households .",
    "plurimus has an anonymizing technology that allows them to collect information about users without needing the users permission .",
    "plurimus avoids significant privacy concerns because the users are anonymous and the data can not be traced to any actual person .",
    "they are regularly audited by pricewaterhousecoopers in order to ensure they exceed the privacy requirements of the fcc guidelines .",
    "unlike volunteer panel data , behavioral records from anonymized users are not biased by the wish to be seen in a socially desirable light .  moreover , there is no selection bias into the sample itself , yielding a sample from a broader spectrum of socioeconomic status than is typically available from panel studies .",
    "this data , however , has five limitations that need to be considered when extending the results of this study to the entire internet .",
    "first , the geographic distribution of the sample is considerably biased .",
    "new york , chicago , and los angeles are under - represented .",
    "roughly half the sample comes from the pittsburgh area .",
    "another quarter is from north carolina and another eighth is from tampa .",
    "this problem is not as severe as it may first appear because portals are a national product .",
    "the second limitation is that it does not collect data on america online ( aol ) users .",
    "since aol subscribers make up roughly 50% of all american home internet users , this could bias the results .",
    "aol , however , provides a different product from the other internet service providers .",
    "aol users are encouraged to stay within the gated aol community and they generally do not venture out onto the rest of the internet . moreover , preliminary surveys commissioned by plurimus show that when aol users do leave the gated aol community , they have similar habits to other web users .  this data limitation will , however , put a downward bias on visits to the aol portal .",
    "third , the data contains information on few users at work .",
    "online habits at work are likely different from those at home ; however according to a study by nie and erbring ( 2000 ) , 64.3% of internet users use the internet primarily at home ; just 16.8% use it primarily at work .",
    "few data sets , however , contain reliable at work panel data .",
    "table 1 compares unique visitors as a fraction of yahoo s users for the eight portals used in this study as estimated by several companies .",
    "i chose to use a base of comparison because the numbers vary as a result of the assumed online population .",
    "i use unique visitors rather than total visits because that was the data that was available from the other companies .",
    "the number of unique visitors for a month to a website is the number of different households that go to a given website over the course of the month .",
    "some of the variation between the methodologies may be a result of exactly which webpages are considered part of the main site .",
    "the data in the table is website - specific ( not internet property - based ) meaning , for example , that yahoosports is not considered to be a part of yahoo .",
    "i could not find website based results for media metrix in march or for nielsen / netratings in any month .  with the exception of aol , plurimus s numbers are well within the range of the other companies , and",
    "therefore the above issues with the data may not be important for understanding portal choice by users who are not aol subscribers .",
    "the fourth limitation is that the data is collected at the household level rather than at the individual level .  if two people in a given household have considerably different habits this will show up as one person with widely varying habits .  while this makes it difficult to assess the extent of learning over time , it is a standard problem in consumer panels .",
    "fifth , it does not contain information on households from the first time they go online .",
    "therefore initial conditions are potentially a problem .",
    "although the observations may not be independently and identically distributed , this problem may be partially alleviated by the law of large numbers due to the number of observations per household in the data set .",
    "more than 79% of the households in the final data set make 30 or more choices .",
    "the mean household makes 259 portal choices and the median household makes 120 portal choices .",
    "together , these five data limitations mean that results should be extended to different geographic distributions , aol users , and at work users with caution .",
    "furthermore , the fourth and fifth limitations mean that understanding learning behavior is not possible .",
    "i join this clickstream data set with two other data sets .",
    "the first is an advertising data set provided by j. walter thompson company .",
    "this data set consists of all advertising spending by each of the portals used in this study on a monthly basis .",
    "the spending is determined by a thorough sampling of television , radio , newspaper , magazine , outdoor , and internet advertising by each of the portals .  the number of advertisements is then multiplied by the average cost of advertising in each medium ( at the program level in television and the issue level in magazines ) .",
    "since this data is not individual - specific , it will likely underestimate the impact of advertising .  the methodology used in this paper , however , can easily be adapted to individual - specific advertising data .",
    "i also constructed a data set of ` media mentions ' for each of the relevant companies .  if a company is mentioned on network television news ( abc , cbs , or nbc ) , in the wall street journal , in the new york times , or in usa today on a given day or the day before then the media mentions variable is equal to one .",
    "otherwise it is equal to zero .",
    "unfortunately , i do not know which individuals were actually watching or reading which media .",
    "it is likely , however , that mentions in these media are highly correlated with mentions in other media such as local newspapers .    in the data set several dozen portals",
    "are observed to be chosen .  for computational feasibility ,",
    "i limit the number of portals to the eight with the most visits ( in order ) : yahoo , microsoft network ( msn ) , netscape , excite , aol , altavista , iwon , and lycos .",
    "these eight make up eighty percent of all visits and all sites with more than 2.5% of total visits .",
    "there was a natural break after lycos because the ninth most visited portal , myway , is a site that is the default of several internet service providers and is rarely chosen as anything but a start - up page .",
    "go.com is not included because , although it is commonly ranked in the top five portals , a large percentage of those visits are to destination websites such as espn.com , disney.com , and mrshowbiz.com .  the go.com",
    "portal page itself ranks tenth in total visits and ninth in unique visits .",
    "qualitative results , however , do not change with the addition of more portals .",
    "future work will explore methodologies that allow for the inclusion of a larger number of portals .",
    "there were several issues related to analyzing a clickstream data set that did not have obvious answers .",
    "i conducted an email - based survey of internet search habits to help resolve these issues .",
    "using surveys to inform data interpretation is relatively rare in economics .",
    "helper ( 2000 ) asserts that economists should use more surveys and field research in order to better understand data .",
    "she emphasizes that this type of research `` allows exploration of areas with little preexisting data or theory '' ( p. 228 ) .",
    "analysis of clickstream data certainly qualifies as one such area .",
    "manski ( 2000 ) recommends questionnaires to elicit agents preferences and expectations directly .",
    "jaffe , trajtenberg , and fogarty ( 2000 ) use surveys to determine whether patent citations are a good proxy variable for communication .  in other words",
    "they use a survey to determine how to interpret a data set .  in this paper ,",
    "i use a survey to determine how derive variables such as search success from raw clickstream data .",
    "further details on the questionnaire are in goldfarb ( 2000b )      the survey was sent to each participant as an email attachment in microsoft word template format .  in the accompanying email",
    ", i explained that i was a doctoral student in economics studying internet habits .",
    "respondents came from two groups .",
    "the first group , henceforth referred to as the ` spammed ' group , consists of the 34 respondents to unsolicited email .",
    "the second group of respondents consisted of 23 ` friends of friends ' .",
    "after receiving a response rate of roughly three percent , i decided to augment my numbers by asking several friends and family members to forward the survey to their mailboxes .  when there is sufficient data , i present results in this paper for the 34 ` spammed ' respondents and for the 57 in the total sample .",
    "clearly , this is a biased sample and can not be used to conduct classical statistics .",
    "it can , however , be used to inform myths , suggest ideas , and suggest stories .",
    "the survey results are quite informative about individual surfing habits .  by observing a biased sample of people ,",
    "i can follow the search process more closely than i can with a broader sample .",
    "it is common practice in psychology and in experimental economics to draw candidates from undergraduate classes , and then to use this information to inform theory .",
    "the survey itself asks respondents to search for driving directions , medical information , an mp3 , and something of their own choosing .",
    "respondents then answered several questions about the searches ( see the appendix for a copy of the full questionnaire ) .",
    "the search tasks were chosen to be diverse and to reflect common search activities .",
    "the survey also asks several questions about user internet habits .",
    "two of the issues addressed in the questionnaire are particularly important to this paper .",
    "the first is determining which variables are relevant to an analysis of search engine competition ( and hence which variables to construct and include in the study ) .",
    "the second is how to determine whether a given search fails .",
    "other issues addressed include whether faster search is more desirable , and whether habits differ at the second search engine in a given search from those at the first .",
    "there are many potential relevant variables for analysis .",
    "the survey asked which pages individuals bookmarked and what was each individual s starting page .",
    "individuals rarely bookmarked portals , and those that were bookmarked were rarely used in the actual search part of the questionnaire .  on the other hand , start pages were found to play an important role in site choice .",
    "the survey also asked respondents to give reasons why they preferred their favorite portal .",
    "the only specific portal feature mentioned was email .",
    "other features such as shopping , internet radio , games , and an online community were not mentioned .  as a result of these findings ,",
    "i include whether a portal is an individual s start page and whether that person has an email account at that site .",
    "i do not include other features or bookmarks .",
    "another important variable that the survey suggests should be included is the goal of search .",
    "most respondents claimed to use more than one search engine because `` different search engines are better suited to different tasks '' .",
    "links to relevant pages were also said to be important .",
    "i could derive data on whether a portal is linked to the next page visited .",
    "i did not include goal of search in the final analysis because including it did not satisfy the akaike information criterion or the bayesian information criterion for goodness of fit .",
    "whether a search fails is an important factor for an individual s experience with a data set .",
    "ideally each person would only conduct one task during each online session .",
    "therefore if the researcher observes the individual visit a search engine followed by a visit to a destination website without searching again , then it would be reasonable to assume the search was successful .  in this scenario ,",
    "if the researcher observes the individual search again after going to the site then the search would appear to have been a failure .",
    "more than 45% of the respondents claim to either perform several tasks or have no specific task in mind when they go online , considerably complicating the definition of a failed search .",
    "the group with no specific task in mind makes up only five percent of respondents ( 6% of spammed ) .  defining how they search and the reasons for it are beyond the scope of this survey .",
    "much more important is controlling for the more than forty percent of respondents ( also roughly 40% of spammed ) who do several tasks when they go online .  one way to do",
    "this is to compare the goals of searches that occur during a given session .",
    "if the goals are the same , it is more likely that they are part of the same search task .",
    "also , the elapsed time between searches may be relevant as would the number of sites seen between the visits to search engines .",
    "thus , if people search twice for the same thing in a short period of time , it seems reasonable to assume that the first search was a failure and the second a success .",
    "this relies on one further assumption : that people do not go to the destination site from the portal by typing in the name of the site .",
    "they only use links on the search page .",
    "they may type in a destination site , but not from the portal .",
    "only 5.8% of 155 searches ( 4.7% of 85 for spammed ) were followed by the use of a non - portal site that was not the final destination .",
    "this means that using the above method , over ninety - four percent of searches labelled as successful would in fact have been successful .",
    "while this is not perfect , it seems to be a reasonable measure .  also",
    ", if a person goes directly from one search engine to another then the visit to the first site is likely a failure .  using the above criteria , i constructed a variable for whether each search failed .",
    "the survey also showed that more experienced users search faster .",
    "this suggests that faster search is probably more desirable .",
    "furthermore , the survey suggests that habits are different at the second search engine visited during a given search than at the first .",
    "again , while the above information comes from a statistically biased sample , it does inform the researcher about analysis of clickstream data .",
    "i used the above information to construct several variables from the raw clickstream data .",
    "table 2 shows a sample of ten lines of raw data .  using only this information",
    ", i constructed the following variables : email , goal of search , start page , view length at the portal , links , search failure , whether a portal was the first visited in the search process , and guadagni & little s weighted loyalty variable .",
    "i will describe the derivation of each in turn .",
    "a household was considered to have an email account at a site if the household used the email feature at that site more than that at any other portal .",
    "i know that a household used email at a given site because the  host  in the data would reveal this .",
    "for example , ` com.yahoo.mail ' is yahoo s email provider and ` com.hotmail ' is msn s email provider .",
    "no household used more than one email account a large number of times , so i did not allow for households to have more than one portal as an email provider .",
    "many households did not use a portal email provider .",
    "this @xmath23 variable is potentially endogenous when individual heterogeneity is not taken into account because users will set up an email account at their favorite portal .  as such it can be used as a proxy for some individual heterogeneity .",
    "furthermore , if the goal is to predict future choices or to simulate changes , then this endogeneity is not relevant .",
    "it was the initial decision to use the email that was endogenous , once that account is set up , then each choice of portal is based on the existence of the email account .    as described in section 3.2 , knowing the goal of search is important for knowing whether a search fails .",
    "the goal of search was determined by the category of the site following a visit to a portal , if that next site was visited within five minutes of the end of the portal visit .",
    "if the goal of the search is another portal , then the goal of the first search is considered to be the same as the goal of the second .",
    "if no site is visited within five minutes of the end of a portal visit , then the search is considered to have no known goal .",
    "23.4% of all searches have no known goal .",
    "most of these occur because many people return to a portal page before logging off the internet .",
    "i do not consider these to be failed searches .",
    "the goals were divided into roughly one hundred overlapping categories including news , music , email , shopping for computers , automotive information and travel .",
    "a portal is considered to be a household s @xmath24 if at least 50% of all online sessions begin with that page .",
    "an online session is considered to end if a user does not do any activity for thirty minutes .  while imperfect , this method determines a starting page for almost all of the households .  like , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is potentially endogenous .",
    "people often change their start page to their favorite website .  again like @xmath25 @xmath26 this can proxy individual heterogeneity and the endogeneity is not relevant if the goal is to predict future choices or to simulate changes .",
    "28% of households have their start page at a portal .",
    "this is likely lower than the general population due to the lack of aol users .",
    "the view length spent at a portal is the time of departure minus the time of arrival ( in seconds ) .",
    "recall that it is time spent during _",
    "previous _ visits that is important for whether a household returns to that portal",
    ".    the number of pages viewed at a portal may reflect the depth of search .",
    "while individuals likely want to minimize time spent generally , search depth may be an important control factor .",
    "as with view length , it is number of pages viewed during previous visits that is important for whether a household returns to that portal .",
    "this study only reports results from a one period lag on @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "more complicated functions of past time spent and previous number of pages viewed do not yield qualitatively different results .",
    "links were determined by visiting each portal and recording which websites were directly linked to the main page .",
    "i recorded links in early april for each of the portals .  while it is possible that several of the links changed , there were no relevant changes in partnerships over that time .",
    "if the site that an individual visited following a portal visit was linked to a portal , the @xmath31 variable takes on a value of one .",
    "otherwise , it equals zero .",
    "note that the link variable can equal one even if the household did not visit that portal .",
    "for example , a household could search for financial information of yahoo , and the search may turn up information on msnmoneycentral .",
    "the @xmath31 variable serves as a proxy for portal features .  instead of listing whether a portal has features , this variable proxies whether people actually use these features .",
    "in other words , if people use a link , it means they are using a feature at that site , rather than the search capabilities .",
    "search failure was constructed largely as described in section 3.2 .",
    "if a household visited two portal sites in a row , and there was less than five minutes between visits , then the first search is considered a failure .",
    "furthermore , if the household conducts a search and then searches again for the same goal ( at the same site or at a different one ) within five minutes of the first search then the search is considered a failure .  while five minutes is an arbitrary number , extending it to ten minutes or shortening it to three minutes did not change the number of failures much .  as with time spent , it is whether previous searches at a site failed that matters .  also as with time spent , more complicated functions of past failure do not yield qualitatively different results .  for robustness",
    ", i also calculated a failed search variable that included searches that were not followed by other searches .",
    "if a portal was the first visited in the search process , then @xmath32 .",
    "if an individual has already searched and failed , then @xmath33 .",
    "this paper mimics guadagni and little s methodology for constructing their ` loyalty ' variable almost exactly .  in their paper",
    ", loyalty is considered to be a weighted average of past purchases of the brand , treated as dummy variables .",
    "let @xmath34 if household @xmath0 bought brand @xmath1 as its previous purchase and zero otherwise .",
    "@xmath35 rather than estimate @xmath36 by maximum likelihood which would significantly complicate the computational problem they calibrate @xmath36 based on dummies for lags of length one to ten .  in the present study , the value for alpha that minimizes the sum of the difference between the actual dummy coefficients and the loyalty function above was 0.7782",
    "i also use @xmath37 alone as a loyalty variable in the study .  note that this loyalty variable can be a result of either individual preferences for a given portal or from some kind of lock - in .  in future work",
    ", i plan to separate out these effects of heterogeneity and state dependence .  in a recent study , abramson , andrews , currim , and jones ( 2000 ) find this to be the best loyalty measure they tried .    in this study ,",
    "i define the @xmath38 variable to depend on the previous portal visited of any kind , not just the previous of the eight portals used in this study .",
    "therefore , if a household visits yahoo then about.com and then yahoo again , @xmath38 on the second visit to yahoo is equal to zero , even though only two observations are included in the data set .",
    "this means that a household is not considered brand loyal if it went to a rival portal s website , even if that rival portal is not in the sample .",
    "if i only included the sample , the coefficient on the loyalty variable increases slightly but its significance falls slightly .  note that the initial conditions problem frequently encountered in this literature does not apply here due to the large number of observations per household .",
    "how much time a household s previous visit to a portal took and whether that search failed are only observed when the household has visited that portal previously in the data set .  since",
    "not every household visits every portal , these variables are missing for a large number of observations .",
    "i therefore created a dummy variable for missing data .",
    "i also interact one minus the missing data variable with the view length of previous search and the failure of previous search variables .",
    "this overcomes the significant potential bias of assuming a value for the missing data or of ignoring it entirely .",
    "the missing data dummy has no economic interpretation .",
    "tables 3 and 4 contain descriptive statistics of the final data set .",
    "table 5 presents the main results of the paper .  model ( 1 ) presents the basic model .  here",
    ", the potentially endogenous variables of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 @xmath42 are not included .",
    "the variables all have the expected signs , although @xmath43 is barely significant : @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 mentions are all correlated with a higher probability of search .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath27 @xmath50 are all correlated with a lower probability of search .",
    "the positive sign on @xmath51 suggests that the effect of @xmath52 is concave .",
    "there was no expectation on the sign of @xmath53  the coefficient on advertising likely underestimates the actual effect of advertising as the data is aggregated over the month rather than actual advertising viewed by the user .",
    "model ( 2 ) adds @xmath39 and @xmath31 with the expected results .",
    "taking these into account makes @xmath43 significant .",
    "model ( 3 ) adds @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath60 @xmath57 is found to have an increasing and concave relationship with choice probability .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that pages viewed proxy depth of search .  in this regression ,",
    "@xmath27 @xmath61 is significant at the 99% confidence level .",
    "thus , controlling for depth , households prefer to spend less time at a portal .",
    "@xmath62 reveals that netscape and msn are preferred as first pages in a search than as later pages .",
    "this makes sense as they are the pages that appear when using the search function in the netscape navigator and microsoft internet explorer browsers .",
    "they are also often default  start pages , but the results do not change in models ( 4 ) through ( 6 ) which control for the start page .    model ( 4 ) adds the @xmath41 @xmath42 variable to model ( 2 ) .",
    "the coefficient on this variable is very large compared to the other dummy variables and the likelihood improves more for this variable than for any others ; however , the coefficient is not significantly different from zero as it has an extremely high standard error .",
    "model ( 5 ) is the same as model ( 4 ) except that is adds the interaction variable of media mentions and loyalty .  of particular interest here",
    "is the increase in the significance of @xmath63 .",
    "this suggests that being mentioned in the media has a larger effect for households that are less loyal to the brand .",
    "model ( 6 ) is the ` kitchen sink ' regression in that it includes all of the variables in the study .",
    "the coefficients and their significance are similar to models ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) .",
    "another interesting aspect of all of the models is that there is a clear brand preference for yahoo over the others .",
    "models ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) have negative coefficients for all brand dummies ( yahoo is the base ) .  models ( 4 ) through ( 6 ) also have negative dummies for yahoo but others are often preferred on the first try .  adding the coefficients together ,",
    "however , leaves a negative number meaning that yahoo is prefered even on the first try .",
    "the akaike information criterion revealed that @xmath51 , @xmath27 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath64 and @xmath46 @xmath65 should be included .",
    "other variables such as @xmath66 and @xmath67 did not satisfy the akaike information criterion . note that including @xmath68 increases the likelihood a great deal , even though the effect is statistically insignificant .",
    "any variables included in this study that satisfy the akaike information criterion also satisfy the bayesian information criterion .",
    "three different models are estimated in table 6 .",
    "the first is the same as model ( 2 ) except that it uses a broader definition of failed search .",
    "if no search is conducted after visiting a portal , then that is included in the failed search variable .  under the new definition of failed search , as under the old definition , the coefficient is significantly negative at the 99% confidence level ; however , the magnitude of the coefficient itself is smaller .",
    "furthermore , in this regression , @xmath43 is not significantly different from zero .",
    "the second and third models in table 6 mimic model ( 2 ) but change the loyalty variables .",
    "the second ( model ( 8) ) uses dummy variables for whether the portal is the same as that used the previous period and that used two periods before by that household .  the third ( model ( 9 ) ) uses only the one period lag .",
    "the coefficients are still significantly positive in all cases .",
    "note , however , that the explanatory power of these two methods is considerably less than that of guadagni and little s loyalty variable .  in both of these models ,",
    "the @xmath43 variable is not significantly different from zero .  in model ( 9 )",
    ", the coefficient becomes positive .",
    "if @xmath69 is included then @xmath43 does become significantly negative .",
    "table 7 shows the results of conducting the above analysis with any seven of the eight portals .",
    "note that , with a few exceptions , the coefficients change little .",
    "when either of the two largest advertisers are dropped ( aol or yahoo ) , advertising becomes insignificantly negative .",
    "when iwon , the site with the highest view length , is dropped , past view length becomes insignificantly positive .",
    "this is not because people are playing games at iwon , since games are considered a destination and not part of the portal page .",
    "although there is little change in the coefficients , the @xmath70 statistics at the bottom of table 7 show that the independence of irrelevant alternatives ( iia ) assumption does not hold in this model .",
    "iia implies that there is no correlation between the alternatives outside of the effects of known features .",
    "it is likely that netscape and msn are highly negatively correlated since they are based on different browsers .",
    "this method wrongly assumes that they are uncorrelated , bringing potential bias to some of the coefficients and weakening the assertions that can be made from policy analysis .",
    "it is essential that future work control for iia .",
    "these @xmath70 statistics were calculated using a hausman test following hausman and mcfadden ( 1984 ) .",
    "the coefficients on the brand dummies were neither included in the hausman test nor presented in table 7 although they were estimated for each model .  while the coefficients themselves change little when a portal is dropped out of the estimation , the large sample size and corresponding low variances of the coefficients lead to a rejection of iia .",
    "this is a considerable , though frequently encountered , problem  in this type of analysis .",
    "hausman and wise ( 1978 ) and , more recently , berry ( 1994 ) describe how accounting for heterogeneity alleviates this problem . this will be the subject of future work .",
    "guadagni and little ( 1983 p. 221 ) , however , argue that `` a more important test of the model will be its performance on a holdout sample of customers . ''",
    "this is conducted in the next section .",
    "these robustness checks suggest that the effects of @xmath71 and @xmath72 on probability of choice may not be significantly different from zero .",
    "the coefficient on @xmath73is also not significantly different from zero .",
    "@xmath74the effect of @xmath63 is robust , but the impact is still not large .",
    "the other variables are all very important , particularly loyalty .",
    "the cause of the importance of the loyalty variable , however , is unknown ; it could be due to either state dependence or unobserved household heterogeneity or both .",
    "this section explores out of sample predictive power .",
    "figure 1 shows the predicted and actual shares of msn over the fourteen weeks from december 27 1999 to march 31 2000 for an outside sample of roughly 600 households .",
    "the predictions are done using both model ( 1 ) and model ( 6 ) .  in this case , both models match the actual shares rather closely",
    ".  figures 2 through 8 show the predicted and actual shares for the other portals .",
    "the fits are far from perfect .",
    "both models under - predict yahoo s share , both over - predict aol , altavista , excite , iwon , and lycos , and both fit msn and netscape fairly well .  with the exception of iwon , model ( 6 ) fits better than model ( 1 ) .",
    "for each of the brands , however , both models matched the general trends in the actual shares .",
    "week - to - week changes in actual shares are captured by the predicted models .",
    "accounting for differences among households should help improve this predictive ability .",
    "preliminary work in accounting for household tastes has shown , for example , that some people have a substantial taste preference for iwon , while others have a substantial dislike .",
    "this bimodal distribution of tastes is averaged out in the model used here .",
    "thus , actual preferences for iwon are not well represented .",
    "the preliminary work suggests that the brands with a unimodal and narrow distribution of tastes across households are predicted better than are other firms in the model presented in this paper .    while not perfect , this model has significant predictive power and",
    "could be used to explore how policies in one market would work in another .",
    "tables 8 and 9 explore the market responses to variable changes in model ( 2 ) assuming no competitive response .",
    "table 8 presents the elasticity of the model to slight changes in the variables at the variable means .",
    "table 9 converts these elasticities to changes in number of site visits .",
    "this table assumes that there are a total of 76.5 million web users , nielsen / netratings estimate for the month of february , 2000 .",
    "while the elasticity numbers appear small , the increase in the number of site visits from a marginal increase in a variable can be quite large .",
    "taking the results at face value , if msn users searches failed just 1% less often , msn would get almost three million more site visits .  if each site visit is worth five cents ( about the revenue received from the five advertisements seen over typical two page views at a typical search engine ) , then it would be worth it for msn to implement this change as long as it cost less than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars .",
    "the advertising results are perhaps the most interesting .",
    "an increase in advertising by one dollar would bring six more visits to altavista but twenty - six more to yahoo .",
    "therefore , altavista should increase its advertising if each new site visit brings in seventeen cents of revenue and yahoo should increase its advertising if each new site visit brings in just four cents of revenue .",
    "caution should be used in interpreting these results because of the lack of iia and because the functional form of the error term is important to deriving these results .",
    "the results , however , do show what future studies using iia and fewer functional assumptions can achieve and they are informative about general trends .",
    "for example , while the numbers themselves may not be completely accurate , it is likely that an extra dollar of advertising by yahoo has a larger effect than an extra dollar of advertising by altavista .",
    "the current exercise should be viewed as an approximation that demonstrates potential marginal gains from the variables .",
    "another way to simulate policy changes by the firms is to change the underlying data and reestimate the market shares given the known coefficients .",
    "this method underestimates changes because it does not count dynamic effects .",
    "it does , however , provide a lower bound for the impact . again using model ( 2 )",
    ", i undertook this exercise for several variables .",
    "if msn advertised as much as aol , then msn would gain 13,857,734 more visits assuming 76.5 million users .",
    "if , on the other hand , iwon advertised as much as aol then it would only gain 2,857,924 visits .",
    "if lycos searches were successful as often as yahoo searches , lycos traffic would rise by 25,726,505 or four percent .",
    "if altavista had the same links as msn then it would get 98,948,093 more visitors or ten percent .",
    "again , the exact quantities of these predictions should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the general trends , however , are informative .",
    "this study has provided a preliminary look at estimating demand for advertising - supported internet websites based on clickstream data .",
    "the methodology provides a reasonable fit to the actual patterns in the data .",
    "it has reasonable predictive power and is informative about the potential impact of various policy changes .",
    "this methodology has several weaknesses .",
    "the first , and most important , is that it does not take into account individual heterogeneity .",
    "this leads to a rejection of the independence of irrelevant alternatives hypothesis as well as poor predictive ability for iwon and yahoo in particular .  in future work with the data",
    ", i will estimate a model that accounts for this heterogeneity .",
    "another weakness in this methodology is that it does not allow for the market to grow .",
    "it predicts changes in share of a given population .",
    "it therefore ignores the impact of new users in a rapidly growing market and the effect of promotion on market size .",
    "the assumption that new users will have similar tastes to the current ones has some supporting evidence in that fact that market leaders change little over time in advertising - based internet industries ( goldfarb 2000b ) , but this methodology is much better at exploring the demand of existing users rather than that of potential new users .    with respect policy implications ,",
    "the study provides a framework for understanding policy effects .",
    "the simulations in section 4.3 show the impact of potential policy changes on market shares .",
    "while they do not take into account supply side reactions or individual heterogeneity , they do give better estimates of policy effects than currently exist .",
    "more detailed policy analysis can also be explored in this framework .",
    "for example , a portal could simulate a link to a commonly used site , say americangreetings.com .",
    "it could then determine the effect of this link on market share .",
    "the actual increase in share resulting from this change would be no more than the simulated level .",
    "it may be less because it may be that people who go to a given portal are also the kind of people who like the links it has .",
    "thus the effects of the new link may be less than predicted .",
    "because it does not account for individual heterogeneity , this model does not provide an effective framework for examining the effects of major industry changes such as bankruptcies , nor does it provide a way to look at the welfare impact of improved technology .  in future work , i will match the heterogeneous demand model to a supply side model and estimate the effects of industry changes on demand and welfare .",
    "the main purpose of this study was to show that demand for free online services can be estimated using methodologies that are common in both the economics and the marketing literature .",
    "the coefficients on the variables in the study had the expected signs and the predictive ability of the model , though not perfect , captured the major trends .",
    "furthermore , informative simulations can be conducted about the effects on share of changing variable values .",
    "clickstream data will be an important tool in understanding online demand .",
    "this study has shown that the standard econometric methods that have previously been applied to grocery scanner data can successfully be applied to clickstream data .  by bringing more econometric sophistication to this analysis",
