    "study of atomic and molecular polarizabilities remains an important task in atomic physics . the atomic polarizability    @xmath9    depends on electric dipole matrix elements @xmath10 @xcite which also describe transition strengths , state lifetimes , van der waals interactions , and scattering cross - sections .",
    "here @xmath11 denotes an electric dipole operator , @xmath12 the level energy with quantum number @xmath13 , and @xmath14 its wave functions .",
    "accurate measurements of polarizability facilitate progress in sophisticated atomic structure calculations and the theory of heavy atoms which results in more precise predictions for other important atomic parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of polarizabilities become even more crucial in applications for modern optical atomic clocks .",
    "predictions of the `` magic '' wavelength in optical lattice clocks @xcite and accurate estimation of the blackbody radiation shift require precise knowledge of static and dynamic polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "measurement of static polarizabilities provides an important benchmark for calculations resulting in significant improvement of optical clock performance @xcite .",
    "no less important are polarizability measurements for the ground state hyperfine components of the alkali atoms used in microwave atomic clocks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for alkalis in the ground state",
    "the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction for the polarizability is about 0.1% @xcite while the measurement uncertainty is typically 0.5 - 1.0% ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest uncertainty is demonstrated by using laser cooled atoms and atomic interferometers providing high sensitivity to electric fields @xcite .",
    "ground state atoms are relatively easy to prepare in a particular hyperfine and magnetic quantum state while the natural decay does not pose any limitation for the experiment .",
    "on the other hand , relatively long - lived rydberg atoms are highly sensitive to electric fields @xcite which simplifies interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "polarizability measurements were performed in atomic vapor cells @xcite and on laser cooled atoms @xcite with relative uncertainties of 0.1 - 3% depending on the state .",
    "asymptotic theory of rydberg atoms is well understood and shows good agreement with experimental observations .",
    "however , atoms in intermediately excited states pose a challenge both for experiment and theory . they are typically short - lived and difficult to address , while the response to an electric field is small compared to the rydberg states . for example , the intermediate states in rb and cs ( @xmath15 ) were studied previously using atomic beams ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the cited reference",
    "a scalar polarizability was measured with a relative uncertainty of about 5% .",
    "calculations of these states are also less accurate since the sum ( [ eq0 ] ) contains terms of alternating signs cancelling each other while a numerical error accumulates .",
    "in this paper we report an accurate measurement of the static scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 levels in rb-87 using spectroscopy of laser cooled atoms in a dc electric field . to our knowledge , the polarizability of the 5d level in rb has not been measured to date .",
    "the 5d level in rb is used in metrology @xcite because the frequency of the 5s-5d transition is recommended by the international committee for weights and measures ( cipm ) for the practical realization of the definition of the meter @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the 5d level polarizability is essential for an accurate evaluation of systematic shifts .",
    "however , published calculations show considerable discrepancy .",
    "two approaches were implemented to calculate the polarizabilities of the 5d level in rb : the method of model potential @xcite and the regular second order perturbation theory with direct summation of matrix elements and integration over the continuous spectrum @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the transition probabilities were calculated by the program atom @xcite partly relying on an accurate experimental input .",
    "the calculated results @xcite and @xcite differ 30% in the scalar polarizability and more than 100% in its tensor component as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "although this discrepancy can be readily explained by the intrinsic uncertainty of the theoretical approach @xcite , an accurate experimental measurement of the polarizability components is highly desirable .",

    "optical pumping of atoms to a certain magnetic sublevel allowed us to measure the tensor polarizability component with an uncertainty of 4% .",
    "the measured values allow for distinction between the results of calculations and may facilitate further theoretical progress .",
    "if an atom is placed in an external electric field , it becomes polarized and its energy levels are shifted according to @xcite :    @xmath23    here @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the scalar and tensor polarizabilities , respectively , while for alkali atoms the parameter @xmath24 can be written as :    @xmath25[3q(q-1)-4f(f+1)j(j+1)]}{(2f+3)(2f+2)f(2f-1)j(2j-1)}\\,\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 . here",

    "this relation should be taken into account if multiple magnetic sublevels are populated and the corresponding spectral components are not well resolved .    in our case",
    "the ground state is the 5p@xmath2 level in rb and the excited state is the 5d level , which are coupled by 776 nm laser radiation .",
    "the experimental values for scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the 5p@xmath2 level are equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the atomic unit of the polarizability is the cube of the bohr radius @xmath46 , but in the experiment the units of @xmath47 are more practical .",

    "to measure the stark shift of the 5d level in rubidium we used two - stage laser excitation @xmath49 in an external dc electric field on the order of 1kv / cm .",
    "rb-87 atoms were laser cooled in a regular six - beam magneto - optical trap ( mot ) with an axial magnetic field gradient of up to 20g / cm .",

    "compared to ref.@xcite , the atomic cloud was formed in the center of a plane capacitor consisting of two metallic meshes , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the capacitor was placed inside a vacuum glass cell ( 3@xmath523@xmath5212 cm ) providing easy optical access .",
    "[ t ! ]    the mesh consists of non - magnetic stainless steel wires with a diameter of 25@xmath50 m and has an optical transparency of 80% . to manufacture one of the capacitor plates the mesh was made taut and then glued to a flat glass plate with a hole of 1 cm in diameter .",
    "we saw to it that glue did not penetrate through the mesh to the front surface .",
    "two plates were glued together using four glass posts of calibrated length , thus forming a plane capacitor with rectangular plates of @xmath53 cm and the separation of 1 cm .",
    "the distance between the plates and the hole size provides clearance for the laser cooling beams .",
    "one pair of laser cooling beams were sent through the mesh as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , which did not significantly change the cloud shape or the number of atoms .",
    "although all glass components were manufactured in the laboratory of optics , p.n .",
    "lebedev physics institute , and have superior flatness and well - defined sizes within a few @xmath50 m , the glue can influence the distance @xmath54 between the meshes . to reach an uncertainty of 0.5% in polarizability one should know the electric field to 0.2% , which corresponds to 20@xmath50 m uncertainty in the distance .",
    "the parallelism of the glass plates was checked in the air using a micrometer and found to be parallel to within @xmath55 .",
    "this angle was taken into account in calculations of the electric field .",
    "the distance @xmath54 between the meshes was measured optically in vacuum using a high na lens assembly ( @xmath56 ) which imaged a free standing mesh on a ccd camera .",
    "the lens and the camera were rigidly placed on a three - coordinate translation stage outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "the translation stage axis was aligned with @xmath57 accuracy perpendicular to the capacitor plate ( along the @xmath58-axis , fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the focus position for one of the meshes was determined from a number of shots using a gradient filter method and then by fitting the position of the translation stage to the highest image sharpness .",
    "this method provides a statistical uncertainty of 5@xmath50 m . moving the translation stage in the @xmath59-@xmath60 direction we performed similar measurements in the region within @xmath613 mm of the hole center .",
    "the distance remained constant within 20@xmath50 m , the scatter can be explained by the mesh thickness . the final result including the averaged mesh thickness gives @xmath62",
    ". the refractive index of air contributes to the result on a negligible level .",
    "the field distribution in our capacitor was simulated using a finite element analysis , the result for the @xmath59-@xmath60 plane as well as the zoom in of the central volume is shown in fig.[fig2](a ) .",
    "the position of the atomic cloud was controlled within @xmath63 mm with respect to the center of the capacitor by two ccd cameras . as follows from fig.[fig2 ] , the field variation within this volume is less than 0.05% .",
    "the potential difference between the plates could be varied from zero to 2.5kv using a high - voltage power supply ( stanford research systems ps350 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the device was studied with a high - precision voltmeter and corresponded to 0.1% variation .",
    "measurement of the stark shift of each of the @xmath64 transitions ( fig.[fig3 ] ) was performed in a pulsed regime , the pulse sequence was repeated every 20@xmath50s and is depicted in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "first , atoms were laser cooled using the 780 nm transition coupling @xmath65 and @xmath66 levels . since the mot is formed close to the zero of the quadrupole magnetic field , all magnetic sublevels of the @xmath66 level become nearly equally populated , which does not allow for determination of polarizabilities ( [ eq1 ] ) , so we prepare the atoms into a particular magnetic state using optical pumping at 780 nm .    after switching off the mot",
    "beams we waited for 200ns and applied a circularly @xmath67 polarized pump pulse along the @xmath58-axis ( fig.[fig1 ] ) to transfer atoms to the @xmath68 magnetic state , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the pulse had an intensity of 100 mw/@xmath69 and a duration of 500ns , which is much longer than the reverse pumping rate .",
    "experimental results presented in the next section verify that nearly all atoms addressed by the probe 5p@xmath705d radiation were pumped into the @xmath71 sublevel .",
    "the probe beam at 776 nm was tuned close to resonance with one of the fine structure sublevels 5d@xmath72 , which are separated by 89ghz .",
    "the probe beam was directed at an angle of 11@xmath73 to the @xmath58-axis , allowing for independent control of its polarization .",
    "polarization of the probe beam was changed from @xmath67 to @xmath74 with respect to its wave vector @xmath75 . in this case",
    "we can address different magnetic sublevels of the 5d multiplet and thus derive polarizabilities using ( [ eq1 ] ) . due to the set angle to the quantization axis , probe radiation always contains an admixture of linear polarized light ( with respect to the @xmath58-axis ) , which is taken into account in our analysis .",
    "thus , with the pump beam we couple the sublevel @xmath68 either with one of the sublevels from @xmath76 multiplet or with one from the @xmath77 as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the 5d level is about 100mhz and is well resolvable .",
    "the probe pulse with an intensity of 100 mw/@xmath69 was switched on right after the pump beam was switched off . the time delay between the two pulses",
    "was chosen to be 10ns to avoid overlap between pulses .",
    "the strong pump beam causes an ac stark shift of the 5p@xmath2 level , which influences the results of our measurement .",
    "the 5p@xmath2 level lifetime equals 30ns and most of the atoms excited to the 5p@xmath2 remain there when the probe beam is on .",
    "the probe pulse duration was 50ns , which is much shorter than the 5d level lifetime ( 300ns ) .",
    "this prevents optical pumping back to the 5p@xmath2 level and re - distribution of the population between magnetic components .",
    "approximately 30% of atoms in the 5d state decay to the ground state _ via _ the 6p level , emitting 410 nm photons . in our experiment ,",
    "`` blue '' photons were collected onto a photomultiplier tube equipped with a narrow - band 410 nm filter .",
    "photons were counted in a time window of 1 @xmath50s , as shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the probe laser was scanned over the resonance with an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) .",
    "for each of the frequency steps ( typically 50 per line ) the signal was accumulated for 0.1s .",
    "a typical count rate at the resonance position was @xmath78cps .",
    "the mot magnetic field gradient was continuously switched on .",
    "the influence of magnetic field on our results is discussed below .",
    "measurement of the stark shift for each of the lines @xmath64 was performed at different voltages on the capacitor plates .",
    "for each of the selected voltages three spectral lines were recorded , namely , with positive voltage polarity , grounded electrodes and negative polarity , to prevent any influence of charging .",
    "the zero - voltage data was also used in the data analysis .",
    "typical spectra of @xmath79 and @xmath80 transitions at different electric field strengths and probe beam polarizations are shown in figs.[fig5],[fig6 ] , respectively . from these spectra",
    "we derive the frequency shifts of the corresponding transitions , estimate the quality of initial state preparation and estimate the excitation probabilities to different magnetic sublevels of the 5d level .",
    "the spectra were fitted by three different models :  ( a ) sum of two gaussian functions , ( b ) sum of two lorentzian functions and ( c ) sum of two lorentzian functions convoluted with the probe pulse spectral profile .",
    "the pulse shape was measured in @xcite and its fourier spectrum width equals 20 mhz for 50ns duration .",
    "the model used 6 fit parameters : two amplitudes , two central frequencies and two widths .",
    "the different fit functions were used to test the model dependency of our fitting procedure and to evaluate the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the fit gave us the frequency of each of the hyperfine components at different values of the electric field .",
    "to derive the polarizability of the @xmath17 level we used transitions from the @xmath81 level to two different hyperfine sublevels excited at different polarizations of the probe beam : @xmath82 ( fig.[fig5 ] , top ) and @xmath83 ( fig.[fig5 ] , bottom ) .",
    "for the @xmath16 level we use , respectively , @xmath84 ( fig.[fig6 ] , top ) and @xmath85 ( fig.[fig6 ] , bottom ) .",
    "since the probe beam radiation always contains a fraction of linearly polarized light if projected on the @xmath58-axis ( tilted by 11@xmath73 with respect to @xmath75 ) , all mentioned hyperfine components ( except @xmath84 ) contain two different magnetic sublevels , as follows from fig.[fig3 ] . after projecting on the @xmath58-axis ,",
    "the circularly polarized pump beam will consist of 96% circular polarization ( the same sign ) and 4% linear polarization .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] shows an example of the data for the @xmath82 and @xmath83 hyperfine sublelevs obtained at different electric field strengths .",

    "switching off the magnetic field in the experiment takes about 500@xmath50s , which would drastically reduce the duty cycle and the count rate .",
    "therefore we decided to take the magnetic field into account instead of switching it off .",
    "the influence of the magnetic field can be considered as additional degradation of the efficiency of the optical pumping .",
    "we found that magnetic field reduces relative population of the @xmath94 level in our experiment from 98% to 97% .",
    "more information about optical pumping in the magnetic field can be found in appendix i.    to verify that the field does not significantly influence the results of our measurements , we measured the dependencies similar to that shown in fig.[fig7 ] at axial magnetic field gradients of 10g / cm and 5g / cm .",
    "we did not observe any significant difference within the statistical uncertainty . since",
    "our regular measurements were performed at a gradient of 10g / cm , we conservatively add a systematic uncertainty to the @xmath87 values ( [ eq7 ] ) of 0.1% due to the influence of the magnetic field .    the different fitting procedures ( a , b , c ) described above influence the results at the level of 0.03% , so we add this value to the uncertainty of coefficients @xmath87 coming from the line shape model .",
    "calculation shows that the residual population of the 5p@xmath95 level ( see table[table2 ] ) can influence the coefficients @xmath87 on the level of 0.07% .",
