    "we prepared samples using two different technologies based on aluminium and niobium .",
    "all samples were fabricated on a thermally oxidized si substrates .",
    "the al - alo@xmath0-al junctions were prepared with the shadow evaporation technique .",
    "this method for the preparation of sub-@xmath1 m al - alo@xmath0-al tunnel junctions is well known ( see , e.g. ref .  ) .",

    "thus , for long junctions ( several hundred micrometers ) the bridge can not be well fixed .",
    "therefore , in our preparation method , we use a _ `` shadowing window''_. schematically the fabrication steps are shown in fig .",

    "the first step was the formation of au electrodes , used for spatially - uniform bias current injection and voltage measurement leads ( fig .",

    "the ( nonrelativistic ) mass @xmath209 of a josephson vortex , which appears in the equation of motion @xmath210 for the vortex center of mass coordinate @xmath211 in an external potential @xmath212 , is obtained by expanding the lagrange function @xmath213 of eq .",

    "the external potential @xmath212 for a vortex in a josephson junctions can be , for example , induced by an external magnetic field or by presence of a micro - short ( micro - resistor ) . in the first case , the external magnetic field creates a screening current flowing through the junction .",
    "provided that the nonlocality of the magnetic screening at the edges can be neglected or , equivalently , eq .  ( [ boundcond ] ) for the boundary condition is justified , the current spreads homogenously over the width of the junction .",
    "hence , the external potential @xmath219 is proportional to the junction width @xcite . in the second case",
    ", the inhomogeneity leads to a local change in the josephson energy .",
    "if the magnitude of the inhomogeneity is constant across the junction , the total change in the josephson energy is proportional to @xmath6 . as we see , in both situations the external potential @xmath212 scales with @xmath6 , hence , for characterizing the degree of quantum behavior , the use of the _ specific _ mass @xmath220 for a vortex is more appropriate than using the mass @xmath209 .    for local theory ( @xmath221 ) , the mass of a vortex of form ( [ expkink ] ) is given by @xmath222 which vanishes in the limit @xmath223 , whereas the specific mass @xmath224 is constant .",
    "similarly , in the nonlocal case we make use of the ansatz @xmath225 , where @xmath226 and @xmath227 is the characteristic length scale of the vortex , which in general depends on the velocity ( cf .",
    "the lorentz - factor @xmath228 in the local case ) , and which can be determined from the variational ansatz . as the lorentz invariance is broken in the nonlocal case",
    ", we do not know a priori the functional dependence of @xmath229 on @xmath230 , and an additional explicit dependence on @xmath230 is possible , if the shape of the vortex depends on @xmath230 . from ( [ lagrange ] )",

    "then the expression in brackets is the lagrange equation for the variation parameter @xmath235 , and is therefore equal to zero .",
    "thus the effective mass for the trial function of the form ( [ expkink ] ) can explicitly be written as @xmath236    since @xmath69 increases with @xmath6 , both the effective mass @xmath237 and the specific mass @xmath238 ( responsible for the energy scaling , if @xmath239 ) decrease with decreasing the junction width . from eq .",
    "( [ specificmass ] ) one notes that the inverse of the specific mass scales with the characteristic length @xmath240 ( see figs .  [ lengthal ] and [ length ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize again that the possibility of a vortex behaving as a macroscopic quantum particle , when reducing the width @xmath6 of the junction , not only depends on the scaling of the ( kinetic ) mass @xmath209 , but more exactly the ratio of the kinetic energy to the external potential @xmath212 , which has to be determined for each specific experimental situation .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics and critical current versus field patterns of narrow long josephson junctions show a strong dependence on the junction width @xmath6 .",
    "this can not be explained using the conventional theory based on the local sine - gordon model .",
    "our experimental data are well described by the nonlocal theory originally developed by ivanchenko @xcite , and later extended by lomtev and kuzovlev @xcite . according to these models , the electrodynamic and static properties of a junction",
    "depend on the junction width .",
    "our experimental data for fiske steps observed in both al - alo@xmath0-al and nb - alo@xmath0-nb long narrow junctions are in very good quantitative agreement with these theories .",
    "the dependence of the first critical field on the width of the junction allows qualitative estimates of the characteristic vortex size , which is influenced by nonlocal effects .",
    "a proper description of the static effects requires a better treatment of the boundary conditions at the edges of a junction .",
    "we also calculate the specific mass of a vortex in the nonlocal case . according to local theory ,",
    "the specific mass does not depend on the junction width @xmath6 .",
    "by contrast , the nonlocal theory predicts that the specific mass of a vortex decreases with decreasing junction width .",
