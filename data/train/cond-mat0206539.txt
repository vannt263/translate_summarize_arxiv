    "ladder systems have been studied intensively over the years as a simplified model system that shows variety of quantum phenomena due to strong electron correlations.@xcite since the ladder models can be analyzed with powerful nonperturbative methods such as bosonization and conformal field theory as well as with large - scale numerical calculations , they provide a useful testing ground of various theoretical ideas developed for the two - dimensional case .",
    "moreover , the studies of ladder systems have been strongly stimulated by experimental developments in synthesizing compounds with ladder structure that show superconductivity and spin - liquid behavior.@xcite a good example is the ladder compound sr@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 that shows @xmath2-wave superconducting order@xcite under pressure with ca doping and charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order as recently suggested experimentally.@xcite theoretical studies on doped ladder models such as the hubbard and @xmath8-@xmath9 ladders have established that the dominant correlation is indeed a @xmath2-wave - like superconducting order , a feature that is reminiscent of the @xmath2-wave superconductivity in high-@xmath10 cuprates . on the other hand , undoped half - filled hubbard and heisenberg ladders are insulators that have a gap in both charge and spin excitations .",
    "this spin - liquid behavior is caused by singlet formation on each rung , and the state is said to be in the rung - singlet phase .",
    "it is also named d - mott phase@xcite because of its close connection to the @xmath2-wave - like paring state .",
    "recent theoretical interest on the ladder models has been focused on the search of exotic phases in these systems . in particular , the staggered - flux ( sf ) state,@xcite which is also known as the orbital antiferromagnet@xcite and the @xmath2-density wave,@xcite has received a lot of attention . for more than a decade",
    "the sf state has been intensively studied in connection with the pseudo - gap phase in the two - dimensional high-@xmath10 cuprates .",
    "the sf state has spontaneous currents flowing around plaquettes , breaking the time - reversal symmetry . even though ladders are one - dimensional ( 1d ) , the long - range order of the sf correlation is possible at half - filling , since the symmetry broken in this state is discrete .",
    "this point was emphasized recently in ref .  , where it is also suggested that the sf phase should occur in the phase diagram of the so(5 )",
    "symmetric hubbard model.@xcite besides the sf phase , the ground - state phase diagram of the ladder models can include the d - mott phase mentioned above , the cdw phase,@xcite and other phases .",
    "motivated by these developments , in this paper we attempt systematic exploration of the ground - state phase diagram of a generalized two - leg hubbard ladder at half - filling that has not only repulsive on - site and inter - site interactions but also antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange interaction and pair hoppings between the legs . to map out the possible phases in the parameter space of the model and to analyze various quantum phase transitions , we employ both the strong - coupling perturbation theory and the weak - coupling bosonization method .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the additional interactions leads to emergence of various new phases .    in the strong - coupling approach",
    ", we describe the sf state as an af ordered state of pseudo - spins that represent currents flowing on the rungs .",
    "the effective theory near the phase boundary between the sf state and the d - mott state is then found to be the 1d ising model in a transverse field . the d - mott phase is thus interpreted as a disordered state of the ising model .",
    "we also present a similar mapping to the 1d quantum ising model for the quantum phase transition between the cdw phase and the s - mott phase.@xcite here the cdw state and the s - mott state correspond to the ordered and quantum disordered states of the ising model , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we show that a low - energy effective theory near the phase transition between the d - mott and the s - mott phases is the xxz spin chain in a staggered field , which exhibits a u(1 ) gaussian criticality .    in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "we follow the standard approach of taking continuum limit and bosonizing the hamiltonian .",
    "we obtain a coupled sine - gordon model for four bosonic modes ( charge / spin & even / odd modes ) and analyze it by perturbative renormalization - group ( rg ) method and a semiclassical approximation .",
    "the scaling equations we derive are equivalent to those obtained earlier by lin , balents , and fisher.@xcite we depart here from the earlier work .",
    "we consider four types of density - wave states with different angular momentum:@xcite @xmath0-density wave (= cdw ) , @xmath1-density wave ( pdw , which is equivalent to the spin - peierls state ) , @xmath2-density wave (= sf ) , and @xmath3-density wave ( fdw ) .",
    "these density - wave states break z@xmath4 symmetry and can have long - range order at zero temperature .",
    "we find that in general there should appear four types of mott insulating phases ( called s - mott , d - mott , s-mott , and d-mott states ) , each of which can be obtained as a quantum disordered state from one of the four z@xmath4-symmetry - breaking density - wave states .",
    "we then study quantum phase transitions among these 8 phases and show that a transition between a density - wave state and a mott state is either second order ( in the ising or su(2)@xmath4 universality class ) or first order.@xcite phase transitions between density - wave states and between mott states are u(1 ) gaussian criticalities . after classifying the phases and the quantum phase transitions , we determine the ground - state phase diagram of the extended hubbard model with extra inter - site repulsion and the exchange interaction .",
    "we find that the s - mott and the sf phases appear in the parameter space of couplings where the d - mott and the cdw phases compete .",
    "we also show that the next - nearest - neighbor repulsion stabilizes the s-mott state and the pdw state ; the latter state is connected to the d - mott state through the su(2)@xmath4 criticality .",

    "we have shown that the sf state can appear next to the cdw state and the d - mott state in the phase diagram and that the quantum phase transition between the sf state and the d - mott state is in the ising universality class .",
