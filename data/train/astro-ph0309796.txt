    "the evolution of the sn rate over cosmic time is a key ingredient for understanding the chemical enrichment history of the universe and the formation and properties of galaxies and clusters . since the progenitors of core - collapse sne are massive , short - lived stars , their cosmic rate evolution will closely follow the universal star formation history ( sfh ) . on the other hand , the actual route that leads a white dwarf ( wd ) to explode as a sn",
    "ia is still an open question ( see , e.g. , yungelson & livio 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "the mechanism that leads to the explosions of sne  ia likely involves a significant delay between the formation of the progenitor system and the explosion of the sn .",
    "the rate of sne  ia at a given epoch is therefore expected to depend on the star formation rate up to several gyr preceding that epoch .",
    "thus , the cosmic evolution of sn rates can be used to constrain both the global sfh , and the characteristic delay time between star formation and sn  ia explosion ( e.g. , madau , della valle & panagia 1998 ; hereafter mdp ) .",
    "since competing sn  ia models predict different delay times , observational constraints on the delay can discriminate between some of the proposed scenarios for sn  ia progenitor systems .    during the last few years , sne  ia",
    "have been used successfully as cosmological distance indicators ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998,2001 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; tonry et al .",
    "perhaps the main uncertainty that still plagues sn - ia - based distance measurements is the possibility of evolution in sn  ia properties .",
    "the use of sne  ia as distance estimators relies on the assumption that distant sne  ia at redshifts as high as @xmath10 are similar to local events . in order to study this question from a theoretical perspective , we require knowledge on the nature of the progenitor systems of sne  ia . for any given scenario , it is possible to estimate the evolution of high-@xmath7 systems relative to local ones , e.g. , as a result of metallicity or stellar - age effects .",
    "determination of sn  ia delay times , with the resulting constraints on progenitor models , are therefore desirable .    motivated by these questions ,",
    "a number of authors have recently studied the evolution of sn rates .",
    "most studies have combined models of the sfh with a recipe for the delay function of sne  ia , and have calculated the expected evolution of sn rates , either per unit comoving volume , or per unit stellar luminosity ( e.g. j@xmath11rgensen et al .",

    "2000 ; gal - yam , maoz , & sharon 2002 ; tonry et al .",
    "2003 ) are based on sne  ia in the redshift range @xmath13 . due to the limited number of observed sne  ia ,",
    "these studies have distributed their samples into wide redshift bins . in gal - yam",
    "( 2002 ) we divided our sample into two redshift bins , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this binning caused no loss of information in our work , as the number of bins was comparable to the number of sne ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "on the other hand , pain et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 2002 ) and tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used only one bin , and calculated the sn rate at an average redshift , @xmath17 . in these cases ,",
    "most of the redshift information is lost in the binning process .",
    "this loss may be averted if , instead of deriving absolute rates from the observations , and comparing them to predicted rates , we begin with the predictions and fold them through the observational filters .",
    "we can then compare the prediction for a particular experiment with the unbinned observations . specifically",
    ", we can test whether or not the unbinned distribution of sn redshifts in a particular survey is consistent with some model .",
    "indeed , several authors have calculated such distributions ( e.g. , dahln & fransson 1999 , hereafter df ; sullivan et al . 2000a ) .",
    "df noted that these distributions can be used to constrain progenitor models .",
    "however , they concentrated on future , deep surveys with the _ james webb space telescope _ , and did not attempt to constrain model parameters using existing sn data .",

    "2003 ) , or to vary as some power of the redshift ( pain et al .",
    "the comparison between the expected and observed sn  ia redshift distributions is used to find the best fitting rate evolution , and to derive the average sn  ia rate at the mean redshift ( @xmath20 in both cases ) .",
    "again , the information contained in the redshift distribution of sne  ia at @xmath21 is lost in the averaging process .",
    "both groups note that their data seem to indicate a slowly varying sn  ia rate in this redshift range .",
    "tonry et al .",
    "conclude that , given that the slope of the sn  ia rate is shallower than that of some determinations of the sfh in this redshift range , the typical delay time between star formation and sn  ia explosion must be @xmath22 gyr .    in view of the fact that some models ( e.g. , mdp ) predict strong evolution in the sn  ia rate at @xmath21 , in contrast with the trends seen by pain et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , we have undertaken a more comprehensive investigation of the sn  ia redshift distribution in this range . as we will show below",
    ", existing data can already place interesting limits on the sfh and on the sn  ia characteristic delay time .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we designate with @xmath25 the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 .",
    "we begin by calculating @xmath27 , the redshift distribution of sne visible in a region of sky at a given moment , to a limiting @xmath28-band magnitude @xmath29 . throughout this paper , we assume that all apparent magnitudes are measured in the @xmath28-band . our calculations can be applied to any other band , as long as all apparent magnitudes are measured in the same band .",
    "then , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sn rate density , defined as the number of sne per unit time per unit volume as a function of the redshift , and @xmath32 is the volume between @xmath7 and @xmath33 in that region of sky . @xmath34 is the effective visibility time of a sn at redshift @xmath7 , given the detection efficiency as a function of magnitude ( this is often referred to as the `` control time '' ) .",
    "@xmath35 depends on @xmath7 because sne at higher @xmath7 are fainter , and therefore can be detected for a shorter period above the limiting magnitude @xmath29 .",
    "the brightness of the sn in the chosen bandpass also depends on @xmath7 since different parts of the sn spectrum are redshifted into the observed band for sne at different redshifts .",
    "the detailed form of the sfh , @xmath51 , is a much debated issue in recent years .",

    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 , madau , pozzetti , & dickinson , 1998 ) suggested that the sfh increases sharply between redshifts of zero and @xmath52 , and then decreases at higher @xmath7 .",
    "however , this picture has been challenged .",
    "for instance , steidel et al . ( 1999 ) argue for an almost - constant sfh at @xmath53 , while lanzetta et .",
    "2002 ) favor a monotonic increase in sfh out to @xmath54 . at lower redshifts , cowie , songaila , & barger ( 1999 ) and sullivan et al .",

    "( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "note that no k - corrections are needed , as the input we require are the peak @xmath28 magnitudes at all redshifts , and these do not have to be translated into rest frame @xmath90 magnitudes , as done by the scp for hubble - diagram purposes . in terms of the light curves , @xmath87 ,",
    "the observer - frame @xmath28 band is a fair match for rest - frame @xmath90 band in most of the redshift range we model .",
    "however , at the highest and lowest redshifts , rest - frame @xmath91 and @xmath92 wavelengths , respectively , dominate the observer - frame @xmath28 band . since the light curves of sne  ia have slightly different forms in each band , we have constructed a set of @xmath7-dependent observer - frame light curves , by linearly interpolating between the appropriate rest - frame light curves .",
    "the template light curves were adapted from @xmath91 , @xmath90 and @xmath92 light curves , kindly supplied by b. leibundgut , and supplemented with data points taken from riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which also give slightly better coverage of the pre - maximum period .",
    "early @xmath91-band observations of sne ia are scarce , so we had to extrapolate the rest - frame @xmath91-band light curve . however , this extrapolated curve is only relevant for high-@xmath7 sne , which are invariably discovered close to the limiting magnitude .",
    "therefore , the influence of the extrapolated part of the light curve , well below the peak magnitude , is negligible .",
    "the @xmath88 curve and observer frame @xmath28-band light curves represent the properties of an average sn  ia .    in reality , the peak magnitudes and light curve shapes are not uniform .",
    "`` peculiar '' sne  ia are quite common in low-@xmath7 sn samples , but they are apparently absent from high-@xmath7 samples like the ones we consider ( li et al . 2001 ) .",
    "one may worry that many sne  ia of the `` underluminous '' , 1991bg - like , variety are missed at high  @xmath7 due to their lower luminosity , and we return to consider this possibility in section @xmath39 .",
    "even spectroscopically `` normal '' sne  ia are not perfect standard candles , and exhibit an intrinsic scatter of @xmath93 mag in peak luminosity ( see branch 1998 , for a review ) .",
    "the peak magnitude of a sn  ia is correlated with the light - curve shape of the object , with brighter events having a slower rise to maximum followed by a slower decline ( e.g. , phillips 1993 ; phillips et al .",
    "1999 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "a correction factor can be applied to the peak magnitude to calibrate sne  ia as standard candles .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in peak magnitudes and the differences in light curve shapes may cause a scatter in the visibility times of sne , since brighter and broader sne will have longer visibility times .",
    "perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) show the distribution of correction factors ( their fig .",
    "4 ) . in order to account for this distribution",
    ", we have calculated the effective visibility times for sne with various peak magnitudes and light - curve shapes .",
    "we then average these times using the distribution of peak magnitudes given by perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as a weighting function .",
    "we thus obtain a function @xmath74 that fits a population of sne  ia with properties similar to those observed by the scp .",
    "having determined @xmath74 for a particular survey , we can calculate the redshift distribution of sne  ia , @xmath84 , as a function of the model parameters .",
    "figure 1d illustrates @xmath84 for the two examples of @xmath31 in figure 1c .",
    "we then convert these redshift distributions to cumulative form , and use the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic to test if a data set is consistent with the predictions of a specific model .",
    "figure 1 ( panels e - f ) shows an example of this procedure .",
    "bloom ( 2003 ) presents a similar treatment of the redshift distribution of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we now choose a sample of sne  ia whose redshift distribution can be compared with predictions . over the last few years , hundreds of high-@xmath7 sne  ia have been discovered , mainly by the scp ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 ) and the high-@xmath7 supernova search team ( schmidt et al .",
    "these sne were discovered during numerous observing runs , using different telescopes and detectors , through various pass - bands and under non - uniform conditions .",
    "given a complete description of the observations , a combined analysis of all available data sets should be feasible . at present , we limit ourselves to an analysis of a single data set obtained with a uniform observational setup , and for which most of the observational details are available , in particular estimates of the survey efficiency @xmath77 .    the scp have published the results of their efficiency studies for several sn samples ( pain et al . 2002 ) . here , we study the deepest and largest of these data sets . this sn sample is denoted as set `` d '' in the analysis of pain et al .",
    "following is a brief outline of the search procedure used to discover these sne .",
    "deep ( 3600 s , total ) @xmath28-band exposures were obtained with the btc camera mounted on the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio , on december 28 - 29 , 1997 .",
    "these were compared with similar images obtained 36 - 37 days earlier .",
    "seventeen candidate sne were discovered , with discovery magnitudes @xmath94 and redshifts @xmath95 .",
    "twelve sne were spectroscopically confirmed as sne  ia .",
    "however , only eleven of these were retained in the `` statistical sample '' used by pain et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to calculate sn rates , and these constitute the sample we analyze , presented in table 1 .",
    ".the scp sn sample [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sn sample was discovered in 11 different fields ( pain et al . 2002 ) observed under non - uniform atmospheric conditions , leading to survey efficiency curves @xmath96 which vary from field to field .",
    "we have averaged the efficiency curves measured for each field ( kindly provided by r. pain ) , to get the mean efficiency of the survey , @xmath97 ( figure 2 ) . since the efficiency enters our calculations in a linear fashion , calculating the sn redshift distribution using the mean curve is equivalent to performing the calculation for each field individually ( with the appropriate efficiency curve ) and summing the results .",
    "we neglect a possible redshift dependence of the efficiency due to the variation in the contrast between sn light and underlying host galaxy emission within a constant aperture .",
    "this contrast is reduced with redshift @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the luminosity distance . for our chosen cosmology ,",
    "this gives a factor of @xmath100 between @xmath101 and @xmath6 .",
    "galaxy and sn k - corrections will offset some of this effect , and , from fig .",
    "2b of pain et al . (",
    "2002 ) we can estimate that the remaining correction to the sn detection efficiency will be of a few per cent at most .",
    "the search strategy employed by the observers in a certain survey can also influence the predicted redshift distribution of sne  ia .",
    "in particular , the scp survey whose data we use here requires that a candidate sn be brighter in a search image than in a reference image taken a few weeks earlier .",
    "this criterion was designed to discover only sne near peak magnitude , and is driven by the scp s scientific goals ( perlmutter 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the search criterion has implications for the calculation of the effective visibility times @xmath89 .",
    "for example , low-@xmath7 sne , that are much brighter than the survey s limiting magnitude @xmath29 , could , in principle , contribute significantly to @xmath35 ( eq . 8) .",
    "however , during most of the time these objects spend above @xmath29 , they are declining in magnitude , and therefore would have been ignored by the scp .",
    "we therefore limit the calculation of @xmath89 to the period during which a sn is brighter in the second epoch image than it was 36 days before , when the reference images were obtained .",
    "this is achieved by multiplying the integrand in eq .",
    "we have calculated the expected redshift distribution of sne  ia for the above survey , for a range of characteristic delay times @xmath103 gyr , and sfh indices @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "examination of the full range of models calculated shows that the data can not constrain the model parameters individually , i.e. , the characteristic delay time is degenerate with the sfh functional form .",
    "however , if we assume some prior , either on the time delay @xmath1 or on the sfh , the data can be used to constrain the other parameters .",
    "for instance , figure 3 shows the range of allowed values for @xmath1 assuming some of the sfh functions appearing in the recent literature .",
    "we can see that if the madau et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sfh is assumed , the delay time @xmath1 is constrained to be @xmath106 gyr at the @xmath3 confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "rising sfhs , similar to those advocated by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , are ruled out at the @xmath4 cl , unless @xmath107 gyr",
    ". a gentler evolution of the sfh , e.g , as proposed by cowie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , places no constraints on @xmath1 . inspecting the actual distributions predicted by the various models ( e.g. , fig .",
    "1e and 1f ) , we find that invariably , the models that are ruled out by the data under - predict the number of sne  ia at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath20 ) relative to the number of sne  ia at higher redshifts ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the constraints set on the sfh for given values of the delay time @xmath1 .",
    "the first two panels show that , for short delay times ( @xmath109 gyr ) , the data constrain only the low-@xmath7 index @xmath67 .",
    "for such short delays , the sfh at high@xmath12 does not strongly affect ( and is therefore not constrained by ) the sn redshift distribution we measure at @xmath110 .",
    "if we assume such short time delays , the sn data require a gentle decline in sfh from @xmath6 to @xmath18 ( @xmath111 ) , favoring the results of cowie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sullivan et al .",
    "( 2000a ) over those of lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) or the recent findings of hippelein et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "as we consider longer time delays ( @xmath112 gyr ) , the data begin to constrain also the high-@xmath7 evolution of the sfh , parameterised by the index @xmath64 . generally speaking ,",
    "sfhs that decline above @xmath61 ( e.g. , madau et al . 1998 ) are favored over the strongly rising functions of lanzetta et al .",
    "for instance , a model where the sfh is rising at all @xmath7 as @xmath113 ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) is ruled out at the 95% cl for time delays @xmath115 gyr .",
    "the constraints are weakest when a long delay time , @xmath116 gyr , is considered , in which case only sfh models combining a sharp increase at low redshift ( @xmath117 ) that continues to rise steeply at high redshifts ( @xmath118 ) are ruled out at the 95% cl , and are thus disfavored by the data regardless of @xmath1 . in conclusion , even with a small sample of 11 sne  ia , it appears that the sn  ia redshift distribution can be used to set interesting limits on the sfh and the characteristic delay time of sne  ia .",
    "we now consider possible caveats that might relax the constraints we have found",
    ". these may be due to some weakness in the model we have employed , or to effects related to the data set we have used .",
    "we discuss both possibilities below .",
    "our model includes two main parameterised components  the sfh and the sn  ia delay function .",
    "our treatment of the sfh is fairly robust , since our parameterization covers the entire range of sfh functions reported in the literature . as for the sn  ia",
    "delay function , if sne  ia are descended from a single or dominant type of progenitor , it will be reasonable to assume that there is a characteristic time delay between the formation of these systems and the sn explosion .",
    "our parameterised models qualitatively reproduce the main features of most of the possible delay functions calculated for specific progenitor models by ruiz - lapuente & canal ( 1998 ) and yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) . a fastly rising and then monotonically declining delay function is also consistent with the observation that the rate of sne  ia appears to be higher among young stellar populations than among older ones ( e.g. , della valle & livio 1994 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2003 ) , however , the functional dependence could be quite different .    to further test the sensitivity of our results to the exact form of the delay function , we have redone our calculations using the alternative parameterization introduced by df , who replace the exponential distribution of explosion times used by mdp by a discrete value of the delay @xmath1 .",
    "the progenitor mass then uniquely determines the delay time between the system formation and the sn  ia explosion .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown in figure 5 .",
    "comparing with figure 4 , we can see that all the main findings we obtained using the mdp delay functions are reproduced , and are in fact strengthened .",
    "as expected , because the delay time is no longer given by an extended function , the sn redshift distribution between @xmath55 is influenced only by the low-@xmath7 sfh index @xmath67 for short delay times ( @xmath119 gyr ) and only by the high-@xmath7 sfh index @xmath64 for long delay times ( @xmath120 gyr ) .",
    "as before , for short delay times ( @xmath121 gyr ) the data require a gently rising sfh ( @xmath69 ) . for longer delay times ( @xmath122 gyr )",
    "we can rule out ( at the @xmath4 cl ) sfh models with a sharp rise at high  @xmath7 ( @xmath118 ) while the models involving also a sharp rise also at low  @xmath7 ( @xmath118 , @xmath117 ) are ruled out at the @xmath123 cl regardless of the time delay .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , hamuy et al .",
    "1995 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ; howell 2001 ) have suggested that some `` peculiar '' sne  ia ( overluminous , sn 1991t - like , and underluminous , sn 1991bg - like ) may result from distinct subgroups of progenitors . it could therefore be argued that we should consider also models using two or more characteristic delay times .",
    "however , it has been shown that high-@xmath7 sne  ia , which dominate the sample we have considered , are at least as uniform , both spectroscopically and photometrically , as local `` normal '' sne  ia ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter 1999 , and references within ) . indeed , li et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report that both overluminous and underluminous sne have not been detected at high@xmath12 so far .",
    "overluminous sne would be over - represented in high  @xmath7 samples .",
    "their apparent absence probably rules our the possibility that such events are common at high  @xmath7 .    to check",
    "what effect an undetected population of underluminous events would have on our results , we have constructed a set of sn light curves that have peak magnitude and light curve shape similar to those of the prototypical underluminous sn  ia , sn 1991bg .",
    "we then computed the effective visibility time using a mix of sne  ia that includes @xmath124 1991bg - like events , similar to the fraction found by li et al .",
    "( 2001 ) among local sne  ia .",
    "due to their relative faintness , the redshift distribution of underluminous sne  ia peaks around @xmath125 ( compared to @xmath126 for normal events , fig 1d ) .",
    "we find that this typically leads to an increase of @xmath127 to the total sn  ia distribution at this redshift .",
    "we noted above that the models calculated in section @xmath128 , and which fail to fit the data , underpredict the number of sne  ia at intermediate redshift ( @xmath125 ) relative to those at higher redshifts .",
    "thus , the addition of sne  ia at intermediate redshifts due to an underluminous sn population slightly weakens some the results reported above .",
    "for instance , assuming a madau et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sfh now requires @xmath129 gyr at the @xmath3 cl , while a lanzetta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) sfh can be accomodated if @xmath130 gyr at the @xmath3 cl .",
    "other limits are not relaxed  short ( @xmath131 gyr ) delay times require slowly varying sfh at @xmath132 ( @xmath111 ) , and steep , monotonically rising sfh ( @xmath133 ) are ruled out at @xmath4 confidence regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , an undetected population of underluminous high-@xmath7 sne , if it exists , does not significantly alter our results .    with regard to the data set we have analyzed",
    ", one may speculate that perhaps the observers excluded some sne that should have been included in the sample , and may have thus affected the observed redshift distribution .",
    "however , in their analysis , pain et al .",
    "( 2002 ) investigated all variable sources that could have been sne  ia and which satisfied their search criteria .",
    "they determined whether or not each candidate was a sn  ia , based on spectroscopy and light curve shapes , leaving no unidentified sources .",
    "we have verified that the efficiency curves we have used are consistent with the selection criteria used by pain et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in compiling the sn sample shown in table 1 .",
    "finally , we consider potential applications of this analysis to future , larger , sn samples .",
    "we have created two simulated data sets .",
    "the first simulated data set consists of 100 sne drawn from the expected distribution calculated for a survey with limiting magnitude @xmath134 , a `` madau '' sfh ( @xmath65 , @xmath68 ) , and a typical time delay of @xmath135 gyr . a second sample of 1000 sne from a deeper survey to @xmath136 mag is produced using the same model parameters .",
    "we then treated each sample as real data and found constraints that could be drawn on the @xmath137 parameter space .",
    "samples similar to these synthetic sets are expected from ongoing or forthcoming sn search programs such as essence ( smith et al . 2002 ; garnavich et al . 2002 ) , snls ( pain et al . 2002 ) , snap ( perlmutter et al .",
    "2002 ) and the lsst ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows results of the first simulation . a data set of 100 sne reaching @xmath134 mag",
    "should be a powerful tool to test the sfh and sn  ia delay times .",
    "while the input model ( @xmath138 ) is consistent with the data ( p=0.49 ) , significant portions of the parameter space are ruled out .",
    "however , the degeneracy between the sfh indices @xmath64 and @xmath67 , and the sn  ia delay time @xmath1 persists , and the data can not constrain each parameter individually .    figure 7 shows the constraints that can be drawn from the larger , deeper sample . the `` correct '' model ( @xmath138 ) is recovered with a probability value of @xmath139 .",
    "note that the degeneracy between the form of the sfh and the sn  ia delay time is now broken .",
    "shallow sfhs at low@xmath12 @xmath140 and long delay times ( @xmath141 ) are strongly ruled out by the data .",
    "shorter delay times set strong constraints on the allowed values of the sfh indices @xmath64 and @xmath67 .",
    "we have calculated the expected redshift distribution of sne  ia in a magnitude limited survey for a wide set of model parameters , and compared our calculations with observations of high-@xmath7 sne by the scp .",
    "we have shown that this approach is significantly more powerful than comparing expected and observed sn rates , because of the redshift binning involved in deriving sn  ia rates .",
    "we confirm and quantify the findings of pain et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which suggest that the redshift distribution of sne  ia at @xmath55 disfavor a strong variation of the sn  ia rate during this period .",
    "thus , if the sfh between @xmath18 and @xmath142 is steeper than @xmath143 , the delay time of sne  ia must be long ( @xmath144 gyr ) .",
    "we show that , even for longer delay times ( @xmath122 gyr ) , the data set interesting constraints on the sfh . generally , strongly rising sfhs , similar to those advocated by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , fit the data poorly , and sfh models which rise steeply at low redshifts ( @xmath117 ) and continue to rise at high redshifts ( @xmath66 ) are ruled out by the data at the @xmath4 cl , unless @xmath145 gyr . turning the argument around , given some determinations of the sfh ( e.g. , madau et al . 1998 )",
    ", we can constrain the characteristic delay time of sne  ia to be @xmath146 gyr ( @xmath147 gyr ) at the @xmath3 cl .    as already noted ,",
    "yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) have studied the delay functions of different sne  ia progenitor systems . in their double - degenerate ( dd ) model ,",
    "two wds merge , with the resulting wd reaching ( or surpassing ) the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "single degenerate models include accretion of he - rich material from a non - degenerate companion , leading to helium ignition on the wd surface and an edge - lit detonation ( he - eld ) .",
    "alternatively , h - rich material from a main sequence companion is accreted and processed on the wd surface , and results either in an edge - lit detonation due to accumulated helium ( ms - eld ) or to central carbon ignition as the wd reaches the chandrasekhar mass ( ms - ch ) .",
    "the delay functions calculated for these models are more complex than the parameterised mdp forms we have used , but generic similarities exist . in particular , both dd and he - eld curves can be characterised by a fast onset of sne  ia , some @xmath148 years after star formation , followed by gradual increase and a decline that terminates in a sharp , exponential cutoff after @xmath22 gyr for the he - eld and @xmath149 gyr for the dd models .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the mdp exponential formulation we use .",
    "the ms - ch model can be approximated by a df - like model with a delay time of @xmath22 gyr , so can be constrained by our calculation using this parameterization ( @xmath39 , figure 5 ) .",
    "the ms - eld is more complex , with a delayed onset of sne  ia , about @xmath150 gyr after star formation , followed by an approximately power - law decline lasting some @xmath151 gyr .    if we consider those sfh determinations requiring long time delays in our models ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1998 ; lanzetta et al . 2002 ) , then the data disfavor the ms - ch and he - eld progenitor models .",
    "we have shown that larger samples of sne  ia , that will be obtained by future sn search programs , some of which are already in progress , could be used to obtain even stronger constraints on the sfh and sn  ia models .    in a companion paper ( maoz & gal - yam 2003 ) , we study the implications of the measured sn  ia rates in @xmath19 galaxy clusters on the nature of sn  ia progenitors and the source of iron in clusters .",
    "we demonstrate there that , if sne  ia have produced most of the iron in galaxy clusters , and the stars in clusters formed at @xmath8 , then the sn  ia delay time must be _ lower _ than @xmath9  gyr .",
    "thus , if both conditions were met , then the lanzetta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) sfh would be ruled out by the data presented here .    finally , it is interesting to note here that most previous authors have considered core - collapse sne , whose rates closely track the sfh , as promising indicators for sfh measurement ( but see df 1999 for an alternative view ) . in principle , our methods could easily be applied also to high-@xmath7 core - collapse sn samples , if and when they become available . however , recent work by mannucci et al .",
    "( 2003 ) has shown that the majority of core - collapse events in star - forming galaxies suffers from strong dust extinction .",
    "sfh measurements using core - collapse sne thus share the same problems that make uv - determined sfhs so widely debated  the strong dependence of the derived sfh on the little known amount and properties of dust at high redshifts . in contrast , most sne  ia probably occur in relatively dust - free environments .",
    "thus , measurements of the sfh using sne  ia , through methods similar to the ones we have discussed here , may provide an attractive alternative to sfhs based on uv and emission line fluxes .",
