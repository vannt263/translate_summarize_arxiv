    "miniboone  @xcite is a neutrino oscillation experiment at fermilab , designed to confirm or rule out the hypothesis that the lsnd @xmath0 excess  @xcite is due to @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "a general description of the experiment can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "heretofore , miniboone has been taking data in neutrino mode , searching for @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "however , in some scenarios involving cp and cpt violation , oscillations may occur only in antineutrinos .",
    "thus , searching for oscillations in antineutrinos is a crucial test  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the search for cp violation in the neutrino sector by future off - axis experiments  @xcite requires @xmath1 oscillation measurements , as well as @xmath2 .",
    "the signature for cp violation is an asymmetry in these oscillation probabilities , but this can only be confirmed if the precision of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cross sections are smaller than the observed asymmetry .",
    "there are few @xmath3 cross section data published  @xcite to date , but even fewer measurements of low energy @xmath4 cross sections .",
    "we will need more and better data if we hope to find cp violation in the neutrino sector .",
    ".__event rates expected in miniboone @xmath4 running with @xmath5 pot assuming a 550 cm fiducial volume , before cuts . listed",
    "are the expected right - sign ( rs ) and wrong - sign ( ws ) events for each reaction channel . _",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to use this technique to constrain the ws background , the angular resolution for muons must be sufficiently good to separate the two populations .",
    "miniboone s angular resolution is measured using the cosmic muon calibration system , which consists of a muon tracker hodoscope placed above the detector .",
    "figure  [ fig : mutr_delmt ] shows the 4@xmath6 angular resolution of muons between 400 and 500 mev .",
    "this resolution is sufficient to allow exploitation of the angular differences in the ccqe outgoing muons distributions .",
    "the angular distributions can be fitted to extract the wrong - sign contribution .",
    "analysis of our monte carlo data sets indicates that the wrong - sign content can be measured using this technique , with a statistical uncertainty of 5% of itself  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : muang_recon ] , which shows the reconstructed angle of the out - going lepton with respect to the neutrino beam axis for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 cc qe events generated with the miniboone monte carlo , after all selection cuts have been applied . including systematic uncertainties and ( non - qe ) backgrounds increases the uncertainty on the ws extraction only to @xmath9 .      a second constraint results from measuring the rate at which muons decay in the miniboone detector . due to an @xmath10 @xmath11 capture probability in mineral oil ,",
    "negatively and positively charged muons exhibit different effective lifetimes ( @xmath12 for @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath13 for @xmath14  @xcite ) . to extract the ws fraction ,",
    "one simply fits the muon lifetime with a sum of two exponentials , with the extracted fraction of each exponential term giving the fraction of rs or ws events . for ccqe events , we find that the wrong - sign contribution can be extracted with a @xmath15 statistical uncertainty based solely on this lifetime difference and negligible systematic uncertainties . while not as precise as fits to the muon angular distributions , this particular constraint is unique , as it is independent of kinematics .",
    "our third wrong - sign constraint employs the the fact that antineutrinos do not create cc@xmath16 events in the detector ",
    "these all stem from neutrinos ( table  [ table : nubar - event - stats ] ) .",
    "miniboone identifies cc@xmath16 events by tagging the two decay electrons that follow the primary neutrino interaction , one from the @xmath11 and one from the @xmath17 decay  @xcite .",
    "however , cc@xmath18 events do not pass this requirement because all the emitted @xmath19 s which stop in the detector descend into atomic orbits around carbon nuclei and are instantly captured , leaving no decay electrons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 decay in flight rate is much smaller than the rate of @xmath17 decays at rest  @xcite .",
    "thus , applying the two michel cut to the full sample , which is @xmath20 antineutrino ( rs ) interactions , yields an @xmath21 pure sample of ws neutrino events .",
    "assuming conservative uncertainties for the antineutrino background events and the cc@xmath16 cross section , which is currently being measured by miniboone , we expect a @xmath22 uncertainty on the wrong - sign content in the beam given @xmath5 pot .",
    "this constraint is complementary to the muon angular distributions , because cc@xmath16 events stem mainly from resonance decays , thus constraining the wrong - sign content at larger neutrino energies .",
    "miniboone expects more than 40,000 qe interactions in antineutrino mode with @xmath5 pot before cuts .",
    "using the same qe event selection criteria as the previously reported miniboone neutrino analysis  @xcite yields a sample of @xmath23 events , with @xmath24 qe purity with both ws and rs events .    assuming the above wrong - sign constraints and conservative errors on the @xmath3 flux , backgrounds , and event detection",
    ", we expect a miniboone measurement of the @xmath8 qe cross section to better than @xmath25 with @xmath5 pot .",
    "@xmath8 neutral current ( nc ) @xmath26 production is one of the largest backgrounds to future @xmath1 oscillation searches .",
    "there has been only one published measurement of the absolute rate of this channel , with @xmath27 uncertainty at 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "applying miniboone s @xmath7 nc @xmath26 cuts  @xcite with no modifications leaves a sample of antineutrino nc @xmath26 events with a similar event purity and efficiency . after this selection ,",
    "we expect 1,650 @xmath8 resonant nc @xmath26 events and 1,640 @xmath8 coherent nc @xmath26 events assuming @xmath5 pot and the rein and sehgal model of coherent pion production  @xcite .",
    "coherent pion production has a characteristic pion angular distribution that allows it to be distinguished from resonant production , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : ncpi0-nu ] and [ fig : ncpi0-nubar ] .",
    "moreover , the previously mentioned figures illustrate that the distinctiveness of the angular distributions should be even more marked in antineutrino running , which increases the value of antineutrino data for understanding coherent production .",
    "the background of @xmath28  1000 ws events will be determined by the constraints on the wrong - sign content in the beam as described in section  [ sec : ws - constraints ] and the measurement of the @xmath7 nc @xmath26 cross section from miniboone neutrino data .",
    "miniboone expects roughly 7,000 resonant cc @xmath18 with @xmath5 pot before cuts . as discussed above ,",
    "almost all of the emitted @xmath19 s will be absorbed by carbon nuclei , and will therefore not be selected by the cc1@xmath17 cuts .",
    "nevertheless , these events still have a signature : two cherenkov rings ( one each from the @xmath14 and @xmath19 ) and one michel electron in the vicinity of the @xmath11 . the selection efficiency and purity of such events",
    "is unknown at this time .",
    "further investigation is currently underway .",
    "although miniboone has been searching for oscillations in neutrino mode , the lsnd oscillation signal was actually an excess of antineutrino events . because of the potential for finding cp violation in the neutrino sector , it is imperative that miniboone test the lsnd oscillation hypothesis with antineutrino data  @xcite",
    ".    figure  [ fig : nuebar - app ] shows an estimate of the miniboone sensitivity to @xmath1 oscillations under the assumption that @xmath2 oscillations do not occur , i.e. assuming miniboone sees no @xmath29 appearance signal . here",
    ", we compare the sensitivity to the joint karmen - lsnd region ( @xmath4 only )  @xcite , not the full lsnd allowed region ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is a statistics - limited search ; further running is needed beyond the @xmath5 pot assumed in the preceding sections in order to test the lsnd hypothesis .",
    "this sensitivity shown assumes @xmath31 pot .",
    "we have developed three techniques for determining the wrong - sign background in antineutrino mode . the resulting systematic error on",
    "any given @xmath4 cross section measurement due to the wrong sign contamination should be less than 2% averaged over the entire flux , which is remarkable for a detector which does not possess event - by - event sign selection . given this redundant approach , the wrong - sign contamination should not be considered prohibitive to producing meaningful antineutrino cross section  @xcite and oscillation measurements  @xcite at miniboone .",
    "these techniques may also be useful for other experiments without magnetized detectors which have plans to study antineutrino interactions ( _ e.g. _ t2k , no@xmath3a , super - k ) .",
    "miniboone began running in antineutrino mode on 19 january , 2006 , and is currently approved to run for one more year . in order to truly confirm or rule out the lsnd oscillation hypothesis , miniboone needs 6@xmath32 pot , which will require additional years of running .",
