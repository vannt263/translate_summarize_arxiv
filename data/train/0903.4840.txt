    "the kuramoto model @xcite has become the basic framework for the description of macroscopic synchronization ; a phenomenon observed in a variety of natural and artificial systems  @xcite .",
    "kuramoto @xcite considered a population of all - to - all weakly coupled oscillators such that their interaction could be reduced to their phases : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the phase and the natural frequency of the @xmath6-th oscillator , and @xmath7 is the coupling strength .",
    "kuramoto adopted a sinusoidal coupling function @xmath8 together with a symmetric frequency distribution of the natural frequencies , what resulted very useful for the theoretical analysis of the model .",
    "originally , it was useful and instructive to consider the thermodynamic limit of ( [ kuramoto_model ] ) , @xmath9 .",
    "finite - size effects have remained unsolved for a long time and only recently significative advances have been achieved @xcite . also some attention has been recently devoted to the small-@xmath1 behavior of the kuramoto model by maistrenko and coworkers from the point of view of dynamical systems theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the kuramoto model with a finite population , and with the natural frequencies allocated symmetrically around the mean frequency .",
    "one of the reasons that motivates this problem is the fact that most works on the kuramoto model have assumed that the natural frequencies are distributed according to a symmetric probability density , and as a consequence it is usual that numerical simulations are carried out selecting frequencies not at random , but reflecting the inherent symmetry of the frequency distribution . in particular , several works  @xcite have recently investigated phase diagrams of the kuramoto model with a finite population @xmath1 under the assumption that the natural frequencies are allocated symmetrically .",
    "it has been shown that under these assumptions , finite @xmath1 and symmetry of the natural frequencies , model ( [ kuramoto_model ] ) exhibits a peculiar type of chaos dubbed ` phase chaos ' .    of more importance for this work",
    "is the finding in @xcite that the phase space contains an @xmath0$]-dimensional invariant torus .",
    "this torus has been thought to be unstable ( _ i.e. _  repelling ) when @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this belief is probably motivated by the difficulty of investigating numerically the phase diagram for small @xmath7 due to the extremely weak ( in)stability of invariant sets in that limit .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to reveal the phase diagrams of the kuramoto model at small coupling and different values of @xmath1 .",
    "our analytical results are obtained by using the renormalization group ( rg ) method , which is one of the singular perturbation methods .",
    "our results firmly establish the stability of the mentioned invariant torus on rigorous mathematical grounds .",
    "in particular , we give general results for any finite @xmath1 , and some small populations ( @xmath11 ) are investigated in more detail .",
    "due to the mean - field character of the kuramoto model we may arbitrarily label the natural frequencies from the smaller to the larger : @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , by going into a suitable rotating framework we set the mean frequency equal to zero without loss of generality . for the discussion to follow it is worth to note",
    "that if there are not coincident natural frequencies ( _ i.e. _ @xmath13 ) , some degree of synchronization , @xmath14 for some ( or all ) @xmath15 , is only achieved for a coupling strength larger than some positive constant @xmath16 .",
    "next , we rewrite the kuramoto model for the convenience of our analysis . due to the invariance of the global quantity @xmath17 , the kuramoto model can be reduced in one dimension by changing to a new set of coordinates : @xmath18 .",
    "it is also useful to define  frequency gaps \" @xmath19 . in the new variables the kuramoto model has this structure @xmath20    maistrenko and coworkers  @xcite found that if the natural frequencies are symmetrically selected ( @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 ) the kuramoto model has an invariant manifold @xmath24 , namely a torus of dimension @xmath0 $ ] , which is given by @xmath25 .",
    "( in the original coordinates , @xmath24 is any of the tori that parameterized by the invariant @xmath26 foliate an @xmath27 + 1)$]-dimensional torus ; thus if one selects @xmath28 , @xmath29 . )",
    "in refs .  @xcite it was shown that for some values of the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the dynamics approaches the invariant torus @xmath24 or an attractor @xmath32 .",
    "they reported that the regions of parameters with stable @xmath24 or @xmath33 are close to , or inside , synchronization regions ( what implies that @xmath7 is larger than some positive number if @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , there is a common belief that far from synchronization , as the coupling strength goes to zero ( @xmath35 ) , the dynamics fills the whole phase space , the @xmath2 dimensional torus @xmath36 .",
    "so far , many numerical results confirmed this expectation @xcite .",
    "however , we show in this paper that this is not true .",
    "we have found that in the limit @xmath37 :    1 .   if @xmath1 is odd the @xmath38-dimensional invariant torus @xmath24 is , unless there are special resonant conditions among the natural frequencies , asymptotically stable .",
    "2 .   if @xmath1 is even the @xmath39-dimensional invariant torus @xmath24 can be stable or unstable depending on the particular disposition of the natural frequencies .    statements ( i ) and ( ii ) are consequence of three theorems to be proved by using the rg method , which is a powerful singular perturbation method for differential equations proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently , mathematical foundation of the rg method was given in @xcite showing that the rg method is useful as well to investigate existence and stability of invariant manifolds .",
    "we present a brief review of the rg method in section 7.1 , and the proofs of the main theorems in this paper are shown in section 7.2 and 7.3 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the stability of the invariant torus @xmath24 for odd @xmath1 . for two particular cases , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the phase diagrams are completely uncovered .",
    "one of the main theorems in this paper is as follows : + * theorem 1 . *",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is an odd number . if the natural frequencies satisfy the following nonresonance condition : @xmath43 then there exists a positive constant @xmath44 , which depends on the natural frequencies , such that if @xmath45 , the invariant torus @xmath24 is asymptotically stable and the transverse lyapunov exponents of @xmath24 are of @xmath46 .",
    "+ equation  ( [ nrcondition ] ) can be rewritten as a condition for @xmath47 s by using the relation @xmath48 .",

    "there exist a @xmath51-dimensional stable torus on @xmath24 filled by @xmath51-frequency quasiperiodic orbits ( @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "further , we can prove that regions with phase - locking are narrower when the nonresonance condition is fulfilled than when it is not .",
    "below we test the validity of theorem 1 for @xmath40 , 5 , and 7 . focusing on particular cases will allow us to understand better how theorem 1 applies in practical terms .",
    "for instance , for @xmath53 we make a complete analysis of the stability of @xmath24 , showing what happens when the natural frequencies do not satisfy the nonresonance condition of theorem 1 .      for @xmath40",

    "our paper is particularly relevant because the kuramoto model has been usually considered together with a symmetric frequency distribution of the natural frequencies , and in turn simulations , with a finite population size , are often carried out selecting frequencies that reflect the inherent symmetry of the frequency density .",
    "our results also evidence the important role of resonances among the natural frequencies for the stability of the invariant torus @xmath24 . this must serve as a warning about the risks of using highly resonant frequencies when tackling generic properties of the system .",
    "in particular , it has become popular to consider evenly spaced natural frequencies ( @xmath180 for all @xmath181 ) , which is probably the most resonant case .",
    "we may conjecture that the results reported here for the kuramoto model ( with a sinusoidal coupling function ) should also be observed in a family of odd coupling functions .",

    "( [ f ] ) , a family of functions shares stability and scaling of the transverse lyapunov exponent .",
