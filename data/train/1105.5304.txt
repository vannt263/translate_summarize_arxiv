    "<S> the @xmath0 process is a primary nucleosynthesis process which occurs in core collapse supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> an essential role in this process is being played by electron antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> they generate , by absorption on protons , a supply of neutrons which , by @xmath1 reactions , allow to overcome waiting point nuclei with rather long beta - decay and proton - capture lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis of heavy elements by the @xmath0 process depends sensitively on the @xmath2 luminosity and spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> as has been shown recently , the latter are affected by collective neutrino flavor oscillations which can swap the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra above a certain split energy . </S>",
    "<S> assuming such a swap scenario , we have studied the impact of collective neutrino flavor oscillations on the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the production of light @xmath5-nuclei up to mass number @xmath6 is very sensitive to collective neutrino oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> explosive nucleosynthesis , @xmath0 process , core collapse supernova , collective neutrino oscillations 26.30.@xmath7k , 97.60.bw    core - collapse supernova explosions have been identified as the site for explosive nucleosynthesis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest here is matter that is ejected from the surface of the newly born neutron star due to late - time neutrino heating , known as the neutrino - driven wind . </S>",
    "<S> it develops on timescales of seconds after the onset of the explosion . due to the high temperatures at the surface , </S>",
    "<S> this matter is ejected as free protons and neutrons . upon reaching cooler regions with increasing distance from the neutron star </S>",
    "<S> , nucleons can be combined into nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of this nucleosynthesis depends on the proton - to - baryon ratio of the ejected matter . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is determined by the competition of electron neutrino and antineutrino absorption on nucleons and their inverse reactions ,    @xmath8    it strongly depends on the neutrino and antineutrino luminosities and spectra . </S>",
    "<S> simulations   indicate that in an early phase of the explosion , the ejected matter is proton - rich ; i.e. the proton - to - neutron ratio @xmath9 is larger than 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> when this proton - rich matter expands and cools , nuclei can form resulting in a composition dominated by @xmath10 nuclei , mainly @xmath11ni and @xmath12he , and protons  @xcite . without the further inclusion of neutrino and antineutrino reactions the composition of this matter will finally consist of protons , alpha - particles , and heavy ( fe - group ) nuclei ( in nucleosynthesis terms a proton- and alpha - rich freeze - out ) , with enhanced abundances of @xmath13sc , @xmath14ti , and @xmath15zn  @xcite , solving the longstanding puzzle of underproduction of these elements in stellar nucleosynthesis studies . </S>",
    "<S> the matter flow stops at @xmath16 , due to the long beta - decay half - live of @xmath15ge , 63.7(25 )  s , which is much longer than the expansion time scale , and the small proton separation energy of @xmath17as , @xmath18  kev  @xcite , which suppresses proton capture on @xmath15ge at the high temperatures involved .    however , neutrino reactions play an essential role during the nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 nuclei are practically inert to neutrino captures ( which convert a neutron into a proton ) , because such reactions are endoergic for neutron - deficient nuclei located away from the valley of stability . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different for electron antineutrinos that are captured in a typical time of a few seconds , both on protons and nuclei , at distances of @xmath20  km . </S>",
    "<S> this time scale is much shorter than the beta - decay half - lives of the most abundant heavy nuclei reached without neutrino interactions ( e.g.@xmath11ni , @xmath15ge ) . </S>",
    "<S> as protons are more abundant than heavy nuclei , electron antineutrino capture occurs predominantly on protons , causing a residual density of free neutrons of @xmath21@xmath22  @xmath23 for several seconds , when the temperatures are in the range of 13  @xmath24  k. these neutrons allow now the matter flow to overcome waiting point nuclei like @xmath15ge via @xmath1 reactions and to continue to heavier nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the associated nucleosynthesis process is called the @xmath25-process  .     and @xmath4 spectra @xmath26 and @xmath27 based on the simulations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as given in table 1 of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath28 spectra have been arbitrarily normalized to one while the @xmath29 spectra are normalized to 1.3 to keep the relative ratio of the number luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> lower part : modified spectra @xmath30 and @xmath31 , including the effects of collective neutrino oscillations , which induce a swap of the @xmath32 and @xmath29 spectra for energies above @xmath33  mev based on the normal mass herarchy calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .[fig : spectra ] ]    how far the massflow can proceed in the @xmath0 process strongly depends on the environment conditions . in particular , the sensitivity to the temperature at neutrino - driven wind termination and the @xmath9 value of the ejected matter has been investigated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the sensitivity to the luminosity and spectrum of electron antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> these are expected to be affected by collective neutrino flavor oscillations that occur in the high - neutrino - density environment surrounding the neutron star , see  @xcite for a recent review . several studies   have shown that collective neutrino oscillations swap the spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath4 neutrinos in certain energy intervals bounded by sharp spectral splits . </S>",
    "<S> the split energy depends on the relative fluxes of @xmath2 and @xmath4 and on the neutrino mass hierarchy  @xcite . in the following , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] we assume that collective neutrino flavor oscillations exchange the spectra of @xmath34 and @xmath4 above a certain split energy as found by dasgupta _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the case of normal mass hierarchy .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 have a larger mean energy and a larger high - energy tail than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by the fact that , besides their interactions by neutral - current reactions , @xmath2 also interact with the dense neutron star matter by charge current reactions ( which is energetically not possible for supernova @xmath4 antineutrinos ) and hence decouple at slightly larger radii and lower temperatures . due to the high - energy enhancement of @xmath35 , collective neutrino flavor oscillations are expected to increase the neutron production rate by antineutrino absorption on protons during the @xmath0 process and hence its efficiency to synthesize heavy elements .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that collective neutrino flavor oscillations do not change the @xmath9 value which is determined by electron neutrino and antineutrino absorptions on nucleons close to the neutron star surface . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we assume that collective neutrino oscillations occur before the onset of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis at distances of @xmath20  km . </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions are consistent with the recent multi - angle calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthemore , there are no free neutrons present and @xmath19 nuclei are practically innert to neutrino absorptions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the impact of collective neutrino flavor oscillations on @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis is to modify the rate of antineutrino absorption on protons and hence the neutron production rate .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevant absorption rate at distance @xmath36 from the neutron star center is defined as follows , @xmath37 with @xmath38 the absorption cross section for antineutrinos of energy @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> for the neutrino spectra we adopt the following distribution  @xcite :    @xmath40    with the neutrino number luminosity , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the mean neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath43 is fixed by the relation :    @xmath44    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that such an @xmath43 distribution gives a good description of the neutrino spectra calculated in supernova simulations  @xcite .    with the assumptions above , the @xmath2 spectrum , @xmath45 , modified by collective neutrino oscillations is    @xmath46    according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we expect the split energy , @xmath47 , to be around 18  mev ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spectra ] ) .     of the neutron production rate with respect to the split energy @xmath47 , calculated for the antineutrino spectra shown in the upper part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gamma ] ]    the modification of the antineutrino spectrum will affect the neutron production rate by antineutrino absorption on protons , which in turn will alter the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis . to quantify these effects , we define the change in the neutron production rate as :    @xmath48    to calculate the @xmath49 factor we approximate the antineutrino absorption cross section by    @xmath50    where @xmath51  mev is the neutron - proton mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation suffices to calculate @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the nucleosynthesis studies we use a cross section which also considers weak magnetism and nucleon recoil corrections  @xcite    our nucleosynthesis calculations are based on the supernova simulations of a 15  m@xmath52 star  @xcite and its associated nucleosynthesis  . in particular , luminosities and </S>",
    "<S> spectra parameters for all neutrino flavors are given in table 1 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have approximated these spectra by an @xmath43-distribution , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : alphas ] ) . for the @xmath32 spectrum </S>",
    "<S> we find the parameter @xmath53 and an average neutrino energy @xmath54  mev , while for the @xmath55 flavor these parameters are @xmath56 and @xmath57  mev . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra @xmath58 and @xmath59 are plotted in the upper part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lower panel shows the modified @xmath2 spectrum including the effect of collective neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the increased flux of @xmath2 neutrinos with @xmath60 in the modified spectrum . due to the energy dependence of the neutrino absorption cross section , </S>",
    "<S> see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cross ] ) , this increase of high - energy neutrinos will enhance the neutron production rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gamma ] that shows the neutron production rate to be increased by a factor @xmath61 due to collective neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we also observe that @xmath49 is relatively insensitive to the unknown split energy @xmath47 , in the range up to 25  mev . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to describe the effect of collective neutrino oscillations in @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis studies by scaling the antineutrino absorption rate by a constant factor @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered this scaling for radii larger than 500 km , corresponding to temperatures smaller than 3  gk at which the @xmath25 process operates .    </S>",
    "<S> -process nucleosynthesis studies with @xmath62 , hence considering collective neutrino oscillations , and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower panel shows the ratio of overproduction factors for the two nucleosynthesis studies as function of mass number . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : abund ] ]    adopting @xmath62 from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gamma ] we have performed a nucleosynthesis calculation using a sufficiently large nuclear network considering rates for reactions mediated by the strong , electromagnetic and weak interaction and involving nuclei in the mass range up to the europium isotopes ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for additional details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of temperature , density and @xmath9 corresponds to the trajectory labelled `` 1116 ms '' shown in figure  3 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance distributions of elements heavier than @xmath16 are compared to those obtained in a calculation , in which we choose @xmath63 and kept all other quantities the same . </S>",
    "<S> this study hence corresponds to a standard @xmath25-process calculation without consideration of collective neutrino oscillations . in fig  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : abund ] , we show the calculated ` overproduction factors ' for both nucleosynthesis studies defined by the ratio @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the produced mass of isotope @xmath66 and @xmath67 is its solar mass fraction . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass ejected in the supernova simulation , @xmath68 , is taken from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced neutron production due to collective neutrino oscillations has two interesting consequences . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it increases the abundances of nuclei heavier than @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the abundances of light @xmath5-nuclides ( @xmath70mo , @xmath71ru ) , whose production might be attributed to the @xmath0 process , are enhanced by factors 23 . </S>",
    "<S> the increase becomes more significant for nuclides with @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the enhanced rate for neutron production increases the number of neutrons that can induce @xmath1 reactions on heavy nuclei . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it reduces the timescale of this reaction on the @xmath73 nucleus @xmath74pd which acts like a `` seed '' for the production of nuclei with @xmath72  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that , in addition to the uncertainties in the supernova dynamics and the nuclear physics input discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , collective neutrino oscillations play a very important role to determine if the @xmath0 process can contribute to the solar inventory of light @xmath5-nuclei up to @xmath6 ( @xmath75cd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the production of heavier @xmath5-nuclei must be likely attributed to other nucleosynthesis processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the overproduction factors for nuclei with mass numbers @xmath76 , and 76 are slightly reduced in a @xmath0 process which considers collective neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that their progenitors , the @xmath43-nuclei like @xmath15ge or @xmath77se , serve as waiting points in the mass flow to heavier elements . </S>",
    "<S> as these waiting points are overcome by @xmath1 reactions within @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis , the availability of a larger amount of free neutrons during the nucleosynthesis process makes the lifetimes of the @xmath43 nuclei against @xmath1 reactions shorter . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , less matter is halted at the waiting points , reflected in the smaller abundances of nuclides like @xmath15zn and @xmath77zn , which are produced via the @xmath43-nuclei progenitors .    </S>",
    "<S> recent supernova simulations  @xcite show that the @xmath78 and @xmath79 spectra become increasingly similar with time after the onset of the explosion , being identical after around 10  s  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , it has been recently shown that collective neutrino flavor oscillations are suppressed during the early accretion phase of the supernova explosion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we expect a reduced impact of collective neutrino oscillations on nucleosynthesis studies both at early and late times . </S>",
    "<S> we also find smaller @xmath49 factors if we calculate the enhancement in the neutron production ratio using the neutrino spectra published for the simulations of a onemg core 8.8  m@xmath52 star  @xcite and a iron - core 10.8  m@xmath52 star  @xcite . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 is larger than 1 , i.e. collective neutrino oscillations lead to increased neutron production but the obtained values , around 1  s after the explosion , @xmath80 ( 8.8  m@xmath52 star ) and 1.3 ( 10.8  m@xmath52 star ) are smaller than discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> we have repeated the nucleosynthesis calculations with these @xmath49 factors . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the overproduction factor of the elements with @xmath81 grows nearly linear with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the overproduction factor of @xmath74ru is 2.3 for @xmath82 , while it is nearly 3 for @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have studied @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis considering the impact of collective neutrino flavor oscillations . in accordance with recent studies we assume that these result in a complete swap in the spectra of electron and non - electron flavors above a certain split energy . </S>",
    "<S> this swap results in enhanced electron antineutrino captures . adopting antineutrino spectra from recent supernova simulations </S>",
    "<S> we find that this enhanced capture increases the amount of free neutrons , present during @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis , by 2040% . </S>",
    "<S> this larger supply of neutrons boosts the matter flow to heavier nuclides and results in larger abundances of nuclides with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> our current study makes the simplifying assumption that the collective neutrino flavor oscillations occur before the onset of @xmath25 nucleosynthesis which allows to approximate their effect by a constant increase of the neutron production rate . due to the intriguing effect of the oscillations on the production of light @xmath5 nuclides </S>",
    "<S> , we are planning to improve on our current study . </S>",
    "<S> we will perform nucleosynthesis calculations that consistently include collective neutrino flavor oscillations based on neutrino spectra and trajectories from simulations of supernova explosions . </S>"
