    "the @xmath0 decay process was first explained by gamow  gam28 and by condon and gurney  @xcite in 1928 as a quantum tunneling effect and it is one of the first examples proving the need to use the quantum mechanics to describe nuclear phenomena and its correctness . on the basis of the gamow s theory ,",
    "the experimental @xmath0-decay half - lives of nuclei can be well explained by both phenomenological and microscopic models  del02,lov98,hod03,buck92,buck93,var94,wau93,gldm , rg1,zh1,zhang .",
    "such @xmath5-decay calculations are mainly concentrated on the favored cases , e.g. the ground state @xmath0-transitions of even - even nuclei ( @xmath6 )  @xcite . besides the favored @xmath0-transitions",
    ", the ground state of the parent nucleus can also decay to the excited states of the daughter nucleus ( @xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "recently , there is increasing interest in two kinds of @xmath0 transitions of even - even nuclei from both experimental and theoretical sides , i.e. the @xmath0-decay to excited 0@xmath1 states and to members of ground state rotational band  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0 transitions belong to the unfavored case , which are strongly hindered as compared with the ground state ones .",
    "theoretically , the hindered @xmath0-transition is an effective tool to study the properties of @xmath0-emitters because it is closely related to the internal structure of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to describe quantitatively the unfavored @xmath0-transitions due to the influence of both non - zero angular momentum and excitation of nucleons , especially for @xmath0-emitters in the neighbourhood of the shell closures .",
    "although the favored @xmath0-decay model can be straightforwardly applied to the unfavored @xmath0-transition , the calculated branching ratios usually deviate significantly from the experimental data .",
    "thus it is necessary to improve the favored @xmath0-decay model to describe the unfavored hindered @xmath0-decay .",
    "experimentally it is also very helpful to make theoretical predictions on unfavored hindered @xmath0-transitions for future studies .",

    ", the unfavored hindered @xmath0-transitions have not been investigated within the gldm . in this paper ,",
    "the gldm has been improved by taking into account the influence of the angular momentum of the @xmath0-particle and the excitation probability of the daughter nucleus , investigating the hindered @xmath0-transitions of even - even nuclei with mass numbers 180 @xmath8 a @xmath8 202 and a @xmath4",

    "some conclusions are drawn .",
    "in the favored @xmath0-decays , such as the ground state to ground state @xmath5-transitions of even - even nuclei , the angular momentum _",
    "l _ carried by the @xmath0-particle is 0 .",
    "thus in the former framework of the gldm , the centrifugal potential energy _ _ v__@xmath9 is not included  @xcite . in the case of the ground state of a parent nucleus to the ground state of its deformed daughter nucleus and to the excited state _ _",
    "i__@xmath1 , the angular momentum _",
    "l _ carried by the @xmath0-particle is not 0 . thus the centrifugal potential energy _ _ v__@xmath9 which can no more be neglected has been introduced into the gldm as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the distance between the two fragments and the reduced mass of the @xmath13-daughter system , respectively .",
    "the macroscopic gldm energy becomes @xmath14 when the nuclei are separated @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass numbers , charge numbers , radii and relative neutron excesses of the two nuclei .",
    "@xmath11 is the distance between the mass centers .",

    "@xmath28 is the electrostatic potential at the surface and @xmath29 the surface potential of the sphere .",
    "the surface energy results from the effects of the surface tension forces in a half space . when there are nucleons in regard in a neck or a gap between separated fragments an additional term called proximity energy must be added to take into account the effects of the nuclear forces between the close surfaces .",
    "this term is essential to describe smoothly the one - body to two - body transition and to obtain reasonable fusion barrier heights .",

    "the @xmath0 decay of 0@xmath37 transition requires that the @xmath0-particle carries an angular momentum of _ _ l__= _ i _ to satisfy angular momentum conservation and parity conservation .",
    "the @xmath13-decay energy from the ground state of a parent nucleus is related to the excitation energy of the _ _ i__@xmath1 states in the daughter nucleus .",

    "the residual daughter nucleus after disintegration has the most probability to stay in its ground state , and the probability to stay in its excited state is relatively much smaller .",

    "this excitation probability function has been added to the model with a value of the parameter _",
    "c _ fixed to 3.0 .",
    "this means that only a single parameter is introduced in the whole calculation .",
    "it is stressed that the inclusion of the excitation probability is reasonable in physics and it can lead to good agreement between experiment and theory . here _ _",
