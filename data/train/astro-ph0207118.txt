    "recently watts & andersson ( 2002 ) have considered the possibility of detecting gravitational radiation from a newly born neutron star in a supernova remnant . in their scenario ,",
    "debris of a supernova explosion ( typically @xmath3 ) falls back hypercritically ( @xmath4 ) onto a neutron star with a normal - strength magnetic field ( @xmath5 g ) and transfers angular momentum to the star .",
    "on the other hand , the r - mode instability which is driven by gravitational radiation , can extract angular momentum from the system quite efficiently . the accretion torque and the torque of gravitational radiation balance to give the star a characteristic rotational period of a few milliseconds . as a result",
    ", this system can be an efficient emitter of gravitational waves of nearly constant frequency for several years .",
    "their work indicates that for stars with a normal - strength magnetic field ( @xmath5 g ) , the system can be a promising source for gravitational wave .",
    "on the other hand , for moderately magnetized stars ( i.e. , @xmath6 g ) rezzolla et al .",
    "have argued that the coupling of r - modes with the magnetic field can prevent the instability from developing .",
    "thus the results by watts & andersson may not be relevant to the stars with rather strong magnetic fields ( @xmath7 g ) as a complementary study to theirs , we study here a similar system but with the neutron star having a much larger magnetic field ( @xmath8 g ) .",
    "magnetic fields of this strength are associated with the so - called _ magnetars _ ( duncan & thompson 1996 ) .",
    "when the magnetic field reaches such large intensities , the equilibrium configuration would be distorted by the magnetic tension considerably . in the case of an axisymmetric magnetic field ,",
    "the star will be deformed in an axisymmetric way aligned with the axis of the magnetic field ( bonazzola and gourgoulhon 1996 ) .",
    "if this symmetry axis is not aligned with the rotational one , this will produce a time varying quadrupole moment and lead to the emission of gravitational waves .    in this respect ,",
    "our system is quite different from the one considered by watts & andersson ( 2002 ) , since here gravitational radiation is not produced by the r - mode instability , and has only a passive role in the evolution of the system .",
    "the evolution of the system , i.e. , of the rotational angular frequency and of the mass , is regulated by the evolution of the accretion torque .    in particular , the so - called propeller mechanism ( pringle & rees 1972 , illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) becomes active rather early .",
    "( this mechanism consists of the in - falling matter being flung away from the stellar magnetosphere when the rotational frequency is larger than the local orbital frequency , because the centrifugal force on the matter exceeds the gravitational force . ) also the torque from magnetic dipole radiation may be important in the later phases for highly magnetized stars .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2 ,",
    "the formulation of our model is outlined . in the following section , the results , ( i.e. , the evolution of the stellar rotational frequency and the mass , the characteristic amplitudes of gravitational waves from the system , and the signal - to - noise ratio of gravitational wave for laser - interferometric detectors ) , are presented for several parameter sets . the final section contains the summary and some comments about our model .",
    "our model of the system is rather simplified and follows closely the one presented by watts & andersson ( 2002 ) .",
    "our description of the physical processes is rather idealized but , nevertheless , it allows the basic features of the gravitational wave emission from these systems to be appreciated .",
    "the star is assumed to be a newtonian polytrope with polytropic index @xmath0 , having radius @xmath9 and the mass @xmath10 .",
    "debris of the supernova falls back onto the star according to a simple power law of time , @xmath11 ( mineshige et al .",
    "1997 ; menou et al .",
    "note that this in general should be distinguished from the mass accretion rate onto the star @xmath12 , especially when the propeller mechanism is active .",
    "we assume that ,    @xmath13    the magnetospheric radius , at which the ram pressure of the in - falling matter balances the magnetic pressure , is defined by ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the surface polar field .",
    "the in - falling matter is stopped at around this radius .",
    "when @xmath16 , the magnetospheric radius defined by eq.([magrad ] ) is below the stellar surface and the effect of the magnetic field on the accreting matter flow is suppressed .",
    "the accretion flow is then assumed to be advection dominated ( we here adopt the description of narayan & yi 1994,1995 ) with an accretion torque , @xmath17 we should note that the behaviour of the in - falling matter is rather uncertain especially in the hypercritical regime in the presence of a strong magnetic field which possibly affects the motion of the matter .",
    "the magnetic field may produce a strong outflow or jet , and/or destroy the innermost structure of the in - falling flow and change it drastically .",
    "modeling these flows is beyond the scope of this paper and hereafter we will assume that the flow is described by that of a simple , advection - dominated disk .",
    "when @xmath18 exceeds @xmath9 , @xmath19 takes the form ( watts & andersson 2002 ) , @xmath20\\dot{m}_{_{fall}},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the rotational angular frequency of the star , and @xmath22 is the keplerian orbital frequency around the star at a radial distance @xmath23 .",
    "when the radius of the light cylinder @xmath24 of the star is smaller than @xmath18 , we also include the torque given by the magnetic dipole radiation ; with @xmath25 . ] @xmath26    we adopt as the condition for the appearance of the propeller effect , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    the evolution of the system is described by the time - variation of @xmath10 and @xmath21 ( note that @xmath9 is constant for this polytrope ) .",
    "the evolution equations are then , @xmath29 @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the helmholtz step function and @xmath32 is a dimensionless constant in terms of which the moment of inertia is given as @xmath33 .",
    "for an @xmath0 polytrope @xmath34 .",
    "following watts & andersson ( 2002 ) , we start integrating eqs.([massevolution ] ) and ( [ omegaevolution ] ) from @xmath35 after the bounce of the collapsing core , when a recognizable central compact object is thought to appear .",
    "we set the total amount of in - falling debris as @xmath36 ( typically @xmath3 ) .",
    "the integration is terminated if @xmath37 , when the hypercritical advection dominated accretion ceases ( chevalier 1989 , brown et al .",
    "the parameters defining the model are the following : 1 ) the initial time @xmath38 at which the time integration is started which we choose to be @xmath39s ( cf . watts & andersson 2002 ) ; 2 ) the total mass of in - falling matter , @xmath40 ; 3 ) the strength of the surface polar magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "4 ) the initial rotational frequency of the star @xmath41 . in what follows",
    ", we show the evolution of the mass and of the rotational frequency of systems with typical parameter sets .    in figs .",
    "[ bfix14 ] and [ bfix15 ] , the evolutionary curves of the mass ( upper panel ) and the rotational frequency ( lower panels ) are plotted . as the in - fall rate decreases",
    ", the propeller effect becomes active , and the matter can not accrete onto the star .",
    "this occurs earlier for stronger surface magnetic fields ( compare the upper panels of fig.[bfix14 ] and [ bfix15 ] ) .",
    "also , the torque produced by the magnetic dipole radiation is stronger for larger surface magnetic fields as a result , the rotational frequency decreases faster with stronger fields , for the same @xmath36 .",
    "also note that the asymptotic behaviour of the rotational evolution is rather insensitive to @xmath36 . in the later phases of the evolution ,",
    "the in - falling rate is so low that the angular frequency evolution is mainly driven by the magnetic dipole radiation term ( eq.([omegaevolution ] ) ) .",
    "thus the dependence on the in - fall rate can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , in the later phases of evolution the frequency converges to the same value , irrespective of the initial rotational frequency @xmath42 .",
    "this is also because in this phase the mass accretion rate is so small that the evolution of the frequency is solely determined by the magnetic dipole radiation . from eqs.([magdipole ] ) and ( [ omegaevolution ] ) , it is easy to see that the frequency behaves as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the ( arbitrary ) origin of the time .",
    "eq.([omegat ] ) shows that as @xmath46 , @xmath21 becomes independent of @xmath47 .",
    "gravitational waves from a star deformed by a magnetic field and having its rotation axis misaligned with respect to its magnetic axis , have been discussed by bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( 1996 ) .",
    "we here use their formula to estimate the dimensionless strain of gravitational waves .",
    "the strain of the produced gravitational waves observed on the earth depends not only on the misalignment angle of the rotational and magnetic axes , but also on the inclination angle of the system with respect to the line of sight to the observer ( see eqs.(20 ) and ( 21 ) of bonazzola & gourgoulhon 1996 ) .",
    "the factor which does not depend on these angles is found to be ( cf .",
    "eq.(25 ) of bonazzola & gourgoulhon 1996 ) : @xmath48 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{d}{1\\mbox{mpc}}\\right]^{-1 } \\left[\\frac{i}{10^{45}\\mbox{g}\\mbox{cm}^2}\\right ] \\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\left[\\frac{\\epsilon}{10^{-6}}\\right ] , \\label{eqh0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the rotational frequency , @xmath50 is the distance to the source , @xmath51 is the moment of inertia and @xmath52 is the ellipticity measuring the deformation of the star .",
    "thus far we have almost no information about the ellipticity produced by the magnetic field , except for the upper bounds on normal pulsars ( bonazzola & gourgoulhon 1996 ) . on the theoretical side , this is mostly due to the fact that we know hardly anything about the configuration of the magnetic field inside the star , although there have been works estimating the ellipticity ( bonazzola & gourgoulhon 1996 ; konno et al . 2000 ) .",
    "bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( 1996 ) have parametrized the ellipticity as , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the permeability of the vacuum and @xmath55 is the magnetic dipole moment of the star .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 depends on the configuration of the magnetic field in the star as well as on the compactness of the star . for a newtonian uniform density star with a uniform distribution of magnetic field , @xmath57",
    "bonazzola & goulgourhon ( 1996 ) obtained values of @xmath56 up to @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "konno et al . ( 2000 ) studied the effect of the compactness of the star assuming a dipolar field inside it , and found that the ellipticity can be enhanced by general relativistic effects .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath59 as a moderate case for the ellipticity . as can be seen in eq.([eqh0 ] ) , the results here can easily be scaled to other choices for this parameter .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have neglected the deformation introduced by rotation .",
    "if the rotation and magnetic field are weak sufficiently to be treated as a small perturbations to the force balance of the stellar matter ( a back - of - envelope calculation shows that the smallest magnetic field affecting the stellar configuration more seriously is , @xmath60 g ) , the perturbation to @xmath51 can be regarded as a linear superposition of both these two contributions . as long",
    "as the stellar rotation rate is not near to the mass shedding limit , the deformation by rotation only slightly changes the moment of inertia @xmath51 and has a negligible effect on the deformation which is not aligned with the rotation axis and which produces the gravitational radiation .",
    "the timescale of the evolution of the rotational frequency is much longer than the rotational periods of the stars , so that the evolution can be regarded as secular . in this case , the characteristic amplitude of the signal is defined by ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath61 where the frequency @xmath49 is a secularly changing function of time . in fig.[hc ] we plot @xmath62 for several parameters of our model .",
    "the distance to the source is assumed to be @xmath63mpc .",
    "the curves labeled as a#,b#,c # are for the initial rotational frequency @xmath64hz , respectively .",
    "the number after the letters distinguishes the strength of the magnetic field , i.e. , `` 15 '' corresponds to @xmath65 g and `` 14 '' to @xmath66 g .",
    "the total in - falling mass @xmath40 is fixed to be @xmath67 . for comparison ,",
    "the noise curves of several laser interferometric detectors ( ligo , virgo , geo600 ) are also plotted .",
    "for all of the curves apart from ( c15 ) , the curves consist of two parts with increasing and decreasing amplitude @xmath68 ( the lower and the upper branches of the curves respectively ) .",
    "the reason for there sometimes being two values of @xmath68 corresponding to a single value of @xmath49 is that we are here calculating @xmath68 as a function of time ( using eq.(11 ) ) and not integrating over all observed times .    in general , the evolution of the system starts with a phase of increasing stellar rotation frequency , which is followed by a plateau of frequency and then the frequency decreases ( see eg .",
    "the lower panel of fig .  1 ) to begin with , both @xmath68 and @xmath49 increase ; @xmath68 then rises to the maximum value and then decreases again ( with an associated decrease in @xmath49 ) tracing out the upper branch of the curves from right to left .    on the other hand , for ( c15 ) ,",
    "only one branch exists .",
    "this is because in this case , the magnetic field and the initial spin frequency are so high that the propeller mechanism is active all through the evolution . as seen in fig.2 , the frequency decreases monotonically .    for fixed magnetic field",
    ", the upper portion of the curves converges asymptotically to the same line , being independent of the initial rotational frequency @xmath42 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the late phase of evolution of the system is driven by magnetic dipole radiation , which is almost independent of the initial rotational frequency of the star ( cf .",
    "the discussion after the eq.([omegat ] ) ) .    to see the detectability of the sources , the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath69 )",
    "is computed using the formula ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ) ; @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the minimum and the maximum frequencies of the source during the observation and @xmath73 is the noise spectrum of the detector .",
    "we take the approximate formulae for the noise of virgo ( by j.y .",
    "vinet ; http://www.virgo.infn.it/ ) and ligo iii ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ) . in fig.[sn ] , the value of computed @xmath69 is plotted as a function of the initial rotation frequency for a star at a distance of @xmath63mpc .",
    "as expected , the @xmath69 becomes larger with increases of the stellar magnetic field , the total mass of the in - falling matter and the initial rotation frequency of the star . with the parameters adopted here , we conclude that sources at this distance can not be observed by ligo iii or virgo .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the parameter @xmath56 which measures the deformation of the star by the magnetic field is quite uncertain .",
    "we should note again that we have here adopted a moderate choice for this parameter , @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , if this value goes up by one order of magnitude , an initially rapidly rotating ( @xmath74hz ) , highly magnetized ( @xmath75 g ) star can be observed at @xmath76 .",
    "using a simple model , we have computed the evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars with hypercritically in - falling matter just after their birth .",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field would introduce a deformation of the star .",
    "if the axis of deformation were misaligned with the rotation axis , the object would emit gravitational waves with frequencies equal to the rotational one and its overtone .",
    "we have computed the characteristic amplitude of gravitational waves produced in this way .",
    "the results obtained indicate that if a strong magnetic field ( @xmath75 g ) efficiently deforms the star ( @xmath77 ) , we could observe the resulting signal from a source in the virgo cluster , when matched - filtering techniques are used in up - coming detectors .",
    "our model is built on several assumptions .",
    "two of them in particular should be commented on .",
    "firstly , we assume that the accretion flow can be well - described by a simple advection dominated disk . in the present context , the accretion rate is such that an accretion shock is developed far outside the stellar surface ( armitage & livio 2000 ; see eq.(17 ) of brown et al .",
    "internal to the shock , the accretion flow can be again hypercritical .",
    "however , it is possible that the system might have a jet or an explosive outflow to remove the matter in - flowing onto the central objects ( armitage & livio 2000 ) . in that case",
    ", the accretion rate onto the object would be significantly reduced .",
    "at present the mechanism of formation of an outflow from an accretion disk is unknown .",
    "for instance , the standard magnetically driven outflow ( blandford 1976 ; lovelace 1976 ) may not work because the ram pressure of the inflow here is comparable with or exceeding that of the magnetic field of the central star .",
    "secondly we assume that the magnetic field inside and at the surface of the star does not change in the course of the evolution of the system .",
    "the decay of neutron star magnetic fields has been an important but unsolved issue which is related to the observational data for radio pulsars and low mass x - ray binaries ( possenti 1999 ) .",
    "to explain the different strengths of the magnetic field in younger systems ( ordinary radio pulsars ) and older ones ( low mass x - ray binaries or millisecond pulsars ) , some kind of mechanism for field decay seem to be needed .",
    "the accretion driven decay model and the spin driven decay model ( possenti 1999 ) might both be relevant for our model system here although their applicability is not clear since they have much stronger field .",
    "also notice that the time scale of the decay in these scenarios should be much longer than the time scale of the evolution of the system ( see also zanotti & rezzolla 2001 ) .",
