    "in the zoo of the heavy - light @xmath5 mesons , the properties of radially excited @xmath9 and orbitally excited @xmath10 states have been explored for a long time .",

    "its @xmath26 has not been measured or assigned .",
    "the observation of @xmath27 rules out the possibility as a @xmath28 state since a @xmath29 @xmath5 is forbidden to decay into @xmath15 , and this state is supposed to have spin - parity : @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath0 was identified with the first radial excitation of @xmath31  @xcite , or the orbitally excited d - wave @xmath6 @xmath5  @xcite , or the mixture of them  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath32 as the @xmath33 @xmath5  @xcite was ruled out , and @xmath32 is interpreted as the @xmath7 @xmath5  @xcite . however , theoretical interpretations of these states in different assignments are not completely consistent with experiments either on their spectrum or on their decay properties .",
    "where to place these two excited states ? obviously , the observations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and some other resonances  @xcite bring us some puzzles .",
    "the study of the properties of strong decays is believed a good way to identify new observed states .    among models for strong decays ,",
    "the @xmath2 quark - pair - creation model has been employed successfully to evaluate the ozi - allowed strong decays of both mesons and baryons  @xcite .",
    "thorough understanding of the success of the @xmath2 model has also been investigated  @xcite . within the @xmath2 model , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "have been analyzed  @xcite . however , there are different assignments and conclusions to these two states in these references . especially , some theoretical predictions of the branching ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 are not consistent with experiments , and the predicted mixing angle @xmath36 is different from each other . therefore , it would be interesting to study the uncertainties relevant to the interpretations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the @xmath2 model .",
    "it is believed that the p - wave @xmath37 and @xmath5 mesons have been established  @xcite . in the p - wave multiplets of heavy - light mesons",
    ", the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states may mix with each other , so the observed @xmath40 states should be the mixed ones . the mixing scheme has been explored and the mixing angle has been determined in refs .  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the radially excited @xmath4 and the orbitally excited @xmath6 may mix with each other through some mechanism , which is known as the  excited - vector - meson puzzle \"  @xcite .",
    "this mixing will complex our understanding of the higher excited @xmath17 states .",
    "therefore , it will be useful to find out how large the mixing effect on the explanation of the excited states is .",
    "for example , to see whether the theoretical interpretation of the @xmath17 states is mixing scheme dependent or not , or to determine how large the mixing angle is .    in this paper , @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    ", the evaluation of the strong decays widths ( formula in ref .",
    "@xcite is adopted ) involves some parameters : the strength of quark pair creation from the vacuum @xmath44 , the @xmath3 value in the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wave functions and the constituent quark masses .",
    "@xmath44 represents the probability that a quark - antiquark pair is created from the vacuum , and it is supposed as a universal parameter .",
    "all the partial widths are proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath3 in the sho wave function is the harmonic oscillator strength parameter , which can be fixed to reproduce the realistic root mean square radius of the sho wave function .",

    "our investigation indicates that the ways of choices of @xmath3 play an important role in the evaluation of the strong decays .",
