    "the holy grail of quantum information is the realization of a universal quantum computer , capable of solving a variety of tasks , including some that can not be solved efficiently by classical computers .",
    "although progress has been made towards this goal , it remains a daunting task .",
    "a more practical alternative is to develop utility modules capable of specific tasks such as quantum wires for state transfer @xcite or entanglement generation @xcite , which are easier to design and manufacture .",
    "these tasks can be achieved with minimal or no control .",
    "perfect state transfer , for example , can be achieved by propagation along a spin chain with a suitably engineered hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "however , these schemes have obvious drawbacks such as the requirement for precise hamiltonian engineering , and the fact that they are limited to performing a single fixed task .",
    "we would like to relax the constraints slightly and see how much is gained by adding a small amount of control .",
    "do we enlarge the range of tasks that can be achieved and the systems that can be used ?",
    "recent work suggests that it is indeed possible to vastly increase the potential of many systems with very limited control .",
    "control of a single coupling and some local control of the end spins , for example , can be sufficient to efficiently realize a universal quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the problem of realizing quantum information primitives such as state transfer and entanglement generation using a minimal degree of control , and the related task of identifying the key properties of a system such that those control techniques can then be applied , have also been studied , in particular for spin systems .",
    "most studies have focused on special geometries , particularly chains and quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite , dual - chains @xcite and rings @xcite , but there have been some studies more general networks  @xcite .",
    "each of these investigations has proved a certain information processing property , but a general framework for determining the capability of an arbitrary network is still lacking .    in this paper , we propose a unifying framework for describing certain state transformation tasks that involve simultaneously transforming a fixed set of initial states into a fixed set of output states .",
    "this allows us to simultaneously discuss processing tasks such as perfect state transfer and entanglement generation , rather than tackle each case separately .",
    "these tasks require far less than full control of the system , but the ability to perform them is restricted by symmetries of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we discuss the notions of full controllability , and introduce the much weaker notion of sets of accessible pairs , and describe the role of lie algebra symmetries , deriving bounds on the fidelity with which a given state transformation task can be realized based on symmetry properties of the system and control hamiltonians . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we demonstrate how the upper bounds on a state transformation task can be achieved within a large class of spin networks by controlling a single coupling between two spins .",
    "this includes an exact description of one class of symmetries for these systems , a necessary and sufficient condition for their presence being that the underlying network topology should correspond to a bipartite ( two - colorable ) graph . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dark_states ] it is shown how symmetry restrictions can be overcome by catalytic excitations , which emphasizes a marked difference in state transformation capabilities in comparison to the standard assumptions made in the analysis of state transfer in networks .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec:5 ] , we discuss how many of the important parameters for the transfer can be estimated from experimental data if they are not previously known .",
    "among the most elementary concepts in control theory are reachability and controllability . given a controlled dynamical system ,",
    "a state @xmath0 is _ reachable _ from an initial state @xmath1 if there exists a control sequence and some time @xmath2 such that the corresponding trajectory of the system satisfies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the system is _ controllable _ if any state in the state space is reachable from any other state . applied to bilinear control systems evolving on a lie group , one can derive explicit criteria for controllability in terms of the lie algebra formed by the dynamical generators . in particular , this is the case for decoherence - free quantum systems governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a unitary operator on the hilbert space @xmath7 of the system , and @xmath8 is a hamiltonian that depends linearly on a set of ( real - valued ) controls @xmath9 @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the system hamiltonian and the @xmath12 are hamiltonians governing the interaction with time - varying control fields @xmath9 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the generators of the dynamics and they generate the _ dynamical lie algebra _ @xmath15 , which consists of all linear combinations and iterated commutators of these generators . for a system with hilbert space dimension",
    "@xmath16 the generators @xmath14 , @xmath17 , are anti - hermitian matrices and thus can , at most , generate a subalgebra of the lie algebra @xmath18 of anti - hermitian @xmath19 matrices . a necessary and sufficient condition for the system  ( [ eqn : generic_ham ] ) to be fully controllable then is the lie algebra rank condition  @xcite , @xmath20 .",
    "if it is satisfied , then it can be shown that for any sufficiently large @xmath2 , there exists a set of controls @xmath9 such that any desired unitary gate @xmath21 can be realized , i.e. , given any @xmath22 , we have  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a positive time - ordered exponential .",
    "the reachable set @xmath25 , known as the _ dynamical lie group _ is , in this case , the entire unitary group @xmath26 . applied to an @xmath27-qubit system with a control - linear hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : generic_ham ] ) , this implies that the system is fully controllable if and only if @xmath28 , and the corresponding dynamical lie group @xmath29 . in practice",
    ", this condition can be slightly relaxed as we can usually neglect the global phase of the system , in which case @xmath30 suffices , where @xmath31 is the lie algebra of trace - zero anti - hermitian @xmath19 matrices . in this paper",
    "we consider systems which are not fully controllable , for which @xmath15 need not be @xmath18 or @xmath31 .      the main task in which we are interested throughout this paper is whether a system described by eqn .  ( [ eqn : generic_ham ] ) can be caused to transform its initial state @xmath32 into a given target state @xmath33 through suitable manipulations of the control fields @xmath9 .",
    "if this is the case , we say @xmath34 is an _ accessible pair _ of the system .",
    "if a given pair is not accessible then we quantify how well the system can achieve the desired transformation by calculating the fidelity of the optimal output state @xmath35 , @xmath36 accessible pairs have @xmath37 , whereas a state is dark with respect to a given input if @xmath38 .",
    "one can extend this concept to sets of accessible pairs .",
    "we say a system has a set of ( simultaneously ) accessible pairs @xmath39 if the state @xmath40 can be transformed into @xmath41 by some set of manipulations , and the same set of manipulations , in the same time , also transforms @xmath42 into @xmath43 .    this formalism provides a simple way for describing state transfer .",
    "consider two nodes of a network @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "state transfer from @xmath44 to @xmath45 can be achieved if @xmath46 are accessible pairs for any arbitrary states @xmath47 and @xmath48 as it implies @xmath49 for any superposition @xmath50 ( in this paper , we will only consider the decoherence - free case , which permits us to use linearity of the transformation task ) .",
    "previous studies have focused almost exclusively on systems with excitation - preserving hamiltonians because this vastly simplifies the task . as @xmath51 is an eigenstate of such a system",
    ", setting @xmath52 shows that we simply require that the system has an accessible pair @xmath53 .",
    "we also mention that if we have an initial state @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an ancilla qubit not part of the system , then the same accessible set as for state transfer allows the entanglement to be distributed between @xmath55 and @xmath45 , @xmath56 .",
    "the concept of accessible pairs is a very weak property compared to full controllability .",
    "it requires only that we can implement _ one _ unitary operator that simultaneously maps the input states @xmath57 to the target states @xmath58 , as opposed to an _ arbitrary _ unitary operator . in the example above , this means we only need to generate one unitary operator @xmath59 that maps @xmath60 to @xmath61 to swap the quantum states of the first and last qubit .",
    "a one - dimensional lie algebra may suffice for these purposes @xcite .",
    "the most important reason for lack of full controllability of a control system on a lie group are symmetries restricting the dynamical lie algebra and dynamical lie group .",
    "the relation between symmetries in the hamiltonian of the system , irreducibility and loss of full control has been studied in recent papers by polack _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and sander _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "lie algebra symmetries can be classified in various ways .",
    "we shall distinguish between symmetries that imply reducibility of the dynamical lie algebra and other symmetries .",
    "a dynamic lie algebra @xmath15 is said to be _",
    "reducible _ if it can be written as the direct sum of simple lie algebras , e.g. , @xmath62 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for reducibility of @xmath15 is the existence of a non - trivial hermitian symmetry operator @xmath63 that commutes with every element of @xmath15 , @xmath64 = 0 , \\quad \\forall\\ : m=0,1,2,\\ldots.\\ ] ] we shall refer to such @xmath63 as _ commuting symmetry operators _ ( csos ) .",
    "the commutation relations imply that the hamiltonians leave non - trivial subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath7 invariant , and thus there exists a basis with respect to which @xmath63 and all @xmath12 have the same non - trivial block - diagonal structure , and we can write the hilbert space @xmath7 as a direct sum of mutually invariant subspaces @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of independent blocks .",
    "every @xmath12 has an eigenvector decomposition such that every eigenvector can be written as a linear superposition of the eigenvectors of @xmath63 drawn from a given degenerate eigenspace .",
    "the evolution on each subspace is described by its own hamiltonian and thus the projection of a state onto each subspace , @xmath67 , is a constant of motion .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for a system to have an accessible pair @xmath34 is that the initial state @xmath32 and target state @xmath33 have the same projections onto each invariant subspace .",
    "an important subclass of csos are the _ permutation symmetries _ , corresponding to the interchange of indistinguishable physical qubits of the @xmath27-qubit system .",
    "this particular subclass was referred to as an outer symmetry in @xcite .",
    "a general procedure to find cso is described in appendix  [ appendix : a ] .",
    "irreducibility of the lie algebra on an @xmath16-dimensional subspace @xmath68 alone , however , is insufficient to ensure full controllability on this subspace . assuming the hamiltonians @xmath12 are traceless , which can be achieved by subtracting a multiple of the identity if necessary , all irreducible components of the lie algebra",
    "must be simple subalgebras of @xmath31 , which restricts to candidates of the form @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( for some @xmath72 ) or one of the exceptional lie algebras . in this case , although we can always produce a unitary evolution that takes an initial state to a final state with a non - zero overlap with our target state , we may not be able to produce arbitrarily high overlap with the target  @xcite . for a subspace of dimension @xmath16",
    "this occurs precisely when the dynamical lie algebra is neither @xmath31 nor @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "* example 1 : * a simple example is a system with @xmath74 the lie algebra generated by @xmath75 is a unitary representation of @xmath76 and indecomposable , but the system possesses an orthogonal symmetry ; both matrices anticommute with @xmath77 let us define the basis to be @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath78 are the eigenvectors of @xmath11 with eigenvalues @xmath80 respectively .",
    "@xmath81 couples the state @xmath79 equally to the states @xmath78 , which are not directly coupled .",
    "imagine we start from the state @xmath79 and wish to produce a state @xmath82 .",
    "the symmetry prevents us from perfectly producing @xmath82 unless @xmath83 to see this , consider the unitary basis change @xmath84 which maps the generators @xmath13 and @xmath85 onto real skew - symmetric matrices .",
    "hence the evolution under any control sequence @xmath86 must be described by a unitary matrix which is real .",
    "since @xmath87 is a real vector ( up to a global phase ) , the output @xmath88 must be a real vector @xmath89 .",
    "hence , inverting @xmath45 shows that we have @xmath90 which , because each of the coefficients is real , have equal magnitudes of amplitude .",
    "thus , given a maximal decomposition of the hilbert space and lie algebra into irreducible subalgebras , the next step is to identify symmetries such as orthogonal or symplectic symmetries , which are characterized by the existence of an orthogonal or symplectic symmetry operator @xmath63 such that every element @xmath91 in the irreducible lie algebra @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 if all the dynamic generators of the system are of the form @xmath94 , where @xmath12 are real - symmetric matrices , then @xmath95 simplifies to the anticommutation relation @xmath96 and we shall therefore refer to such @xmath63 as _ anticommuting symmetry operators _ ( asos ) .",
    "given the hamiltonians @xmath12 , such symmetries can easily be determined , as described in appendix  [ appendix : a ] .",
    "a given system may have several csos that do not commute with each other , meaning that block - diagonal structures are not simultaneously realizable .",
    "we will always choose to analyze the symmetries that are most natural for the problem at hand , but one might worry that other non - commuting symmetries , be they csos or asos , could come into play .",
    "we will briefly justify that they do not , and therefore once we have picked a set of csos , we only have to find other csos or asos that act on the reduced space .",
    "imagine that we have found a cso such that the system hamiltonian and the control hamiltonians all decompose into the same subspace structure , @xmath97 and that our initial state only has support on @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , the evolution of that initial state is only determined by hamiltonians restricted to @xmath98 ; it does not matter what the hamiltonians are on the complement to that space .",
    "so , let s say we have now found an @xmath99 which could either be a cso or aso , but does not respect the subspace structure i.e.  it couples between the two .",
    "the existence of this @xmath99 must depend heavily on the structure of the hamiltonians on the complement space  if they were different , @xmath99 would not exist , and then it certainly could nt restrict the dynamics within @xmath98 . since we ve argued , however , that our evolution of a state supported on @xmath98 should not be affected by changing the hamiltonians on the complement space , it must be that @xmath99 does not affect the dynamics .",
    "combining the knowledge of how the system hamiltonian decomposes under basis change with the knowledge of the symmetries satisfied by each subsystem allows us to characterize what properties of the system s population are conserved under controlled evolution .",
    "this information can be used to calculate the maximum achievable overlap of an initial state with a target state as a measure of a network s suitability for certain information transmission and state preparation tasks .",
    "first , let @xmath100 be an orthonormal set of input states ( we will typically take these to be determined by the subspace structure induced by the csos ) , which we can use to decompose the input state @xmath101 now suppose we can implement a particular unitary operator @xmath59 that maps this set to a set of output states @xmath102 . expressing the target state in this basis , we have @xmath103 whereas @xmath59",
    "can only transform @xmath104 to @xmath105 giving a maximum overlap with the target state of @xmath106 if @xmath25 is the dynamical lie group of the system , @xmath15 being its dynamical lie algebra , then the maximum transfer fidelity is @xmath107 the latter expression is not easy to evaluate in general , but we can give upper bounds based on our knowledge of the symmetries of the system .",
    "for example , suppose we know that the system decomposes due to the presence of csos , i.e. , @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and the dynamics on each subspace @xmath111 are independent .",
    "we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 are the respective ( normalized ) projections onto the subspaces .",
    "as any vector in the subspace @xmath111 must remain in this subspace and the norm is preserved under unitary evolution , the best we can hope for is to simultaneously map the normalized states @xmath117 onto @xmath118 for all @xmath119 , in which case we obtain @xmath120 which is equivalent to ( [ eqn : maxfid ] ) .",
    "this bound is guaranteed to be attainable only if all the relative phases between subspaces can be controlled , i.e. , if the dynamical lie algebras on the subspaces are @xmath121 or @xmath122 . in practice , if the subspace hamiltonians have zero trace then we do not have ( subspace ) phase controllability , and the most we can actually hope for is to map each @xmath117 to a state @xmath123 , in which case we obtain the modified bound @xmath124 and the original bound may be unattainable . similarly",
    ", this may be the case if the subspace dynamics is constrained by further asos .",
    "nonetheless the bound is often attainable for certain initial and target states even in spite of these symmetries and phase constraints .",
    "to demonstrate some of these concepts , we take the well - known class of examples as defined by the @xmath125-coupled @xmath27-spin networks .    define a graph @xmath126 of the spin network , where @xmath127 is the vertex set ( of @xmath27 elements ) of physical qubits and the edge set @xmath128 .",
    "the system hamiltonian for the spin network is thus @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the standard pauli matrices and @xmath133 are real - valued coupling constants .",
    "the hamiltonians are therefore given by real - symmetric matrices .",
    "we can similarly add control to the network by modifying a subset of the couplings defined by the edge set of a second graph , @xmath134 @xmath135 the controlled coupling can be manipulated either by a simple on - off sequence or more complicated pulses .",
    "it can easily be shown that the system hamiltonian commutes with the total spin operator : @xmath136=0 $ ] for @xmath137 and thus the number of excitations in the system is preserved , i.e. , the dynamic lie algebra is a direct sum of @xmath27 subalgebras , each corresponding to the evolution of @xmath138 excitations along the chain .",
    "the control @xmath139 also preserves the coupling isotropy in the @xmath140-plane and thus also commutes with the total spin operator , @xmath141=0 $ ] , preserving the decomposition into excitation subspaces .",
    "the system is therefore not controllable in a conventional sense and would be unsuitable for @xmath27-qubit quantum computation without the addition of some control that does not commute with @xmath142 in order to break this symmetry and couple the sub - blocks of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , for information transfer and state manipulations , excitation preservation is a positive property to exploit , automatically confining the dispersion of the excitation(s ) within a lower - dimensional subspace .",
    "this will allow us to show how a single excitation can be forced to propagate to a chosen target state of the network .    within the first excitation subspace",
    ", we use the basis @xmath143 to denote an excitation localized on the @xmath144 qubit .",
    "similarly , in the second excitation subspace we use @xmath145 to denote a pair of excitations on qubits @xmath16 and @xmath146 . in a slight abuse of this notation , given a state @xmath147",
    ", we will write @xmath148 to denote @xmath149 .    we shall use the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath150 to denote the restriction of @xmath11 and @xmath139 to the single excitation subspace .",
    "@xmath44 is an @xmath151 matrix with elements @xmath152 for any pair @xmath153 which constitutes an edge of the underlying graph ( and similarly for @xmath150 using @xmath154 instead ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall take @xmath155 . if all @xmath156 , then @xmath44 corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the graph @xmath157 .",
    "note that all diagonal elements of both matrices are zero .",
    "although the following analysis could be conducted for more general controlling interactions , in the spirit of analyzing the capabilities of systems with minimalistic control , we consider controlling interactions of _ pendant _ type , i.e.  in graph @xmath157 , vertex 1 is unconnected ( meaning @xmath158 for all @xmath159 ) , whereas the only edge in @xmath160 is between vertices 1 and 2 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can take @xmath161 , corresponding to a control hamiltonian @xmath162 in the first instance , we assume that the coupling strengths are all known .",
    "we first prepare the network in the zero - excitation state using a suitably strong background magnetic field  , and initialize a state transfer or a single excitation state preparation task by introducing a single excitation on the pendant qubit . given the initial state @xmath79 on the pendant qubit and a target state @xmath48 in the single excitation subspace , what is the optimal fidelity that can be achieved through modulation of the control @xmath150 ?",
    "we start by applying the symmetry conditions to the particular case of a pendant controlled spin network , restricted to the first excitation subspace .",
    "let @xmath99 be a symmetry operator of the system .",
    "then @xmath163 where the sign determines whether the symmetry is of aso or cso type and must take the same value for both equations .",
    "if @xmath99 is a cso , then @xmath79 must be an eigenstate of @xmath99 .",
    "also , the eigenvectors of @xmath150 , @xmath164 must be eigenstates of @xmath99 . combining these statements",
    ", @xmath165 is an eigenstate of @xmath99 , and this is in the same eigenspace as @xmath79 .",
    "any eigenstate of @xmath44 that is in a different eigenspace of @xmath99 must satisfy @xmath166 , and can not be accessed .",
    "this allows us to show that degeneracies of the system are necessarily associated with symmetries .",
    "if @xmath44 has degenerate eigenvalues then we have an eigendecomposition @xmath167 , where @xmath168 are projectors onto the respective eigenspaces , and we have either @xmath169 , in which case there is no overlap of state @xmath170 with the @xmath171th eigenspace , or we can define an eigenbasis such that @xmath172 . as the projection of a vector onto a subspace can not have more than rank @xmath173 ,",
    "all other eigenvectors @xmath174 in the @xmath171th eigenspace must have zero overlap with state @xmath165 , and thus each @xmath175 for @xmath176 commutes with both @xmath44 and @xmath150 and is therefore a cso .",
    "this means that when we work under the assumption of having found all csos , we can take the subspaces to be non - degenerate .",
    "henceforth , we shall use @xmath177 to denote the smallest subspace with support on @xmath165 , i.e.  the space that remains relevant for tasks state manipulation tasks where we start in the state @xmath79 when we remove all the csos from the single excitation subspace .",
    "now we wish to identify the asos on @xmath177 , as these are the only ones that could affect our state manipulation task , potentially reducing the achievable fidelity below that of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : maxfid2 ] ) .    in a pendant - controlled system with the pendant qubit indexed as qubit 1 ,",
    "if @xmath157 is a graph which is connected on vertices @xmath178 to @xmath27 with positive weights , @xmath155 , a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an aso that applies to @xmath177 is that @xmath157 is bipartite ( two - colorable ) .",
    "we start by noting that if @xmath179 is bipartite , we can easily give an aso within the single excitation subspace . for a graph to be bipartite ,",
    "it means that we can partition the vertices into two sets @xmath180 such that edges only connect between the sets , not within a set .",
    "if we apply a product of @xmath132 operations on one side of that bipartition , then every @xmath181 coupling is affected by exactly one @xmath132 operator , with which it anticommutes .",
    "hence , this is an aso , and applies in all excitation subspaces .    in case",
    "there are additional csos that apply within the single excitation subspace , we need to justify that this aso will also apply to just @xmath177 .",
    "let @xmath99 be the matrix representing the aso in the single excitation subspace .",
    "we can write it as the diagonal matrix @xmath182 as with all asos , @xmath99 imposes that the eigenvectors of @xmath44 , @xmath183 either have 0 eigenvalue or arise in @xmath184 pairs with the eigenvector of eigenvalue @xmath185 being given by @xmath186 .",
    "this is proven by using the anticommutation ,",
    "@xmath187 now let s imagine there s another cso that applies to both @xmath44 and @xmath150 .",

    "if @xmath188 , then is also holds that @xmath189 , so for any @xmath190 , eigenvectors can be removed in pairs .",
    "these pairs manifest within @xmath44 or @xmath150 as a subspace @xmath191 since @xmath192 , we have that @xmath193 on the other hand , if @xmath194 , then we just have @xmath195 , and thus @xmath196 so , for each subspace that we remove , the matrix @xmath99 splits into two components , an aso for the removed subspace , and an aso for the remaining one .",
    "if @xmath99 were to remain diagonal under the action of that unitary , then @xmath99 would also have the same subspace structure , and we could just extract that @xmath177 component . if we are removing an eigenvector @xmath183 from the space , then it is because it has @xmath188 , which will also be true for the eigenvector @xmath186 i.e.  for non - zero eigenvalues , the eigenvectors must be removed in pairs .    moreover , it is the only relevant aso in the single excitation subspace .    having taken into account all csos , @xmath197 for a pendant - controlled system has no more than one aso .",
    "we can take the restriction of @xmath150 to @xmath198 to be @xmath199 , and the restriction of @xmath44 to @xmath198 is @xmath55 , which has @xmath200 eigenvectors @xmath183 .",
    "we can always take that @xmath201 , which is a 0 value eigenvector of @xmath55 .",
    "assume there exists an @xmath99 which anticommutes with both @xmath150 and @xmath55 .",
    "anticommutation with @xmath150 means the structure of @xmath99 must be such that @xmath79 and @xmath165 are eigenvectors with eigenvalues of equal magnitude but opposite sign .",

    "anticommutation with @xmath55 implies that eigenvectors come in @xmath184 pairs , with a single 0 eigenvector if @xmath200 is even .",
