    "the top - pair forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron collider by the cdf collaboration @xcite has generated much interest @xcite as a possible harbinger of new physics . at lowest order in the sm ,",
    "the top - pair production is symmetric under charge conjugation .",
    "a small forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath12 @xcite in the @xmath13 rest - frame arises through the interference of nlo qcd processes that differ under charge conjugation .",
    "recent results from the cdf collaboration @xcite using a data set of 5.3 fb@xmath14 show that the forward - backward asymmetry in top pair production @xmath15 still deviates from sm predictions and , furthermore , is mass - dependent .",
    "in particular , the asymmetry is most prominent in regions of high rapidity difference @xmath16 and large invariant mass @xmath17 gev , where there are @xmath18 and @xmath19 deviations , respectively , from nlo predictions .",
    "such a distribution is a generic feature in the @xmath20-channel exchange of a particle @xcite @xcite @xcite@xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we proposed an asymmetric left - right model ( alrm ) based on the gauge symmetry @xmath2 .",
    "this model has electroweak @xmath3 and @xmath5 bosons in addition to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the sm . in that work",
    ", we did not assume a specific higgs mechanism , but treated the @xmath3 and @xmath5 masses to be independent parameters .",
    "in the present paper , we assume that the primed gauge group is broken by the neutral member of a triplet higgs sector by a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath23 .",
    "the sm electroweak gauge group is broken as usual by the vev @xmath24 of the neutral member of the sm higgs doublet . in the alrm ,",
    "the @xmath3 boson has a @xmath4 right - handed coupling with coupling @xmath25 and the @xmath5 boson has diagonal fermion couplings .",
    "we determine the model parameters from the cdf data to be @xmath26 gev , @xmath7 tev , and @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath5 total decay widths are then of @xmath27    we begin with an overview of the alrm and then discuss the symmetry breaking in section ii . in section iii , we calculate the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath15 as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath28 and compare our results with the cdf data . in section iv , we evaluate signals of the alrm at the lhc . the signals at the lhc from @xmath29 production and their @xmath10 , @xmath11 decays can definitively test this model interpretation of the cdf top asymmetry data .",
    "we end with our conclusions in section v.",
    "the alrm begins with the gauge group @xmath2 . the unprimed @xmath30 acts on the usual sm left - handed quark doublets .",
    "the primed @xmath31 applies to the right - handed doublet @xmath32 in an unconventional grouping .",
    "the gauge symmetries are broken sequentially , starting with @xmath33 to obtain the sm hypercharge @xmath34 , and then @xmath35 to obtain @xmath36 . by using this sequential approximation to the breaking",
    ", we preserve the sm interaction .    after symmetry breaking , there are massive @xmath5 and @xmath37 bosons in addition to the usual weak bosons .",
    "the @xmath38 have a @xmath39 tri - gauge boson coupling given by @xmath40 , which is of order @xmath41 . in order to preserve unitarity",
    ", the sm @xmath22 also appears in the vertex @xmath42 with coupling @xmath43 .",
    "additional massive fermions will be needed for anomaly cancellation .",
    "our results are derived by making two successive rotations of gauge boson states .",
    "first , we make the rotation @xmath44 then the couplings to the generators become @xmath45 subsequently , we perform the usual sm rotation from the basis of @xmath46 to the basis of @xmath47 . to simplify the expressions , we denote @xmath48 .",
    "the sm hypercharge coupling is @xmath49 , and the sm @xmath30 coupling is @xmath50 .",
    "it is also useful to note that @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that the higgs mechanism is due to the condensate of a primed higgs triplet with @xmath53 , which is denoted as @xmath54 with its vev as @xmath55 .",
    "using a higgs triplet allows for a larger mass gap between the @xmath5 and @xmath3 bosons than a higgs doublet .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 and @xmath57 the two - stage approximation is justified by @xmath58 .",
    "thus , @xmath59    a search by cdf in the muon - pair channel established a lower bound of @xmath60 gev for a @xmath5 with sm couplings @xcite .",
    "dijet searches have placed exclusion limits of @xmath61 gev , again with sm coupling of the @xmath5 @xcite . for our @xmath5 , with @xmath8 , the dimuon limit is @xmath62 gev while the dijets do not limit @xmath63 .",
