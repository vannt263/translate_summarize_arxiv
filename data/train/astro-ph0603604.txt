    "all derived various values for the gas densities and temperatures across the photon - dominated region ( pdr ) that exists along this edge of the nebula .",
    "abergel et al . ( 2003 ) confirmed that the star @xmath9 orionis is responsible for the ionising radiation producing the pdr .",

    "they compared the nebula to the now equally famous eagle nebula with its ` pillars ' of gas and dust .",
    "they deduced that the two nebulae were formed in a somewhat similar fashion , by the action of nearby massive stars and their associated hii regions , either by an instability or an ionisation front .",
    "williams , ward - thompson & whitworth ( 2001 ) argued that the formation of such ` pillars ' or ` columns ' of dust and gas is probably a fairly common phenomenon in star formation .",
    "( 80,85 ) ( 0,0 )    one difference between the eagle nebula and the horsehead nebula is that whereas dense condensations have been known for some time to exist in the pillars of the eagle nebula ( e.g. white et al .",
    "1999 ) , until recently no similar condensations were known in the horsehead nebula .",
    "these dense condensations are the likely progenitors of the next generation of star formation and may give clues as to the initial conditions for star formation in such regions .",
    "studies of these dense clumps may therefore provide indicators that will allow us to differentiate between the various models of ` triggered ' and ` spontaneous ' star formation ( e.g. ward - thompson et al .",

    "fitting two - component gaussians to the calibrator source showed there to be a negligible error beam at 850  @xmath0 m , but at 450 @xmath0 m a significant error beam was detected that was found to contribute up to 10% of the flux density .",
    "this was taken into account in calibrating the data by using identical apertures when determining the calibration on the planet mars and measuring the flux densities of the sources . in the final maps it was found that the average 1@xmath9 noise ( off - source ) was 17 mjy / beam at 850 @xmath0 m and 110 mjy / beam at 450 @xmath0 m .",

    "we can calculate the mass of gas and dust responsible for emission in our two submillimetre sources from the 850-@xmath0 m flux densities , using various assumptions , provided we know the temperature of the emitting dust .",

    "1996 ; ward - thompson , motte & andr 1999 ; and andr , ward - thompson & barsony 1993 ; for detailed justifications both of this value of @xmath20 in particular and this method of obtaining masses in general ) . the uncertainties in the masses due to a combination of uncertainties in @xmath26 could be as high as a factor of a few ( see andr et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "for smm1 we have a range of temperatures which we could adopt , as discussed above , given that there is probably a temperature gradient across the source .",
    "as stated above , habart et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found in their model that a mean density of 2 @xmath3 10@xmath10 @xmath5 yields a temperature of 22  k , while a mean density of 2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 gives a temperature of 13.5  k. at these temperatures , the masses derived from submillimetre continuum data are very sensitive to temperature , due to the exponential nature of the planck function .",
    "adopting a temperature of 22  k gives us a mass for smm1 of @xmath12  m@xmath2 , while a temperature of 13.5  k gives a mass of @xmath14  m@xmath2 .",
    "we can check for internal consistency by calculating a mean density for smm1 based on each of these mases in turn . to do this",
    "we need to assume the line - of - sight dimension of smm1 .",
    "abergel et al . ( 2003 ) treat it as an edge - on plane , whilst habart et al .",
    "( 2005 ) opt for something that is in fact prolate and filamentary in nature .",
    "hence , we take the average of the two and assume that the line - of - sight thickness of smm1 is the mean of its other two dimensions",
    ". then a mass of 2  m@xmath2 ( @xmath23=22k ) yields a mean volume number density of n(h@xmath11 ) @xmath11 @xmath3 10@xmath10 @xmath5 , and a mass of 4  m@xmath2 ( @xmath23=13.5k ) yields a mean volume number density of n(h@xmath11 ) @xmath12 @xmath3 10@xmath10 @xmath5 .",
    "hence we see that a temperature of 13.5  k and a mass of 4  m@xmath2 , yields a mean volume density of 2 @xmath3 10@xmath10 @xmath5 , compared to the 2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 used by the model to calculate the temperature of 13.5  k in the first place .",
    "thus this assumption does not yield a self - consistent result .",
    "we note that our line - of - sight assumption only alters these numbers by a factor of @xmath12 , rather than the order - of - magnitude required .    on the other hand",
    ", we see that a temperature of 22  k and a mass of 2  m@xmath2 , yields a mean volume density of 1 @xmath3 10@xmath10 @xmath5 , which is about equal to the mean density used by habart et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to calculate the kinetic temperature of 22  k in the first place , and the calculation is self - consistent .",
    "this is also consistent with the mean volume density derived by abergel et al .",
    "thus the whole derivation is self - consistent and consistent with previous work , so these are the values we adopt for smm1 , and we list them in table 2 . we note that johnstone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) assume a bonnor - ebert form for this source and find a temperature of 19  k , in reasonable agreement with our adopted value .",
    "we also note that the uncertainties on these numbers could therefore be a factor of order a few , so we only quote masses and densities to one significant figure .",
    "the mean column density we derive for the molecular cloud associated with smm1 is 4 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath8 , which is somewhat higher than the values derived by abergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from their co data .",
    "however , these latter authors noted that their derived column density was clearly a lower limit , and only valid for the cloud edge , since they acknowledged that their co data were almost certainly optically thick in the cloud core .",
    "the peak column density we derive is a factor of 10 higher than the mean column density , and corresponds to the densest part of smm1 .",
    "the peak volume density we derive is 6 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , although we note a larger uncertainty in this number due to the unknown line - of - sight depth of the dense peak region ( once again we have assumed that the line - of - sight dimension of the source is the mean of its other two dimensions ) .",
    "nonetheless , this is comparable to the densities seen in pre - stellar cores ( kirk et al . 2005 ) , which are dense cores on their way to forming stars ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "hence smm1 may be pre - stellar in nature , and we discuss this possibility in section 5 below .      the source that we refer to as b33-smm2 has been detected before at a wavelength of 1.2  mm ( teyssier et al . 2004 ; habart et al . 2005 ) , and also at 850  @xmath0 m ( johnstone et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , most authors have not paid it much attention .",
    "it can also be seen as a minor peak in the co(3 - 2 ) data ( habart et al .",
    "2005 ) , although again these authors concentrated primarily on the pdr rather than other structure in the maps .",
    "hily - blant et al .",
    "( 2005 ) labelled a nearby co source as ` peak 2 ' in their data , as mentioned in section 2 above , but it is not clear that these are physically the same source , due to this offset .    there is no shorter wavelength emission detected from smm2 than our 450-@xmath0 m data in figure 3 .",
    "in this regard , it is similar to a pre - stellar core ( ward - thompson et al . 1994 ) or a class 0 protostar ( andr et al . 1993 ) .",
    "however , the lack of any known outflow emission from this region appears to rule out the latter scenario .",
    "we can calculate the physical parameters of smm2 in a similar manner to those we calculated for smm1 .",
    "however , once again a large source of uncertainty is the dust temperature t within the source .",
    "we note that in projection it is significantly further from the hii region than smm1 and is most probably shielded by the bulk of the b33 molecular cloud , including smm1",
    ". therefore smm2 must be cooler than smm1 , although no previous temperature has been derived for it , since all molecular line tracers so far observed either do not detect it , or are depleted or optically thick in this sight - line .",
    "hence the 22  k we adopt for smm1 is clearly too high for smm2 .",
    "we noted above the similarity of smm2 to pre - stellar cores in its extent and appearance ( kirk et al .",
    "pre - stellar cores have typical temperatures around 10  k ( ward - thompson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , we note that none of the cores in this latter study were in the orion region .",
    "most were in taurus or ophiuchus , which are more quiescent regions , and thus 10  k may be too low for smm2 .",
    "so we have a range of possible temperatures of @xmath11020  k. therefore we adopt a temperature of 15  k for smm2 , with an error - bar of 5  k. johnstone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used a bonnor - ebert fit to smm2 and found a temperature of 16  k , in good agreement with our chosen value .",
    "we note that if the temperature were 20  k the derived mass and densities would decrease by a factor of 2 , and if the temperature were 10  k the mass and densities would increase by a factor of 1.75 .",
    "we derive a mass of 4  m@xmath2 for smm2 , based on this temperature . given that smm2 is smaller in extent than smm1 , but with higher mass , it is also therefore more dense .",
    "the mean column density is an order of magnitude higher than smm1 , as is the mean volume density .",
    "note that this difference in densities between smm1 & 2 can not be accounted for simply by our choice of temperatures for the cores  this can account for at most a factor of 2 rather than an order of magnitude .",
    "the peak volume and column densities are also seen to be a factor of @xmath123 higher in smm2 than smm1 .    however , our calculated mean column density of smm2 is in very good agreement with the 3.5 @xmath3 10@xmath7 @xmath5 derived for ` peak 2 ' by hily - blant et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , indicating that their peak 2 may in fact be associated with the extended emission from smm2 .",
    "we note that to calculate the mean volume density we have again assumed that the line - of - sight dimension is the mean of the other two .",
    "hily - blant et al .",
    "( 2005 ) assumed a cylindrical geometry and found a mean volume density roughly a factor of 2 lower .",
    "but they do not see the high peak values in their c@xmath28o data that we see in the dust continuum .",
    "if peak 2 and smm2 are the same , then this may be due to optical depth effects in the co data , or to gas depletion onto grains at the highest densities , as they surmised .",
    "we have an independent method of checking our column density estimate for smm2 , since as we showed in figure  5 above , smm2 is seen as an absorption dip against the bright background emission of l1630 in the mid - infrared data ( c.f . figure  2 of abergel et al . 2003 ) . from this",
    "we can measure the depth of the absorption at 6.75 and 15  @xmath0 m , and hence calculate the peak column density of smm2 , following the method of bacmann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    in this method one compares the intensity of the emission measured at some position in the general cloud emission that is away from the core , @xmath29 , with the intensity of the emission measured on the core , @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath29 is made up of the sum of the background emission intensity , @xmath31 , from the illuminating source behind the dense core  in this case from l1630 ( pound et al .",
    "2003 )  and the widespread general foreground emission intensity , @xmath32 , that includes zodiacal emission and general galactic emission on scales larger than the cloud in question .",
    "@xmath30 is then simply the sum of the foreground emission intensity and the attenuated background emission intensity ( bacmann et al . 2000 ) .",
    "so we have    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the optical depth at wavelength @xmath21 . rearranging for @xmath35 ,",
    "gives :    @xmath36    and we estimate @xmath32 on a region of the data away from the l1630 cloud emission . there is some uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath32 , since it may vary slightly from one part of the map to another , and this may be our chief source of measurement error .",
    "we attempted to estimate this by looking at the maximum variation in intensity across the cloud itself , as well as on regions away from the cloud , and used this to calculate our errors .",
    "the optical depth can be converted into a column density via the dust opacity @xmath37 , using @xmath38 .",
    "we used @xmath39 = 1.2 @xmath3 10@xmath40 @xmath24 and @xmath41 = 1.6 @xmath3 10@xmath40 @xmath24 ( bacmann et al . 2000 ) .    for the 6.75-@xmath0 m data we measured @xmath29 = 18 @xmath12 0.3 mjy / sr , @xmath30 = 9.8 @xmath12 0.1 mjy / sr and @xmath32 = 5.5 @xmath12 0.2 mjy / sr , yielding @xmath42 = 1.07 @xmath12 0.11 . for the 15-@xmath0 m data we measured @xmath29 = 36 @xmath12 0.5 mjy / sr , @xmath30 = 27.5 @xmath12 0.1 mjy / sr and @xmath32 = 25 @xmath12 0.5 mjy / sr , yielding @xmath43 = 1.48 @xmath12 0.34 .",
    "therefore the 6.75-@xmath0 m data give n(h@xmath11 ) = 8.9 @xmath12 0.9 @xmath3 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , and the 15-@xmath0 m data give n(h@xmath11 ) = 9.3 @xmath12 2.1 @xmath3 10@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "both estimates are in excellent agreement with our value of peak column density for smm2 in table 2 of n(h@xmath11 ) = 9 @xmath3 10@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "we note that no temperature estimate is required in this calculation .",
    "this gives us added confidence in the parameters for smm2 that we have calculated from the submillimetre data .",
    "( 80,95 ) ( 0,0 )    we can compare the 850- and 450-@xmath0 m data by calculating the ratio of the emission at these two wavelengths .",
    "figure 6 shows a ratio map of the data .",
    "this was made by first smoothing the 850-@xmath0 m data with 450-@xmath0 m beam , and simultaneously smoothing the 450-@xmath0 m data with the 850-@xmath0 m beam , then subtracting the background level from each map and dividing one by the other ( after making a cut in the data to remove low signal - to - noise regions of each map ) .",
    "it can be seen that the dust outside of the clumps smm1 & 2 ( that can be seen at high enough signal - to - noise ) has a ratio of 0.10.2 in this image .",
    "higher values are seen towards the cores of smm1 & 2 .",
    "this is indicating a different spectral energy distribution for the two embedded sources relative to the less dense cloud .",
    "in addition there is a difference between the two cores , such that the majority of smm1 has a ratio of 0.3 , while the majority of smm2 has a ratio of 0.2 .    the submillimetre spectral index @xmath44 is usually defined as :    @xmath45    where s@xmath46 and s@xmath47 are the flux densities at 450 and 850  @xmath0 m respectively , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the frequencies at these wavelengths .",
    "a ratio of 0.1 in figure 6 corresponds to a submillimetre spectral index @xmath44 of 3.6 , while 0.2 corresponds to @xmath44 of 2.6 , and a ratio of 0.3 corresponds to @xmath44 of 1.9 .",
    "values usually observed for dust in molecular clouds range from @xmath12 to @xmath14 , as we see here .",
    "hence we see that the dense sources have a lower value of @xmath44 than the rest of the nebula .",
    "this could be caused by a lower temperature in the dense cores relative to the surrounding lower density cloud , such as is seen elsewhere in dense cores ( ward - thompson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a marked difference between smm1 & 2 , with the former having a lower value for @xmath44 .",
    "this can not be explained by temperature effects since smm1 is warmer than smm2 ( see section 3 above ) .",
    "it must be due to different dust properties in the two cores .",
    "recent work ( boudet et al . 2005 ) has shown that in the submillimetre regime there is an anti - correlation between the spectral index and the temperature , such that lower spectral indices are seen at higher temperatures .",
    "this work was based on studies carried out of the optical properties of amorphous silicate grains , but is in agreement with observations taken by the programme national dobservations submillimetrique ( pronaos ) ballon - borne experiment ( lamarre et al .",
    "1994 ; lamarre & giard 2002 ) .",
    "the variation of the spectral index seen by pronaos ( dupac et al .",
    "2003 ) was ascribed to variations in the optical properties of amorphous silicate grains in different environments in the inter - stellar medium ( boudet et al .",
    "an alternative explanation in terms of dust grain coagulation was proposed by stepnik et al .",
    "we are possibly seeing one of these effects here .",
    "the horsehead nebula is somewhat reminiscent of the eagle nebula in appearance . in both cases columns of dense gas and dust ` point ' towards hii regions where",
    "massive star formation has taken place . in the case of the eagle nebula ,",
    "dense clumps are seen at the tips of the columns ( white et al .",
    "for the horsehead nebula there is a dense region , smm1 , at the tip of the column ( e.g. abergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and we see that there is another dense clump further ` down ' the column , smm2 , apparently further from the ionising radiation of the newly - formed massive stars .",
    "we now discuss the possible formation mechanisms of smm1 & 2 .    in the eagle nebula , white et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that pre - existing clumps in the molecular cloud formed barriers to the ionising winds from the massive stars in the hii region , and that the columns were essentially the ` wind shadows ' of these clumps . in this picture the clumps are eventually eroded by the massive stars , or else triggered into forming stars , in both cases meaning they are relatively short - lived .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented an alternative scenario in which columns occur as natural instabilities in nature and can be quite long - lived . for the horsehead nebula ,",
    "pound et al . ( 2003 ) argued for a relatively short lifetime for the nebula .",
    "turning to our data , we see that smm1 is clearly associated with the molecular cloud behind the pdr that is essentially the ` working surface ' between the hii region and the cloud .",
    "the shape of the densest part of smm1 is somewhat curved , as is the edge of the obscuration seen at the very ` top ' of the horse s head in the optical image .",
    "if this curve were seen as an arc that formed part of a circle , then the centre of that circle would be somewhere in the vicinity of @xmath9 ori , the star believed to be responsible for forming the pdr ( abergel et al .",
    "this appears to lend support to the hypothesis that smm1 has been affected by its interaction with @xmath9 ori .",
    "smm2 lies further ` down ' the column of the horsehead , and apparently further from @xmath9 ori .",
    "it also appears to be being shielded by the remainder of the head and by smm1 .",
    "hence it would appear that smm2 may have been a pre - existing clump rather than a density enhancement caused by some form of ` snow - plough effect ' ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "it is possible that the three - dimensional geometry of the nebula puts smm2 slightly foreground to smm1 , and hence it is not shielded .",
    "in fact , in the optical image it is possible to discern a slightly brighter ridge roughly coincident with the ` top ' of smm2 , so it may be that it is protruding somewhat from the near - side of the cloud .",
    "however , there is no evidence for any significant pdr associated with this ridge .",

    "we assume that the gas flows away from the ionisation front at constant speed equal to the speed of sound in the ionised gas , @xmath105 .",
    "consequently the density , @xmath106 , in the ionised gas flowing off the globule is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is radius measured from the centre of the globule , and @xmath109 is the boundary of the globule .",
    "since most of the ionising photons incident on the globule will be used up maintaining ionisation in the outflowing gas ( rather than ionising new gas ) , we can put @xmath110 here @xmath111 is the rate at which ionising photons are emitted by the exciting star ; for @xmath9 ori , which is an o9.5 star , we adopt @xmath112 ( schaerer & de koter , 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath113 is the distance between the exciting star and the globule ; we adopt the projected distances @xmath114 for b33-smm1 , and @xmath115 for b33-smm2 .",
    "@xmath116 is the recombination coefficient for atomic hydrogen into excited states only  in accordance with the on - the - spot approximation  at the canonical temperature for the gas in an hii region , @xmath117 .",
    "we note that in reality the outward flow of gas from the globule may be accelerated by the inward pressure gradient , but the integral in equation  ( [ eqn : ionbal ] ) is dominated by the region near the ionisation front , and so this is unlikely to be a large correction .    from equation ( [ eqn : ionbal ] ) , we obtain @xmath118 hence the pressure acting on the boundary of the globule , @xmath119 , is given by @xmath120 where there is a factor 2 to allow for the contribution from electrons ( assuming @xmath121 ) and a factor 2 to allow for the recoil of the ionised gas at speed @xmath122 .",
    "since this pressure only acts on one side of the globule , we estimate the contribution to the virial theorem as @xmath123 for b33-smm1 we obtain @xmath124 , and for b33-smm2 , @xmath125 .",
    "we have not taken account of the shadowing effect of the nebula on smm2 in this pressure term , hence it is quoted as an upper limit in table  3 .",
    "we note that habart et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found an external pressure for smm1 of @xmath1 4 @xmath3 10@xmath6 k@xmath5 , which converts to a value of @xmath126 in our terminology .",
    "this is in remarkably good agreement with our finding of @xmath124 , using a completely different calculation .",
    "this independent check gives us further confidence in our calculated values .    from the entries in table [ tab : virial ]",
    ", it appears that neither condensation is unequivocally bound if we look at the gravitational term alone .",
    "for smm1 the left - hand side of equation 6 has a value of 22 ( in units of 10@xmath127 erg ) compared to a gravitational term of only 3 .",
    "hence this is roughly an order of magnitude away from gravitational equilibrium .",
    "however , the pressure term has a value of 100 , which would appear to tip the core very strongly in favour of collapse",
    ". we should be mindful that the external pressure only acts on one side of the condensation .",
    "therefore it may simply push the condensation along by the rocket effect ( kahn 1954 ; oort & spitzer 1955 ) rather than causing it to collapse , although the pressure from the rest of the cloud would tend to act to prevent this .",
    "for smm2 the left hand side of equation 6 has a value of 30 ( in units of 10@xmath127 erg ) compared to a gravitational term of 22 .",
    "these two values are remarkably similar , given the uncertainties in all of the above calculations .",
    "for example , an increase in the mass assumed for smm2 of @xmath12820% is all that is required make the two values equal .",
    "this is well within the uncertainties of our calculations , as discussed above .",
    "therefore , we deduce that smm2 is consistent with being in gravitational virial equilibrium , without any consideration of the external pressure",
    ".    this would appear to suggest that smm2 was a pre - existing clump in b33 and is a candidate pre - stellar core ( c.f .",
    "ward - thompson et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the external pressure term is quoted as an upper limit because we have not taken account of any shielding of smm2 by the rest of the cloud .",
    "nevertheless , if smm1 is triggered to form stars , and the shock front and ionisation front move further into the cloud , then the shielding would be removed and the full value quoted in table  3 would be applicable . in that case",
    "we would say that smm2 is also destined to collapse under the influence of the external pressure .",
    "we re - iterate that inequality 6 is strictly only the condition for a clump to start contracting .",
    "once contraction approaches freefall collapse , the non - thermal velocity dispersion has an increasing contribution from ordered inward motion , and therefore @xmath52 as defined in equation 8 should be interpreted as the sum of the turbulent and bulk infall energies , with the latter contribution becoming dominant . during collapse @xmath129 and",
    "therefore quite quickly @xmath130 . under this circumstance ,",
    "the only way to confirm collapse is by measuring asymmetric line profiles .",
    "however , in the present case the fact that for smm1 @xmath131 , and for smm2 @xmath132 suggests that neither clump is collapsing , yet .    we can estimate the speed , @xmath133 , at which the shock front preceding the ionisation front advances into each condensation , using conservation of mass across the ionisation front : @xmath134 and hence the time @xmath135 it will take to ionise the whole of each existing condensation , @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the distance to be travelled . in each case",
    "we took the shortest dimension , as we assumed that the cores are being flattened by the ionisation front , causing them to lie parallel to it .    combining equations ( [ eqn : ionden ] ) , ( [ eqn : ifspeed ] ) and ( [ eqn : lifetime ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath138 and @xmath139 for b33-smm1 ; @xmath140 and @xmath141 for b33-smm2",
    ". however , these should be viewed as minimum lifetimes for the condensations , since they ignore the likelihood that the condensations are growing by sweeping up gas on the side opposite to the ionisation front",
    ". nonetheless these values are consistent with the 5-myr lifetime found for the entire nebula by pound et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "hence we find that smm1 is being strongly affected by @xmath9 ori and hence may be forced into some form of triggered collapse . on",
    "the other hand smm2 appears to have been a pre - existing clump in the molecular cloud  possibly a pre - stellar core  which is in approximate gravitational virial equilibrium , but which may also eventually be forced into collapse by the external pressure from the hii region .",
    "we have presented scuba images of the horsehead nebula , b33 , at 450 and 850  @xmath0 m which show the familiar shape of the dust cloud responsible for the extinction in this famous nebula .",

    "we calculated the virial balance of this clump , and found that the effect of the ionising radiation from the nearby hii region has the strongest influence on its balance , such that it may subsequently undergo triggered star formation .",
