    "the _ swift _ satellite @xcite is a multi - instrument observatory designed to detect and rapidly localize gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the observatory contains three instruments .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) is used to identify grbs and localize them to @xmath5 in the energy range 15150 kev .",
    "once a burst has been detected _ swift _ slews to point its two narrow - field instruments , the @xmath0-ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) , and the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) at the burst .",
    "the xrt obtains @xmath0-ray localizations to @xmath6 in the energy range 0.210 kev .",
    "the uvot simultaneously obtains localizations to @xmath7 then cycles through a set of optical and ultraviolet filters .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flash ( xrf ) xrf  050416a was detected in the constellation coma berenices by the bat at 11:04:44.5 utc @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray light curve showed a slowly rising peak followed by several smaller peaks .",
    "the burst had a @xmath8 duration of only @xmath9 s in the 15150 kev band .",
    "@xcite find a peak energy of @xmath10 kev , making xrf  050416a a soft burst , and they classify xrf  050416a as an xrf .",
    "the fluence was @xmath11 erg @xmath12 in the 15150 kev band @xcite .",
    "the fluence in the soft 1525 kev band ( @xmath13 erg @xmath12 ) was larger than that in the harder 50100 kev band ( @xmath14 erg @xmath12 ) .",
    "this , and the low peak energy , makes xrf  050416a an xrf . a detailed analysis of the gamma - ray properties of xrf  050416a is presented in @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-ray afterglow was identified by @xcite and is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray light curve follows the canonical @xmath0-ray light curve described by @xcite with an early - time decay of @xmath15 out to 172 s , where the flux density , @xmath16 , is related to the time since the bat trigger by @xmath17 .",
    "the canonical light curve has an initially steep decay due to curvature effects in the relativistic fireball .",
    "this is followed by a slow decay due to energy injection .",
    "the light curve makes a second transition to a decay slope of approximately @xmath18 when energy injection ends .",
    "the slow decay section for xrf  050416a has a slope of @xmath19 and lasts from 172 to 1450 s. the late - time decay has a slope of @xmath20 , which continues until at least 42 days after the bat trigger . the @xmath0-ray spectrum after 1450 s has a slope of @xmath21 , where the relationship between flux density and frequency is @xmath22 , and shows evidence for a hydrogen column density in the host galaxy of @xmath23 @xmath12 .",
    "if we assume the @xcite relationship between hydrogen column density and extinction in the milky way , @xmath24 , then this column density implies @xmath25 in the host galaxy along the line of sight to xrf  050416a .",
    "the optical afterglow was first identified by @xcite using the palomar 200-inch hale telescope and confirmed by @xcite using the anu 2.3-m telescope .",
    "@xcite noted that the afterglow is visible in the uvot s uvw2 filter and stated that this indicates a redshift of @xmath26 .",
    "a spectrum of the host galaxy was obtained 51 days after the burst by @xcite .",
    "they measured a redshift for the host of @xmath27 from [ oii ] , h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , and h@xmath30 emission lines .",
    "the host s blue colour suggests ongoing star formation , as is seen in many grb host galaxies .",
    "uvot magnitudes , based on preliminary photometric calibrations , were published by @xcite .",
    "this paper supersedes those results .",

    "hard bursts @xcite xrf  050416a , with a redshift of 0.6535 , is one of the nearest of the _ swift_-detected grbs with spectral redshift determinations .",
    "its @xmath8 duration and @xmath33 are similar to those of the xrf  050406 @xcite and are fairly typical of xrfs in general . @xcite",

    "this suggests that xrfs and grbs are intimately related .",
    "xrf  050416a does not , however , follow the the empirical relation between @xmath35 , @xmath34 , and the jet break time in the rest frame , @xmath36 of @xcite , which suggests that either this xrf has an unusually late jet break or that something is preventing us from seeing the jet break , such as a long - lasting emission component .",
    "something similar was seen in grb  021004 , where identifying the jet break was complicated by several emission components @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the sed is shown in figure  [ figure : sed ] .",
    "the sed was fit by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the flux density at frequency @xmath189 , @xmath28 is the intrinsic spectral index , and @xmath190 is the extragalactic extinction in the host ( @xmath41 ) at frequency @xmath189 .",

    "the low value of the extinction in the host is at odds with the high neutral hydrogen column density found by fitting the @xmath0-ray spectrum @xcite .",

    "the ultraviolet / optical / infrared sed at 60415 s has a slope of @xmath201 , after correcting for extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the intrinsic spectral slope derived from the @xmath0-ray data .",
    "the lack of evidence for a change in either the intrinsic spectral slope or the decay rate between the @xmath0-ray and optical bands suggests that there is no spectral break between these two regimes .",

    "the spectral and temporal decay rates can be used to predict the index of the electron energy distribution , @xmath203 .",

    "both the @xmath0-ray and ultraviolet / optical / infrared spectral slopes are consistent with @xmath231 , which corresponds to @xmath232 for @xmath209 , which is unusually high for a grb .",

    "this decay slope is slightly steeper than the observed decay rate of @xmath236 , but it is within the observed uncertainties .",

    "@xcite find that the isotropic equivalent energy of xrf  050416a is @xmath238 erg .",
    "this , and the observed limits on the jet break time , can be used to estimate the opening angle of the jet and thus the total gamma - ray energy of the burst @xcite .",
    "the jet opening angle for xrf  050416a is    @xmath239    where @xmath240 is the observed jet break time in days since the bat trigger , @xmath241 is the efficiency of converting energy in the ejecta into gamma rays , and @xmath242 is the particle density in @xmath243 .",

    "this result is not strongly sensitive to our choices of @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "the corresponding energy in gamma rays , corrected for beaming , is @xmath248 erg .",
    "the upper limit on the gamma - ray energy can be obtained from the case where there is no beaming ( and thus no jet break ) . in that case",
    "@xmath249 , which implies that @xmath250 erg @xmath251 erg .",
    "therefore the total energy must be less than the canonical grb energy of @xcite if there is any beaming .",
    "@xcite showed that xrf  050416a fits onto the amati relation @xcite between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "they also showed that this burst can not be made to satisfy the ghirlanda relation @xcite between @xmath252 and @xmath35 due to the lack of a jet break out to 35 days after the bat trigger . @xcite",
    "have shown that there is no jet break to at least 42 days , which makes the discrepancy with the ghirlanda relation even larger .",
    "the @xcite relation    @xmath253    implies that the jet break should occur at @xmath254 days after the bat trigger in the observer s frame .",
    "if we assume that xrf  050416a has a two - component jet with a narrow component that breaks at 1.5 days the observed decay between 1.5 and 42 days will be the sum of the post - narrow - jet break component for the narrow jet and the post - cooling break component for the wide jet .",
    "a two - component jet model has been proposed to explain some of the observed features in the decays of grb  030329 @xcite , such as the presence of two achromatic breaks .",
    "we propose that the observed optical afterglow of xrf  050416a may be the sum of two jets that both conform with the ghirlanda relation and the liang & zhang relation . in this picture",
    "the narrow jet would have an opening angle of @xmath255 assuming @xmath256 days , and the wide jet would have @xmath257 for a wide jet break time of @xmath258 days .",
    "the gamma - ray energies in each jet are @xmath259 erg and @xmath260 erg , which is roughly consistent with the division of energy in the two - component jet model for grb  030329 .",
    "@xcite find that for two component jets where the total energy in the wide jet is greater than that in the narrow jet the wide jet will dominate the optical afterglow after approximately 0.11 days .",
    "since the deceleration time of the wide jet is similar to the break time of the narrow jet the emergence of the wide jet at this time can mask the steepening of the light curve caused by the jet break in the narrow component .",
    "we suggest that this is what has happened in xrf  050416a .",
    "we see no evidence for a change in the spectral slope or the decay rate between the optical and @xmath0-ray regimes at 60415 s ( @xmath202 days ) .",
    "this implies that both the narrow and wide components have cooling frequencies below the optical band at this time .",
    "uvot observation in the @xmath58-band filter were taken up to 74 days after the bat trigger .",
    "we searched the late time exposure for evidence of a rebrightening .",
    "there is one low - significance uvot detection of the afterglow after 144815 s ( 1.676 d ) .",
    "there is a second low - significance detection at 3732868 s ( 43 d ) .",
    "a visual examination of the second detection suggests that it is a noise spike in the data and not a point source .    a type ib / c supernova like sn1998bw @xcite at the distance of xrf  050416a is expected to peak at approximately @xmath261 days after the burst .",
    "we find no evidence for a source at the location of the afterglow at this time down to a 3@xmath63 limiting magnitude of @xmath262 in coadded exposures .",
    "for @xmath263 the observed @xmath58 band approximately corresponds to the rest frame @xmath65 band , so our upper limit corresponds to @xmath264 .",
    "sn1998bw had a peak @xmath65-band absolute magnitude of @xmath265 @xcite so the uvot data is not able to constrain the existence of a supernova component to the afterglow of xrf  050416a .",
    "xrf  050416a is a near - by ( @xmath41 ) , short ( @xmath266 s ) xrf that shows no evidence for a jet break out to at least 42 days after the burst .",
    "the spectral slope and decay rate are the same in the optical as in phase c of the @xmath0-ray decay @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there is no cooling break between approximately 1.24  ( 10 kev ) and 22000  ( 0.006 kev ) at 60415 s after the burst .",
    "further , the constancy of the decay suggests that the cooling break did not pass through the optical between 1450 s ( 0.016 days ) and 406438 s ( 4.7 days ) , nor did it pass through the @xmath0-ray regime between 1450 s ( 0.016 days ) and @xmath267 s ( 42 days ) .",
    "we find the best agreement with the synchrotron model occurs if the cooling break is below the optical at 60415 s ( 0.7 days ) after the burst .",
    "the optical light decay slope is @xmath2 and the intrinsic ultraviolet / optical / infrared spectral slope is @xmath268 .",
    "the best estimate of the electron index is @xmath269 .",
    "we are unable to distinguish between a burst occurring in a homogeneous environment or a wind - stratified one .",
    "the lack of a jet break out to @xmath270 days implies that the jet opening angle is @xmath271 and the gamma - ray energy is @xmath250 erg @xmath272 erg .",
    "if xrf  050416a has the canonical energy of @xcite then the burst is not beamed .",
    "an alternate interpretation of the data is that xrf  050416a has a two component jet .",
    "the narrow component has an opening angle of @xmath255 and experienced a jet break at 1.5 days , in agreement with the prediction of the @xcite relation between @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the wide component does not break until at least 42 days after the burst and must have an opening angle of @xmath273 .",
    "the wide component jet contains approximately 14 times more energy than the narrow component jet does .",
    "this behaviour is similar to what was seen in grb  030329 @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for a large amount of extinction along the line of sight to xrf  050416a .",
    "the best fit ultraviolet / optical / infrared spectrum suggests that @xmath274 mag in the host galaxy .",
    "this is inconsistent with the large hydrogen column density implied by the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "if we assume that the gas - to - dust ratio in the host is the same as that in the milky way the implied extinction is @xmath25 mag . using the extinction derived from the optical data and the hydrogen column density derived from the @xmath0-ray data the gas - to - dust ratio in the host is @xmath275",
