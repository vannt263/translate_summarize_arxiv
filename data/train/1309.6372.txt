    "behavioural experiments suggest that migratory birds possess a magnetic compass sensor able to detect the direction of the geomagnetic field @xcite .",
    "one hypothesis for the basis of this remarkable sensory ability is that the coherent quantum spin dynamics of photoinduced radical pair reactions transduces directional magnetic information from the geomagnetic field into changes of reaction yields @xcite , possibly involving the photoreceptor cryptochrome in the birds retina @xcite .",
    "the suggested radical - pair based magnetic compass sensor has attracted attention in the field of quantum biology @xcite as an example of a biological sensor which might exploit quantum coherences for its biological function . uncovering the design principles of such a spin - based sensor can pave the way for the design of man - made quantum - based magnetic sensors @xcite .",
    "investigations on radical - pair based compass sensors have focussed on identifying the design features optimizing directional sensitivity to weak magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , a possible role of non - trivial quantum effects such as entanglement @xcite or the quantum zeno effect @xcite in magnetoreception has been discussed .",
    "finally , the use of quantum control techniques @xcite , gradient fields via magnetic nanostructures @xcite and photo - control techniques @xcite have been explored as means to enhance magneto - sensitivity .    in the radical pair mechanism , after a radical pair is formed in a spin - conserving reaction from a singlet or triplet precursor , the spin state of the radical pair oscillates via quantum coherences determined , in the simplest formulation , by hyperfine interactions only .",
    "an external magnetic field of comparable intensity to the geomagnetic field can influence the spin dynamics via weak zeeman interactions by unlocking some zero - field degenerate coherences , thus affecting the singlet yield @xcite . because hyperfine interactions are generally anisotropic ,",
    "the singlet yield will depend on the intensity as well as on the direction of the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the singlet product yield on the direction of the geomagnetic field is the initial signal containing directional information .",
    "the steps transducing this signal further are still unclear @xcite .",
    "regardless of the mechanism of signal transduction , the question arises how one should design a radical pair system such as to optimize its directional sensitivity . besides kinetic considerations , a key factor is the choice of the nuclear spin environment @xcite .",
    "directional sensitivity is optimized for strong internal magnetic field gradients @xcite , which can be realised by the absence of hyperfine interactions on one radical @xcite .",
    "more realistic models include dipolar and electron exchange interactions that can affect singlet yields , thereby reducing the directional sensitivity of a radical - pair based compass @xcite .",
    "moreover , radical pairs are never perfectly ordered in biological systems further reducing directional sensitivity @xcite .",
    "so far , these models all assume that the hyperfine interactions themselves are constant .",
    "however , proteins fluctuate on many time scales , with fluctuations generally being larger for slower time scales @xcite .",
    "such protein movement affects quantum states of co - factors , as observed e.g.  in photosynthetic proteins @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect fluctuations of quantum parameters ( e.g.  hyperfine tensors ) in the flavin co - factors over many time scales including times longer than radical pair reaction times .",
    "moreover , one expects that these slow fluctuations are at least of the same size as fast fluctuations @xcite .",
    "hyperfine interactions of flavin radicals , crucial for the functioning of a cryptochrome - based compass sensor @xcite , were estimated to fluctuate on short time scales with an average magnitude of @xmath0 gauss ( g ) , due to the influence of the local protein environment @xcite and similarly sized fluctuations should occur over longer times as well .    here , we ask whether some nuclear spin environments promote signals that are more robust to slow hyperfine interaction fluctuations than others .",
    "clearly , such environments are advantageous for a biological compass sensor because they prevent degradation of directional information without the need for additional , e.g.  neuronal , compensation mechanisms .",
    "our study is extending and complementing studies investigating optimal nuclear spin environments for directional information @xcite , that have so far neglected the effects of such fluctuations expected to be present in realistic environments .",
    "we study a photoinduced radical pair where the two electron spins interact only with the magnetic nuclei on their respective molecular moieties via hyperfine interactions and with an external magnetic field via the zeeman interaction .",
    "furthermore , the radicals are considered to form perfectly ordered crystals so as not to average out the anisotropy necessary for directional effects .",
    "the singlet yield is calculated following the phenomenological density matrix approach , developed by the spin chemistry community @xcite and successfully tested experimentally @xcite .",
    "we consider a radical pair created in a spin - correlated singlet state , described by the spin density operator , @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the singlet projection operator .",
    "the coherent evolution of the pair is obtained from the liouville - von neumann equation as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 denoting the spin hamiltonian .",
    "the time dependent probability that the radical pair is in a singlet state is : @xmath5=\\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_{m=1}^{4m}\\sum_{n=1}^{4m}|p^{s}_{mn}|^{2}\\cos\\left(\\nu_{mn } t\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the number of nuclear spin configurations and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the spin system oscillates via quantum coherences ( @xmath8 ) between singlet and triplet states at frequencies @xmath9",
    "corresponding to the energy gap between pairs of eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 of @xmath4 . at the same time , singlet and triplet pairs recombine forming distinct singlet and triplet products .    assuming a spin - independent first - order decay rate @xmath12 for the re - encounter probability distribution @xcite",
    ", we calculate the singlet yield , @xmath13 , as @xmath14 , which gives : @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting a lorentzian function .",
    "a coherence @xmath17 @xmath18 contributes to the biologically detectable signal @xmath13 if its frequency has time to evolve before spin coherence is lost , i.e.  @xmath19 .",
    "we study a class of radical pairs in which one radical is devoid of hyperfine interactions , whereas the other one interacts with the surrounding nuclei through axial hyperfine ( hf ) interactions .",
    "this particular class has been suggested to be optimally sensitive and matches some of the functional characteristics of the avian magnetic compass observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "we consider two models of radical pair - based magnetic compass sensors : one is the simplest geomagnetic compass sensor comprising two electron spins @xmath20 and @xmath21 and one spin @xmath22-nucleus @xmath23 coupled , without loss of generality , with spin a , whereas in the second model spin a interacts with two spin @xmath22-nuclei .",
    "the corresponding spin hamiltonians @xmath4 are : @xmath24 with @xmath25 denoting the number of nuclei .",
    "we call these two models , respectively , one - hf ( @xmath26 ) and two - hf ( @xmath27 ) radical pair model .",
    "@xmath28 is the electron larmor frequency in the applied magnetic field @xmath29 , with @xmath30 denoting the electron gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath31 is an axial tensor given in its diagonal form by a = diag(@xmath32 ) .",
    "the following convention is used to parametrise the axial symmetry : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the strength and @xmath36 the axiality of the hyperfine interaction . finally , without loss of generality , @xmath37 is the polar angle between the external magnetic field and the radical pair system .    for more realistic models , with more than two hyperfine interactions ,",
    "the direction of the external magnetic field with respect to the radical pair system is defined by the azimuth and polar angles . while the one - hf and two - hf models are special cases , they allow us to reduce the parameter space neglecting the azimuth angle .",
    "thus , considering the dependence of the spin hamiltonian on the polar angle @xmath37 in equation ( [ eq : h_tot ] ) we can calculate straightforwardly the signal @xmath38 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : yield ] , for these two models .",
    "we quantify angular sensitivity , @xmath39 , as the difference between the maximum @xmath40 and minimum @xmath41 of the singlet yield as a function of @xmath37 , @xmath42 .",
    "for the one - hf radical pair model , the angular dependence of the singlet yield @xmath38 can be found analytically in the approximation of weak zeeman interaction with respect to the hyperfine interaction , i.e.  for the electron larmor frequency @xmath43 being much smaller than all zero - field quantum coherences , and the rate constant @xmath12 slow enough to allow all quantum coherences to evolve , i.e.  @xmath44 . in this approximation , which we summarize as @xmath45 , two regions can be distinguished , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : as ] : region i , for @xmath45 with @xmath46 , where the signal @xmath47 @xcite and the corresponding angular sensitivity @xmath48 are independent on the hyperfine parameters ; region ii , for @xmath45 with @xmath49 , where the signal is @xmath50 and has an angular sensitivity of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the signal from region ii corresponds to a theoretical limit case , where the hyperfine tensor reduces to a vector . in region",
    "iii the rate constant @xmath12 is slow enough to allow all quantum coherences to evolve , and the electron larmor frequency is almost of the same order of magnitude as all zero - field quantum coherences , i.e.  @xmath52 .",
    "we summarize region iii as @xmath53 with @xmath54 . in region",
    "iii the analytical expression of the angular dependence of the singlet yield is more complicated and depends strongly on the hyperfine parameters .    we numerically evaluate the angular sensitivity for hyperfine coupling strengths @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) between @xmath57 and @xmath58 g , i.e.  a range of values typically encountered in organic radicals , and all possible values for the axiality @xmath36 .     as a function of the strength , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , in gauss ( g ) , and axiality @xmath36 of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the rate constant is @xmath59 mhz and the geomagnetic field is set to @xmath60 g. the angular sensitivity is calculated as @xmath61 .",
    "the dashed lines define the plateau region of angular sensitivity @xmath62 ( region i ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : as ] shows the angular sensitivity @xmath39 as a function of strength @xmath55 and axiality @xmath36 of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the rate constant is @xmath59 mhz and geomagnetic field strength @xmath29 is set to @xmath60 g. numerical calculations are in agreement with the analytical ones and give more information on the signals generated by the one - hf radical pair model .",
    "we note that region i , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : as ] by the green color and defined by the dashed lines , is a wide plateau region of angular sensitivity @xmath62 that occurs for strengths @xmath63 g and axialities @xmath46 .",
    "we also note that region ii , with an angular sensitivity of @xmath64 , occurs for hyperfine strengths @xmath65 g and axiality @xmath49 in agreement with the results in @xcite and represents the highest angular sensitivity reachable within the hyperfine interactions range considered here .",
    "we will see that such signal , although showing the highest angular sensitivity , is strongly affected by fluctuations of hyperfine tensor .",
    "furthermore , from fig .  [",
    "fig : as ] we note region iii roughly corresponding to hyperfine strengths @xmath66 g and axiality @xmath54 . this region contains a wide range of angular sensitivity values because the signals depend strongly on the hf parameters , especially on the axiality .",
    "greater axialities , @xmath67 , enhance angular sensitivity , whereas axialities with @xmath68 reduce angular sensitivity .",
    "we perform the same calculations for different rate constants , i.e.  @xmath69 mhz and find qualitatively identical results .",
    "so far , signals and corresponding directional sensitivities are calculated neglecting hyperfine fluctuations .",
    "it was found that fluctuations of hyperfine tensors in flavin radicals @xcite follow roughly gaussian distributions , with an estimate of @xmath0 g on average for the standard deviations . taking this estimation , to simulate hyperfine tensor fluctuations , for each strength @xmath55 and axiality",
    "@xmath36 we draw a set of hyperfine tensor components @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , from two gaussian distributions with respective means @xmath72 and @xmath73 and identical standard deviation of @xmath0 g. we consider such fluctuations on a timescale longer than the radical pair lifetime ( fluctuations much faster than quantum coherences are averaged out ) , which we choose to be @xmath74 .",
    "thus , for each set of hyperfine tensor fluctuations we calculate the corresponding set of @xmath75 angular dependences of singlet yields @xmath76 , which represents the directional signal at different times @xmath77 , with @xmath37 ranging from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "we then calculate the angular dependence of the mean singlet yield @xmath80 and corresponding standard deviation @xmath81 by averaging over the @xmath75 samples for each angle @xmath37 .",

    "[ fig : asmstdym ] ( a ) we note that , under fluctuations , the mean angular sensitivity @xmath87 remains quantitatively similar to @xmath39 without fluctuations . indeed , we can still discriminate the three regions described for the static case .",
    "however , we note that fluctuations of hyperfine tensor components give rise to a lower mean angular sensitivity , in general , for hyperfine axiality @xmath89 .    furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : asmstdym ] ( b ) depicting the robustness @xmath90 in logarithm units as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath36 , shows that for the one - hf radical pair model , region ii and region iii are not robust with corresponding signals highly affected by fluctuations .",
    "only region i , the plateau region for the static case ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : as ] ) is robust against fluctuations .",
    "we find that such a robustness persists under fluctuations of @xmath57 g standard deviation , which is the largest standard deviation found for the hyperfine tensor fluctuations in the flavin radicals .",

    "we perform the same calculations for slower rate constants , i.e.  @xmath69 mhz , and find the same results as for @xmath59 mhz , with region i being still the only robust region .",

    "we find that when both radicals have one hyperfine interaction each the angular sensitivity is substantially suppressed @xcite .",

    "we have investigated the effect of slow fluctuations in the protein environment and , hence , hyperfine interactions , on the signals arising from a radical - pair based compass sensor . evaluating these effects on two radical - pair models with a wide parameter range",
    "reveals that the nuclear spin environment has a significant influence on the size of perturbative effects of such fluctuations .",
    "in fact , some nuclear spin environments can make a radical - pair based compass sensor virtually immune to the influence of slow fluctuations .",
    "such robustness is a design feature separate from optimality .",
    "an optimal compass sensor can be found when the directional sensitivity is maximized ( maximum angular sensitivity ) , whereas a robust sensor is one where the directional sensitivity remains unaffected by fluctuations regardless of the magnitude of directional sensitivity .",
    "the question arises whether one can maximize both optimality and robustness at the same time . in the one - hf radical pair model ,",
    "the optimal choice of parameters ( maximal anisotropy of the hyperfine interaction ) , resulting in an angular sensitivity of @xmath107 , does not turn out to be robust .",
    "however , the second best choice , resulting in an angular sensitivity of @xmath116 is robust , whereas other parameters with even lower sensitivities reduce robustness as well .",
    "this indicates that there is not a simple trade - off between optimality and robustness with one increasing while the other decreases .",
    "the interplay between optimality and robustness becomes more complex when multiple hyperfine interactions are involved .",
    "perhaps the most noteworthy observation from our results is that simply adding another hyperfine interaction can increase robustness over a wide range of parameters , while leaving the sensitivity largely unaffected , and that there are sweet spots where high optimality and robustness can be achieved .",
    "further studies will need to confirm whether this trend continues for larger numbers of hyperfine interactions .",
    "the goal of this manuscript is to raise the issue of robustness in addition to optimality in the discussion of quantum - based magnetic compass sensors .",
