    "the focus of this paper is three - fold :    1 .   to review an historically significant problem in analytic number theory , 2 .   to describe a particular branch of @xmath2 , 3 .   using ( 2 ) , solve ( 1 ) in a more elementary way .    in 1859 , bernhard riemann published `` on the number of primes less than a given magnitude''@xmath4 , and introduced an analytic continuation of the euler product he called the zeta function : @xmath5 . using @xmath5 , infinite product representations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 functions and relying on advanced principles of analysis , riemann went on to derive an analytic expression for a function he called @xmath0 equal to the number of prime numbers under @xmath1 .",
    "however , if a branch of @xmath2 is carefully chosen , riemann s expression for @xmath0 can be derived via the residue theorem using simpler techniques of analysis .",
    "this approach is described below .    throughout this paper ,",
    "a complex variable is represented as @xmath8 , and the non - trivial zeros of the zeta function with positive imaginary component as @xmath9 ( or just @xmath10 in some cases ) , such that @xmath11 .",
    "the principal branch of the complex logarithm is denoted by log and other branches are given by log .",
    "common in complex analysis , log represents logarithm to base e , that is log(e)=1 .",
    "that convention is used here . in all cases ,",
    "the variable x is taken to be a real number greater than one .",
    "riemann derives his prime counting function by beginning with the euler product :    @xmath12 taking logarithms of the above gives @xmath13 and remembering @xmath14 for @xmath15z@xmath161 , we obtain    @xmath17 replacing each prime power with @xmath18 we can express equation as    @xmath19    with @xmath20 @xmath0 is equal to the number of primes strictly less than @xmath1 and as is common in fourier theory , at points of discontinuity , namely at prime numbers , it is defined to be one - half the difference between it s old and new value . with this definition of @xmath0",
    ", we see @xmath21 begins at 0 for x=0 and increases by a jump of 1 at primes , by a jump of 1/2 at prime squares @xmath22 , by a jump of @xmath23 at prime cubes @xmath24 , etc .",
    "that is , @xmath21 is zero for @xmath25 , is @xmath26 for @xmath27 , is 1 for @xmath28 , is @xmath29 for @xmath30 , is @xmath31 for @xmath32 , is @xmath33 for @xmath34 , is @xmath35 for @xmath36 , is @xmath37 for @xmath38 and so on . from @xmath21 ,",
    "one can find @xmath0 via mbius inversion to obtain @xmath39 with @xmath40 a positive integer such that @xmath41 .",
    "the function f(x ) is riemann s prime counting function and riemann s derivation of an analytic expression for @xmath21 and thus @xmath0 , is the principal result of his paper .",
    "he accomplished this by inverting via fourier inversion giving    @xmath42    in order to evaluate , riemann expressed @xmath5 in terms of the @xmath43 function :    @xmath44 and solved for @xmath45 .",
    "he then expressed both @xmath7 and @xmath46 in terms of their infinite product representations and proceeded to evaluate the resulting integrals directly to obtained .",

    "for a further explanation of , see edwards and ingham @xcite .",
    "although riemann s work represents a beautiful case study in analysis , his approach to evaluating was based on advanced methods of analysis . in this paper , is evaluated more simply using a holomorphic branch of @xmath2 .",
    "the geometry of this branch is investigated and the results used to derive an integral expression for @xmath21 which is then evaluated via the residue theorem .",
    "the function @xmath64 is holomorphic in the half - plane @xmath65 since @xmath5 is non - zero there",
    ". however , there exists a holomorphic branch that extends to the left half - plane .",
    "proof of the following theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath66 is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function in a simply connected region @xmath67 , then there exists a holomorphic function @xmath68 on @xmath67 such that @xmath69 the function @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 , and determines a `` branch '' of that logarithm .",
    "also : @xmath72 [ theorem001 ]    the trivial zeros of @xmath5 are located along the negative real axis at the points @xmath73 .",
    "the non - trivial zeros are symmetric in the critical strip @xmath74 to the line @xmath75 , and @xmath76 has one simple pole at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we can define @xmath67 to be the complex plane with branch cuts at the real axis extending from @xmath77 to one , and branch cuts of the form @xmath78 for each zero on the critical line and branch cuts between zeros for those off the critical line .",
    "we then construct a contour @xmath79 around @xmath67 .",
    "this contour is shown in figure ( [ fig : file1 ] ) and explained below .",
    "then @xmath80 is holomorphic in @xmath67 with    @xmath81    where the set @xmath82 represents the branch cuts , and the function @xmath83 is now a continuous and analytic function of @xmath84 throughout @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 with the path of integration remaining in @xmath67 .        in order use @xmath2 in this analysis",
    ", we must first understand the geometry of @xmath87 which we do now .",
    "@xmath88 is continuous except at the zeros of the zeta function and the point @xmath54 .",
    "the imaginary sheet , @xmath87 , is however more complicated , and a description of this sheet in the neighborhood of the branch cuts is needed in order to use the residue theorem to derive riemann s expression for @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath87 along a section of the black contours of @xmath79 is shown in figure ( [ fig : realaxiscloseup ] ) .",
    "note the stair - step geometry .",
    "the dark black trace is the contour below the real axis and the gray trace , above the real axis .",
    "empirical results suggest the difference in argument changes by @xmath89 at each step .",
    "we can prove this difference using the following theorem @xcite :    let @xmath90 be analytic with a simple pole at @xmath91 and @xmath92 be an arc of a circle of radius @xmath93 and angle @xmath94 centered at @xmath91 .",
    "then : @xmath95 [ theorem005 ]    consider now @xmath96 and the points @xmath97 and @xmath98 in figure ( [ fig : closeupat2 ] ) where @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 ( note the indentation around the origin applies only to @xmath102 ) .",
    "we then have in the limit as the black contours approach the real axis ,     along black contours of b(m ) ]    @xmath103    now , the first and third integrals are analytic outside some deleted neighborhood @xmath104 of @xmath54 and therefore the integrals in this region cancel as @xmath105 . inside @xmath104 ,    @xmath106    with @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",

    "therefore @xmath114    consider now the remaining two integrals inside @xmath104 .",
    "substituting into the integrals , the @xmath115 terms will again because they are analytic , cancel as @xmath105 leaving @xmath116    thus as the black contours in the range @xmath117 approach the real axis , @xmath118 and therefore @xmath119    now , the real part of @xmath5 in the range @xmath117 is negative and the imaginary part of @xmath5 is negative in the range @xmath120 along the upper black contour ( gray contour in figure [ fig : realaxiscloseup ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath87 along the upper black contour in the range @xmath101 must approach @xmath121 since this branch of @xmath83 is continuous and therefore by the expression above , @xmath87 along the lower contour is @xmath122 over the same range .",

    "then @xmath131 and @xmath132 therefore the imaginary component of @xmath2 along the upper black contour as it approaches the real axis in the range @xmath133 has the limit zero since we have shown above that @xmath134 for @xmath101 along the upper black contour has a limit of @xmath121 . this same approach can then be applied to the remaining components of the black contour to arrive at the geometry in figure ( [ fig : realaxiscloseup ] ) .",

    "empirical results indicate the red contour ( over the imaginary sheet of @xmath2 ) is @xmath136 that of the blue contour . a similar argument to that in section [ section31 ] can be used to explain this geometry : for a point @xmath137 on the blue contour and @xmath138 on the red contour , @xmath139 and because of symmetry ,",
    "@xmath140 for a deleted neighborhood surrounding each trivial zero on the critical line , called a `` common zero '' in this paper , we have @xmath141 making the same type of substitution as above gives @xmath142 this leaves @xmath143 and thus @xmath144 which is the value observed empirically",
    ".    we must also consider the possibility of zeros off the critical line .",
    "these are called `` rogue zeros '' in this paper .",
    "how would these effect the branch cuts ?",
    "we can artificially introduce such zeros by considering the function @xmath145 and numerically solve ( [ inteqn1 ] ) using this function . the plot in figure ( [ fig110:subfig : b ] )",

    "we now consider @xmath151 where @xmath79 includes the possibility of zeros off the critical line with the horizontal gray legs of the contour passing over certain lines with imaginary components equal to @xmath152 .",
    "since @xmath79 is closed over a function analytic throughout the region of integration , @xmath153 and therefore @xmath154    now @xmath155 over the purple contour and therefore we can replace @xmath2 with @xmath64 in that integral .",
    "multiplying by @xmath156 , and taking the limit as @xmath157 , @xmath158 where in , the appropriate limits are taken for each integral .",
    "we now go on to evaluate the various color - coded components of this expression .",
    "the green contours encircle each non - trivial zero of the zeta function .",
    "we allow the diameter of these contours to approach zero and take the following limit :    @xmath159 where @xmath160 represents the set of non - trivial zeros of the zeta function . writing this in terms of s=@xmath161",

    "the zeta function has simple zeros and therefore @xmath171 which tends to zero .",
    "this gives @xmath172 independent of the placement of non - trivial zeros .",
    "the cyan contours encircle the trivial zeros and yield the following integrals :    @xmath173 similar to the integrals over the green indentations , we express these integrals in terms of s=@xmath174 and since these zeros are simple , we obtain a similar limiting process : @xmath175 and therefore    @xmath176      the integral around the orange contour at s=1 yields @xmath177 similar to the integrals over the green indentations , we express the integral in terms of s=@xmath178 and arrive at a similar limiting process : @xmath179 the pole at s=1 is a simple pole so that this limit approaches the form @xmath180 therefore    @xmath181      we wish to consider the following limit : @xmath182 referring to figure ( [ fig : file1 ] ) , we can write this in terms of two integrals : @xmath183    note each integral traverses surfaces separated by a branch cut with @xmath184 as described in section [ section31 ] . as discussed in that section , @xmath185 over the upper contour",

    "the first term of the last integral tends to @xmath189 and the imaginary component of @xmath190(s ) over the contour near zero tends to @xmath191 .",
    "that is , @xmath192    using these values we have @xmath193    in the same way , @xmath87 over the lower contour approaches @xmath194 according to section [ section31 ] , and we obtain for that result :    @xmath195    therefore the sum of the integrals over the central brown contours as the diameters tend to zero is    @xmath196      we consider two cases : case i takes the zeros on the critical line and case ii considers zeros off the critical line .      in the case of zeros on the critical line , the value of log @xmath197(s ) on the blue contour is @xmath198 and the value on the red contour is @xmath199 as discussed in section [ subsection32 ] . in the limit as @xmath200 , the integrals over these contours as @xmath79 extends to infinity are    @xmath201    letting @xmath202 , then    @xmath203 and with @xmath204 gives @xmath205.\\ ] ] for the conjugate contours at @xmath206 , @xmath207\\ ] ] with the last integrals expressed in terms of the logarithmic integral as per .",
