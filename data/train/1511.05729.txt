    "the development of radioactive - ion beams in the mid-80s has enabled us to study the structure of nuclei away from stability .",
    "this has led to the discovery of exotic structures such as halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "halo nuclei exhibit an extended matter radius compared to stable nuclei .",
    "the unusual size of these neutron - rich nuclei is due to their small binding energy for one or two neutrons .",
    "thanks to this loose binding , the valence neutron(s ) tunnel far into the classically forbidden region and form a diffuse halo around a tight and well - bound core .",
    "the best known one - neutron halo nuclei are @xmath2be and @xmath0c , which can be seen as a @xmath3be or @xmath4c core , respectively , to which one neutron is loosely bound .",
    "archetypical two - neutron halo nuclei are @xmath5he and @xmath2li , with an @xmath6 and @xmath7li core , respectively . albeit much less probable ,",
    "proton haloes are also possible ; b is one of the nuclei that probably exhibit a one - proton halo .",
    "being located close to the drip lines , halo nuclei exhibit very short lifetimes , which impedes the use of regular spectroscopic techniques in their study . to study these fascinating structures ,",
    "we must then rely on indirect techniques such as elastic scattering or breakup . in the latter , the halo dissociates from the core during the collision with a target , hence revealing the internal cluster structure of the projectile . in order to infer correct nuclear - structure information from experimental data , an accurate theoretical description of the reaction , coupled to a realistic model of the nucleus under investigation",
    "is needed @xcite . in this contribution , we review the theoretical framework of the usual reaction models and describe in particular the continuum discretise coupled channel model ( cdcc ) @xcite and the dynamical eikonal approximation ( dea ) ( ) @xcite . in , we compare these two models on the case of the breakup of c on pb at intermediate ( @xmath1mev ) and low ( @xmath8mev ) energies @xcite .",
    "albeit precise , these models rely on inputs , such as optical potentials , which can significantly affect the theoretical predictions . to avoid this dependence a new reaction observable has been recently proposed .",
    "it consists of the ratio of angular distributions for two different processes , such as elastic scattering and breakup . taking this ratio",
    "significantly reduces the sensitivity to the reaction process and hence to the model inputs .",
    "accordingly this ratio is more sensitive to the projectile structure than usual reaction observables and can provide very accurate information about exotic nuclear structures .",
    "the ratio method is presented in before a brief summary in .",
    "the models of reactions involving one - nucleon halo nuclei usually rely on a three - body framework : a two - body projectile and a target .",
    "the internal structure of the projectile ( @xmath9 ) is described by the core ( @xmath10)-fragment ( @xmath11 ) hamiltonian h_0=t_r+v_cf ( ) , [ e1 ] where @xmath12 is the @xmath10-@xmath11 relative coordinate , @xmath13 is the kinetic energy term and @xmath14 is a phenomenological potential that simulates the @xmath10-@xmath11 interaction , whose parameters are adjusted to reproduce the energy and quantum numbers of the low - energy levels of the projectile .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath15 describe the @xmath10-@xmath11 relative motion h_0  _",
    "lm(e,)=e  _ lm(e , ) , [ e2 ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the @xmath10-@xmath11 relative orbital angular momentum and its projection , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the @xmath10-@xmath11 relative energy .",
    "the negative - energy states ( @xmath19 ) are discrete ; they correspond to the bound states of the projectile .",
    "the positive energy states correspond to the continuum of the @xmath10-@xmath11 system , i.e. the states in which the halo has broken up from the core .    the target ( @xmath20 ) is usually described as a structureless particle which interacts with the projectile constituents though optical potentials @xmath21 and @xmath22 . within that framework , studying the reaction reduces to solving the following three - body equation ( , ) = e_t  ( , ) [ e3 ] under the condition that the projectile is initially in its ground state @xmath23 ( , ) e^ikz+_l_0,m_0(e_0,),[e4 ] where the @xmath24 axis has been chosen along the incoming beam and the @xmath9-@xmath20 momentum is related to the total energy @xmath25 of the system : @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the @xmath9-@xmath20 reduced mass .",
    "various models have been developed to solve this equation numerically . in the following sections",
    ", we will describe two of them : the continuum - discretised coupled channel method ( cdcc ) and the dynamical eikonal approximation ( dea ) .      in cdcc",
    ", the three - body wave function @xmath28 is expanded upon the complete set of the eigenstates of @xmath15 : ( r , r)=_lm_e_i<0_lm(e_i,)_lm(e_i,)+_0^_lm(e,)_lm(e , )  de .",
    "[ e5 ] to be tractable numerically , the integral over the positive @xmath10-@xmath11 energy must be discretised .",
    "this is usually performed dividing the continuum into small bins and defining for each bin @xmath29 a normalised wave function _ i(r)=_e_i - e_i/2^e_i+e_i/2w(e)_lm(e , )  de , [ e6 ] where the index @xmath29 defines not only the energy , but also the partial wave @xmath30 of the bin state , @xmath31 is a weight function and @xmath32 is a normalisation coefficient",
    ".    with this discretisation , introducing the expansion into , leads to a tractable set of coupled equations in the unknown coefficients @xmath33 of the expansion _",
    "i+_jiv_ij_j = e_t  _ i , [ e7 ] where the couplings are due to the tidal force resulting from the difference of the action of the target @xmath20 upon the core @xmath10 and the halo @xmath11 v_ij=_i|v_ct+v_ft|_j .",
    "[ e8 ]      the dea is based on the eikonal approximation @xcite , which states that at sufficiently high energy , the three - body wave function @xmath28 does not deviate much from the incoming plane wave of .",
    "accordingly , this suggests to perform the following factorisation ( r , r)=e^ikz(r , r ) , [ e9 ] where @xmath34 varies smoothly with @xmath35 . introducing into , and neglecting the second - order derivative of @xmath34 in front of its first - order derivative , leads to the dea equation @xcite iv ( , , z ) = [ h_0-e_0+v_ct+v_ft ] ( , , z),[e10 ] where @xmath36 is the initial @xmath9-@xmath20 relative velocity .    must be solved for each value of @xmath37 , the transverse component of the @xmath9-@xmath20 relative coordinate @xmath38 , with the condition @xmath39 .",
    "being simpler to solve than the set of coupled equations , it leads to a much faster numerical scheme than cdcc @xcite .",
    "however , it is valid only at sufficiently high energy , whereas cdcc is not restricted in energy .",
    "to compare the two aforementioned models , we have performed numerical calculations for the breakup of c on pb at @xmath1mev @xcite , which correspond to the experimental conditions of .    as can be seen in ,",
    "both models provide nearly identical breakup cross sections .",
    "they lead to the same energy distribution ( , left ) and a mere tiny shift is observed in the angular distribution ( , right ) .",
    "this shows that although based on different assumptions , both models provide the same description of the reaction process , and hence lead to the same conclusions about the projectile structure .",
    "in particular , the excellent agreement between the calculations and the experimental data of confirms the halo structure of c.      as mentioned above , the eikonal approximation is only valid at high energy @xcite . to see",
    "what happens when the beam energy is lowered , we have repeated the calculations at @xmath8mev @xcite . as illustrated in",
    ", the dea predicts a breakup cross section too large with an angular distribution which is too forward focused compared to cdcc , i.e.  the slight shift observed in ( right ) increases at low energy .",
    "angular distribution computed for the breakup of c on pb at @xmath8mev using cdcc ( solid line ) and dea ( dashed line ) .",
    "a semiclassical correction ( dash - dotted line ) corrects perfectly the dea @xcite.,width=264 ]    as analysed in , this is due to the lack of coulomb deflection of the eikonal approximation . indeed , the factorisation somehow forces the projectile to move forward along a straight line , leading it into the high - field zone of the target .",
    "the predicted breakup cross section is hence too large and focused too forward in angle as compared to the case in which the coulomb deflection off the target is properly taken into account .",
    "this does not happen within cdcc , which naturally includes this deflection .",
    "analysing this effect in more detail in , we have observed that a simple semi - classical approximation @xcite corrects efficiently the eikonal framework for its lack of coulomb deflection . in that correction ,",
    "the norm of the transverse component @xmath37 of @xmath38 is replaced by the distance of closest approached @xmath40 between the projectile and the target on a classical coulomb trajectory .",
    "the resulting dea calculation is now in perfect agreement with the cdcc calculation ( see dash - dotted line in ) .",
    "this shows that the range of validity of the dea can be reliably extended down to low energy",
    "albeit accurate , the aforementioned models rely on several inputs , including the optical potentials used to simulate the interaction between the projectile components and the target .",
    "as shown in , the uncertainty related to this interaction can climb up to a factor 2 in the breakup cross section .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath21 , which is usually poorly known since the core of the nucleus is often itself radioactive .    to circumvent this problem , a new reaction observable",
    "has been suggested @xcite .",
    "it consists of the ratio of angular distributions for different processes , e.g. elastic scattering and breakup . within the recoil excitation and breakup model ( reb ) ,",
    "these distributions elegantly factorise into an elastic scattering cross section for a pointlike projectile and a form factor that accounts for the extension of the halo @xcite : & = & |f_00|^2()_pt [ e11 ] for the elastic scattering cross section , with the form factor |f_00|^2=_m_0 ||_l_0m_0(e_0,r)|^2e^id|^2 , [ e12 ] where @xmath41 is proportional to the exchanged momentum .",
    "for breakup at energy @xmath18 in the @xmath10-@xmath11 continuum , one obtains @xcite & = &    _",
    "l_0m_0(e_0,r ) e^id|^2 .",
    "[ e14 ] since the pointlike cross section is the same in both factorisations and , taking the ratio of these angular distributions should remove most of the angular dependence and lead to an observable that depends only on the projectile wave functions",
    ". however , the reb is based on two simplifying assumptions : it assumes the adiabatic approximation and it neglects @xmath22 .",
    "to check these predictions we perform dea calculations , which accounts for the dynamics of the projectile , includes the @xmath11-@xmath20 interaction , and is in excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "various tests have shown that it was best to consider the following ratio @xcite d_bu / d_sum&&|f_e0|^2 [ e15 ] with the summed cross section corresponding to all elastic , inelastic and breakup processes & = & + + de .",
    "[ e16 ]    the results of these tests are displayed in for be impinging on pb at @xmath42mev ( left ) and on c at @xmath43mev ( right ) @xcite . this figure shows the breakup cross section ( expressed in b / mev sr , dashed lines ) , the summed cross section ( as a ratio to rutherford , dotted lines ) , and their ratio ( solid lines ) .",
    "we observe that although both collisions are dominated by very different processes and that , accordingly , their cross sections are very different , the ratio of the dea cross sections is very smooth , nearly free from any oscillatory pattern , confirming that the ratio removes most of the dependence on the reaction process .",
    "ratio method illustrated for the collision of be on pb at @xmath42mev ( left ) and on c at @xmath43mev ( right ) .",
    "although the reaction process is very different in each reaction , the ratio   are nearly identical and in excellent agreement with the reb prediction.,width=253 ]    moreover , in both cases it is in excellent agreement with the reb form factor ( thick grey line ) , showing that the ratio provides information about the projectile structure free from any reaction artefact , contrarily to usual reaction observables .",
    "the ratio is especially sensitive to the @xmath10-@xmath11 binding energy and the partial wave of the projectile ground state @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have tested the validity of the ratio down to low energy .",
    "very surprisingly our calculations have shown that the method remains valid at low energy , especially on light targets @xcite .",
    "this analysis is illustrated in for be impinging on c at @xmath8mev .",
    "extension of the ratio method down to low energy ( @xmath8mev ) for be on c. results obtained with different potentials ( solid lines and dash - dotted lines ) lead to identical ratios.,width=298 ]    here again the ratio   removes most of the angular dependence leading to an observable in excellent agreement with the reb prediction , even though this beam energy is outside the range of validity of that model .",
    "the figure shows also results obtained with different @xmath21 .",
    "as observed in , they produce significantly different cross sections . however , the corresponding ratios are nearly identical .",
    "these preliminary results confirm the power of the ratio method in the analysis of the nuclear structure away from stability .",
    "nuclear reactions like elastic scattering and breakup are useful tools to study exotic nuclear structure , such as halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "most current models are based on a three - body framework : a two - body projectile impinging on a structureless target .",
    "various techniques have been developed to solve the corresponding three - body equation . in this contribution , we have described two of them : cdcc @xcite and dea @xcite .",
    "their comparison shows that at intermediate energy , they provide similar results @xcite . at lower energy ,",
    "the eikonal approximation is no longer valid .",
    "however a simple semiclassical correction enables us to extend its domain of validity down to low energies @xcite .    to avoid the dependence of the reaction models to uncertain inputs such as optical potentials , a new reaction observable is suggested .",
    "it consists of the ratio of angular distributions for two different processes such as breakup and elastic scattering , which is predicted by the reb model @xcite to depend only on the projectile wave functions .",
    "precise reaction calculations confirm this hypothesis and show the high sensitivity of the ratio to the projectile structure compared to regular reaction observables @xcite .",
    "this suggests the ratio method to be a very powerful tool to study the structure of nuclei far from stability .",
