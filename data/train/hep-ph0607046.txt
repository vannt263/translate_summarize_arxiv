    "before beginning a discussion of shower monte carlo event generators , it is well to note that these programs are , for the most part , limited to leading order ( lo ) perturbative accuracy . on the other hand ,",
    "there are programs available for a variety of important processes that perform purely perturbative ( non - shower ) calculations to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy .",
    "although these programs have proved to be very useful , it is pertinent to ask why they can not tell the whole story .    for this purpose , consider the cross section to produce three jets in electron - positron annihilation ( using a suitable definition of what one means by a jet ) .",
    "the ratio of this cross section to the total cross section is the three - jet fraction , @xmath0 .",
    "now , @xmath0 is an infrared safe observable that is amenable to calculation at nlo accuracy .",
    "in such a calculation , the program produces simulated partonic events with three partons and others with four partons . in either case , if the parton momenta meet certain criteria , the event can be classified as a three jet event .",
    "let us look at this calculation and ask for each jet in each three jet event what the mass of the jet is .",
    "then we can plot the calculated probability of finding a jet in a given bin of jet mass @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the result of this calculation is shown in figure  [ fig : jetmass ] .",
    "we see that there are two problems .",
    "first , the cross section increases as @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : jetmass ] , the apparent increase is limited only by the finite bin size .",
    "second , the first bin reflects a large negative cross section .",
    "in fact , the cross section for producing a jet with @xmath4 is negative and infinite .",
    "clearly , this calculation is seriously at variance with the real world .",
    "only after we integrate over @xmath1 do we get a sensible answer .",
    "- 1.0 cm    - 0.5 cm    now let us look at what a parton shower monte carlo program does . in figure",
    "[ fig : jetmass2 ] , we see that the standard parton shower monte carlo program pythia @xcite produces a sensible result in which the distribution @xmath2 peaks at about 8 gev .",
    "this contrasts with the pure nlo prediction .",
    "clearly it would be best to keep the nlo accuracy for @xmath0 while at the same time fixing the internal structure of the jets to be more like what one gets in pythia .",
    "this can be done if one keeps track of what the parton shower algorithm does , expands the parton shower effects perturbatively , and subtracts the nlo contribution of the parton shower from the nlo term in the perturbative calculation .",
    "the result labeled nlo+ps+had combines the nlo calculation with pythia @xcite .",
    "we see that the result for @xmath2 closely follows the pure pythia result .",
    "i do not display it as a graph , but the result of this program for just @xmath0 closely follows the pure nlo result .",
    "the program just mentioned is for electron - positron annihilation to make three jets .",
    "for hadron - hadron collisions , programs for several important processes are available in the package mc@nlo@xcite .",
    "i will not say more about the technical methods involved in combining `` mc '' with `` nlo , '' but i will comment briefly on one further development later in this talk . in the rest of this talk ,",
    "i will mainly concentrate on leading order aspects of monte carlo event generators .",
    "- 1.0 cm    - 0.5 cm",
    "consider the parton shower picture of hadron - hadron scattering in which there is some sort of hard event , say jet production or squark - pair production .",
    "( i leave out the description of the `` underlying event '' that accompanies the hard scattering and i omit entirely the parton shower description of the soft - scattering events that make up most of the hadron - hadron scattering cross section . )",
    "the first thing to understand is that the parton shower description starts from the hard scattering and proceeds toward softer scatterings . for final state partons ,",
    "one is thus working forwards in time , but for the initial state partons one is working backwards in time .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : insideout ] . in the right hand part of the figure",
    ", @xmath5 is monte carlo time , for which @xmath6 represents the hardest interaction and @xmath7 as parton virtualities tend to zero .",
    "thus some of the lines in the right hand picture are moving backward in physical time .",
    "although the development of the parton shower description of hadron scattering dates from about 1980 @xcite , it was not until somewhat later that this backwards evolution scheme was developed @xcite .    1 cm    i should mention that in the description that i present here , shower evolution is organized according to a hardness measure like virtuality or the transverse momentum in a splitting .",
    "the important program herwig @xcite is organized differently , with splittings at the widest angles done first .",
    "i do not discuss the herwig scheme here .",
    "rather , the description here is more attuned to the program pythia @xcite .",
    "now let us think about soft gluon radiation .",
    "i consider three jet production in electron - positron annihilation as an example . at the born level ,",
    "one has a @xmath8 final state .",
    "the gluon is a color @xmath9 , but to leading order in an expansion in powers of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of colors , the gluon can be considered to be a @xmath12 state .",
    "then the outgoing quark and the @xmath13 part of the gluon constitute a @xmath12 dipole , while the outgoing antiquark and the @xmath14 part of the gluon constitute another @xmath12 dipole , as depicted in figure  [ fig : coherence ] .",
    "( these are `` dipoles '' in the sense that there is a color charge and an opposite color charge moving away from each other .",
    "however , the color charge separation is not small as in the traditional multipole approximation . )",
    "1 cm    the two dipoles will radiate soft gluons .",
    "given the ( approximate ) color structure , the two dipoles radiate independently : there is no quantum interference between a gluon radiation from one dipole and radiation from the other dipole . the radiation pattern is depicted in figure  [ fig : dipoleradiation ] . for each dipole , there is soft - collinear radiation that is concentrated in the directions of the two outgoing partons for that dipole .",
    "there is also a wider angle component that is , approximately , spread over the angular region between the parton directions .",
    "thus the wide angle dipole has soft radiation spread over a wide angular region while the narrow angle dipole has soft radiation spread over a narrow angular region .",
    "1 cm    in a parton shower monte carlo program , one can work to leading order in @xmath10 ( as parton shower programs generally do ) and make sure that the parton splitting formulas properly take into account the interference between gluons emitted from the two parts of a color dipole .",
    "the program ariadne is based on this kind of picture @xcite . the latest version of pythia is also based on a dipole picture @xcite .",
    "the present authors have found that the catani - seymour dipole formalism @xcite for generating the subtractions for perturbative nlo calculations is also quite useful as the basis for splittings in a parton shower @xcite .",
    "there is another way to do this .",
    "one can simply generate independent emissions from each parton and then impose a restriction on the angles of the emissions .",
    "this is the method of herwig @xcite . in herwig ,",
    "a wide angle soft gluon emission as depicted in the left - hand part of figure  [ fig : dipoleradiation ] is generated first , before the splitting of the quark into a hard quark and a hard gluon .",
    "the algorithm enforces that the angles between daughter partons in a splitting decrease for splittings generated later in the algorithm evolution .",
    "the recognition of the importance of this ordering was important in the development of parton shower algorithms @xcite .",
    "shower evolution can be represented using an evolution equation of the form @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a linear operator acting on a function @xmath17 giving the probability for having a given partonic state at evolution time @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 is the probability function for having a particular partonic state at a later evolution time @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution equation expresses @xmath21 as a sum of two terms . in the first term",
    ", the partonic state stays the same .",
    "this is represented as a no splitting operator @xmath22 that inserts a sudakov factor giving the probability that no splitting occurred between times @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "this factor is an exponential of minus the integral from @xmath18 to @xmath20 of the differential splitting probability . in the second term",
    ", there is a no splitting operator @xmath23 , followed by a splitting operator @xmath24 at time @xmath25 , followed by complete evolution @xmath26 for times after the splitting .",
    "there is an integration over the intermediate time @xmath25 at which the splitting occurs .",
    "the @xmath27 splitting operator @xmath24 uses an approximation to the qcd squared matrix element .",
    "this shower evolution can be represented graphically as in figure  [ fig : evolution ] .",
    "the ovals represent the complete shower evolution operator @xmath21 .",
    "the narrow rounded rectangles represent the sudakov operator @xmath28 .",
    "the splitting is represented by a small circle with one parton coming in and two partons going out .    to generate a cross section with a shower monte carlo event generator",
    ", one can start with a hard squared matrix element for @xmath29 scattering , then apply the shower operator to the two incoming and two outgoing partons .",
    "when the shower evolution equation is iterated , one obtains terms representing @xmath30 splittings with sudakov factors for the intervals with no splittings , as depicted in figure  [ fig : iterated ] .",
    "the standard shower depicted in figure  [ fig : iterated ] has a deficiency , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : deficiency ] .",
    "the left - hand picture depicts a term contributing to the standard shower . in this term",
    ", there are sudakov factors and @xmath27 parton splitting functions .",
    "if we omit the sudakov factors , we have the @xmath27 parton splittings as depicted in the middle picture . these splittings are approximations based on the splitting angles being small or one of the daughter partons having small momentum .",
    "thus the shower splitting probability with two splittings approximates the exact squared matrix element for @xmath31 scattering .",
    "the approximation is good in parts of the final state phase space , but not in all of it . thus one might want to replace the approximate squared matrix element of the middle picture with the exact squared matrix element of the right - hand picture .",
    "however , if we use the exact squared matrix element , we lack the sudakov factors .",
    "2 cm 2.5 cm    one can improve the approximation as illustrated in figure  [ fig : improved ] . we reweight the exact squared matrix element by the ratio of the shower approximation with sudakov factors to the shower approximation without sudakov factors .",
    "the idea is to insert the sudakov factors into the exact squared matrix element .",
    "this is the essential idea in the paper of catani , krauss , kuhn , and webber @xcite .",
    "they use the @xmath32 jet algorithm to define the ratio needed to calculate the sudakov reweighting factor .",
    "there is a further step in implementing this idea .",
    "ckkw divide the shower evolution into two stages , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a parameter that represents a moderate @xmath36 scale and @xmath37 represents the very small @xmath36 scale at which showers stop and hadronization is simulated .    with this division",
    ", the sudakov reweighting can be performed for the part of the shower at scale harder than @xmath35 , as depicted in figure  [ fig : ckkw ] .",
    "the first term has no splittings at scale harder than @xmath35 . in the second term",
    "there is one splitting , generated via the exact matrix element with a sudakov correction as discussed above . in the next term",
    "there are two splittings .",
    "if we suppose that we do not have exact matrix elements for more than @xmath31 partons , states at scale @xmath35 with more partons are generated with the ordinary parton shower .",
    "however , this contribution is suppressed by factors of @xmath38 .",
    "evolution from @xmath35 to @xmath37 is done via the ordinary shower algorithm .    to state the main idea of this jet number matching in a little different language",
    ", we can consider the cross section for an observable @xmath39 . in the ckkw method",
    ", we break @xmath40 $ ] into a sum of contributions @xmath41 $ ] from final states with @xmath42 jets at resolution scale @xmath35",
    ". then @xmath41 $ ] is evaluated using the exact tree level matrix element for @xmath43 parton scattering , supplemented by sudakov reweighting and further supplemented by showering of the @xmath44 partons at scales softer than @xmath35 . if @xmath39 is an infrared safe observable , this method gets @xmath41 $ ] correct to the leading perturbative order , @xmath45 .",
    "the method can be extended .",
    "the present authors have shown ( at least for the case of electron - positron annihilation ) how to get @xmath41 $ ] for an infrared safe observable correct to next - to - leading order , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the required nlo adjustments are a little complicated , so i do not discuss them here .",
    "there is an alternative way to organize the shower improvement so as to include exact tree level matrix elements @xcite . one does not really need to split the evolution at a scale @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that one has the exact tree level matrix elements for @xmath47 partons for @xmath48 .",
    "then the partonic cross section at a final very soft scale @xmath37 before hadronization is the sum of the @xmath29 , @xmath49 , ",
    "@xmath50 cross sections with sudakov factors plus one more term , which is the most important term . in the last term",
    ", we have the sudakov improved @xmath50 squared matrix element in which the softest splitting has scale @xmath5 and we integrate over @xmath5 .",
    "this is convoluted with the simple shower approximation for splittings softer than @xmath5 , down all the way to @xmath37 .",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ fig : ckkwalt ] .",
    "the terms before the last one are included in the calculation but are not important because they contain the sudakov suppression for only a small number of splittings to occur down to a very soft scale @xmath37 . in the term that really matters ,",
    "we use the sudakov improved @xmath50 squared matrix element with an arbitrary number of further splittings generated in the collinear / soft approximation , all of this with sudakov suppression factors .",
    "parton shower event generators have proved to be an essential tool for particle physics .",
    "these tools have been undergoing substantial improvement in recent years .",
    "there are quite a number of very good people working on this subject and some of the most recent progress will be reported at this conference .",
