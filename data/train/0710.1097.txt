    "dwarf novae  a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars ",
    "are quite well studied interacting binary systems composed of late - type red dwarf secondary and white dwarf primary stars ( warner 1995 , hellier 2001 ) .",
    "matter transferred from the red dwarf forms an accretion disc around the white dwarf .",
    "although in the last decade significant progress has been made in explaining the behaviour of dwarf novae light curves , some physical processes ongoing in these systems are still not fully understood ( see for example smak 2000 , schreiber and lasota 2007 ) . in particular , the thermal - tidal instability model of osaki ( 1996 , 2005 ) describing the phenomenon of superoutbursts and superhumps may be tested by examination of su uma - type dwarf novae light curves .",
    "additionally , objects near and inside the so called period gap are very important from an evolutionary point of view .",
    "those systems give us an unprecedented opportunity to study the evolution of dwarf novae .",
    "v419 lyr is a poorly studied cataclysmic variable discovered by kurochkin ( 1990 ) and originally classified as a z cam - type dwarf nova .",
    "later , nogami et al . ( 1998 ) caught this object in outburst and found superhumps in its light curve .",
    "detection of superhumps together with characteristic properties of the outburst allowed them to classify v419 lyr as a su uma - type dwarf nova , but short coverage of the eruption did not allow accurate determination of the superhump period .",
    "nevertheless , there was a strong suggestion that v419 lyr has one of the longest orbital periods known among su uma variables .",
    "this object has been monitored at various photometric bands by the variable star network ( vsnet ) ( see for example kato et al .",
    "the observations from that program enabled a tentative determination of the supercycle period to be about @xmath4 days ( katysheva and pavlenko 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , morales - rueda and marsh ( 2002 ) obtained a spectrum of v419 lyr during outburst showing a relatively broad absorption feature around 430 - 440 nm .    in this work we present an analysis of photometric data collected during the 2006 july superoutburst of v419 lyr .",
    "the data are much richer than previous studies and provide us with an opportunity to determine parameters describing this system more precisely .",
    "the curious variable experiment ( curve ) team ( see for example olech et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) , alerted by the vsnet mailing list , found v419 lyr in a very bright state on 2006 july 17/18 .",
    "subsequently the object was monitored on 13 consecutive nights ( with a gap on july 24/25 ) until its return to quiescence on august 2/3 .",
    "the observations were performed using a 0.6-m cassegrain telescope equipped with a tektronix tk512cb back - illuminated ccd camera .",
    "the image scale was @xmath5pixel providing a @xmath6 field of view ( udalski and pych , 1992 )    observations were made unfiltered for two reasons .",
    "first , due to lack of an autoguiding system , we wished to keep exposures short in order to minimize guiding errors .",
    "second , because our main goal was analysis of the temporal behaviour of the light curve , the use of filters might cause the object to be too faint to observe in quiescence .",
    "exposure times were 90 seconds during the bright state and 100 - 150 seconds at minimum light .",
    "all curve team data reductions were performed using a standard procedure based on iraf package and the profile photometry has been derived using the daophotii package ( stetson 1987 ) .    during preliminary analysis of the data we found the aavso archive containing several ccd observations of the same superoutburst of v419 lyr made by observers from england ( d.b . ) and the united states ( r.k . ) .",
    "therefore we decided to combine our data to obtain better results .",
    "d.b . used a 0.35-m meade schmidt - cassegrain telescope with a starlight xpress sxv - h9 ccd camera .",
    "data were taken unfiltered .",
    "exposures were 40 , 50 or 60 sec depending on conditions .",
    "the aip4win package ( berry and burnell 2000 ) was used to dark - subtract and flat - field all images before measuring them using aperture photometry .",
    "the magnitude of v419 lyr was determined by differential photometry with respect to an ensemble of two nearby comparison stars .",
    "r.k . used 0.25-m meade lx-200 schmidt - cassegrain telescope equipped with an apogee ap-47 ccd camera and clear filter characterized by ir block at 700 nm .",
    "mpo canopus software ( warner 2007 ) was used for differential photometry of the variable with an average of four comparison stars .",
    "table 1 presents a journal of our ccd observations of v419 lyr . in total",
    ", we observed the star for more than 48 hours on 14 nights and collected 3179 exposures .",
    "figure 1 presents the photometric behaviour of v419 lyr in 2006 july and august .",
    "dots and open circles correspond to our ccd observations and visual estimates of aavso observers , respectively .",
    "the shape of the light curve corresponds to the standard picture of a superoutburst .",
    "first , the star rose rapidly from its quiescent level to a peak magnitude of around 14.5 mag . due to the lack of observations , the exact time of the rise",
    "is unknown .",
    "v419 lyr was seen by aavso observers in a bright state on july 16 .",
    "two nights later , during our first run , the star was still at the same brightness and showing fully developed superhumps with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.3 mag - a feature characteristic of the beginning of a superoutburst .",
    "thus we conclude that the july 2006 superoutburst started around july 15 .    after reaching peak magnitude ,",
    "v419 lyr entered the plateau stage lasting about 11 days with an average decline rate of about 0.1 mag d@xmath7 .",
    "the plateau stage ended rapidly on july 27 and during the next two days we observed the final decline stage with a change of brightness of about 1 mag d@xmath7 . on july 30 the star was again in quiescence showing a mean brightness of 18.1 mag .",
    "thus the entire superoutburst lasted about 15 days .",
    "the linear fit to the plateau stage in figure 1 is helpful in showing there was no rebrightening as has been observed in some su uma systems ( kato et al .",
    "figure 2 shows the light curves of v419 lyr during thirteen individual nights .",
    "filled circles correspond to the ostrowik observatory data , while open circles and squares represent d.b . and r.k .",
    "measurements respectively .",
    "the magnitudes have been transformed to a common @xmath8 system and detrended for purposes of fourier power spectrum analysis .",
    "the superhumps are clearly visible and have an initial amplitude of 0.3 mag",
    ". later the superhump amplitude gradually decreases and on august 2/3 is practically indistinguishable from noise .",
    "as we noted earlier , all light curves of v419 lyr in superoutburst were detrended by removing a fit based on a first or second order polynomial .",
    "then we analyzed them using anova statistics ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting periodogram is shown in figure 3 .",
    "it shows a very clear and dominant peak at frequency @xmath9 c / d , which we interpret as due to superhumps and corresponds to the period @xmath10 days .",
    "the spectrum has almost no 1-day aliases due to good coverage and the use of data from three sites - two from europe and one from the united states .",
    "a small peak is also observed around 22 c / d , the first harmonic of the main frequency .",
    "we then prewhitened the light curve of v419 lyr during the superoutburst with the main period and its first harmonic .",
    "the power spectrum of the resulting light curve shows no other periodicities .      to check the stability of the superhump period and to better determine its value",
    ", we constructed an @xmath11 diagram . because the maxima in our case were almost always clearly visible and easier to measure than minima",
    ", we decided to use the timings of the former .",
    "finally , we were able to determine 27 times of maxima which are listed in table 2 together with associated errors , cycle numbers @xmath12 , and @xmath11 values .",
    ".times of maxima observed in the light curve of v419 lyr during its 2006 superoutburst [ cols=\">,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     a least - squares linear fit to the data taken during the plateau phase of superoutburst gives the following ephemeris for the maxima :    @xmath13    the above equation indicates that the mean superhump period was @xmath14 days , which agrees within errors with the determination based on anova statistics .",
    "combining these two measurements gives us our final estimate of the mean superhump period of v419 lyr during its 2006 july superoutburst which is @xmath15 days ( @xmath2 min ) .",
    "the @xmath11 values computed according to the ephemeris ( 1 ) are listed in table 2 and also shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is clear that v419 lyr , during its 2006 superoutburst , showed clear changes of superhump period . in the cycle range @xmath16 the period was quickly decreasing .",
    "a second - order polynomial fit to @xmath17 dependence in this range corresponds to the solid line in the bottom panel of figure 4 and is expressed by the following ephemeris :    @xmath18    this equation indicates that the period derivative has the large value @xmath3 .",
    "this is the second largest negative value detected in su uma stars .",
    "figure 5 , taken from kato et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and olech et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , shows the position of v419 lyr on the @xmath19 diagram .",
    "only kk tel had a faster period decrease during its 2002 june superoutburst ( kato et al .",
    "it is interesting that both v419 lyr and kk tel are long superhump period dwarf novae with orbital periods very close or even within the period gap .",
    "it is worth commenting on the behaviour of the superhump period after cycle number @xmath20 . at that moment ,",
    "the star was still in the plateau phase of the superoutburst , three days before entering the final decline , and superhumps were still clearly visible in the light curve .",
    "the @xmath11 values for cycle numbers from 70 to 111 can be roughly fitted with a straight line , which indicates that the period decrease had stopped and its value stabilized at @xmath21 days .    the noisy maxima with cycle numbers above 120",
    "are shifted by @xmath22 cycle with respect to the superhump maxima from earlier nights .",
    "this indicates that they may be connected with late superhumps or even with the orbital wave .",
    "it is interesting that our @xmath11 diagram could be also interpreted in diffrent way than `` common superhump followed by transition to late superhump '' scenario .",
    "fitting a 5th order polynomial to the moments of maxima appears to work with the data about as well as a quadratic followed by a linear trend as described previously .",
    "we are not arguing in favour of this interpretation , simply saying that there might be other interpretations of the data .",
    "the upper panel of figure 4 shows the evolution of the amplitude of superhumps through the entire superoutburst . in a typical su uma star ,",
    "fully developed superhumps have an amplitude of about 0.3 mag and a characteristic tooth shape .",
    "interestingly , these properties seem to be completely independent of the inclination of the orbit of the binary .",
    "as the outburst progresses , the amplitude gradually decreases and the profile of the humps changes . a few days after maximum , so called secondary humps or interpulses become visible . in the beginning they are small but with time they may become as high as the main maxima - most probably evolving towards late superhumps .",
    "v419 lyr is an interesting case because it seems not to follow this scenario . on the nights of july 19/20 and 20/21 it clearly showed double maxima .",
    "however , these quickly disappeared . during subsequent nights",
    "there was hardly a trace of secondary humps .",
    "very weak humps could be seen only on july 23/24 and 25/26 and quite strong ones on july 27/28 .",
    "we were curious about the reason for such behaviour .",
    "the only property which strongly differs in v419 lyr from typical su uma stars is its long superhump / orbital period placing it within the period gap .",
    "we therefore reviewed the literature to investigate the occurrence of secondary humps among long period systems ( i.e. with superhump period @xmath23 days ) .",
    "the summary of our review is given in table 3 .",
