    "in 1988 , r.b . laughlin wrote about high @xmath0 superconductors : `` the systems in question are inherently magnetic .",
    "stoichiometric la@xmath5cuo@xmath3 is an ordered spin-1/2 antiferromagnet and an insulator .",
    "doping the material by substituting sr for about 3% of the la destroys the magnetic order [ ... ] .",
    "it is hard to understand how doping at this level could have destroyed all the spins .",
    "a more reasonable guess is that the extra holes make ordering more difficult , and that the spins are still present in some sort of quantum spin liquid state ''  @xcite .    for a number of years thereafter ,",
    "experimental studies failed to establish a consensus on whether localized spins indeed survived in metallic samples , possibly in a kind of spin - liquid state , or whether correlation effects in a metal were sufficient to explain the observed magnetic fluctuations . despite much evidence that the superconducting phase retains some memory of the af one  @xcite",
    ", some considered that tangible signs of localized spins were lacking for superconducting concentrations ( @xmath6 in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ) : nel order was rather far away ( @xmath7 ) and not much attention was paid to the frozen magnetic state for @xmath8 .",
    "understanding of this issue has evolved since the discovery of charge stripes in la@xmath9nd@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath3  @xcite and related compounds  @xcite . in this class of materials , self - organization of the doped holes into linear ribbons",
    "leads to _ long range magnetic order _ in the hole - depleted regions , even for hole doping close to the optimal value for superconductivity ( @xmath1215 % ) . this spectacular `` reappearance '' of the spins",
    "was known before tranquada s experiment , but the discovery of stripes renewed interest in magnetic order , and contributed to the view of high-@xmath0 materials as doped antiferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "this paper is a short review on magnetic order in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  superconductors .",
    "these represent a particularly interesting case , because they lie in between the ltt materials  @xcite , where superconductivity is severely suppressed , and higher @xmath0 systems such as ybco where magnetic order is less obvious .",
    "there are many reports of magnetic order coexisting with superconductivity in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , starting with kitazawa  in 1988  @xcite .",
    "these results did not attract significant attention mostly because doubts were raised concerning the homogeneity of the samples , and because la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  was considered as an atypical member of the high-@xmath0 family .",
    "this issue was reopened around 1998  @xcite and most of the previous results were confirmed quantitatively .",
    "figure  1 shows most of the data available in the literature ( to the author s knowledge ) , for the magnetic transition temperature @xmath13 obtained from muon spin rotation ( @xmath14sr ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) in superconducting  @xcite and non - superconducting samples  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this selective presentation of the magnetic resonance data is twofold : numerous studies can be found in the literature which are lower - energy probes than neutron scattering ( ns ) . because the ns signal is quasi - elastic rather than purely elastic",
    "( the integration window is usually not less than 0.5mev ) , and freezing of the moments is gradual in these compounds , the apparent onset of magnetic order occurs at higher @xmath15 for ns than for magnetic resonance .",
    "ns studies of magnetic order in superconducting la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic resonance techniques can be considered as true low - energy probes : in the non - superconducting phase ( @xmath16 ) , the transition temperature @xmath13 , defined at their time scale , is indeed very close ( typically 1  k ) to the @xmath13 inferred from squid measurements  @xcite , which are almost static .",
    "the main features of the magnetic phase diagram on fig .  1 can be summarized as follows :    @xmath17 the agreement between the data is good , and there is no doubt that the magnetic phase for @xmath16 continues far into the superconducting region .",
    "magnetic order thus coexists with superconductivity in underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath17 except at the point where the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 lines cross , nowhere in the phase diagram does the magnetic transition coincide with the onset for superconductivity ( see the discussion in  @xcite for the explanation of earlier confusion on this point ) .",
    "@xmath17 magnetic order seems to persist at very low @xmath15 for @xmath20  @xcite , and up to @xmath21  @xcite , although there is not full agreement on this issue  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 some scatter in the data can be seen around @xmath4 .",
    "for example , a @xmath14sr study detects the appearance of frozen moments near 20  k in la@xmath22sr@xmath11cuo@xmath3  @xcite , while an nmr study in a very similar single crystal , defines @xmath23  k as the @xmath15 at which the _ average _ relaxation rate @xmath24 is maximum  @xcite . if the volume fraction of magnetic order grows on cooling down ( distribution of @xmath13 values ) , the discrepancy between the criteria is not surprising .",
    "in addition , the strong @xmath25 dependence of @xmath13 around @xmath4 may contribute to the scatter between data from different samples , and the somewhat higher energy scale of @xmath14sr with respect to nmr may become noticeable since @xmath13 is higher .",
    "@xmath17 in any event , there is a clear _ enhancement of @xmath13 around @xmath4 _ , coinciding with a slight suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests the same 1/8 anomaly as in ltt species , although with the following differences : superconductivity is only weakly affected here ( note however that a few la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  samples around @xmath4 have an anomalously low @xmath0 , which is yet to be understood  @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum of @xmath13 seems to be occur around @xmath26 - 0.12 rather than at @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath17 the overall magnetic phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 is similar to that of ltt la@xmath28eu@xmath29sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  @xcite , but the peak of @xmath13 around @xmath4 is much narrower in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "this makes a clearer distinction between the behavior close to @xmath4 , and the monotonic decrease of @xmath19 for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath17 for @xmath31 , characteristic features of spin - glasses ( in the loose sense : these features are also seen in diluted antiferromagnets ) are observed in the bulk magnetization  @xcite .",
    "because of the meissner effect , no such study could be performed in superconducting samples .",
    "however , the continuous decrease of @xmath13 from @xmath32 up to @xmath33 suggests that the magnetic state is similar on both sides of the non - superconductor to superconductor transition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14sr",
    "@xcite and nmr  @xcite show that sizeable disorder ( spatial inhomogeneity ) in both the spin dynamics and the static local magnetization also exists for @xmath34 .",
    "the slowing down of magnetic fluctuations is also similar above and below @xmath35 , and is more gradual than for a conventional 3d nel transition . magnetic order is thus considered to have some glassy character in superconducting samples , and the transition temperature is usually called @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath17 the frozen magnetic state between @xmath32 and @xmath33 has been named a cluster spin - glass , in order to reconcile the glassy features with the existence of domains of staggered magnetization  @xcite .",
    "it has also been clear that some kind of charge segregation / order is necessary in order to explain the existence of frozen af clusters at concentrations as high as @xmath1212% .",
    "however , it was recently shown that the frozen state could actually be described as diagonal ( with respect to cu - o bonds ) stripes for @xmath36  @xcite , within the neutron scattering time window , collinear stripes for @xmath37  @xcite , and the coexistence of both around @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the existence of magnetic stripes explains the af domains of the cluster spin - glass , but it does not allow one to deduce whether all of the spatial inhomogeneity is due to the stripe pattern or whether additional phenomena , such as phase separation between striped and non - striped regions , take place .",
    "@xmath17 the magnetic order in question is not magnetic - field induced .",
    "lake  observe an enhancement of the bragg peak intensity by applying a field , and a change in its @xmath15 dependence , but magnetic order at @xmath33 is known to exist even in zero field both from measurements by the same authors  @xcite , and from earlier studies  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for @xmath4 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath15 at which a neutron diffraction signal appears does not seem to vary with the field  @xcite , and that no strong modification of slowing - down with the field could be detected in nmr  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 the magnetic correlation length at low @xmath15 is shortest around @xmath35 ( @xmath38  20   ) and has a strong peak around @xmath4 ( @xmath39  200   )  @xcite , where stripes are actually slanted  @xcite . the ordered moment decreases with @xmath25 up to @xmath40 but it seems to be enhanced at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a recent @xmath14sr study for @xmath4 indicates that the frozen magnetic regions represent not more that 18 % of the sample volume , at low@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this immediately raises the question of the intrinsic character of the magnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "savici  propose that there is phase separation between regions with ( striped ) magnetic order and superconducting regions without magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "alternative and/or complementary explanations should however be considered .",
    "first , there is evidence that local ltt distortions exist in the lto phase  @xcite of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  @xcite . as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , this should cause local pinning of stripes , and thus nucleate magnetic order .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is only weakly affected in la@xmath22sr@xmath11cuo@xmath3 and the absence of a 1/8-anomaly for @xmath13 in a y - doped bi2212",
    "@xcite , a material which does not show the ltt instability , could support this hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is that the magnetic fraction at the @xmath14sr time scale is reduced by rapid spin flips .",
    "these spin flips might be produced by transverse stripe fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to remark that in ltt species , where stripes are supposedly more static , there is already evidence for substantial averaging of the local magnetization at the nmr time scale  @xcite ; a magnetic volume fraction of 100% is observed at @xmath4 , but it is reduced by _ half _ at @xmath20  @xcite . at present",
    "it is thus unclear whether the @xmath13 anomaly and the reduced magnetic fraction in @xmath14sr for @xmath41 in  la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  are intrinsic or if they are related to extra pinning by lattice distortions in some parts of the sample .",
    "all studies to date and the good agreement between data sets from many different samples , point to the existence of bulk superconductivity in these systems , except close to the onset value @xmath43 and possibly at @xmath4 ( this case is not clear )  @xcite .",
    "note that these studies ascertain that the samples studied by nmr or @xmath14sr are representative of superconducting la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , but they do not rule out the existence of normal regions and/or unpaired carriers .    in conclusion , coexistence of magnetic order with superconductivity is intrinsic in a significant part of the phase diagram of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 . since these are bulk phases , without any hint of macroscopic phase separation , the coexistence has to occur on a small length scale .",
    "nevertheless , the data discussed here do not seem to provide firm answers to crucial questions  @xcite : is the stripe picture able to account alone for the coexistence  ?",
    "is there a strong hybridization between the magnetic and the superconducting entities or should they be considered as distinct phases  ?",
    "more generally , which ingredients make the coexistence possible : spatial segregation , different orbitals ( cu and o ) , different energy scales , etc .  ?",
    "for instance in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 : d. c. johnston , phys .",
    "* 62 * ( 1989 ) 957 ; t. imai , phys .",
    "* 70 * ( 1993 ) 1002 ; p. carretta , eur .",
    "j. b * 10 * ( 1999 ) 233 ; k. yamada , j. phys .",
    "* 64 * ( 1995 ) 2742 .",
    "the main difference between `` regular '' la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  and la@xmath44(nd , eu)@xmath45sr@xmath46cuo@xmath3 or la@xmath1ba@xmath46cuo@xmath3 , is that the crystallographic structure of the former is orthorhombic at low @xmath15 ( lto ) in most of the relevant doping range , while it is tetragonal ( ltt phase ) in the latter .",
    "the two phases correspond to two directions of the planar - oxygen buckling pattern , which differ by 45@xmath47 .",
    "this result might appear to contradict the absence of any nmr signal with a distinct , longer , @xmath48 that could be expected from sizeable non - frozen regions  @xcite .",
    "however , nmr can not exclude that such an nmr signal is hidden by spin diffusion processes which homogeneizes the @xmath48 of the nuclei outside frozen areas with that of nuclei inside .",
    "oscillation of an o - centered stripe across a cu site averages the magnetic moment on this site to zero , on a time scale which is long compared to the jump frequency .",
    "this moment is only reduced by a factor 2 for cu - centered stripes .",
    "i thank s. kivelson for pointing out this distinction ."
