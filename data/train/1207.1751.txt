    "the flow of granular materials in bins and hoppers is of great practical interest in connection with the handling and transportation of bulk solids such as sand , coal , ore and grain .",
    "it has been extensively studied for several decades and generated a significant number of publications with earlier results summarized in monographs  @xcite , and review articles  @xcite . with advances in experimental techniques and computational power , recent results using particle image velocimetry ( piv )",
    "@xcite and discrete element method ( dem )  @xcite have shed light on flow kinematics and on particle - property effects on the flow behavior .",
    "the understanding also drives the development of continuum theories  @xcite , which are necessary for predicting industry - scale hopper flow .    in spite of the extensive research ,",
    "a continuum model capable of accurately predicting realistic hopper - flow behavior is still under development .",
    "for example , the challenges faced in the constitutive modelling of hopper flow were described in  @xcite ; deficiencies of a mohr - coulomb plasticity theory were summarized in  @xcite .",
    "the deficiencies of current models are also reflected in the fact that widely different predictions of well - defined silo flow were made using different models  @xcite . precisely due to these difficulties",
    ", the hopper - flow problem also serves as a stringent benchmark case to test newly - developed theories for granular materials , such as the stochastic flow - rule  @xcite , non - local hypoplasticity  @xcite and elasto - plastic models  @xcite .    in this paper , we employ a new constitutive model with microstructure evolution  @xcite to predict flow in a conical hopper .",
    "we utilize the radial solution , first presented by jenike  @xcite , to reduce the number of spatial variables to one by the inherent symmetry .",
    "such a solution , albeit being rather simplified , helps to elucidate the essential capabilities of the constitutive model and prevents obscuring the features by complexities in boundary conditions and numerical methods .",
    "we will demonstrate that the model is capable of predicting a varying stress ratio along the flow path , which is realistic but elusive in previous theories .",
    "we will show how the particle properties and microstructure are linked to the continuum variables , which enables studying the role of such microscopic parameters at a much lower computational cost .",
    "we will also compare the predictions to dem simulation results and the so - called hour - glass theory ( hgt )  @xcite that is also a radial - flow solution , but employing the mohr - coulomb plasticity theory .",
    "the remaining part is organized as follows ; the hopper - flow model is described in section  [ sec : model ] detailing the governing equations  ( [ sec : gov ] ) and the constitutive model  ( [ sec : const ] ) .",
    "the results from solving the model are presented and analyzed in section  [ sec : res ] , leading to the conclusions and future work in section  [ sec : conc ] . regarding notation",
    ", we employ lightface italics for scalars , the boldface regular font for vectors and the san serif font for the second - order tensors .",
    "we consider an incompressible cohesionless granular material of mass density @xmath0 and volume fraction @xmath1 discharging from a narrow - angled conical hopper of half angle @xmath2 , whose geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "we use a spherical coordinate system ( ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) ) with origin at the virtual apex of the hopper .",
    "the walls are assumed to be rigid and smooth .",
    "since the angle @xmath2 is small , gravity is assumed to be in the radial direction . by axial symmetry , the shear stress @xmath6 is reasonably assumed to be zero .",
    "we further assume that the velocity is radial and independent of @xmath4 and @xmath5 coordinates .    with these conditions , the continuity equation for this incompressible granular flow",
    "is reduced to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive flow rate independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this flow rate is related to the discharge mass flow rate @xmath9 , as @xmath10 .",
    "we then obtain a dimensionless momentum conservation equation utilizing eq .",

    "solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : mom1 ] with appropriate boundary conditions predicts the radial distributions of velocity and stress as well as the flow rate .",
    "however , this equation is not closed and a constitutive model for the stress is necessary .",
    "we will present the model employed in this study in the next section .",
    "we briefly present the constitutive model in its general form for completeness .",
    "readers are referred to  @xcite for details on the derivation and characteristics of the model . in this model ,",
    "the stress is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pressure or mean normal stress , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the deviatoric and full strain rate tensors , respectively , i.e.  @xmath21 , @xmath22 is a scalar macroscopic friction coefficient and @xmath23 is the identity tensor .",

    "this means @xmath60 since the fabric tensor is defined as being traceless .",
    "the fabric evolution equation is thus simplified to @xmath61 the boundary condition of @xmath62 at the top surface of radius @xmath63 ( see fig .  [",

    "[ eq : eta_linear ] , we obtain @xmath64 similarly with the stress eq .",
    "[ eq : augment_stress_a6 ] , we have the stress components @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a bulk friction coefficient defined as the ratio of ( von mises ) shear stress to pressure and @xmath67 the bulk friction coefficient can thus be calculated from fabric and particle friction and need not be taken as a constant as in many plasticity theories .",
    "defining the relation between the stress components as @xmath68 , we then get the stress ratio @xmath69 it can be seen that the relation between the stress components is derived from the stress equation given the fabric and flow conditions .",

    "we note that the free - fall arch concept is echoed by the force - chain idea in recent granular material research .",
    "such arch can be seen from the visualization of force chains in the dem simulation of a flat - bottom silo  @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eq : mom ] is closed by the constitutive relations eqs .",
    "[ eq : arr][eq : k ] and specific solutions can be obtained applying the boundary conditions . the pressure and @xmath24 evolution equations are redundant for incompressible flow , as evidenced from the above derivation process",

    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] .",
    "the present theory predicts that the normal - stress ratio @xmath72 increases along the flow direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] ( a ) ) , which naturally arises from the variation of the fabric ( i.e.  @xmath73 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the value @xmath73 increases along the flow , indicating microstructure anisotropy increased due to large deformation . as prescribed in eq .",
    "[ eq : eta ] , the increase of @xmath73 results in the increase in @xmath22 along the flow direction , which in turn increases the @xmath72 values according to eq .",
    "[ eq : k ] .",
    "the nsd effect further couples the @xmath73 variation to @xmath72 , reflected in eq .  [ eq : mub ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] ( a ) , the formulation with the nsd leads to smaller @xmath72 values , @xmath74 at the bottom , comparing to @xmath75 calculated without the nsd .",
    "in contrast , a constant @xmath72 is prescribed by the mohr - coulomb yield criterion together with the incipient - yield - everywhere assumption , which was employed in many previous hopper - flow analyses  ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? *",
    "more references therein ) , and simulations  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference in the present constitutive model is that the @xmath72 value , a bulk level property , need not be specified _ a priori _ ; but is calculated from the particle - level property , @xmath36 , and the microstructure evolution .",
    "another distinction has to be made from the constant @xmath72 used in pressure analysis for a static granular column , which appears to be a reasonable assumption in the static condition , as seen in janssen s analysis  @xcite and verified more recently by an elasticity theory  @xcite .",
    "this comparison highlights the fact that the stress state in the flow is different from that in the static condition .    to compare these continuum results with dem ones ,",
    "we calculate an internal friction coefficient @xmath76 , using the same definition as in a dem study of two - dimensional hopper flow  @xcite .",
    "this coefficient is related to the stress ratio @xmath72 as @xmath77 . the value of @xmath76 increases from @xmath78 at the top to @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) at the bottom for the case without ( with ) the nsd as plotted in fig  [ fig : stress_mu03](c ) .",
    "this variation agrees with that of @xmath81@xmath82 from the dem simulation for a hopper with @xmath83 discharging polydisperse particles of @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "we note that it is reasonable to compare to the polydisperse system simulated as the monodisperse system formed hexagonal crystalline structures  @xcite , which is not consistant with the physical basis of the current constitutive model and not realistic for practical hopper flows .",
    "this trend of internal friction increasing from top to bottom is also supported by dem simulations of cylindrical flat - bottom silos  @xcite , where the ratios between the reported shear and normal stresses varied in a similar fashion .",
    "however , no quantitative comparison can be made due to the lack of principal stress data and the different geometry used in  @xcite .",
    "with support from the dem simulations , our results confirm that the new constitutive model has advantages in predicting realistic characteristics of stress in the conical hopper flow .",
    "predictions of normal stress @xmath84 from the present formulations with and without the nsd effect and from the hgt are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] ( d ) .",
    "the hgt uses a constant @xmath72 equal to the mean of the @xmath72 values from the calculation with nsd .",
    "the profiles of @xmath84 along the radial distance @xmath85 are similar , with the hgt result being the largest and reaching the peak value at the lowest position .",
    "the differences in the normal stress profiles also lead to different predictions of the flow rate .",
    "the values of @xmath86 from the calculations without nsd , with nsd and using hgt are @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , which shows that larger @xmath84 results in a higher flow rate . to put this flow rate in perspective to commonly measured discharge rates",
    ", we show that the beverloo equation in the form of @xmath90  @xcite , where d is the aperture diameter and @xmath29 is of order unity , can be related to @xmath86 as @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 measured in experiments takes a value close to @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "however , according to the predictions of @xmath86 , @xmath92 is at least @xmath94 , about twice of the common value for a @xmath95 hopper .",
    "this over - prediction should mostly be ascribed to the radial analysis itself , not the constitutive model though .",
    "one major source of error is the assumption of smooth wall in this analysis . because of this gross over - prediction",
    ", we shall not assess the capability of the three different analyses regarding discharge rate prediction .",
    "as a summary of the nsd effect , with nsd the predictions of the normal stress @xmath84 and the flow rate are higher , but the stress ratio @xmath72 is lower , than without nsd .",
    "[ ]    another important functionality of the constitutive model used in this study is to directly probe the particle - friction effect on flow behavior .",
    "we have performed the same hopper - flow analysis for granular materials with particle friction @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the results for @xmath72 and @xmath84 are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : stress_2mus ] ( a)-(b ) , and ( c)-(d ) , respectively , of which ( a)-(c ) are for @xmath96 and ( b)-(d ) for @xmath97 .",
    "the fabric is modeled as independent of @xmath36 and thus not repeated in this figure . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : stress_2mus ] ( a ) and ( b ) together with fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] ( a ) , it can be seen that increasing @xmath36 results in higher @xmath72 values .",
    "the difference between predictions with and without nsd is also enlarged .",
    "similar trend is observed for the internal friction coefficient @xmath76 ( not shown ) , which is consistent with engineering observations although no quantitative comparison can be made at the moment .",
    "studying the @xmath84 in figs .",
    "[ fig : stress_2mus ] ( c)-(d ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_mu03 ] ( d ) , it can be concluded that higher @xmath36 leads to lower normal stress and does not alter the effect of nsd . from the flow - rate analysis above",
    ", it can also be deduced that higher @xmath36 results in lower flow rates .",
    "specifically , the @xmath86 values from the calculations without nsd , with nsd , and using hgt equal @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , when @xmath96 ; and @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , when @xmath97 .",
    "this effect of particle friction qualitatively matches practical experience and is supported by the dem simulations of a cylindrical silo  @xcite , but again quantitative comparison can not be made due to the lack of directly comparable data .",
    "the increase in friction also amplifies the difference between the flow rate predictions for cases with and without nsd from about @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "however , the potential of the constitutive model in facilitating understanding of the particle - property influence on the stress distribution and flow rate can clearly be seen from the above results .",
    "a radial - flow solution of the conical hopper flow has been carried out utilizing a recently - developed constitutive model  @xcite .",
    "results on stress , microstructure and flow rate have been obtained by simultaneously solving the continuity , momentum and fabric evolution equations .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a varying stress ratio is predicted , as a result of the fabric evolution .",
    "the particle friction has been shown to lead to higher stress ratios , but lower normal stress and flow rates as it increases .",
    "these results are supported qualitatively and quantitatively by dem simulations and engineering observations .",
    "the effects of considering the nsd , have been explored , showing that considering nsd results in higher normal stress and flow rate , but lower stress ratio .",
    "the difference can be as large as about @xmath106 , indicating that the nsd in constitutive models warrants more attention in order to make more accurate predictions .",
    "the significance of the constitutive model has been demonstrated to lie in connecting particle - level properties to continuum - level computation through microstructure evolution , obviating the need for specifying bulk properties and enabling prediction of particle - property effects on flow .",
    "admittedly , the radial analysis performed is too simplified to validate against other spatial measurements , or to be used as a predictive tool for hopper design .",
    "future work has been planned on applying the constitutive model to multi - dimensional analysis of compressible flow and validating against salient hopper flow behavior , such as shear localization .",
