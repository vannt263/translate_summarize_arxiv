    "as is well known , an excited two - level atom in a vacuum cavity undergoes rabi oscillation at a frequency proportional to the atom - photon coupling .",
    "this is one excellent example illustrating how the cavity modifies the optical properties of the atom , since in free space the atom would simply decay exponentially . adding a mechanical resonator to the atom - cavity system via optomechanical coupling further changes the atomic behavior , even though the mechanical resonator does not directly interact with the atom . in this paper",
    ", we study the coherent dynamics of an excited two - level atom in a vacuum optomechanical cavity .",
    "we find that as the atom - cavity rabi splitting is on resonance with the mechanical mode , the original rabi oscillation is _ sinusoidally modulated _ by the optomechanical ( light - mechanics ) interaction .",
    "this sinusoidal modulation of the rabi oscillation is non - trivial since it occurs in absence of any initial photons and phonons .",
    "an analytic model in a _ three - dimensional _ hilbert subspace of the hybrid system is developed to explain this intriguing phenomenon , and numerical simulations of the density - matrix master equation are employed to confirm the analytical analysis and to demonstrate that the result qualitatively holds even as dissipations and other non - ideal factors are taken into account .",
    "we consider the setup in fig .",
    "1 , where a two - level atom is placed in a cavity with a movable end mirror as the mechanical resonator .",
    "the single optical cavity mode is coupled to both the atom ( via dipole - moment interaction ) and the mechanical resonator ( via radiation pressure ) .",
    "the hybrid atom - optomechanical system is described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) @xcite @xmath1here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the annihilation operators for the optical field ( of frequency @xmath4 ) and the mechanical resonator ( of frequency @xmath5 ) , respectively , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) as the excited ( ground ) state of the atom , @xmath10 is the transition frequency between the atomic states , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) characterizes the strength of the light - mechanics ( light - atom ) interaction . in this letter , we use subscripts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15  to respectively denote optical ( cavity ) , atomic  and mechanical  states or parameters .",
    "the dimension of the hybrid - system hilbert space is infinite .",
    "however , as we will show later , if the system is initially in @xmath16 , i.e. , with the atom fully excited while the optical and the mechnical modes in the ground states , then during the evolution the system is confined to a _ three - dimensional _ hilbert subspace , which allows for an analytical description of the coherent dynamics .",
    "we note that the photon number plus the population in the atomic excited state is a constant of motion .",
    "thus , starting from @xmath17 the quantum state of the hybrid system at any time @xmath18 stays in the hilbert subspace @xmath19,@xmath20where @xmath21 is the one - photon fock state , @xmath22  stands for the subspace spanned by the basis vectors inside , and @xmath23 represents the hilbert space of the mechanical mode .",
    "assuming that the atom and the cavity are on resonance , i.e. , @xmath24 , we construct the eigenstates of the atom - cavity part of the hamiltonian [ @xmath25 in the two - dimensional subspace @xmath26 as@xmath27which correspond to the eigenvalues of @xmath28 . in this new basis @xmath29",
    "is diagonalized , i.e.,@xmath30with @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath32 , one has @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "thus in the subspace  @xmath19 , the total hamiltonian ( [ h0.equ ] ) becomes  @xmath35 by introducing the displaced phonon operator  @xmath36 the hamiltonian is re - written as@xmath37where a constant energy term  @xmath38 has been discarded . further assuming that  @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we neglect the term proportional to @xmath41 and make the rotating wave approximation in the above hamiltonian to obtain @xmath42 , with@xmath43this hamiltonian describes a two - level polariton  coupled to a bosonic mode , analogous to the original atom - cavity hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "in the previous section , we derived an effective hamiltonian @xmath44 in ( [ h3.equ ] ) for the hybrid system where initially the atom is fully excited and both the optical and the mechanical modes are in their ground states . at first glance ,",
    "since @xmath44 is a j - c type hamiltonian , it might suggest a simple rabi oscillation of frequency @xmath11 between _ two _ basis vectors , analogous to that in a regular atom - cavity system ( i.e. , without the mechanical resonator )",
    ". this would be true if the hybrid system were initially in @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the ground state of the displaced mechanical mode @xmath47 .",
    "however , the initial state of the system is not @xmath48 , but rather @xmath49 .",
    "as will become clear below , starting from @xmath16 , the evolution of the hybrid system involves _ three _",
    "( rather than two ) basis vectors , which in turn leads to a non - trivial modulation of the original atom - cavity rabi oscillation by the optomechanical coupling .",
    "we first take a deeper look at the initial state @xmath16 .",
    "although rigorously the ground state @xmath50 of the original mechanical mode @xmath3 is the coherent state of the displaced mode @xmath47 with the eigenvalue @xmath51 , we can well approximate @xmath50 @xmath52 @xmath53 since it has been assumed that @xmath54 . according to ( [ new1.equ ] ) ,",
    "@xmath55 is a superposition of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and thus the initial state @xmath58 is a superposition of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "further noting that @xmath61 is an eigenstate of @xmath44 , and @xmath44 couples @xmath62 only to @xmath63 and vice versa , we conclude that the coherent dynamics of the system is constrained to the three - dimensional hilbert subspace of @xmath64which allows us to obtain an analytic solution for the evolution of the hybrid system .    to this end , we diagonalize @xmath44 in the subspace @xmath65@xmath66where@xmath67and @xmath68 @xmath69 /g_{cm},\\ \\mathcal{n}=\\left ( 1+\\eta ^{2}\\right ) ^{-1/2}$ ] . with the initial state of the system decomposed [ by inverting ( [ new1.equ ] ) and ( [ new2.equ ] ) ] in terms of the three eigenvectors of @xmath44",
    "as@xmath70we get the quantum state at any time @xmath18@xmath71    to calculate the probability for the atom to stay in the excited state , we convert @xmath72 and @xmath73 in @xmath74 back to the original  basis vectors of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which can be done by simply substituting ( [ new1.equ ] ) into ( [ new2.equ ] ) . here",
    "we do not present the detailed expression of @xmath74 in the original basis , but only write down its probability amplitudes @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 : @xmath83the probability @xmath84 to find the atom in the excited state is given by @xmath85 . in terms of the more widely used poulation inversion @xmath86 , one has@xmath87where @xmath88and @xmath89 is the probability for the atom to be in the ground state .",
    "( [ dp.equ ] ) is drastically different from the standard rabi oscillation @xmath90 in the atom - cavity system governed by hamiltonian @xmath29 [ ( [ hca.equ ] ) ] .",
    "particularly , if the atom - cavity rabi splitting is on resonance with the mechanical mode , i.e. , @xmath91 , we can simplify ( [ dp.equ ] ) into@xmath92which shows that _ the optomechanical coupling modulates the original atom - cavity rabi oscilation with a cosine envelope function_. this sinusoidally modulated rabi oscillation is our central result , and its derivation has involved a fairly large amount of mathematics , so in next paragraph we will provide a more physically intuitive argument .    to do this",
    ", we analyze the action of @xmath44 in ( [ h3.equ ] ) on the three dimensional hilbert subspace @xmath65 in ( [ hil3.equ ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath44 induces two distinct oscillatory transitions : on a short time scale of @xmath93 , the atom - cavity interaction ( @xmath94 ) yields the rabi oscillation between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , or equivalently , the oscillation of the dynamical phase difference between the @xmath97 and @xmath61 components ; on a long time scale of @xmath98 , the optomechanical coupling [ @xmath99 causes the polariton - phonon  oscillation between @xmath45 and @xmath100 . at @xmath101 ,",
    "the system is in @xmath102 , and the atom - cavity interaction generates the rabi oscillation on the short time scale . after a duration of @xmath103 , @xmath62 evolves into @xmath104 due to the optomechanical coupling , and the state of the system becomes @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a phase difference between the two fock states of the ( displaced ) mechanical mode . around this time ( @xmath107 )",
    "there is no atom - cavity rabi oscillation since the @xmath48 component dose not exist in the system state .",
    "after another duration of @xmath103 , i.e. , at @xmath108 , @xmath109 evolves back to @xmath59 , and the atom - cavity rabi oscillation re - appears . for other @xmath18 @xmath110 , partial rabi oscillations ( i.e. , without completely reaching the ground or the excited states of the atom ) occur .",
    "this pattern repeats in every period of @xmath111 , leading to the periodically - modulated rabi oscillation in ( dp1.equ ) .",
    "we notice that the envelope function in ( [ dp1.equ ] ) has a period of @xmath112 , but the rabi oscillation on the short time scale does not distinguish positive and negative values of the envelope function , and thus the modulation period  is indeed @xmath113 , agreeing with our analysis above .",
    "we further remark that the involvement of three ( rather than two ) basis vectors in @xmath65 is crucial to the sinusoidally modulated rabi oscillation , because it is the optomechanical transition between @xmath114 and @xmath104 that gives rise to the modulation of the regular atom - cavity rabi oscillation in the subspace of @xmath115 .",
    "( [ dp1.equ ] ) , which illustrates the sinusoidal modulation of the rabi oscillation in the atom - optomechanical system , has been derived with the following assumptions : no dissipations , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and deviations from these ideal conditions are expected to affect the dynamics .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is slightly detuned from @xmath119 ( and thus @xmath120 ) , then @xmath121 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ dp.equ ] ) [ rather than eq .",
    "( [ dp1.equ ] ) ] , where the second term on the right - hand side perturbs the ideal  dynamics manifested in the first term .",
    "to more comprehensively understand the robustness of the modulated rabi oscillation , we resort to numerical simulations of the density - matrix ( @xmath122 ) master equation @xcite for the hybrid",

    "it has also been assumed that both the optical and the atomic heat baths have zero thermal occupation at @xmath4 and @xmath10 , which is a good approximation at room temperature for @xmath4 and @xmath10 within the visible - light frequency range .",

    "( [ dp1.equ ] ) is no longer valid since @xmath137 , but eq .",
    "( [ dp.equ ] ) still holds . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ dp.equ ] ) agrees well with the numerical result , and the modulation of the rabi oscillation is not ideally sinusoidal .",

    "2b , as well as figs . 3a and 3b , immediately confirms this conclusion , and thus provides further support for our analytic model in the previous section .",
    "next we investigate the situation where dissipations are present by adopting @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "we also allow that the other parameters do not rigorously meet ( but not deviate too much from ) the requirements for eq .",
    "( [ dp1.equ ] ) , with @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , since the mechanical mode can at best be _ pre - cooled _ to a small but finite mean occupation number @xmath145 , we set the mechanical resonator to be initially in a thermal state ( rather than the ground state ) of @xmath146 .",
    "the numerical solution for @xmath121 , as plotted in fig .",

    "in summary , the quantum behavior of an excited two - level atom in a vacuum optomechanical cavity can be qualitatively modified by the mechanical resonator .",
    "particularly , if the atom - cavity rabi splitting is on resonance with the mechanical mode , then the standard rabi oscillation of the atom is sinusoidally modulated .",
    "the modulation originates from the `` polariton - phonon '' transition caused by the coupling between the optical field and the mechanical resonator .",
