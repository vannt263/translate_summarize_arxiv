    "radio galaxies are excellent laboratories to disentangle the role of central active nuclei in host galaxies evolution and the relation of intergalactic environment and the central activity .",
    "the complex structure of radio galaxies put severe troubles to carry out specific optical studies in this matter .",
    "fortunately , the recent technical and computational improvements on integral field spectroscopy ( ifs hereafter ) open new frontiers to multitude of astronomical projects . in the particular case of radio galaxies ,",
    "ifs data allow to separate the different components and to perform an independent analysis of the various subsystems and their evolution .",
    "3c  120 is a seyfert 1 galaxy at a redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "it has been studied extensively at many wide - range wavelengths , with special attention in x - ray and radio frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although 3c  120 was classified as an early - type galaxy based on a visual inspection of ground - based images @xcite , @xcite reported a faint spiral structure .",
    "however , its optical morphology is still not clear showing an elliptical shape with some peculiarities @xcite and could be a merger remnant galaxy @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic analysis has shown that 3c  120 presents a rotation curve most likely indicating the presence of an undetected disk @xcite .",
    "based on this result , 3c  120 is normally quoted as an early - type spiral or s0 galaxy @xcite .",
    "although seyfert galaxies are generally considered as radio - quiet objects , 3c  120 is an active radio - loud source showing a superluminal one - sided jet that extends @xmath425@xmath5 out of the core @xcite .",
    "different authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    " 3 , we describe the emission line profiles in the circumnuclear region of 3c  120 and we present 2d spectra diagrams for different emission lines ( appendix a ) . in the following sections , we present the stellar morphology and the structures detected ( section  4.1 ) , the average colors of the galaxy and the colors of those structures ( section  4.2 ) , and the emission - line morphology and ionization structure ( section  4.3 ) . in section  5 , we apply a new technique to separate the spectra of different components coexisting in 3c  120 and analyze the properties of each component .",
    "we present the velocity field of the central region of 3c  120 and the discussion of several kinematic perturbations in section  6 . a distance of 198 mpc",

    "ifs optical observations with fibers are based on the idea of connecting the focal plane of the telescope with the spectrograph slit using a fiber bundle . in this way , when an extended object is observed , each fiber receives light coming from a particular region of the object .",
    "each individual spectrum appears well separated on the detector and therefore , spatial and spectral information are collected simultaneously .",

    "ifs of 3c  120 was obtained the 26th of february 2003 at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) on the island of la palma , spain .",
    "the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) was used in combination with the fiber system integral @xcite and the wyffos spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out under photometric conditions and an average seeing of 1@xmath102 .",
    "the standard bundle 2 of integral was used during these observations .",
    "this bundle consists of 219 fibers , each one with a diameter of 0@xmath109 projected on the sky .",
    "a central rectangle is formed by 189 fibers covering a field - of - view of @xmath11 , and the remaining 30 fibers form a ring with a diameter of @xmath12 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the actual distribution of the science fibers on the focal plane .",
    "the wyffos spectrograph was equipped with a 300 groove mm@xmath8 grating centred on 5500   ( spectral coverage : 3500 - 9000  ) .",
    "a tek6 ccd array of @xmath13 pixels of 24 @xmath14 m size was used , giving a linear dispersion of about 3   pixels@xmath8 . with this configuration , and pointing to the central region of 3c  120 , three exposures of 1800 seconds each were taken .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf standard routines @xcite .",
    "although the reduction of ifs data from fiber - based instruments does not differ significantly from standard spectroscopic data reduction , we describe briefly in this section the reduction procedure .",
    "a master bias frame was built by averaging different bias frames taken along the night .",
    "this bias frame was then subtracted from the science frames . in observations with optical fibers , flats -",
    "fields are obtained illuminating the focal plane uniformly , and obtaining spectra ( the so - called flat - spectra ) .",
    "thus , for a particular wavelength , the differences in response among fibers dominate the flat - spectra shape .",
    "these differences are due to their distinct focal - ratio degradation , position at the entrance of the spectrograph , etc . in this way , flat - spectra",
    "are used to homogenize the response of all the fibers .",
    "flat - spectra are also used to obtain the polynomial fits to define the fiber path along the detector and extract the individual spectra from the whole image .",
    "each spectrum appears well separated on the detector , with a width of approximately two pixels in the spatial direction ( according to the core fiber image size of the fiber bundle used for these observations ) .",
    "the trace and extraction of individual spectra was performed using the standard routine apall of iraf .",
    "after this operation , frames of @xmath13 pixels were reduced to @xmath15 pixel : each pixel in the spatial direction contains the spectrum of each particular fiber , a total of 219 fibers .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done using the identify and reidentify routines of iraf . in order to carry out this procedure",
    ", we selected several isolated and well - distributed arc lines . although it might be difficult to determine the actual uncertainty produced by the wavelength calibration , we have used the sky lines in our spectra to estimate the final wavelength errors , being smaller that 35.5 kms@xmath8 and 29.5 kms@xmath8 at blue and red wavelengths , respectively .",
    "the sp1045 + 378 flux standard star ( isaac newton group database ) was observed the same night and under similar conditions as for 3c  120 .",
    "the standard star has been used to calibrate a flux ratio by comparing with the standard - star flux tables of stone ( 1977 ) .",
    "we reduced the sp1045 + 378 frames in a similar way than the object ones , correcting them for differential atmospheric refraction @xcite using e3d @xcite .",
    "then , we extracted the observed spectrum of the star by co - adding the spectra of the central 37 fibers , which includes @xmath1699% of the total flux . comparing this observed spectrum with the flux - calibrated spectrum of sp1045 + 378 we derived a sensitivity curve that we used to calibrate the object frames .",
    "we combine the ida tool @xcite and the euro3d visualization package @xcite to analyze the data and generate two - dimensional maps of any spectral feature ( intensity , velocity , width , etc ) .",
    "maps recovered from spectra are images of 51@xmath1737 pixels with a scale 0@xmath103/pixel . while the spatial sampling of the used integral configuration is 0@xmath109 ( that is , the fiber diameter of the bundle 2 ) , the centroid of any peak in our maps can be measured with an accuracy of around 1/5 of the fiber diameter , that is @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "wide - field planetary ( wfpc ) camera images of 3c  120 in different bands are available on the archive of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "we obtained these images to study the morphology of this object .",
    "table [ tab_hst ] summarizes the properties of these images .",
    "the data set comprises three broadband images ( f555w , f675w and f814w ) , which roughly corresponds to the standard @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21-bands , and a medium band image ( f547 m ) .",
    "these images basically sample the continuum emission in 3c  120 , since the equivalent width of mostly all the emission lines is very small compared with the width of the bands .",
    "however , there is a non neglectible contamination , dominated by the [ oiii ] and h@xmath22 emission lines in the f555w - band image ( and h@xmath23 in the f657w - band image ) .",
    "the f547m - band image can be used as an estimation of the pure continuum emission , since the emission lines are at the edge of its transmission curve .",
    "the data set is deep enough to study the different structures present in this object @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the nuclear spectrum of 3c  120 in the full wavelength range . this spectrum has been obtained by co adding the seven spectra closest to the continuum peak",
    "this is almost equivalent to a hexagonal aperture of 1@xmath106 in radius centred at the optical nucleus of 3c  120 .",
    "we can easily recognize several emission lines and the characteristic broad component of permitted emission lines of seyfert 1 galaxies .    in the appendix",
    "a , we present the individual spectra corresponding to each of the different observed positions ( fibers ) in selected spectral intervals that include the most important emission lines ( spectra diagrams ) .      the profiles of the emission lines in the nuclear spectrum of 3c  120 show a considerable blending due to the wings of the broad component of permitted lines ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the h@xmath24 profile appears to be considerably broader than any other balmer line , but this is not the case of h@xmath24 as in previously found by other studies @xcite .",
    "the hei@xmath25 shows also a considerable broadening . at this step",
    ", we can not discuss the origin of these features in terms of recombination models and reddening effects because the nuclear spectrum in figure 2 includes the contribution of the nucleus and the surrounding galaxy . in section  5 we separate both contributions and we will be in position to tackle this discussion .",
    "the low spectral resolution of the current ifs data prevents the detection of double peaks reported by @xcite .",
    "however , the emission lines show asymmetric profiles in some locations outside the central region .",
    "in this appendix we present the spatial distribution of the brightest emission line profiles as spectra diagrams .",
    "these diagrams represent line profiles in a short wavelength range of the individual spectra at each point ( fiber ) .",
    "the spectra at each location are autoscaled to show the profile shape ( lines nearer to the optical nucleus are brighter than those farther out ) .",
    "figure 13 and 14 show the spectra diagrams corresponding to h@xmath22+[oiii]@xmath73 , and h@xmath23+[nii]@xmath74+[sii]@xmath75 , respectively .",
    "a considerable blending of the emission lines with the wings of the broad component of the balmer lines can be clearly appreciated in these diagrams .",
    "broad - band images of 3c  120 were recovered from our ifs data by coadding the flux in spectral ranges that mimic the band - passes of the previously refereed hst images and using an interpolation routine @xcite .",
    "the specific wavelength ranges for each band were 3900 - 4900 (@xmath26-band ) , 5000 - 6000 (@xmath19-band ) , 5600 - 5700 (@xmath27-band ) , 6100 - 7100 (@xmath20-band ) and 7550 - 8550 (@xmath21-band ) .",
    "all images show a bright nucleus on top of a weak host galaxy .",
    "figure 3a presents the intensity map corresponding to the @xmath19-band filter .",
    "the intensity contours have an elliptical shape except for those at around 4 arcsec from the central peak , showing an elongation toward the west .",
    "there are remarkable similarities between the restored map ( fig .",
    "3a ) and the f555w - band image from the hst ( fig .",
    "3b ) , despite of the differences in wavelength ranges and spatial sampling .",
    "the superior resolution of the hst images allows to directly detecting several structures .",
    "these structures have been previously reported subtracting a galaxy template to broad and narrow band ground base images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have labeled , using the nomenclature introduced by @xcite , the different detected structures ( figure 3b ) .",
    "the hst / f555w - band image allows to resolve them , showing a richer level of structures .",
    "in particular , structures b , and c are composed of a smoothed low surface brightness component and more luminous clumpy substructures .",
    "structure a seems to be more collimated , as previously noticed by ground based imaging , which explains why it was initially confused with the optical counterpart of the radio jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it shows also a low surface brightness component and four clear clumps .",
    "we overplot in figure 3b the radio - map at 4885 mhz ( walker 1997 ) , showing that the structure a is most likely related to the structure b rather than to the radio - jet . indeed",
    ", the hst images suggest that both structures belong to a sequence of clumpy knots which are physically connected .",
    "dust lines and shell structures not detected from the ground are seen in the inner regions .",
    "two shell arcs at @xmath28 north and south of the central peak are clearly detected in the hst images .",
    "although previous hst images show extensions to the north - west and south - east in the inner region of 3c  120 @xcite , to our knowledge this is the first time that the shell structure is clearly visible .",
    "the north and south shells are named s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 , respectively , hereafter .",
    "the s@xmath30 seems to be connected to structure a by a faint tail .",
    "a 2d modeling of the broad - band images was performed using galfit @xcite to obtain a clear picture of the morphology of 3c  120 .",
    "this program has been extensively tested in the image decomposition of qso / hosts @xcite .",
    "the 2d model comprises a narrow gaussian function ( to model the nucleus ) and a galaxy template ( to model the galaxy ) both convolved with a psf .",
    "we performed the fit twice , first using a sersic law @xcite to characterize the galaxy and then using a de  vaucouleurs law @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to determine the morphological type of the host galaxy , based on the obtained sersic index , and to get a good determination of the galaxy flux , based on the modeling the de  vaucouleurs law @xcite .",
    "the psf was created using a field star for the analysis of the hst images , and a calibration star for the analysis of the broad - band images recovered from the ifs data .",
    "we applied first the fitting technique to the hst images because of their better spatial resolution .",
    "the nucleus was saturated in the hst / f814w - band , which prevents us to do a two - model fitting , and limits the reliability of any morphological classification , which strongly depends on the shape of the profile in the inner regions . to derive a rough estimation of the host magnitude we masked the nucleus , and fixed the scale to the average of the values derived in the other available hst / bands .",
    "further checks , explained below , demonstrated that this approach was valid .",
    "table [ tab_galfit ] summarizes the results from this analysis . for each band",
    "it shows the derived sersic index , the nucleus and host magnitudes and the effective radius of the host galaxy .",
    "the derived sersic indices , all near or larger than the nominal value of 4 for an early - type galaxy , confirm the morphological classification of the host galaxy of 3c  120 as a bulge dominated galaxy .",
    "we subtracted the object template ( galaxy+nucleus ) derived by the 2d modeling from the original images , obtaining a residual image for each band .",
    "these residual images were used to study the properties of the different structures , once decontaminated from the smooth component . as an example , the residual image of the @xmath19-band and the hst / f555w - band are shown in figure 3c and 3d , respectively .",
    "the already quoted structures are now clearly identified .",
    "the s@xmath30 shell coincides with an extended emission line region ( eelr ) previously detected in this object @xcite and labeled as e@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as already quoted all the broad - band images recovered from the ifs data show a similar morphology than the @xmath19-band image shown in figure 3a .",
    "combining these recovered broad - band maps , we obtained color maps of 3c  120 .",
    "figure 4a shows the @xmath31 color map derived from the ifs data .",
    "it shows a blue circumnuclear region elongated to the southwest .",
    "the elongation towards the west seen in the broad band images has also a counterpart in the color maps showing bluer colors at a region @xmath32 west of the nucleus than its surroundings .",
    "figure 4b presents the @xmath31 color map derived from the f555w and f814w - band hst images . despite of their different spatial resolution , figures 4a and 4b present remarkable similarities",
    "the different structures quoted in section  4.1 show bluer @xmath31 colors than the average color of the host galaxy , as already noticed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure 4b also shows evidence for two weaker shells farther from the central peak than s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 but also at the north and south .",
    "however , these `` secondary '' shells are fainter , being at the detection limit .    both the @xmath19-band and the f555w - band images are contaminated by the emission from [ oiii ] and h@xmath22 . a rough estimation of how strong that contamination is can be obtained by subtracting a scaled continuum image , clean of those contaminations .",
    "figure 4c shows the residual image of the integral @xmath19-band image after the subtraction of an adequate continuum ( the @xmath27-band image ) .",
    "a similar estimation was done for the hst images , subtracting the continuum dominated f547m - band image from the f555w - band image ( figure 4d ) .",
    "this image was smoothed using an 11@xmath1711 pixels median kernel to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the resulting maps are a rough estimation of the distribution of the [ oiii]+h@xmath22 emission .",
    "the position of two of the eelrs detected in this object ( e@xmath0 and e@xmath1 , hereafter ) is indicated @xcite .",
    "the residual images of the continuum , after subtracting a model template ( fig . 3c and 3d ) , are overplotted for comparison purposes .",
    "the s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 shells show a strong gaseous emission in the hst images , which in the s@xmath30 extends towards the e@xmath1 region .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath33 colors of the host galaxy and the different structures as a function of the @xmath34 colors .",
    "as already noticed in the color image , the structures have bluer @xmath33 colors than the host galaxy .",
    "this indicates most probably the presence of somewhat younger stellar populations associated with them .",
    "however , they show a wider range of @xmath34 colors than that of @xmath33 colors . indeed , the average @xmath34 color of the host galaxy is within the range of @xmath34 colors of the different structures .",
    "the color - to - color distribution derived from synthetic models has been included in the figure for comparisons .",
    "the discontinuous line shows the colors of single stellar populations calculated using the @xcite models .",
    "we assumed a solar metalicity and a @xcite imf .",
    "the labels indicate the logarithm of the stellar population ages in gyrs .",
    "in general terms , the color - to - color distribution does not match with that simple model , apart from the case of the s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 shells .",
    "for the remaining structures , the @xmath34 colors correspond on average to a young stellar population of @xmath46@xmath1710@xmath35 gyr , but the @xmath33 colors correspond to older stellar populations .",
    "this may indicate that the real populations are a composite of populations .",
    "the dotted line shows the colors of different galaxy types ( e , sab , sbc , scd and irr ) @xcite , which mainly correspond to different mixes of stellar populations .",
    "the @xmath34 color of the host galaxy mainly corresponds to a sab - scd galaxy . on average ,",
    "the structures have @xmath33 colors that correspond to the same kind of galaxies ( sab - scd ) , but their @xmath34 colors expand over all the range of possible colors .",
    "so far we have ignored the effects of dust in the color - to - color distribution shown in figure 5 .",
    "however , the dust content in 3c  120 is rather high ; an average value of a@xmath36 mags has been estimated @xcite .",
    "dust extinction redden both @xmath33 and @xmath34 colors in an almost similar way @xcite .",
    "the effects of dust in the color - to - color distribution is illustrated with an arrow in fig .",
    "it is clear that the dust is not homogeneously distributed in the galaxy : e.g. , typical dust lanes are seen in figure 3b .",
    "a combined effect of different stellar populations and a non - homogeneous distribution of dust could explain the observed color - to - color distribution .",
    "in that case , the s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 structures would be dust - free areas dominated by a single stellar population .",
    "however , results from broadband colors should be taken with care .",
    "the contamination of broadband filters by strong emission lines can drastically affect the morphology of color maps . in the case of 3c  120",
    "the problem is even worse because of the contribution and contamination from the broad component of the balmer emission lines in the central regions .",
    "we performed a line profile fitting and de - blending in order to study the integrated high and low ionization gas distribution , their physical properties and kinematics .",
    "we fit a single gaussian to any of the bright emission lines in the spectra . for the balmer lines",
    ", we included a second broader gaussian to fit the wide line from the broad line region ( blr ) . in spite of our poor spectral resolution",
    ", we found that several spectra have evidence of substructures , showing asymmetric profiles with blue or red wings indicating the presence of several gaseous systems in 3c  120 . indeed , previous authors ( axon et al .",
    "1989 ) reported the existence of several components in the emission lines of 3c  120 , but to apply a line - profile decomposition to separate the different gaseous components would be unrealistic because of the low spectral resolution of the current ifs data .",
    "the broad component of the balmer lines is confined to the nucleus discarding an extended broad emission line region .",
    "figure 6 shows the intensity maps of [ oiii]@xmath37 ( figure 6a ) and h@xmath23 ( figure 6b ) after the deblending .",
    "intensity contours of ionized gas are clearly elongated toward the e@xmath1 structure .",
    "emission line maps present an elongation to the west , forming a clear secondary peak at around 5 arscec from the nucleus in the [ oiii ] intensity map .",
    "this secondary peak corresponds to the e@xmath0 structure previously quoted ( section  4.2 ) .",
    "the ratio of the h@xmath23 intensity of the nucleus and e@xmath0 is much smaller than that of [ oiii]@xmath37 , suggesting a high ionization nature of the latter .",
    "the nuclear region shows a low ionization degree in the [ oiii]@xmath37/h@xmath22 map surrounded by a ring of high ionization ( figure 6c ) , with larger values at the south of the nucleus , coincident with the location of e@xmath1 .",
    "a high ionisation region expands from the ring to the west , increasing the ionisation degree along this direction .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath38/h@xmath23 line ratio map ( figure 6d ) also shows a ring structure , surrounding the nuclear region .",
    "the e@xmath0 is on the path of the 3c  120 radio - jet , as well as the continuum dominated structure _",
    "the high [ oiii]/h@xmath22 ratio of e@xmath0 ( figure 6c ) discards a relation between _ a _ and e@xmath0 , assuming that _ a _ is a star forming region in a spiral arm or a tidal tail , and points , more likely , to a direct connection between e@xmath0 and the radio - jet @xcite . while the nucleus and the _ a _ region present [ oiii]@xmath37/h@xmath22 and [ nii]@xmath38/h@xmath23 ratios at the limit of hii regions in a diagnostic diagram @xcite , those ratios of e@xmath0 and its west surroundings are placed on the high - ionization region .",
    "the distribution of the h@xmath23/h@xmath22 line ratio ( figure 6e ) shows a dust lane crossing 3c  120 along the southeast - northwest direction .",
    "the high balmer decrement at the west points to a high dust obscuration around e@xmath0 .",
    "however , we can not rule out that the high h@xmath23/h@xmath22 ratio may be related to the low signal to noise of the narrow component of h@xmath22 in the circumnuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "the electronic density derived from the [ sii]@xmath39/@xmath40 presents a patchy structure , showing an enlargement in the location of e@xmath0 . in the next section ,",
    "the ionization conditions of the different structures in the observed region of 3c  120 are studied in detail .",
    "in the previous section , we used the traditional method ( gaussian fitting ) to deblend the different gaseous components . ifs optical observations record spatial and spectral information simultaneously . taking advantage of this fact",
    ", we have developed a technique ( 3d - modeling hereafter ) to disentangle the spectra of the main components of 3c  120 ( nucleus+host ) , and to obtain cleaned spectra of the different structures described above .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied recently @xcite .",
    "a brief summary of the technique is described in the appendix b , and will be explained in detail in a separate article ( snchez et al . , in prep . ) . in summary ,",
    "the technique provides us with a spectrum of each of the main components of the object plus a residual data cube that can be used to derive cleaned spectra of the different structures in the object and/or analyze their morphological and kinematical properties .",
    "this is an extension of the 2d modeling of images applied in section ",
    "4.1 to each of the monochromatic images of the data cube derived from ifs optical observations .",
    "we applied the 3d modeling to the current data and we derived the 3c  120 nucleus spectrum , the mean host galaxy spectrum and a residual data - cube of spectra .      to compare the results from the proposed technique to those of the traditional method ,",
    "figure 7a shows the greyscale of the residual from the 2d modeling of the f555w / hst - band image obtained in section  4.1 ( figure 3d ) .",
    "we over plotted the contours of a narrow - band image centred on the continuum adjacent to the [ oiii ] emission line ( 5204 - 5246  ) extracted from the residual data cube of spectra obtained after the 3d modeling . the main continuum dominated structures ( a , b and c ) are detected @xmath41@xmath5 from the nucleus . as expected , the shell structure detected at @xmath41@xmath5 north and south of the nucleus in the hst images is not detected with the ifs data .",
    "a combination of the superior resolution of the hst images , the effects of the seeing and the sampling of our ifs data can explain it . in figure",

    "the major difference is found in the position of the nucleus in the diagram , which seems to lie in the location of star forming regions .",

    "that is , direct photo ionization from the uv - field of the agn . in that case",

    "this result agrees with the results based on the broadband colors of the structures , discussed in  4.2 .",
    "therefore , the continuum structures are experiencing a decrease of the dust content , rather than an increase of the star formation .",
    "this seems to be particularly valid for the a structure , which lies in a minimum of the dust content , derived from the h@xmath23/h@xmath22  line ratio ( see fig .",
    "unfortunately , we can not check it for the b and c structures , because the gaseous emission in those regions is less luminous and therefore the h@xmath23/h@xmath22   ratio is uncertain .",

    "however , as it was shown in  4.1 ( and noticed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath52 does not follow the radio - jet into the core , being more likely associated with @xmath26 and @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , the measured polarization may be due to unsubtracted scattered - light from the nucleus @xcite , that we detected in the average spectrum of the host ( fig . 8 and  5.2 ) .",
    "indeed , the seds of the three different condensations do not differ significantly ( fig .",
    "9b ) , and , in particular , they show almost the same @xmath33 colors ( fig .",

    "the central wavelengths of the gaussians fitted to the individual spectra ( section  4.3 ) give us the radial velocity associated to the ionized gas at each position . interpolating the individual emission line centroids , we obtain the velocity field of different emission lines .",

    "our results are in agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite pointing towards highly distorted kinematics in this object .",
    "the unclear morphology and highly distorted gas kinematics of 3c  120 makes a simple interpretation of the velocity structure difficult .",
    "the ionized gas velocity field presents a general regular pattern , with larger velocities at the north - west and lower at the south - east that may be consistent with a disk rotating around an axis along the north - east direction ( figure 11a and 11b ) .",
    "several kinematical perturbations can be identify in the velocity maps as well as a regular rotation .",
    "a velocity gradient is located at @xmath45@xmath5 west of the nucleus , aligned with the radio - jet ( figure 3b ) , at the position of e@xmath0 ( figure 11a ) . using a better spectral resolution , @xcite",
    "show that there are two different kinematics components rather than a velocity gradient .",
    "the north component is receding while the south component is approaching .",
    "the kinematical perturbation is most probably due to the lateral expansion of the radio - jet @xcite : as already quoted , the interaction of the radio - jet and the intergalactic gas produces an enhancement of the gas density ( section  4.3 ) , and perturbs the kinematics @xcite .",
    "the velocity field derived from [ oiii ] is much more distorted to the east ( farther than 4 arcsec from the nucleus ) than that one derived from h@xmath23 .",
    "although the signal to noise in the ifs spectra is low and uncertainties are larger in that region , differences in the kinematics may be explained by the different origin of these lines .",
    "the comparison of the continuum dominated structures and the velocity field derived from the h@xmath23 shows that @xmath52 and @xmath26 coincide with a velocity distortion located at the west of the nucleus ( figure 11b ) .",
    "this kinematical feature is similar to those found in the velocity field of spiral galaxies because of the arms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this gives support to the idea of identifing the @xmath52 and @xmath26 regions as structures in an spiral arm in 3c  120 in spite of its poor gas content and continuum emission dominated by starlight .",

    "we will refer to this map as the velocity map of residuals hereafter .",
    "the kinematics of the structures trace remarkable well the perturbations in the velocity field , although their kinematical features are smoother in the latter .",
    "the smoothing is a clear consequence of the blending of the host galaxy and the structure spectra .",
    "the velocity map of the residuals represents much better the kinematics of the gas clouds in e@xmath0 , e@xmath1 , and e@xmath2 .",
    "we found a clear gradient of velocities in the region corresponding to the three structures pointing to inflows / outflows of gas at different inclination angles and outside of the galactic disk . while regions e@xmath0 and e@xmath1 present a north - south velocity gradient , e@xmath2 shows an east west gradient in good agreement with the [ oiii ] velocity map ( figure 11a ) .    despite of the bulge dominated morphology found in the inner regions of 3c  120 , the velocity field derived from h@xmath23 indicates the presence of a rotating disk along the north - west / south - east ( figure 11b ) . in that case , the receding velocities at the northwest suggest that southeast is the face closer to the observer .",
    "the velocity gradient also traces the line of zero velocities , but it is not clearly defined in the derived velocity field because of the distortions in the center introduced by the sy1 nucleus . with a larger spatial coverage , @xcite determined a pa=72@xmath59 for the minor kinematics axis .",
    "this angle agrees with the semi - minor axis determined from the 2d modeling of the galaxy ( section  4.1 ) .",
    "a visual inspection of the velocity fields in figures 11a and 11b indicates that this pa may be a good estimation of the minor kinematics axis , when considering the distortion at the west .",
    "however , this distortion is most likely produced by the interaction of the radio - jet with the e@xmath0 cloud @xcite , and most probably is not related with the rotating disk .",
    "the isovelocity contours of the velocity field derived from h@xmath23 and the position of the kinematical center ( @xmath60 north - west of the nucleus ) suggest that the minor kinematical axis is most likely along pa@xmath61 , which is not far from the photometric determinations and within their uncertainties . therefore , we will consider hereafter a pa=@xmath62 for the major kinematics axis of 3c  120 .",
    "figure 12 shows the rotation curve of 3c  120 derived from the velocity field of h@xmath23 , assuming a pa of @xmath62 for the major kinematics axis .",
    "this curve is clearly distorted at the south - east due to the kinematical perturbations associated with e@xmath1 .",
    "however , the north - west portion of the curve is remarkable similar to those of galactic rotating disks @xcite .",
    "the effects of the perturbations in the south - east portion of the curve must be removed prior to model the 2d distribution of the rotating component of the galaxy .",
    "for doing so , it was assumed that the approaching portion of the rotation curve ( south - east ) follows a symmetrical counterpart of the receding portion ( north - west ) .",
    "hypothetical _ rotation curve was included in figure 12 .",
    "this curve was then used to derive a template of the velocity field by applying a simple rotational model @xcite , for different inclinations varying from @xmath45@xmath63 to @xmath485@xmath63 . subtracting those templates from the h@xmath23 velocity field and minimizing the differences at the northwest region ( where the rotation curve really corresponds to the 3c  120 kinematical behavior ) , we estimated an inclination angle of @xmath64 for the disk component of 3c  120 .",
    "the velocity field template corresponding to that inclination angle is shown in figure 11e .",
    "this estimation of the inclination is in agreement with the determination from the external isophote @xcite . as quoted before ,",

    "indeed , the ellipticities derived from the 2d modeling ( section  4.1 ) indicate that the inclination may range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 in the center , in agreement with the kinematical estimation .",
    "the differences in inclination from the center to the outer regions , although small , suggest a slightly warped disk component in 3c  120 .",

    "11d ) present a rather good qualitative agreement in spite of the strong conceptual and practical differences of the two methods used to derived them .",
    "this supports the idea of the presence of a rotational component in 3c  120 .    due to the low spectral resolution of our data",
    "no attempt was done to analyze the velocity dispersion maps .",
    "in previous sections we presented several aspects of 3c  120 that describe a puzzle environment .",
    "3c 120 is morphologically speaking a bulge dominated galaxy , which contains a rotating stellar disk and several continuum- dominated structures and eelrs .",
    "we analyzed in detail those structures in order to determine their nature .",
    "the @xmath70 is caused by the interaction of the radio - jet with the intergalactic medium , as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "the newly reported shells in the central region of 3c 120 is an addition to the complex picture of this object .",
    "shells are common structures in elliptical and so galaxies , although a few number of spirals also show the presence of this kind of features @xcite .",
    "although models considering internal shock waves were proposed to account for the presence of shells in galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the most accepted idea is that they are generated by merging processes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the number and sharpness of shells in merger remnants depend on the mass ratio and the absence ( or presence ) of a central buldge in the progenitors @xcite .",
    "the radial distribution of shells depends on the potential of the host galaxy and their morphology can appear aligned or randomly distributed around the galaxy @xcite .",
    "3c 120 shows two well defined shells , labelled as s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 , and some other shell - like faint features which are aligned along an axis of pa@xmath71 . when shells are well aligned along a certain axis , this axis is always close to the major axis of the galaxy @xcite , which is out case .",
    "shells can be found in a wide range of radii from the nucleus , from only a few to hundreds of kpc , such us in the case of ngc 3923 @xcite .",
    "the innest shell detected in 3c 120 is at around 1 arcsec north ( @xmath9 kpc ) of the nucleus .",
    "shells found close to the nucleus implies that a dissipative process has played an important role in the formation of the shells @xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of the detected circumnuclear shells ( section  4.1 ) strongly suggests the idea of considering 3c 120 as a late stage merger .    the arm - like clumpy structures a and b ( section  4.1 ) show kinematics that resembles those of a spiral arm as explained in section  6",
    ". however , spiral arms are active star forming regions , and no star formation was detected in either of the continuum - dominated structures . in that case",
    ", these structures could be also the remnant of a merging process .",
    "indeed , the regions b , a and the s@xmath72 seem to be connected in our residual and color maps ( fig 3c and 4b ) , and s@xmath72 is associated with the e@xmath1 eelr . a kinematics feature ( fig .",

    "numerical simulations indicate that these kind of structures are found as remnants of merging processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) being difficult to be explained by any other mechanism . assuming that scenario ,",
    "the presence of an over density of gas in the south shell may indicate an inflow , where the warmer gas has dropped faster into the inner regions .",
    "this picture is in good agreement with the kinematics features at the south shell ( e@xmath1 clouds kinematics ) and its residuals .",
    "the regular velocity in this region suggests that this inflow may occur in a plane outside the galactic disk and close to the line of sight .",
    "although the kinematics of the merger remnants strongly depends on the viewpoint , the velocity and velocity dispersion measured for e@xmath1 is in good agreement with merger simulations @xcite .",
    "theoretical models indicate that inflows channeling gas from the outer to the nuclear regions may appear in the late stages of a merging process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the discussion above suggests that the structures a , b , and the e@xmath1 eelr can be identified with a tidal tail driving material to the central region most probably due to a past merger event in 3c 120 .",
    "most of the analyzed continuum dominated structures shows a rather young stellar population , indicating a recent ( but not ongoing ) star formation rate .",
    "this result agrees with the picture of a post - merging event .",
    "similar results have been found in the study of the optical colors of host galaxies agns @xcite .",
    "the poor spatial coverage of the third identified eelr , e@xmath2 , prevents us of drawing a clear picture of its origin .",
    "in fact , this region corresponds ( see section  5.1 ) to a tail extension of a larger structure already reported in this object @xcite .",
    "although we can not be conclusive with our current data , the kinematical results most probably indicate that e@xmath2 is associated with an inflow / outflow of gas to / from the circumnuclear region .",
    "it has long been suggested that strong interactions and galaxy mergings may ( re-)ignite nuclear activity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "galaxy interactions can produce the loss of momentum required to allow the infall of gas towards the nuclear regions , gas that would feed the agn .",
    "many authors found that agn hosts show distorted morphologies , reminiscent of past merging events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are found in environments with high probability of experiencing interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "their hosts , mostly early - type galaxies , present anomalous blue colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all together it may indicate that , if not all , at least a family of agns is generated by the merging / interaction between galaxies @xcite . a merging event alone",
    "i d not enough to generate an agn .",
    "the presence of a massive black - hole in the progenitor galaxy is a basic requerement .",
    "massive black - holes are only found in bulge - dominated massive galaxies , due to the black - hole / bulge mass relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , recent results ( snchez et al . , in prep . ) show that the fraction of agns increases in galaxy mergers between two large galaxies or a large with an small galaxy .",
    "our current results agree with this sceneario .",
    "3c  120 is a bulge dominated galaxy which has , most probably , experienced a merging event with a less massive galaxy .",
    "that galaxy was completely disrupted in the merging process , falling in parts which produce , most probably , many of the observed structures @xcite .",
    "this may explain the different stellar populations of the structures and the average stellar population in the object (  4.2 ) as it has been previously reported for other galaxies @xcite .",
    "a subtantial fraction of its gas has been channelled towards the inner regions , following the detected arm - like structure , and concentrating in the e@xmath1 region .",
    "we obtained integral field optical spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 radio galaxy 3c  120 .",
    "the homogeneous data , excellent spatial and spectral coverage , and good spatial and spectral resolution make this atlas a useful tool for studying 3c  120 in the optical .",
    "these ifs optical data were combined with high resolution hst imaging .",
    "the analysis of these data suggests that a seyfert 1 nucleus at the center , an early type galaxy , and several structures formed as a consequence of a merging process in the past history constitute the radio galaxy 3 120 .",
    "at least one of these structures is identified with an inflow , which is feeding the central engine .",
    "a radio - jet is escaping from the center , perturbing the gas on its path .",
    "the main results from the analysis of this dataset were the following :    * several continuum - dominated structures were detected in 3c 120 , which do not follow the mean distribution ( bulge dominated ) of the stellar component .",
    "some of these structures were shells in the central kpc of the object , which may indicate a past merging process .",
    "the colors of the different components were not compatible with a single stellar population in this galaxy . *",
    "three emission line structures were identified ( e@xmath0 , e@xmath1 and e@xmath2 ) which were not associated with the general behavior of the galaxy .",
    "these gaseous structures presented a high level of ionization .",
    "the origin of structure e@xmath0 was the interaction between the intergalactic medium and the radio - jet emerging from the nucleus . *",
    "the spectra of the nucleus and the host galaxy were decoupled , obtaining a data cube of residuals . from that residual data cube",
    ", we extracted and analyzed the spectra of the different structures in 3c 120 . *",
    "the velocity field indicated a rotational component plus several kinematical perturbations associated with the identified emission structures . * the continuum - dominated structures a , b , the s@xmath72 shell and the eelr e@xmath1 seem to be physically associated , belonging to the inner - most part of a tidal - tail , remanent of a past merging event .",
    "this tail has channeled gas into the inner regions , in an inflow , that has generated e@xmath1 .",

    "a new technique to decouple the spectra of different components in an object has been developed , based on well known techniques applied in the decoupling of different components in images .",
    "two different methods have been developed .",
    "a first one is based on a 2d modeling of the objects using object templates , while the second one is based on an isophotal analysis of 2d images .",
    "we explain here how both methods have been extended to the analysis of ifs datacubes , and the advantages of each one .",
    "ifs combines the characteristics of imaging and spectroscopy . in general terms ,",
    "ifs data consist of a series of spectra obtained at a discrete number of positions in the sky . in the case of integral data in the sb2 configuration",
    ", they consist of the 209 spectra obtained in the same number of positions in the sky . newer instruments , like pmas @xcite or vimos @xcite , sample the sky in a continuous way , by coupling the fibres to lens - arrays . in these latter cases",
    "a ifs datacube can be understood as a stack of narrow - band images .",
    "more generally , at each wavelength we have a 2d discrete distribution of fluxes , that can be transformed to a regular grid distribution by an interpolation routine .",
    "it is a quite common situation that an observed object is the combination of different components : e.g. , an qso lens , a crowded - field of stars and an agn+host system .",
    "different techniques have been developed to decouple the different components of an image , and to derive their photometry .",
    "a wide extended technique is to fit the images with a 2d model , including a template for each different component .",
    "this technique is implemented in galfit @xcite , a program for modeling multi - components in images .",
    "this program has been used in the decoupling of nuclear and host components @xcite and the decoupling of different components in a qso lens @xcite .",
    "galfit fits the images with a multi - component model , producing a template image and a residual image .",
    "this residual image can be used to detect substructures in 2d images .    a natural extension of the 2d modeling technique to ifs is to split the datacube in a set of narrow - band images of the width of the spectral pixel ( the so - called monochromatic images ) , and treat them as individual images .",
    "this technique has been used successfully for the deblending of qso lenses with ifs @xcite . in the particular case of our integral data , we first transformed the discrete set of spectra in a regular grid datacube using an interpolation routine implemented in e3d @xcite",
    ". the final datacube has a 0@xmath103@xmath170@xmath103 pixel size , i.e. , 1/3th of the original diameter of the fibers .",
    "the 2d image modeling of the nucleus and the host for each monochromatic image was performed using galfit .",
    "the 2d model comprises a narrow gaussian function ( to model the nucleus ) and a de vaucouleurs law ( to model the galaxy ) , both convolved with a psf .",
    "the psf at each wavelength was obtained from a calibration star datacube , observed just before the object . in a first attempt",
    "all the parameters of the model were fitted : the intensities of the nucleus and the host , the centroid of the object , the effective radius , the position angle and the ellipticity of the host galaxy .",
    "as already noticed by @xcite , this first modeling does not produce acceptable results .",
    "the large number of parameters , the degeneracy between some of them ( e.g. , the total intensity and the scale - length ) , and the limited sampling of our data impose limitations to the quality of the recovered spectra .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that it is possible to increase the quality of the modeling imposing certain conditions in the structural parameters .",
    "the centroid of the object varies through the wavelengths due to differential atmospheric refraction ( dar ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , whenever there is a clear peak in the object ( like in our case ) the centroid should vary smoothly with the wavelength .",
    "figure 15 shows the centroid coordinates as a function of the wavelength resulting from the 3d modeling . despite of the fluctuations , there is a clear trend .",
    "the solid - lines show the result of a fitting a polynomial function of order 5 . in a second run of the 3d modeling we imposed the centroid to be fixed to the result from this polynomial fitting .",
    "similar conditions can be imposed for the ellipticity , effective radius and position angle of the host galaxy . by forcing the structural parameters to vary smoothly with the wavelength and fixing them in the 3d modeling process the number of parameters",
    "is reduced to the intensity of the different components .",
    "thus the accuracy of the modeling is increased @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters can be reduced too if we derive the structural parameters from an external source of information . as we explained above",
    "we have good quality hst images of the object in different bands , that have been already analyzed using galfit (  4.1 ) .",
    "we fixed the structural parameters ( effective radius , ellipticity and position angle ) in our second 3d modeling of the values derived by the 2d modeling of the hst images ( table [ tab_galfit ] ) .",
    "the centroids were fixed to the values derived using the polynomial function shown in fig .",
    "figure 16 illustrates the process .",
    "the top - left panel shows the decoupled spectra of the nucleus and the host derived from the 3d modeling when all the parameters are fitted freely .",
    "the spectra derived from the first run are noisy and can only be considered as a very rough approximation .",
    "the top - right panel shows the spectra once fixed the centroids to the result of the polynomial function fitting shown in fig .",
    "there is a clear increase of the quality of the derived spectra .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows the spectra when , in addition to the centroids , the structural parameters of the host galaxy ( ellipticity , position angle and effective radius ) are fix to the result from a polynomial function fitting similar to the one used for the centroids .",
    "this is the best possible result if we only had the information from the ifs .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the final result , obtained when the structural parameters are fixed to the values derived from the 2d modeling of the hst images .",
    "the derived spectra are remarkable similar to those of the previous case . however , in the previous case it is possible to identify some _ fake _ absorption features in the spectrum of the nucleus coincident with the narrow emission lines ( e.g. , [ oiii]@xmath425007 ) .",
    "we cross - checked the accuracy of the final decoupled spectra by comparing the fluxes derived with that obtained by the 2d modeling of the hst images .",
    "both fluxes agree within @xmath420% .    as we explained above galfit",
    "provides us with a residual image at each wavelength once subtracted the 2d model from each monochromatic image .",
    "we stored and stacked those residual images to create a residual datacube .",
    "the residual datacube is used ( 1 ) to cross - check the accuracy of the fitting , i.e. , no evident fake residuals are found , and ( 2 ) to study the substructures in the object .",
    "figure 17 , left panel , shows a narrow - band image centred in the continuum adjacent to the [ oiii ] emission line ( 5204 - 5246 ) from the residual datacube ( contour - plots ) , together with the residual image obtained by a 2d modeling of the hst f555w - band image ( grayscale ) .",
    "a simple comparison of both images shows that the residuals are remarkable similar outside @xmath42@xmath5 from the nucleus . however , there is a ring structure at @xmath41@xmath105 , @xmath4100 fainter than the nucleus , expecially bright in the s@xmath30 of the nucleus .",
    "this structure coincides somehow with the south - east shell .",
    "however it is worrisome that it is fainter in the north - west , where the s@xmath29 shell is brighter .",
    "taking into account the original size of the fibers ( @xmath40@xmath109 ) and our limited determination of the psf , we think that this ring substructure is an artifact of the 2d modeling .",
    "although it limits the use of the residual datacube to study the properties of the substructures , it does not significantly affect the accuracy of the decoupled spectra .",
    "we developed a second method to create a 3d template of the object that would not depend on the psf determination and without assuming any certain law to describe the intensity profile .",
    "this method is an extension of the isophotal surface brightness analysis technique @xcite .",
    "it looks for the ellipse parameters that better represent the isophotal shape by a fourier analysis of the surface brightness at a certain radius as a function of the eccentric anomaly .",
    "the output is a surface brightness profile of the object ( i.e. , the radial distribution of the intensity ) , and the radial distributions of the centroid , position angle and ellipticity ( understanding radius as semi - major axis of the ellipse ) .",
    "a template of the object is created using these output parameters .",
    "then , a residual of the image is obtained by subtracting this template from the original image .",
    "this technique has been extensively used for the detection of substructures in galaxies for decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we extended this method to analyze substructures in ifs data .",
    "for each monochromatic image we performed an isophotal surface brightness analysis using our own coded routines .",
    "the average centroids , ellipticities , position angles , and the integrated fluxes obtained from this analysis are stored for each wavelength .",
    "the residual images obtained are combined in a residual datacube . like in the previous method the quality of the model template can be increased assuming that the structural parameters change smoothly with the wavelength . the structural parameters for each wavelength",
    "were fixed to the values derived by a polynomial function fitting . in the case of an isophotal analysis ,",
    "once fixed the structural parameters , the derived model for each monochromatic image is just estimated obtaining the average flux at a certain radius along the eccentric anomaly .",
    "i.e. , it is not a fit anymore , but just a direct measurement .",
    "figure 18 illustrates the results of this process .",
    "it shows , in both panels , the integrated spectrum of 3c  120 over the field - of - view of integral ( black line ) , together with the recovered spectrum from the 3d template ( orange line ) , and the integrated spectrum of the residuals .",
    "the left panel shows the result from the first iteration where all the structural parameters are derived by the described method .",
    "in general terms the spectrum of the model matches well the original spectrum , despite some wavelengths where the program is unable to derive the correct parameters .",
    "the right panel shows the result from the second iteration with all the structural parameters fixed , as described above . in this case",
    "the agreement between the recovered and the original spectrum is remarkable good , with no flux deviation higher than a few percent at any wavelength .",
    "as expected this method produces a better quality residual datacube than the 3d modeling .",
    "the basic reason is that we reduced the number of assumptions about the shape of the object and we transformed a fit to a direct measurement .",
    "figure 17 , right panel , shows a similar narrow - band image of the continuum adjacent to [ oiii ] from the residual datacube than the one presented in the left panel , but obtained with the 3d surface brightness analysis .",
    "the grayscale shows once more the residual from the 2d modeling of the f555w - band image .",
    "the residuals from the narrow - band image and the hst data match better than that of the 2d modeling .",
    "no trace of the ring structure is present , which reinforce our idea that it is an spurious result due to a limited sampling and inaccuracies in the psf determination .",
    "the two developed techniques to decoupling spectra of different components from ifs data give successful results .",
    "the first method could be useful to deblend spectra , such in the case of spectra from different components .",
    "the second procedure is more suitable to study the residual structures once the spectrum of the main component is subtracted .      ,",
