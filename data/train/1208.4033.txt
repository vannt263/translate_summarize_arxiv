    "we see that there is rapid convergence as @xmath19 is increased , both in the disordered phase and near criticality , so that the change in @xmath93 is @xmath94 between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "this indicates that the spectrum of the reduced density matrix is no longer dominated by just a small number of eigenvalues .",
    "consequently the dmrg algorithm must retain a larger number of eigenvalues in order to accurately represent the target state with a larger computational penalty . in our dmrg algorithm",
    "whether or not an eigenvalue is kept in each step is controlled by the condition @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a threshold value . for the detailed plots of the energy gap , @xmath73 , and @xmath68 close to criticality ( fig . 5 of the letter )",
    "we found it necessary to decrease @xmath108 by a factor of @xmath109 ( effectively increasing the number of kept states by @xmath110 ) to produce sufficiently accurate results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent_scaling_larger ] we plot data obtained using the larger ( less accurate ) value of @xmath108 .",
    "the effect is most clearly visible for the larger system sizes and especially for the plot of the energy gap , because the first excited state carries more entanglement relative to the ground state and is thus more challenging for the dmrg to represent , reducing the accuracy and rate of convergence .",
    "it was necessary to increase the number of convergence sweeps in the finite volume part of the dmrg routine from @xmath111 for the ground state with @xmath112 to @xmath113 for the first excited with @xmath114 .",

    "we do see however from this computation that as we increase the accuracy of the dmrg computation ( as measured by kept states ) , the crossing points from the finite size scaling of the es and the gap to the first excited state move closer together .",

    "<S> the algorithm works by treating the model in an anisotropic limit : as a mixture of continuum and discrete degrees of freedom , making it amenable to a 1d - like dmrg algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> a major strength of the dmrg approach is that it works directly with the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath5 , the distribution of which governs the entanglement content . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to simultaneously probe a variety of entanglement measures in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> alternative techniques , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , that do not have direct access to @xmath5 , are more restricted .    as a case study </S>",

    "<S> we find that @xmath3 in 2d shares a number of characteristics with 1d  including logarithmic scaling at criticality , in agreement with other studies @xcite  and propose a scaling form to explain our results .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we analyse the entanglement spectrum ( es ) . while the es was first studied as a means to understand the efficacy of the dmrg algorithm @xcite and then as a means of detecting topological order @xcite , it is now being explored in non - topological systems to discover connections between the es and the system s ordinary excitation spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the scaling of the entanglement spectrum can be used to detect the critical point of the 2d system ( a significant numerical advantage over calculating the energy gap ) , a result previously suggested only in 1d @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * model and dmrg algorithm : * we study the 2d quantum ising model as a set of 1d quantum ising chains ( qics ) , each with periodic boundary conditions and of length r , coupled through their spin operator : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a sum over chain index . </S>",

    "<S> we focus on systems built from chains with negative mass ( @xmath14 ) , as in this case one can drive the system to the critical point by increasing the magnitude of the interchain coupling , @xmath15 ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> we employ a dmrg algorithm adapted to studying coupled 1d chains as described in @xcite , treating individual chains as equivalent to individual lattice sites in a conventional dmrg algorithm . as with all dmrg algorithms </S>",
    "<S> , this allows us to readily extract the entanglement entropy and spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> this methodology is based in part on the truncated spectrum approach ( tsa ) to studying perturbed conformal and integrable field theories @xcite . in the tsa </S>",
    "<S> the underlying conformal or integrable theory provides a particularly apt basis in which to study relevant ( in the renormalization group sense ) perturbations . with such perturbations , </S>",
    "<S> the low energy sector of the full theory can be understood as a mixing of the low energy sector of the unperturbed theory ( even if the two energy spectra are dramatically different ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the high energy part of the theory can be neglected by imposing an energy cutoff or taken into account in a variational scheme borrowed from the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite . in the following we use a cutoff , @xmath16 , on the chains .    as with perturbations in the tsa , our dmrg trades on the ability to compute matrix elements of the interchain coupling exactly , i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are two states on a pair of neighbouring chains . </S>",
    "<S> using integrable or conformal 1d chains means we are able to incorporate much of the strongly correlated physics before the numerical analysis has even begun .    </S>",
    "<S> dmrg algorithms in 2d are limited relative to 1d because @xmath3 grows with the length of boundary between blocks ( in this implementation , @xmath19 , the chain length ) @xcite . approaching the thermodynamic limit then requires extrapolation and judicious choices of aspect ratio and boundary conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our use of continuum chains plays an important role in allowing the dmrg algorithm to work successfully . in continuum field theories </S>",
    "<S> , the finite size errors are exponentially suppressed in system size , r @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the chains can be in the thermodynamic limit even for comparatively small @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> keeping r small allows for smaller @xmath3 and hence an efficient dmrg implementation . as a corollary to this </S>",
    "<S> we find we need to keep comparatively few eigenstates of the reduced density matrix , ranging from the 10 s deep in the ordered phase to @xmath20 close to the critical point in order to obtain truncation errors on the order of @xmath21 ( for additional details see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus while the hilbert space of the individual sites ( i.e. the chains ) can involve many hundreds of states , we need to keep far fewer states from the reduced density matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm has been shown to successfully analyze various conventional properties of large arrays of coupled qics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was able to reproduce the scaling form ( in terms of the dimensionless combination @xmath22 ) of the first excited gap in the disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> for this system it is possible to analytically compute the finite chain @xmath19 corrections , and an excellent match with the dmrg numerics was found . </S>",
    "<S> most significantly , the exponent @xmath23 governing the vanishing of the mass gap , @xmath24 , as the critical coupling is approached , i.e. @xmath25 , was computed . </S>",
    "<S> it was found to be @xmath26 , in good agreement with the accepted value , @xmath27 and with a tensor based method @xcite , for the 3d classical ising model , demonstrating that the method successfully captures the physics of the 2d quantum system .     as a function of the number of chains , n , in the disordered phase and near criticality . </S>",

    "<S> . this scaling form must take into account the universal and the non - universal ( i.e. cutoff , @xmath16 , dependent ) contribution to the area law as well as a subleading universal logarithmic contribution that we believe we have detected in our numerics . </S>",
    "<S> we allow this log to be dependent on the system aspect ratio ( akin to that for 2d cqcp @xcite ) - a necessity if we insist on matching perturbation theory away from criticality . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling form we adopt is then @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a non - universal constant , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular to the chains , respectively , and @xmath32 is a scaling function </S>",
