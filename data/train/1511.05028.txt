    "traversable lorentzian wormholes ( morris et al . 1988 ) are theoretical objects with a throat that connects two regions of the same universe or two different universes .",
    "they are characterized by being threaded by matter that violates the null energy condition and its amount can be arbitrarily small at the cost of increasing the pressure at the throat .",
    "a particular class of wormholes can be obtained by using the thin - shell formalism , i.e. by cutting and pasting two manifolds to construct a new one , with a shell at the joining surface corresponding to the throat ( poisson et al . 1995 ) , which must fulfill the flare - out condition .",
    "born - infeld electrodynamics is a non - linear theory proposed in order to avoid the infinite self energies of charged point particles arising in maxwell theory .",
    "born - infeld type actions have appeared in low energy string theory , leading to an increasing interest in non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "the field equations obtained from the action of born - infeld electrodynamics coupled to einstein gravity have the spherically symmetric vacuum solution ( bretn 2002 ) : @xmath0 @xmath1 \\right\\rbrace , \\label{psibi}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 the mass , @xmath3 the charge , and @xmath4 the elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "from the geometry ( [ metricabi ] ) we construct the thin - shell wormholes , by using the darmois - israel formalism ( israel 1966 ) .",

    "we let @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the proper time on the shell , and we take @xmath9 larger than the horizon radius @xmath10 , in order to avoid the presence of the horizons and the singularity in the new manifold .",
    "the einstein equations on the shell can be reduced to lanczos equations that relate the extrinsic curvature with the surface stress - energy tensor @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the surface energy density and @xmath13 , @xmath14 the transverse pressures , from which we obtain @xmath15 @xmath16 . \\label{e10}\\ ] ] from eq .",

    "the generalized chaplygin gas has been adopted in current cosmology studies in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
