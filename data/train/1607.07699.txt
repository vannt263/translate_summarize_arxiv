    "supershells are large gaseous shells of radius greater than a few hundred parsecs .",
    "they are distinct from other shell - like structures in their extraordinarily large energy requirement , i.e. , @xmath3  erg , which corresponds to @xmath4 supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite .",
    "about twenty supershells have been found in the milky way , and numerous neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) holes corresponding to supershells have been discovered in nearby dwarfs and spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "these gigantic structures are generally thought to arise from multiple sn explosions in stellar ob associations .",
    "but most supershells are missing a stellar association in their interior , and the number of supershells and their energies are usually incompatible with the level of star formation in those galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , several alternative scenarios have been proposed , the most popular of which is the collision of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) with the disk @xcite .",
    "hvcs are  clouds with radial velocities very different from the disk material in the milky way , e.g. , with a deviation more than 50  from the range of permitted velocities in a simple model of the distribution and rotation of the  gas in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "some large hvc complexes are known to be gas streams tidally stripped from satellite galaxies of the milky way , but the origin of isolated compact hvcs ( chvcs ) remain controversial : they could be clouds formed from galactic fountain or intergalactic accreting flows , part of the large hvc complexes , or condensations in the multi - phase circumgalactic medium @xcite .",
    "the hvc origin has been proposed for a few supershells @xcite , but there has been no clear example showing a direct link between the two , particularly for chvcs .    here",
    "we report the detection of a galactic supershell with an associated hvc , gs040.2 + 00.6@xmath170 ( hereafter gs040 ) .",
    "gs040 was first identified as a faint , forbidden - velocity wing feature ( fvw  40.0 + 0.5 ) in the low - resolution , large - scale longitude - velocity study of @xcite .",
    "we have found that gs040 appears to be a complete circular ring with complicated structures inside in our high - resolution i - galfa ( inner - galaxy alfa )  21-cm line survey data .",
    "the i - galfa survey is a survey of the first galactic quadrant visible to arecibo ( @xmath5 to 77  and @xmath6 ) done by using the 7-beam arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) receiver on the arecibo 305  m telescope , and it provides sensitive ( @xmath7  k ) and fully - sampled  maps at spatial and spectral resolutions of 4  and 0.184  , respectively @xcite .",
    "the i - galfa survey data further reveal that there is a chvc at the very center of gs040 .",
    "this chvc , named hvc 040 + 01@xmath1282 ( hereafter chvc040 ) , was first identified in the leiden / dwingeloo survey @xcite and was later classified as an isolated chvc by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a higher - resolution ( 9 )  image obtained from the effelsberg telescope , which showed that chvc040 has a pronounced head - tail structure .",
    "our arecibo  images reveal detailed spatial and velocity structure of chvc040 strongly suggesting its association with the supershell gs040 .",
    "we describe two structures in section  [ sec : targets ] , and discuss their physical characteristics and their association together with some implications on the disruption of hvcs in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the supershell gs040 is centered at @xmath8 and clearly visible from @xmath9 to @xmath10  . in an integrated intensity map ( figure [ fig : itg_gs040 ] )",
    ", gs040 appears as a complete circular ring of radius @xmath11 with complicated structures inside .",
    "more detailed structures can be seen in figure  [ fig : chmap_gs040 ] , which presents velocity channel maps . at the most negative velocities ( @xmath12  )",
    ", we see diffuse emission with embedded knotty filaments near the center and an extended filament in the south .",
    "the features are observable at even more negative velocities ( @xmath13  @xmath14  ) but they are extremely weak and hard to detect in velocity - channel maps . as the velocity increases ( @xmath15  ) , the nebulosity fades out , and a larger ( @xmath16 ) ring structure appears , which resembles a cartwheel with a bright central `` hub '' and several `` spokes '' ( see also figure  [ fig : itg_gs040 ] ) .",
    "the size of the ring increases slightly with velocity indicating that the ring structure is an approaching portion of an expanding shell . at velocities greater than about @xmath10  ,",
    "the galactic background  emission becomes dominant , and the emission associated with gs040 is less clear .    at the very center of gs040",
    "is the hvc chvc040 .",
    "the positional coincidence of chvc040 with the gs040 s central hub is striking as can be seen in figure  [ fig : pvmap ] , which is the position - velocity map crossing the center of gs040 .",
    "the morphological agreement between the two is also noticeable .",
    "our high - resolution arecibo  image reveals that chvc040 has a blunt cone shape with a steep southwestern boundary and a faint envelope flaring out northeast ( figure  [ fig : hvc ] ) .",
    "this morphology of chvc040 matches well with that of the central hub of gs040 , e.g. , see figure  [ fig : itg_gs040 ] and also the channel map at @xmath17  in figure  [ fig : chmap_gs040 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : hvc ] shows the detailed spatial and velocity structures of chvc040 .",
    "the integrated intensity map in the left frame shows that chvc040 has a bright , @xmath18- sized `` core '' elongated along the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "the core appears to be composed of several clumps with a sharp boundary at southwest , whereas the diffuse envelope appears to be slightly more extended toward southeast .",
    "the mean  column density , assuming that the emission is optically thin , is 1.5@xmath19 while the peak  column density is about two times higher .",
    "the velocity centroid map in the middle frame shows that systemic velocity attains its most negative ( @xmath20  ) at the southwestern boundary and most positive ( @xmath21  ) along the southeastern boundary and also in the middle of the northwestern boundary .",
    "the mean systematic velocity is @xmath22  .",
    "if the most positive feature in the northwestern boundary were not present , the velocity structure could have been suggestive of a rotation with respect to the northeast - southwest symmetry axis at speed of @xmath23  .",
    "the velocity width ( full width at half maximum ; fwhm ) ranges 2545  over most parts of the cloud with a median of 36  .",
    "the southwesternmost thin layer has relatively narrow width ( @xmath241928  ) while parts of the northern area has width @xmath25  .",
    "the region with the narrowest line width is very thin ( @xmath26 ) , and therefore @xcite could not spatially resolve it .",
    "some representative line profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : hvc_prf ] together with the average line profile of the cloud .",
    "most profiles are well described with a single gaussian component , while some profiles , e.g. , c and e - g , show clear double peaks or a narrow component superposed on a broad component .",
    "the velocity width of the mean profile is 45  , which is considerably larger than the median value ( 36  ) of individual profiles , presumably due to the dispersion of central velocities .",
    "the median width corresponds to a kinetic temperature of @xmath27  k. at several positions , narrow velocity components are detected , but still their widths are @xmath28  , which implies a kinetic temperature @xmath29  k. this indicates that chvc040 is mostly composed of warm neutral gas , which is not unusual for chvcs @xcite .",
    "but it is different from those head - tail hvcs with a narrow - line head of undisturbed cold  gas and a wide - line tail of disturbed warm  gas ( e.g. , hvc125 + 41 - 207 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the location of chvc040 at the geometrical center of gs040 suggests that their physical association is very likely .",
    "the centroids of the chvc emission and that of the gs040 s hub emission overlap within @xmath30  degrees .",
    "the probability of this being a random alignment is @xmath31 , and multiplying this by @xmath32 chvcs yields an overall probability of @xmath33 for any chvc aligning this well with the gs040 s hub .",
    "no intermediate - velocity  connecting the two is apparent ( figure  [ fig : pvmap ] ) , but this could be because the gas is ionized .",
    "we searched for a warm ionized gas associated with gs040 using the wisconsin h@xmath34 mapper northern sky survey ( wham - nss ) data @xcite .",
    "the survey has an angular resolution of 1 , and , around the gs040 area , it provides h@xmath34 spectra covering @xmath35 from @xmath36 to @xmath37  at spectral resolutions of 12  .",
    "we have examined the h@xmath34 intensity map integrated over the velocity range of gs040 ( @xmath36 to @xmath38  ) , but could not detect an associated emission ( @xmath39 0.05  @xmath40 where @xmath41 ) .",
    "note that this area is bright in the total h@xmath34 intensity map with a mean intensity of about 3  @xmath40 , so that we do not expect to see the faint emission associated with either gs040 or chvc040 in the all - sky h@xmath34 maps @xcite .",
    "we also searched for an associated hot ionized gas using the 0.1 - 2.4 kev image of the rosat all - sky x - ray survey ( 1 pixel scale = 44 ; * ? ? ? * ) , but could nt detect any emission .",
    "chvc040 belongs to the `` galactic center negative '' ( gcn ) hvc complex , which is a collection of small discrete hvcs sparsely distributed over a @xmath42 area within @xmath43 to @xmath44 and @xmath45 to 10@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "a kinematic model has been proposed where gcn is a smooth gas flow starting at @xmath45 at a heliocentric distance of 35  kpc and crossing the galactic plane obliquely at 15  kpc @xcite . for comparison",
    ", gs040 is probably located near the scutum - centaurus ( sct - cen ) arm at a distance of @xmath47  kpc @xcite because the disrupted interstellar medium ( ism ) is seen only at velocities below that of the sct - cen arm ( @xmath48  ) , not at higher velocities ( see figures  [ fig : chmap_gs040 ] and [ fig : pvmap ] ) .",
    "we examined lists of known stellar objects ,  regions , ob stars , and sn remnants ( snrs ) , but no known sources are likely to be associated with gs040 .",
    "there is one  region ( g@xmath49 ) in the _ wise _ catalog of galactic  regions @xcite that is located at @xmath50 west of the hub . but",
    "this  region has a systematic velocity of @xmath51  @xcite and is enclosed by a small ( 68 ) dust shell , so it can not be responsible for the hi shell . instead the distance of @xmath47  kpc is not unreasonable for chvc040 , because gcn does not have a smooth extended envelope like other hvc complexes , and it appears to be composed of several subpopulations that do not share a common origin @xcite .",
    "note that the geometrical center of gs040 is well below the galactic plane ( @xmath52  pc where @xmath53 ) , i.e. , at @xmath54 while the midplane there is at @xmath55 because the galactic plane is warped in the outer galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to imagine the sn origin for a supershell at such height , and chvc040 is most likely the energy / momentum source for gs040 .",
    "the total energy deposited ( @xmath56 ) in the galactic disk by chvc040 can be inferred from the parameters of the gs040 supershell .",
    "the radius of gs040 is @xmath57  pc , while its mass at @xmath58  is @xmath59   including the cosmic abundance of helium .",
    "if we account for the mass unobservable due to galactic background  emission , the total mass of gs040 would be considerably greater .",
    "adopting @xmath60  as the expansion speed of the shell , its kinetic energy is @xmath61  erg .",
    "the collision should have occurred @xmath62  yr ago , where the numerical factor @xmath63 accounts for the deceleration of the shell . note that @xmath64 is a small fraction of the total energy deposited ( @xmath56 ) ,",
    "most of which should have been radiated away . if gs040 was produced by multiple sne , then , assuming instantaneous energy injection @xcite , @xmath65  erg , where @xmath66 is ambient hydrogen density . at the position of gs040 , the mean  density in the midplane is @xmath67 , and the  scale height is about 720  pc @xcite .",
    "so @xmath68 , and we have @xmath69  erg . for comparison , the total extent of chvc040 is @xmath70 while its  mass is @xmath71  .",
    "the area used to derive this mass has a geometrical mean radius of 150  pc , so that the mean hydrogen density of chvc040 is 0.017  @xmath72 .",
    "if chvc040 collided with the rotating disk with the mean ` deviation ' speed ( absolute difference in velocity from the disk gas there ) of hvcs , i.e. , @xmath73  @xcite , the kinetic energy and momentum would be @xmath74  ergs and @xmath75  including the he abundance , respectively .",
    "this implies that the mass of chvc040 when it collided with the disk should have been an order of magnitude greater and that the hvc that we see ( chvc040 ) might be the remains of the original hvc .",
    "the spatial morphology and velocity structure of chvc040 suggest that it is moving southwest in the plane of the sky and is approaching us .",
    "the steep southwestern boundary of the cloud might represent the region compressed by the interaction with the ambient medium , whereas the diffuse envelope might be the material stripped off from the cloud due to the interaction or by the ram pressure of the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the small velocity width along the southwestern boundary and large velocity width beyond appear to be consistent with such speculation .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that , for a chvc with head - tail structure , the inclination angle , i.e. , the angle between the chvc s trajectory and the line - of - sight , can be derived from the asymmetry in position - velocity diagram along the head - tail line crossing the center of mass .",
    "the morphology of chvc040 is different from typical head - tail chvcs , i.e. , chvc040 has a wide flaring ` tail ' not a narrow elongated tail ( see also   2 ) , and its core is fragmented , so that it is not obvious if their model can be applied .",
    "nevertheless if we assume that the center of mass is near the southwestern boundary and apply their model ( their equations 14 ) to the position - velocity diagram along the red - dashed line in figure 1 , we obtain an inclination angle of @xmath76 which is consistent with our expectation .",
    "the shape of chvc040 appears to be pointed away from the galactic midplane as if it already went through the midplane .",
    "but the geometrical center of the supershell coincides with the current location of chvc040 , not being located in the midplane .",
    "perhaps chvc040 is approaching at an angle to the warped galactic disk and has not yet fully penetrated the disk to the midplane .",
    "it is worth to note that , according to the @xcite s model , the gcn hvc stream is colliding to the galactic plane almost perpendicularly _ from below _ , while the head - tail directions of individual hvcs seem to indicate that there is no preferential direction in their motions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the orbit of chvc040 is uncertain . the colliding geometry and the origin of the complex structures such as the hub and spokes in gs040 need to be explored .",
    "there are about three hundred known chvcs in the milky way @xcite .",
    "a considerable fraction of chvcs has a head - tail structure indicating a ram pressure interaction with the diffuse galactic halo gas @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether they are totally dissipated in the galactic halo to feed the multi - phase circumgalactic medium or they can survive their trip through the halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since chvc040 is located in the far outer galaxy , it may be of extragalactic origin rather than originating from a galactic fountain , although it is not clear whether chvc040 was originally a fragment of a nearby tidally disrupted galaxy or a cold cloud formed in a larger accreting flow of ionized , low - metallicity intergalactic gas .",
    "our result then directly shows that at least some chvcs of extragalactic origin do survive and collide with the galactic disk .",
    "according to numerical studies , chvcs with  masses @xmath77   would be totally disrupted in the galactic halo unless they are embedded in dark matter @xcite .",
    "but dynamical shielding by an extended diffuse gaseous component can significantly extend their lifetime @xcite .",
    "we have checked whether there are additional sources like the chvc040-gs040 system in the i - galfa  data using the hvc catalog of @xcite .",
    "there are twelve chvcs in their table  2 including chvc040 in the i - galfa survey area , most of which are at relatively high latitudes .",
    "they are isolated hvcs and have @xmath78  , so they belong to the gcn hvc complex .",
    "we see low - velocity  features around some chvcs , but none of them appear associated .",
    "a systematic study against all chvcs may reveal other chvc - supershell systems .",
