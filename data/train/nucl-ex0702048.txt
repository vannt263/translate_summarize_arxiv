    "one of the primary focus of the rhic program is to study the properties of the strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) with high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) jet and dijets .",
    "the properties of the plasma can be deduced in two ways : on the one hand , the suppression of single jets and di - jets signals at high @xmath0 tells us about the stopping power or the transport properties of the medium . on the other hand ,",
    "study the the response of the medium to the jets , especially their energy dissipation in the medium , can reveal the collective properties or equilibration process of the medium .",
    "the studies of two particle azimuth correlation at rhic have revealed detailed information on the jet interaction with the medium , beyond what we learned from the single particle spectra measurements .",
    "experimentally , any deviations of the correlation pattern in heavy - ion collisions from that in baseline p+p collisions are attributed to some sort of medium effects .",
    "such deviations are found to be dependent on the @xmath0 of the trigger hadrons ( @xmath2 ) and partner hadrons ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : pic ] show a schematic sketch of the landscape of the two particle correlations in @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "based on existing experimental results and theoretical calculations , the while @xmath0 range is divided into four regions , each of which is probably sensitive to different physics . at high",
    "@xmath0 , star  @xcite shows that the away side jet magnitude is suppressed by factor of 4 - 5 relative to p+p , but maintaining a relatively unmodified shape .",
    "it is consistent with the fragmentation of the primary jets that survives the medium either through tangential emission  @xcite or punching - through mechanisms  @xcite or both  @xcite . at intermediate @xmath0 range(1 - 4 gev/@xmath4 ) , the away side jet is broadened  @xcite or even concave like  @xcite in shape but its amplitude is enhanced relative to p+p  @xcite .",
    "the features were believe to be the consequence of the response of the medium to the energy degradation of the high @xmath0 jets .",
    "many theoretical scenarios have been proposed in the last few years to describe the energy dissipation processes , including gluon radiation  @xcite , cherenkov radiation  @xcite , `` mach shock '' mechanism  @xcite . but deflected jet pictures such as hydrodynamical wake  @xcite or multiple scattering of the jet by the medium  @xcite were proposed as well .",
    "the first two models require additional particle production , whereas the other models require redistribution of the momentum / energy among existing particles .    in between these two @xmath0 regions , experimental data",
    "show an suppressed and possibly very flat away side with no visible peak structure  @xcite .",
    "this region ( we call moderately high @xmath0 region ) could have contributions from both jet fragmentation and responses of the medium .",
    "the flat but still positive structure could be the combined result of a fragmentation contribution concentrated around @xmath5 and a medium contribution centered at 1 radian away from @xmath6 .",
    "the flat structure probably implies the two components have roughly equal yield at this @xmath0 region .",
    "lastly is the low @xmath0 region . in most jet quenching models",
    "@xcite , the bremsstrahlung radiation was believed to be largely contained in a narrow angular range ( 0.5 rad ) around the jet axis .",
    "these gluons might be the precursor of the collective medium response , but it is also conceivable that some gluons simply thermalized with the medium after additional scattering . in this picture , one would also expect an enhancement in the region around @xmath6 at low @xmath0 and it should have an exponential thermal shape .",
    "given that the correlation patterns depend strongly on the @xmath0 of both particles in the pairs , it is crucial to map out the awayside jet properties in a broad @xmath0 range and to identify the transition regions between different correlation patterns .",
    "we focus separately on the high @xmath0 region , which is ideal for studying jet quenching and jet tomography , and on intermediate @xmath0 region , which is dominated by the medium response .",
    "phenix results on hadron - hadron , identified hadron - hadron and three particle correlation are discussed in this context , with an emphasize on new results we have shown in qm2006 .",
    "in correlation analysis , one correlate hadrons in one @xmath0 region ( `` trigger '' ) with those in another @xmath0 window ( `` partner '' ) .",
    "the hadron pairs from same jet tend to appear at @xmath7 and those from for back - to - back dijet tend to appear at @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in the partner yield distribution per - trigger , @xmath9 ( pty ) , which is defined in a way similar to the previous @xmath10 and @xmath11 analysis@xcite : @xmath12 with the additional @xmath13 term to take into account the flow modulation of the background pairs in au+au collisions .",
    "@xmath14 is the number of trigger , @xmath15 is the efficiency for associated hadrons in full azimuth and in @xmath16 pseudo - rapidity . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are same - event pair and mixed - event pair distributions , respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath19 and @xmath20 stands for the trigger and partner particles .",
    "@xmath21 is a normalization factor which is the ratio of the combinatorics pairs in the same event to those in the mixed event .",
    "@xmath21 is typically bigger but very close to 1 .",
    "fig.[fig : shape ] shows the pty for various combination of trigger and partner @xmath0 in central au+au collisions , in comparison with p+p .",
    "the partner @xmath0 is constrained to be less than trigger @xmath0 . from left to right and top to bottom , the @xmath0 ranges of one or both particles increase , going from @xmath22 gev/@xmath4 ( trigger @xmath0 vs partner @xmath0 ) to @xmath23 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the solid lines around the points represent the error due to the elliptic flow uncertainty , which peaks at 0 and @xmath6 and is the dominating error at @xmath24 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the shaded bands indicate the error due to uncertainty on the background level which is fixed by the zero yield at minimum ( zyam ) method  @xcite .",
    "this error depends on the statistical uncertainty at the zyam minimum and is the dominating at @xmath25 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the top row shows the jet yield in three successive partner @xmath0 ranges covering 0.4 to 3 gev/@xmath4 with trigger @xmath0 fixed in 3 - 4 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the away side jet shapes are dramatic different between au+au and p+p .",
    "the p+p data always peak at @xmath6 ; the au+au data show a concave shape with a dip around @xmath6 and two side peaks around 1 radian from @xmath6 .",
    "the concaveness grows with increasing partner @xmath0 , however the location of the side peaks is not changing . to characterize the distorted away side jet shape",
    ", we divided the away side into a `` head '' region ( @xmath26 ) and a `` shoulder '' region ( @xmath27 ) , as illustrated in fig.1c .",
    "they are so named because for normal jet as in p+p , the `` head '' region contains bulk of the jet fragmentation , whereas the `` shoulder '' contains the tail of the jet fragmentation and the radiative contribution .",
    "the `` head '' region is sensitive to the level of jet quenching while the  shoulder  region is suitable for studying the medium response",
    ". clearly , the behavior of the au+au data in the two regions are dramatically different from that of p+p . namely there a suppression in the `` head '' region and an enhancement in the `` shoulder '' region .",
    "the suppression in the `` head '' region sets in around 1 gev/@xmath4 and grows with larger partner @xmath0 , while the enhancement in the `` shoulder '' region persists up to 4 gev/@xmath4 .    in the bottom panels of fig.[fig : shape ] , as the @xmath0 of both hadrons",
    "are further increased , the awayside `` displaced '' peaks in au+au data seem to be compressed relative to p+p and the au+au near side .",
    "this reflects the fact that the away side yield drops faster than the near side with increasing partner @xmath0 . in 4 - 5",
    "gev/@xmath4 bin , the au+au away side is broader than p+p but is no concave . at the highest @xmath0 bin ( 5 - 10 gev/@xmath4 ) , the away side turns into a convex shape , similar in shape to p+p but it s magnitude is largely suppressed .",
    "note that medium modification is on the pairs .",
    "thus the shape of the away side should be symmetric with respect to the trigger @xmath0 and partner @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[fig : shape ] suggests that the away side can be categorized in following four regions depends on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 based on its shape : 1 ) a flat region at @xmath2 or @xmath28 gev/@xmath4 ; 2 ) a concave shape region at @xmath29 gev/@xmath4 ; 3 ) a convex region @xmath30 gev/@xmath4 ; 4 ) a transition region ( almost flat away side ) @xmath31 gev/@xmath4 @xmath32 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "phenix have tried different methods to quantify the behavior of the away side concave shape at intermediate @xmath0 . the location of the side peaks are characterized by `` d ''  @xcite : the distance of the peak to @xmath6 .",
    "`` d '' is found by triple gauss function fit of the away side : @xmath33 fig.[fig : d ] show d for several collision systems and collisions energies .",
    "the position of the peaks was found to be around 1 radian from @xmath6 independent of the centrality ( @xmath34100 ) , collision energy and system size .",
    "in addition , `` d '' was found to be relatively insensitive to the change of partner @xmath0  @xcite , which is also confirmed in fig.[fig : shape ] .",
    "this suggests that `` d '' reflects some kind of universal properties of the medium , such as the speed of sound as suggested by the mach cone mechanism .",
    "it ca nt be described by cherenkov gluon radiation models  @xcite or most of the deflected jet models such as hydrodynamical wake  @xcite or markov random scattering  @xcite .",
    "such mechanisms would predict narrowing of the peak angle with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "phenix also try to characterize the convexity of the away side jet shape with the ratio of average jet yield in the `` head '' region to that in the `` shoulder '' region , @xmath35 , @xmath36 each of the distribution in fig.[fig : shape ] produces one value of @xmath35 that captures essence the the away side jet shape . in general , one expect @xmath37 for a concave shape , @xmath38 for a flat distribution and @xmath39 for a convex shape . thus @xmath40 is an ideal quantity for studying the transition between the `` shoulder '' dominated region to `` head '' dominated region in @xmath0 .",
    "note @xmath35 is purely a shape variable , thus it is symmetric with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath41 .    fig.[fig : ratio ] summarize the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence of @xmath35 in p+p and central au+au collisions .",
    "it is presented in fine bins of partner @xmath42 for three trigger @xmath42 regions .",
    "the wide red shaded error bars represent the elliptic flow error , which is correlated in @xmath0 ; the narrow green shaded bar represent the zyam error , which can vary from point to point . in p+p collisions , @xmath35 is always above one and increases with @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the away side is always peaked around @xmath6 in p+p and its width narrows with increasing @xmath3 . the same ratio in 0 - 5% central au+au collisions are drastically different . for trigger @xmath0 in 2 - 3 gev/@xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath35 decrease from around 1 at @xmath28 gev/@xmath4 to a level of @xmath43 at 3 - 4 gev/@xmath4 . for trigger @xmath0 in 4 - 5",
    "gev/@xmath4 , the decrease of @xmath35 is less significant .",
    "the level at low partner @xmath0 is around 1 , relatively insensitive to the trigger @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that away side is flat at low partner @xmath0 independent of the trigger @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[fig : shape ] suggests that not only the away side jet shape but also the jet multiplicities are modified in central au+au collisions relative to that in p+p .",
    "the modifications depend on trigger @xmath0 , partner @xmath0 and @xmath44 and can be quantified by @xmath45 , the ratio of pty in au+au to that in @xmath11 within a certain @xmath44 window w : @xmath46 the top panels fig.[fig : inte ] show the @xmath45 as function of partner @xmath0 at away side ( @xmath47 ) for three trigger @xmath0 bins .",
    "@xmath45 is greater than 1 at low partner @xmath0 but drops towards high partner @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that central au+au data have a significant enhancement at low partner @xmath0 and a strong suppression at high partner @xmath0 . for higher trigger @xmath0 ,",
    "the enhancement at low partner @xmath0 is smaller and the suppression at high partner @xmath0 is stronger .",
    "the point where @xmath45 cross 1 shifts to lower partner @xmath0 , indicating a stronger decrease of @xmath45 in partner @xmath0 for higher trigger @xmath0 .",
    "the observed @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence is a consequence of the competition between the enhancement in the `` shoulder '' region and the suppression in the `` head '' region shown in fig.[fig : shape ] . at low @xmath3 ,",
    "the away side is ( thus @xmath45 ) is dominated by the `` shoulder '' region ; at sufficiently high @xmath3 , the away side is dominated by the `` head '' region .",
    "the point where @xmath48 would depend on both trigger and partner @xmath0 . for 4 - 5 gev/@xmath4 trigger",
    ", the suppression level seems to saturates around 0.3 at @xmath49 , close to the @xmath50 value for 4 - 5 gev/@xmath4 inclusive hadrons .",
    "the bottom panels of fig.[fig : shape ] show the @xmath45 as function of partner @xmath0 at away side ( @xmath51 ) for the same three trigger @xmath0 bins .",
    "we see similar enhancement at low partner @xmath0 , and the enhancement diminishes towards high partner @xmath0 . as one increase",
    "the trigger @xmath0 , the dependence on partner @xmath0 weakens , and the @xmath45 distributions become flatter in partner @xmath0 .",
    "the near side enhancement has been observed by star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite , this enhancement was attributed by star to the a ridge contribution which extends out in @xmath52 up to @xmath53 .",
    "the ridge contribution seen by star in @xmath54<1.7 is about factor of three compare to the pure jet contribution , and was argued to be reason for the near side enhancement . the enhancement seen in phenix is smaller than observed in star , because of the ridge yield in phenix s limited @xmath55 acceptance is smaller .",
    "the decrease of the enhancement with increasing trigger @xmath0 suggests that the ridge component is softer than the jet component .",
    "the @xmath0 range where the ridge yield is important seems to be in @xmath56 gev/@xmath4 , very similar to the range for the enhancement at the away side .",
    "phenix have also observed a broadening of the near side jet width in central au+au collisions  @xcite at intermediate @xmath0 , the broadening was found to disappear at high trigger @xmath0",
    "@xcite ( also see fig.[fig : scan ] ) .",
    "these observations are summarized in fig.[fig : width ] .",
    "the width results are also suggestive of a ridge contribution that is important at intermediate @xmath0 but disappears at large @xmath0 . due to its limited @xmath55 acceptance , phenix",
    "so far havent be able to observe the ridge signature directly .",
    "however , the detailed study of near side jet shape and yield in broad @xmath0 range can provides indirect but still valuable constrains on the properties of the ridge .",
    "phenix have carried out the intermediate @xmath0 correlation analysis at both @xmath57 and 62.4 gev  @xcite .",
    "ceres also carried out similar analysis at @xmath58 gev selection  @xcite .",
    "the results from the three collision energies for @xmath59 gev/@xmath4 are summarized in the fig.[fig : jetsqrt ] .",
    "the middle panel  @xcite shows the `` jet fraction '' , so the scale ca nt be compared directly with the other two panels which show the per - trigger yield .",
    "but the jet shape can be directly compared among the three distributions .",
    "fig.[fig : jetsqrt ] indicate a clear modification of away side jet at all energies .",
    "they all have displaced peaks around 1 radian from @xmath6 , the concaveness of the away side distributions seems to decrease for lower @xmath1 .",
    "since the trigger selection are similar , we expect the away side jet energy would be mostly determined by the trigger @xmath0 , modulo a weak @xmath1 dependence of the trigger bias ( reflected by @xmath60 ) due to the @xmath1 dependence of the parton spectra shape",
    ". ceres time projection chamber @xmath55 range is 2.1 - 2.7 in lab frame , which corresponds to 0.1 - 0.7 in cm frame .",
    "thus its rapidity range is 0.6 and is close to phenix range of 0.7 .",
    "thus the jet yield at 17.3 gev can be compared directly with that at 200 gev after multiplied by 0.7/0.6 = 1.17 to correct for the difference in @xmath55 acceptance .",
    "the maximum and minimum value is 0.17 and 0.07 for 0 - 5% central au+au collisions at 200 gev ( fig.[fig : jetsqrt]a ) and 0.08 and 0.07 for 0 - 5% pb+pb collisions at 17.3 gev after the acceptance correlation ( fig.[fig : jetsqrt]c ) .",
    "thus the amplitude of the displaced peak in ceres is about factor 2 lower than phenix value , whereas the level at the `` head '' region in ceres is surprisingly close to phenix value .",
    "this probably suggests that the yield in the `` head '' region is dominated by fragments from jet .",
    "the jet multiplicity are somewhat higher at rhic due to smaller @xmath61 , but jet quenching is stronger at rhic than that in sps .",
    "the yield at `` shoulder '' region is significantly smaller at sps than at rhic , possibly suggesting a weaker medium effect .",
    "clearly detailed study of the @xmath1 dependence of the `` head '' and `` shoulder '' yield can provide crucial constrains on interplay between jet quenching and medium response .",
    "phenix also obtained some interesting but puzzling results for correlations between very low @xmath0 hadrons ( @xmath62 gev/@xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : lowpt1 ] shows azimuthal correlation in 0 - 5% au+au collisions for like - sign pairs ( left ) and unlike - sign pairs ( right ) .",
    "the like - sign correlation shows a near side peak consistent with hbt correlation , whereas unlike - sign correlation does not .",
    "what is surprising is the observation of a displaced peak at a location that is consistent with what has been observed for high @xmath0 correlation . whether it has the same physics origin is not clear .",
    "if this is due to correlation between soft particle in the jets or mini - jets , why the unlike - sign correlation does not show any enhancement at the near side as well ( the ridge argument ) ?",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the displaced peak mostly concentrated in a very narrow window of @xmath63 and that the peak only shows up in large @xmath64 and is insensitive to the collision energy .",
    "it is observed at 0 - 5% au+au at 62.4 gev but not in central cu+cu collisions at 200 or 62.4 gev",
    ". further characterization of the shape and yield of this away side peak is underway to clarify the picture .",
    "three - particle correlation can provide direct topological features on the interaction of the jets with the medium , thus potentially allows clear distinction of various modification patterns such as mach - cones and deflected jets which ca nt be directly differentiated with two particle correlation method .",
    "there are four independent angular variables among the three particles , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "if one is mainly interested in the azimuthal correlation , as is done in star  @xcite and in earlier phenix measurements  @xcite , then there are only two independent variable @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "recently phenix has chosen to characterize three particle correlations through the use a local polar coordinate system where the trigger direction is the z axis ( see insert of fig.[fig:3p ] )  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the four independent variables are @xmath70,@xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that the coordinate system is defined for each trigger so it changes trigger by trigger relative to the global frame . in the data analysis ,",
    "phenix chose @xmath74 and @xmath75 as the two independent variables .",
    "these two variables combine the information of all four angles , thus provide a very different way of presenting the jet signal .    left panel of fig.[fig:3p ] shows the resulting three - particle correlation function in @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the soft - soft and soft - hard flow backgrounds have been subtracted , but it still includes the 2 + 1 ( two particles from di - jet and one from background ) flow background .",
    "it is important to note that this correlation function as generated also contains the effect of the phenix acceptance .",
    "one can see three peaks in the ring region ( @xmath78 rad ) between the two gray circles , located at @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these peaks were not observed for simulation where only normal di - jet is included , thus are signatures for the medium effects . after removing the 2 + 1 flow contributions , right panel of fig.[fig:3p ] shows the projection along the ring on the @xmath77 axis , together with expectation of simplistic cone jet and deflected jet scenarios given by monte - carlo simulations . in both scenarios ,",
    "one expected a narrow peak around @xmath79 and a broad peak around @xmath81 .",
    "the difference is that the deflected jet scenario predicts a bigger jet amplitude at @xmath79 than that for the cone jet . from right panel of fig.[fig:3p ] , it appears that the phenix measurements are most consistent with the excitation of a mach cone in the medium and not consistent with a deflected jet hypothesis .",
    "previous results indicate that the jet properties at the nearside , awayside `` head '' and awayside `` shoulder '' regions are quite different .",
    "the near side is consist of a ridge component along @xmath52 and a jet fragmentation contribution .",
    "the awayside `` shoulder '' region is dominated by collective medium response and the `` head '' region seems to be consist of jet fragmentation plus possible feedback from the radiated gluons . given the complexity of the problem and many theoretical possibilities , one need additional handles to test this picture .",
    "correlation with identified particles can reveal the composition or the chemistry of the jet yield in the three regions , thus provide valuable constraints on the underlying physics .",
    "fig.[fig : id3 ] shows the partner meson and baryon yield in 1 - 1.3 gev/@xmath4 ( top panels ) and 1.6 - 2.0 gev/@xmath4 ( bottom panels ) for unidentified trigger in 2.5 - 4 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "results for 0 - 20% and 20 - 40% au+au collisions are shown in the left panels and right panels , respectively .",
    "the partner baryon yields are scaled to approximately match the partner meson yields .",
    "clearly , the away side shows a concave shape for both partner mesons and baryons .",
    "this is not surprising for partner meson since it dominates the charged hadrons .",
    "but it is interesting to see that partner baryons also have a similar but less concave shape ( higher in the head region and lower in the shoulder region in the figure ) .",
    "fig.[fig : id2 ] shows the ratios of the parter baryon / meson yield as function of partner @xmath0 for several centrality bins at the near side ( left panel ) and away side ( right panel ) .",
    "the ratios are compared with that for the inclusive spectra and @xmath82 collisions .",
    "the ratio for the near and away side jet grow steadily with increasing partner @xmath0 in all centralities , similar to inclusive hadrons and normal jet fragmentation measured in @xmath82 collisions .",
    "but the increase is a little bit stronger in central au+au collisions as well as for the away side .",
    "the @xmath83 ratio is about 0.1 for pure jet fragmentation and @xmath84 for inclusive spectra in central au+au collisions .",
    "the @xmath83 ratio for the away side jet is somewhere in between .",
    "if the mach - cone scenario is true , it is conceivable that the jet excites the medium at the away side , which then fragments in the usual recombination prescription .",
    "this would naturally lead to the centrality dependent baryon / meson ratio in the away side .",
    "fig.[fig : id1 ] shows the near side yield where the trigger is identified in phenix  @xcite(left ) compared with results from star ( right )  @xcite .",
    "phenix results show a steady increase with centrality , except a quick drop of the yield for trigger baryon at @xmath34250 .",
    "the increase trend is qualitatively consistent with results obtained from hadron - hadron correlation ( see fig.[fig : inte ] ) , which was argued to be due to the ridge in @xmath52 .",
    "similar trend is also observed by star in the right panels , except that in their case , the yield for trigger baryon is significantly larger than for trigger mesons and yield for trigger baryon does not drop in central collisions .",
    "however we should note that the trigger @xmath0 in star is different from phenix and they also include more ridge contribution due to a much larger @xmath52 coverage . in any case",
    ", a good theoretical model should be able to simultaneously explain single particle yields , elliptic flow and as well as these pid correlation results .",
    "quark recombination ( thermal - thermal and thermal - shower ) was quite successful in describing the spectra and elliptic flow , but so far was not very successful in describing the jet correlation yield , especially the centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "one of the important systematic errors in the jet correlation comes from elliptic flow background subtraction ( see eq.[eq : core1 ] ) . in the past years",
    ", many different methods have been developed to measure the @xmath85 : reaction - plane ( rp ) method ( @xmath86 ) , 2 particle commulant method ( @xmath87 ) , 4 particle commulant method ( @xmath88 ) , and smd - zdc method ( reaction - plane for direct flow @xmath89 ) .",
    "these measurements have quite different sensitivities on the non - flow effects and eccentricity fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "the obvious question to ask is what @xmath85 one should use in the jet correlation analysis ?",
    "the two particle correlation method and two particle commulant method are closely related .",
    "naturally , all non - flow effects and event by event fluctuations that affects the commulant @xmath85 would also contribute to the two particle azimuthal correlation .",
    "thus it seems that @xmath87 should be used in the background subtraction except that one would like to remove the jet bias to @xmath87 since it is the signal .",
    "phenix use the @xmath86 in all correlation analysis .",
    "the @xmath86 is determined by the bbc which sits in the forward region ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the rp method measures separately the average @xmath85 for the triggers ( @xmath91 ) and partners ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "due to eccentricity fluctuation , the @xmath85 of the triggers and partners fluctuate in the same direction event by event .",
    "this intrinsic fluctuation would leads to @xmath93 .",
    "both phobos  @xcite and star  @xcite found a substantial eccentricity fluctuation , around 40% . from it ,",
    "the additional correction factor can be roughly estimated to be ( assuming a gauss shape for the fluctuation ) : @xmath94 so this suggest that the @xmath86 should be increased by 8% in order to account for the correlated fluctuation between triggers and partners .",
    "however , phenix have measured both the @xmath87 @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "the agreements between the two methods are better than 8% .",
    "note that eq.[eq:8 ] is very sensitive to the @xmath96 used in the calculation and as well as the gauss smearing assumption .",
    "the correction factor would be only 4.5% for a 30% input @xmath85 fluctuation .",
    "so probably the estimation of eq.[eq:8 ] is too simplistic .",
    "in many jet correlation analyses in star , the used @xmath85 is an average between tpc @xmath95 and @xmath88 .",
    "since the @xmath88 reduces non - flow as well as fluctuation effects , it is smaller than @xmath87 .",
    "this probably explains why their away side jet shape at intermediate @xmath0 is less concave comparing to phenix .",
    "one of the advantages of the phenix rp @xmath85 measurement comes from the large pseudo - rapidity gap between bbc and the central arm .",
    "this gap greatly reduce the effects of the jet bias on the rp @xmath85 .",
    "phenix have perform detailed monte carlo simulation to estimate the bias effect .",
    "fig.[fig : v2bias ] shows the centrality dependence of jet induced fake @xmath85 for various pseudo - rapidity window used to determine the rp .",
    "the fake @xmath85 decreases as the @xmath55 window used to determine the rp angle is further away from mid - rapidity . for the @xmath55 window in bbc acceptance ( @xmath90 )",
    ", the fake @xmath85 is almost negligible .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "phenix have measured the jet yield as function of angle with respect to the reaction plane at intermediate @xmath0  @xcite . due to the smearing effect due to relatively poor rp resolution of bbc and possibly a small jet signal ,",
    "we see little jet like difference of the per - trigger yield in the in - plane direction relative to the out - plane direction(see fig.6 of  @xcite and discussions . ) .",
    "we can use this special property to constrain the @xmath85 simultaneously using cfs measured at different angular direction .",
    "fig.[fig : rp]a shows the cfs in 0 - 5% central au+au collisions for 6 angular bins in @xmath97 steps .",
    "fig.[fig : rp]b shows the jet yield after subtracting the flow terms which can be calculated according to simple equation  @xcite . although the cfs change dramatically from in plane to out of plane , the calculated flow term tracks the true flow background nicely .",
    "given the small eccentricity in 0 - 5% , we can safely assume that the jet yield , jet yield should not depend on the trigger direction .",
    "thus the relatively good agreements between 6 measurements is an independent confirmation of the @xmath86 used in the correlation measurement .",
    "the small remaining difference between the jet functions in fig.[fig : rp]b can be used to further constrain the @xmath85 .      in two particle correlation analysis , typically one correlate particles in a high @xmath0 window ( type @xmath20 ) with those in a low @xmath0 window ( type @xmath98 ) .",
    "the distinction between triggers and partners are arbitrary since medium modifications are on the jet pairs .",
    "there is a simple relation between the pty using the high @xmath0 particles as triggers and that using low @xmath0 particles as triggers : @xmath99 where jetpairs@xmath100 and jetpairs@xmath101 represent the average number of jet pairs in one a+a collision and one p+p collision , respectively .",
    "the @xmath102 represents @xmath50 for type a particles and @xmath103 represents pty using type a particles as triggers .",
    "in naive jet quenching picture , the observed triggers are biased close to the surface , the corresponding away side companions have a larger medium to traverse .",
    "one expects @xmath104 or @xmath105 . in direct photon - jet correlation ,",
    "since direct photons are not modified by the medium , the away side jet would behave exactly as the single jet suppression : @xmath106 .    in correlation analysis ,",
    "we are interested in studying the modification of the away side jet tagged by the triggering jet , i.e the * per - jet yield*. in reality we study the modification on the * per - trigger yield * , represented by @xmath45 .",
    "the physics interpretation of this quantity are complicated by the modifications on the triggers . in general",
    "there can be two types of modifications of the triggers :    1 .",
    "additional triggers not coming from jet : such as thermal - thermal recombination , boost of soft particles due to flow .",
    "they tend to dilution the pty .",
    "2 .   pure medium modifications of the triggers : jet quenching , enhancement due to energy dissipation such as radiative gluons / mach - cone / cherekov . they either does not affect or increase the pty .",
    "\\(2 ) represents the effects we hope to study , which are complicated by ( 1 ) .",
    "both can change @xmath45 , but relation eq.[eq : eq1 ] always holds .",
    "fig.[fig : yi ] illustrates th idea by showing the ptys from au+au and p+p , where the two hadrons are selected from non - overlapping @xmath0 ranges . in the left panel , 2 - 3 gev/@xmath4 hadrons and 3 - 4 gev/@xmath4",
    "hadrons are used as triggers ( a ) and partners ( b ) , respectively . in the right panel , the role of triggers and partners are swapped . clearly , the vertical scale of the left panel is less than that in the right panel , simply because there are many more hadrons in 2 - 3 gev/@xmath4 than 3 - 4 gev/@xmath4 . in the left panel ,",
    "the nearside au+au data points are close to those for p+p ; whereas in the right panel , the nearside au+au data are higher .",
    "this is the case because @xmath50 is smaller in 3 - 4 gev/@xmath4 than in 2 - 3 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "more suppression means less number of triggers for fixed number of pairs , thus the pty increase relative to the p+p value .",
    "either ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) can explain this example .",
    "we can argue that most of type - a particles come from recombination without jet correlation , thus @xmath45 for type - a is smaller than that for type - b .",
    "we can also argue that type - a particles come from jet but are less suppressed than type - b , thus @xmath45 for type - b is larger than that for type - a .",
    "@xmath85 and spectra measurements suggest that a large fraction ( more than 50% ) of the particles in 2 - 4 gev/@xmath4 come from recombination",
    ". however the measured per - trigger yield is significantly enhanced at @xmath1074 gev/@xmath4 as shown by fig.[fig : inte ] .",
    "this suggests that either triggers are dominated by the shower - thermal recombination , hence maintaining the jet correlation , or the enhancement of the jet multiplicity is much bigger than the dilution to the triggers .",
    "pid correlation measurement can help to clarify this issue .",
    "fig.[fig : id1 ]  @xcite indeed shows some differences between baryon and meson triggers on the near side and possibly also on the away side .",
    "this trend is not consistent with the dilution from pure thermal - thermal recombination model predictions  @xcite .",
    "further high statistics detailed measurement of the pid correlation in intermediate @xmath0 can help clarify the origin of the enhancement .",
    "at high @xmath0 , the situation is a lot more cleaner .",
    "the dilution to jet yield due to recombination or flow ( if there is any ) become negligible . since each jet fragments into one high @xmath0 trigger ,",
    "the per - trigger - yield at the away side is the same as the per - jet yield .",
    "fig.[fig : scan ] show the centrality dependence of the jet yield for 5 - 10 gev/@xmath4 trigger and 3 - 10 gev/@xmath4 partner in 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "the shape and yield at the near side show very little centrality dependence .",
    "the away side jet is clearly peaked at @xmath6 , but the magnitude is significantly suppressed in central au+au collisions comparing to that in peripheral collisions , consistent with strong quenching or absorption of the away side jet .",
    "phenix also carried out detailed study of the jet correlation analysis in cu+cu collisions at 200 gev .",
    "the jet correlation measurements in cu+cu offer several unique advantages . in terms of @xmath109 , cu+cu collisions cover from peripheral to 30 - 40% central au+au collisions .",
    "@xmath109 can be determined with better precision that in au+au , thus allows a more detailed mapping of the centrality dependence of the onset of the jet quenching . secondly ,",
    "systematic error from @xmath85 on the jet yield is much smaller in cu+cu due to a smaller combinatoric background .",
    "the measurement was carried with 5 - 10 gev/@xmath4 @xmath108 as triggers and charged hadrons in several ranges in 0.4 - 10 gev/@xmath4 as partners .",
    "fig.[fig : cucucf ] show the correlation function in 0 - 20% cu+cu compared with that in p+p .",
    "a clear away side excess can be seen in all partner @xmath0 ranges .",
    "no concave shape is expected even after the @xmath85 background subtraction . at partner @xmath110 gev/@xmath4 ,",
    "the away side can be well fitted with a gauss function .",
    "fig.[fig : cucuwidth ] shows the near side and away side jet width as function of partner @xmath0 for p+p , 0 - 20% and 20 - 40% cu+cu collisions .",
    "no apparent differences can be seen between cu+cu and p+p , suggesting partners come mostly from jet fragmentation in the @xmath0 range under consideration ( all @xmath0 on the near side and @xmath1112 gev/@xmath4 on the away side ) .    comparing the top and the bottom panels of fig.[fig : cucucf ] ,",
    "one notices that there is a larger asymmetry between the near and away side in cu+cu than in p+p . to quantify the medium modifications",
    ", we extract the pty for cu+cu and p+p and construct the @xmath45 as function of @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) . the results from 0 - 20% central cu+cu collisions are shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : xe ] .",
    "@xmath45 at the near side is consistent with 1 in the full @xmath112 range of 0.1 - 1.4 ; the away side @xmath45 starts at slightly above 1 at small @xmath112 , and gradually decreases towards larger @xmath112 , at @xmath114 the suppression value approaches a constant of 0.5 .",
    "this constant behavior is also seen by star in au+au collisions with @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "the level of suppression was found to be similar to single particle @xmath115 .",
    "since the single particle @xmath115 in au+au and cu+cu collisions follows @xmath109 scaling , we can ask whether @xmath45 also has similar scaling behavior .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : xe ] shows the integrated @xmath45 in @xmath116 as function @xmath109 , comparing with the integrated @xmath115 for the single particle . assuming @xmath117 for leading @xmath108s , the original jets should be around 5/0.7=7 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "thus the @xmath45 of the away side should be directly comparable to the single particle at @xmath118 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "in reality , since the @xmath108 @xmath50 is flat at @xmath119 gev/@xmath4 , the exact values of the jet energy for high @xmath0 @xmath120s are not important .",
    "near side @xmath45 is around one in all centralities , consistent with surface emission picture .",
    "away side @xmath45 shows a suppression that has a similar centrality dependence in @xmath109 relative to single particle suppression .",
    "this is rather surprising given that the away side jet travels more medium than the single particles in the naive jet absorption picture . probably suggesting that the simple geometrical bias argument in section[sec : pty ] is too naive . in jet quenching picture",
    ", the suppression is due to the energy degradation of the high @xmath0 jets . the suppression factor @xmath50 depends on both the energy loss itself as well as on the input parton spectra shape . for the single particle ,",
    "the expected @xmath121 scaled p+p spectra have a typical power - law shape with a power of 8 . in the di - hadron correlation , the away side spectra associated with the leading particles have much flatter distribution with a much smaller power .",
    "thus for the same amount of energy loss for single jet and away side jet conditional to the near side jet , the suppression level observed for @xmath45 could be well less than the @xmath50 . if we follow the prescription in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fractional energy loss @xmath122 is related to @xmath50 as : @xmath123 the power `` n '' is @xmath124 for single particle spectra in @xmath125 .",
    "the power for the away side associated spectra can be determined from @xmath11 data  @xcite and it is about 4.8 in @xmath125 .",
    "if the away side jet have same fraction energy loss as single particle , then we would expect : @xmath126 @xmath127 in central au+au collisions would lead to @xmath128 , much bigger than @xmath50 . on the other hand , if we require @xmath129 , then the away hadron energy loss fraction would be @xmath130 , much bigger than the single hadron energy loss fraction @xmath131 , as expected ( about 50% more energy loss ) .",
    "if we apply the same trick to central cu+cu collisions , assuming @xmath132 , the fractional energy loss is would be @xmath133 and @xmath134 for single particle and away side jet , respectively .      in high @xmath0 hadron - hadron or @xmath108-hadron correlation , the total jet energy is not known .",
    "trigger hadron from normal jet fragmentation carries on average about 60 - 70% ( @xmath61 ) of the total jet energy .",
    "this effect is known as the trigger bias , which have been studied in detail in p+p and d+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss of triggering jet in the medium leads to additional bias effects , and since the energy loss is dependent on path length , the trigger bias effects would also coupled with the collision geometry .",
    "thus complicates the extraction of the medium effects .",
    "direct photon ( @xmath136)- hadron correlation does not suffer from such limitations . @xmath136",
    "serves as the gauge of the jet energy and jet direction , allowing the direct study of the medium modification of the away side jets . in reality",
    ", @xmath137 correlation has its own difficulties and limitations .",
    "in particular , once have to deal with large decay @xmath135 background , non - hard - scattering contributions such as the fragmentation and bremsstrahlung and thermal radiation and small rate .",
    "phenix has observed a @xmath0 dependent direct photon excess above the decay background in central au+au collisions . a statistical subtraction method combined with the knowledge on the direct @xmath135 excess  @xcite",
    "is used to obtain the @xmath138 signal .",
    "fig.[fig : gammapp ] show the hadron yield associated with direct photons in @xmath11 collisions for two partner @xmath0 ranges .",
    "near side is consistent with zero , and away side shows some finite excess .",
    "the p+p data are compared with the expected values from the pythia6.1 calculation with @xmath139=2.5 gev/@xmath4 . within the large systematic uncertainties",
    ", the data qualitatively agrees with the pythia value",
    ".    left panel of fig.[fig : gammaauau ]  @xcite shows the comparison of the @xmath44 distribution of the pty in p+p and 0 - 20% central au+au collisions .",
    "the au+au data have smaller systematic errors , however the measurements are currently statistics limited , especially at around @xmath140 region . the au+au data seems to show a small positive yield at @xmath6 , but the significance is only about 1 @xmath141 level .",
    "one can reduce the statistic errors by integrating the away side yield in @xmath142 .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : gammaauau ] show the integrated yield for several trigger @xmath0 regions with partner @xmath0 fixed in 2 - 5 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "p+p data suggest a gradual increase of the pty towards larger trigger @xmath0 , while the au+au data seems to stay relative flat and below the p+p level .",
    "overall , the results of the direct @xmath143 correlation is still in a very qualitative stage , mainly due to limited statistics .",
    "however , the necessary methodologies have been developed and tested by phenix .",
    "it is only a question whether there will be sufficient statistics from future au+au runs .",
    "we might need the rhic - ii in order to do a really jet tomography measurement with direct photons .",
    "phenix have mapped out the landscape of two particle azimuth correlation in heavy ion collisions as function of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , centrality , hadron species , @xmath1 and collision systems in different @xmath44 regions .",
    "the background subtracted `` jet '' pairs seems to come from four different components concentrated in different @xmath44 regions with their characteristic dependence on @xmath0 , pid , @xmath1 etc .",
    "1 ) a hard component around @xmath144 that is consistent with jet fragmentation ; 2 ) a soft and broad component around @xmath144 that is consistent with the `` ridge '' seen by star ; 3 ) a hard component ( `` head '' ) around @xmath5 consistent with fragmentation of away side jet ; and 4 ) a soft component centered at @xmath145 ( `` shoulder '' ) . the hard components are sensitive to the `` quenching '' of the ( di-)jets by the medium .",
    "the hard component at the near side shows little modification , whereas the hard component at the away side are strongly suppressed , up to factor of 5 in central au+au collisions .",
    "the soft components ( `` ridge '' and `` shoulder '' ) represent the response of the medium to the jets , appearing as distortions of the shape and enhancements of the yield .",
    "these components are shown to be important at @xmath146 gev/@xmath4 and have a particle composition that is closer to the bulk medium .",
    "the non - trivial evolutions of the near and away side shape / yield with @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the results of the detailed interplay between the soft and hard components .",
    "the four different components can have very different geometrical bias and trigger bias . in a simple jet absorption picture where a very opaque medium is assumed ,",
    "the near side hard component is emitted from the surface , @xmath147 ; the near side `` ridge '' comes from jet close to the surface , @xmath148 ( @xmath149 is the average radius of the medium ) ; the away side `` shoulder '' results from jet that traverses a large path length , @xmath150 ; the path length for away side hard component can vary dramatically depends whether it is tangential emission or punch - through , @xmath151 .",
    "one of the important future directions of the jet correlation is to quantitatively separate the four different components ; and to study the detailed properties of each components . to fully understand the medium response , one need to address the question that whether the near side `` ridge '' and away side `` shoulder '' are of the same origin or not",
    ". a detailed mapping of the @xmath0 , pid , charge and @xmath1 dependence would be very helpful in this regard .",
    "one can dial the path length by triggering on two high @xmath0 triggers and correlate with the third soft hadrons , the `` displaced '' peak might be seen on both the near and away side  @xcite .",
    "however this is only possible if the high @xmath0 have a significant punch - through component and the medium can not be very opaque . on the jet quenching part , high @xmath0 correlation remains to be a good tomographic tool since it is less affected by the surface bias  @xcite . both the centrality and reaction plane dependence of the jet correlation at high @xmath0",
    "would be very helpful in constraining the transport properties of the medium . in the meanwhile , we should continue to pursue the gamma - jet correlation with increased statistics and refined analysis techniques .",
    "since it is less affected by the geometrical bias and trigger bias , even a statistics limited result could be very powerful in constraining various jet quenching models  @xcite .",
