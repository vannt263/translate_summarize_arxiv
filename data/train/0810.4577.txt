    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are interacting binary stars which emit x - rays as a result of mass transfer and accretion processes .",
    "be x - ray binaries ( bexs ) consist of a rapidly rotating main sequence be star with an equatorial decretion disk , which gives rise to the optical emission lines , orbited by a compact object that is usually a neutron star . the other major class of hmxbs is composed of the supergiant x - ray binaries ( sgxs ) that consist of a more evolved ob star closely orbited by a neutron star ( or in some cases a black hole , like cyg x-1 ) .",
    "sgxs tend to have short ( a few days ) orbital periods while the orbital periods of bexs are considerably longer .",
    "bexs are generally transient x - ray sources with outbursts occurring when the compact star passes periastron @xcite .",
    "all hmxbs are relatively young , rapidly evolving systems in which one component , in most known cases , has already evolved to a supernova and subsequently to the current compact object .",
    "mass redistribution within the system together with mass loss may prevent the supernova , however , and leave a white dwarf as the compact object .",
    "the hmxb @xmath5 cas , for example , is suspected of containing a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "since a significant fraction of all stars form as binary stars , a complete understanding of the evolution of high - mass stars requires an understanding of their evolution in the presence of mass transfer in the interacting binary situation .",
    "the physical properties of many hmxb systems , in particular their orbital period , are known from their x - ray behaviour .",
    "but the orbital periods of many galactic systems ( approximately half of those with known optical counterparts ) remain unknown @xcite .",
    "we have recently initiated a long - term program to obtain time - series optical photometric data for bright hmxbs in an effort to measure periodicities and determine the orbital periods @xcite . here",
    "we report the results of one of our first observing campaigns aimed at rx j0146.9 + 6121/ls i+61@xmath0235 .",
    "the data were obtained by observers associated with the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) in response to our call to observe hmxbs on an on - going basis .",
    "in addition to the photometry , we also made optical spectroscopic radial velocity measurements using the dominion astrophysical observatory s plaskett telescope .",
    "significant photometric and radial velocity variation was found which we report and interpret here .",
    "we further interpret the optical data alongside publicly available x - ray light curves from the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) satellite and previously published information to make an estimate of the orbital period .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "the optical and x - ray observations are described in sect .",

    "three observing seasons of optical photometric data have been obtained of ls i+61@xmath0235 covering the ends of 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .",
    "these data were obtained primarily in the johnson @xmath7 band by the observers listed in table [ tab1 ] , where they are identified by the observer initials assigned to them by the aavso .",
    "the complete @xmath7 band dataset is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where it may be seen that the first two seasons were covered exclusively by huz .",
    "cousins @xmath8 band data are shown in fig .",
    "[ figib - v ] and a limited set of johnson @xmath9 colour observations were obtained by ldj .",
    "other observers joined the hmxb observation program in the third season in response to a general call for hmxb observations @xcite and to aavso alert notices 348 and 354 .",
    "all the photometric observations are available from the aavso international database .",
    "the total numbers of observations are shown in table [ totals ] .",
    "the observations were initially retrieved from the aavso international database and then the observers were individually contacted to resolve discrepancies and errors , if any .",
    "this `` validation '' step is necessary to restore some homogeneity to an otherwise relatively inhomogeneous dataset .",
    "all observers reported an estimate of the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) of each measurement , usually based on a formal estimate of the poisson shot noise .",
    "all of the photometry reported was differential photometry with the magnitudes being determined relative to the comparison stars labelled in fig .",
    "[ figcomps ] .",
    "a variety of methods were used by the observers to reduce the data using aperture photometry and software like maximdl , aip4win or miraap .",
    "none of the data were transformed to the standard johnson / cousins photometric system and therefore are instrumental magnitudes . since our main aim is to determine periodicities from the light curve , instrumental magnitudes are as valuable as properly standardised data provided there are no large unaccounted offsets between the subsets .",
    "the majority of our data were obtained independently by two observers .",
    "the photometric values reported by those two observers , at times of simultaneous observation , show excellent agreement .",

    "that is , the periods 0.34d , 0.67d and 0.10d are present .",
    "such short periods have been argued for other be stars to be due to rotation or non - radial pulsation @xcite .",
    "the 0.67d period is almost surely a subharmonic of the 0.34d period and , if the light variation is caused by a geometrical effect such as ellipsoidal variation ( the z - shape of the folded light curve implies a more complex geometry than simple ellipsoidal variation ) , then the spin period of the be star is 0.68d .",
    "this conclusion can be checked using the astrophysical parameters for ls i+61@xmath0235 previously published by @xcite ( see table [ apv831 ] ) . using the value of 2.9238 c / d ( 0.34d period )",
    "as determined from the analysis of all three observing seasons and a be star radius of 7@xmath111 r@xmath12 we find a surface velocity of 1036 @xmath11148 km s@xmath4 . with a rotation frequency of half that , a surface velocity of 518 @xmath1174 km s@xmath4 results .",
    "the break - up velocity is @xmath13 using @xmath14 m@xmath12 and @xmath15 r@xmath12 , the critical velocity is @xmath16 km s@xmath4 . so the rotation period can not be 0.34d or the star would break - up .",
    "a rotation period of 0.68d is near - critical , a condition that is believed to hold for be stars ( e.g. from statistical studies like that of @xcite , from the direct interferometric measurement of the oblateness of the be star achernar by @xcite and , from theoretical considerations on how the decretion disk is formed like that of @xcite ) .",
    "so it is possible that the rotation period may be 0.68d with the 0.34d period representing when opposite sides of the star are presented to us .    with a rotation period of 0.67d and @xmath17 km s@xmath4 we can use the previously determined value of @xmath18 km s@xmath4 to deduce that the inclination is @xmath19 . taking into account",
    "the error reported for @xmath20 and @xmath21 we have @xmath22 degrees .",
    "next we investigate the possibility that the 0.34d period is the binary orbital period since we have some evidence that the radial velocity period is 0.34d .",
    "the mass function , @xmath23 , with masses @xmath24 , the mass of the be star and @xmath25 , the mass of the compact companion , given in solar masses , the orbital period @xmath26 in days and the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity variation , @xmath27 , given in km s@xmath4 , is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the eccentricity of the orbit @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath30 , @xmath31 m@xmath12 , @xmath32 km s@xmath4 and @xmath33 ( assuming the be spin axis and the orbital axis to be aligned ) in eq .  [ massfn ] gives the mass of the compact companion as @xmath34 m@xmath12 for @xmath35d .",
    "the semi - major axis of the orbit is given by kepler s law as @xmath36 using @xmath34 m@xmath12 and @xmath37d gives @xmath38 r@xmath12 .",
    "since the radius of the be star is 7@xmath111 m@xmath12 , the proposed orbit is clearly too small , so 0.34d can not be the orbital period .",
    "the mass and luminosity of ls i+61@xmath0235 as given in table  [ apv831 ] put it in the middle of the @xmath6 cep instability strip on the hertzsprung - russell diagram @xcite . in a recent catalogue @xcite ,",
    "@xmath6 cep stars are defined to be massive nonsupergiant variable stars with spectral type o or b whose light , radial velocity and/or line profile variations are caused by low - order pressure and gravity mode pulsations . for low order radial modes",
    "the light curve and radial velocity will have the same period .",
    "this is what appears here if we take the radial velocity period to be 0.34d . in that case",
    "the pulsation constant , @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the period and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass and radius of the star in solar units , is 0.03@xmath110.01d , if the astrophysical parameters from table  [ apv831 ] are used .",
    "the modal @xmath39 of known @xmath6 cep variables is 0.033d @xcite which corresponds to the radial fundamental mode .    if",
    ", between the two periods 0.34d and 0.67d , we take 0.34d as the pulsation period , we can not interpret the 0.67d period as a harmonic due to a non - sinusoidal pulsation in time .",
    "thus the interpretation of the 0.67d period as the be star spin period with a spin axis inclination of 23@xmath44 may still hold .",
    "the combination of 0.34d being a harmonic ( or close to a harmonic ) of the 0.67d period plus a pulsation period of 0.34d would make the 0.34d period the prominent one , as observed , since two processes would contributing to the light variation at that period .",
    "a simpler interpretation is that the 0.34 radial velocity period is spurious and the 0.34d photometric period is simply a harmonic of the 0.67d period due to the non - sinusoidal shape of the 0.67d period .",
    "further radial velocity data can resolve this ambiguity .",
    "if the 0.10d period is due to pulsation and 0.34d is the fundamental mode , then it must be a higher order p mode .",
    "finally , we speculate on the origin of the `` super '' x - ray outbursts spaced at approximately 450d . the prograde period of the one - armed density enhancement in the be disk has been measured to be approximately 1240d with some variability @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the compact star also orbits in a prograde direction ( relative to the be star spin ) then we might expect a super outburst to occur when the arm and the compact star line up .",
    "given the arm period of 1240d and an outburst ( alignment ) period of 450d , this means that the compact star s orbital period is 330d in agreement with an expectation of about 300d from the corbet spin - orbit relation @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is roughly consistent with the 184d period found in the _ rxte _ asm data which would be explained by the occurrence of x - ray bursts when the compact star passed through the plane of the decretion disk .",
    "the cause of the apparent 90d intervals between the minor outbursts , if these intervals are significant , is , however , not clear in this interpretation since the minor outbursts would have to occur four times per orbit .",
    "perhaps , if the orbit is sufficiently inclined to the be disk , the mass flow onto the neutron star will switch poles 90@xmath0 in the orbit from the disk crossing nodes and this switch , through some as yet undetermined mechanism , could lead to a minor x - ray outburst .    an orbital period of 330d matches expectations from the corbet spin - orbit relation but is it consistent with the x - ray luminosity of rx j0146.9 + 6121 and typical mass loss rates for be stars ?",
    "based on a distance of 2.5 kpc , @xcite determined that the x - ray luminosity , @xmath45 varies between @xmath46 and @xmath47 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the x - ray lumiosity is related to the mass accretion rate , @xmath48 onto the neutron star through the conversion of gravitational potential energy to luminosity by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gravitational constant and where we may take @xmath51 cm and @xmath52 m@xmath12 to be the radius and mass of the neutron star .",
    "so @xmath48 is between @xmath53 and @xmath54 m@xmath12 yr@xmath4 .",
    "following @xcite we assume that mass leaves the be star at escape velocity and will be captured within a cylindrical region that has an axis through the neutron star in the direction of the relative wind velocity . defining @xmath55 to be the wind velocity at a large distance from the be star and @xmath56 as the wind velocity relative to the neutron star",
    ", we have @xmath57 ( the escape velocity , see eq .  [ vcrit ] for the definition of @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 since the keplerian velocity about the be star at the neutron star distance , @xmath60 , is small relative to @xmath55 .",
    "so the cylindrical capture axis direction would be essentially towards the be star .",
    "the radius of the cylindrical capture region , @xmath61 , is where the kinetic energy of the wind equals the gravitational potential of the neutron star @xcite , @xmath62 the ratio of the emitted wind , @xmath63 , to the captured wind , @xmath48 , mass flow rates is therefore @xmath64 where the binary separation , @xmath60 , is given by eq .",
    "[ asep ] . if @xmath65 then @xmath66 for @xmath67 m@xmath12 , @xmath52 m@xmath12 and an orbital period of 330d , @xmath68 r@xmath12 , and using @xmath69 r@xmath12 in eq .",
    "[ redfrac ] gives a ratio of emitted to captured wind of @xmath70 .",
    "so the inferred be wind rate , @xmath63 , would be between @xmath71 and @xmath72 m@xmath12 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with be mass outflow rates of @xmath7310@xmath74 m@xmath12 yr@xmath4 seen observationally and expected on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "however , we should also note that some observational and theoretical studies have come to the conclusion that the be mass loss rate is much lower at @xmath75 to @xmath76 @xmath77 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 band light curve of ls i+61@xmath0235 shows three strong periodicities at 0.34d , 0.67d and 0.10d . in our interpretation",
    ", the 0.34d period may be from pulsation in the radial fundamental mode , the 0.68d period is the be star spin period and the 0.10d period is a higher order p mode pulsation .",
    "the spin period , when combined with a previous determination of the astrophysical parameters of the be star , gives an inclination for the be spin axis of @xmath22 degrees .",
    "comparing the latest catalogue of @xmath6 cep variables @xcite to the latest catalogue of galactic hmxbs @xcite reveals that ls i+61@xmath0235 would be the first confirmed @xmath6 cep member of a hmxb if subsequent observations uphold these conclusions .",
    "the systemic radial velocity confirms that ls i+61@xmath0235 is a member of the cluster ngc 663 .",
    "if we interpret that the x - ray `` super '' outbursts happen when the compact star lines up with the one - armed be decretion disk enhancement , then the orbital period is approximately 330d .",
    "this orbital period agrees with the value expected from the corbet spin - orbit relation @xcite .",
    "the variability of the @xmath8 light curve looks to be similar to the variability of the @xmath7 band light curve and there may be some variability in @xmath9 colour .",
