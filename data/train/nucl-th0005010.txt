    "lattice qcd calculations predict that nucleons brought to high enough temperature or pressure will make a transition to a state where the quarks are no longer confined into individual hadrons but dissociate into a plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) .    such a qgp can be found in : early universe , dense and hot stars , neutron stars and nucleus - nucleus high energy collisions where heavy - ions are accelerated to relativistic energies and made to collide . after collision ,",
    "a fireball is created , expands , cools , freezes - out into hadrons , photons , leptons that are detected and analysed .    under the hypothesis that qgp",
    "is generated in the early stage of the relativistic collisions , the quantities characterizing the plasma , such as lifetime and damping rate of quasiparticles , are usually calculated within finite temperature perturbative qcd since the interactions among quarks and gluons become weak at small distance or high energy .",
    "however , this is rigorously true only at very high temperature ( even up to five times the critical temperature ) while around the critical temperature ( that corresponds approximately to the energy scale of the sps - cern experiments ) lattice calculations show that there are strong non - perturbative qcd effects and qgp can not be considered as a weakly interacting plasma @xcite .    in order to understand well the relevance of this point , let us consider the color - coulombic qgp parameter , which can be expressed as the ratio of the average potential energy to the average kinetic energy of particles @xcite @xmath0 in perturbative qcd , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the plasma is considered as an ideal gas . at @xmath3 mev , @xmath4 , @xmath5 fm and we get @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , during hadronization , the plasma parameter lies in an intermediate region typical of a non - ideal plasma : collective and individual effects coexist ; memory effects and long - range interactions are present . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not a true strongly coupled plasma ( @xmath7 ) , and a suitable approach describing a system at these intermediate conditions is still non available .",
    "recent progresses in statistical mechanics have shown that the non - extensive statistics , proposed by tsallis @xcite , can be considered as the natural generalization of the extensive boltzmann - gibbs statistics in presence of long - range forces and/or in irreversible processes related to microscopic long - time memory effects .",
    "since these features are present in the early stage of the collisions , we argue that the non - extensive statistics can be more appropriate than the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs one in the context of high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "here we investigate how these statistical effects can affect the equilibrium properties of experimental observables such as the transverse momentum spectrum and the fluctuation - correlation measure of pions emitted during the collisions .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution depends on the phase - space distribution and usually an exponential shape is employed to fit the experimental data .",
    "this shape is obtained by assuming a purely thermal source with a boltzmann distribution .",
    "high energy deviations from the exponential shape are taken into account by introducing a dynamical effect due to collective transverse flow , also called blue - shift .",
    "let us consider a different point of view and argue that the deviation from the boltzmann slope at high @xmath9 can be ascribed to the presence of non - extensive statistical effects in the steady state distribution of the particle gas . in this framework , at the first order in @xmath10 the transverse mass spectrum can be written as @xcite    @xmath11   \\right\\ } \\",
