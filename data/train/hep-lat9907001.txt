    "note that our argument demonstrates that for @xmath38 with @xmath39 , one is left with a gauge field that can not be time independent , even though the resulting action density is  @xcite .",
    "the significance of one constituent carrying a time dependent field lies in the fact that the @xmath1 constituent monopoles form an instanton , and the topological charge can be associated to the so - called taubes - winding  @xcite , described by a time dependent ( gauge ) rotation , going full circle when @xmath40 progresses over one period . for @xmath37 this can be read - off from the explicit expression for the gauge field  @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the constituent located at @xmath33 is the one that carries this taubes - winding , even though its action density is time independent for well - separated constituents .",

    "we show a typical @xmath52 caloron , illustrating that also for @xmath53 the fermion zero - modes are localised on one of the constituents .",

    "when @xmath13 coincides with @xmath21 , the zero - mode is no longer normalisable , which is the origin of the delta function singularities in the nahm transformation .",

    "this is also typically true ( see fig .  1 ) , in particular when well localised , something that may be significant for developing a model for the qcd vacuum that combines monopoles and instantons  @xcite",
