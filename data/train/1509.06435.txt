    "it is the eigenfunction of the one - dimensional laplace operator @xmath13 ( which is simply the second derivative operator , @xmath14 ) , with a dirichlet boundary condition at zero .",
    "note that @xmath13 is the infinitesimal generator of the scaled brownian motion @xmath15 .",
    "brownian motion is a very special process , because it enjoys many useful properties : it is a diffusion process , it is a lvy process ( a process with stationary and independent increments ) , it is also a self - similar process .",
    "the list of other markov processes with an explicit spectral representation of the semigroup is quite short .",
    "we mention here the well - known case of one - dimensional diffusion processes @xcite , branching processes @xcite , a family of symmetric lvy processes obtained as a time change of brownian motion @xcite and the recent work of patie and savov on non - selfadjoint markov semigroups @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to generalize results , and to strictly stable lvy processes ( which we call simply _ stable processes _ ) killed on the first exit from @xmath16 .",
    "this class consists of lvy processes which satisfy the scaling ( or , self - similarity ) property : for any @xmath17 the process @xmath18 ( started from @xmath19 ) has the same distribution as @xmath20 .",
    "such processes exist when the stability parameter @xmath21 belongs to the interval @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath23 we recover the scaled brownian motion and for @xmath24 we obtain a two - parameter family of processes with jumps that we will discuss in detail in the next section .",
    "the scaling property of stable processes is the main reason why they are so popular among researchers and why they appear so frequently in various applications originating in physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "stable processes ( or lvy flights , as they are also known in these fields ) occur in modelling such diverse phenomena as fluctuations and transport in plasma , turbulent diffusions , seismic series and earthquakes , signal processing and financial time series ( see review article @xcite for a comprehensive list of applications ) .",
    "a lvy process is usually defined through _ the characteristic exponent _",
    "@xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the characteristic exponent of a stable process is given by @xmath26 here the parameters @xmath27 belong to the following set of admissible parameters @xmath28 , \\ ; \\rho \\in ( 0,1)\\ } \\cup   \\{\\alpha \\in ( 1,2 ] , \\ ;   1 - 1/\\alpha < \\rho < 1/\\alpha   \\}.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath21 is the same one that appeared in the scaling property discussed above , and it can be shown that @xmath29 , which explains why @xmath30 is called _ the positivity parameter_. everywhere in this paper we denote @xmath31 , and , more generally we will use the `` hat '' notation to refer to any objects obtained from the dual process @xmath32 .",
    "our set of admissible parameters excludes processes with one - sided jumps : subordinators or negative subordinators ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) and the spectrally - negative and spectrally - positive processes ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 or @xmath37 , respectively ) .",
    "the first two cases are not interesting , as the processes have monotone paths and the semigroup of the process on the positive half - line is rather simple , and the case of spectrally - positive / negative processes is covered separately in section [ section_one_sided ] .",
    "let us consider some special cases of stable processes .",
    "when @xmath23 we necessarily have @xmath38 and the process @xmath39 in this case is simply the scaled brownian motion @xmath15 . when @xmath40 we can rewrite the characteristic exponent in the form @xmath41 so that the process @xmath39 can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the cauchy process .",
    "a stable process with @xmath38 is symmetric ( has the same distribution as @xmath44 ) and can be obtained as a subordinated brownian motion .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath45 be an @xmath46-stable subordinator defined by the laplace transform @xmath47=\\exp(-t z^{\\alpha/2})$ ] and independent of the brownian motion @xmath3 , then the process @xmath48 has the same distribution as @xmath49 .    in the general case",
    "( except when @xmath50 ) a stable process is a pure - jump lvy process characterized by the density of the lvy measure @xmath51 , given by @xmath52 where we have denoted @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the lvy measure describes the distribution and the intensity of the jumps of the process , and it is connected to the characteristic exponent via the lvy khintchine formula @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the cutoff function , which is needed to ensure the convergence of the integral . using the cutoff function",
    "@xmath57 when @xmath58 and @xmath59 when @xmath60 one can check that the above integral representation for @xmath61 can be evaluated in closed form as given in .",
    "this construction also works when @xmath40 and @xmath38 ( in this case we can take the cutoff function @xmath62 ) .",
    "a stable process @xmath39 is also a markov process , and its dynamics can be described by _ the infinitesimal generator _ @xmath63 .",
    "this operator is defined for a suitable set of functions @xmath64 as follows @xmath65-u(x)\\big).\\ ] ] as we have mentioned above , when @xmath66 the infinitesimal generator is simply the one - dimensional laplace operator , @xmath67 . in the symmetric case ( that is , when @xmath38 ) the infinitesimal generator is the fractional laplace operator @xmath68 . in the general case , it is a ( non - local ) integro - differential operator having the following form : @xmath69 if we denote by @xmath70 the fourier transform operator @xmath71 then the infinitesimal generator can be represented in a particularly simple form @xmath72 ( see @xcite[proposition 9 ] ) .",
    "in other words , the infinitesimal generator @xmath73 is a pseudo - differential operator @xcite and the characteristic exponent @xmath74 is the symbol of this operator .",
    "consider a stable process @xmath39 started from @xmath75 and denote by @xmath2 the first exit time from @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the transition semigroup of the process @xmath39 killed at time @xmath2 : these operators are defined by , but with @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 . then @xmath78 are sub - markov operators , in particular , they are contraction operators on @xmath10 .",
    "the transition probability density @xmath79 is defined as the integral kernel of the operator @xmath78 : @xmath80 it is known that the transition density exists when @xmath39 is a stable process ( this follows from theorem 3 and example 4 in @xcite ) . from the analytical point of view , killing the process on the first exit from the positive half - line is equivalent to imposing a dirichlet boundary condition on the negative half - line .",
    "thus , in order to find the eigenfunctions of the infinitesimal generator we need to solve the equation @xmath81 for @xmath82 with the `` boundary condition '' @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "the problem of computing @xmath85 ( for a suitable @xmath64 ) is equivalent to solving the following parabolic partial integro - differential equation @xmath86 subject to ( i ) the `` boundary condition '' @xmath87 for @xmath84 and ( ii ) the initial condition @xmath88 .",
    "finally , the transition probability density @xmath89 is simply the fundamental solution to this partial integro - differential equation .    in order to present our results ,",
    "we need to introduce a certain special function @xmath90 , called _ the double sine function _ @xcite .",
    "this function can be defined via two functional equations @xmath91 and the normalizing condition @xmath92 .",
    "we collect several equivalent definitions and various properties of the double sine function in appendix [ appendixa ] , here we only mention the following two facts which will be used most frequently in this paper :    * the function @xmath93 is a real meromorphic function having poles at points @xmath94 ; * for every @xmath95 have the following asymptotic result @xmath96 [ properties_s2_function ] moreover , the above asymptotic result holds uniformly in @xmath97 and @xmath98 on compact subsets of @xmath99 .",
    "now we introduce two functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which will play an important role in this paper . for @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "we define @xmath104 and @xmath105 when it will be needed to stress the dependence on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath30 , we will write @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 . we define @xmath110 and @xmath111 in a similar way , exchanging the roles of @xmath30 and @xmath112 ( so that @xmath113 ) .",
    "note that the integral in converges for @xmath114 ( and thus for all @xmath82 ) : this is easy to establish using .",
    "another important observation is that the function @xmath100 is completely monotone , that is @xmath115 for all @xmath116 and @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we note that the function @xmath101 is bounded on @xmath16 if @xmath117 , and it grows exponentially if @xmath118 ( with a similar result for @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) .",
    "the following theorem is our first main result in this paper : here we generalize formulas and which hold in the brownian motion case .",

    "our next goal is to study the transition semigroup @xmath78 and to establish an analogue of identity . in the case of non - symmetric stable processes",
    "the situation is bound to be more complicated than in the symmetric case , since one of the functions @xmath101 , @xmath119 is exponentially increasing . in order to properly define the operators which diagonalize the transition semigroup , we first need to introduce a suitable space of test functions .",
