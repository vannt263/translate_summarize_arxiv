    "long - range interactions are ubiquitous in nature , the most common examples being gravitation and coulomb interaction . over the last several decades long - ranged systems",
    "have been extensively studied and it is now known that such systems have a very rich , and often intriguing , thermo - statistical behavior ( for reviews on long - range interacting systems see @xcite ) .",
    "these systems exhibit breakdown of ergodicity , suppression of chaos , inequivalence of ensembles , long lived non - gaussian quasi - stationary states , phase transitions in one dimension , negative specific heat , to name a few , and therefore often possess properties that deviate fantastically from `` well behaved '' short - ranged equilibrium systems .",
    "needless to say , even after a lot of effort an in - depth understanding of long - range interacting systems seems to be lacking .    in non - equilibrium",
    "statistical physics , a profusely investigated topic is thermal transport , particularly in low dimensional microscopic models @xcite .",
    "a flurry of research started after it was discovered that many simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) models violate the celebrated fourier s law of heat conduction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the constant of thermal conductivity ( @xmath7 being the system size ) , and the heat current @xmath11 is proportional to the temperature gradient @xmath12 which is assumed to be small .",
    "subsequently a large number of works demonstrated that @xmath3 is actually not a constant independent of @xmath7 but often diverges as @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these models are frequently momentum - conserving systems i.e. , without external pinning potentials ( a notable exception is the coupled rotor model @xcite ) .",
    "one such model is the celebrated fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model that has been studied extensively in the last 50 years in statistical mechanics , chaos theory , nonlinear dynamics and several other contexts @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study thermal transport properties of the fpu model in 1d which has been appropriately modified to include long - range interactions .",
    "transport studies of long - ranged systems are few ( see @xcite for some recent works ) but are extremely important .",
    "for example , studies of thermal rectification @xcite in short - ranged systems show that rectification generally ceases to exist as one approaches the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this raises a question on their applicability in the fabrication of real thermal diodes which are thought to be one of the crucial components of phononics @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied thermal rectification properties of a long - ranged nonlinear lattice model and made an important discovery that rectification is enhanced and also possibly survives even in the thermodynamic limit in the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "thus , besides the purely theoretical interest of understanding the physics of long - ranged interacting systems and low - dimensional thermal transport , these studies also are technologically important .",
    "this is more so since presently it is possible to fabricate actual materials with long - range interactions , such as the coulomb crystal @xcite , the ising pyrochlore magnets @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite and permalloy nanomagnets @xcite with long - range magnetic interactions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the fermi - pasta - ulam model with long - range interactions and the numerical scheme that has been employed to study its transport properties .",
    "we describe the numerical computation of our quantities of interest such as the heat current , conductivity , and temperature profiles . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present the result of our non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ equi ] , the equilibrium ( microcanonical ) version of the model is studied and by computing the largest lyapunov exponent and spatiotemporal excess energy correlation function we explain the thermal transport features of the model under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "we finally summarize our main results in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] and conclude with a discussion .",
    "the oscillators at the lead sites @xmath17 on the left and @xmath18 on the right interact with short - range harmonic potential @xmath19 and connect the long - range part of the lattice to the langevin heat baths at the two ends with temperatures @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the heat current that enters ( exits ) the system through the left ( right ) end is denoted by @xmath22 ( see text).,width=302 ]    we consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath7 anharmonic oscillators , each with mass @xmath23 , displacement @xmath24 and momentum @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) which interact with each other by long - range interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of our long - ranged fermi - pasta - ulam ( lr - fpu ) model is @xcite @xmath27 thus the interaction potential has two parts - the second term on the right in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is the nearest neighbor ( harmonic ) interaction whereas , the third term corresponds to the long - ranged anharmonic interactions .",
    "the strength of the long - range interaction decays as a power - law @xmath28 ( @xmath2 ) with the ( shortest ) distance between the lattice sites @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath4 sets the range of the interaction ; for @xmath31 we have a mean - field scenario where every oscillator interacts with all others with equal strength , whereas for @xmath32 the third term reduces to nearest neighbor anharmonic interactions .",
    "note that the prefactor @xmath33 makes the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) extensive for all values of @xmath4 and is given as @xmath34 for the mean - field ( @xmath31 ) scenario @xmath35 which is the so called kac scaling factor .",
    "thus , inside the shaded ( green ) box in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , every oscillator interacts with all others obeying eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) with interaction strengths depending on the value of @xmath4 .    in order to study thermal transport in this kind of model we do the following alterations , as in ref .",
    "we attach @xmath36 additional oscillators ( we set @xmath37 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : model ] ) to both sides of the one dimensional chain and connect langevin heat baths @xcite at the two ends .",
    "we refer to these oscillator sites , having displacements denoted by @xmath17 at the left and @xmath18 at the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , as the lead sites ( or simply leads ) that connect the main long - ranged system under investigation to the heat baths .",
    "the leads interact with each other and the lr - fpu system _ harmonically _ i.e. , @xmath19 ( spring constant set to unity ) .",
    "the two heat baths are set to unequal temperatures @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( we set @xmath38 always ) which will drive a heat current though the long - ranged system .",
    "the advantage of attaching the lead sites at the two ends is the ease with which one can measure the heat current @xmath11 .",
    "since the interactions @xmath39 in the main long - ranged system is quite complicated , computing the current in the bulk of the system can be cumbersome .",
    "however exploiting the fact that when the system ( including the oscillators at the lead sites ) attains a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) , the current @xmath40 at the @xmath29th site on the lattice is constant and independent of the lattice site index @xmath29 i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , one can measure the steady state current @xmath11 at the lead sites to compute the heat current propagating through the main system .",
    "since the lead site oscillators interact with a simple potential @xmath19 , the current at these sites has a simple expression @xmath42 where @xmath29 is the site index of one of the leads .",
    "the steady state local temperature profile can be computed using the equipartition theorem ( with boltzmann constant @xmath43 ) @xmath44 and assuming that the long - ranged system achieves local thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath45 .",
    "the finite size conductivity @xmath3 for a system of size @xmath7 is computed using the fourier s law @xmath46 to numerically integrate the equations of motion , we employ the second order velocity - verlet algorithm with small time - step @xmath47 . for long - ranged systems ,",
    "a naive force calculation is extremely expensive computationally because of the @xmath48 operations that have to be performed at each time step .",
    "this part can be accelerated by a technique which exploits the convolution theorem and using efficient fast fourier transformations ( see @xcite for implementation algorithms in periodic and open spin systems with dipolar interactions ) .",
    "this drastically reduces the computation time with only @xmath49 operations to perform at each iteration .    starting for random initial conditions ( @xmath24 s",
    "are chosen from a uniform distribution and @xmath25 s from a gaussian distribution , both centered at zero ) we evolve the system by integrating the equations of motion until a ness is attained . thereafter , we compute the heat current @xmath11 , local temperature @xmath45 profiles , and conductivity @xmath3 using eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) , ( [ ti ] ) , and ( [ k ] ) , respectively .",
    "we present our results obtained from the nonequilibrium simulation in the next section .",
    "we choose the langevin heat baths to have temperatures @xmath50 and @xmath51 with small temperature difference @xmath52 between the two ends ; thus the average temperature of the system is @xmath53 . unless mentioned otherwise , we set @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) for our simulations",
    ". we employ free boundary conditions for the oscillators at the ends , although we expect our results to remain practically unchanged even with fixed boundary conditions .",
    "we evolve the system for a large number of iterations ( @xmath58 ) and monitor the heat currents entering the system through the left @xmath59 and leaving the system from the right @xmath60 ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . when a ness is achieved one should obtain @xmath61 in magnitude ; @xmath62 are obtained using eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) . as an additional check for stationarity",
    ", we also computed the velocity distribution of the individual oscillators and obtained a distribution that remains practically unaltered at large times and , as anticipated , fits to a gaussian distribution .",
    "we thereafter compute the heat current as @xmath63 , temperature profile @xmath45 using eq .",
    "[ ti ] ( with @xmath64 ) , and conductivity @xmath3 using eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) , typically for @xmath65 time iterations depending on the value of @xmath7 chosen .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : curr_a ] , we show the thermal conductivity @xmath3 ( @xmath55 is a constant ) of the lr - fpu model as a function of @xmath4 for system sizes @xmath66 it is found that the conductivity @xmath3 exhibits an interesting non - monotonic behavior with @xmath4 . for small values of @xmath67 , @xmath3 increases monotonically , attains a maximum value at @xmath6 and thereafter decreases monotonically .",
    "thus very long - ranged ( @xmath68 ) as well as nearest neighbor ( @xmath32 ) systems have a low thermal conductivity and maximum conductivity is obtained for an optimal @xmath6 .",
    "thus , by tuning the long - range parameter @xmath4 , one can manipulate the conductivity of the system over a wide range ( roughly two orders of magnitude for @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : curr_a ] ) . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : curr_a ] the heat current @xmath70 is shown as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "this is , in some sense , counter - intuitive since the range ( or strength ) of the long - range interaction decreases smoothly with increasing @xmath4 and thus naively one would expect the heat current to decrease monotonically with @xmath4 .",
    "a non - monotonicity at @xmath71 would also have been easy to understand , since for @xmath4 equal to the _ embedding dimension _ , these models go from being a _ true _ long - ranged system to a short ( finite ) ranged system @xcite .",
    "this in many cases , such as in the lr - fpu @xcite , exhibits an unexplained saturation effect , ( see fig .",
    "1a in @xcite , which was also later pointed out in fig .",
    "5(b ) of @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the result in @xcite less reliable for large @xmath7 and small @xmath4 .",
    "also , here we perform our simulations for very different parameter values than what are used in @xcite . ]",
    "quartic lr - fpu @xcite , and lr - xy ( coupled planar rotors ) @xcite models , is marked by a ` transition ' from weak chaos to strong chaos at @xmath71 ( for 1d microcanonical systems ) . instead , in the present case , it is quite intriguing that @xmath6 appears to be a special value having maximum conductivity @xmath3 .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](a ) we present the conductivity @xmath3 as a function of the system size @xmath7 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "we find that for all values of @xmath4 ( computed up to very large values of @xmath72 ) the conductivity @xmath3 shows a power - law divergence @xmath13 at large @xmath7 , as it should for momentum conserving models .",
    "however @xmath73 changes quite drastically ( and nonmonotonically ) with @xmath4 , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](a ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , corresponding to @xmath6 , the conductivity diverges almost linearly ( @xmath74 ) with the system size @xmath7 akin to ballistic heat transport in integrable models e.g. , the coupled harmonic oscillators @xcite .    for @xmath6 , we have checked the @xmath7-divergence of @xmath3 with two other average temperatures @xmath75 ( and same @xmath55 ) and found that the exponent remains practically unaltered as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : kn](b ) . we should mention that the size dependence of @xmath3 for the lr - fpu model seems to be very different from the results for the lr - xy model studied recently @xcite . as an example",
    ", they obtain a thermal insulator i.e. , @xmath76 as @xmath77 for @xmath31 ( fig . 2 in @xcite ) , unlike what we obtain here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] , @xmath73 is shown as a function of @xmath4 and an interesting picture emerges .",
    "we find that the @xmath78 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] can be split into the following regions :    \\(i ) a region of strong long - range interaction for @xmath79 .",
    "this region probably can be further split into two sub - regimes , namely @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 for which @xmath73 shows a decreasing behavior .",
    "a similar suggestion has been put forward in some works @xcite since these two sub - regimes often exhibit different properties .",
    "\\(ii ) an intermediate region of weak long - range interaction for @xmath83 for which the @xmath73 varies quite drastically from @xmath84 .",
    "\\(iii ) a region of short - range ( or finite range but not nearest neighbor ) interactions for @xmath85 where @xmath73 monotonically decreases from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ; the value @xmath87 for large @xmath88 lies well in the range @xmath89 and has been obtained for the nearest neighbor fpu model @xcite in the past .",
    "actually , such a picture has been proposed for both classical @xcite and quantum @xcite long - ranged interacting models ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "however , one needs more detailed simulation in each region to ascertain this accurately .",
    "next , the local temperature profile @xmath45 is shown for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp ] . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the temperature profile is highly nonlinear and becomes less nonlinear as @xmath4 is increased , except for @xmath92 , for which the temperature profile is nearly flat ( in fact , it has a small slope in the @xmath93 sense for reasons unclear to us ) .",
    "the curve marked ` equilibrium ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp ] corresponds to @xmath94 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is to demonstrate that the long - range interacting system equilibrates properly ( @xmath95 ) in absence of external thermal drive at @xmath6 .",
    "evidently , the local slope ( say , around @xmath96 ) of the temperature profile also changes non - monotonically as @xmath4 is varied with a nearly flat profile for @xmath6 , again similar to the coupled harmonic oscillators .    to summarize the results presented in this section",
    ", we find that @xmath6 has a very special behavior which leads to a non - monotonic variation of various quantities such as the conductivity , the slope of the temperature profiles in the bulk of the system , and the divergence exponent @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath6 , our long - range interacting nonlinear system exhibits transport properties similar to an integrable model .",
    "in the next section , we provide additional numerical evidence to demonstrate that the results obtained here are physical and not an artifact of the nonequilibrium setup e.g. , the model of heat baths , boundary conditions , interaction potential of the leads , etc .",
    "in order to understand the results obtained in the previous section , we next study the equilibrium ( microcanonical ) version of the lr - fpu model using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "we remove the baths ( along with the leads ) and close the 1d chain to obtain a periodic lattice where each oscillator interacts with all the others according to eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "the total energy of the system is a conserved quantity now , which is achieved by rescaling the momenta @xmath25 appropriately after they are assigned randomly at @xmath97 .",
    "we choose the energy density @xmath98 which is roughly the same as the average energy of each oscillator at @xmath54 ( the average temperature for which we performed the nonequilibrium simulations ) .",
    "first , we compute the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 as a function of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the numerical computation of @xmath8 here has been performed using the algorithm by benettin _",
    "note that , the larger the value of @xmath8 the greater is the chaoticity of the model and vice - versa . for integrable systems , such as the harmonic oscillators , @xmath99 .",
    "we show the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 as a function of the parameter @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : llexp ] . as can be clearly seen",
    "there is a nonmonotonicity in the behavior of @xmath8 exactly at @xmath6 for which we have obtained nonmonotonic behavior for @xmath3 from nonequilibrium simulations ( fig . [",
    "fig : curr_a ] ) . for fixed @xmath7",
    ", @xmath8 has a minimum at @xmath6 , implying a suppression of chaos .",
    "we speculate that this lack of chaoticity pushes the nonlinear long - ranged system towards an integrable limit which , in turn , is responsible for the nearly ballistic transport features ( @xmath100 and negligible temperature gradient ) at @xmath6 under nonequilibrium conditions . since in ballistic transport the heat carriers propagate with minimum scattering ( least resistance ) , the thermal conductivity is a maximum at @xmath6 , as was obtained in the previous section .",
    "let us extend the connection between @xmath8 and @xmath3 further . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyap_kappa ] , we have shown @xmath101 ( obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : llexp ] ) and @xmath3 ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : curr_a ] ) by shifting and rescaling these two quantities as @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; @xmath104 s are real numbers .",
    "it can be seen that in both the regions @xmath105 and @xmath85 , the two quantities follow each other approximately . thus using the equilibrium results ( @xmath106 ) one can understand the nonequilibrium results ( @xmath107 ) qualitatively and , to an appreciable extent , quantitatively .",
    "another set of numerical experiments can be performed by exploiting the connection between thermal transport and energy diffusion since both essentially describe the same microscopic process .",
    "it is well established that for normal and ballistic heat transport the corresponding energy diffusion should also be normal and ballistic respectively . in recent times a lot of effort has been dedicated to extend such a connection to the regime of anomalous heat transport ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . in the following ,",
    "we study energy diffusion in our equilibrium model by computing the spatiotemporal excess energy correlation function using the relation ( for a microcanonical system ) @xcite @xmath108 where we coarse grain the lattice as @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the number of sites ( oscillators ) in each bin and @xmath112 is the excess energy of the @xmath113 bin ( @xmath114 ) @xcite .    for an equilibrated system , we calculate @xmath115 as a function of @xmath4 for a fixed @xmath90 ( we set @xmath116 ) for different values of time after the system has attained equilibrium . the evolution of @xmath117 at times @xmath118 for different values of @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : espread ] .",
    "note that , quite surprisingly , the speed of propagation is slower for @xmath91 ( @xmath115 is quite localized around @xmath119 ) than for , say , @xmath120 ( for which the long - range model approaches the nearest neighbor fpu model ) .",
    "the spatiotemporal distributions @xmath115 for different times @xmath121 can be collapsed by rescaling the curves as @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 imply sub - diffusion , normal diffusion , super - diffusion and ballistic spreading respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath125 is related to the exponent @xmath0 , governing the temporal variation of the mean square deviation ( msd ) @xmath126 , as @xmath127 .",
    "thus when heat transport is ballistic @xmath128 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : a20](a ) we find that for @xmath129 one obtains an excellent collapse of the rescaled functions @xmath130 shown in the inset for different times @xmath131 .",
    "thus @xmath132 and therefore one should expect a ballistic spread of energy . in fig . [",
    "fig : a20](b ) we exhibit the function @xmath133 that demonstrate that such a scaling ( with @xmath124 ) persists up to the largest times @xmath134 that we have simulated .",
    "we also compute the msd of the excess energy distribution @xcite @xmath135 the variation of msd with time @xmath121 is particularly useful to quantify the speed and identify the nature of energy diffusion .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a20](c ) for the lr - fpu model at @xmath6 .",
    "as can be seen , we obtain @xmath136 with @xmath137 indicating ballistic propagation .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that the ballistic - like heat transport ( marked by the nearly linear divergence of the conductivity with system size @xmath7 ) as was seen in fig . [",
    "fig : kn ] for @xmath6 is a physical property of our model . for other values of @xmath4",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : espread ] , we estimate that @xmath125 is in the range @xmath138 , thus implying super - diffusion and therefore violation of fourier s law in nonequilibrium , as we expect from fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](a ) .",
    "one can also compute the exponents @xmath0 and relate it to the @xmath73 using the so called _ connection relations _ @xcite to verify if they hold .",
    "a recent study however argued that such a connection between thermal transport and energy diffusion may not exist in general for anomalous transport @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied thermal transport properties of the fermi - past - ulam model in the presence of long - ranged interactions that decay with ( shortest ) distance between the lattice sites as a power - law @xmath28 . by attaching two langevin heat baths at the two ends of the open chain",
    "we compute the heat current , conductivity , and the temperature profiles of the long - ranged fpu system for different values of the exponent @xmath2 using large - scale nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we find that @xmath3 exhibits an interesting non - monotonic @xmath4 dependence with a maximum at @xmath6 . from the system size dependence of @xmath3",
    ", we obtain a power - law divergence @xmath13 , where @xmath139 , for all values of @xmath4 ( violation of fourier s law ) ; for @xmath6 we obtain @xmath86 and the temperature profile has a negligible ( wrong ) slope .    in order to explain these results , we next look into the equilibrium dynamics of the long - ranged model ( by removing the heat baths ) .",
    "we compute the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 as a function of @xmath4 and obtain a nonmonotonic dependence that enabled us to understand the @xmath4 variation of the conductivity @xmath3 , both qualitatively and , to some extent , quantitatively",
    ". the near ballistic divergence of @xmath3 at @xmath6 is explained by the suppression of chaos for the same @xmath4 value in the equilibrium simulations .",
    "thus , although the range of interaction changes monotonically with the long - range parameter @xmath4 , it is intriguing to see non - monotonicity in all the quantities we have computed namely , @xmath3 , @xmath73 , and @xmath8 .    from the computation of the spatiotemporal excess energy correlation function , we confirmed the almost linear divergence of @xmath3 for @xmath6 , which corresponds to a ballistic energy diffusion in the equilibrium model .",
    "thus for @xmath6 , from both the nonequilibrium and equilibrium simulations , we find that the nonlinear long - ranged interacting fpu model behaves similar to a _ nearly integrable system _ @xcite .",
    "this is quite exciting , since integrable nonlinear long - ranged models are not encountered very frequently ( one such example is the many - body calogero - moser system @xcite which is nonlinear , long - ranged , and exactly integrable ) and therefore this needs to be explored further . at this point , it is also quite tempting to recall the connection between the fermi - pasta - ulam model and the nonlinear yet integrable toda model @xcite , both with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "note that we can not completely rule out finite size effects in the results presented here which therefore may change as @xmath7 is increased further ( for larger @xmath140 , performing numerical calculations become computationally impractical ) .",
    "finite size effects have plagued several works even for the short - ranged fpu model in the past and in recent times @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the results reported here , besides their academic interest , will also be important from the experimental perspective where one deals with finite sized systems at finite temperatures .",
    "there are a number of possible open questions that we believe are important for this model ( or similar models ) but have not been addressed in this paper .",
    "this includes analyzing the temperature dependences of conductivity , the generality of these results by studying other classes of interaction potentials , the presence of disorder and on - site potentials , the existence of discrete breathers that often affect heat transport @xcite , extension to higher dimensions etc .",
    "we plan to address these issues in the future .",
    "of course any analytical result along these lines will be extremely desirable to obtain .",
    "we hope that the results presented here will encourage further investigations of the heat transport properties of long - range interacting systems in the future .",

    "<S> we study the thermal transport properties of the one dimensional fermi - pasta - ulam model ( @xmath0-type ) with long - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the long - range interaction decreases with the ( shortest ) distance between the lattice sites as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> two langevin heat baths at unequal temperatures are connected to the ends of the one dimensional lattice via short - range harmonic interactions that drive the system away from thermal equilibrium . in the nonequilibrium steady state </S>",
    "<S> the heat current , thermal conductivity and temperature profiles are computed by solving the equations of motion numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the conductivity @xmath3 has an interesting non - monotonic dependence with @xmath4 with a maximum at @xmath5 for this model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at @xmath6 , @xmath3 diverges almost linearly with system size @xmath7 and the temperature profile has a negligible slope , as one expects in ballistic transport for an integrable system . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the non - monotonic behavior of the conductivity and the nearly ballistic thermal transport at @xmath6 obtained under nonequilibrium conditions can be explained consistently by studying the variation of largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 with @xmath4 , and excess energy diffusion in the equilibrium microcanonical system . </S>"
