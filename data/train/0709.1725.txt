    "in recent years , financial markets have been studied using statistical physics approaches @xcite and some stylized facts have been observed including ( i ) the probability density function ( pdf ) of the logarithmic stock price changes ( log - returns ) has a power - law tail @xcite , ( ii ) the absolute value of log - returns are long - term power - law correlated @xcite .",
