    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite has generated high interest in consistent long - distance modification of gravity .",
    "although gravity might be modified so as to account for cosmic acceleration , modification must be suppressed at short distances because general relativity is confirmed to very high accuracy in the solar system .",
    "thus , for a modified theory of gravity to be consistent , it is important to equip a mechanism to screen the effect of modification that could otherwise persist down to small scales . a wide class of modified gravity theories can be ( at least effectively ) described in terms of a scalar - tensor theory , and the screening mechanisms can be understood by inspecting the structure of the scalar - tensor lagrangian .",
    "mainly two mechanisms have been proposed so far .",
    "one is the chameleon mechanism  @xcite , in which a density - dependent effective potential is introduced to make the scalar field sufficiently massive in a high - density environment .",
    "this mechanism is utilized for example in @xmath0 gravity  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism is known as the vainshtein effect@xcite , which operates in models with nonlinear derivative interactions . in such models",
    ", nonlinearity becomes large in the vicinity of a matter source to suppress the scalar - mediated force .",
    "this mechanism is incorporated for example into the dgp model  @xcite , the galileon model  @xcite , and massive gravity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how the vainshtein effect works in horndeski s scalar - tensor theory  @xcite .",
    "horndeski s theory is the most general theory composed of a single scalar field and a metric that gives rise to second - order field equations , and therefore includes a large number of concrete models of modified gravity as specific cases .",
    "we present an algebraic master equation that determines a gravitational field around any static and spherically symmetric distribution of nonrelativistic matter .",
    "the similar problem of deriving the vainshtein solution in the cosmological background was addressed in ref .",
    "there , however , complete analysis was hindered by the complexity of the governing equations . in the case",
    "where the effect of the cosmic expansion may be ignored , the relevant equations are simplified so that the problem actually reduces to what has been done in the context of the galileon model  @xcite and massive gravity  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible to determine completely the conditions under which the vainshtein solutions are available .",
    "our solution thus obtained is useful in testing modified gravity . among various cosmological observations , we are particularly interested in cluster lensing , which can provide the convergence over a wide range of radii by combining strong- and weak - lensing measurements ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the precise measurement of the structure of galaxy clusters offers us an important clue to test modified theories of gravity  @xcite .",
    "the first paper on gravitational lensing in the context of massive gravity is ref .",
    "the gravitational sector considered there is given by a subclass of horndeski s theory",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite considered nonminimal and disformal coupling to matter , while we assume that matter is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "working in horndeski s theory , one can examine modified gravity endowed with the vainshtein screening mechanism in a generic manner . in this paper",
    ", we compute the lensing convergence of galaxy clusters in horndeski s theory based on the general spherically symmetric solution . as a specific example",
    ", we demonstrate how nonlinear massive gravity proposed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite is included in our analysis , and explore the possibility of detecting the signatures of modified gravity in the context of massive gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we define horndeski s lagrangian and explain our procedure to obtain static and spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : eq ]",
    ", we derive the vainshtein solution and present the conditions for the existence of the solution .",
    "we show the relation between horndeski s theory and the decoupling limit of massive gravity in sec .",
    "[ sec : proxy ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lens ] we study the effect of modification of gravity on gravitational lensing and explore its implications for cluster lensing observations . section  [ sec : concl ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider the most general scalar - tensor theory constructed by horndeski .",
    "the action we study is given by @xmath1 + s_{\\rm m}\\left[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi_{\\rm m}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the action for matter @xmath3 , which is assumed to be minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the first term is composed of the four lagrangians , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , \\\\ { \\cal l}_5&= & g_5(\\phi , x)g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu\\phi -\\frac{1}{6}g_{5x}\\bigl[(\\box\\phi)^3 \\nonumber\\\\&&\\quad -3\\box\\phi(\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu\\phi)^2 + 2(\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu\\phi)^3\\bigr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 . the second term is the action for matter fields . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the ricci scalar , @xmath8 is the einstein tensor , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "we have written the lagrangians in the equivalent form called the generalized galileon rather than the original one . in this paper , we use notation such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in spherical overdensities on subhorizon scales , so that we will neglect the effect of cosmic expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vainshtein mechanism in horndeski s theory has been investigated taking into account the background evolution of the scalar field , @xmath15 , and it was shown that newton s `` constant '' evolves in time through its dependence on @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar argument )",
    ". however , the time variation of newton s `` constant '' is strongly constrained from experiments  @xcite .",
    "this leads us to assume that the scalar field has a negligible time dependence at least during the relevant period , @xmath18 const and @xmath19 .    our background solution is thus taken to be @xmath20 in order for the theory to admit this solution , we require that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "spherically symmetric perturbations produced by a nonrelativistic matter lump on top of the background  ( [ bg ] ) can be written as @xmath23{{\\rm d}}t^2+[1 - 2\\psi(r)]\\delta_{ij}{{\\rm d}}x^i{{\\rm d}}x^j , \\\\",

    "one sees that eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and  ( [ f3 ] ) can be integrated once to give algebraic equations for @xmath32 . in doing",
    "so it is convenient to use the enclosed mass defined as @xmath33 the resultant equations coincide with those derived from taking the limit @xmath34 const and @xmath30 in the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us introduce six dimensionless parameters , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , as well as the planck mass @xmath37 and a new mass scale @xmath38 , to rearrange and simplify the expressions .",
    "those dimensionless quantities are related to the coefficients in the above equations as @xmath39 and @xmath40 we also define @xmath41 both of which are dimensionless .",
    "now the gravitational field equations  ( [ f1 ] ) and  ( [ f2 ] ) reduce to @xmath42 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ psi - eq ] ) and ( [ phi - eq ] ) to the scalar - field equation of motion  ( [ f3 ] ) , we arrive at    @xmath43x^2 + \\left(\\nu+2\\alpha^2 + 4\\beta\\xi\\right)x^3 - 3\\beta^2x^5=0.\\label{basic - equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving the algebraic equation @xmath44 for @xmath45 , one obtains the radial profile of @xmath45 in terms of @xmath46 .",
    "it is then straightforward to determine the two metric potentials by using eqs .",
    "( [ phi - eq ] ) and  ( [ psi - eq ] ) .",
    "note in passing that if @xmath47 then we have a trivial solution @xmath48 which is not interesting . in the rest of the paper",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath49 .",
    "since there is a sufficient number of parameters , at this stage the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath50 are free in principle .",
    "however , it is important to note that the structure of @xmath50 in the most general case is still essentially the same as the corresponding equation in massive gravity : it is quintic and the matter source term @xmath51 appears only in the zeroth - order and quadratic terms .",
    "this structure allows us to proceed following closely the previous analysis in massive gravity  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we solve the equation @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and single out a solution appropriate for our current purpose in each domain .",
    "we then derive the conditions under which the two solutions are matched smoothly in an intermediate region .",
    "the procedure here is basically the same as that of ref .",
    "the region far from the source corresponds to @xmath54 , while it is assumed that @xmath53 in the vicinity of the source , where the vainshtein mechanism is expected to operate .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to define the vainshtein radius @xmath55 by @xmath56    in the outer region ( @xmath54 ) , there is always a decaying solution , @xmath57 which is obtained by neglecting the nonlinear terms in @xmath50 .",
    "we are interested only in this solution , because the other solutions , if they exist , do not correspond to an asymptotically flat spacetime .    the stability of the solution in the linear regime can be studied by using the truncated action @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] working in this action , one can derive the stability condition easily in the same way as in the brans - dicke theory : _ in the einstein frame _ , the kinetic term for small fluctuations has the right sign provided that @xmath59 we require the condition  ( [ stability - linear ] ) for the stability of the solution @xmath60 .",
    "the same condition can also be derived from @xmath61 .",
    "( see appendix  a for further details . )",
    "let us turn to identifying the desired inner solution .",
    "the inner solution is different depending on whether @xmath62 or @xmath63 , because the structure of @xmath50 for @xmath53 is crucially different .      in the inner region ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "( [ basic - equation ] ) reduces to @xmath64 the behavior of the solution to this equation depends on the sign of @xmath65 .",
    "+ ( i ) @xmath66 . in this case , the second and the third terms in eq .",
    "( [ large - a ] ) balance , so that the solution is @xmath67 for this inner solution we find @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is not at all standard gravity .",
    "we therefore discard this possibility .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath70 . in this case",
    ", we have the same solution as above , @xmath71 , which is to be discarded for the same reason .",
    "we have another solution , @xmath72 for which the first and the second terms in eq .",
    "( [ large - a ] ) balance . for this latter solution",
    "we have the correct newtonian behavior : @xmath73 .",
    "this is therefore the vainshtein solution we are looking for .",
    "+ having thus identified the desired solutions in the inner and outer regions , we consider the matching of the two . for simplicity",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath74 .",
    "the solution matching in the case of @xmath75 can also be done essentially in the same way as follows .    for @xmath74 ( and hence @xmath76 )",
    ", the outer solution @xmath77 can be matched only to the inner solution @xmath78 smoothly .",
    ", the solution @xmath79 is stable , but the other one , @xmath80 , is not . ]",
    "the smooth matching of the two solution is possible if and only if _ @xmath44 has a single root in @xmath81 for any @xmath82 .",
    "_ since @xmath83 , if @xmath84 the intermediate value theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root in @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath85 does not in fact depend on @xmath51 . using the intermediate value theorem again in @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ", it can be shown that one or three roots exist in general in @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 and @xmath90 be the solution to @xmath91 if such @xmath92 and @xmath93 do not exist , it is obvious that there is only a single root in @xmath81 . in this case , the smooth matching is possible .",
    "if such @xmath89 and @xmath90 exist , @xmath44 would in general have three roots in @xmath81 for some interval of @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath44 for @xmath53 [ eq .  ( [ large - a ] ) ] has a single root in @xmath81 , two of the three roots in @xmath94 disappear as @xmath51 increases . for parameters satisfying @xmath95 , the solution corresponding to @xmath96 disappears as @xmath51 increases , implying that the smooth matching is impossible in this case . however , if @xmath97 the solution corresponding to @xmath96 remains and hence the smooth matching is still possible .",
    "indeed , there is a single root for any @xmath82 in this case because a simple manipulation shows that @xmath98 increases with increasing @xmath51 , where @xmath99 is the locus of extrema in @xmath81 .    summarizing , the outer and inner solutions can be matched smoothly provided that eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) and either of the following two conditions are satisfied : ( i ) @xmath92 and @xmath93 do not exist satisfying eq .",
    "( [ exist2 ] ) ; ( ii ) such @xmath92 and @xmath93 exist , but they satisfy eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) .      here",
    "again we focus on the case of @xmath74 for simplicity .",
    "the problem reduces to solving the cubic equation , @xmath44 , where now @xmath100 the inner solution is @xmath101 ( we assume that @xmath102 . )",
    "this solution shows the correct newtonian behavior : @xmath73 .",
    "the inner and outer solutions can be matched smoothly only for @xmath103 , which is also required from stability of the inner solution .",
    "smooth matching also requires that there is a single root in @xmath104 for any @xmath82 , or , equivalently , that @xmath50 has no local extrema in @xmath104 .",
    "the two local extrema are in @xmath105 provided that @xmath106 where we used the condition  ( [ stability - linear ] ) .",
    "otherwise , one must require that the discriminant of @xmath107 is negative , _ i.e. , _ @xmath108 summarizing , smooth matching is possible if eq .",
    "( [ c3 - 1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ c3 - 2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let us confirm that the conditions for smooth matching indeed reproduce the previous result obtained in the context of massive gravity  @xcite .",
    "to do so , we start with finding out the concrete form of @xmath109 corresponding to the decoupling limit of massive gravity . the correspondence can be seen more clearly if we move to the covariantized version of the decoupling limit lagrangian , _",
    "i.e. , _ the `` proxy theory '' proposed in ref .",

    "@xcite claimed that cold dark matter halos can be more properly described by the einasto profile than by the nfw profile .",

    "<S> we explore the possibility of testing modified gravity exhibiting the vainshtein mechanism against observations of cluster lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we work in the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations ( horndeski s theory ) , and derive static and spherically symmetric solutions , for which the scalar field is screened below a certain radius . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the essential structure of the problem in the most general case can be captured by the program of classifying vainshtein solutions out of different solutions to a quintic equation , as has been performed in the context of massive gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the key effect on gravitational lensing is that the second derivative of the scalar field can substantially be large at the transition from screened to unscreened regions , leaving a dip in the convergence . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to put observational constraints on parameters characterizing the general scalar - tensor modification of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how this occurs in massive gravity as an example , and discuss its observational signatures in cluster lensing . </S>"
