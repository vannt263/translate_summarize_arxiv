    "metal - ammonia solutions ( mas ) are an example of quantum - classical systems whose thermodynamic , dielectric , and optical properties are controlled by electron - electron interactions . in our recent papers @xcite we have explained that these interactions are mainly due to the dispersion attractions between solvated electrons at metal concentrations in the range of 1 - 5 mpm.@xcite these attractions result in two main effects : a phase separation in solutions of light alkali metals below a critical temperature , and a dielectric instability of the solution , which may be considered as the onset of metallization .",
    "considering the role of the induced dipolar interactions between solvated electrons , we have restricted ourselves to the nonmetallic phase .",
    "@xcite we have already given an indication @xcite that the metal - nonmetallic ( mnm ) transition , or insulator - to - metal transition ( imt ) , are likely driven by a goldhammer - herzfeld ( gh ) mechanism , @xcite i.e. a polarization catastrophe which has its origin in the dispersion interactions .",
    "we have also indicated that the correlation effects @xcite and the solvent polarizability @xcite may be responsible for the unusual properties of the metallic phase and lead to its instability at metal concentrations lower than 5 mpm . as explained in ref.@xcite",
    ", this seems to forbid the mott - like scenario for the mnm transition in mas .",
    "that point reactivates the old debates of mott,@xcite jortner , and cohen @xcite on the nature of the mnm transition .",
    "mott assumed the phase separation to be a consequence of the mott - like transition , which is hidden by the phase separation below the consolute temperature ( @xmath6 ) , and the mnm transition above the temperature ( @xmath7 ) should be of the anderson type due to disorder . on the contrary , jortner and cohen @xcite described the system above the consolute point as a microscopically inhomogeneous regime in which the concentration fluctuates locally one of the other well - defined values @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and the mnm mechanism does not involve the mott transition . according to them , the concentration @xmath11 mpm corresponds to the nonmetallic blue phase ( consisting of solvated electrons as described in ref.@xcite ) , whereas the concentration @xmath12 mpm corresponds to the bronze metallic phase in which electrons are delocalized and move freely .",
    "using this hypothesis and a semi - classical theory of percolation , jortner and cohen were able to account for most transport properties observed in the intermediate concentration regime above the consolute temperature .",
    "@xcite however , in the conclusive part of their paper,@xcite they pointed out the four important unsolved questions : 1 ) what is the origin of this microscopically inhomogeneous state? ; 2 ) what is the origin of the phase separation? ; 3 ) is there any link between the two phenomena ? ; and finally 4 ) what is the nature of the mnm transition?. we have already partly answered the last question in our previous papers @xcite , and we now think that we are able to answer the three other ones , at least at a qualitative level at this stage of our theory .",
    "this will be the subject of the discussion of the present paper , but we are mainly facing a new theoretical situation .",
    "our results show that at low temperatures an intermediate concentration range exists in which both states , i.e. , the nonmetallic one ( the blue phase ) and the metallic one ( the bronze phase ) , are intrinsically unstable .",
    "@xcite such a theoretical possibility has been already suggested by one of us @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss in this paper , we believe that this is at the origin of the phase separation , and that the existence of an inhomogeneous state above the consolute temperature should additionally be clarified",
    ".    there are numerous experimental data on the electronic @xcite and structural @xcite properties of the metallic state of mas , but a theoretical treatment of concentrated mas is restricted to a few papers only .",
    "@xcite the difficulty of such a treatment is twofold : first , the electron density in the metallic phase is still rather low so that strong electronic correlation effects occur , and , secondly , the molecular nature of the solvent as well as a the sufficient role of the solvent polarizability complicate the theoretical study of these correlations in the metallic phase .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop a statistical model treating the excess electrons in mas under conditions corresponding to the metallic phase .",
    "this phase represents a three - component mixture consisting of delocalized electrons , cations , and polarizable solvent molecules . in general",
    ", a detailed information about electronic and thermodynamic properties of the system may be obtained by quantum molecular simulations based on the car - parrinello method .",
    "@xcite however , the computational costs and sensitivity of such calculations to the choice of the interaction potentials ( an explicit account of cations , polarizability of solvent and so on ) restrict the application of the method and can not be used efficiently for a complete understanding of the phase behavior of mas . an alternative way",
    "may be an employment of the integral equations theory based on quantum hypernetted chain closure @xcite , but the current status of such an approach is limited only to simple metals @xcite or electrons localized in polar liquids @xcite and ionic liquids.@xcite indeed , we do not know any applications extended to molecular metallic fluids . in order to avoid the complexity related to numerical implementations , we consider in the present paper that the metallic phase is well described by an effective two - component plasma ( tcp ) , where the role of the solvent is restricted to its screening effects .",
    "we take into account different frequency scales of this screening as we have done for the nonmetallic phase , @xcite i.e. that the screening of electron - electron interactions is due to the electronic polarizability of solvent , whereas ion - ion interactions are additionally screened by the permanent dipoles of the solvent molecules . as a result ,",
    "we use different dielectric constants to treat the coulomb interactions properly , i.e. a high - frequency dielectric constant for the electron - electron interactions and a low - frequency dielectric constant for ion - ion interactions respectively . by using available analytical expressions for the free - energy of the tcp @xcite",
    ", we will derive the main thermodynamic and dielectric characteristics of the metallic phase , its pressure and chemical potential , and we will evaluate the locus of the critical lines ( spinodal and coexistence line ) which correspond to the instability of the metallic phase .",
    "then , by comparing the thermodynamic behavior of the metallic phase with that of the nonmetallic phase,@xcite we will give evidence that an inhomogeneous electronic microstructure must arise at intermediate metal concentrations in mas . although the detailed study of the inhomogeneous microstructure will be the subject of our next paper , @xcite we will assert in this work that the thermodynamic and dielectric peculiarities of the inhomogeneous electronic state govern the behavior of mas in this concentration range . eventually , by treating the inhomogeneous microstructure within the methods of simple liquids , we will propose a macroscopic criterion for the mnm transition , and sketch the complete phase diagram of mas .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .",
    "the high - density phases of mas are composed of delocalized interacting electrons scattered by ammonia molecules and solvated ions .",
    "as explained above , the solvent molecules are considered to result in the screening of the ions and the electrons only .",
    "the ion - ion interactions will be screened by the low frequency dielectric constant @xmath13 , while the electron - electron interactions will be screened only by the high frequency dielectric constant @xmath14 .",
    "next we treat the system as a tcp , the first component being the interacting electron gas in a jellium , and the second component being a classical plasma of ions in a jellium of electrons .",
    "finally , we add an interaction term which represents a correction to the madelung energy of the point ions in the jellium of electrons , i.e. a pseudo - potential correction due to the short - range scattering of the free electrons by valence core electrons of the ions .",
    "notice that these ions are themselves solvated by ammonia molecules .",
    "this defines two different effective radii for the ions .",
    "the first one is an effective classical radius of the solvated ions , that we call @xmath15 , which will be used to account for the classical short - range ion - ion interactions through the use of a packing factor .",
    "the second effective radius concerns the electron - ion interactions and it is related to the core ion radius , and we call it @xmath16 .",
    "it includes the effect of the solvation shell of a particular ion . for alkali metals such as na ,",
    "k , rb , cs , the effective core radii are only slightly different from those determined by the pseudo - potential method @xcite for non solvated ions .",
    "however , the case of li@xmath17 is special , since it is well established @xcite that owing to their small size , the li@xmath17 ions occupy tetrahedral vacancies formed exactly by four ammonia molecules . from this point of view",
    ", li@xmath17 ions are strongly bound to form complexes li(nh@xmath3)@xmath18 , which are dominant ionic species in the solution .",
    "consequently the core radius of solvated li@xmath17 is substantially larger than in the case of liquid li metal .",
    "thus , our model contains four parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath19 , in addition to the wigner - seitz parameter @xmath20 , related to the metal density ( or the density of electrons , since the alkali metals are monovalent ) .",
    "finally , the excess free energy per electron of the metallic phase is written as the sum of three terms : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the free energy per electron of an interacting electron gas with density @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is that of a classical one - component plasma ( ocp ) of ions in a jellium of electrons . finally , the last term @xmath25 represents the electron - ion interactions and will be treated in the framework of the pseudo - potential theory @xcite .",
    "notice that ashcroft proposed a similar approach to the metallic phase,@xcite except that he did nt used the different dielectric constants in his model .",
    "the electron gas may be parameterized by two dimensionless parameters @xcite : the electron coupling constant @xmath26 , and the reduced temperature @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the inverse temperature . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the electron mass and charge , respectively",
    ". however one can easily check that @xmath31 and @xmath32 under conditions corresponding to the metallic phase in mas , and therefore the electron gas is degenerate and we can treat it at @xmath33 .",
    "its free energy may be parameterized by the single parameter , i.e. the effective wigner - seitz radius defined as @xmath34 . applying the conventional methods for the electron gas",
    ", we have : @xmath35 the first two terms are obtained by the usual hartee - fock approximation , and the last term is the correlation energy ( beyond the hartree - fock approximation ) . in order to treat this correlation energy @xmath36 , which is a smooth function of @xmath37 ,",
    "we have employed the result of the local density approximation parameterized in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting quantum simulations : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are numerical parameters obtained from ref . @xcite . as we noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the degenerate electron gas gives the main contribution to the total excess free energy @xmath42 of the metallic phase .",
    "the mean distance between ions exceeds 9   at metal concentrations of about @xmath43 mpm , so short - range details of the ion - ion interactions can be ignored , and we may treat the ions as charged hard - spheres in the uniform jellium background .",
    "thus , the excess free energy of ions is controlled by the two dimensionless parameters : the dimensionless ion coupling constant @xmath44 , and the packing factor @xmath45 in which @xmath46 is the classical hard - sphere ion diameter .",
    "simple evaluations show that the first parameter is of about 10 in the metallic na - nh@xmath3 , and that the second one does not exceed 0.05 under the same conditions .",
    "therefore the free energy @xmath47 per ion may be written as @xmath48+f_{hs}(\\eta)+f_{c}(\\gamma_i ) , \\label{ocp1}\\ ] ] where the first term is the ideal contribution , @xmath49 is the de broglie length and @xmath50 is the ion mass .",
    "the second term in ( [ ocp1 ] ) is the hard - sphere contribution , and the last term is the contribution due to coulomb interaction between ions .",
    "analytical expressions for these contributions are well - known .",
    "the hard - sphere part is expressed as @xcite : @xmath51 according to ref.@xcite , in which simulation data were fitted for various @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 , the electrostatic contribution can be approximately written as : @xmath54 the first term in this expression represents the madelung energy and gives the most important contribution .",
    "the remaining terms are temperature - dependent corrections due to thermal motion of the ions .",
    "the main difficulty is to evaluate @xmath25 , because the bare ion - electron interaction is modified in the solution by the polarizability of the solvent .",
    "moreover , the madelung term in eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) concerns the point ions .",
    "the correction to this approximation is well treated by the pseudo - potential model for simple metals @xcite . in that point",
    "we follow the ashcroft approach @xcite and adapt the pseudo - potential model @xcite to our case . as a result , we write the electron - ion contribution ( expressed in effective atomic units @xmath55 ) as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and the ion - core parameter @xmath16 is related to the atomic number of the ion as discussed above . notice that in our previous paper , @xcite we took a slightly different notation and wrote @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 to make the exact link with the present paper .",
    "once we know the expression of the excess free energy @xmath60 per electron , we can deduce the excess pressure @xmath61 , the excess chemical potential @xmath62 , and the excess compressibility @xmath63 as determined by the usual formulas : @xmath64 as discussed above , it may be checked that the degenerate electron gas ( deg ) gives the main contribution to @xmath65 at low temperatures , whereas the ionic contribution is only a correction .",
    "our tcp model of the metallic phase of mas depends on temperature and metal concentration and can be characterized by the four parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath66 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "as we will see , the value of the ionic mass @xmath50 in ( [ ocp1 ] ) does not change the values of the density at which the metallic state becomes unstable .",
    "earlier on @xcite , we have determined the low - density spinodal line @xmath67 above which the solvated electrons become thermodynamically unstable .",
    "now we evaluate the high - density counterpart of the spinodal line @xmath68 corresponding to the zero derivative of the excess chemical potentials or the excess pressure : @xmath69 since the main part of the excess free energy in the metallic phase is coming from the degenerate electron gas , the high - density spinodal @xmath68 will depend weakly on temperature .    for any second - order phase transition",
    "there are two curves : the spinodal and the binodal ones , the last curve corresponds to the liquid - liquid coexistence . as we explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the low- and high - density spinodals are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . in principle , to calculate the coexistence curve , we need a complete knowledge of the excess free energy @xmath70 in the whole range of density , which is beyond the current status of our theory",
    ". however , we may use the following argument to estimate the high - density part of the coexistence curve : the excess pressures of the low - density and high - density phases must be equal ( this is the coexistence condition ) .",
    "but we know that the excess pressure of the low density phase is roughly close to zero ( more exactly it is in the order of @xmath71),@xcite whereas the excess pressure of the metallic phase strongly varies with @xmath23",
    ". therefore , we assert that the coexistence curve @xmath72 at high density will be roughly given by the condition : @xmath73    the critical concentration @xmath68 defines the low - density limit of the absolute stability of the metallic phase , whereas the critical concentration @xmath74 is close to the line of liquid - liquid coexistence . the metallic phase can not exist below @xmath68 , and in the range @xmath75 the solution is not homogeneous ( the pressure becomes negative ) and consists of domains of the metallic phase together with nonmetallic islands being nuclei of the low density phase , i.e. the solvated electron phase .",
    "the uniform metallic phase remains stable for densities @xmath76 .",
    "our input phenomenological parameters are @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 . for the pure ammonia solvent , we take @xmath77 , @xmath78c@xmath79 , and @xmath80k@xmath81.@xcite we use the data on the ammonia density , @xcite namely , @xmath82@xmath83 at @xmath84c . in order to take into account phenomenologically the influence of free electrons on the high - frequency dielectric constant ,",
    "we apply : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the relative fraction of the metal in the solution , and @xmath87 is a phenomenological parameter . in general ,",
    "the low - frequency dielectric constant @xmath13 may deviate also from the bulk value @xmath88 due to saturation of orientational polarization in the vicinity of ions .",
    "simple estimates show that the low - frequency constant can decrease down to 9 .",
    "@xcite therefore , different values for @xmath13 could also be tested .",
    "the core - radii and van - der - waals radii can be extracted from the literature , which we do in our first parameterization ( model 1 ) .",
    "however , as we discussed above , this does not take properly into account the fact that the ions are solvated .",
    "then we propose a second procedure to evaluate these radii , that we call model 2 .",
    "* model 1 . * the ion - core radii @xmath66 are obtained from the data on simple metals .",
    "@xcite although we do not find suitable estimates of van - der - waals radii @xmath15 for ions solvated in ammonia , we have used those of hydrated ions , assuming that the solvation properties of water are not so different from those of ammonia .",
    "we take the values for @xmath15 from ref .",
    "@xcite . that gives the values",
    "reported in table 1 ( at the lines : model 1 ) . finally , in this first model",
    ", we apply the phenomenological parameter @xmath89 , that takes into account the volume fraction occupied by the metal as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "* model 2 . * for this model , the phenomenological constant @xmath87 is used as a fitting parameter of experimental data on plasmon excitation measured in li - nh@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite it is experimentally found @xmath90 at 20 mpm so that @xmath91",
    ". as discussed above , the case of li raises a question , since the core radii obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite do not take into account the solvation shell of the ion .",
    "we use @xmath66 as a parameter to fit the experimental data on the phase coexistence , which is known for na - nh@xmath3 , li - nh@xmath3 , and k - nh@xmath3 solutions .",
    "@xcite we fit these data by ( [ zero ] ) , and obtain the values for the effective ion - core radius .",
    "a similar method is often used to fit ion - core radii for simple liquid metals .",
    "@xcite comparing @xmath66 to @xmath15 for model 1 , we find a proportionality constant of about @xmath92 for na - nh@xmath3 .",
    "then we use the same proportionality constant to deduce @xmath15 from @xmath66 for li , k , and rb , which gives the values reported in table 1 ( at lines : model 2 ) .",
    "parameters of the metal ions and the calculated critical densities for models 1 and 2 .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "using the formulas described above , we have calculated the excess chemical potential and the excess pressure for the metallic phase of na - nh@xmath3 solutions .",
    "figure 1 shows the concentration dependencies of these thermodynamic characteristics at various temperatures for model 1 . as can be seen , the chemical potential has the minimum at @xmath93 mpm and the pressure is negative below @xmath94 mpm at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the metallic phase is not stable at densities lower than @xmath95 . this instability results from coulomb correlations between delocalized electrons , because the main contribution to this compressibility is due to the deg .",
    "it is well known ( see f.e .",
    "@xcite ) that the compressibility of a pure deg in jellium ( without polarizable medium ) , becomes negative at @xmath96 and its pressure is negative for @xmath97 , which would correspond to @xmath98 mpm and @xmath99 mpm , respectively .",
    "these estimates are far from the experimental values in mas , which clearly indicates that the high solvent polarizability and strong dielectric screening of ions stabilize the deg in mas to lower metal concentrations .",
    "the temperature influence on the stability is due to the ionic contribution , and it is as small as it should be for a quantum phase transition .",
    "the critical concentration @xmath95 varies only from 5.5 to 4.5 mpm as the temperature changes by @xmath100 c. the critical concentrations obtained are sensitive to the choice of the input parameters @xmath66 , @xmath101 , and @xmath87 .",
    "figures 2 - 4 show the variations of these critical concentrations with respect to these parameters .",
    "a decreasing contribution of the solvent polarizability tends mainly to destabilize the metallic phase , since @xmath102 , and an increasing ion - core radius promotes the phase stability at lower densities .    in our theory",
    ", we can estimate the miscibility gap by considering the range between the critical lines obtained at low density @xmath67 ( our previous paper @xcite ) and the present calculations of @xmath68 . both the lines @xmath103 and @xmath68 give the locus of the low- and high - density spinodals , while the range @xmath104 correspond to the miscibility gap .",
    "the results calculated at @xmath105c are listed in table 1 .",
    "we find that the gap decreases monotonically as the ion size rises as it happens for simple metals and the gap disappears for heavy ions like cs , which is experimentally confirmed .",
    "@xcite although these qualitative predictions provide a correct trend for the miscibility gap versus the ion size , the estimates based on the ion - core parameter derived from the theory of simple metals@xcite ( our model 1 ) do not yield accurate evaluations of the phase separation range in case of li - nh@xmath3 .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is a peculiarity of local microstructure around the solvated ions , as we discussed above .",
    "namely , the size of the li ion is small , and the coordination number for the solvated li ions is small too in comparison to other ions . as a result ,",
    "the delocalized electrons scatter on the solvated li - nh@xmath3 complexes rather than on the cores of li ions , and the effective ion - core size deviates sufficiently from the value obtained for simple metals .",
    "this drawback disappears when we apply model 2 and use the data on @xmath66 fitting the zero - pressure condition ( [ zero ] ) at the coexistence line .",
    "the critical concentrations @xmath106 and @xmath95 calculated in this manner correspond much better to the experimental data ( see table 1 ) ; in particular , they yield the correct trend in the range @xmath107 of the phase separation , namely , @xmath0(na)@xmath108(li)@xmath1k@xmath2 .",
    "both models 1 and 2 also indicate the absence of the phase separation in cs - nh@xmath3 solutions , while our results for rb - nh@xmath3 solutions exhibit a possibility a phase separation for model 2 and absence for model 1 .",
    "the experimental evidence of such separation is not clear .",
    "there is no visible phase separation like in the li - nh@xmath3 solutions , @xcite although the measurements of conductivity @xcite and x - ray scattering @xcite indicate large fluctuations at @xmath109 4 mpm and at temperatures close to @xmath110k .",
    "those fluctuations can be interpreted as an indirect evidence of a phase separation for rb - nh@xmath3 solutions in this range .",
    "@xcite    we have also evaluated the compressibility @xmath63 as a function of the metal concentration @xmath23 in the framework of model 2 .",
    "the inverse compressibility @xmath111 calculated is shown in fig .",
    "5 together with the experimental data derived from the measurements of plasmon excitations @xcite obtained for the metallic na - nh@xmath3 and li - nh@xmath3 solutions above the consolute point @xmath5 .",
    "as can be seen , there is a qualitative agreement between the calculated and the experimental data .",
    "both indicate that the inverse compressibility decreases as the metal concentration decreases .",
    "however , the theoretical evaluation gives a much higher compressibility than the experimental measurements at intermediate densities .",
    "the deviations are more pronounced as the concentration decreases . in our opinion",
    ", it is an indirect evidence of the formation of an inhomogeneous electronic state consisting of a microscopic mixture of delocalized and localized electrons , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec32 ] .    finally , with the use of the calculated compressibility we can evaluate the low - frequency dielectric response of the metallic state at small wave - vectors ( @xmath112 ) , since we have the limiting relation for this function , as it takes place for the usual electron gas : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the thomas - fermi screening wave vector equal to @xmath115 ( @xmath116 being the bohr radius ) , and @xmath117 is the compressibility of the ideal fermi gas .",
    "the function @xmath118 is depicted in fig .",
    "6 at various metal concentrations .",
    "this function becomes negative at concentrations below @xmath68 , which confirms that the region of phase separation is indeed a region where the static dielectric constant must be negative .",
    "@xcite    the experimental phase diagram of sodium - ammonia solutions @xcite together with the different calculated critical lines corresponding to various instabilities of the nonmetallic and the metallic phases are depicted in fig .",
    "the low - density and the high - density spinodals correspond to the critical lines @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , and the line @xmath119 of polarization catastrophe ( see paper @xcite ) gives the onset of the mnm transition . although our calculations of critical lines roughly correspond to the experimental situation , the experimental coexistence line coincides with the theoretical zero - pressure line of the metallic phase only at low temperatures and deviates significantly from it as the temperature rises .",
    "the situation is similar for the calculated low - density and high - density parts of the spinodal curve , they do not cross as they should at the consolute point @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , at this stage of the theory , our model of the uniform metallic state and the homogeneous phase of solvated electrons phase can not explain all the peculiarities of the phase behavior of mas , although it indicates the main features of this behavior , namely , the existence of a miscibility gap giving rise to a phase separation .      to qualitatively understand what happens in the intermediate region , we have calculated the difference @xmath121 between the excess free energies of the nonmetallic and the metallic phases .",
    "following our previous study , @xcite the free energy per electron in the nonmetallic state can be expressed as : @xmath122\\frac{1}{2r_{e } } + 4\\pi c_{s}\\lambda r_{e}^{2}+ \\frac{4\\pi c_{v}n_{nh_3}}{3\\beta } r_{e}^{3}+   \\\\ & + & 2\\beta^{-1 } \\left [ \\ln ( n\\lambda_i^{3/2}\\lambda_e^{3/2})-1+\\frac{\\eta_{nm } ( 4 - 3\\eta_{nm } ) } { ( 1-\\eta_{nm } ) ^{2}}\\right]-\\frac{2}{\\epsilon _ { s}[\\sigma + \\gamma ^{-1}]}+\\frac{\\gamma ^{3}}{3\\pi n\\beta } -\\frac{c_{\\alpha } n r_{e}^{3}}{\\varepsilon _ { \\infty } ^{2 } } , \\nonumber \\label{fhs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are numerical coefficients that we have already discussed in ref .",

    "the first row of the expression yields the solvation free energy of noninteracting electrons , and the second row results from electron - electron interactions and includes short - range , electrostatic , and dispersion contributions , respectively .",
    "all these contributions are only corrections to the free - energy of the electron solvation energy .",

    "the difference @xmath140 is shown in fig . 8a .",
    "the main point to underline is that their difference remains in the order of only a few @xmath141 along the range of concentration 1 - 10 mpm , although the values of the free energies of the metallic and non - metallic state are both in the order of -0.7 ev .",
    "we should emphasize that this is not by chance . by carefully examining ( and simplifying ) the energy of both the metallic and non - metallic states",
    ", we can indicate that the main part of the energies coming from the electronic part is roughly given by : @xmath142 where @xmath60 stands for the metallic phase , and @xmath132 for the nonmetallic one . that clearly indicates a crossing between the two energies when @xmath143 tends to @xmath144 , which is in quantitative agreement with the results shown in fig . 8a .",
    "consequently , the thermal fluctuations between these electronic states must play a central role at intermediate densities , in particular to allow the closure of the miscibility gap at the critical temperature @xmath145 by a mixing entropy effect .",

    "this is sketched on fig .",
    "9 by the total inverse compressibility of the mixture .",
    "the total compressibility is well given by the sum of the inverse compressibility for each species ( solvated electrons and delocalized ones ) at the respective densities @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "at the same time , the dielectric constant remains finite at the line of the minimum inverse compressibility , although it rises sharply in the nonmetallic phase close to this line , as discussed in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the mixed state qualitatively described here , is of a new kind in condensed matter ( to our knowledge ) , and really results from the competition , driven by strong thermal fluctuations , between the delocalized and the self - trapped quantum states .",
    "the situation is more simple below @xmath5 .",
    "there is a finite range of densities between the spinodal and binodal curves at each side of the phase diagram , where the minority phase may nucleate in the majority phase to form some kind of stable electronic microemulsion .",
    "this microemulsion phase would be characterized by a large variety of aggregates as reported in numerical simulations @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the solution is phase separated below the spinodal line to prevent negative compressibility .",
    "10 summarizes all these effects .",
    "the mnm transition may be assigned to the line of the minimum inverse compressibility which crosses the spinodal and coexistence lines at the critical point @xmath150 .",
    "a more detailed theory of all these effects will be proposed in our future publication as well as more precise calculations of the spinodal and coexistence lines @xcite .",
    "we have only qualitatively discussed in this paragraph the main features of the phase diagram resulting from our model .",
    "thus , using the methods of non ideal plasma , we have evaluated the behavior of the pure metallic phase in mas .",
    "we have asserted that this behavior is mainly controlled by the state of degenerate electron gas .",
    "due to high polarizability of ammonia and high dielectric screening of ions solvated in mas , the gas remains stable up to values of @xmath143 of about 11 , which is quite different from simple metals where available values of @xmath143 do not exceed 6 .",
    "the pure metallic phase is unstable at metal concentrations lower than 5 mpm . comparing this critical concentration @xmath95 with the critical concentration @xmath67",
    "corresponding to the van - der - waals instability of solvated electrons , we have evaluated the range @xmath0 of the phase separation and found it to be governed by the ion - core size , the range decreasing as the ion - core size rises . by evaluating the ion - core size with the use of the zero - pressure condition applied to the coexistence line",
    ", we have obtained the correct trend in the range of the phase separation , namely , @xmath151(na)@xmath152(li)@xmath1k@xmath2 .",
    "the phase separation does not occur in cs - nh@xmath3 solutions and is rather narrow in the case of rb - nh@xmath3 .    comparing the calculated free energy of pure metallic and nonmetallic phases , we have asserted the difference between the energies to be small due to minor differences in the energy of polaron formation and that of electron gas at the stability boundary .",
    "this leads to a strong influence of thermal fluctuations on the nature of the mnm transition , which becomes continuous above the critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "a thermally fluctuating inhomogeneous electronic mixture arises .",
    "it modifies substantially the criterion for the mnm transition , because this transition should be attributed to the line of the minimum inverse compressibility or to the maximum scattering factor .",
    "this line is quite close to our previous estimates @xmath119 corresponding to the polarization catastrophe and divergent dielectric constant , @xcite although the dielectric constant remains finite at temperatures exceeding @xmath5 .    at the same time , the dielectric constant and the compressibility must be negative below the spinodal line . to avoid such negativity , the system macroscopically separates into the metallic and nonmetallic phases below the spinodal line . a new electronic state arises in the range restricted by the spinodal and the binodal lines .",
    "this state can be characterized as an electronic microemulsion .",
    "the locus of the critical point @xmath153 and the spinodal line is determined by the thermodynamic behavior of microemulsion and will be the subject of our next study .",
    "@xcite concerning the criterion for the mnm transition , we should note that it is quite different from the one for usual semiconductors @xcite and indicates a sufficient role of thermal fluctuations in the mechanism of mnm transitions . on the other hand",
    ", the line of the minimum inverse compressibility always exists for the second order transitions in simple @xcite and molecular @xcite liquids as well as for self - assembled networks .",
    "@xcite this line crosses the spinodal line at the critical point .",
    "that is the reason why the mnm transition couples with the phase separation in mas .                                                                                                                                     in mas at @xmath149 k. the solid curve indicates our calculations in the case of li - nh@xmath3 ( model 2 ) , and the diamonds are the experimental data from @xcite , the dashed curve and the squares are the same in the case of na - nh@xmath3 solutions . ]",
