    "over the past decade , experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl have studied the hot and dense medium created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the suppression of high - transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) inclusive hadrons  @xcite , indicative of jet quenching , corroborates the conclusion that the medium created is opaque to colored energetic partons  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as a result of the medium - induced radiative energy loss of a hard - scattered parton as it traverses the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the angular correlation of charged hadrons with respect to a direct - photon ( @xmath0 ) trigger was proposed as a promising probe to study the mechanisms of parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a `` trigger '' particle , having @xmath8  greater than some selected value , serves as part of the selection criteria to analyze the event for a hard scattering .",
    "direct photons are produced during the early stage of the collision , through leading - order pqcd processes such as quark - gluon compton scattering ( @xmath9 ) and quark - antiquark pair annihilation ( @xmath10 ) . in these processes",
    "the transverse energy of the trigger photon approximates the initial @xmath8  of the outgoing recoil parton , before the recoiling ( `` away - side '' ) parton likely loses energy while traversing the medium and fragments into a jet .",
    "the jet - like yields associated with a trigger particle are estimated by integrating the correlated yields of charged hadrons over azimuthal distance from the trigger particle ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "any suppression of the charged - hadron per - trigger yields in the away - side jets in central au+au collisions is then quantified by contrasting to the per - trigger yields measured in @xmath2 collisions , via the ratio of integrated yields , @xmath12  @xcite ( defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : iaa ] ) .",
    "when requiring a hadron trigger ( such as a @xmath1 ) , the @xmath8  of the recoiling parton ( and hence the away - side jet ) is not as well approximated by the transverse energy of the trigger .",
    "for example , the pythia monte carlo simulator  @xcite shows that , in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3@xmath13 200  gev , a @xmath1  trigger with @xmath8  @xmath14 12 gev/@xmath15  carries , on average , only @xmath16 of the original scattered parton s @xmath8 . this percentage from pythia is consistent with the values extracted from this analysis , as described below .    despite this complication",
    ", it is compelling to compare the suppression for @xmath0  triggers with that for @xmath1  triggers because of the expected differences in geometrical biases at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath1  trigger is likely to have been produced near the surface of the medium , the @xmath0  trigger does not suffer the same bias , since the photon mean free path is much larger than the size of the medium . comparing @xmath0- and @xmath1-triggered yields",
    "offers further opportunities to explore the geometric biases and their interplay with parton energy loss .",
    "a next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculation  @xcite suggests that production of hadrons at different @xmath17 is also affected by different geometric biases , where @xmath6@xmath7 ( @xmath5  and @xmath4  are transverse momenta of associated and triggered particles , respectively ) represents the ratio of the transverse momentum carried by a charged hadron in the recoil jet to that of the trigger particle .",
    "the high-@xmath6  hadrons in a jet recoiling from a @xmath0 preferentially originate from a parton scattering near the away - side surface of the medium , since scatterings deeper in the medium will result in a stronger degradation of the high - momentum components of the jet .",
    "the high-@xmath6 hadrons in a jet recoiling from a @xmath18 preferentially emerge from scatterings tangential to the surface from the already biased surface - dominated trigger jets ( which is consistent with observations in  @xcite ) .",
    "these two mechanisms turn out to lead to the same level of suppression  @xcite . only at low @xmath6",
    "does the full sampling of the volume by @xmath0 triggers show a predicted difference from that of the surface - dominated @xmath1 triggers",
    ".    an additional effect at low @xmath17 may be the redistribution of the parton s lost energy within the low - momentum jet fragments  @xcite , which is not included in the calculation  @xcite described above .",
    "this was studied by the phenix collaboration , which found an enhancement at low @xmath17 and large angles , for direct photon triggers with @xmath19 in the range of @xmath20  gev/@xmath15  at @xmath3  = 200  gev in the most central au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "enhancements due to this mechanism would be expected in hadrons recoiling from other triggers as well , such as @xmath18 or jets .",
    "a previous star measurement of hadrons associated with a reconstructed jet have shown an enhancement for @xmath8  @xmath21  gev/@xmath15 , for two classes of jets with broadly separated energy scales , in which the enhancement at low @xmath22 balances the suppression at high @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , leading order di - jet production comes from both quark and gluon jets .",
    "recent calculations show that pions with high @xmath8  relative to the total jet @xmath8  are predominantly from quark jets  @xcite , so , for the jet energies probed in this paper , the away - side mainly comes from gluon jets  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the away - side of a @xmath0  trigger , which mainly comes from quark jets , since at leading order a photon does not couple with a gluon .",
    "thus it is expected that , on average , the away - side parton associated with a @xmath1  suffers more energy loss than that of a @xmath0  due to the additional color factor from gluons . by comparing the suppression of away - side associated hadrons for @xmath0",
    "triggers to that for @xmath1  triggers , one can gain information about both the path - length and the color - factor dependence of parton energy loss .",

    "bemc towers ( each covering 0.05 units in @xmath27 and @xmath30 ) provide a measurement of the energy of electromagnetic clusters , whereas the bsmd , due to its high granularity ( 0.007 units in @xmath27 and @xmath30 ) , provides high spatial resolution for the center of a cluster and the transverse development of the shower .",

    "in summary , in order to understand the medium modification of partons in the qgp , away - side charged - hadron yields for @xmath0  and @xmath1  triggers in central ( 0 - 12@xmath69 ) au+au collisions are compared with those in minimum - bias @xmath2 collisions .",
    "both @xmath97  and @xmath98  show similar levels of suppression , with the expected differences due to the color - factor effect and the path - length dependence not manifesting themselves within experimental uncertainties . at low @xmath6  and low @xmath5 ,",
    "the data are consistent with less suppression than at higher @xmath5 .",
    "the suppression shows little difference for integration windows of @xmath122  0.6 vs. @xmath122  1.4  radians around @xmath123 , with an enhancement at large angles observed only for @xmath6  @xmath111 ( @xmath5  @xmath124   gev/@xmath15 ) for @xmath1  triggers .",
    "there is no trigger - energy dependence observed in the suppression of @xmath0-triggered yields , suggesting little dependence for energy loss on the initial parton energy , in the range of @xmath4  @xmath125  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "the data are consistent with model calculations  @xcite , in which the suppression is caused by parton energy loss in a thermalized medium",

    "the very large @xmath98  at low @xmath6  predicted by models of in - medium shower modification ( including energy redistribution )  @xcite is not observed for @xmath4  @xmath126  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "this is in contrast to the phenix result  @xcite , where the @xmath98  exceeds unity , for @xmath4  @xmath20  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "however , it is not clear that the redistribution of lost energy would scale with the jet energy .",
    "in fact , our studies support previous conclusions that the lost energy reappears predominantly at low @xmath8  ( approximately @xmath8  @xmath127  gev/@xmath15 ) , regardless of the trigger @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to the important conclusion that the modified fragmentation function is not universal ( _ i.e. _ it does not have the same @xmath17 dependence for all trigger @xmath8 ) .",
