    "this results is comparable with the constraints from the _ gold07 _ sample for the same parameterization ( see subsection 2.2 ) .",
    "it is also interesting that the davis _ et al .",
    "_ sample also suggests ( for both parameterizations ) the existence of a transition redshift in the future ( @xmath134 ) . such a possibility it will be discussed with more detail in a forthcoming communication ( lima and cunha 2008 ) .",
    "at this point it is interesting to investigate how a joint analysis constrains the redshift evolution of the decelerating parameter .",
    "however , since the time evolutions are quite similar for the different parameterizations , in what follows we focus our attention on the _ _ gold__07 sample .",
    "the basic results are displayed in figures 8a and 8b .    in figs .",
    "8a we see the evolution of the decelerating parameter as a function of the redshift for the parameterization @xmath39 .",
    "the shadow denotes the 2@xmath106 region .    in fig 8b",
    "the evolution is shown for a two - parameter expansion history driven by @xmath123 .",
    "for both cases , we also show the lower and upper values ( @xmath44 ) of the transition redshifts which is defined by the condition ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "note also that for both parameterizations the data favor the recent acceleration ( @xmath102 ) and past deceleration ( @xmath103 ) with high confidence level .    in table 1",
    "we summarize the basic constraints on the transition redshift ( @xmath36 ) established in the present work .",
    "as shown there , for a given phenomenological law the limits were derived separately for each sample of sne type ia data .",
    "the most remarkable dynamical feature distinguishing dark energy and matter dominated models is the present accelerating stage .",
    "however , the observed structures must be formed in a past decelerated phase dominated by matter .",
    "this leads naturally to a dynamic phase transition from decelerating to accelerating in the course of the universe s evolution .",
    "this is the most natural scenario within the framework of the general relativity .",
    "it has been confirmed by several disparate observations ranging from the anisotropy of the cmb , sne ia , galaxy clusters , age of the universe , however , even considering the high - quality of the present data the whole set is still compatible with many different dark energy models .",
    "the basic information about the deceleration parameter has been obtained here through a model independent analysis using two different phenomenological laws , namely : @xmath135 , as proposed by riess _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) and @xmath123 ( xu _ et al .",
    "the contours to the plane ( @xmath2 ) and the likelihood function for transition redshift were discussed in detail with basis on the data sample by riess _",

    "( 2006 ) and davis _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) . in order to compare the predictions ,",
    "we have presented the analysis first for each sample separately . as we have seen , although considering the presence of no transition regions ( see figs .",
    "2a , 3a , 4a , 5a , 6a and 7a ) , both sample strongly favor a universe with recent acceleration ( @xmath72 ) and previous deceleration ( @xmath73 ) .    the likelihood function for the transition redshift is more well defined for the riess",

    "we summarize the main results related to the transition redshift @xmath36 in the present kinematic approach . for both samples , our analysis provides a model independent evidence that a dynamic phase transition from decelerating to accelerating happened at redshifts smaller than unity .",
    "hopefully , the constraints on @xmath36 will be considerably improved in the near future with the increasing of supernovae data at intermediate and high redshifts .",
