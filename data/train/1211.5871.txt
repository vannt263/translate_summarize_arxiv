    "one of the main interests in hypernuclear physics is to investigate how an addition of a @xmath0 particle influences the structure of atomic nuclei .",
    "a characteristic feature of the @xmath0 particle is that it is free from the pauli principle for nucleons , and thus it can deeply penetrate into the nuclear interior .",
    "a @xmath0 particle may modify several properties of nuclei , such as nuclear size@xcite , the density distribution@xcite , deformation properties @xcite , the neutron drip - line@xcite , and fission barrier@xcite .    in this contribution , we discuss the impurity effect of a @xmath0 particle on collective excitations .",
    "it is well known that low - lying states in even - even nuclei show a collective character , strongly reflecting the shell structure and pairing correlation .",
    "these collective excitations are one of the most important aspects of many - body systems , and have been extensively studied in the past .",
    "two types of collective motion are well known : a rotational motion of deformed nuclei and a vibrational motion of spherical nuclei . in this paper",
    ", we particularly investigate the ground state rotational band of a deformed hypernucleus as well as the low - lying dipole motion of a spherical hypernucleus .    in the next section ,",
    "we first discuss the deformation properties of hypernuclei in the @xmath1-shell region . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the rotational motion of a deformed hypernucleus , @xmath3 mg . to this end",
    ", we employ the collective hamiltonian approach based on the density functional theory . in section 4",
    ", we discuss vibrational excitations of a spherical hypernucleus , @xmath5o .",
    "we particularly study the dipole motion , and show that a new dipole mode appears in hypernuclei , which is absent in ordinary nuclei .",
    "we then summarize the paper in section 5 .",
    "it is well known that many open - shell nuclei are deformed in the ground state . a clear evidence for nuclear deformation is provided by a rotational spectrum , which scales as @xmath6 as a function of the angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "in order to investigate how the nuclear deformation is affected by a @xmath0 particle , we employ the self - consistent mean - field theory @xcite . with this method ,",
    "the optimum density distribution is obtained automatically by minimizing the total energy , and thus it is well suited for a discussion of polarization effects due to a @xmath0 particle .",
    "it is probably ofka who applied the self - consistent method to deformed hypernuclei for the first time @xcite .",
    "he used gaussian interactions for nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) and nucleon - lambda ( @xmath9 ) interactions and showed that a @xmath0 particle changes the quadrupole moment , which is proportional to the deformation parameter , at most by 5 % in the @xmath1-shell region .",
    "this result is consistent with the results of more recent skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) calculations for axially deformed hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "we carry out a similar study using the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) method as an alternative choice of effective @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions @xcite . in the rmf approach ,",
    "nucleons and a @xmath0 particle are treated as structureless dirac particles interacting through the exchange of virtual mesons , that is , the isoscalar scalar @xmath10 meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath11 meson , and the isovector vector @xmath12 meson@xcite ( see also ref .",

    "the pairing correlation among the nucleons is also taken into account in the constant gap approximation .",
    "the dashed lines show the deformation parameter for the even - even core nuclei , while the solid lines are for the corresponding hypernuclei .",
    "we see that the change in the deformation parameter for most of the nuclei shown in the figure is small , being consistent with the previous non - relativistic self - consistent calculations @xcite . however , we find a few important exceptions .",

    "the energy surfaces for the corresponding core nuclei are also shown .",
    "in order to facilitate the comparison , we shift the energy surface for the hypernuclei by a constant amount as indicated in the figures .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath16ne nucleus , which has a deep prolate minimum in the energy surface , the energy surface for the @xmath2si nucleus shows a relatively shallow oblate minimum , with a shoulder at the spherical configuration . the energy difference between the oblate and the spherical configurations is 0.754 mev , and could be easily inverted when a @xmath0 particle is added .",
    "the disppearance of nuclear deformation was not observed in the previous shf calculations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have compared the shf and rmf approaches and have shown that the different results between the two approaches with respect to nuclear deformation come about because the rmf yields a somewhat stronger polarization effect of the @xmath0 hyperon than that of the shf approach .",
    "we have shown that the deformation disappears also in the shf approach if the energy difference between the optimum deformation and the spherical configuration is less than about 1 mev @xcite .",
    "our rmf calculations indicate that the oblate deformation of the @xmath17c nucleus also disappears when a @xmath0 particle is added @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the recent anti - symmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculation by isaka _",
    "et al . _ also exhibits a similar disappearance of deformation for the @xmath17c nucleus@xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we presented results of rmf calculations , in which the axially symmetric shape of hypernuclei was assumed .",
    "subsequently , three - dimensional ( 3d ) mean - field calculations have also been performed both with shf @xcite and rmf @xcite , taking into account triaxial deformation , @xmath18 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the rotational spectra of deformed hypernuclei on the basis of such 3d calculations with shf .    in order to obtain a spectrum with the density functional theory",
    ", one has to go beyond the mean field approximation , in which a many - body wave function is assumed to be given by a single slater determinant .",
    "one standard way to do so is to perform generator - coordinate - method ( gcm ) calculations , in which many slater determinants are superposed after angular - momentum and particle - number projections @xcite .",
    "it is , however , still difficult to apply it to odd - mass nuclei , such as single-@xmath0 hypernuclei , which has a half - integer spin and in which the time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "we therefore employ the five dimensional collective bohr hamiltonian approach @xcite .",
    "this is based on the so called gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) to gcm , in which the overlap between two slater determinants behaves as a gaussian function of a generator coordinate .    in this method ,",
    "the collective hamiltonian for a quadrupole motions , with the intrinsic ( deformation ) coordinates of @xmath19 and @xmath18 together with the three - dimensional spatial rotation , is constructed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the kinetic energy operator for the vibrational motions , while @xmath22 is the collective potential . the vibrational moment inertia in @xmath21 and the rotational moment of inertia @xmath23 in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ hcoll ] ) are calculated with the cranking approximation using the single - particle wave functions .",
    "the collective potential @xmath22 is calculated as a sum of the total energy in the mean - field approximation and corrections due to the vibrational and rotational zero point motions .",
    "based on the idea of the particle - rotor / vibrator model , the total hamiltonian for hypernuclei can be divided into the collective part for the nuclear core , the single - particle part for hyperon , and the interaction part between the nuclear core and hyperon@xcite . in this article , we focus on how the core nucleus is modified by the addition of a @xmath0 particle@xcite .",
    "we therefore apply the collective hamiltonian approach only to the collective part of the hamiltonian for the nuclear core , @xmath24 we mention that there is a small ambiguity here concerning how to define the collective potential for the core nucleus , @xmath25 , due to the @xmath9 interaction in the energy functional . here",
    "we consider two options : in one option , the @xmath9 interaction is not included in @xmath25 at all ( this option is labeled as `` w / o '' below ) , and in the other the whole of the @xmath9 interaction is included in @xmath25 ( labeled as `` w '' ) .",

    "3 shows the probability distribution in the @xmath27 deformation plane for the ground state of @xmath26 mg when the @xmath0 particle is absent ( the left panel ) and present ( the right panel ) . to this end",

    "@xcite for the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "we take the option `` w '' for the contribution of the @xmath9 interaction to the collective potential .",
    "one finds that the @xmath0 particle slightly shifts the probability distribution towards the smaller deformation region .",
    "the average values for @xmath19 and @xmath18 are 0.54 and 20.0@xmath28 , respectively , for the @xmath26 mg nucleus without @xmath0 , which are altered to 0.52 and 20.8@xmath28 when the @xmath0 particle is added .",
    "we find that the change in the proton radius is much smaller , only by around 0.5 % @xcite .",

    "one can see that the @xmath0 stretches the spectra of ground state band .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 particle increases the excitation energy of the @xmath32 state by @xmath33 . at the same time",
    ", it reduces the @xmath34 transition strength @xmath35 by @xmath36 . notice that since the @xmath0 particle is neutral - charge , the @xmath34 transition strength of the whole hypernucleus is given by the protons in the nuclear core .",
    "therefore , the calculated @xmath4 value of the nuclear core can be compared with the @xmath4 value of the hypernucleus .",
    "recent amd calculations indeed yield a similar reduction in the @xmath4 value for @xmath3 mg , although they suggest a compression of the rotational spectrum @xcite",

    "let us next discuss vibrational excitations of spherical hypernuclei . for vibrational excitations ,",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) has provided a convenient and useful method @xcite .",
    "this method describes a small amplitude oscillation around the hartree - fock minimum in the potential energy surface .",
    "the excited phonon states are thus given in this method as a superposition of many 1-particle 1-hole states .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to many nuclei in order to describe low - lying collective vibrations as well as several types of giant resonances .",
    "e.g. , _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent application to the giant dipole resonance in the nd and sm isotopes .",
    "one can generalize this scheme to hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "as in the previous section , an application to single-@xmath0 hypernuclei is complicated , and in this article we consider only double-@xmath0 hypernuclei , for which the ground state always has a spin and parity of 0@xmath37 .",
    "such calculations will provide the upper limit of the impurity effect for single-@xmath0 hypernuclei . in rpa , excited states of hypernuclei are built onto the ground state @xmath38 as @xmath39 with @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the forward and backward amplitudes , respectively . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the creation operators for a particle state @xmath45 ( _ i.e. , _ a single - particle state above the fermi energy ) and for a hole state @xmath46 ( _ i.e. , _ a single - particle state below the fermi energy ) , respectively , for protons , neutrons , and @xmath0 particles .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 , as well as the excitation energy @xmath47 are obtained by solving the rpa equations , which include residual interactions . the electric transition probabilities from the excited state to the ground state are computed as @xmath48 with the excitation operators of @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 ( that is , the e1 response ) , where @xmath53 is the center of mass of the hypernucleus , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the mass of nucleon and @xmath0 hyperon , respectively .",

    "the results for the lowest 2@xmath37 and 3@xmath60 states are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 particles slightly reduce the collectivity both for the quadrupole and octupole modes of excitations .",
    "that is , the excitation energies are increased while the electromagnetic transition probabilities are decreased by 26 - 28% .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the results for the rotational excitation presented in the previous section . in rpa , the increase in the excitation energies can be understood in terms of the change in neutron and proton single - particle energies due to the @xmath0 particles .",

    "this feature is similar to the low - lying states shown in table 1 .",
    "we have found that giant resonances with other multipolarities , such as giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) and giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) , show a similar behavior@xcite .",
    "in addition to the shift of the gdr peak , the dipole strength distribution for @xmath5o shows an additional peak at 11.4 mev .",
    "this peak appears only when the @xmath0 hyperons are added to the @xmath61o nucleus , and a similar peak is not seen in other modes of excitations .",
    "the strongest rpa amplitude , @xmath69 , contributing to this peak is the excitation of a @xmath0 particle from the 1@xmath70 to the 1@xmath45 states with @xmath71 .",
    "the total rpa amplitudes for the neutrons and the protons are small ( @xmath72 for the neutrons and @xmath73 for the protons ) , and these values become entirely zero when the @xmath64 interaction is switched off .",

    "5 shows the transition density for this low - lying dipole state .",
    "the neutrons and the protons oscillate in phase , while they move out of phase with the @xmath0 particles .",

    "we can therefore call the low - lying dipole peak in @xmath5o the soft dipole @xmath0 mode .",
    "one big difference from the soft dipole mode of halo nuclei is that the @xmath0 particles are located in the center of the hypernucleus whereas the valence neutrons are mainly located in the surface region in halo nuclei due to the pauli principle .",

    "we have shown that the deformation disappears for @xmath2si when a @xmath0 particle is added .",
    "for many other nuclei , the deformation becomes slightly smaller , although the change is not large .",
    "we have demonstrated that the dominant effect of the @xmath0 particle on nuclei in the @xmath1-shell region is to make the deformation smaller , rather than shrinking the size of the whole nucleus .",
    "this leads to a reduction of electromagnetic transition probabilities , as we have shown for the @xmath3 mg nucleus using the five dimensional collective bohr hamiltonian approach .",

    "we have shown that a new low - lying dipole mode appears in hypernuclei , which can be interpreted as a dipole oscillation of @xmath0 particles against the core nucleus .",
    "this is a similar mode as the soft dipole motion in halo nuclei , and thus we call it a soft dipole @xmath0 mode .    for both the collective hamiltonian and rpa approaches",
    ", it is significantly complicated to apply them to single-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "this involves odd - mass systems with half - integer spins and broken time reversal symmetry . in this article , we have avoided this difficulty by investigating only the core part of single - hypernuclei or by applying the theory to double - hypernuclei .",
