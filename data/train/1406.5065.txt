    "moreover , it has also been employed to study cooperative quantum phenomena like quantum phase transitions in many - body systems  @xcite . however , in the recent past , several quantum phenomena of shared systems have been discovered in which entanglement is either absent or does not play any significant role .",

    "@xcite ) is a prominent example where entanglement does not play an important role .",
    "the role of entanglement is also unclear in the model of deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit  @xcite .",
    "such phenomena motivated the search for concepts and measures of quantum correlation independent of the entanglement - separability paradigm .",
    "introduction of quantum discord  @xcite is one of the most important advancements in this direction and has inspired a lot of research activity  @xcite .",
    "it has thereby emerged that quantum correlations , independent of entanglement , can also be a useful ingredient in several quantum information processing tasks @xcite .",
    "other measures in the same direction include quantum work deficit  @xcite , measurement - induced nonlocality  @xcite , and quantum deficit  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these measures can be generally considered to be quantum correlation measures within an `` information - theoretic paradigm '' .",
    "in classical as well as quantum information theory , one of the most important pillars is the framework of entropy  @xcite , which quantifies the ignorance or lack of information in the relevant physical system .",
    "moreover , it helps to understand information theory from a thermodynamic perspective .",
    "almost all the quantum correlation measures incorporate entropic functions in various forms . and , most of the quantum correlation measures are defined by using the von neumann entropy  @xcite .",
    "the operational significance of von neumann entropy has been widely recognized in numerous scenarios in quantum information theory . nonetheless , there are classes of generalized entropies like the rnyi  @xcite and tsallis  @xcite entropies , which are also operationally significant in important physical scenarios .",
    "both the rnyi and tsallis entropies reduce to the von neumann entropy when the entropic parameter @xmath0 @xmath1 . for @xmath2",
    "the relative rnyi entropy appears in the quantum chernoff bound which determines the minimal probability of error in discriminating two different quantum states in the setting of asymptotically many copies  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the relative rnyi entropy is relevant in binary quantum state discrimination , for the same range of @xmath0 .",
    "the concept of rnyi entropy has also been found to be useful in the context of holographic theory  @xcite .",
    "it has also been found useful in dealing with several condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "the significance of the tsallis entropy in quantum information theory has been established in the context of quantifying entanglement  @xcite , local realism  @xcite , and entropic uncertainty relations  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "both the rnyi and tsallis entropies have important applications in classical as well as quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics  @xcite .    while there are important interpretational and operational breakthroughs that have been obtained by using the concept of quantum discord , there are also several intriguing unanswered questions and thriving controversies  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting and important to look back upon the conceptual foundations of quantum discord and inquire whether certain changes , subtle or substantial , in those concepts lead us to a better understanding of the controversies and the unanswered questions . towards this aim ,",
    "we introduce measures of the total , classical , and quantum correlations of a bipartite quantum state in terms of the entire class of relative rnyi and tsallis entropy distances .",
    "we show that the measures satisfy all the required properties of bipartite correlations .",
    "we then evaluate the quantum correlation measure for several paradigmatic classes of states . as an application",
    ", we find that the quantum correlation measures , via relative rnyi and tsallis entropies , can indicate quantum phase transitions and give better finite - size scaling exponents than the other known order parameters .",
    "importantly , we show that the conceptualization of the measures in terms of rnyi and tsallis entropies solves an incommodious feature regarding the behavior of nearest - neighbor quantum discord in a second order phase transition",
    ".    there are at least two distinct ways in which the relative rnyi and tsallis entropies are defined , and are usually referred to as the `` traditional ''  @xcite and `` sandwiched ''  @xcite varieties .",
    "the sandwiched varieties incorporate the noncommutative nature of density matrices in an elegant way , and it is therefore natural to expect that it will play an important role in fundamentals and applications .",
    "indeed , the sandwiched relative rnyi entropy has been used to show that the strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of a quantum channel holds for some specific channels  @xcite . moreover , an operational interpretation of the sandwiched relative rnyi entropy in the strong converse problem of quantum hypothesis testing is noted for @xmath3  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sandwiched relative tsallis entropy has recently been shown to be a better witness of entanglement @xcite than the traditional one @xcite .",
    "the relative min- and max - entropies @xcite , which can be obtained from the sandwiched relative rnyi entropy for specific choices of @xmath0 , play significant roles in providing bounds on errors of one - shot entanglement cost  @xcite , on the one - shot classical capacity of certain quantum channels  @xcite , and in several scenarios in non - asymptotic quantum information theory  @xcite . in ref .",

    "<S> quantum discord is a measure of quantum correlations beyond the entanglement - separability paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceptualized by using the von neumann entropy as a measure of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a class of quantum correlation measures as differences between total and classical correlations , in a shared quantum state , in terms of the sandwiched relative rnyi and tsallis entropies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those obtained by using the traditional relative entropies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the measures satisfy all the plausible axioms for quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the measures for shared pure as well as paradigmatic classes of mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the measures can faithfully detect the quantum critical point in the transverse quantum ising model and find that they can be used to remove an unquieting feature of nearest - neighbor quantum discord in this respect . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the measures provide better finite - size scaling exponents of the quantum critical point than the ones for other known order parameters , including entanglement and information - theoretic measures of quantum correlations . </S>"
