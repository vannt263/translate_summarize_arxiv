    "the solvation force @xmath4 is the force per unit area between two surfaces , large colloidal particles or macromolecules due to the intervening fluid .",
    "it arises in the thermodynamic description of confined fluids as an excess pressure over the bulk value ( fixed by the reservoir ) and is conjugate to the distance @xmath0 between the confining surfaces @xcite .",
    "the study of this generalized force for simple and complex fluids is useful as it may play an important role in the field of colloid sciences , in self - assembling systems and in the biology of protein folding . from a fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "solvation forces present an abundance of interesting problems to investigate : the behaviour at the phase transitions of a confined fluid , such as capillary condensation @xcite , bridging @xcite , localization - delocalization transition @xcite , or layering @xcite , the structure at small separations @xmath0 @xcite , or the dependence on the fluid - fluid interactions and the surface potentials @xcite .",
    "an addition appeal lies in the fact that it may be measured experimentally by a number of different techniques @xcite ; e.g. , the surface force apparatus , the atomic force microscope , or the total internal reflection microscopy ( timr ) @xcite . by using the latter technique ,",
    "the first direct determination of the universal contribution to @xmath4 between a single colloidal particle and a planar surface in the presence of a near - critical binary liquid mixture was provided @xcite .",
    "the universal contribution , called the critical casimir force @xcite , is induced by the confinement of critical fluctuations of the order parameter of the second order phase transition , e.g. the density of the fluid or the concentration of one species for a binary liquid mixture . at the bulk critical point",
    "this fluctuation - induced force has a leading power law decay @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spatial dimension of the system and @xmath8 is the casimir amplitude . the finite - size scaling theory predicts ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in the vicinity of the bulk critical point @xmath4 is described by a scaling function that depends on the so - called universality class of the phase transition occurring in the bulk and on the geometry and surface universality classes of the confining surfaces @xcite .",
    "the critical casimir force is a subject of recent considerable theoretical and experimental interest because at the submicron scale its strength and range is comparable with other interactions and because it can be easily controlled , including its sign , by changes of thermodynamic fields , such as the temperature , and by appropriate surface treatments .",
    "as mentioned above , the solvation force is associated with fluid - fluid interactions and the surface potential . in the present paper",
    "we want to study the relevant effects of long - ranged , i.e. , algebraically decaying forces on the near - critical behaviour of @xmath4 between two parallel walls and test predictions of the critical finite - size scaling theory .",
    "examples of such long - ranged forces are dispersion or van der waals forces , dipolar forces , rkky interactions , forces in charged systems , and elastic forces in solids . here",
    "we utilize the equivalence between a lattice gas model of a fluid and the ising model and consider ising spin films subject to identical boundary fields decaying in the orthogonal direction at a distance @xmath9 from the surface as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 . using the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method",
    ", we calculate the solvation force in two - dimensional ( @xmath13 ) systems along various thermodynamic paths .",
    "the dmrg method is based on the transfer matrix approach and provides a numerically very efficient iterative truncation algorithm for constructing the effective transfer matrices for strips of fixed width and infinite length .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can treat arbitrary fields that are coupled to the single spin variable .",
    "moreover , because the dmrg method gives quasi - exact results for the spectrum of the transfer matrix of the system , fluctuations are fully accounted for in this approach .",
    "recall , that in @xmath13 systems fluctuation effects are particularly strong .",
    "however , this method works only if the spin - spin interactions are nearest - neighbour and , at present , it is limited to the two - dimensional systems .",
    "the studies carried out here complement and extend the earlier works ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the solvation ( casimir ) force in the vicinity of the critical point is strongly influenced by capillary condensation , i.e. , the shift of the bulk first - order transition which occurs below the critical temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the residual condensation leads to the solvation force which is much more attractive at temperatures near @xmath14 and a reservoir densities slightly below the critical value ( or compositions slightly away from the critical composition in a binary mixture ) than the casimir value ( at the bulk critical point ) for the same @xmath0 .",
    "these predictions were supported by explicit calculations for @xmath13 ising films with _ short - ranged _ ( contact ) boundary fields . by using the dmrg method it was possible to study the region between the capillary and bulk critical points , i.e. , for nonvanishing ordering field @xmath15 , which corresponds to the chemical potential difference @xmath16 . in particular , the scaling functions of @xmath4 along several isotherms were obtained showing that upon increasing the temperature towards @xmath14 a weakly rounded in @xmath13 discontinuous jump of @xmath4 on crossing the coexistence line @xcite transforms gradually into a minimum .",
    "a location of this minimum follows roughly the continuation of the ( pseudo ) capillary condensation line towards @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the similar behaviour was found in the field - theoretic model solved numerically in the mean - field approximation @xcite , again for the short - ranged boundary fields .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the case of short - ranged fluid - fluid interaction and long - ranged wall - fluid potentials decaying as @xmath17 for @xmath18 was considered for @xmath13 ising films and for the truncated lennard - jones fluid in a slit geometry .",
    "the discrete model was treated within the dmrg method whereas the continuum one by the nonlocal density functional theory .",
    "the study was focused on the asymptotic behaviour of the solvation force as @xmath6 . except for a high temperature ising system ,",
    "results for both models agree with the predictions from the analysis based on the wall - particle ornstein - zernike equations that @xmath4 is repulsive and asymptotically decays with the same power law as the wall - fluid potential ; this prediction holds away from the critical temperature and from any phase transition . for ising films above @xmath14 the asymptotic behaviour",
    "was found to be of the higher order then that of the boundary field , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "this was explain by the specific symmetry of the order parameter with the spontaneous magnetization @xmath20 equal to zero above @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 was calculated along the _ bulk _ two - phase coexistence line slightly on the liquid side of this line and at the critical density for @xmath21 ; in the ising system this path corresponds to the line @xmath22 .",

    "close to the bulk critical temperature the solvation force changes its behaviour significantly , i.e. , the jump of @xmath4 transforms into a minimum , but the effects of ( pseudo ) capillary condensations remain strong .",
    "this manifests itself at small values of @xmath167 where we observe data collapse for all values of @xmath1 and where the scaling function varies as @xmath173 , which implies @xmath174 for small @xmath57 and fixed @xmath0 corresponding to the residual metastable bulk phase",
    ".    for @xmath67 and 3 , along the pseudo - coexistence line on its gas side and along the isotherms for large values of @xmath167 , the regular contribution ( [ eq:1 ] ) dominates the behaviour of the solvation force . because @xmath175 , at these thermodynamic points @xmath4 is attractive . on the liquid side of the pseudo - coexistence line and far away from ( pseudo ) capillary condensation and bulk criticality , @xmath4 becomes repulsive in agreement with ( [ eq:1 ] ) ( see also ref .",

    "the solvation force is attractive . in the case of short - range - like boundary potential @xmath60 , @xmath4 is always attractive .",
