    "a delay / disruption - tolerant network ( dtn ) routing in a store - carry - forward manner is useful especially for disasters , battlefields , and poor communication environments on mobile devices or ad hoc wireless connections @xcite .",
    "even if some connections are removed by failures or attacks , it is expected that a packet is delivered before very long in a dtn routing by re - establishing or re - generating an end - to - end route .",
    "there are many protocols in dtn routing methods @xcite .",
    "we focus on a message - ferries scheme @xcite instead of the most trivial approaches by flooding with a lot of redundant messages . in the message - ferries scheme ,",
    "ferries of communication agents move proactively to send and receive messages , and distributedly give support to the delivery of messages . in the dtn as a collective adaptive system ( cas )",
    ", it is very important how to design the interactions among message - ferries in what type of moves or actions .",
    "we have proposed the searching and routing methods by message - ferries where actions obey random walks on a fractal - like network @xcite .",
    "the methods are better than the conventional optimal search by biophysically inspired lvy flights on a square lattice @xcite for homogeneously distributed targets at unknown positions , because the fractal - like network structure is adaptive to the uneven distribution of communication flows between send and receive requests according to spatially inhomogeneous population densities .",
    "however , random walks are predominated by contingency . for a higher reliable dtn routing",
    ", we consider a design principle of configuration and autonomous actions with recoverable procedures in cas .",
    "it is based on the cooperation in cyclic moving of message - ferries on the multi - scale quartered ( msq ) network taking into account several advantages of the special fractal - like structure @xcite . moreover , we give an estimation procedure for the optimal service rates of message - ferries from a queueing theory .",
    "thus , we focus on consistent simple ways for a collective ( routing ) function , theoretical and algorithmic validity , and adaptiveness for a change , which depend on the configuration and actions in cas .",
    "we consider a geographical network construction , in which the spatial distribution of nodes is naturally determined according to population in a self - organized manner .",
    "the following msq network model is generated by a self - similar tiling of faces for load balancing of communication requests in the territories of nodes .",
    "the territory is assigned by the nearest access from each user s position to a node on a geographical map .",
    "note that communication requests are usually more often generated and received at a node whose assigned population is large in the territory , and that the territories of nodes are determined by the nearest access .",
    "thus , how to locate nodes is important for balancing the communication load as even as possible .",
    "[ generation procedure of a msq network ]    step0 : : :    set an initial triangulation of any polygonal region which consists of    equilateral triangles .",
    "step1 : : :    at each time @xmath0 , a triangle face is chosen    with a probability proportional to the population in the space .",
    "step2 : : :    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_vis_msq ] , four smaller equilateral triangles are    created from the subdivision by adding three nodes , at the    intermediate point of each edge of the chosen triangle , respectively .",
    "step3 : : :    return to step 1 , while the network size ( the total number of nodes )    does not exceed a given size .",
    "since a step - by - step selection of triangle face is unnecessary in the above algorithm , the subdivision process can be initiated in a asynchronously distributed manner , e.g. according to the increase of communication requests in an individual triangle area .",
    "we will discuss why the configuration of equilateral triangles is better in the next section . on a combination of complex network science and computer science approaches ,",
    "this model has several advantages @xcite : the robustness of connectivity without vulnerable high degree nodes , the bounded short distance path between any two nodes , and the efficient decentralized routing on a planar graph which tends to be avoided from interference among wireless beams .",
    "complex network science that emerges at the beginning of the 21st century provides a new paradigm of network self - organization , e.g. based on recursive growing geometric rule for the division of a face @xcite or for the attachment which aims at a chosen edge @xcite in a random or hierarchical selection .",
    "these self - organized networks including the msq network have a potential to be superior to the vulnerable scale - free network structure found in many real network systems @xcite , such as internet , www , power - grids , airline networks , etc .",
    "we preliminarily explain some basic elements and mechanisms to realize a message - ferries routing on a planar network .",
    "figure [ fig_msq_cycle ] shows the forward direction of each edge defined by the clockwise cycles on upper triangles and the counterclockwise cycles on lower triangles . in order to reduce the number of assignment of a direction to each edge , we omit the assignment for the center faces of triangles at any layer",
    ". the layer is defined by a depth of quartered triangle faces ( or by the number of the recursive divisions ) from an initial outermost triangle .",
    "the backward direction of edge is defined in the same way by changing each of cycle to the opposite direction .",
    "we remark that a cycle is corresponded to three edges on the triangle face .",
    "moreover , these cycles represent the delivery routes of message - ferries .",
    "we consider another idea as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_another_idea ] : each triangle face is directed by only clockwise cycles . then , both forward and backward directions of an edge are assigned without counterclockwise cycles , except the edges of the outermost triangle .",
    "the better case of either fig .",
    "[ fig_msq_cycle ] or [ fig_another_idea ] depends on situations of the utilization in what type of communication resource and environment is given .",
    "we consider the autonomous distributed delivery processes after a communication request is occurred at a source node . in a store - carry - forward manner , a ferry that visits the source node @xmath1 picks up a data from @xmath1 , and carries it to the next mediator node on the routing path , which is found by a routing algorithm as mentioned later .",
    "the mediator node stores the data into its queue . here , the pickup and store times are ignored .",
    "then , any other ferry that visits the 1st mediator node picks up the data , and carries it to the 2nd mediator node .",
    "such relaying by ferries are repeated until a ferry reaches at the terminal node @xmath2 and the data is delivered .",
    "we assume that each ferry autonomously moves on a triangle cycle at a turnaround rate .",
    "several ferries exist on a cycle at random interval each other , and may have various speeds .",
    "therefore , in the random process by heterogeneous message - ferries , similar pickup and carry services are available at any time .",
    "this property of the random process rationalizes an exponential distribution of service times in the next subsection . in this routing , direct interactions between ferries at a time are not necessary , because a node act as the helper to temporarily store and forward a data asynchronously with ferry s encounters .",
    "note that our approach is categorized as multi - route and node relaying type in the ferry route design algorithms @xcite .",
    "although the message ferries act just like information frames in token ring @xcite at the date - link layer , it is quite different that the special topology of msq network generated by subdivision of equilateral triangles is focused therefore a relay of data transfers on cycles by mobile agents can be performed as a routing .",
    "since the msq networks that consist of squares and equilateral triangles belong to planner graps with the @xmath3-spanner property @xcite , we can apply an efficient adaptive face routing algorithm @xcite in order to find a shortest distance path between any two node .",
    "the spanner property means that a length of path measured by the sum of link lengths on the path as euclidean distances is bounded at most the twice of the straight line between two nodes .",
    "efficiently , the routing algorithm uses only local information about the edges of faces that intersects the straight line between source @xmath1 and terminal @xmath2 nodes , and the nodes of the faces are restricted in the ellipsoid whose chord length is defined by twice of the @xmath1-@xmath2 line as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_adaptive_face ] .",
    "we remark that the routing path can be represented by a concatenation of triangle cycles for the intersected faces with the @xmath1-@xmath2 line .",
    "if there are several shortest distance paths with a same path length between two nodes , e.g. due to symmetry , each of the paths is equally selected at random with the rate 1/(the number of the paths ) @xmath4 ( the amount of communication flows between the nodes ) .",
    "figure [ fig_detour ] shows that the routing algorithm is able to find an alternative path when some edges are disconnected , although a greedy forwarding policy based on the distance from the neighbor of a current node to the terminal node supports the path finding in the parts of removed edges and the corresponding triangle faces .",
    "the dashed piecewise linear line denotes the shortest distance path in this case , and the dotted piecewise linear line denotes the original path .",
    "thus , even with several damages for the network , the routing can be performed in a connected part before the fully destruction .",
    "in addition , the path finding is able to be performed reactively on - demand after a communication request occurs , and therefore adaptive for changes of connections .     and @xmath2 for the adaptive face routing .",
    "the chord length that consists of @xmath1-@xmath5 and @xmath5-@xmath2 is defined by the twice of @xmath1-@xmath2 line because of @xmath3-spanner.,height=245 ]          we naturally assume that the occurrence of communication request is independent random event , but the amount is proportional to a product of populations around source and terminal nodes , and that the service to transfer the request is stochastic in a multihop manner by passing through mediator nodes on a network . thus , we apply a queueing model to the communication flows as follows .    for the m / m/1 queue system @xcite as kendall notation with the arrival rate @xmath6 according to a poisson process and the service rate @xmath7 in an exponential distribution , the average number of remaining requests is @xmath8 and the average end - to - end delay is @xmath9    when we consider such stochastic processes on a network , the tandem queue model in fig .",
    "[ fig_queueing_model ] is applied .",
    "each path between source and terminal nodes ( e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig_comm_flows ] ) is decomposed into chained edges corresponded to m / m/1 queues . in the tandem queue model , from burke s theorem , these queues are independent of each other in a poisson process .",
    "then , the average end - to - end delay in a direction is given by the sum of ether @xmath10 in eq.([eq_ave_e - t - e_delay ] ) , where @xmath11 denotes the arrival rate for the sum of flows passing through an edge corresponded to the @xmath12-th cycle of message - ferry , the superscript @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the forward and the backward directions of edge , the index number @xmath15 is due to the one - to - three corresponding between a cycle and three edges of triangle . if two cycles get involved in a same direction on an edge with respect to both adjacent sides of faces , the arrival rate @xmath11 per cycle is given by ( the sum of flows)/@xmath16 .",
    "we assume @xmath17 by the symmetry of flows to simplify the discussion .",
    "the amount of flows on an edge is corresponded to the link load called as routing betweenness centrality @xcite .",
    "the service rate @xmath18 corresponds to the turnaround rate of the @xmath12-th cycle of message - ferry whose direction of clockwise or counterclockwise is determined by the coincidence with the forward direction of edge on the triangle cycle ( see fig .",

    "there are trade - off relations between the 1st & 2nd rows of the end - to - end delay and the 3rd row of the service load in eq .",
    "( [ eq_cost ] ) for minimizing the delivery cost @xmath29 .",
    "( [ eq_cost ] ) is rewritten to the sum of cycle - based components @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , are the weights obtained from the deformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq_cost ] ) .",
    "we can solve the optimal problem for minimizing the object function of eq.([eq_cost ] ) by using the newton - raphson method , since the finding at @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) results in a one - dimensional search for each variable @xmath18 or @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that the solution of @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 .",
    "thus , for minimizing the cost @xmath29 of eq.([eq_cost ] ) , it is useful that the initial value is set as @xmath52 considering the condition ( [ eq_condition ] ) .",
    "@xmath53 denotes @xmath54 .",
    "since a triangle has the minimum number of edges to form a polygonal cycle , only three variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 affect to the optimal solution of @xmath18 .",
    "if we consider the proposed scheme of message - ferries routing to any other shaped cycles with more than three edges , such as on squares , on chair or sphinx type polygons @xcite , the tuning of service rates will be more constrained than the triplets in the maximum of eq .",
    "( [ eq_initial_value ] ) for minimizing the cost @xmath29 of eq.([eq_cost ] ) .",
    "thus , the triangle cycle is the best choice . in the above discussion",
    ", the case of backward direction is similarly treated by replacing the superscript from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we have two strategies of ferry initiation and node initiation with monitoring and controlling of the system state for a recovery in local accidents .",
    "these situations are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig_recovery1 ] and [ fig_recovery2 ] . in the following ,",
    "although we explain the procedures for the clockwise cycles in the case of fig.[fig_msq_cycle ] , the same ways can be applied for the counterclockwise cycles and for the case of fig .",
    "[ fig_another_idea ] .",
    "when a white square node falls into malfunction and becomes non - interactive with a ferry , each of the related three ferries detects it in some turnarrounds , and moves to the next neighbor black circle node beyond the removed white square node , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_recovery1 ] .",
    "then , their ferries begin to move on the larger cycle .        when a ferry encounters an accident and stop the moving , the black circle nodes that detect it from non - visiting of ferry in a time - interval notify the next neighbor black square nodes to initiate the recovery process , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_recovery2 ] .",
    "each of the notified black square nodes negotiates with the moving ferries on the cycles of small triangles , then a new cycle of the larger triangle is created by changing the cyclic routes for the ferries . in deeper layers ,",
    "the recover process is similarly performed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_recovery3 ] .",
    "the gray square node in fig .",
    "[ fig_recovery3 ] detects non - visiting of ferry after changing the cyclic route , and becomes inactive .",
    "thus , if an accident occurs at a shallow layer , the procedures are hierarchically propagated to deeper layers .              on the other hand , we consider the following procedures , when new nodes are added by subdivision of triangle face in order to be a persistent living system for the growing msq network and the message - ferries routing on it . after detecting the addition of nodes by ferries , these ferries negotiate with the new nodes to move on one of the smaller cycles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_update_growth ] .",
    "such procedures can be performed at any layers of triangle faces and even simultaneously in some distant parts .",
    "the update process is used to the hierarchical recovery for a ferry s accident , when nodes work correctively .",
