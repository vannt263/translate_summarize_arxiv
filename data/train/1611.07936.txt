    "equality holds ( by a covering argument , see @xcite or @xcite ) when @xmath12 vanishes on both @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "disk components contribute to disk vectors .",
    "such an encoding can not reconstruct @xmath101 but is enough to bound from below the contribution of @xmath101 to @xmath111 , and @xmath133 is the ( normalized ) maximal number of disk components @xmath101 can have .    note that @xmath101 and @xmath102 can be glued up along inessential arcs , such that @xmath94 should be followed by @xmath95 and @xmath134 should be followed by @xmath132 .",
