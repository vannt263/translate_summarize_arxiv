    "coding has shown its power for disseminating information over networks @xcite . for wireless cooperative networks ,",
    "there are increased interests in employing the idea of network coding for improving the throughput of the network .",
    "indeed , the gain is very impressive for the special bi - directional relaying scenarios with two - way or multi - way traffic as addressed in @xcite .    for bi - directional relaying , two sources a and b want to exchange information with each other by the help of a relay node r as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : sys ] .",
    "traditionally , this can be achieved via four steps .",
    "recently , it was recognized that only two steps are essentially required with the employment of the powerful idea of physical - layer network coding ( pnc)@xcite . in particular , the superimposed signal received at the relay can be viewed as the physically - combined network coding form of the two source messages further impaired by the channel noise .",
    "hence , the so - called physical - layer network coding can be well employed to improve the throughput of bi - directional relaying .        for bi - directional relaying with pnc",
    ", it is assumed that communication takes place in two phases - a multiple access phase and a broadcast phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sys ] . in the first phase",
    ", the two source nodes send signals simultaneously to the relay . in the second phase",
    ", the relay processes the superimposed signal of the simultaneous packets and maps them to a network - coded ( xor ) packet for broadcast back to the source nodes .",
    "then , both sources can retrieve their own information as they know completely what they have sent .",
    "compared with the traditional relay system , pnc doubles the throughput of the two - way relay channel .    to be more practical ,",
    "channel coding should be employed to further improve the reliability of the system . in @xcite , joint channel decoding and physical layer network coding ( jcnc )",
    "have been introduced .",
    "it was recognized that with the same linear channel code at both source nodes , the xor of both source codewords is still a valid codeword .",
    "thus , the received signal can be decoded to the xor of the source information at the relay without changing the decoding algorithm . in @xcite , we derived the closed - form expression for computing the log - likelihood ratios ( llrs ) of the network - coded codeword for a complex multiple - access channel , and it was revealed that the equivalent channel observed at the relay is an asymmetrical channel .",
    "although this approach can be efficiently implemented , it does result in performance loss due to the use of @xmath0 while the joint probabilities @xmath1 is not fully used . in @xcite , a novel decoding scheme based on the arithmetic - sum of the source codewords",
    "was proposed for repeat - accumulate ( ra ) codes . a generalized sum - product algorithm ( g - spa ) over the galois field @xmath2 was proposed in @xcite for ldpc coded bpsk system , which can work directly with the joint probabilities @xmath1 and a significant gain was observed compared to the jcnc approach .",
    "its extension to qpsk signalling was developed in @xcite .",
    "a key issue in practical pnc is how to deal with the asynchrony between the signals transmitted by the two source nodes .",
    "that is , symbols transmitted by the two source nodes could arrive at the receiver with both symbol and frame misalignments .    in @xcite , lu et al .",
    "proposed a tanner - graph representation of the symbol - asynchronous multiple - access channel ( mac ) with rectangular - pulse shaping and also developed the message - passing algorithm for optimal decoding of asynchronous physical - layer network coding .",
    "furthermore , the message - passing algorithm was also developed when ra codes are employed .",
    "this message - passing algorithm is , in essence , the cascade of the bcjr algorithm for the asynchronous physical - layer network coding and the g - spa @xcite over the underlying tanner - graph of the specified ra code .",
    "however , its current form is in the probability - domain with channel coding restricted to the special ra codes , which is not desirable in practice .    in this paper",
    ", we provide further insights into the asynchronous bi - directional relaying . in particular , the general asynchronous mac channel with arbitrary pulse - shaping",
    "is developed and its connection to the rectangular - pulse shaping @xcite is discussed .",
    "then , the bcjr formulation of the asynchronous mac channel is proposed , which can shed lights for various practical algorithms suitable for implementation .",
    "for ldpc - coded bpsk signalling over the symbol - asynchronous mac , we present a formal log - domain generalized sum - product - algorithm ( log - g - spa ) for efficient decoding .",
    "furthermore , we propose to use cyclic codes for combating the frame - asynchronism and its related problem of delay resolution is discussed in detail .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section - ii , a general channel model for asynchronous physical - layer network coding is developed .",

    "[ fig:2 ] that the log - g - spa performs significantly better than the jcnc , and its robustness to @xmath206 is also observed with symbol - asynchronism compared to the jcnc @xcite . for the jcnc decoding ,",

    "[ fig:3 ]    finally , we investigate the effect of both frame and symbol misalignments on the system performance .",
    "hence , the cyclic ldpc code is employed and the maximum number of iterations are set to @xmath207 . for frame misalignment , @xmath155 is assumed to be randomly picked from @xmath208 $ ] . the ber performance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for the normalized equal - power complex mac channel with @xmath205 .",
    "as shown , the performance degradation due to the frame misalignment is less than 0.2 db in this case .",
    "if the mechanism of ( [ eq : fr ] ) is incorporated , the performance gap can be further narrowed but the complexity must be increased to about @xmath209 times of the original algorithm . to resolve the relative delay @xmath155 ,",
    "the crc-16 is appended to the source message of length @xmath210 for both sources a and b. in simulations , the resolution process is only initiated when the parity - checks of both ldpc codes are satisfied , i.e. , the error - free case .",
    "we found that the resolution process always works and the correct value of @xmath155 can be found once the parity - checks of ldpc codes are satified .",
    "we have presented a general channel model for the asynchronous multiple - access channel with arbitrary pulse - shaping , typically encountered in bi - directional relaying . by evoking the wmf technique",
    ", one can arrive at an equivalent vector isi channel , which can be employed to develop the well - known bcjr algorithm for getting the optimal apps .",
    "we also present a formal log - g - spa decoding for the ldpc coded bpsk signalling over asynchronous macs . to further combat the frame asynchronism ,",
    "the cyclic ldpc codes , along with the crc techniques , are proposed .",
    "various proposed techniques can be well employed to overcome the asynchronism of the bi - directional relaying .",
    "there are several issues to be explored in future . for either continuous or burst transmission of ldpc frames",
    ", the proposed methods can only work with limited misalignment in frames , i.e. , a small value of @xmath155 relative to the codeword length .",
    "this method generally requires to some control mechanism for cooperative transmission between sources a and b. if no control mechanism is required , one must seriously consider the case of large values of @xmath155 . for this case , one have to base several ldpc frames for decoding and the interference cancelation technique",
    "can be helpful for successful decoding and correct resolution of unknown delay .",
    "the log - g - spa decoding has shown its performance advantage if both sources a and b employ the same ldpc code .",
    "however , it remains unknown how to design ldpc codes for maximizing the system performance with either synchronous or asynchronous multiple - access channels .",
    "furthermore , compared to the log - spa decoding of non - binary ldpc codes , the complexity of log - g - spa decoding for ldpc coded transmission over macs is somewhat lower since the permutation step is not required",
    ". however , there are more work to do for its practical implementation .",
