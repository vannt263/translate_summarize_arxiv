    "sunspot umbrae are quasi - stable structures that can be considered to be in nearly magnetohydrostatic ( mhs ) equilibrium due to their long lifetimes relative to the dynamical timescale of the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "hale s historic observation of the zeeman effect in sunspots revealed them as concentrations of strong magnetic fields @xcite , and biermann and alfvn provided us with the first physically plausible explanation of the sunspot phenomenon @xcite . although the sunspot atmosphere is cool and has a low degree of ionization , its conductivity is high , and it can be assumed that the magnetic field is `` frozen in '' to the gas . in alfvn",
    "s theory the strong magnetic field suppresses the convective heating of the interior of the sunspot .",
    "it also supports the cool sunspot interior against the higher pressure of the hotter surrounding quiet sun @xcite . for a sunspot with circular symmetry",
    "the mhs equilibrium state at any radius from the center of the sunspot ( @xmath1 ) and height ( @xmath2 ) in the sunspot atmosphere can be written as : @xmath3 for c.g.s .",
    "units , where @xmath4 is the gas pressure in the quiet sun , and the pressure in the sunspot is given by the product of the number density of the gas ( @xmath5 ) , boltzmann s constant ( @xmath6 ) , and temperature ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the magnetic field contributes a pressure term from the vertical component of the field ( @xmath8 ) and a tension or curvature term ( @xmath9 ) which is given by : @xmath10 where the integral runs from the radius in question to the maximum radius of the sunspot ( @xmath11 ) , and requires knowledge of the vertical gradient of the radial component of the magnetic field ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "although this theory provides us with a basic description of the mhs equilibrium condition for sunspots , observational tests are difficult to carry out , even for the form of circular symmetry assumed in equation [ eqn1 ] . because of radiative transfer ( rt ) effects , the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a sunspot observed in regions of different temperature do not originate at the same geometrical depth in the sunspot atmosphere , and information about the vertical structure can not be derived easily . therefore the contribution of the curvature force term , which requires knowledge of the vertical gradient of the magnetic field , can not be determined directly from observations . nevertheless , under the restrictive conditions present in the sunspot umbra it is possible to make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "here the magnetic fields are mostly vertical and the contribution from the curvature force term is expected to be small . in addition , the radial gradient of temperature is small , and the magnetic field and temperature observations can be considered to originate at a single height . therefore ,",
    "if we make the assumptions that sunspots are vertical magnetic flux tubes with constant magnetic field strength , and have an ideal gas atmosphere with constant density and height , then equation [ eqn1 ] can be simplified to the thermal - magnetic relation : @xmath13     vs @xmath14 relation from noaa 11130 observed with firs on december 2 , 2010 displaying an isothermal increase in the umbral magnetic field .",
    "points selected from the penumbra are shown in gold ( + ) and points from the umbra are black ( @xmath15 ) . ]",
    "although equation [ eqn3 ] is elegantly simple it has not been verified observationally .",
    "while some examples of the empirical relation between @xmath16 and @xmath14 determined from sunspots are best described by a linear relationship @xcite , the majority of modern observations show that @xmath16 can be a highly non - linear function of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] gives an example of the thermal - magnetic relation for the main sunspot in noaa 11130 that we have recently derived from spectropolarimetric observations at 15650  , where temperature has been determined from the continuum contrast , and magnetic field was obtained by milne - eddington inversion of the line pair .",
    "the non - linearities in the @xmath16 vs. @xmath14 relation are evident : the sunspot shows an unexpected sharp increase in magnetic field strength at relatively constant temperature in the darkest part of the umbra .",
    "this result is puzzling . with the simplifying assumptions leading to equation [ eqn3 ] ,",
    "figure [ fig1 ] implies the existence of a heretofore unidentified mechanism at work in the coolest regions that reduces the thermal pressure of the sunspot atmosphere to accommodate the higher magnetic pressure in these regions .",
    "in deriving equation [ eqn3 ] we have made the assumptions that : 1 ) sunspot magnetic fields are near vertical with respect to the local solar surface and that the curvature force has a negligible effect on the force balance of a sunspot , 2 ) the geometrical depth of the @xmath17 level depends roughly on the temperature @xmath14 , and that the temperature and magnetic field observed in a sunspot originates from roughly the same height in the sunspot atmosphere , and 3 ) the density of the solar atmosphere is a constant that does not change with temperature . in assuming a flux tube model",
    ", we also neglect fine structure , flows , growth , decay , and other evolutionary effects .",
    "while the first two assumptions are difficult to verify due to radiative transfer effects , they may be justified under restrictive conditions such as those encountered in the sunspot umbra . on the other hand ,",
    "the third assumption of constant density is obviously not warranted , especially under the temperature regime encountered in the umbral photosphere .    at an effective temperature of 5,750 k",
    "the quiet sun photosphere is largely neutral and already harbors many heavy - element molecular species with high dissociation energies @xcite . at even lower temperatures in the sunspot",
    "umbra many more molecular species , in particular molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , are able to form .",
    "because the abundances of heavy elements in the solar photosphere are very low compared to hydrogen , the number of molecules formed containing heavy elements is correspondingly low with respect to the total particle number density , therefore the formation of heavy element molecules can not have a significant effect on the thermodynamic properties of the solar atmosphere .",
    "however , in the umbra the atmosphere is very cool , making it possible to form a substantial fraction of h@xmath0 .",
    "observations of the fluorescent h@xmath0  lines in the ultraviolet have confirmed its presence in the chromosphere above sunspots @xcite , while atmospheric models of the sunspot umbra predict a molecular hydrogen population of up to @xmath18 , peaking near the height of continuum formation @xcite .",

    "for example , as free atoms combine into molecules the dissociation energy is released .",
    "this may increase the local thermal energy content of the atmosphere if it can not be dissipated rapidly enough . on the other hand ,",
    "molecules have the ability to store energy in rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the thermal signature of the gas , resulting in an increased heat capacity .",
    "therefore if a significant fraction of the hydrogen atoms in the photosphere of a sunspot exist in molecular form , then the thermodynamic properties of the sunspot will be significantly different from that of the quiet sun photosphere .",
    "finally , the combination of free atoms into molecules decreases the total particle number density and pressure of the gas .",
    "this effect is of particular importance to the problem of mhs equilibrium in sunspots since it provides a mechanism for changing the gas pressure of the sunspot atmosphere without a corresponding change in the temperature , which may explain the isothermal intensification of the magnetic field strength in the darkest regions of the sunspot seen in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "even a small alteration in the balance of gas pressures in a sunspot may translate into large changes in the sunspot magnetic field .",
    "given the critical role that h@xmath0  may potentially play in the physics of sunspots , it is the objective of this study to determine if a significant fraction of h@xmath0  exists in the photosphere of sunspots .",
    "we will also demonstrate that h@xmath0  formation occurs at a temperature coinciding with the sharp rise of @xmath16 seen in figure [ fig1 ] to support the argument that this feature is due to the formation of h@xmath0 .      to establish the existence of h@xmath0  in the sunspot photosphere and its link with the isothermal intensification of the umbral magnetic fields , it is necessary to characterize the 2d magnetic field , temperature , and h@xmath0  fraction of many sunspots at different stages of evolution . in previous investigations , the authors presented the thermal - magnetic relation from a single sunspot observation , or from observations of many sunspots with very limited spatial resolution . to fully explore the relationship between temperature and magnetic field strength , we have conducted a comprehensive survey of sunspots , obtaining high spectral and spatial resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the infrared line pair at 15650  .",
    "the instrumentation and observational setup , as well as the dataset , are described in  [ sec_obs ] .",
    "the reduction of the data , including the treatment of scattered light and the measurement and calibration of the telescope and instrumental polarization crosstalk , will be described in  [ sec_data_reduction ] and [ sec_pol_cor ] .",
    "we have derived the vector magnetic field configuration of the sunspots using a milne - eddington inversion code (  [ sec_inversion ] ) .    due to the highly forbidden nature of the infrared ro - vibrational transitions of h@xmath0  in the solar atmosphere , and the current lack of space - based instruments to provide spectral coverage of the fluorescent emission lines in the uv ,",
    "direct measurement of the abundance of h@xmath0abundance in the photosphere lies beyond our grasp",
    ". nevertheless , since the formation of the molecules is directly controlled by the temperature of the gas , it is possible to infer the photospheric h@xmath0  abundance from proxy measurements of other similar molecules .",
    "the dissociation energy of the h@xmath0  molecule ( 4.48 ev ) is very similar to the dissociation energy of the hydroxide ( oh ) molecule ( 4.39 ev ) which exhibits strong absorption features throughout the visible and ir sunspot spectrum .",
    "serendipitously , it has strong absorption lines inside the spectral window of the line pair at 15650   used for the measurement of sunspot magnetic fields .",

    "the full survey will be presented and discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "the horizontal spectrograph ( hsg ) is a versatile and reconfigurable 3 m spectrograph arm with multiple available gratings .",
    "it consists of an adjustable rectangular slit , collimator lens , plane grating , camera lens , and detector .",
    "the experimental hsg setup for these sunspot observations was similar to those described in @xcite and @xcite . during the 2001 observations a @xmath23 hgcdte nicmos 3",

    "firs is a new facility instrument for the dst recently completed by the institute for astronomy at the university of hawaii ( p.i .",

    "several unique design elements allow firs to perform full - stokes vector spectropolarimetry at two wavelengths simultaneously in the visible and infrared , at 6302 and 10830   or 6302 and 15650  .",

    "diffraction - limited performance at 6302   can be achieved with firs using the dst s high order adaptive optics ( hoao ) system @xcite , which also provides excellent image correction at infrared wavelengths even in mediocre seeing conditions .",
    "separate liquid crystal variable retarders for each wavelength modulate the polarization in an efficiency - balanced scheme which is analyzed and split into two orthogonally polarized beams by a wollaston prism which allows the spurious seeing effects to be eliminated in post - processing .",
    "a more detailed description of the instrument can be found in @xcite and soon in lin et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the observations from firs were processed using the idl reduction tools ( http://kopiko.ifa.hawaii.edu/firs/ ) which corrected for the infrared detector non - linearity , subtracted darks , and demodulated the raw polarization states to retrieve the stokes vector .",
    "a flat field was produced by fitting and removing absorption lines from spatially averaged quiet sun observations and was applied to stokes i to remove intensity variations due to the detector , slit , narrow - band filter , and other elements in the optical system .",
    "the demodulation scheme for the stokes vector effectively removes response variation under the assumption that the filter profile is flat over the spectral window .",
    "the spectra from each slit were corrected for spectral curvature and drift , the orthogonally polarized beams were combined , and the spectra were stacked into a data cube . following the reduction the data cubes were cropped spatially to a relevant area around each sunspot .",
    "observations from the hsg were reduced in a similar fashion to the firs observations ( details in @xcite and @xcite ) , however no correction was applied to compensate for the detector linearity .",
    "the stokes q , u , and v spectra were corrected for instrumental polarization cross - talk using the method of @xcite .",
    "this approach rather simply assumes that the stokes q and u profiles should be symmetric about the line center and stokes v should be anti - symmetric . from this assumption",
    "the cross - talk coefficients are determined from a small portion of the spectrum and applied to the full data cube .",
    "based on these assumptions , one would think that the kuhn method might not work well for physical situations which produce non- symmetric and anti - symmetric stokes profiles .",
    "therefore , we have verified the appropriateness of the kuhn method , and the data quality in general , by comparing corrected firs observations to reduced spectra from the hinode solar optical telescope spectropolarimeter ( sot / sp ) which were closely coincident in time ( about 4 minutes apart ) .",
    "the polarization cross - talk in the sot / sp has been very carefully measured and corrected as described by @xcite .",
    "the maps and example spectra from each observation are shown in figure [ fig2 ] , and in figure [ fig3 ] we show a point - by - point comparison of all quiet sun and sunspot spatial and spectral positions from the aligned datacubes of stokes spectra from firs and the sot / sp . most predominantly noticeable is the effect of seeing on the observations .",
    "small scale features with extreme intensity , velocity , or polarization signatures are smoothed over in the firs spectrum , such as the upper line spectrum in figure [ fig2 ] which is from a position in the light bridge . however , the overall behavior of the spectra is similar , and non - symmetric profiles seen in the hinode data are faithfully reproduced by firs . in the scatter plots the overall adherence to the 1:1 line ( esp . at low signal levels in stokes",
    "i ) is encouraging .",
    "the flattening of stokes q , u , and v in figure [ fig3 ] indicates that the highest polarization signals seen by hinode are not detected by firs , these signals are spatially discrete and become smoothed over by seeing .",
    "the high q and u values in the hinode data where corresponding firs values are zero , are the result of a bad scan - step on the penumbral / quiet sun boundary in the sot / sp scan .",
    "we have developed a milne - eddington inversion code , called the two - component magneto - optical ( 2cmo ) inversion code , based on the formalism of @xcite for the inference of the vector magnetic field configuration from our data .",
    "this code models the observed stokes spectra with a magnetic and a non - magnetic atmospheric component , fully accounting for magneto - optical effects .",
    "voigt and faraday - voigt functions are used for the synthesis of the line profiles , while gaussian profiles are used for fitting the oh lines .",
    "the 2cmo inversion code is capable of simultaneously fitting of multiple spectral lines with different land @xmath28 factors , such as the line pairs of the 630 nm and 1565 nm lines , to achieve higher magnetic field strength sensitivity in the weak - field regime @xcite .",
    "the magnetic component in 2cmo is described by ten parameters : magnetic filling fraction ( @xmath29 ) , magnetic field strength ( @xmath30 ) , inclination ( @xmath31 ) , azimuth ( @xmath32 ) , source function ( @xmath33 ) , source function gradient ( @xmath34 ) , line center ( @xmath35 ) , doppler width ( @xmath36 ) , damping parameter ( @xmath11 ) , and the ratio of line to continuum absorption ( @xmath37 ) . by assuming @xmath37 has the same behavior between the two lines the number of fitted parameters",
    "can be decreased .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is scaled for the atomic lines by a constant factor of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the degeneracy of the lower level , @xmath29 is the oscillator strength , @xmath40 is the energy of the lower level for the transition , and t is the temperature ( we assume an average temperature at the height of line formation of 5000 k ) .",
    "the line values @xmath41 and @xmath28 for the lines were taken from @xcite .",
    "the oh lines are very weak in regions warmer than the sunspot umbra , and are therefore susceptible to stray light in much the same way as the atomic lines . in addition , the oh lines experience the molecular zeeman effect @xcite which produces non - negligible stokes v signal at umbral magnetic field strengths . in order to accurately fit the stokes v profiles during the inversion , and",
    "properly account for the stray light contamination for the oh lines , they must be included in the magnetic component .",
    "the oh lines are assumed to be influenced by the same magnetic field as the atomic lines , however the gaussian width and depth of the oh lines are left as independent parameters .",
    "a non - magnetic component is included to account for stray light from the instrumental system and unresolved mixing of adjacent magnetic and non - magnetic regions .",
    "it is assumed the non - magnetic fill fraction is @xmath42 .",
    "a stray light profile is generated from averaged quiet sun intensity profiles and is allowed to shift in wavelength ( @xmath43 ) , adding one additional free parameter .        to confirm the validity of the solutions from our inversion code ,",
    "we have conducted a comparison of the results from 2cmo and those from the milne - eddington grid linear inversion network ( merlin ) from the community spectropolarimetric analysis center ( csac ) at the national center for atmospheric research .",
    "merlin is a new implementation of the original me code written by @xcite @xcite .",
    "merlin fits the same set of parameters as our code , and although the subtleties of the implementation , initialization , and calculation are different , the two codes describe the same physics and should produce similar results when performed on identical data .    as an example we have obtained merlin results from the csac inversion client for a 6302   observation of the sunspot in noaa 11024 taken on 2009 july 7 by the solar optical telescope spectro - polarimeter onboard the hinode spacecraft , and preformed a 2cmo inversion on the same dataset . in figure [ fig4 ] we show the observed stokes profiles from a single position in the sunspot umbra ( black ) , the fitted profiles from 2cmo ( red ) and merlin ( blue ) , and the data - fit residuals .",
    "the synthetic profiles show slight differences due to the choice of line parameters , however the quality of fitting shown by the data - fit residuals is comparable . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the scatter - plot comparison of the magnetic field parameters from merlin and 2cmo for all inverted positions .",
    "the two codes produce largely the same magnetic field strength in the umbra to 70 g ( rms ) .",
    "the increased scatter in magnetic field strength at low values demonstrates the degeneracy with the magnetic filling factor in regimes where the line is not completely split .",
    "however , the scatter in the filling factor is larger than we might expect based on this degeneracy alone , and in general larger values of the filling factor are produced by merlin .",
    "while the parameter sets are identical between the two codes , the implementation is different , in particular the treatment of scattered light and the tolerances placed on the stokes i fit can significantly alter the resulting fill factor .",
    "the 2cmo inversion code and the results from the comparison are described further in @xcite .",
    "stray light is one of the largest sources of error in temperature and magnetic field measurements in sunspots .",
    "detailed discussions of the effects of stray light and its correction have been carried out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in general , stray light results in reduced contrast of the continuum with respect to the quiet sun , the contamination of sunspot intensity profiles with a stray quiet sun component , and reduced amplitudes of the polarized components .",
    "the correction of stray light is particularly important for the accurate determination of quantities which depend on intensity , such as temperature and the equivalent width of spectral lines .",
    "m respectively . ]",
    "spatial stray light may arise from both atmospheric and instrumental scattered light . without proper characterization of the instrumental and atmospheric contribution to spatial stray light",
    ", the fraction due to the instrument and telescope can not be distinguished from the unresolved mixing of adjacent magnetic and non - magnetic regions .",
    "the degeneracy of magnetic field strength and its filling fraction in weak field regimes is an additional source of ambiguity for the estimation of the stray light somponent .",
    "therefore the filling fraction determined by the inversion can only place an upper limit on the spatial stray light .",
    "detailed measurements to determine the stray light for firs have not been carried out .",
    "however , in observations at the solar limb ( shown in figure [ fig6 ] ) the stray fraction at 0.02 r@xmath44 or about 20 \" above the limb is approximately 3% and 5% of the disk center brightness in the visible and infrared ( or about 8% of the intensity at the limb ) .",
    "this measurement agrees with the filling fraction determined in the umbra of very large sunspots , where the photosphere should be almost entirely magnetic .",
    "therefore we apply the inverted magnetic filling fraction to correct the spatial stray light in the intensity spectrum .",
    "there is no line - free source of spatial stray light , therefore any spectral stray light must arise only following the slit of the instrument .",
    "it is possible to estimate the spectral stray light by measuring the equivalent width of spectral lines and comparing them to a pristine measurement free of spectral stray light .",
    "the presence of a possible large spectral stray fraction in firs and its effect on the measurement of equivalent widths is discussed further in  [ sec_oh ] .",
    "the direct measurement of h@xmath0  at photospheric heights is infeasible for the reasons described in  [ sec_meth ] .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to establish the h@xmath0  abundance through indirect methods .",

    "it is necessary to use multiple heliocentric angles to determine the correct relation between the equivalent width of the 15651.9   oh line and h@xmath0 . because the height of @xmath17 changes as a function of heliocentric angle , the oh line strength , intensity ratios , and atmospheric parameters for sunspots at significantly different positions on the solar disk can not be compared directly . to make use of observations at obtained over a large range of heliocentric angles we must apply a correction based on the atmospheric models . for the heliocentric angle of each sunspot observation we determine the relation of the intensity and oh equivalent width at the heliocentric angle to the equivalent disk center continuum temperature and h@xmath0  fraction respectively . in this way data from a wide range of angles",
    "can be compared directly .",
    "we have chosen to use the 15651.9   oh line which is stronger than the blend at 15651.0  , and less affected by the zeeman split g=1.7 line than the 15653.4   line .",

    "if we assume a model where the stray light level at any given position is constant fraction of the quiet sun continuum ( @xmath50 , e.g. from uniform scattered or parasitic light ) , then the corrected equivalent width would be increased , but the continuum contrast would also be increased , and the resulting relation would move up and to the left in figure [ fig11 ] . however ,",
    "if we assume that the stray fraction at any given position is proportional to the continuum intensity at that position ( @xmath51 , e.g. from overlapping orders ) , then the equivalent width increases by a multiple of the stray fraction , but the continuum contrast is preserved .    if there were a large fraction of spectral stray light it should affect the iron lines in the same way .",

    "the pores in noaa 11049 show strictly linear behavior , indicating that for the case of small pores , the magnetic field is too weak and the temperature too high to have a significant h@xmath0  fraction , which is confirmed by the undetected oh lines .    a very intriguing result of this survey is the b@xmath27 vs. t curve of the large spot of noaa 11131 that is distinctly different from those of the rest of the sample .",
    "it follows an elevated track in b@xmath27 vs. t without the signature of isothermal magnetic field intensification at t = 5,800 k. similar results are found in the other large sunspots in the sample .",
    "our survey and analysis provide observational evidence that significant h@xmath0  molecule formation is present in sunspots that are able to maintain maximum fields of greater than 2,500 g. measurements of the oh equivalent width seen in sunspot umbrae are qualitatively consistent with the predictions from spectra synthesized by radiative transfer models .",
    "we infer a molecular gas fraction of a few percent h@xmath0  in the largest sunspots .",
    "the formation of this small faction appears to alter the equilibrium of pressures in the sunspot isothermally , resulting in an increase of the slope of the thermal - magnetic relation at temperatures lower than a 15650   continuum brightness temperature of 6,000 k where the h@xmath0  fraction begins to rapidly increase with temperature .",
    "we suggest that the formation of h@xmath0  molecules in the sunspot umbra causes a rapid intensification of the magnetic field without a significant decrease in temperature which would explain the increase in slope of the thermal - magnetic relation .",
    "we hypothesize that h@xmath0  plays an important role in the formation and evolution of sunspots . during the initial stage of sunspot emergence and cooling",
    ", the formation of h@xmath0  may trigger a temporary `` runaway '' magnetic field intensification process .",
    "as magnetic flux emerges and strengthens , the sunspot atmosphere cools due to the suppression of convective heating by the magnetic field .",
    "when sufficiently low temperatures are reached h@xmath0  begins to form in substantial numbers in the coolest parts of the umbra .",
    "as free hydrogen atoms combine to form h@xmath0 , the total particle number density is reduced . the dissociation energy released into the atmosphere",
    "is rapidly dissipated by radiative cooling due to the low opacity of the photosphere , reducing the total kinetic pressure without a corresponding reduction in temperature .",
    "the decrease in gas pressure causes this region to shrink in size , and due to the high electrical conductivity of the atmosphere the magnetic fields are compressed with the plasma ( the `` frozen - in field '' effect ) .",
    "the resulting higher magnetic field density further inhibits the convective heating of the sunspot atmosphere , which leads to further cooling .",
    "this `` runaway '' magnetic field intensification process is most likely a temporary phenomenon which is arrested long before all the hydrogen atoms have condensed into molecular form . at some point",
    "the transport of energy by convection will be effectively quenched and increases in magnetic field will no longer result in decreases in temperature . the transfer of radiative energy from surrounding hotter regions would also keep the umbra from becoming excessively cool .",
    "therefore further h@xmath0  formation would be halted .",
    "while the formation of h@xmath0  may initiate a more rapid intensification of the sunspot magnetic field during sunspot emergence , we speculate that during the decay phase in a sunspot which has already formed a substantial h@xmath0  population , the highest concentrations of molecular gas would tend to maintain the magnetic field against decay and extend the lifetime of the sunspot .",
    "as the magnetic field in a sunspot weakens , regions of the umbra once cool become warm and h@xmath0  dissociates back into atomic hydrogen .",
    "the more rapid increase in pressure in warmer regions of the umbra would compress the remaining cool regions , concentrating the magnetic field and maintaining the cool interior against convective heating .",
    "the formation of h@xmath0  would speed up the process of sunspot emergence , and the dissociation of h@xmath0  would slow down their disappearance . while the effects of the formation and destruction of molecules would produce similar signatures in the thermal - magnetic relation , we would expect to see more cases of sunspots in the decay phase due to observational bias .",
    "there is evidence that the intensification of the magnetic field occurs in discrete cores , such as can been seen in noaa 9429 , which is consistent with this speculative picture of molecule formation during the growth and decay of sunspots .",
    "if this is the case the molecular fraction would be significantly underestimated in sunspots due to the effect of filling factor , and may exist in quantities of 5% in unresolved features , consistent with the coolest models of the umbra such as those presented in @xcite .",
    "it is possible that two other effects contribute to the non - linearity of the thermal - magnetic relation . in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the non - linearity of the thermal - magnetic relation was interpreted as a radiative transfer effect , i.e. the wilson depression effect in sunspots .",
    "cooler atmospheres in a sunspot are more optically thin , therefore the magnetic field and continuum measurements originate from a greater geometrical depth . in seeing deeper into the atmosphere",
    "we are able to see relatively hotter regions , therefore the observed temperature would seem to decrease less rapidly ( relative to radius or b ) than in a single geometrical layer . this effect would therefore tend to increase the slope of the thermal - magnetic relation , however the temperature should still decrease as the magnetic field strength increases .    through all of this work",
    "we have also neglected the curvature force . increased contributions to the horizontal support from the curvature force in outlying regions",
    "may cause the magnetic pressure in the sunspot core to seem boosted , contributing to the non - linearity of the thermal - magnetic relation .",
    "detailed modeling efforts are necessary to determine the validity of the proposed scenarios for h@xmath0  formation and destruction during the emergence and decay of sunspots , and contribution of the radiative transfer effect and the curvature force to the non - linearity of the thermal - magnetic relation .",
    "we intend to more carefully consider the effects of the curvature force and the wilson depression and further investigate the problem of h@xmath0  formation using the simultaneous dual - height observations obtained with the 6302 and 15650   channels of firs to perform a detailed comparison with recent mhd sunspot models from @xcite .    particularly for the cases of isothermal intensification of the magnetic field in noaa 9429 and 11130 ,",
    "it is unlikely that such a sharp upturn in the slope can be explained simply through radiative phenomenon or the curvature force .",
    "the formation of h@xmath0  appears to be the most likely cause of the sharp increase in slope of the thermal - magnetic relation in sunspots .",
    "in addition to this magnetic intensification process , the formation of molecules increases the heat capacity of the sunspot atmosphere . due to the additional degrees of freedom of the h@xmath0  molecule",
    ", the formation of a h@xmath0  fraction of 10% would ideally raise the heat capacity of the gas by 13% over an equivalent number density of atomic gas .",
    "this non - thermal reservoir for energy may have an important effect on the local radiative output of the sun .",
    "consequently , we suggest that modeling of the mhs equilibrium condition of sunspots in the form of equation [ eqn1 ] must include a multiple - component atmospheric model with the proper equation of state to account for the altered thermodynamics of the sunspot atmosphere due to the formation of h@xmath0 .",
    "our sample was obtained sporadically through the minimum phase of solar cycle 23 and does not contain very large sunspots with high magnetic field strengths .",
    "an intriguing and unexpected finding is the distinctly different behavior of the b@xmath27 vs. t curve of the largest sunspots in the survey ( e.g. , noaa 11131 ) .",
    "while we can not provide a definitive explanation at this point , we point out that equation 1 describes only the mhs equilibrium condition for sunspots , and sunspots can not be in perfect mhs equilibrium all the time ( in such case sunspots would be static without possibility of evolution ) .",
    "therefore we should not expect that the b@xmath27 vs. t curves to represent the equilibrium state , or that they follow the same track .",
    "we suspect that differences in the observed behavior of the b@xmath27 vs. t curves are the manifestation of changing magnetic and thermal environment of sunspots at different stages of their evolution . a continued observational effort following sunspots through their lifecycle",
    "should provide the necessary data to address this issue as solar cycle 24 enters its maximum phase and larger sunspots start to appear .",
