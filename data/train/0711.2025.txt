    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to the generation of two - photon states with specific spectral properties in bulk materials .",
    "entangled two - photon states with coincident frequencies have been obtained using extended phase - matching conditions , i.e. assuming group - velocity phase matching on the top of the usual phase matching @xcite .",
    "such states have perfect visibility in the usual interferometric setups and moreover allow a very precise clock synchronization @xcite .",
    "spectrally uncorrelated two - photon states have also been studied extensively because they seem to be extraordinarily useful for linear quantum computation that needs indistinguishable photons with a perfect time synchronization @xcite .",
