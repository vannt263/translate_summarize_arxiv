    "the insightful prediction of baade & zwicky ( 1934 ) that neutron stars are produced during core - collapse supernovae gained significant observational credence in 1968 with the discovery of young , rapidly - rotating radio pulsars in the crab and vela supernova remnants ( staelin & reifenstein 1968 ; large , vaughan & mills 1968 ) .",

    "the rarity of young pulsars means that the first ones to be discovered will likely be luminous .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",

    "whether this plot shows evidence for luminosity decay with age is debatable .",
    "although some luminosity decay might be expected a - priori ( for example if the magnetic field decays ; fig .",
    "[ fig:1983]b ) , a dangerous conclusion to draw from this plot is that young pulsars are necessarily bright objects .",
    "recent discoveries show that this conclusion is incorrect .",
    "luminous young pulsars are the exception rather than the rule .",

    "tabulate 52 examples of associations between young neutron stars and supernova remnants .",
    "the fact that radio pulsations have been detected in only 18 ( 35% ) of the neutron stars so far highlights the importance of observations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum to obtain a true picture of the population .",
    "issues such as the pulsar birth rate , the supernova rate , the fraction of supernovae that produce a neutron star , the radio pulsar beaming fraction , the birth properties of pulsars ( luminosities , periods , velocities etc . ) and the subsequent spindown evolution ( magnetic field decay , braking index evolution etc . )",
    "can all be constrained by studying a statistically significant sample of young objects .",
    "this review looks at the astonishing progress in this field in the last few years which has provided many insights into this traditionally elusive part of the compact - object population .",
    "the two main ways to find young pulsars are blind surveys and targeted searches . in a blind survey , the aim is to cover a large area of sky with good sensitivity with a reasonable investment of telescope time and manpower .",
    "the optimum region to find young pulsars is close to the galactic plane where their progenitors ( the massive o and b stars ) are known to lie .",
    "in addition , supernova remnants and gamma - ray sources likely to be associated with the pulsar population are also found along the galactic plane .    by far the most successful project of this kind",
    "has been the parkes multibeam ( pm ) survey of the galactic plane which has so far discovered over 600 pulsars ( manchester et al .",
    "2001 ; morris et al .  2002 ; kramer et al .",
    "the pm survey is about seven times more sensitive than any previous galactic plane search and , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pksmb ] , has been particularly efficient at finding young objects in the inner galaxy .    in a targeted survey ,",
    "the aim is to carry out the deepest searches possible for radio pulsations by choosing well - motivated specific directions in the galaxy . for young pulsars ,",
    "the obvious regions of interest are supernova remnants and unidentified gamma - ray sources . in the past , despite considerable effort , this approach was not very fruitful ( e.g.  kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ; nice & sayer 1997 ; lorimer et al .",
    "the main obstacle is the fact that most targets can not be covered by a single telescope beam ( typically several arcminutes in extent ) .",
    "since there is often extreme competition for telescope time , searches requiring a number of separate pointings are necessarily compromised in sensitivity by the need to reduce the integration time to cover the target area .",
    "targeted searches are now enjoying something of a renaissance with the advent of new high - energy telescopes , such as _ chandra_. the spatial resolution of the new instruments has resulted in arcsecond localisation of neutron star candidates in a number of supernova remnants .",
    "armed with this information , and state - of - the art receivers and data acquisition systems , observers at radio telescopes have been able to carry out very deep single - pointing integrations ( often complete rise - to - set transits ) of the high - energy point sources , which has resulted in a dramatic leap in sensitivity .",
    "before moving onto the recent discoveries , let us summarise what can be inferred about pulsar ages by studying their spindown .",
    "timing measurements readily yield precise measurements of the pulsar rotation frequency @xmath7 and its time derivative , @xmath8 .",
    "both these quantities provide insights into the age and spin history of the neutron star . expressing the spindown torque in general terms , we have @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the so - called braking index . integrating this expression , for constant @xmath10 ,",
    "gives the pulsar age @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the spin period at birth . under the assumptions @xmath13 ( spindown due to pure magnetic dipole radiation ) and @xmath14",
    ", this expression reduces to @xmath15 , i.e.  the characteristic age , @xmath16 , defined earlier .",
    "the young pulsar sample provides a means to investigate the validity of the above assumptions a stage further . to date , for five pulsars , the high spindown rates allow measurement of @xmath17 which leads to a direct determination of the braking index : @xmath18 . for these pulsars ,",
    "braking indices are in the range @xmath19 , all below the expected value for pure magnetic dipole radiation ( @xmath13 ) . for pulsars where",
    "an independent constraint on @xmath20 can be obtained ( e.g.  from a convincing association with a supernova remnant of known age ) , we may invert the above expression to constrain the initial spin period . for example , for the crab pulsar , where @xmath10 and @xmath20 are known ,",
    "we find @xmath21 ms .",
    "we shall discuss current constraints on @xmath10 and @xmath12 available from the newly discovered pulsars in the following sections .",
    "obtaining reliable measurements of @xmath10 is non - trivial , since it requires a careful treatment of the contaminating effects of so - called `` timing noise '' prominent in young pulsars .",
    "nevertheless , timing observations currently underway have the potential to yield new measurements of braking indices in the future .",
    "psr  j11196127 is a 407-ms pulsar discovered in the pm survey ( camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) . with @xmath22 , currently the largest known among radio pulsars , the characteristic age for this pulsar @xmath23 kyr",
    ". the extremely high rate of spindown permitted a significant measurement of @xmath24 and hence a braking index of @xmath25 .",
    "inserting these parameters into equation ( [ equ : age ] ) for any assumed value of @xmath12 implies an upper limit on the age of this pulsar of only 1.7 kyr  very similar to that of the crab , b150958 and b054069 , all of which are associated with supernova remnants .",
    "although no catalogued remnant was known at this position , a faint shell was seen in the molonglo 843-mhz survey ( green et al .",

    "argue the age of the supernova remnant to be less than 3 kyr .",
    "another pointer to the youth and validity of the association is the very small offset ( @xmath26 ) of the pulsar from the geometric centre of the remnant .",
    "this is extremely unlikely to occur in a chance alignment , especially with such a young pulsar , and implies that the transverse velocity of j11196127 is less than 500 km s@xmath27 .",
    "a final constraint on the pulsar parameters comes from the lack of a detection of a radio pulsar wind nebula , as is also the case in the energetic pulsar b150958 ( bhattacharya 1990 ) . extending bhattacharya s model to predict the brightness of a nebula around j11196127 , crawford et al .",
    "show that the lack of detection is consistent with an initial spin period @xmath28 ms .",
    "a distance estimate to both the pulsar and remnant would further constrain the above arguments .    a second , albeit less certain , pulsar / supernova remnant association from the pm survey , between psr  j10165857 and g284.31.8 was proposed recently by camilo et al .

    "ruiz & may 1986 ) and assuming the 21 kyr characteristic age of j10165857 to be correct , the implied pulsar velocity , 500 km s@xmath27 , is highly supersonic .",
    "although no pulsar wind nebula is obvious from the radio image , archival x - ray data from the _ einstein observatory _ show a compact source in the 0.14.5 kev band at the pulsar position .",

    "demonstrate that the energetics of this source are consistent with a compact pulsar wind nebula .",
    "further multi - wavelength studies are required to investigate the validity of the proposed association .",
    "the above discoveries highlight the power of the blind pulsar survey approach to find pulsar / supernova remnant associations .",
    "although g292.20.5 is nominally above the detection threshold of supernova remnant surveys , its previous non classification reflects the difficulties in identifying remnants in crowded and complex regions of the inner galaxy .",
    "in addition to the above two cases , manchester et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discuss a further seven possible associations between pulsars and supernova remnants in the pm survey . in two of these cases , psrs  j17263530 and j16324818 ,",
    "evidence for a supernova remnant comes from a posteriori inspection of archival continuum surveys .",
    "further investigation of all these candidate associations is now in progress .",
    "the nature of the @xmath30 unidentified sources from the egret all - sky survey ( see the most recent catalogue by hartman et al .  1999 ) has perplexed astronomers for some time . for the sources which have been convincingly identified so far , the only counterparts are neutron stars ( for example the crab , vela and geminga pulsars ) , the large magellanic cloud , a solar flare and agn .",
    "these identifications have motivated many efforts to search the unidentified sources for radio pulsar counterparts . in the past , despite intensive radio searches ( see e.g.  nice & sayer 1997 ) , only a few convincing associations between young energetic radio pulsars and the @xmath31-ray emission were found .",
    "part of the problem was that the large error boxes of the egret sources demanded a number of separate radio - telescope pointings to fully cover the area .",
    "more recently , however , progress has been made in finding new candidate associations with radio pulsars through the numerous discoveries in the pm survey , and also by careful targeted searches of several sources .",
    "to date , the pm survey has found just under 30 pulsars that lie within the boundaries of egret source error boxes ( camilo et al .",
    "2001 ; damico et al .  2001 ; kramer et al .",
    "positional coincidence alone , of course , is not sufficient to associate these pulsars since the density of pulsars along the galactic plane is large and the probability of chance alignment is significant . by cross - correlating",
    "all pulsars currently known with the egret catalogue , kramer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have been able to quantify the number of chance associations that might be expected and conclude that @xmath32 associations are likely to be real . in order to prove an association is real ,",
    "a detection of the pulsar period in the relevant egret photons is required .",
    "although this is possible for some of the pulsars with well - known ephemerides ( e.g.  the crab ) , back extrapolation of ephemerides of recently discovered young pulsars is more problematic due in part to the high level of timing activity .",
    "more importantly , many of the egret sources are weak and there are not many photons available for folding !",
    "ultimately , @xmath31-ray detections for many of the pulsar candidates will have to await future more sensitive telescopes such as glast .    in the absence of a detection in the egret photons , it is possible to evaluate the likelihood of a detection using other factors such as the spindown energy loss rate @xmath33 , egret source variability , and gamma - ray production efficiency @xmath34 .",

    "( 2002 ) during a campaign to find young pulsars in egret error boxes . in order to minimise",
    "the time spent searching the full extent of the error boxes , asca point sources with significant flux above 1 gev ( roberts , romani & kawai 2001 ) were selected as targets for deep observations . from a total of 5 sources selected and observed from parkes and arecibo ,",
