    "young embedded clusters are the primary laboratories for studies of the formation of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the dark clouds in the constellation of lupus are potentially attractive sites for such studies because of their proximity to the sun ( @xmath6 - 200  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "molecular and extinction maps have shown that the clouds extend across @xmath7 of the sky @xcite and the richest cloud in the complex in terms of ongoing star formation is lupus  3 .",
    "it has a fairly high surface density of young stars , with a peak value of @xmath8  stars  pc@xmath9 .",
    "the stellar population within lupus  3 is a good example of a nearby , well - defined small system embedded in a filamentary dark cloud @xcite .",
    "recent efforts have been made at extending the census of the stellar population in lupus  3 to low - mass stars and brown dwarfs @xcite . like their more massive counterparts ,",
    "low - mass disk - bearing members of embedded clusters can be identified by the presence of mid - infrared ( ir ) emission above that expected from a photosphere alone @xcite . however , conducting a wide - field mid - ir survey for faint , low - mass objects is technologically challenging .",
    "for instance , the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ was capable of mapping large fields , but it lacked the sensitivity for reliably reaching substellar members of nearby star - forming regions . with its combination of wide field of view and excellent sensitivity ,",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite has made it possible to search for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in young embedded clusters like lupus based on the presence of circumstellar disks @xcite .    in this paper , we present the results of a search for low - mass disk - bearing members of the most heavily populated cloud in the lupus complex , lupus  3 , using _",
    "s infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ?",
    "* ) and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "we begin by describing the mid - ir images of lupus  3 obtained with these instruments (   [ sec : obs ] ) and the identification of candidate low - mass disk - bearing objects with these data (   [ sec : cand ] ) .",
    "we then use optical spectroscopy to measure spectral types for a sample of these candidates and to determine if they are young members of lupus (   [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "in addition to the lupus  3 targets , we include in our spectroscopic sample a candidate brown dwarf near lupus  1 from @xcite .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the properties of the new low - mass stars and brown dwarfs found in this work (   [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "as a part of the guaranteed time observations ( gto ) of the irac instrument team , we obtained images of the lupus 3 cloud at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  with irac and at 24  with mips on the _ spitzer space telescope_. the irac observations were performed on 2004 march 7 ( ut ) and consisted of a mosaic of @xmath10 pointings , with each pointing separated by @xmath11 and aligned with the array axes .",
    "the mosaic was centered on @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( j2000 ) .",
    "images were obtained in the high dynamic range ( hdr ) mode , which consisted of one 0.4  s exposure and one 10.4  s exposure .",
    "this mosaic was observed twice consecutively .",
    "the mips observations were performed on 2004 february 23 ( ut ) and were centered on the same position as the irac mosaic .",
    "we operated mips in the scan mode with the medium scan rate and individual exposure times of 3.67  s. we performed six scans , each with a length of @xmath14 .",
    "we also make use of an irac map that was obtained by the cores 2 disks ( c2d ) spitzer legacy team @xcite on 2004 september 4 ( ut ) , which has the same location and dimensions as the gto mosaic . because the dates of these two maps are separated by six months , the roll angle of the telescope differed by 180@xmath15 between them . as a result ,",
    "the combination of the two maps provides full coverage in all four irac bands for the area imaged . unlike the gto mosaic ,",
    "the c2d data were not taken in hdr mode . instead , they consisted of two 10.4  s exposures at each pointing in a map that was performed once .",
    "the irac data were processed with the spitzer science center ( ssc ) s13.2.0 pipeline , the mopex software from the ssc , and the iracproc software @xcite . for each of the four irac bands",
    ", we produced one @xmath16 mosaic consisting of a combination of the gto and c2d data at 10.4  s and one @xmath17 mosaic consisting of the gto 0.4  s data .",
    "the mips data at 24  were reduced with mopex .",
    "the resulting mosaic had dimensions of @xmath18 and a total exposure time of 50  s at a given position . a false - color image composed of the mosaics at 3.6 , 8.0 , and 24",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "we used standard iraf photometry routines in the _ apphot _ package to identify all point sources in the irac and mips mosaics and to measure photometry for them . for the irac data",
    ", we adopted zero point magnitudes ( @xmath19 ) of 19.670 , 18.921 , 16.855 , 17.394 in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  bands , where @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "for most irac sources , we measured photometry using a radius of 4 pixels for the aperture and inner and outer radii of 4 and 5 pixels , respectively , for the sky annulus .",
    "we used a smaller aperture radius of 2.5 pixels for sz  108  a and b. the plate scale of the reduced irac mosaics was @xmath21  pixel@xmath22 . to adjust these measurements to the apertures used by @xcite ,",
    "we applied aperture corrections of 0.18 , 0.16 , 0.22 , and 0.48  mag for 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  @xmath23 m , respectively , which we measured from bright stars in these data . for mips sources , we measured photometry with a radius of 3 pixels for the aperture and inner and outer radii of 3 and 4 pixels , respectively , for the sky annulus .",
    "the plate scale of the reduced mips mosaic was @xmath24  pixel@xmath22 .",
    "for the mips 24  data we applied a flux calibration of 0.0067  mjy  ( dn / sec)@xmath22 and an aperture correction of 0.6  mag , which were provided by the mips gto team ( david trilling , private communication ) .",
    "we can identify possible new disk - bearing members of lupus  3 by examining the colors of sources detected in the irac and mips images @xcite . to do this , we first consider the colors of previously known members of lupus  3 . from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",

    "[ 5.8]-[8.0 ] in figure  [ fig:1234 ] , we plot the 35 previously known members that are not saturated and that have photometric uncertainties less than 0.1  mag in all of the irac bands .",
    "the irac colors of the known members exhibit either neutral colors consistent with a stellar photosphere or significantly redder colors that indicate the presence of a circumstellar disk , which is the same behavior that has been observed in irac data for young stars in other star - forming regions like taurus @xcite .",
    "as in the survey for new members of taurus by @xcite , we adopt color criteria of @xmath25-[4.5]>0.15 $ ] and @xmath26-[8.0]>0.3 $ ] for selecting candidate objects with disks in lupus  3 .",
    "we use these criteria because they encompass nearly all class  i and ii members of taurus @xcite .",
    "we applied these criteria to the @xmath27 sources with photometric errors less than 0.1  mag in all four irac bands , which are shown in figure  [ fig:1234 ] .",
    "this process produced 19 candidates .",
    "most of these candidates are fainter than the previously known members of lupus  3 , as illustrated in the diagram of [ 3.6 ] versus @xmath25-[8.0]$ ] in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",

    "we performed optical spectroscopy on 6 of the 19 candidate members of lupus  3 that were identified in the previous section using the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-3 ) on the magellan  ii telescope during the nights of 2006 february 9 and 11 .",
    "we observed 2mass  16081497 - 3857145 , 16085953 - 3856275 , and 16073773 - 3921388 during the first night and 2mass  16080017 - 3902595 , 16083733 - 3923109 , and 16085373 - 3914367 during the second night . on the first night",
    ", we also observed an additional target , source 18 from @xcite , which is also known as 2mass  j15414081 - 3345188 ( hereafter 2 m  1541 - 3345 ) .",
    "this object was identified as a candidate low - mass disk - bearing member of lupus  1 in a similar manner as our candidates @xcite .",
    "the procedures for the collection and reduction of the optical spectra were similar to those described by @xcite .",
    "the spectra obtained on the first and second nights exhibit wavelength coverages of 0.68 - 1.1 and 0.58 - 1  and resolutions of 6 and 4   , respectively .",
    "the spectra of the six candidates in lupus  3 are shown in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] and the spectrum of 2 m  1541 - 3345 is shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : spec2 ] and [ fig : spec3 ] .      to assess the membership of the candidate members of lupus in our spectroscopic sample and to measure their spectral types , we applied the optical classification methods developed in our previous studies of star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the membership diagnostics included emission lines , ir excess emission , gravity - sensitive spectral features ( na  i , k  i , feh ) , and reddening .",
    "we also examined the li absorption line at 6707    for the one spectrum that exhibited sufficient signal - to - noise at this wavelength . based on these diagnostics ,",
    "we find that all of the candidates in our spectroscopic sample are members of the lupus  3 cloud .",
    "the evidence of membership for each object is summarized in table  [ tab : new ] . for these young objects ,",
    "spectral types were measured through comparison to the averages of spectra for standard dwarfs and giants , which is the method that has been employed for most previous optical spectral types of low - mass members of star forming regions @xcite . during this process",
    ", reddening is applied to the dwarf / giant spectrum at each spectral type to optimize the match to the target spectrum .",
    "thus , both spectral types and extinctions were produced .",
    "these reddening estimates were fine - tuned by comparing each spectrum to previously known young objects with negligible extinction @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectral types for the 6 new members are listed in table  [ tab : new ] .",
    "the extinctions are indicated in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] , where they are quantified by the color excess between 0.6 and 0.9  ( @xmath28 ) , as done by @xcite .",
    "the positions of these new members and the previously known members of lupus  3 are indicated in figure  [ fig : image ] .    as with the lupus  3 candidates",
    ", we classified the spectrum of 2 m  1541 - 3345 through comparison to the averages of spectra of dwarfs and giants , arriving at a spectral type of m5.75@xmath30.25 and an extinction of @xmath29 with an upper limit of @xmath30 . through analysis of its spectral energy distribution",
    ", @xcite also estimated @xmath31 for 2 m  1541 - 3345 .",
    "the close agreement between its spectrum and the unreddened average of a dwarf and giant at m5.75 is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] . in comparison",
    ", @xcite reported a spectral type of m8 for 2 m  1541 - 3345 , but the average of m8v and m8iii is a poor match to its spectrum , as shown in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] .",
    "even if we classify our spectrum with dwarf standards as done by @xcite rather than averages of dwarfs and giants , we still arrive at a spectral type of m5.75 . as with the dwarf / giant average",
    ", m8v is a poor match to the spectrum of 2 m  1541 - 3345 . to determine if 2 m  1541 - 3345 is a member of the current generation of star formation in lupus , we examined the gravity - sensitive lines appearing in its spectrum , namely k  i , na  i , and feh .",
    "we compared the strengths of these lines between 2 m  1541 - 3345 and one of the new lupus  3 members , 2mass  j16073773 - 3921388 ( hereafter 2 m  1607 - 3921 ) .",
    "these two objects have the same spectral type , as shown in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] , and were observed on the same night . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec3 ] , we compare the k  i , na  i , and feh for these two objects .",
    "these lines are significantly stronger in 2 m  1541 - 3345 than in 2 m  1607 - 3921 , indicating that the former has a higher surface gravity and hence greater age .",
    "thus , we conclude that 2 m  1541 - 3345 is not a member of the latest generation of @xmath1  myr - old stars that are arising from the lupus clouds .",
    "instead , 2 m  1541 - 3345 is an older object , possibly a member of one of the older populations in the sco - cen complex @xcite .",
    "we have presented images of the lupus  3 star - forming cloud at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24  obtained with irac and mips aboard the _ spitzer space telescope_. after measuring photometry for all point sources detected in these data , we searched the data for new disk - bearing members of the cloud through red colors at 3.6 - 8.0  . among the 19 candidates identified in this way , 17 objects exhibit excess emission at 24  as well . through optical spectroscopy of six of the candidates ,",
    "we have confirmed that they are members of lupus  3 and have measured spectral types of m4.75 to m8 .",
    "these types correspond to masses of 0.2 - 0.03  @xmath0 according to theoretical evolutionary models @xcite and a compatible temperature scale @xcite .",
    "two of the new members , 2mass  j16083733 - 3923109 and j16085953 - 3856275 , are likely to be substellar .",
    "we note that the candidate 2mass  j16085324 - 3914401 and the new member 2mass  j16085373 - 3914367 are separated by only @xmath32 , and thus could comprise a wide binary system if the former is indeed a cluster member .",
    "similarly , the candidate 2mass  j16095628 - 3859518 has a separation of only @xmath33 from the known member hbc  627 .",
    "most of the remaining 13 candidates that lack spectroscopy have irac magnitudes that are indicative of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , as shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the candidates with the reddest irac colors ( @xmath25-[4.5]>0.5 $ ] , @xmath26-[8.0]>1 $ ] ) are probably class  i brown dwarfs or galaxies .",
    "because of their youth and proximity , the new members that we have found and the remaining candidates ( if confirmed ) are attractive targets for detailed studies of circumstellar disks and multiplicity near and below the hydrogen burning limit @xcite .    in addition to the candidates toward lupus  3 , we have performed spectral classification on 2 m  1541 - 3345 , which is a possible disk - bearing object that was identified in the vicinity of lupus  1 by @xcite . according to the same evolutionary models applied to the lupus  3 members , the spectral type of m5.75@xmath30.25 that we have measured for this object implies a mass of @xmath34  @xmath35 . in comparison",
    ", @xcite reported a significantly later spectral type of m8 for 2 m  1541 - 3345 and thus derived a much lower mass ( @xmath2  @xmath35 ) .",
    "in addition , rather than being a member of lupus  1 as assumed by @xcite , the gravity - sensitive lines in the spectrum of 2 m  1541 - 3345 indicate that it is older than members of the current generation of star formation in lupus  3 ( @xmath5  myr ) , and thus probably is not a member of the stellar population forming in the lupus  1 cloud .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that 2 m  1541 - 3345 is much too faint to be a member of lupus  1 given its spectral type of m5.75 .",
    "for instance , the combination of this spectral type and the luminosity of 2 m  1541 - 3345 from @xcite , which assumes the distance of lupus  1 , implies an age of 30 - 100  myr according to the evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "this age range is inconsistent with the ages of @xmath1  myr that are typical of star - forming clouds like lupus  1 .",
    "thus , 2 m  1541 - 3345 is probably similar to st34 , which is an evolved disk - bearing pre - main - sequence star that happens to be projected against a much younger star - forming region @xcite .",
