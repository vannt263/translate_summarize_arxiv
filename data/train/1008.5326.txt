    "in the quark model , a meson is composed of one quark pair and the spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath11 of a meson state is consequently fixed by this constituent quark pair , for instance @xmath12 for pseudoscalar mesons . for p - wave tensor mesons with @xmath2 ,",
    "both orbital angular momentum @xmath13 and the total spin @xmath14 of the quark pair are equal to 1 . by making use of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , the nine mesons , isovector mesons @xmath15 , isodoulet states @xmath16 and two isosinglet mesons @xmath17 , form the first @xmath18 nonet  @xcite .",
    "these mesons have been well established in various processes .",
    "@xmath8 meson decays into tensor mesons are of prime interest in several aspects .",
    "the main experimental observables in hadronic @xmath8 decays , branching ratios and cp asymmetries , are helpful to inspect different theoretical computations .",
    "one exploration concerns the isospin symmetry .",
    "for instance the @xmath19 channel has already been observed in 2006 with the branching ratio ( br ) @xmath20 for the charged channel and a similar one @xmath21 for the neutral channel  @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath22 mode possesses a large isospin violation : the br for the neutral mode @xmath23 is about one half of that for the charged mode @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "moreover , polarizations of the final mesons in @xmath8 decays can shed light on the helicity structure of the electroweak interactions . in the standard model , they are expected to obey a specific hierarchy when factorization is adopted to handle the decay amplitudes and the heavy quark symmetry is exploited to derive relations among the involved form factors . in particular the longitudinal polarization fraction is expected to be close to unity .",
    "deviations from this rule have already been experimentally detected in several @xmath8 decays to two light vector mesons , with the implication of something beyond the naive expectation . towards this direction @xmath8",
    "meson decays into a tensor meson can play a complementary role .",
    "for example the decay mode @xmath25 is mainly dominated by the longitudinal polarization  @xcite , in contrast with the @xmath26 where the transverse polarization is comparable with the longitudinal one  @xcite .    despite a number of interesting decay modes",
    "have been detected on the experimental side , currently there exist few theoretical investigations on @xmath8 to tensor transitions . since a tensor meson can not be produced by a local vector or axial - vector current , the @xmath27 decay amplitude is reduced in terms of the @xmath3 transition and the emission of a light meson @xmath28 .",
    "the motif of this work is to handle the first sector with the computation of the @xmath7 form factors , and in particular we will use the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite which is based on the @xmath29 factorization . if the recoiling meson in the final state moves very fast , a hard gluon is required to kick the soft light quark in @xmath8 meson into an energetic one and then the process is perturbatively calculable .",
    "keeping quarks intrinsic transverse momentum , the pqcd approach is free of endpoint divergence and the sudakov formalism makes it more self - consistent . as a direct consequence",
    ", we can do the form factor calculation and the quantitative annihilation type diagram calculation in this approach .",
    "our results for these form factors in this work will serve as necessary inputs in the future analysis of the semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath8 decays into a tensor meson .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we collect the input quantities , including the @xmath8-meson wave function , light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of light tensor mesons . in sec .",
    "[ section : formfactor ] , we discuss the factorization property of the @xmath3 form factors in the pqcd approach",
    ". subsequently we present our numerical results and a comparison with other model predictions is also given . branching ratios , polarizations and angular asymmetries of the semileptonic",
    "@xmath30 decays are predicted in sec .",
    "[ sec : semileptonic ] .",
    "our summary is given in the last section .",
    "we will work in the @xmath8 meson rest frame and employ the light - cone coordinates for momentum variables . in the heavy quark limit the light tensor meson in the final state moves very fast in the large - recoil region , we choose its momentum mainly on the plus direction in the light - cone coordinates .",
    "the momentum of @xmath8 meson and the light meson can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 as the mass of the tensor meson and the @xmath8 meson , respectively .",
    "the approximate relation @xmath34 holds for the momentum transfer @xmath35 .",
    "the momentum of the light antiquark in @xmath8 meson and the quark in light mesons are denoted as @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the momentum fraction .",
    "the spin-2 polarization tensor , which satisfies @xmath40 , is symmetric and traceless .",
    "it can be constructed via the spin-1 polarization vector @xmath41 : @xmath42,\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu}(0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt6 }   [ \\epsilon_{\\mu}(+)\\epsilon_\\nu(-)+\\epsilon_{\\nu}(+)\\epsilon_\\mu(- ) ]   + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\epsilon_{\\mu}(0)\\epsilon_\\nu(0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of the tensor meson moving on the plus direction of the @xmath43 axis , the explicit structures of @xmath41 in the ordinary coordinate frame are chosen as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the energy and the magnitude of the tensor meson momentum in the @xmath8 rest frame , respectively . in the following calculation , it is convenient to introduce a new polarization vector @xmath47 for the involved tensor meson @xmath48 which satisfies @xmath49 the contraction is evaluated as @xmath50 and thus we can see that the new vector @xmath47 plays a similar role with the ordinary polarization vector @xmath41 , regardless of the dimensionless constants @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "tensor meson decay constants are defined through matrix elements of local current operators between the vacuum and a meson state  @xcite @xmath53 the interpolating current for @xmath54 is chosen as @xmath55 $ ] with the covariant derivative @xmath56 : @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; the one for @xmath59 is selected as @xmath60 these quantities have been partly calculated in the qcd sum rules in refs .",
    "@xcite and we quote the recently updated results from ref .",
    "@xcite in tab .",
    "[ table : tdecayconstant ] .",
    "one interesting feature in these values is that the two decay constants of @xmath15 are almost equal but large differences are found for @xmath16 and @xmath61 . in the case of a light vector meson ,",
    "taking @xmath62 as an example , the transverse decay constant is typically about ( 20%30% ) smaller than the longitudinal one : @xmath63  @xcite .",
    ".decay constants of tensor mesons from ref .",
    "@xcite ( in units of mev ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "inspired by the success of the pqcd approach in the application to @xmath8 decays into s - wave mesons , we give a comprehensive study on the @xmath3 transition form factors .",
    "our results will become necessary inputs in the analysis of the nonleptonic @xmath8 decays into a tensor meson .",
    "the similarities in the lorentz structures of the wave functions and @xmath8 decay form factors involving a vector and a tensor meson allow us to obtain the factorization formulas of @xmath3 form factors from the @xmath4 ones .",
    "furthermore , the light - cone distribution amplitudes of tensor mesons and vector mesons have similar shapes in the dominant region of the perturbative qcd approach , and thus these two sets of form factors are found to have the same signs and related @xmath5-dependence behaviors . in the large recoil region , we find that our results for the form factors satisfy the relations derived from the large energy limit . the two independent functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are found to have similar size at @xmath6 point .",
    "we also find that the @xmath3 form factors are smaller than the @xmath4 ones , which is supported by the experimental data of radiative @xmath8 decays .",
    "at last , we also use these results to explore semilteptonic @xmath9 decays and we find that the branching fractions can reach the order @xmath10 , implying a promising prospect to observe these channels .",
