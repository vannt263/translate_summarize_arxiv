    "the possibility to exploit electron spin to manipulate currents in electronic microdevices has generated wide interest in the rapidly expanding field of spin electronics @xcite .",
    "technically , the itinerant electron spin may be put to use if the spin - flip scattering , intermixing the spin - up and spin - down channels , occurs at a rate @xmath0 which is slow compared to the inverse mean free time @xmath1 which characterizes the dissipative processes in charge of electrical resistivity .",
    "separation of electrons in two channels is a key element of the physics of a central spintronics phenomenon of giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) of metallic ferromagnetic - nonferromagnetic metal multilayers .",
    "the two - channel description of diffusive electrical transport from a ferromagnetic ( fm ) to a nonferromagnetic metal was given in @xcite and on a thermodynamic basis also in @xcite .",
    "due to the exchange splitting of the fermi surface in a fm metal the fermi energy corresponds to different parts of the band structure for spin - up and spin - down electrons , and therefore the two types of electrons have different densities of state @xmath2 and conductions @xmath3 .",
    "because of the conduction asymmetry @xmath4 an electrical current passing from a fm to a nonferromagnetic metal is polarized and injects magnetization .",
    "this effect shows up as an additional contact resistance .",
    "the size @xmath5 of the region of the spin accumulation is set by the equilibrium between spin injection through the interface and the spin - flipping processes in the bulk of the paramagnet .",
    "the spin diffusion length @xmath5 relates to the mean free path @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "an analysis of the two - channel model was given by valet and fert @xcite on the basis of the boltzmann transport equation in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "they have also applied the model to the geometry of the gmr with current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp - gmr ) .",
    "a significant advantage of their approach is the ability to describe measurable quantities in detail in terms of parameters of the theory , which allows to extract the latter from experiment @xcite .",
    "the formulas in @xcite , however , have been derived in a flawed assumption that while the conductivities @xmath3 of the majority and minority spins are different , the corresponding densities of states ( dos ) , @xmath2 , are equal . but the difference in @xmath2 is essential as it leads to a jump of the electric potential on an intermetallic interface , which also was not observed in the later work @xcite .",
    "neglect of the difference in @xmath2 results in an incorrect variation of the electric potential with distance from an intermetallic interface , and changes , _",
    "inter alia _ , the boundary contribution to resistance .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide expressions for boundary resistances of common multilayered systems corrected to allow the measurements of potential drop to be performed at any distance from interfaces , not necessarily @xmath9 .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the findings and provides a brief discussion .",
    "finally , an appendix with details of our approach to calculation is presented at the end of the paper .",
    "starting from the boltzmann equation , valet and fert @xcite showed that in the limit @xmath8 one can describe transport in the system introducing electrochemical potentials @xmath10 for the two spin channels @xmath11 as sums of chemical potentials ( accounting for the kinetic energy of electrons ) and the potential energy . for small deviations from equilibrium",
    "the chemical potential is given by the non - equilibrium electron density @xmath12 divided by the density of states @xmath13 on the fermi surface :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the electron charge , @xmath16 is the electric potential , and the condition @xmath17 is fulfilled owing to electroneutrality .",
    "we now briefly review the equations of two - channel diffusive transport to establish notations .",
    "electron current @xmath18 in the channel @xmath19 is a sum of a diffusion component and a contribution from the electron drift under the influence of an electric field @xmath20:@xmath21 where we used the einstein relation @xmath22 between the conductivity @xmath23 and the diffusion constant @xmath24 . in the bulk",
    "the excess electron density @xmath25 is zero , the electrochemical potentials for the two channels are equal : @xmath26 , and the current polarization is @xmath27 ( [ eq : ca ] ) .",
    "relaxation of non - equilibrium polarization of current near a boundary between two materials due to spin - flip processes is described by the continuity equations @xmath28    it is convenient to introduce the divergence @xmath29 between the two electrochemical potentials .",
    "it is non - zero only in the presence of spin accumulation : from ( [ eq : muupdown ] ) one finds that it is related to @xmath25 via @xmath30 substituting ( [ eq : musdef ] ) into ( [ eq : j ] ) and ( [ eq : dj ] ) we find that @xmath31 satisfies the diffusion equation    @xmath32    where the spin diffusion length@xmath33 equation ( [ eq : mus ] ) by means of relation ( [ eq : musdef ] ) describes the exponential decay of non - equilibrium spin density away from a boundary .    in order to find currents @xmath18 in each channel and the electric potential @xmath16 we introduce    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the net conductivity .",
    "differentiating @xmath36 yields @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the net current being conserved throughout the sample ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath36 is found from @xmath40 , hence in one dimension @xmath41 the spin current @xmath42 may then be found from the known distribution of @xmath31:@xmath43 from the definition ( [ eq : muupdown ] ) we find that the spatial distribution of @xmath16 is given by    @xmath44    where we have introduced the asymmetry of the density of states@xmath45 equations ( [ eq : musdef ] ) , ( [ eq : mus ] ) , ( [ eq : js ] ) , and ( [ eq :- eu ] ) completely describe electron transport inside a layer .    at distances @xmath9 from boundaries , when the divergence @xmath31 decays to zero , the two electrochemical potentials @xmath46 as well as the electric potential ( [ eq :- eu ] ) collapse to @xmath36 . i.e. @xmath36 is the value of the electrochemical potential that would be realized were there not non - equilibrium distribution of spin .",
    "however , if measurements are done closer than @xmath5 to an interface , one has to take into account that the non - equilibrium divergence of @xmath47 has not yet subsided .    to find charge and current distribution through the whole multilayer sample , eqs .",

    "the appropriate boundary conditions are the continuity of @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "but the inclusion of new parameters for interface resistance and spin - flip scattering renders the formulas very cumbersome , not changing the principal point of the paper .",

    "the solution is straightforward in the simplest case of an isolated boundary at the origin between two different materials with constants denoted by the two subscripts 1 and 2 .",

    "expressions for boundary resistances in this case are provided in appendix .      in the end , we cite formulas for a simplest spin - electronic device  a trilayer ` spin - valve ' : a ( thin ) layer of paramagnetic metal of thickness @xmath77 sandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers with parallel or antiparallel orientations of the magnetic momenta .",
    "we consider both the cases with and without supplying normal metal electrodes ( see fig .",

    "we assume the two ferromagnetic layers to have equal thickness @xmath78 .    in case of a symmetric trilayer without the supplying electrodes ( the uppermost structure in fig .",

    "in this brief study we focused on the effects of the density of states asymmetry in the diffusive transport through multilayered ferromagnetic - nonferromagnetic metal structures .    whereas conduction asymmetry brings about spin accumulation in a layer of thickness of the order of the spin diffusion length , and determines the overall drop of the electric potential in this layer ( apart from the trivial series resistance contributions ) , the dos asymmetry results in a jump of the electric potential directly at an intermetallic interface .",
    "in a standard valet - fert theory only the boundary contributions to resistance @xmath68 from the overall potential drop in the spin accumulation layer are calculated .",
    "these boundary resistances emerge only when measurements are done farther than the spin diffusion length from interfaces .    however , the series resistances that build up over the distance @xmath100 between the measurement points turn out to be larger than the boundary resistance @xmath68 . to identify the part of the resistance from the current conversion process on the boundary it is advantageous to attach probes closer to the interface .",
    "but in that case it should be remembered that because of the asymmetry of the density of states the interface contribution to the resistance differs from @xmath68 .",
