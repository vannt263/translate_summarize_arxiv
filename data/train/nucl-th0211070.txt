    "the relationship between the three - body and four - body models is opposite to that found here for @xmath46h : the @xmath70 calculation provides _ higher _ binding than a properly defined @xmath71 calculation yields ( with @xmath72 ) due to the attraction induced by the @xmath73-@xmath74 , @xmath75-@xmath76 , @xmath77-@xmath78 four - body rearrangement channels that include bound states for which there is no room in the three - body @xmath71 model .",
