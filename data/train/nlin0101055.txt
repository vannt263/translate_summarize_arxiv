    "semiclassical methods are based on classical mechanics ; the relevant classical manifolds form the `` skeleton '' to which the wave function is attached . however , associating a semiclassical wave function with a classical manifold is problematic when enclosed loops in phase space have area less than @xmath0 . if that happens , typically two or more stationary - phase points corresponding to distinct contributions to the semiclassical wave function are not well separated in phase .",
    "consequently , the stationary - phase ( sp ) method , on which semiclassical approximation is based , breaks down .",
    "worse , in some important situations , such as the universal homoclinic oscillations associated with chaotic regions of phase space , the bad enclosed loops may be repeated many times in a small region@xcite .",
    "although the semiclassical wave function diverges near caustics lurking near the small area loops , the exact quantum wave function is of course well - behaved .",
    "this is one manifestation of quantum smoothing over classical detail .",
    "we shall quantify below how this smoothing occurs .",
    "we suggest and test a new way of looking at the smoothing process in terms of `` replacement manifolds '' , in which new , well behaved classical manifolds are substituted for the original badly behaved ones",
    ". one application of this approach is uniformizing a semiclassical wave function in the vicinity of the ubiquitous homoclinic oscillations of a chaotic system .",
    "it is widely understood that very small changes in potentials or walls of billiards can have little effect on quantum eigenstates , but can drastically affect the classical manifold structure .",
    "this immediately implies a many - to - one relationship between the classical manifolds and quantum wave functions .",
    "that is , many different underlying classical manifold patterns correspond to the same wave function .",
    "now , whatever the choice of manifold ( amongst these equivalent forms ) we can suppose an appropriate uniformization exists which gives the correct wave function . however , the non - uniformized , simple semiclassical limit for the various choices of manifolds can differ drastically in accuracy .",
    "it is this fact which we exploit in the present paper .",
    "the paradigm example of uniformization is the airy function , i.e. the energy eigenfunction of the linear ramp potential .",
    "we take the potential to be of the form @xmath1 the schrdinger equation is @xmath2 after the shift @xmath3 and scaling transformation @xmath4 the schrdinger equation reads @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",

    "we have @xmath7 with solution @xmath8 thus @xmath9 and @xmath10 sp approximation for the momentum integral gives @xmath11 ^{1/2}e^{-(\\sqrt{2u})^{3}/6+i\\sqrt{2u}\\ u}+{\\rm c.c . }",

    "figure [ areaai ] illustrates the situation for the semiclassical position wave function , which becomes inaccurate when the area enclosed by the vertical @xmath14-line and the energy contour corresponding to the state @xmath15 falls below planck s constant . upon entering the `` bad '' region , the original momentum integral",
    "may be substituted for the wkb result , giving a uniformization .",
    "we have an integral over `` initial momentum , '' making this example a type of `` initial value representation '' ( ivr ) as first discussed by miller@xcite .",
    "of course in this case we know the result of the integral is an airy function , but in general there may be integrals which are not known analytically or even close to ones that are known .    in this paper",
    "we encounter more complex situations which are induced by nonlinear interactions , including chaos , reflection from corrugated surfaces , etc .",
    "we will show that intricate manifolds can sometimes be replaced by much simpler ones , which may themselves be evaluated semiclassically in any basis , using a much simplified uniformization if required .",
    "we now introduce an example of such a problematic lagrangian manifold , defined by a position - momentum relation @xmath16 this model was first introduced in ref.@xcite but was not explored there . the function ( [ man1 ] ) has oscillations of increasing amplitude and frequency , which however have the same area @xmath17 between successive zeros ( see fig .",
    "[ oldfig1 ] , small value of @xmath18 corresponds to small area of loops ) .",
    "this is also a characteristic property of homoclinic oscillations near a periodic orbit .",
    "the momentum @xmath19 spans an ever larger range as @xmath14 increases , but we now show that for @xmath20 the manifold s semiclassical behavior can be understood by replacing it with three smooth manifolds .",
    "the rules for replacement are simple to derive .",
    "the action function @xmath21 is the integral of @xmath19 : @xmath22 the `` wave function '' @xmath23 can be approximated by @xmath24 @xmath25 if @xmath20 . for small @xmath26",
    "this expression is nearly identical with ( [ wf1 ] ) with the original action ( [ act1 ] ) , because @xmath27 is bounded by @xmath28 .",

    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ oldfig2 ] .",
    "almost every discussion of the relation of classical and quantum mechanics for chaotic systems alludes to quantum smoothing , but here we have seen explicitly one way this smoothing comes about . for all reasonable purposes",
    "the three smooth classical manifolds accurately replace the rapid oscillations of the original manifold .",
    "note too that depending on the parameters the outlying manifolds @xmath35 and @xmath36 lie far beyond the limits of the original distributions .",
    "we shall discuss interesting consequences of this in the next section .",
    "so far , we have considered the wave function only in position representation where caustics are absent and the semiclassical form ( [ wf1 ] ) was accurate .",
    "the situation deteriorates drastically in momentum space . in order to find the wave function in momentum representation",
    ", we have to sum over all contributions from intersections of a horizontal line ( corresponding to a momentum eigenstate ) with the oscillating manifold ( [ man1 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath20 , the adjacent intersections will be separated by a phase @xmath37 that is smaller than 1 for any classically allowed momentum , and therefore the standard semiclassical approximation will break down for _ all classical momenta _ !",
    "usual airy - type uniformization methods of section [ standardunif ] ( also see @xcite ) do not serve under these circumstances , because the manifold is dense with caustics ( see the filled - in areas @xmath38 and @xmath39 in fig .  [ oldfig1 ] ) . apparently , we have no other choice but to part with semiclassical method and use a numerical fourier transform ( ivr ) over the position wave function to obtain @xmath40 . however using the replacement manifolds ( rms )",
    "is a much simpler and more intuitive approach which can rescue the situation .    to find the momentum wave function @xmath40 associated with the original manifold we add ( with appropriate weights ) wave functions @xmath41 corresponding to the three rms .",

    "[ oldfig2 ] ) , this integral can be evaluated by sp method ! in other words , although the semiclassical approximation completely fails for the original manifold , it works almost everywhere for the replacement manifolds .",
    "moreover , as we show in the following section , the standard airy uniformization procedure of section [ standardunif ] can be exploited to correct the inaccuracy in a narrow region near @xmath44 .",
    "we will see that the momentum wave function found by applying sp approximation to rms is in excellent agreement with numerical solution .",
    "we emphasize that the rms do not yield the original , badly behaved semiclassical result , but rather something much more accurate and much simpler .",
    "in order to capture other properties of homoclinic oscillations in our model , we consider a generalized manifold @xmath45 in which @xmath46 from ( [ man1 ] ) is replaced by a generic smooth function @xmath47 .",

    "the non - diagonal part of the semiclassical scattering matrix becomes @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "transformation back to original coordinates is achieved by a complex conjugate of ( [ can_trans1 ] ) .",
    "the free - space propagation is accomplished by a semiclassical green s function , exact in mixed representation @xmath227 putting all four pieces together , we obtain an expression for the scattered wave on a surface of section , @xmath228   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    before we proceed , it should be noted that the outcome of this four - step process , an integral representation of the scattered wave , can be viewed as a continuous superposition of waves emanating from sources along the boundary , with strength proportional to the normal derivative of the incident wave .",
    "it can be shown , in fact , that this process is equivalent to a generalized kirchhoff diffraction method @xcite .",
    "returning to expression  ( [ all_pieces1 ] ) , we recognize that the exponent in integral over @xmath229 corresponds to a classical manifold @xmath230 which is `` begging '' to be replaced by partial manifolds @xmath231 with weights @xmath232 because @xmath233 for the classically allowed momenta .",
    "the integral over @xmath229 is then simple to evaluate and is equal to @xmath234 \\\\ & = & 2\\pi \\sum_{n=-\\infty } ^{\\infty } j_{n}(\\lambda ) \\,\\delta ( k_{1x}+n\\beta -k_{x } )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this result and evaluating the trivial integral over @xmath235 , expression ( [ all_pieces1 ] ) becomes @xmath236 where @xmath237 .",
    "integral over @xmath238 picks up a pole at @xmath239 and the final answer is @xmath240 where @xmath241 .",
    "the scattered wave is thus a superposition of traveling and evanescent waves with wavevectors @xmath242 with coefficients @xmath243 these turn out to be very close to the exact quantum coefficients obtained in the appendix , but here we have avoided the solution of a linear system ( [ bc_4 ] )",
    ".    the uniform expression ( [ unif_coeff ] ) for coefficients of expansion ( [ expansion ] ) is surprisingly accurate .",
    "a two - dimensional density plot in fig .  [ quantumwf ] does not reveal any difference from the exact quantum solution while an analogous semiclassical plot clearly shows the caustics ( see fig .",
    "[ semiclassicalwf ] ) .",
    "even if we look at the poincar surface of section in a region with many classical caustics , the quantum and uniform solutions agree while semiclassical solution fails miserably ( see fig .",
    "[ wf_on_section ] ) .",
    "the uniform solution agrees with one found by garibaldi et al.@xcite and is somewhat more accurate than the same result without the @xmath244 prefactor obtained by hubbard and miller @xcite by scp approximation and by garibaldi et al .",
    "@xcite . as garibaldi et al .",
    "( who obtain three different solutions differing only by prefactors ) point out , these prefactors `` should not be taken too seriously . '' we agree : for traveling modes , they do not cause large errors , and since all these solutions neglect multiple scattering , we can not expect high accuracy of the already small coefficients of evanescent modes .",
    "as promised in section [ general ] , we have obtained almost identical result using rms as hubbard and miller with scp approximation @xcite .",
    "they found their answer for a hard wall as a limit of the solution for a smooth potential due to lennard - jones and devonshire@xcite .",
    "although we were lucky in this case to obtain exactly solvable integrals for rms , we can quite generally expect that the replacement manifolds will be much smoother than the original one , enabling their simple evaluation by sp method .",
    "we discuss the specific choice of parameters . selecting @xmath245 , @xmath246 was necessary for the validity of the single - scattering approximation . at first , it appears that the simple semiclassical approximation should be accurate for this regime of very shallow corrugation , since scattering from a flat wall has an exact semiclassical answer . the correct criterion , however , is based on the area of loops in phase space ( see fig .  [ poincare_surface ] ) . in this case , for small @xmath193 and @xmath247 , the height of loops is equal to the momentum kick in region of maximum slope , approximately @xmath248 and the width is half the period of corrugation , @xmath249 . the loop area is smaller than @xmath250 @xmath251 ( @xmath252 is the depth of corrugation ) and has to be compared to @xmath253 .",
    "we arrive at a surprising result that the validity of semiclassical approximation has nothing to do with the periodicity of corrugation , but only depends on the product @xmath254 of wave vector and corrugation depth .",
    "if this product is small , semiclassical approximation breaks down . in the opposite case of deep corrugation ,",
    "semiclassical approximation works , although we might have to take into account classical trajectories corresponding to multiple scattering .",
    "we have successfully uniformized several intimidating situations which can arise when repeated small areas or loops arise from enclosing classical manifolds using the replacement - manifold idea .",
    "this notion can rejuvenate physical intuition about the quantum wave function and also be a very convenient approach to an accurate result .",
    "two physically motivated cases were considered ( the homoclinic - like oscillation and the corrugated wall ) along with several other contrived cases to test the method .",
    "the present method should work in more complicated time - dependent problems if used with miller s ivr applied to van vleck s semiclassical propagator .",
    "after replacement manifolds are identified , the perturbative expansion contributions to the wave function could be found by sp approximation applied to these manifolds .",
    "future work along these lines includes the attempt to uniformize a full homoclinic tangle .",
    "it remains to be seen how convenient and generally applicable the replacement manifold idea is .",
    "however , it seems clear that we now have a new method which simplifies many problems while reinstating an intuitive foundation .",

    "one of us ( j. v. ) would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with a. mody and a. barnett .",
    "from conservation of energy , the scattered and incident waves must have the same magnitude of momentum . due to the periodicity of the wall in the @xmath14 direction ,",
    "the @xmath14-component of momentum is constrained by the bragg condition @xmath255 corresponding @xmath197-component of momentum @xmath256 will be real only if @xmath257 .",
