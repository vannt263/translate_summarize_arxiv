    "it should first be remarked that the positions of dib wavelengths on the sides of red rectangle bands , if meaningful , characterize an absorption spectrum . in an absorption spectrum , it is the minima in the spectrum which correspond to absorption lines positions and have physical meaning , as it is observed in the red rectangle nebula .",

    "how careful one must be when associating dibs and red rectangle bands .    on the other hand dib / red rectangle band associations",
    "do not rely only on wavelength coincidences .",
    "other criteria , as the importance of the bands in each spectrum , have to be taken into account . in the 5800    region for instance , it would indeed be remarkable that two sets of prominent features , in the spectra of reddened stars and in the spectrum of a nebula , can coincide and be independent .    there might thus be less dib / red rectangle band true associations than previously though .",
    "in addition , the difficulties raised by the relative positions of these dibs and red rectangle bands on the spectrum , and the objections in @xcite , could be overcome if the red rectangle spectrum was an absorption spectrum : it is then the valleys on the steep sides of the red rectangle bands in the nebular spectra which have to coincide with dibs , as observed .",

    "the presence of dibs @xmath73 and 6237 on the sides of @xmath57 may be a coincidence since the band is at the exact position of a telluric emission line .",
    "the presence in the background of the other bands and a relation to dibs is more difficult to understand , but may be justified by either of the following possibilities .",
    "these red rectangle bands can be due to an incomplete removal of atmospheric absorption @xcite .",
    "if they are related to dibs , it will necessarily be concluded that the corresponding dibs are also atmospheric absorption bands , and have not been removed during the data reduction process .",
    "next section shows that this hypothesis , as unexpected as it can be , can not be ruled out .",
    "this hypothesis could explain the complexity of the dib spectrum , but would also mean that some dibs need to have , in addition to an interstellar cloud , the atmosphere on the line of sight",
    ". should it be the case , the relative roles of the interstellar medium and of the atmosphere , in the formation of these dibs , need to be elucidated .",
    "it can not concern all dibs since some are detected with high redshifts in other galaxies ( for instance @xcite for the magellanic clouds , @xcite for ngc  1448 ) .",
    "another possibility is that dibs , although they are not observed toward hd44179 , exist at a low level in the spectrum of the star , and are detected in the light from hd44179 scattered by the nebula and/or the atmosphere .",
    "this hypothesis would justify that the observed spectrum of the nebula is an absorption spectrum , and its relationship to the dibs .",
    "alternatively , red rectangle bands due to the atmosphere may not be related to dibs .",
    "space observations of the red rectangle nebula and of reddened stars with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) will provide the most straightforward answer to these hypotheses .",
    "as the 5800    region , the 6200    region ( from @xmath74 to @xmath75 ) concentrates many features whose existence is doubtless , and coincide in the dib and red rectangle spectra .",
