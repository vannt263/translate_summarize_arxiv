    "mixing by fluid flows is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon that plays a central role in many of the applied sciences and engineering .",
    "a geophysical example is the mixing of aerosols ( e.g. , @xmath0 supplied by a volcano , say , or by human activity ) in the atmosphere .",
    "aerosols are dispersed by molecular diffusion on the smallest scales but are more effectively spread globally by atmospheric flows .",
    "the density  and density fluctuations  of some aerosols influence the albedo of the earth and thus have a significant environmental impact .",
    "hence it is important to understand fundamental properties of dispersion , mixing , and the reduction of concentration fluctuations by stirring flow fields .",
    "various aspects of mixing have been the focus of many review articles  . at the most basic level",
    ", the mixing of a passive scalar can be modeled by an advection - diffusion equation for the scalar concentration field with a specified stirring flow field . in this work",
    "we will focus on problems where fluctuations in the scalar field are generated and sustained by temporally steady but spatially inhomogeneous sources .",
    "the question of interest here is this : for a given source distribution , how well can a specified stirring flow mix the scalar field ?    mixing effectiveness can be measured by the scalar variance over the domain .",
    "a well - mixed scalar field will have a more uniform density with relatively `` small '' variance while increased fluctuations in the scalar density will be reflected in a `` large '' variance .",
    "we put quotes around the quantifiers small and large because the variance is a dimensional quantity that needs an appropriate dimensional point of reference from which it is being measured .",
    "several years ago thiffeault _ et al _ @xcite introduced a notion of `` mixing enhancement '' for a velocity field stirring a steadily sustained scalar by comparing the bulk ( space - time ) averaged density variance with and without advecting flow .",
    "mixing is accomplished by molecular diffusion alone in the absence of stirring , which can be quite effective on small scales but is not generally so good at breaking up and dispersing large - scale fluctuations quickly . stirring can greatly enhance the transport of the scalar from regions of excess density to depleted regions , suppressing the variance far below its diffusion - only value .",
    "the magnitude of this variance suppression by the stirring  the ratio of the variance without stirring to the variance in the presence of stirring  is a dimensionless quantity that provides a sensible gauge of the mixing effectiveness of the flow .",
    "different advection fields will have different mixing efficiencies stirring scalars supplied by different sources .",
    "it is then of obvious interest both to determine theoretical limits on mixing enhancements for various source configurations and to explore whether those limits may be approached  or even perhaps achieved-for particular flows .",
    "there have been many studies of stirring and mixing of a scalar with fluctuations sustained by spatially inhomogeneous sources and sinks .",
    "some of the earliest are by townsend  @xcite , who was concerned with the effect of turbulence and molecular diffusion on a heated filament .",
    "he found that the spatial localization of the source enhanced the role of molecular diffusivity .",
    "durbin  @xcite and drummond  @xcite introduced stochastic particle models to turbulence modeling , and these allowed more detailed studies of the effect of the source on diffusion .",
    "sawford and hunt  @xcite pointed out that small sources lead to a dependence of the variance on molecular diffusivity .",
    "these models were further refined by  @xcite . chertkov _",
    "et al _   and balkovsky & fouxon  @xcite addressed the case of a random , statistically - steady source .",
    "in this paper we study the enhancement of mixing by an advection field using a particle - based computational scheme that is easy to implement and applicable to a variety of source distributions .",
    "the idea is to develop a method that accurately simulates advection and diffusion of large numbers of particles supplied by a steady source , and to measure density fluctuations by `` binning '' the particles to produce an approximation of the hydrodynamic concentration field . unlike a numerical pde code",
    ", a particle code does not prefer specific forms of the flow or the source ( pde methods generally work best with very smooth fields ) .",
    "there is , however , no free lunch : the accuracy of the particle code is ultimately limited by the finite number of particles that can be tracked .",
    "the limitation to finite numbers of particles inevitably introduces statistical errors due to discrete fluctuations in the local density and systematic errors in the variance measurements due to binning .",
    "but these problems are tractable , and as we will show , the method proves to be quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient for some applications .",
    "in this section we review basic facts about the mixing enhancement problem as formulated by thiffeault , doering & gibbon _ et al _ @xcite and developed by plasting & young @xcite , doering & thiffeault @xcite , shaw _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and thiffeault and pavliotis @xcite . the dynamics is given by the advection - diffusion equation for the concentration of a passive scalar @xmath1 with time - independent but spatially inhomogeneous source field @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the molecular diffusivity and @xmath5 is a specified advection field that satisfies ( at each instant of time ) the incompressibility condition @xmath6 for simplicity , the domain is the @xmath7-torus , i.e. , @xmath8^d$ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we limit attention to stirring fields that satisfy the properties of statistical homogeneity and isotropy in space defined by @xmath9 where the overbar denotes time - averaging and @xmath10 is the root mean square speed of the velocity field , a natural indicator of the intensity of the stirring .",
    "these are statistical properties of homogeneous isotropic turbulence on the torus , but they are also shared by many other kinds of flows .",
    "we are interested in fluctuations in the concentration @xmath11 so the spatially averaged background density is irrelevant .",
    "it is easy to see from that the spatial average of @xmath11 grows linearly with time at the rate given by the spatial average of @xmath12 .",
    "hence we change variables to spatially mean - zero quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 that satisfy @xmath15 ( we must also supply initial conditions for @xmath11 and/or @xmath16 but they play no role in the long - time steady statistics that we are interested in . )    the `` mixedness '' of the scalar may be characterized by , among other quantities , the long - time averaged variance of @xmath11 , proportional to the long - time averaged @xmath17 norm of @xmath16 , @xmath18 the smaller @xmath19 is , the more uniform the distribution .",
    "the `` mixing enhancement '' of a stirring field is naturally measured by comparing the scalar variance to the variance with the same source but in the absence of stirring . to be precise ,",
    "we compare @xmath19 to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the solution to @xmath22 ( with , say , the same initial data although these will not affect the long - time averaged fluctuations ) .",
    "the dimensionless _ mixing enhancement factor _ is then defined as @xmath23 this quantity carries the subscript @xmath24 because we can also define _ multiscale mixing enhancements _ @xcite by weighting large / small wavenumber components of the scalar fluctuations : @xmath25 as discussed in doering & thiffeault @xcite , shaw _",
    "et al _ @xcite and shaw @xcite , @xmath26 provide a gauge of the mixing enhancement of the flow as measured by scalar fluctuations on relatively small and large length scales , respectively .",
    "we refer to them as enhancement factors because if one were to define an effective , eddy , or equivalent diffusivity @xmath27 as the value of a molecular diffusion necessary to produce the same value of @xmath28 with stirring , then @xmath29 . in this paper , however , we will focus exclusively on @xmath30 , the mixing enhancement at `` moderate '' length scales .",
    "there is a theoretical upper bound on @xmath30 valid for any statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic stirring field @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the fourier coefficients of the source and the pclet number , @xmath33 is a dimensionless measure of the intensity of the stirring .",
    "generally , we anticipate that @xmath30 is an increasing function of pe and the estimate in guarantees that @xmath34 as @xmath35 , the `` classical '' scaling necessary if there is to be any residual variance suppression in the singular vanishing diffusion limit .",
    "that is , if @xmath36 then @xmath37 has a nonzero limit as @xmath38 with all other parameters held fixed .",
    "it is natural to refer to any of the possible sub - classical scalings as `` anomalous '' .",
    "the upper limit to the mixing enhancement in depends on the stirring field only through @xmath10 via pe , but it depends on all the details of the source distribution . as studied in depth in references @xcite , the structure of the scalar source can have a profound effect on the high pe scaling of @xmath30 , notably for sources with small scales .",
    "it is physically meaningful to consider measure - valued source - sink distributions , like delta - functions , with arbitrarily small scales .",
    "it is precisely this source size dependence of @xmath39 that motivates the development of a computational method that can handle singular source distributions .    in this study , for computational simplicity and efficiency",
    ", we utilize the `` random sine flow '' as the stirring field . in the two - dimensional case",
    "this is defined for all time by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the period , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are random phases chosen independently and uniformly on @xmath45 in each half cycle , which assures the homogeneity of the flow field . in this case ,",
    "@xmath46 . in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "we employ @xmath47\\hat{\\textbf{\\i}}\\,,\\   & nt < t \\leq nt+ \\tfrac13 t ; \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the angle  @xmath49 randomizes the shear direction to guarantee isotropy of the flow .",
    "in a particle code for solving the advection - diffusion equation , the concentration field @xmath11 is represented by a distribution of particles .",
    "particles are introduced by generating random locations using the properly normalized source @xmath2 as a probability distribution function , then they are transported by advection and diffusion .",
    "the particle density , @xmath1 , is measured by covering the domain with bins counting the number of particles per bin .",
    "a discrete particle method is employed because it can easily deal with small - scale sources such as @xmath54 functions .",
    "it is also straightforward to implement with any advection field .",
    "the downside of a particle method is that it necessarily involves two kinds of errors : the number density of particles calculated by dividing the domain into bins is only resolved down to the size of the bins , and",
    "the measurement of @xmath11 always includes statistical errors due to the use of finite numbers of particles .      at each time",
    "step the system is evolved by advection , diffusion , the source , and sinks .",
    "an advection - only equation would be solved by moving particles along characteristics , and a diffusion - only equation would be solved by adding independent gaussian noises to each coordinate of each particle . with both advection and diffusion",
    "we need to solve a stochastic differential equation to determine the proper displacement of the particles during a time step .",
    "the stochastic differential equation is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a standard vector - valued wiener process .    in order to solve",
    ", we will consider cases where the displacement due to the noise in a subinterval of length @xmath57 ( where @xmath7 is the dimension ) is much smaller than the wavelength of the random sine flow .",
    "this condition is realized better and better as pe increases .",
    "then , during each subinterval , the drift field @xmath58 experienced by each particle can be approximated by a steady flow with a linear shear . in 2d , for the first half of the period for a particle starting at @xmath59 we approximate by @xmath60 and for the second half of the period , starting from @xmath61 , @xmath62 therefore , during the first half period we evolve the position of a particle through a time interval @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 need _ not _ be small ) by the map @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 the variance - covariance matrix of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is @xmath69 which is realized by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent @xmath73 random variables ( normally distributed with mean  @xmath24 and standard deviation  @xmath74 ) .",
    "the matrix   describes the evolution of a passive scalar field in a shear flow  @xcite .",
    "therefore the time evolution map during the first half period is    @xmath75    a similar map is employed during the second half of the period .",
    "these stochastic maps include the shear  in the approximation that the shear remains constant for each particle during each half cycle  that causes a `` distortion '' of a gaussian cloud of particles ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss ] .",
    "the same calculations apply for the three - dimensional case : for the first subinterval , the time - evolution map is    @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ & \\phantom{\\rightarrow x_0}+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{6}(s_{2}^{\\ 2}+s_{3}^{\\ 2})\\kappa ( \\delta t)^{3}+2\\kappa\\delta t } \\",

    "the maps for the other subintervals can be obtained by cyclic permutation of the coordinates .    the steady scalar source",
    "is realized by introducing a new particle one by one using normalized @xmath2 as a probability distribution function .",
    "numerically , such a probability distribution function can be realized by mapping uniform random numbers over @xmath81 $ ] with the inverse of the cumulative probability distribution function in question .",
    "new particles are added constantly so the total number of particles continues to increase , which slows down the computation . to cope with increasing particles",
    ", we implement a particle subtraction scheme .",
    "particles eventually get well mixed and `` older '' particles do not contribute to the value of the hydrodynamic variance .",
    "there is no added value in keeping track of particles that have been in the mix for a very long time , and we can simply remove them from the system after a sufficiently long time .",
    "it is very important to keep track of the `` age '' of each particle , however , and to only remove sufficiently old well - mixed particles .",
    "( for example , if a random fraction of particles is removed at regular time intervals , then the simulation becomes one of a system particles with a random finite lifetime , described by an advection - diffusion equation with an additional density decay term . )    in order to determine how old particles must be in order to safely remove them without affecting the hydrodynamic variance , prior to a full simulation run a test is performed as follows . starting from an initial set of @xmath82 particles located in space according to the source distribution , the flow and diffusion are allowed to act and the variance of the number of particles per bin , which decays with time , is monitored .",
    "the number @xmath82 is of the order of the number of particles that are introduced in the full simulation during , say , an interval of length @xmath41 characteristic of the random sine flow .",
    "the variance does not decay all the way to zero , however , but rather to the variance expected when @xmath82 particles are randomly distributed among the bins .",
    "the time when the variance achieves this random - distribution variance , measured beforehand for a given flow and diffusion strength , is then the required `` aging '' time before particles can be safely removed in the full simulation with the steady source .",
    "such a trial run is performed for each flow , diffusion strength , source distribution and particle number because this `` mixing time '' depends on all these factors .",
    "futher details of the criteria for removing old particles and extensive tests and benchmark trials may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the variance @xmath83 is measured by monitoring the fluctuations in the number of particles per bin , and time - averaging . in @xmath7 dimensions",
    "the domain is divided into @xmath84 bins and the code calculates @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the number of particles in a bin . then @xmath83 is initially approximated by @xmath87 we say `` initially '' because the expression above includes both the hydrodynamic fluctuations of interest _ and _ discreteness fluctuations resulting solely from the fact that each bin contains a finite number of particles .",
    "the subtraction scheme eliminates the `` well - mixed '' particles that do not contribute to the value of the hydrodynamic variance .",
    "but even if the system were completely mixed so that theoretically , @xmath88 , the measured variance @xmath89 would be ( very close to , for small bins ) @xmath90 , which is on the order of @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the total number of particles in the domain .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath93 is represented in this particle method by only a finite number of particles in each finite size bin .",
    "that is , @xmath19 as defined by ( [ measure ] ) is nonzero even when the particles are uniformly distributed : then the bulk variance includes fluctuations as if @xmath92 particles were randomly thrown in @xmath84 bins .",
    "the helpful fact is that the bulk variance contribution from these _ background fluctuations _ due to finite numbers of particles in the bins",
    "does not depend on ( i.e. , is uncorrelated with ) the hydrodynamic density variation from bin to bin .",
    "the total contribution to the variance is the sum of the `` extra '' variance in each bin which is linear in the ( mean ) number of particles in each bin .",
    "hence the sum of the variances is @xmath94 and the bulk variance contribution from the background fluctuations , @xmath95 , can simply be subtracted from the initial estimate for @xmath19 in ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "the net result is our measured value of the hydrodynamic variance .",
    "in addition to the inevitable fluctuations due to discreteness , density variations are observed only down to the length scales @xmath96 because of the binning density , which is another source of error in this procedure .",
    "we use @xmath97 , which tests and benchmark studies indicate is sufficient for the examples studies here  @xcite .",
    "the variance is calculated once for each subinterval , and the instant when it is calculated is determined randomly in order to obtain an unbiased time average .",
    "thus each subinterval is divided into two parts , before and after variance calculation , and the particle transport and source processes are appropriately adapted .",
    "the final measured quantities are long time averages that are observed to be converged to within the error indicated on the plots below .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of source - sink scales on maximal and actual mixing enhancements , we performed a series of simulations for square - shaped sources of various sizes @xmath98 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqfig ] .",
    "fig  [ fig:2dbounds ] shows the upper bounds on @xmath30 for square sources and a @xmath54-function source in 2d computed from ( [ bound ] ) .",
