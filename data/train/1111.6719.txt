    "fracture in engineering materials is a long - standing topic of research due to problems that arise with technological applications and the ensuing economical implications .",
    "thus , for decades a lot of attention has been focused on understanding the macroscopic and microscopic factors which trigger failure .",
    "recently , the interest and the need for better understanding of the interplay between elastic and fracture properties of brittle materials has been revived due to the rapidly developing design of advanced structural materials .",
    "promising aspects for applications include reversible polymer networks @xcite , and also graphene , that shows unusual thermomechanical properties @xcite",
    ". among other things , graphene , which is a honey - comb lattice packed with @xmath13 atoms can be used as anti - corrosion gas barrier protective coating @xcite , in chemical and bio - sensors @xcite , or as efficient membrane for gas separation @xcite . in all possible applications",
    "the temperature and stress - dependent fracture strength of this 2d - network is of crucial importance .",
    "graphene has been investigated recently by barnard and snook @xcite using _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical techniques whereby it was noted that that the problems `` has been overlooked by most computational and theoretical studies '' .",
    "an important example of biological microstructure is _ spectrin _ , the red blood cell membrane skeleton , which reinforces the cytoplasmic face of the membrane . in erytrhrocytes ,",
    "the membrane skeleton enables it to undergo large extensional deformations while maintaining the structural integrity of the membrane .",
    "a number of studies , based on continuum- @xcite , percolation- @xcite , or molecular level @xcite considerations of the mechanical breakdown of this network , modeled as a triangular lattice of spectrin tetramers , have been reported so far .",
    "many of these studies can be viewed in a broader context as part of the problem of thermal decomposition of gels @xcite , epoxy resins @xcite and other 3d networks both experimentally @xcite , and by means of simulations @xcite in the case of poly - dimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) .",
    "the afore - mentioned examples illustrate well the need for deeper understanding of the processes of failure in brittle materials . besides analytical and laboratory investigations , computer simulations",
    "@xcite have provided meanwhile a lot of insight in aspects that are difficult for direct observations or theoretical treatment - for a review of previous works see alava et al .",
    "most of these studies focus on the propagation of ( pre - existing ) cracks , relating observations to the well known griffith s model @xcite of crack formation .",
    "a number of important aspects of material failure have found thereby little attention .",
    "thus only a few simulations examine the rate of crack nucleation which involves long time scales necessary for thermal activation - see , however , @xcite .",
    "effects of system size on the characteristic time for bond rupture have not been examined except in a recent md study by dias et al . @xcite .",
    "also recombination of broken bonds has not been considered .",
    "these and other insufficiently explored properties related to fracture have motivated our present investigation of a free - standing 2d honeycomb brittle membrane by means of molecular dynamics simulation . in view of the possible applications as anti - corrosion and gas barrier coating , we consider a radially - spanned sheet of regular hexagonal flake shape so as to minimize effects of corners and unequal edge lengths that are typical for ribbon - like sheets .",
    "tensile constant force is applied on the rim of the flake , perpendicular to each edge . by varying system size , tensile force and temperature",
    ", we collect a number of results which characterize the initiation and the course of fragmentation in stretched 2d honeycomb networks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief introduction , we sketch our model in sec . [ sec_model ] where we consider interactions between atoms in the brittle honeycomb membrane ,",
    "define the threshold for bond scission , and also introduce some basic quantities that are measured in the course of the simulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec_md ] we present our simulation results , presenting briefly the results on recombination of broken bonds - [ subsec_rec ] , the distribution of bond scission rates over the membrane surface , the dependence of the mean first breakage time ( mfbt ) before a bond scission takes place and of the mean failure time until the 2d sheet breaks apart on applied tensile force , and examine how these times depend on membrane size and temperature - [ subsec_mfbt ] .",
    "the formation of cracks at different cases of applied stress as well as their propagation in a 2d honeycomb brittle sheet are briefly considered in subsection [ subsec_cracks ] .",

    "the most important conclusions that can be drawn from our molecular dynamics simulation can be summarized as follows :    * bonds scission in hexagonal 2d sheets with honeycomb structure of the underlying network under subjected to external pulling perpendicular to flake s edges take place overwhelmingly at the sheet periphery * the mean first breakage time of breaking bonds depends on membrane size @xmath5 as a power law , @xmath137 with @xmath188 . *",
    "the failure time @xmath104 until a brittle sheet disintegrates into pieces follows a power law too , @xmath189 , and an exponential decay @xmath190 upon increasing strength of the pulling force , in agreement with griffith s criterion for failure .",
    "* cracks emerge in the vicinity of membrane edges and typically propagate parallel to the edges , splitting the sheet in two pieces of size ratio of @xmath191 .",
    "* crack propagation speed is observed to increase rapidly with tensile force    we believe that these findings can be seen as generic also for 2d network brittle sheets of different geometry ( hexagonal lattices , or quadratic lattices with second nearest - neighbor bonding ) where similar interplay between elastic and fracture behavior is expected to take place .",
