    "since wolf - rayet stars are descended from only the most massive ( @xmath23040 m@xmath3 ) stars , this argues that has an unusually large unevolved massive ( ob ) star population as well , with a _ galaxy - wide _ surface density of massive stars that is higher by a factor of 2 than any other local group galaxy .",

    "0.1 in _ confusing foreground and background sources _ 0.1 in    is at low galactic latitude so confusing foreground sources are a natural concern .",
    "based on results from the galactic plane survey ( see section 9.1 of motch et  al .",

    ". furthermore , the hri source is found at a position where one might expect x - ray activity in based on its emission in other wavebands .",
    "for example , the x - ray source is almost exactly in the centre of the ys93 non - thermal superbubble ( see ys93 for good arguments , but not rigorous proof , that the superbubble itself is in ) and near a region of recent star formation .",
    "the superbubble has an angular size of about @xmath44 arcmin@xmath43 , so there is less than about a 0.02 per cent chance of having a confusing foreground source as bright as x-1 in front of it .",
    "we can further argue against some types of possible foreground sources based on examination of optical images .",
    "for example , we can use the nomograph shown in figure  1 of maccacaro et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) which relates the expected 0.33.5  kev x - ray flux to the visual magnitude for various types of astronomical objects .",
    "if we use the power - law model with a column of @xmath34 @xmath9 ( see above ) , we predict a 0.33.5  kev flux of @xmath45 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 .",
    "there are no optical stars in the x - ray error circle with @xmath37 magnitudes brighter than 20.8 ( based on analysis of a @xmath37 image taken with the 6-m telescope of the russian academy of sciences ) , and thus from figure  1 of maccacaro et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) we see that the combined x - ray flux and @xmath37 magnitude limit do not agree well with those expected from a normal foreground star ( this is true even for 0.33.5  kev fluxes as low as @xmath46 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 ) .",
    "motch et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) state that about 85 per cent of their sources from the galactic plane survey are stars with x - ray emitting coronae , so we have ruled out the most probable type of confusing foreground source . in summary , although we can not formally prove that a foreground contaminating source is impossible , we consider one to be quite unlikely .",
    "confusing background sources ( e.g. seyfert galaxies , quasars and clusters of galaxies ) are also unlikely .",
    "examination of figure  18 of motch et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows that the probability of having an extragalactic source as bright as x-1 behind the superbubble is @xmath47 .",
    "this is a conservative probability estimate since any extragalactic source would also suffer from x - ray absorption by matter within the plane of .",
    "some types of possible extragalactic confusing sources ( e.g. clusters of galaxies ) can also be ruled out based on the x - ray variability described below .    0.1 in _ luminosity , spatial extent and variability _ 0.1 in    given that x-1 is probably located in the plane of , we expect that it will have some absorption over the galactic column of @xmath31 @xmath9 .",
    "we expect an intrinsic column in of @xmath48 @xmath9 based on figure 5 of ys93 .",
    "we thus adopt a total column of @xmath49 @xmath9 . using this column and a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath30",

    "is @xmath51 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 , and the 0.12.5 kev absorption - corrected flux is @xmath52 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 .",
    "while we note that the flux correction factor used above is large ( about 4.9 ) , the model we have used seems physically appropriate given the probable nature of x-1 ( see below ) , and the presence of a large column between the plane of and earth is without question . at a distance of 1 mpc",
    "the absorption - corrected flux corresponds to a mean isotropic luminosity of @xmath53 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "if , for comparison , we only use the galactic column and neglect the probable absorption in then we obtain a 0.12.5 kev absorption - corrected flux of @xmath54 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 and an isotropic luminosity of @xmath55 erg s@xmath1 ( the power - law normalization and absorbed flux for this model are given above ) .",
    "inspection of the x - ray morphology of x-1 does not show any strong evidence for deviations from a circular shape .",
    "as the ys93 superbubble has an extent of @xmath56 arcsec , we have examined the spatial extent of x-1 ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "x-1 is much less extended than the radio emission from the superbubble . while the radial profile shown in figure  4 is not formally consistent with the nominal point spread functions described in david et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , it is known that aspect solution errors can lead to a significant broadening of the profiles of point sources in some hri observations ( see the discussion in morse 1994 ) .",
    "we do not have enough counts to perform aspect error correction using the morse code hriaspcor in ftools , and tv cas is too far off axis to be a useful comparison point source .",
    "the current data do not give strong evidence for spatial extent over that from a point source which suffers from aspect solution errors .",
    "furthermore , the variability discussed below suggests that most of the x - ray flux originates from a compact region with an extent of less than @xmath57 light day .    count rates from should be averaged over an integer multiple of the 400-s wobble period when used to search for rapid variability of cosmic x - ray sources ( see brinkmann et  al . 1994 ; although note that the effects of the wobble are less serious for the hri than the pspc ) .",
    "we have used a source cell with a radius of 20 arcsec to extract a light curve of x-1 .",
    "we use 400-s bins and neglect partially filled bins . in figure 5",
    "we show part of this light curve where there is evidence for x - ray variability .",
    "the count rate from x-1 appears to have dropped by over a factor of 2 within a day .",
    "we have calculated the poisson probability that the variability is merely due to photon statistics , and it is less than @xmath58 . even taking into account issues such as those described in press & schechter ( 1974 ) , the variability appears to be of high statistical significance .",
    "we have used a double panel format in figure 5 for clarity because our observations are spread over 10.8 days , and there are no data in between the two panels shown in figure 5 .",
    "we have verified the variability shown in figure 5 using two independent analysis software systems .",
    "the mean background count rate in the source cell , computed using a large , nearby , circular , background cell , is @xmath59 count s@xmath1 for the left panel and @xmath60 count s@xmath1 for the right panel .",
    "we have verified that there is no positional error ( e.g. a shift or rotation ) that could be moving the source out of our source cell during the times shown in our right hand panel ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "if we bin an image using only the data from the left hand panel , we can clearly see x-1 over the background level . however , if we bin an image using only the data from the right hand panel , we can not see x-1 despite the fact that the right hand panel has twice as much exposure and a slightly lower background .",
    "there is evidence for variability similar to that shown in figure 5 throughout our observation .",
    "the highest count rate observed is about twice the mean count rate , which corresponds to a 0.12.5 kev isotropic luminosity of @xmath61 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "as discussed below , it appears likely that x-1 is an x - ray binary system in .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not appear to provide strong constraints on the binary orbital period via periodic x - ray flux variations ( e.g. eclipses ) .",
    "this is due partially to the low count rate , but also to the fact that our 32.7  ks of exposure is broken into numerous , small , separated blocks with durations between 12003000  s.      we have used pss and the hri point spread function to search our hri field for any other x - ray point sources coincident with the extent of . we do not detect any point x - ray sources stronger than @xmath62 within the extent shown in figure 5 of ys93 .",
    "we do not detect any significant point sources near the maser sites , and we do not detect the radio continuum source described in section 3.3 of argon et  al .",
    "the standard analysis software system ( sass ) reports a possible diffuse x - ray source at @xmath19 00@xmath20 20@xmath21 18.6@xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath2418@xmath2550@xmath26 with a positional error of 20 arcsec .",
    "careful examination of the x - ray image and the sass output shows that this source is not of high statistical significance in the current data ( e.g. there are background fluctuations at almost comparable levels ) .",
    "however , the fact that the sass x - ray source is within 12.5 arcsec of a bright radio source discussed in section 3.4 of klein & gr \" ave ( 1986 ) suggests that it may well be real ( note that some of the source labeling in section 3.4 of klein & gr \" ave 1986 is incorrect ) .",
    "the sass x - ray source is also quite close to two of the sources listed in table 1 of ys93 .",
    "this is the location of an h  i hole in which may have been created by supernova events .",
    "the ` best guess ' hri count rate for this source is @xmath63 count s@xmath1 .",
    "further x - ray observations are needed to study this emission .",
    "we have used pss and the hri point spread function to place upper limits on point sources at several representative positions in that lie @xmath64 arcsec from x-1 .",
    "the typical @xmath65 upper limit is about @xmath66 count s@xmath1 . using a @xmath30 power law with a column of @xmath67 @xmath9 ( motivated by the galactic column and figure 5 of ys93 )",
    ", this corresponds to an absorbed 0.12.5 kev flux upper limit of about @xmath68 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 and an absorption - corrected 0.12.5 kev flux upper limit of about @xmath69 erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 .",
    "the isotropic luminosity upper limit is about @xmath70 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "this upper limit is appropriate for x - ray sources that are extended on scales smaller than or comparable to that of the hri spatial resolution ( about 5 arcsec which corresponds to about 24 pc at the distance of ) .",
    "thus , this limit can be applied to supernova remnants in the free - expansion or sedov - taylor phases ( with ages @xmath71 yr ) , although many supernova remnants have luminosities lower than our upper limit ( see table  3.2 of charles & seward 1995 ) .",
    "of course , it is possible that there are even more highly obscured x - ray sources in ( i.e. sources that suffer even stronger intrinsic absorption in itself ) with larger isotropic x - ray luminosities than the limit given above .",

    "most of the x - ray sources in table  1 are probably unrelated foreground or background sources , but a couple of them may be associated with these galaxies or currently unknown globular clusters .",
    "none of the sources in table  1 is currently listed in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) or the simbad database .",
    "we give optical morphologies of possible counterparts to the x - ray sources in table  1 .",
    "source 4 is near the center of a ring of stellar images and there appears to be a very faint object about 2 arcsec southwest of the x - ray position .",
    "source 5 is almost certainly not a globular cluster , as it is not resolved into stars on red palomar plates .",
    "it appears to be a foreground star .",
    "x-1 appears to be located in near the centre of the ys93 non - thermal radio superbubble , and it has a powerful mean 0.12.5 kev isotropic luminosity of @xmath89 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "single ( nondegenerate ) stars do not produce this much x - ray emission ( e.g. rosner , golub & vaiana 1985 ; pollock 1987 ; kashyap et  al .",
    "1992 ; and references therein ) , and the x - ray luminosities of cataclysmic variables also fall short by several orders of magnitude ( e.g. eracleous , halpern & patterson 1991 ) .",
    "the observed variability argues against most of the emission coming from a cluster of stars or a supernova remnant .",
    "thus it appears most likely that we have discovered an accreting neutron star or black hole in a binary system .",
    "the highest 0.12.5 kev luminosity we observe from x-1 is @xmath61 erg s@xmath1 , and the total x - ray luminosity is likely to be @xmath90 erg s@xmath1 if the source is indeed an accreting neutron star or black hole ( see white , nagase & parmar 1995 for a discussion of the x - ray spectral energy distributions of x - ray binaries ) .",
    "this is the eddington limit luminosity for a @xmath6 m@xmath91 object which is above the maximum mass for a neutron star .",
    "while this may suggest the compact object is a black hole , we can not rule out a neutron star which emits anisotropically or at a super - eddington rate . this is especially true in light of the low heavy element abundances in ( e.g. lequeux et  al . 1979 ) and the apparent x - ray luminosity / abundance relation for accreting compact objects ( clark et  al .",
    "1978 ; section 2.5 of van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .    as a peculiar emission - line star ( wr17 ) has been located in the tiny hri error circle by massey & armandroff ( 1995 ; see above ) , it is worth investigating whether this could be the binary companion star to the accreting compact object .",
    "if , as claimed by massey & armandroff ( 1995 ) , this star is a wn type wolf - rayet star , then x-1 would be a more x - ray luminous version of the possible wolf - rayet x - ray binaries reported near the centre of 30 doradus ( wang 1995 ; also see van kerkwijk et  al .",
    "1996 and references therein regarding the possible wolf - rayet nature of cyg x-3 ) .",
    "the system would have originally been a binary with two massive stars , and a supernova in this system would probably have contributed to the creation of the ys93 superbubble ( such a system might plausibly remain bound after a supernova ; see brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ) .",
    "of course , the identification of x-1 with wr17 has not yet been proven and x-1 could also be a low mass x - ray binary in which the optical companion is below the current threshold of detectability ( cf .",
    "stocke , wurtz & khr 1991 ; but note that petre 1993 suggests that low mass x - ray binaries are rare in star forming regions ) .",
    "finally , the presence of a powerful x - ray source in the centre of an unusually large bubble of radio emission invites a brief comparison with ss433 and w50 . ys93",
    "compared the radio surface brightness ( @xmath92 ) and diameter ( d ) of their superbubble to the so - called ` @xmath92-d relationship ' for snr in the magellanic clouds . while the physical meaning , if any , of the @xmath92-d relationship is somewhat obscure ( especially when transported wholesale from the magellanic clouds to ) , the ys93 superbubble does appear to have a much larger diameter than expected given its radio surface brightness .",
    "ys93 proposed a multiple snr model to explain this fact .",
    "while the ys93 model appears entirely plausible , w50 also lies off the @xmath92-d relation ( margon 1984 ; its largest dimension is about 65 pc ) .",
    "the growth of the ys93 superbubble could have been influenced by x-1 ( see section 5 of margon 1984 ) .",
    "x-1 does not appear to have redshifted / blueshifted emission lines in the spectrum of massey & armandroff ( 1995 ) and there is no strong radio point source at its position , so if there were ss433-like activity in the past it appears to have ended .    or",
    "_ sax _ observations of would be very useful as they would ( 1 ) probably obtain a significantly higher count rate from x-1 due to the heavy column which strongly affects the hri band , ( 2 ) allow a better variability study including searches for eclipses from a high mass companion and x - ray pulsations , ( 3 ) allow a measurement of the spectral shape of x-1 and ( 4 ) search for additional variable and highly absorbed x - ray sources in .",
    "they would also allow a much more precise determination of the luminosity of x-1 since the column correction factor would not be so large .",
    "we are attempting to obtain such observations .",
    "we are also trying to search for evidence of a binary star ( especially wr17 ) within the x - ray error circle and obtain higher quality spectra to further examine the wolf - rayet classification of wr17 by massey & armandroff ( 1995 ) .",
    "our current spectra do not allow definitive discussions of either of these issues .    if there are any x - ray binaries in the centres of ngc  147 or ngc  185 , they were quite faint at the times of these observations ( see section 2.2 for upper limits ) .",
