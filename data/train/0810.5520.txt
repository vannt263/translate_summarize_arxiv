    "( note that we vary our assumptions slightly from those in section 1 of @xcite , replacing the requirement that @xmath2 be a subgroup of the orthogonal group with our assumption that @xmath2 preserves the lattice .",

    "indeed we see that the arguments in the proof of theorem [ mainprime ] rely heavily on the fact that the cyclotomic polynomials for prime powers have non - negative coefficients , which is not true of cyclotomic polynomials in general .",
    "it does seem possible that theorem [ main ] may be extended to larger classes of abelian groups .",
    "here the situation is complicated by the fact that there are in general many ways to write a character of a non - cyclic group as a linear combination of transitive permutation characters .",
    "indeed , one may repeat the arguments of section [ permchars ] , now assigning any value at all to @xmath277 for @xmath26 a non - cyclic subgroup of @xmath2 and keeping @xmath278 , and again obtain via mbius inversion coefficients expressing @xmath24 as a linear combination of permutation characters .",
    "the problem then becomes one of whether values of @xmath277 can be chosen for the non - cyclic subgroups in such a way that the resulting coefficients are non - negative integers . in certain simple cases ( e.g. , @xmath279 and @xmath280 for @xmath133 prime )",
    "this can be done more or less by hand , but a more general approach would be of interest .    finally , note that although our character formulas involve terms coming from the face structure of fixed subcomplexes of @xmath13 , no knowledge of this structure was necessary in the proofs of our results ( other than that the complexes are cohen - macaulay ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility of arriving at properties of @xmath13 via investigation of the characters .",
    "in fact , work of this this flavor ( using more directly the isomorphism of @xmath11 and @xmath15/ \\theta$ ] in order to use additional properties of the toric variety ) has been done to investigate simplicial polytopes with certain simple symmetries , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
