    "the rosat x - ray source rxj1643.7 + 3402 ( aavso 1640 + 34 ) was identified as a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) by @xcite . based on spectroscopic and photometric data they classified this object as a member of the swsex family . in spite of their effort to determine its orbital period , two possible candidates from the power spectra of the  radial velocity curves , namely 2.575h and 2.885h , were suggested .",
    "in addition , they found a photometric period of 2.595h which they identified as a superhump modulation , as well as rapid variations in the @xmath5-band light curve with a time scale of @xmath6min .    in the same year , @xcite measured a reliable value for the orbital period , 2.89344(34)h , in agreement with one of the values suggested by @xcite .",
    "this places the system within the period gap , a region in the period distribution of cvs ( between approximately 2 and 3h ) in which a dearth of systems is observed . @xcite also reported two additional periodicities found in the light curve of rxj1643.7 + 3402 : 2.807h and 4.05d , which they interpret as a negative superhump and the wobble period of the accretion disc , respectively .",
    "moreover , a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) with a period near 17min ( very close to that previously reported by @xcite ) was also observed . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite confirmed the swsex membership of rxj1643.7 + 3402 on the basis of its spectroscopic behaviour and photometric variability .",
    "the swsex stars form a group of cvs firstly defined by @xcite . their original definition was later updated at the light of new observational and theoretical knowledge ( see e.g. martnez - pais , rodrguez - gil & casares 1999 , and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "briefly , ( i ) they show a strong absorption component in the balmer and hei lines usually detectable along a fraction of the orbit and reaching maximum depth around orbital phase @xmath7 , when it moves from positive to negative velocities .",
    "the relative intensity of this component increases with the line excitation level , even dominating the line profile in hei ; ( ii ) they also show a high - velocity emission s - wave which is stronger in the blue wing of the balmer lines and reaches its extreme negative velocity at orbital phase @xmath8 .",
    "( iii ) as a consequence of the complex structure of the emission lines , the balmer radial velocity curves are delayed with respect to the white dwarf motion .",
    "( iv ) most of them ( 68 percent , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cluster at the upper edge of the period gap with orbital periods in the range @xmath9h .",
    "the magnetic origin of the swsex phenomenology has been claimed by several authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was only after the discovery of variable circular polarisation in the non - eclipsing systems lspeg @xcite and v795her @xcite , and the x - ray pulsation in lspeg at exactly the polarimetric frequency ( baskill , wheatley & osborne @xcite ) , that the presence of a magnetic white dwarf has become a primary ingredient in defining the nature of this class of cv .",
    "rxj1643.7 + 3402 ( hereafter j1643 ) is the brightest non - eclipsing swsex star known ( and one of the brightest cvs at @xmath10 ) . this , together with the restrictive signal requirements of time - resolved spectropolarimetry ,",
    "make it the best candidate for probing the presence of a magnetic white dwarf by means of circular polarimetry measurements .",
    "besides , the lack of eclipses ensures an inclination angle small enough to guarantee a good visibility of the white dwarf along the whole orbital cycle .",
    "for this reasons we decided to undertake a spectropolarimetric study on this system similar to our pioneering work on lspeg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p01 ) , which provided a positive result : the detection of variable circular polarisation at a period of 29.6 ( @xmath11 ) min .",
    "two data sets ( spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric ) are presented in this paper .",
    "both were obtained using the blue arm of the intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) mounted on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at the roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma .",
    "spectra of cu - ne - ar comparison lamps were obtained every @xmath12min in order to secure an accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "data reduction was performed using iraf , while wavelength calibration and most of the subsequent analyses made use of tom marsh s molly package .",
    "regarding the pure spectroscopic data , a total of 114 spectra were acquired on 2002 may 21 using the r600b grating and a 1-arcsec slit width .",
    "this gave a spectral resolution of 1.7   ( full - width at half maximum , fwhm ) in the @xmath13 spectral range .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way , i.e. by applying bias and flat - field corrections , sky subtraction and the optimal extraction procedure described by @xcite . once the spectra were wavelength calibrated , their wavelength scale were re - sampled into an uniform velocity scale and then normalised to their continua .    the spectropolarimetric data ( 2003 july 1 )",
    "were acquired using a @xmath14/4 plate above the slit and a savart plate below it .",
    "this configuration produces two different images on the detector , corresponding to the ordinary and the extraordinary ray , respectively .",
    "the exposures were performed alternating two positions of the @xmath14/4 plate differing by 90 .",
    "a total of 44 images were acquired at each position angle of the quarterwave plate , each lasting between 120 and 150s .",
    "we used the r300b grating which covered the spectral range @xmath15 at a 3.4  resolution ) .",
    "reduction of the spectropolarimetric data was performed according to the procedure described in p01 .",
    "the extraction of the ordinary and extraordinary spectra from the images taken at both positions of the @xmath16 plate provided a total of @xmath17 spectra , from which the spectral density of the @xmath18 stokes parameter can be obtained following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the spectropolarimetric information contained in the 2003 data it is possible to recover the ( non - calibrated ) flux distribution by just co  adding the ordinary and extraordinary spectra on each frame .",
    "we therefore obtained a total of 88 spectra which were later re - binned and rectified in the same way as the 2002 data .",
    "once the @xmath19spectra were obtained ( see sect .  2 ) we measured the circular polarisation level on different continuum windows .",
    "@xmath19hjd curves were subsequently constructed for which scargle periodograms were computed .",
    "the best results ( i.e. the strongest peaks in the periodograms ) were found for redder continuum regions , especially in the range @xmath2059606850 after masking out the atmospheric and interstellar features .",
    "it must be noted , however , that no polarisation was detected in the emission lines . actually , neither  nor hei  @xmath146678 ( the lines included in the working range ) are present in the @xmath19 spectra .    ) curve for the @xmath215960 - 6850 wavelength range",
    ". also shown is the mean polarisation level obtained for the zero - polarisation star hd212311 @xcite .",
    "the scargle periodogram ( _ middle panel _ ) clearly shows a sharp peak centred at 74.3d@xmath22 exceeding the @xmath23 ( 99.99 per cent ) significance level .",
    "the data folded on this frequency and half this frequency are also shown ( _ bottom panels _ ; note that a whole cycle has been repeated for clarity ) .",
    "the phase origin corresponds to the first data point.,width=321 ]     +   +    in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarizacion ] we show the circular polarisation curve for the selected continuum region .",
    "the scargle periodogram @xcite is clearly dominated by a sharp peak at @xmath24d@xmath22 for which a gaussian fit yielded a frequency of @xmath25d@xmath22 ( a period of @xmath0 min ; the quoted uncertainty is half the fwhm of the fitting gaussian ) . in order to check the significance of this periodicity we performed a monte carlo test by generating @xmath26 white - noise time series , i.e. random , zero - mean normal distributions of data with the same sampling as our @xmath19 data .",
    "a scargle power spectrum was subsequently computed for each white - noise time series and an statistic was performed among them .",
    "thus , for example , the @xmath23 level indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : polarizacion ] is the power level for which 99.99 per cent of the computed power spectra have values below it .",
    "we can therefore say that the probability of a random time series having a peak in its periodogram exceeding this level is 0.01 per cent or , in other words , a peak having a power greater than this value has a probability of at least 99.99 per cent of being true .",
    "this unambiguous detection of variable circular polarisation in j1643 is a clear sign of magnetic accretion in the system .",
    "[ fig : polarizacion ] shows the circular polarisation data folded on both the 19.38-min period and twice that value .",
    "the reason for this will be explained in what follows .",
    "magnetic accretion can give rise to variations of the emission lines at a period related with that of the circular polarisation variability .",
    "this is the case in e.g. the intermediate polar cv ( ip ) pq gem @xcite , and the sw sex star ls peg ( p01 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : trailed ] we present the , , heii  @xmath144686 , hei  @xmath144922 , and  trailed spectra diagrams constructed from the pure spectroscopic data ( may 2002 ) and the spectropolarimetric data ( july 2003 ) after subtracting the continuum .",
    "emission - line flaring at a short time scale ( @xmath27min ) is clearly visible , especially in the 2002 data .",
    "apart from ls peg , these variations have been observed in the emission lines of other four swsex stars ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and are also seen in the optical spectra of other ips , such as foaqr @xcite . by analogy to ips , the emission - line flaring present in the swsex stars has been connected to the spin period of a magnetic white dwarf ( p01 , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to search for coherent signals in the lines of j1643 and to study a possible link with the circular polarisation period , we constructed radial velocity and equivalent width ( ew ) curves which were subjected to a period analysis .",
    "we will focus on the july 2003 spectropolarimetric data , as j1643 could have been on a different accretion state during the 2002 observations .",
    "nevertheless , we also analysed the 2002 radial velocity and ew curves for comparison .",
    "the radial velocities of the emission lines were obtained by cross - correlation of the line profile with a gaussian template having a fwhm similar to the line width .",
    "this technique provided better results ( i.e. stronger main peaks in the periodograms ) than the double - gaussian approach of @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvel_ew_scargle_2003 ] we show the heii  @xmath144686 , bowen blend , , and  scargle periodograms computed from the 2003 radial velocity and ew curves .",
    "the heii  @xmath144686 power spectra do not exhibit a peak at the circular polarisation frequency ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "instead , the radial velocities present the strongest peak ( @xmath29 ) at @xmath30 , which we identify with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the orbital frequency .",
    "the scargle periodogram of the heii  @xmath144686 ew curve is dominated by a peak centred at @xmath33 , which has a significance much in excess of the @xmath23 level .",
    "the fact that its frequency is almost exactly @xmath34 indicates that the circular polarisation is not modulated at the fundamental frequency , but the first harmonic of @xmath35 .",
    "this will we discussed in sect .",
    "[ discuss : periods ] .",
    "the periodogram of the bowen - blend velocities exhibits a peak very close to @xmath28 exceeding @xmath36 but not reaching the @xmath37 level . unlike heii  @xmath144686",
    ", no significant power is observed at either @xmath34 or @xmath31 . however , the bowen - blend ew curve produces a significant peak at @xmath34 but with less than half the power of the same peak in the heii  @xmath144686 ew periodogram .",
    "both the balmer radial velocity and ew curves are dominated by the orbital motion .",
    "the strongest peak in the  and  periodograms (  showed the same features and is not shown ) corresponds to twice the orbital frequency ( @xmath38 ) , and the second strongest is found at @xmath34 .",
    "note that the ew periodograms were computed from the ew curves after removing the orbital modulation to illustrate the effect of detrending .",
    "we have performed the same period analysis on the 2002 pure spectroscopic data .",
    "the scargle periodograms are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvel_ew_scargle_2002 ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the 2002 data portrait a different scenario .",
    "the heii  @xmath144686 radial velocities also show a significant peak at @xmath34 , but the strongest peak seen in 2003 at @xmath39 is absent .",
    "the @xmath34 frequency is also the dominant one in the balmer radial velocity periodograms ( only  is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rvel_ew_scargle_2002 ] ) after subtracting the original orbital modulation .",
    "the balmer velocities also show a peak very close to @xmath28 at @xmath40 . with regard to the bowen blend velocities ,",
    "a peak at @xmath41 shows power in excess of @xmath37 .",
    "the heii  @xmath144686 ews are dominated by a modulation at @xmath38 .",
    "the periodogram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvel_ew_scargle_2002 ] was constructed after removing the orbital modulation .",
    "the 2002 periodogram shows a cluster of peaks centred at @xmath42 , which we identify as @xmath34 .",
    "the flanking peaks are located at @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "their respective distances to the central one at @xmath34 are consistent with the orbital frequency ( @xmath45 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a peak at @xmath46 dominates the bowen blend ews , while one at @xmath47 is the strongest observed in the balmer ew periodograms .",
    "these are consistent , within the errors , with the peaks observed in the heii  @xmath144686 ew periodogram .",
    "the only frequency clearly common to both the 2002 and 2003 data sets is @xmath34 .",
    "the remaining ( i.e. @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) are not significant frequencies in the 2003 circular polarisation data . perhaps the most intuitive association would be @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . finally , we found no explanation for the @xmath53 frequency observed in the bowen radial velocities .",
    "several authors have provided clues of the presence of magnetic white dwarfs in the swsex stars ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "direct confirmation of magnetism in a particular system would require at least one of the two following observational facts : 1 ) the presence of coherent pulsations related to the white dwarf spin period and/or the orbital period and , mainly , 2 ) the detection of variable circular polarisation .",
    "the observation of modulated circular polarisation is an unambiguous proof as it implies the direct detection of a relatively strong magnetic field .",
    "it is clear from our results that the presence of an asynchronously rotating magnetic white dwarf in j1643 is beyond any doubt : the detection of variable circular polarisation and emission - line flaring ( which introduces oscillations in both the ews and the radial velocities ) are solid proofs .",
    "j1643 is therefore the second swsex star in which a magnetic white dwarf has been discovered by means of spectropolarimetric techniques .",
    "our discovery of the first swsex star showing modulated circular polarisation , ls peg , led us to propose a magnetic model ( p01 ) in which the periodicities found in the present work can be interpreted .",
    "briefly , due to the high accretion rate , the gas stream coming from the secondary star overflows the disc and hits the magnetosphere of the white dwarf , which is assumed to extend up to the corrotation radius . from this point on",
    ", the gas couples to the magnetic field lines , eventually shocking against the white dwarf surface and forming accretion columns above the magnetic poles .",
    "the resulting x - ray radiation irradiates other structures of the system which can reprocess the high energy radiation into optical wavelengths .",
    "for example , in the intermediate polar cvs periodicities at a frequency @xmath54 ( with @xmath4 the white dwarf spin frequency ) are usually detected due to the irradiation of structures anchored to the orbit ( disc , secondary star , etc ; @xcite ) .    according to our magnetic model , and by analogy with lspeg and intermediate polars",
    ", the emission lines should be flaring at @xmath55 as the white dwarf magnetosphere is connected to the overflown gas stream which provides information about the orbital motion .",
    "therefore , we would identify @xmath33 with @xmath55 .",
    "however , in this scenario the actual circular polarisation would be modulated at @xmath1 .",
    "this has two problems : first , the circular polarisation is not modulated at a fundamental frequency , but at a first harmonic ; and second , its frequency is related to @xmath54 , instead of @xmath4 .",
    "modulations at the first harmonic of the spin frequency have been observed in the _ bona fide _ intermediate polar cv , pqgem . in this system ,",
    "the relative dominance of the first harmonic with respect to the fundamental frequency depends on the wavelength range . in the x - ray regime , @xcite observed a dip at medium energies ( @xmath56 kev ) in their _ ginga _ data , which produced a double - humped light curve when folded on the spin frequency , @xmath4 .",
    "a periodogram of those data would therefore have provided the strongest peak at @xmath3 . in optical wavelengths",
    ", @xcite noticed that both the circular polarisation and the light curves were dominated by oscillations at @xmath3 towards red wavelengths .",
    "the authors explain the double - waved @xmath57-band circular polarisation curve as a dip in the negative circular polarisation due to absorption or scattering of the cyclotron emission by the gas stream . on the other hand ,",
    "the polar cv , v1432aql ( @xcite ) , shows the same phenomenology ( i.e. polarisation modulated at twice the white dwarf spin frequency ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this system is not synchronized , so it constitutes a valuable example to explain the evolution of magnetic cvs .",
    "@xcite interpret this periodicity as due to the double - peaked shape of the white dwarf spin - modulated curve .",
    "overall , these findings are not unexpected as cyclotron radiation dominates in the red and , therefore , interaction with the accretion structures can make this kind of behaviour more noticeable .",
    "the second problem is the most fundamental question : is @xmath58 in j1643 the actual spin frequency ( @xmath4 ) or the beat frequency ( @xmath54 ) ? with the data at hand and the lack of x - ray and ultraviolet light curves , and circular polarisation data in 2002 , answering to this question proves very difficult .",
    "although we can not rule ot a disc - fed configuration ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , the circular polarisation would be modulated at the beat period with two maxima and two minima per cycle , i.e. at @xmath59 , if our stream - fed model holds . in this regard",
    ", it is widely accepted that both the x - ray emission and the circular polarisation in intermediate polars show variation at the spin frequency ( or its first harmonic as we discussed above ) . but @xcite observed the x - ray emission of the intermediate polar v2400oph modulated at @xmath54 as a result of variable accretion rate with the rotation of the magnetic field . in our swsex magnetic model , accretion along the magnetic field lines on to the white dwarf surface only takes place when the field encounters the gas stream .",
    "therefore , optically - thick conditions for cyclotron radiation emission are only met every synodic period as seen by the gas stream . as a result , the circular polarisation can be varying at @xmath55 or its harmonics .    assuming a one solar - mass white dwarf",
    ", the corotation radius ( with @xmath60 s ) is @xmath61 km , and the corresponding free - fall velocity is @xmath62 kms@xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the timescale to refill the portion of the stream sweeped by the magnetic field is @xmath63 s , short enough to ensure that during the time elapsed between two consecutive passes of the field by the stream ( @xmath64 1000 s ) , it can be actually refilled .    in the described accretion scenario ,",
    "the white dwarf spin frequency would then be @xmath50 .",
    "peaks very close to this frequency ( @xmath29 ) are observed in both the heii  @xmath144686 and balmer periodograms constructed from the 2002 ew curves , but no sign of this frequency is found in the 2003 spectropolarimetric data .",
    "the different behaviour seen in the 2002 and 2003 data likely points to changes in the accretion mode in j1643 , and reflects the importance of spectropolarimetry : circular polarisation and emission - line variability can be compared as they are obtained simultaneously .",
    "imaging polarimetry can be the only way to measure fainter objects , but in that case , time - resolved spectroscopy has to be performed as close in time as possible to avoid data contamination by accretion mode changes .",
    "we have found significant circular polarisation levels modulated at a period of 19.4 ( @xmath65 ) min , which we interpret as half the beat period between the white dwarf spin period and the orbital period .",
    "in addition , the variation of the ews and radial velocities of the heii  @xmath144686 and balmer lines show a predominant period at the beat period .",
    "all this phenomenology confirms the presence of a magnetic white dwarf in j1643 , a characteristic that may be common to the swsex stars .",
    "the interpretation of the observed frequencies was based on our magnetic model of an overflowing gas stream striking the white dwarf s magnetosphere at approximately the corrotation radius , inside which the material accretes along the magnetic field lines . this model was also proposed by us for lspeg , another swsex star in which emission - line flaring and variable circular polarisation were also detected .",
    "however , in the case of j1643 , the frequency at which the polarisation varies can be @xmath1 , whilst for lspeg it is @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is also possible that the polarisation in j1643 is modulated at @xmath3 , while the ews are at @xmath4 .",
    "we are not able to address an unambiguous conclusion with the data presented in this paper .",
    "our results demonstrate that performing polarimetric measurements of other swsex stars is crucial to test the impact of magnetism within the class .",
    "specially interesting are non - eclipsing systems since , following our model , in eclipsing ones the disc may be intercepting the light coming from the regions near the white dwarf surface . however",
    ", the results will depend on the system geometry .",
    "in fact , several eclipsing systems are known to exhibit emission - line flaring ( btmon , dwuma ) and these should also be observed using polarimetric techniques .",
    "we thank pasi hakala , the referee , for a very constructive report on the paper . also thanks to tom marsh for the use of his molly package for time - series analysis of spectra .",
    "the william herschel telescope is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ."
