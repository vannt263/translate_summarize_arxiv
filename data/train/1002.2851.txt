    "there continues to be a great deal of interest in the investigation and manipulation of the spin degree of freedom of the charge carriers in semiconductor heterostructures with possible applications in the emerging field of spintronics@xcite .",
    "spintronics is based on manipulation of the spin degree of freedom of the carriers in order to develop functional mesoscopic devices with wide ranging applications , such as spin filters@xcite , spin field effect transistors@xcite , field effect switches@xcite , data storage@xcite , quantum computing@xcite and even biological sensors@xcite .",
    "the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom requires that we have control over the strength of spin - orbit interaction that couples the orbital motion of the electrons with the orientation of electron spins .",
    "it was first proposed by bychkov and rashba@xcite that in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) , that arises as a result of structural inversion asymmetry , the spin of finite momentum electrons feels a magnetic field perpendicular to the electron momentum in the inversion plane .",
    "both experimental as well as theoretical studies have shown that rsoi has an important role in semiconductor spintronic systems@xcite , since the strength of rsoi can be controlled by applying a gate voltage on top of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg)@xcite .",
    "in addition to the investigation of single particle properties in the presence of rsoi , there is also serious effort to examine the effects of rsoi on the collective properties of semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "single particle magneto - oscillatory phenomena such as the shubnikov - de haas and de haas - van alphen effects have been important in probing the electronic structure of solids .",
    "their collective analog yields important insights into collective phenomena . in a 2deg",
    ", collective excitations are induced by electron - electron interactions . these collective excitations ( plasmons )",
    "are among the most important electronic properties of a system . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "these collective excitations are known as magnetoplasmons .",
    "magnetic oscillations of the plasmon frequency occur in a magnetic field . in this regard",
    ", there have been recent studies of collective excitations ( plasmons ) of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems realized in semiconductor heterostructures in the presence of rsoi with and without an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the presence of rsoi mixes the spin up and spin down states of neighboring landau levels with the result that two new , unequally spaced branches arise .",
    "given the importance rsoi has acquired , it is important to investigate the effects of rsoi on the magnetoplasmons of a modulated 2deg . in the absence of rsoi but as a result of modulation , weiss@xcite oscillations in the magnetoplasmon spectrum appear@xcite .",
    "these oscillations are due to the commensurability of two characteristic length scales of the system : the cyclotron diameter at the fermi level and the period of the electric modulation .",
    "weiss oscillations are distinctly different from the shubnikov - de hass ( sdh)@xcite oscillations that appear at higher magnetic field strengths .",
    "the period of weiss oscillations depends on both the modulation period and the square root of the number density of the 2deg , in contrast to the linear dependence on the number density of the sdh oscillations .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of weiss oscillations is weakly affected by temperature as compared to sdh oscillations .",
    "theoretical study of rsoi effects on single particle quantum transport in a modulated 2deg was recently carried out@xcite , where modulation leads to the broadening of the levels of two unequally spaced branches into bands whose widths oscillate as a function of magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , recently rsoi effects on magnetoplasmon excitations without modulation have been addressed@xcite but rsoi effects on commensurability oscillations in magnetoplasmons of a m2deg have not been discussed so far .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the present work examines rsoi effects on the collective excitations ( magnetoplasmons ) of a modulated 2deg .",
    "this investigation is performed within the self - consistent - field approach at finite temperature .",
    "we analyze the dynamic , nonlocal dielectric function of the system and highlight the modulation - induced effects on the intra - landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum in the presence of rsoi .",
    "in addition , our finite temperature theory facilitates analysis of effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmon spectrum of a m2deg in the presence of rsoi as there is an apparent gap in the literature@xcite regarding finite temperature effects on the magnetoplasmon spectrum of a m2deg even in the absence of rsoi .",
    "we expect experimental studies such as in - elastic light scattering@xcite and spectroscopic@xcite measurements of magnetoplasmons spectrum of a modulated system in the presence of rsoi would allow verification of the model presented here and would be quite revealing as they pertain to spin - orbit interaction effects on the many - body properties of a 2deg .",
    "our system is a modulated two - dimensional electron gas ( m2deg ) in the presence of  an external magnetic field and rsoi .",
    "the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the @xmath0 plane in which electrons with unmodulated areal density @xmath1 , effective mass @xmath2 and charge @xmath3 are confined .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5  is the unmodulated and @xmath6 the modulation term .",
    "we employ the landau gauge and write the vector potential as @xmath7 . the two - dimensional schrodinger equation in the landau gauge is@xcite ; @xmath8_{z}+\\frac{1}{2}g\\mu_{b}b\\sigma_{z } , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the momentum operator of the electrons , @xmath10 the zeeman factor , @xmath11  the bohr magneton , @xmath12  the pauli spin matrices , @xmath13  the strength of the rsoi with @xmath14 @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the period of modulation and @xmath17 the amplitude of modulation .",
    "since the hamiltonian does not depend on the @xmath18 coordinate , the unperturbed wavefunctions are plane waves in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "this allows us to write for the wavefunctions , @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the normalization length in the @xmath18-direction and @xmath21 a 2d position vector on the @xmath22-@xmath18 plane , @xmath23 is the coordinate of cyclotron orbit center and @xmath24 is the magnetic length , @xmath2 is the effective mass . in the @xmath22-direction , the hamiltonian has the form of a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "hence , we can write the unmodulated eigenstates in the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a normalized harmonic oscillator wavefunction centered at @xmath28 and @xmath29 are hermite polynomials with @xmath30 the landau level quantum number .",
    "the energy of the lowest landau level is @xmath31 with wave function @xmath32 for @xmath33 , there are two branches of levels , denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with energies @xmath36^{1/2}. \\label{5}\\ ] ] the @xmath34 branch is described by the wave function @xmath37  and @xmath35 one by  @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40.$ ]    in the presence of modulation , the hamiltonian is augmented by the term @xmath41 in this work , we consider the modulation to be weak such that it is about an order of magnitude smaller than fermi energy ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "hence , we may employ first order ( in @xmath43 perturbation theory in the evaluation of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "the energy eigenvalues in the presence of modulation and taking into account rsoi are@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45/a_{n},$ ] @xmath46/a_{n},u=\\frac { k^{2}l^{2}}{2}=(\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^{2}\\frac{\\hslash}{2m^{\\ast}\\omega_{c}},$]and @xmath47 is a laguerre polynomial .",
    "the above equation shows that the formerly sharp landau levels are now broadened into minibands by the modulation potential .",
    "furthermore , the landau bandwidths oscillate as a function of @xmath30 , since @xmath47 is an oscillatory function of its index .",
    "these landau bands become flat for different values of @xmath48 .",
    "flat bands occur for those values of @xmath48 for which modulation strength becomes zero . by putting @xmath49=0",
    "$ ] one can get the flat band condition using the asymptotic expression@xcite @xmath50 @xmath51and @xmath52with @xmath1 being the electron density , one obtains the following condition @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 the cyclotron radius without rsoi , the upper and lower sign corresponds to the @xmath56  branch , @xmath57 is the classical cyclotron orbit . from eq . @xmath58",
    "it can be observed that , in the large @xmath30 limit electron bandwidth oscillates sinusoidally and is periodic in @xmath59 for fixed values of @xmath30 and @xmath60when @xmath30 is small bandwidth still oscillates , but the condition @xmath58 no longer holds because neither eq .",

    "weiss oscillations are suppressed and shubnikov de haas ( sdh ) oscillations are the dominant magnetic oscillations .",
    "sdh type of oscillations result from the emptying out of electrons from successive landau bands when they pass through the fermi level as the magnetic field is increased for a fixed value of rsoi .",

    "they oscillate at different frequencies and their linear combination results in the observed beating pattern of weiss oscillations .",
    "furthermore , since the flat band condition depends on the strength of rsoi , the amplitude and phase of the magnetic oscillations ( weiss and sdh ) vary with the strength of rsoi .",
    "fig ( 3 ) shows the effect of temperature on the magnetoplasmon spectrum while taking into account rsoi .",
    "as the temperature is increased from 0.25 k to 1 k , comparing figs.(2 ) @xmath140 ( 3 ) , we see that the beating pattern in weiss oscillations of the plasmon spectrum is still present but damped .",

    "damping of the plasmon energy with temperature can be explicitly seen if the derivative of the fermi functions appearing in the above expression are expressed as follows : @xmath142 with @xmath143",
    "we have determined the intra - landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum for a modulated two dimensional electron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field and rsoi employing the scf approach at finite temperature .",
    "the magnetoplasmon spectrum of the modulated two - dimensional electron gas system is found to exhibit beating of weiss oscillations due to rashba effect as a function of the inverse magnetic field  in the regime of low magnetic field , the modulation induced weiss oscillations show beating pattern whose period is determined by the period of electric modulation and the strength of rsoi .",
