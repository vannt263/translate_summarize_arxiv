    "in strongly correlated electron systems , both local and non - local interactions are important in determining the nature of the ground state and low lying excitations .",

    "the interplay between local and non - local interactions is also essential in mott - hubbard systems@xcite .",
    "when on - site interactions are strong , their effects can be thought of as determining the atomic configurations that lie at low energies .",
    "the precise form of the ground state and low - lying excitations , on the other hand , have to be determined by the residual intersite couplings between these low energy configurations .",
    "in general , a separation of electron - electron interactions into local and non - local ones is not necessarily well - defined .",
    "local interactions , when combined with kinetic terms , can lead to effective non - local interactions .",

    ", we are concerned with the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite which is formally exact in the limit of infinite dimensions ( @xmath0)@xcite . the dmft reduces a correlated lattice problem to a self - consistent anderson impurity model , namely a quantum impurity coupled to a self - consistent fermionic bath .",
    "the interactions between the impurity degrees of freedom reflect the on - site interactions of the lattice problem ; in this way local quantum fluctuations are retained . the self - consistent fermionic bath of the impurity problem reflects the influence , at the one - particle level , of the rest of the lattice on the selected ( i.e. , impurity ) site .",

    "this extended dmft reduces a correlated lattice problem into a novel effective impurity problem , which corresponds to an anderson impurity model with additional self - consistent bosonic baths .",
    "these bosonic baths reflect the influence , at the two - particle level , of the rest of the lattice on the impurity site . through self - consistency , they keep track of the intersite quantum fluctuations . in these earlier works ,",

    "the purpose of this paper is to give an alternative formulation of this extended dmft using perturbation methods .",

    "the coupling of the impurity to this frequency - dependent weiss field can be equivalently described in terms of a coupling between the impurity and an effective non - interacting fermionic bath .",
    "the bath is fermionic , since the weiss field describes the influence of the rest of sites to the selected impurity site at the one - particle level . on the other hand , the intersite interaction terms ( both @xmath13 and @xmath14 )",
    "are taken to be of order @xmath1 .",
    "with such scaling , only the static hartree contributions survive the large @xmath10 limit@xcite .",
    "all the quantum fluctuations associated with these interactions are then neglected .",
    "in the extended dmft , these intersite interaction terms are also scaled to the order @xmath11 .",
    "the large @xmath10 limit then leads to a different effective impurity problem : the impurity is now also coupled to the frequency - dependent weiss field induced by these intersite interactions .",

    "consider , for example , the spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic phase of a mott insulator . in the standard large @xmath10 limit , these fluctuations reflect simply isolated local moments : they contain no damping and are featureless in momentum space .",
