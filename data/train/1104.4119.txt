    "finally the third mode implements a pixellized linear reconstruction of the source plane light distribution while fitting for the non - linear potential parameters @xcite ; we did not consider the latter mode here as its computational cost is prohibitive for the large images and complex gravitational potential of this system .",
    "the lensing potential is assumed to be made of a cored isothermal ellipsoid , centered on the main deflector galaxy g1 , and that is supposed to capture the lensing contribution of the dark matter halo as well as the stellar component of g1 .",
    "given the absence of a radial arc or central demagnified images ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the details of the assumed potential in the innermost parts ( @xmath32 ) of the lens should not be important .",

    "the convergence profile of the central mass component is given by @xmath33 where the scaling parameter @xmath34 is related to the velocity dispersion of the deflector through @xmath35 , the core radius is @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the radial coordinate that accounts for the ellipsoidal symmetry of the isodensity contours and @xmath38 is the minor - to - major axis ratio . the orientation of the major axis , @xmath39 , relative to the @xmath40-axis is allowed to vary , although this is not explicit in the definition of @xmath41 . as will be seen below , lens modeling of extended images can yield formal errors on @xmath42 of order one percent , and therefore similar errors on @xmath43 . however , here we propagate uncertainties in @xmath44 due to the relatively poorly known lens redshift ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this results in a dominant additional 3% error that we add in quadrature to model uncertainties on @xmath42 , keeping in mind that a spectroscopic measurement of @xmath45 would readily reduce lens modeling errors on @xmath43 to the percent level .",
    "we carefully account for the perturbing galaxies g2 , g3 , g4 and the more distant g5 , and model them as truncated isothermal ellipsoids , each with a free velocity dispersion and a constant cutoff radius that we fix to a value of @xmath46 corresponding to @xmath47 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the 3% quoted errors are dominated by the uncertainty in the photometric redshift of the lens , but this is still negligible compared to the uncertainty in the velocity dispersion of the main component . as an approximation , we match the ellipticity and orientation of these perturbing systems to that of the stars they host , although we note that recent analyses have shown that departures from this simple assumption might occur and is sometimes observed with more favorable lensing configurations and deep space - based optical data@xcite .    to summarize",
    ", the lensing potential is described by 4 parameters for the central component : @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath52 , @xmath39 and we also allow the 4 scaling parameters @xmath53 of the perturbing potentials to vary .",
    "we first attempted to fit the model parameters of the main central component assuming that the source is point - like ( first mode of sl_fit ) and the perturbers have a negligible effect . by ignoring the effect of g4 we had to neglect the additionally produced image 1b and just considered the brightest pixel of each of the images 1a , 2 , 3 and 4 as input constraints on the potential .",
    "we performed a fit to the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath39 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",

    "we ran a monte - carlo markov chain sampler of the posterior distribution of the 8 model parameters related to the gravitational potential . at this stage",

    "<S> we measure the half - light radius @xmath2 of the source in the rest - frame near - uv and @xmath3 bands that characterize the unobscured light coming from stars and find @xmath4 { \\ , { \\rm kpc}}$ ] , in good agreement with recent studies on the sub - millimeter galaxies population . </S>",
