    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) mark the violent death of massive stars .",
    "it is believed that the initial collapse of a star s iron core results in the formation of a proto - neutron star and the launch of a hydrodynamic shock wave .",
    "the latter , however , fails to immediately explode the star , but stalls and must be _ revived _ by a yet - uncertain supernova `` mechanism '' on a @xmath0@xmath1 timescale to explode the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the shock is not revived , a black hole is formed and no or only a very weak explosion results ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if the shock is revived , it reaches the stellar surface and produces the spectacular electromagnetic display of a type ii or type ib / c supernova .",
    "the type classification is based on the explosion light curve and spectrum , which depend largely on the nature of the progenitor star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the time from core collapse to breakout of the shock through the stellar surface and first supernova light is minutes to days , depending on the radius of the progenitor and energy of the explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "any core collapse event generates a burst of neutrinos that releases most of the proto - neutron star s gravitational binding energy ( @xmath2 ) on a timescale of order @xmath3  seconds .",
    "this neutrino burst was detected from sn 1987a and confirmed the basic theory of ccsne @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are emitted by aspherical mass - energy dynamics that includes quadrupole or higher - order contributions .",
    "such asymmetric dynamics are expected to be present in the pre - explosion stalled - shock phase of ccsne and may be crucial to the ccsn explosion mechanism ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gws can serve as probes of the magnitude and character of these asymmetries and thus may help in constraining the ccsn mechanism @xcite .",
    "stellar collapse and ccsne were considered as potential sources of detectable gws already for resonant bar detectors in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "early analytic and semi - analytic estimates of the gw signature of stellar collapse and ccsne ( e.g. , @xcite ) gave optimistic signal strengths , suggesting that first - generation laser interferometer detectors could detect gws from ccsne in the virgo cluster ( at distances @xmath4 ) .",
    "modern detailed multi - dimensional ccsn simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the reviews in @xcite ) find gw signals of short duration ( @xmath5 ) and emission frequencies in the most sensitive @xmath0@xmath6 band of ground based laser interferometer detectors . predicted total emitted gw energies are in the range @xmath7 for emission mechanisms and progenitor parameters that are presently deemed realistic .",
    "these numbers suggest that the early predictions were optimistic and that even second - generation laser interferometers ( operating from 2015@xmath8 ) such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , and kagra @xcite will only be able to detect gws from very nearby ccsne at @xmath9 . only our own milky way and the magellanic clouds are within that range .",
    "the expected event rate is very low and estimated to @xmath10 @xcite .    however , there are also a number of analytic and semi - analytic gw emission models of more extreme scenarios , involving non - axisymmetric rotational instabilities , centrifugal fragmentation , and accretion disk instabilities .",
    "the emitted gw signals may be sufficiently strong to be detectable to much greater distances of @xmath11 , perhaps even with first - generation laser interferometers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these emission scenarios require special and rare progenitor characteristics , but they can not presently be strictly ruled out on theoretical grounds . in a sphere of radius @xmath12 centered on earth ,",
    "the ccsn rate is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this makes virgo cluster ccsne interesting targets for constraining extreme gw emission scenarios .",
    "previous observational constraints on gw burst sources applicable to ccsne come from all - sky searches for short - duration gw burst signals @xcite .",
    "these searches did not target individual astrophysical events .",
    "targeted searches have the advantage over all - sky searches that potential signal candidates in the data streams have to arrive in a well - defined temporal _ on - source window _ and have to be consistent with coming from the sky location of the source . both constraints",
    "can significantly reduce the noise background and improve the sensitivity of the search ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous targeted gw searches have been carried out for gamma - ray bursts @xcite , soft - gamma repeater flares @xcite , and pulsar glitches @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite confirmed that targeted searches with advanced ligo and virgo at design sensitivity should be able to detect neutrino - driven ccsne out to several kiloparsecs and rapidly rotating ccsne out to tens of kiloparsecs , while more extreme gw emission scenarios will be detectable to several megaparsecs .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first targeted search for gws from ccsne using the first - generation initial ligo ( iligo )  @xcite , geo600  @xcite , and virgo  @xcite laser interferometer detectors .",
    "the data searched were collected over 20052011 in the s5 , a5 , and s6 runs of the iligo and geo600 detectors , and in the vsr1vsr4 runs of the virgo detector . from the set of ccsne observed in this period @xcite , we make a preliminary selection of four targets for our search : sne  2007gr , 2008ax , 2008bk , and 2011dh .",
    "these ccsne exploded in nearby galaxies ( @xmath14 ) , have well constrained explosion dates , and at least partial coverage by coincident observation of more than one interferometer .",
    "sne 2008ax and 2008bk occurred in the _ astrowatch _",
    "( a5 ) period between the s5 and s6 iligo science runs . in a5 , the principal goal was detector commissioning , not data collection .",
    "data quality and sensitivity were not of primary concern .",
    "preliminary analyses of the gravitational - wave data associated with sne 2008ax and 2008bk showed that the sensitivity was much poorer than the data for sne  2007gr and 2011dh .",
    "because of this , we exclude sne 2008ax and 2008bk and focus our search and analysis on sne  2007gr and 2011dh .",
    "we find no evidence for gw signals from sne  2007gr or 2011dh in the data .",
    "using gravitational waveforms from ccsn simulations , waveforms generated with phenomenological astrophysical models , and _ ad - hoc _ waveforms , we measure the sensitivity of our search .",
    "we show that none of the considered astrophysical waveforms would likely be detectable at the distances of sne  2007gr and 2011dh for the first - generation detector networks .",
    "furthermore , even a very strong gravitational wave could potentially be missed due to incomplete coverage of the ccsn on - source window by the detector network .",
    "motivated by this , we provide a statistical approach for model exclusion by combining observational results for multiple ccsne . using this approach",
    ", we quantitatively estimate how increased detector sensitivity and a larger sample of targeted ccsne will improve our ability to rule out the most extreme emission models .",
    "this suggests that observations with second - generation `` advanced '' interferometers @xcite will be able to put interesting constraints on gw emission of extragalactic ccsn at @xmath15 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ccsne ] , we discuss the targeted ccsne and the determination of their on - source windows . in section",
    "[ sec : networks ] , we describe the detector networks , the coverage of the on - source windows with coincident observation , and the data searched . in section",
    "[ sec : overview ] , we present our search methodology and the waveform models studied .",
    "we present the search results in section  [ sec : results ] and conclusions in section  [ sec : summaries ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , < , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table : res ]      as we have seen , it is unlikely that we will have coincident science - quality data covering an entire multi - day on - source window for any given ccsn . in the present analysis , the coverage of the on - source windows is approximately 93% for sn  2007gr and 37% for sn  2011dh . considering that data - quality cuts typically remove another few percent of livetime , we can not expect to exclude even fairly strong gw emission at the 90% confidence level for a single ccsn .",
    "however , by combining observations of multiple ccsne , it is straightforward to exclude the simple model in which all ccsne produce identical gw signals ; i.e. , assuming _ standard - candle _ emission .",
    "consider a ccsn model @xmath16 which predicts a particular gw emission pattern during the ccsn event ( e.g. , one of the waveforms considered in section  [ sec : simulations ] ) . in the case that no gw candidates are observed ,",
    "we can constrain that model using observations from multiple ccsn events at known distances @xmath17 using the measured detection efficiencies @xmath18 for each supernova ( e.g. , as in figure  [ fig : sn2007gr ] ) .",
    "these @xmath18 can be combined into an overall model exclusion probability  @xcite , @xmath19 : p _ = 1 - _ i = 1^n ( 1-_i(d_i ) ) [ eq : reach ] it is also straightforward to marginalize over uncertainties in the @xmath17 ( as in table  [ table : triggers ] ) by the replacement @xmath20 where @xmath21 is our prior on the distance to ccsn @xmath22 ( e.g. , a gaussian ) .    in the light of the measured sensitivity",
    "ranges in figures  [ fig : sn2007gr ] and [ fig : sn2011dh ] , it is clear that we can not exclude any of the considered models of gw emission for sn  2007gr and sn  2011dh with the current data .",
    "however , iligo and virgo are being upgraded to advanced configurations , with a final design sensitivity approximately a factor of ten better than for the period 2005 - 2011 considered in this paper .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider what model exclusion statements the advanced detectors will be able to make using future ccsne similar to sn  2007gr and sn  2011dh .",
    "we will focus on the phenomenological waveform models of plausible but more extreme gw emission , where we expect to reach sooner large standard candle model exclusion probabilities . specifically",
    ", we analyze the rotating bar and torus fragmentation scenarios ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .    figure  [ fig : exclusion ] presents model exclusion confidence plots for four of the phenomenological waveform models .",
    "these plots are based on the measured efficiencies for sn  2007gr and sn  2011dh , but assume the detector noise spectra have been lowered by a factor of @xmath23 , so the search would be expected to have the same efficiency for a particular source at @xmath23-times the distance , and the number of ccsne in the sample has been increased by a factor of @xmath24 . for example , @xmath25 represents having a sensitivity 10 times better than the 20052011 data , which is realistic for advanced ligo and advanced virgo , while @xmath26 corresponds to having two ccsne similar to sn  2007gr and two similar to sn  2011dh .",
    "the curves correspond to the experimentally derived values based on the 2005 - 2011 data set .",
    "it is worth stressing that the power of excluding models from this data set almost exclusively originates from sn  2007gr , given the more sensitive interferometers available at the time of that supernova .",
    "for example , in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] , the curves , when a is smaller than 9 , depend almost exclusively on the contribution of sn  2007gr . in this",
    "regard , the presented model exclusion probabilities will be reached with less than @xmath27 ccsne if the sample contains more data sets comparable in coverage and sensitivity to the rescaled sn  2007gr data set than a rescaled sn  2011dh data set . in summary , fig .  [",
    "fig : exclusion ] shows that it is a reasonable expectation that extended coincident observations with advanced - generation detectors will rule out extreme ccsn emission models .                  as noted in section  [ sec : introduction ] , targeted searches have the advantage over all - time all - sky searches that potential signal candidates in the data streams have to arrive in a well - defined temporal on - source window and have to be consistent with coming from the sky location of the source .",
    "both constraints can significantly reduce the noise background . here",
    "we assess the improved sensitivity of a triggered search by comparing our @xmath28 sensitivities to linearly polarized sine - gaussian waveforms for sn  2007gr to those of an all - sky search of the same data .    the most straightforward way to compare two searches is to fix the far threshold and compare the @xmath28 values at 50% efficiency .",
    "the s5/vsr1 all - sky all - time search @xcite using cwb was run on 68.2 days of coincident h1h2l1v1 data with thresholds to give a fap of 0.1 or less in the frequency band up to 2000hz .",
    "the livetime for the cwb sn  2007gr analysis of the h1h2l1v1 network was 3.25 days , so a fap of 0.1 corresponds to a far of @xmath29hz . including calibration and monte carlo uncertainties , the @xmath30 values at 50% efficiency for this far are @xmath31 at 235hz and @xmath32 at 1304hz . after adjusting for systematic differences in the antenna responses and noise spectra between the s5/vsr1 all - sky search and the sn  2007gr search ,",
    "the effective all - sky @xmath30 values are @xmath33 at 235hz and @xmath34 at 1304hz , approximately 30% to 40% higher than the targeted search .",
    "equivalently , the distance reach of our targeted search is larger than that of the all - time all - sky search by 30% to 40% at this fap .",
    "alternatively , we can compare the two searches without adjusting to a common far .",
    "after allowing for systematic differences in the antenna responses and noise spectra between the s5/vsr1 all - sky search and the sn  2007gr search , we find that the @xmath30 values at 50% efficiency are identical ( to within a few percent ) .",
    "however , the far of the sn  2007gr search is lower by an order of magnitude : @xmath35hz compared to @xmath36hz for the all - sky search .",
    "this is consistent with expectations for restricting from an all - sky search to a single sky - position search .",
    "furthermore , the fap for a trigger produced by the sn  2007gr search will be smaller than that of a trigger from the all - sky search at the same far because the sn  2007gr on - source window ( 3.5 days for cwb and x - pipeline combined ) is a factor of 20 shorter than the all - sky window ( 68.2 days ) .",
    "so if we consider a surviving trigger that is just above threshold in the two searches , the sn  2007gr trigger will have an fap a factor of approximately 200 lower than an all - sky trigger with the same @xmath28 .",
    "we presented the results of the first iligo - geo - virgo search for gravitational - wave ( gw ) transients in coincidence with optically detected core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) observed between 2007 and 2011 .",
    "two ccsne , sn  2007gr and sn  2011dh , satisfied our criteria of proximity , well - constrained time of core collapse , and occurrence during times of coincident high - sensitivity operation of at least two gw detectors .",
    "no statistically significant gw events were observed associated with either ccsn .",
    "we quantified the sensitivity of the search as a function of distance to the ccsne using both representative waveforms from detailed multi - dimensional ccsn simulations and from semi - analytic phenomenological models of plausible but extreme emission scenarios .",
    "the distances out to which we find signals detectable for sne 2007gr and 2011dh range from @xmath37kpc for waveforms from detailed simulations to @xmath38mpc for the more extreme phenomenological models . from the known distances of our two target supernovae",
    ", we estimated the minimum energy in gravitational waves corresponding to our sensitivity limits using _ ad - hoc _ sine - gaussian waveforms . these range from @xmath39 at low frequencies to @xmath40 above 1khz .",
    "this first search for gws from extragalactic ccsne places the most stringent observational constraints to - date on gw emission in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "a comparison of our search s sensitivity with the standard all - sky , all - time search for generic gw bursts in the same gw detector data shows a 35%-40% improvement in distance reach at fixed false alarm probability .",
    "this improvement comes from knowledge of the sky positions of the ccsne and approximate knowledge of the collapse times .",
    "it is , hence , clearly beneficial to carry out targeted searches for gws from ccsne .",
    "the results of our search do not allow us to constrain astrophysically meaningful gw emission scenarios .",
    "we have extrapolated our results to the sensitivity level expected for advanced ligo and virgo .",
    "considering the improved detector sensitivity and assuming the analysis of multiple ccsne , we find that at design sensitivity ( c.  2019 , @xcite ) this network will be able to constrain the extreme phenomenological emission models for extragalactic ccsne observed out to distances of @xmath010mpc .",
    "detection of the most realistic gw signals predicted by multi - dimensional ccsn simulations will require a galactic event even at the design sensitivity of the advanced detectors .",
    "these are consistent with the results of the study in @xcite , which used data from iligo and virgo recoloured to match the advanced detector design sensitivities .",
    "we conclude that third - generation detectors with a sensitivity improvement of a factor of @xmath41 over the advanced detectors may be needed to observe gws from extragalactic ccsne occurring at a rate of @xmath42 per year within @xmath010mpc .",
