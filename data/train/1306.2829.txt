    "the more important parameter is the area of a pulse",
    ". therefore , a reasonably smooth temporal profile will be sufficient .",
    "the effective impulse from the pulse changes the atomic momentum by @xmath131 , where @xmath132 should be large enough for us to neglect atomic motion during @xmath44 , yet small enough to neglect effects arising from quadratic zeeman shifts . the above conditions seem challenging , yet remain within reach of current experimental setups of cold atoms .",
    "although the present discussion on the validity of our effective hamiltonian containing soc is at the single - particle or single - mode ( condensate ) level , every step along the way for our protocols can be justified more generally for the many - body spinor atom system with contact interactions and in a trapping potential .",
    "in conclusion , we present a scheme of realizing an effective pure rashba or dresselhaus soc by using magnetic - field - gradient pulses . due to the noncommuting property between momentum and position operators , by applying @xmath24- and @xmath25-dependent magnetic - field pulses alternatively , we can create a pure rashba - type soc . by monitoring the single atom motion at both the semiclassical and quantum levels , and also the dynamics of a spin-1 condensate , we confirm that our protocols are valid and practical within current experimental technology .",
    "the dresselhaus - type soc can be realized by applying two pulses from a single 2dqt , where an effective hamiltonian involving non - abalian gauge fields approximately emulates the dresselhaus - type soc in the limit of small pulse areas .",
    "our scheme can help develop more general protocols that synthesize gauge fields of various types .",
