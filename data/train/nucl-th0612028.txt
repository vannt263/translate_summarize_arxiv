    "the gdr @xmath6-component ( gdr@xmath7 ) is the isobaric analog of the charge - exchange ( in the @xmath8-channel ) giant dipole resonance ( i.e. of the gdr@xmath9 ) .",

    "being motivated by these experimental results , which are still not explained , in the present work we attempt to describe the gross and ( direct ) decay properties of isolated diar within a continuum - rpa(crpa)-based approach .",

    "the dipole isobaric analog resonances in a target nucleus @xmath13 correspond to ( 2particle-2hole)-type excitations with a small admixture of ( proton-(proton - hole))-type states .",
    "namely due to this admixture , e1-decay of the diar into the target - nucleus ground state and also ( direct ) proton decays into one - hole states of the product nucleus @xmath14 are possible .",
    "the description of the diar properties is simplified , provided that the isobaric analog state ( ias ) is considered as the `` ideal '' one .",
