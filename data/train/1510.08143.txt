    "flares are energetic explosions in the stellar atmosphere , and are thought to occur by intense releases of magnetic energy stored around starspots , like solar flares ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * shibata & magara 2011 ) ) .",
    "superflares are flares 10@xmath110@xmath2 times more energetic ( @xmath110@xmath3erg ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schaefer et al . 2000 ) ) than the largest solar flares ( @xmath110@xmath4erg ) .",
    "recently , we analyzed the data of the kepler space telescope ( ( * ? ? ? * koch et al .",
    "2010 ) ) , and discovered more than 1000 superflares on a few hundred solar - type ( g - type main - sequence ) stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maehara et al . 2012 ) , @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shibayama et al . 2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* candelaresi et al . 2014 ) ) .",
    "we here define solar - type stars as the stars that have a surface temperature of @xmath5k and a surface gravity of @xmath6 .",
    "+  with these data , we studied the statistical properties of the occurrence rate of superflares , and found that the occurrence rate ( @xmath7 ) of the superflare versus the flare energy ( @xmath8 ) has a power - law distribution of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maehara et al . 2012 ) , @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shibayama et al . 2013 ) ) , and this distribution is roughly similar to that for the solar flare .",
    "+  many of the superflare stars show quasi - periodic brightness variations with a typical period of from one day to a few tens of days .",
    "the amplitude of these brightness variations is in the range of 0.1 - 10% ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maehara et al . 2012 ) ) , and is much larger than that of the solar brightness variation ( 0.01 - 0.1% ) caused by the existence of sunspots on the rotating solar surface .",
    "@xcite showed that the above brightness variations of superflare stars can be well explained by the rotation of a star with fairly large starspots , taking into account the effects of inclination angle and the spot latitude .",
    "+  @xcite compared the superflare energy and frequency with the rotation period , assuming that the brightness variation corresponds to the rotation .",
    "they then found slowly rotating stars can still produce as energetic flares as those of more rapidly rotating stars , though the average flare frequency is lower for more slowly rotating stars .",
    "@xcite also clarified that the superflare energy is related to the total coverage of the starspots , and that the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored around these large starspots .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested , on the basis of theoretical estimates , that the sun can generate large magnetic flux sufficient for causing superflares with an energy of @xmath11 erg within one solar cycle .",
    "+   the results described above are , however , only based on kepler monochromatic photometric data . we need to spectroscopically investigate whether these brightness variations are explained by the rotation , and whether superflare stars have large starspots . the stellar parameters and the binarity of the superflare stars are also needed to be investigated with spectroscopic observations in order to discuss whether the sun can really generate superflares .",
    "we have then performed high - dispersion spectroscopy of superflares stars ( 50 stars in total ) .",
    "we describe the results of this observation in the following .",
    "in this observation , we observed 50 solar - type superflare stars by using high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; ( * ? ? ? * noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) ) at the 8.2 m subaru telescope on 6 nights during 2011@xmath12013 ( ( * ? ? ? * notsu et al .",
    "2013a ) , @xcite & @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nogami et al . 2014 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* honda et al . 2015 ) ) .",
    "these 50 target stars were selected from superflare stars reported by our previous researches ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * shibayama et al .",
    "spectroscopic resolution ( @xmath12 ) of each observation date is @xmath13 .",
    "the wavelength range is 6100@xmath18800 .",
    "this range includes ca ii near - ir triplet ( 8498/8542/8662 ) and h@xmath14 ( 6563 ) , which are well - known indicators of stellar chromospheric activity .",
    "more details of the observations and the target stars are described in @xcite .",
    "as a result of the observations , we found more than half ( 34 stars ) of our 50 targets have no evidence of binary system ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* notsu et al .",
    "2015a ) ) . among the remaining 16 stars ,",
    "12 stars show double line profiles or radial velocity shifts , which are expected be caused by the orbital motion of binary system .",
    "the other 4 stars have visual companion stars .",
    "+  we then estimated effective temperature ( @xmath15 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath16 ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and projected rotation velocity ( @xmath0 ) of these 34  single \" superflare stars on the basis of our spectroscopic data ( ( * ? ? ? * notsu et al . 2015a ) ) .",
    "we here estimated @xmath0 by measuring doppler broadening of photospheric lines taking into account macroturbulence and insturumental broadening ( cf .",
    "* takeda et al . 2008 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* notsu et al . 2015a ) ) .",
    "+  we confirmed that stellar atmospheric parameters ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and [ fe / h ] ) of the 34 target stars are roughly in the range of ordinary solar - type ( g - type main sequence ) stars .",
    "in particular , the temperature , surface gravity , and brightness variation period ( @xmath17 ) of 9 stars are in the range of  sun - like \" stars ( @xmath18k , @xmath194.0 , and @xmath2010 days ) .",
    "five of the 34 target stars are fast rotators ( @xmath21 km s@xmath22 ) , while 22 stars have relatively low @xmath23 values ( @xmath24 km s@xmath22 ) .",
    "these results suggest that stars whose spectroscopic properties similar to the sun can have superflares , and this supports the hypothesis that the sun might cause a superflare . in the following",
    ", we conducted the detailed analyses for these 34 single stars ( ( * ? ? ? * notsu et al . 2015b ) ) .",
    "we here compare  @xmath0 \" with the brightness variation period ( @xmath17 ) , and consider whether the brightness variation of superflare stars is explained by the rotation . assuming that the brightness variations are caused by the rotation of the stars with starspots",
    ", we can estimate the rotational velocity ( @xmath25 ) from @xmath17 and @xmath26 ( stellar radius ) by using @xmath27    ) as a function of the stellar rotational velocity ( @xmath25 ) estimated from the period of the brightness variation and stellar radius .",
    "the typical error of @xmath25 is about @xmath2825%  of each value , considering errors of @xmath17 and @xmath26 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* notsu et al . 2015a ) ) .",
    "the solid line represents the case that our line of sight is vertical to the stellar rotation axis ( @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ) .",
    "we also plot three different lines , which correspond to smaller inclination angles ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "filled triangles represent superflare stars whose inclination angle is especially small ( @xmath34 ) , while filled circles represent the other stars ( @xmath35 ) . , scaledwidth=55.0% ]     +  in figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] , we plot @xmath23 as a function of the @xmath25 .",
    "some data points in figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] show differences between the values of @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath23 ) tends to be smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "such differences should be explained by the inclination effect , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* notsu et al . ( 2013a ) ) .",
    "on the basis of @xmath23 and @xmath25 , the stellar inclination angle ( @xmath36 ) can be estimated by using the following relation : @xmath37  in figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] , we also show four lines indicating @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "this figure shows two following important results .",
    "first , for almost all the stars ( 33 stars ) , the relation  @xmath40 \" is satisfied .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption that the brightness variation is caused by the rotation since the inclination effect mentioned above can cause the relation  @xmath40 \" if @xmath25 values really correspond to the rotational velocities ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is also supported by another fact that the distribution of the data points in figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] are not random .",
    "their distribution is expected to be much more random if the brightness variations have no relations with the stellar rotation .",
    "second , stars that are distributed in the lower right side of figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] are expected to have small inclination angles and to be nearly pole - on stars . in this figure",
    ", we distinguish such five stars with especially small inclination angle ( @xmath42 ) from the other stars , using filled triangle data points .",
    "= 3,000 g and 1,000 g .",
    "the thick and thin dashed lines correspond to the same relation in case of @xmath43 ( nearly pole - on ) for @xmath44=3,000 g and 1,000 g .",
    "open circle and triangle points on the filled squares represent the data points of the most energetic superflare event reported in @xcite of the 34 target superflare stars .",
    "open triangles represent superflare stars whose inclination angle is especially small ( @xmath34 ) , while open circles represent the others ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this classification is on the basis of figure [ fig : vlc - vsini].,scaledwidth=60.0% ]     +   we can confirm the above inclination effects from another point of view .",
    "figure [ fig : spotene ] is a scatter plot of the flare energy of superflares and solar flares as a function of the spot coverage .",
    "the spot coverage of superflare stars is calculated from the amplitude of stellar brightness variations .",
    "thick and thin solid lines correspond to the analytic relation between the spot coverage and the flare energy , which is obtained from equation ( 14 ) of @xcite in case of @xmath29 for @xmath44=3,000 g and 1,000 g .",
    "the thick and thin dashed lines correspond to the same relation in case of @xmath43 ( nearly pole - on ) for @xmath44=3,000 g and 1,000 g , assuming that the brightness variation becomes small as a result of the inclination effect .",
    "these lines are considered to give an upper limit of superflare energy for each inclination angle .",
    "considering these things , the superflare stars located in the upper left side of this figure are expected to have a low inclination angle .",
    "open triangles in figure [ fig : spotene ] correspond to superflare stars whose inclination angle is especially small ( @xmath34 ) on the basis of figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] , while open circles represent the other stars ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this classification is the same as that in figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] .",
    "all of the five triangle data points are located above the thick solid line ( @xmath29 and @xmath44=3000 g ) .",
    "this means that these stars are confirmed to have low inclination angle on the basis of both of the figures [ fig : vlc - vsini ] and [ fig : spotene ] . as a result",
    ", these two figures ( figures [ fig : vlc - vsini ] and [ fig : spotene ] ) are confirmed to be consistent . in other words ,",
    "the stellar projected rotational velocity spectroscopically measured is consistent with the rotational velocity estimated from the brightness variation .",
    "this fact supports that the brightness variation of superflare stars is caused by the rotation .      in order to investigate the chromospheric activity of the target stars",
    ", we measured @xmath45(8498 ) , @xmath45(8542 ) , @xmath45(8662 ) , and @xmath45(h@xmath14 ) index , which are the residual core flux normalized by the continuum level at the line cores of the ca ii irt and h@xmath14 , respectively .",

    "* takeda et al . 2010 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* notsu et al . 2013a ) ) .",
    "as the chromospheric activity is enhanced , the intensity of these indicators becomes large since a greater amount of emission from the chromosphere fills in the core of the lines .",
