    "i am grateful to the organizing committee for the opportunity to speak on searches for high - redshift quasars at this meeting .",
    "although i have not worked directly with hy , we have known each other for many years , and i have admired his research .",
    "i think three qualities stand out : 1 ) his determination and persistence at pushing telescopes and instruments to their limits , 2 ) his evident success at finding and studying successively more distant galaxies , and 3 ) his cheerfulness and optimism , which i think inspired his students and collaborators to be so successful over the many years of his career .",
    "i have also heard that hy never liked quasars very much , so i feel honored that the topic made it on the program .",
    "maybe the organizing committee decided it was safe to do so , now that galaxies have overtaken quasars as the objects of highest known redshift since 1997 , when they displaced quasars for the first time since 1965 .    turning to the subject of this paper ,",
    "the goals of surveys for high - redshift quasars include the observational determination of :    * the epoch of quasar formation * the role of dust obscuration * the relation of quasars to galaxy formation and evolution * the contribution of quasars to the ionization of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts    according to the picture that quasars are powered by the accretion of matter onto massive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies , the formation and evolution of black holes , quasars , and galaxies are closely related .",
    "the evolution of the space density of luminous quasars shows a strong peak at lookback times of 0.8 to 0.85 ( fig .",
    "the evolution of galaxies is very much under debate , as we are hearing at this meeting , but it appears to extend over a broader range of redshift .    among the questions we would like to address are : which formed first , galaxies ( or at least parts of galaxies ) , or quasars ?",
    "what roles do interactions and mergers play in the fueling of quasars ? and how do we account for the chemical abundances in high - redshift quasars , whose emission - line spectra look very similar to those at lower redshift ?",
    "we now have the observational capabilities to map the evolution of both quasars and galaxies to redshifts beyond 6 , when the universe was 5% or less of its present age .",
    "hubble space telescope and 8 - 10-m ground - based telescopes have already enabled us to discover more objects at @xmath2 than seemed possible just a few years ago .",
    "now the challenge is to carry out sufficiently large , systematic , and quantifiable surveys to answer the questions posed above .    in this paper",
    "i will discuss how to search for quasars at @xmath2 , concentrating on optical methods .",
    "next i will review the status of current surveys and then compare the spectra of the quasars and galaxies with @xmath3 that have been found to date .",
    "i will close by making some speculations based on the current results and considering what we may expect in the future .",
    "since the discovery of the first quasar with @xmath5 in 1987 ( warren et al .",
    "1987 ) , more than 150 such objects have been found ( g. djorgovski and r. mcmahon , private communications ) , and several search techniques are by now well developed .",
    "they include :    * multi - color imaging * slitless spectroscopy * deep radio surveys * deep x - ray surveys    the multicolor technique pioneered by warren et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and now applied to several surveys ( see , e.g. , warren et al . 1991 , irwin et al .",
    "1991 , kennefick et al .",
    "1995 , djorgovski 1999 ) has contributed the majority of the known @xmath5 quasars .",
    "it uses the large @xmath6 color of quasars as a discriminant ; the presence of ly@xmath7 emission in the @xmath8 filter band combined with the continuum depression caused by intervening ly@xmath7 absorption in the @xmath9 filter band makes quasars stand out from cool stars and yields an effective search criterion .",
    "the addition of @xmath10 band photometry , which is an indicator of the continuum level longward of ly@xmath7 , aids in distinguishing high - redshift quasars from late - type stars .",
    "the multicolor technique was first used with photographic plates and schmidt telescopes .",
    "the subsequent development of large format ccd cameras is now enabling wide - angle surveys to significantly fainter magnitudes , as discussed in more detail below .    at higher redshifts , e.g. @xmath2 ,",
    "the same principle applies , with ly@xmath7 shifting into the @xmath10 band .",
    "however , as we shall see below , it is critical to have observations in the @xmath11 band , which is in the continuum longward of ly@xmath7 , to separate quasars from late - type stars .",
    "the slitless spectroscopy technique is an effective way to discover high - redshift quasars through the direct detection of ly@xmath7 emission in low - resolution slitless spectra ( smith 1975 , osmer 1982 ) and has been used by schmidt , schneider , and gunn ( ssg , 1995 and references therein ) in their palomar grism surveys .",
    "the selection effects and survey efficiencies are more straightforward to model for slitless spectroscopy in many cases than they are for the multicolor technique .",
    "the ssg survey is one of the cornerstones of our knowledge of the evolution of optically selected quasars at @xmath12 .",
    "deep radio surveys offer a different way to discover high - redshift radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "a key property of radio - selected objects is that they are significantly less affected by surrounding or intervening dust that blocks optical radiation .",
    "although radio - loud quasars in general constitute about 10% of the total quasar population , the availability of deep radio surveys that cover a significant fraction of the sky offers the opportunity to find significant numbers of radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies at high redshift .",
    "current radio searches for high - redshift quasars make use of deep surveys for flat - spectrum sources ( e.g. hook and mcmahon 1998 ) while searches for high - redshift radio galaxies focus on steep - spectrum sources ( e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "1999 , also this volume ) . in both cases , subsequent selection concentrates on optically faint objects to help weed out objects of lower redshift .",
    "hook and mcmahon ( 1998 ) select objects that are red in @xmath6 to enhance the selection of high - redshift objects .",
    "van breugel et al . ( 1999 ) make use of the well - defined @xmath13 diagram for radio galaxies and concentrate on objects with faint @xmath14 magnitudes",
    ". the discoveries of the radio - selected quasar of highest known redshift , @xmath15 by hook and mcmahon ( 1998 ) and the radio galaxy of highest known redshift , @xmath16 by van breugel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrate the power of their approaches .",
    "it may be argued that x - ray emission is the key defining property of the global quasar / agn population and should be the primary search criterion for discovering them . however , until recently , x - ray observatories have not had sufficient sensitivity to reach the objects of highest redshift . the rosat deep survey ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) is an indicator of the advances we may expect from chandra ( e.g. , mathur , this volume ) and xmm as they come into operation ; it has yielded the x - ray selected quasar of highest known redshift , @xmath17 ( schneider et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the requirements are a limiting x - ray sensitivity of @xmath18 erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 ( 0.5  2kev ) and high accuracy , @xmath21 arcsec positions",
    "( to avoid confusion with foreground objects ) .",
    "then follow - up optical imaging and spectroscopy , presumably concentrating on faint , red objects , should be an effective way of isolating high - redshift objects .    to summarize , all approaches to find @xmath2 quasars need to cover a wide area on the sky to faint limiting sensitivities because the objects are so rare .",
    "optical surveys need to have wavelength coverage extending to 0.9@xmath22 ; indeed all approaches benefit from such coverage .",
    "searches at even higher redshifts will push the requirements into the infrared ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "i would like to give a status report on two multicolor surveys my collaborators and i are carrying out : the btc40 and the bfqs .",
    "i will also describe two other major optical surveys , cadis and sdss , and note the important contributions they are making to the search for quasars at @xmath2 .",
    "the btc40 is a large collaborative effort led by e. falco and is aimed at finding gravitational lenses and distant galaxy clusters as well as high - redshift quasars .",
    "it is an optical , multicolor survey that makes use of the btc camera and the ctio 4-m telescope .",
    "julia kennefick is leading the quasar survey team , whose other members include alberto conti , richard green , pat hall , eric monier , malcolm smith , and myself .",
    "btc40 has imaging data at high galactic latitude for 40 deg@xmath24 in the @xmath25 bands and reaches to @xmath26 25th magnitude at its deepest limit .",
    "all the imaging data are in hand and are being analyzed .",
    "the goal is to select @xmath2 quasar candidates to @xmath27 .",
    "the bfqs survey is being led by pat hall in collaboration with the other team members mentioned above .",
    "it also uses the btc camera and reaches to @xmath28 over 7 deg@xmath24 .",
    "it uses the @xmath29 bands and is aimed at quasars with @xmath30 down to l * luminosities .",
    "the bfqs imaging data are also in hand and are being analyzed .",
    "together , the btc40 and bfqs surveys extend the multicolor technique to fainter magnitudes and wider areas than have been covered before .    the cadis ( calar alto deep imaging survey , meisenheimer et al .",
    "1998 ) survey extends the multicolor concept to higher spectral resolution and broader wavelength coverage by using 13 medium - band filters over the 0.39 to 0.93@xmath22 range and 3 broad - band filters , including @xmath31 .",
    "the filters are designed to give both improved sensitivity to the quasars being sought and improved rejection of non - quasars , such as emission - line galaxies ( the veto filter concept ) .",
    "cadis plans to cover 9 fields , each @xmath32 in area . to date the cadis team ( wolf et al .",
    "1999 ) have shown the effectiveness of their approach by finding 6 quasars with @xmath33 to @xmath34 mag in one field , about 6 times the expected number .",
    "the cadis technique is more powerful than the original multicolor approaches because of its increased spectral resolution and greater number of filters . on the other hand ,",
    "it requires more observing time per unit area on the sky to reach a given limit in sensitivity .",
    "thus , it is a complementary and valuable addition to techniques for finding high - redshift quasars",
    ". it will be very important to see if the initial cadis results on the surface density apply to the additional fields in their survey .",
    "previous surveys have been subject to considerable field - to - field fluctuations , and it will be very interesting to see how the cadis results come out .",
    "our knowledge of the luminosity function of quasars to 22nd magnitude and fainter is still rudimentary .",
    "the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey , gunn & weinberg 1995 ) will be the definitive survey for high - redshift quasars ( and also for quasar clustering ) down to 20th magnitude because of its large area coverage , 10,000 deg@xmath24 .",
    "sdss is expected to yield 10@xmath35 quasars when completed .",
    "already the initial results are very exciting .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report the discovery of 15 quasars with @xmath36 in 140 deg@xmath24 , including quasars with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "they extend the high - redshift record for quasars for the first time since 1991 . ] .",
    "initial spectroscopic results from the btc40 survey confirm the importance of using the @xmath11 band for isolating @xmath2 quasar candidates .",
    "unlike the situation at @xmath39 , where quasars can be selected with reasonable efficiency solely on their large values of @xmath40 , the analogous approach using @xmath41 does not work for @xmath0 quasars .",
    "julia kennefick found that samples selected on the basis of large @xmath41 are overwhelmed by late - type stars .",
    "the @xmath11 band is necessary because it is a measure of the continuum level at wavelengths longward of the ly@xmath7 emission , and the behavior of late - type stars and @xmath0 quasars is significantly different in , for example , the @xmath42 two - color diagram , as kennefick s simulations show ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) .",
    "we are now in the process of selecting @xmath0 candidates for follow up with spectroscopic observations .",
    "the importance of the @xmath11 band is amply demonstrated in the sdss results ( fig .",
    "2 , right ) , where fan et al . ( 1999 ) illustrate the stellar locus in the @xmath43 plane and the location of their @xmath44 quasars , which are well separated from the stars .",
    "their results confirm that we now have well established techniques for finding the most distant quasars .",
    "it is of interest to note that the spectra of the @xmath1 quasars discovered to date ( fig .",
    "3 ) show the characteristically strong emission features of ly@xmath7 , c iv , nv and si iv + o iv ] seen in quasars at lower redshift and look remarkably similar to them .",
    "furthermore , the spectra provide information on the chemical abundances in the broad - line region that have important implications for the evolutionary history of the host galaxies of quasars ( see review by hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the spectra of the galaxies found so far at @xmath2 are very different from those of quasars ( figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "for example , the dey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) galaxy at @xmath45 has a very strong but narrow ly@xmath7 emission line on a weak continuum .",
    "the weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) galaxy at @xmath46 and the van breugel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) radio galaxy show ly@xmath7 emission that is considerably weaker , while the spinrad et al .",
    "( 1998 ) galaxy pair at @xmath45 has very weak , if any , emission and is distinguished primarily by a break in the continuum .",
    "let us consider for a moment the faintness of these galaxies and the large amount of spectroscopic observing time that has been dedicated by several groups of observers with the keck telescopes to searching for faint galaxies at high redshift .",
    "it is surely impressive that galaxies with @xmath0 are being found .",
    "the numerous discoveries exceed what i thought only a few years ago would occur .",
    "but the weakness of the spectral features of the galaxies shown in figs . 4 and 5 compared to the strength of quasar emission lines in fig .",
    "3 do make one wonder if quasars / agns with broad - line spectra are truly very scarce at @xmath0 .",
    "their spectra are much easier to identify than those of the galaxies seen to date .",
    "what is their absence telling us ?",
    "of course , it may just be too early to tell , and we must pursue the spectroscopic follow up of the @xmath47 surveys described above . in any case , the observational opportunities that we now have to study the universe at @xmath47 are very exciting , and we may expect continued important discoveries in the near future . let s meet again on the occasion of hy s 70th birthday to see what we have learned .",
    "between june , 1999 , when the meeting was held , and may , 2000 , more quasars with @xmath2 have been discovered , including ones at @xmath48 ( zheng et al .",
    "2000 ) , at @xmath49 ( stern et al .",
    "2000 ) and at @xmath50 ( fan et al .",
    "the @xmath51 object , which has @xmath52 , is the faintest known quasar at high redshift .",
    "the one at @xmath53 , with @xmath54 on the ab system , is very luminous .",
    "all have the strong emission lines characteristic of quasars at lower redshifts , and all have strong ly@xmath7 forest absorption at wavelengths shortward of their ly@xmath7 emission lines .",
    "however , the universe is still highly ionized at @xmath53 .",
    "fan et al . ( 2000b ) report that they have covered 600 deg@xmath24 so far in their work on the sloan digital sky survey and that the discovery of the @xmath50 quasar is consistent with the expectations of the schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) parameterization of the decline of the quasar luminosity function with increasing redshift .",
    "they also note that for @xmath55 it is difficult to distinguish quasars from very cool stars and brown dwarfs on the basis of the sdss filters alone .",
    "observations in the near infrared , where the cool objects have redder energy distributions than the quasars , aid in the selection of the quasars .",
    "i am grateful to the organizing committee for the invitation to speak and for their financial support .",
