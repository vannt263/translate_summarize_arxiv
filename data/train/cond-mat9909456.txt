    "there is a growing interest in literature@xcite on the physical manifestation of lvy diffusion .",
    "this interesting subject can be dealt with in two distinct ways .",
    "the first rests on the assumption that there exist in nature lvy fluctuations , namely stochastic processes of the lvy stable form@xcite .",
    "we refer to this approach as _",
    "stochastic_. there are many examples of this attitude , and we limit ourselves to quoting a sample of the early work based on this view @xcite . one of the most recent examples of this kind of approach is given by the work of ref.@xcite .",
    "the second way of dealing with lvy fluctuations is based on the assumption that these processes have a hamiltonian foundation .",
    "we refer to this kind of approach as _",
    "dynamic_. an outstanding champion of this view is zaslavsky and the interested reader is referred to his recent book@xcite for a transparent illustration of this perspective . according to zaslavsky s analysis , the hamiltonian dynamics yielding lvy diffusion is characterized by specific weak - chaos properties . for calculation purposes these properties can be mimicked by either maps @xcite of the same kind as those used to study intermittency @xcite or a suitable non - linear transformation of a random noise generator @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall refer ourselves to all these papers@xcite as examples of a dynamic approach to lvy diffusion not to speak of those papers explicitly using hamiltonian systems as diffusion generators@xcite .",
    "as far as the case of free diffusion is concerned , the dynamic and stochastic approach yield almost indistinguishable results .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to show that when the interesting case of a perturbation is considered , the dynamic approach and the stochastic approach can lead to totally different predictions .",
    "a reconciliation of the two approaches can only be obtained in the limiting case of external perturbations of extremely weak intensity .",
    "we consider a free motion of a point particle subject to a markovian stochastic noise @xmath0 .",
    "this means that for any infinitesimal time interval @xmath1 there is a momentum change per unit of mass given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the velocity of the particle . in the treatment of this letter",
    "the forcing term will be either a wiener or a lvy process .",
    "this means that the probability density for the fluctuation @xmath0 to make a jump by the intensity @xmath4 in the time interval @xmath5 , @xmath6 , defined through the inverse fourier transform of its characteristic function , reads : @xmath7 in the case of a wiener process , and : @xmath8 in the case of a symmetric lvy process .",
    "the lvy process is characterized by a positive parameter @xmath9 , determining the width of the distribution and by the coefficient @xmath10 determining the specific lvy statistics of the system .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamic approach to lvy processes has to be restricted to the range : @xmath11 , while , as well known @xcite , the full range of lvy processes is : @xmath12 .",
    "thus , to make a comparison between the stochastic and the dynamic approach we are forced to restrain our analysis to the restricted interval of @xmath10 values : @xmath13 . in this interval",
    "we do not have available any known analytical expression for the density distribution @xmath14 .",
    "however , we know @xcite that the distribution is bell - shaped and that in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath4 is characterized by inverse power law tails , proportional to @xmath15 . as far as the width of the distribution is concerned , it can not be defined by the variance , which is infinite . in a loose sense",
    "the width of the distribution is determined by the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "it is evident that eq.([free ] ) makes the distribution @xmath16 identical to @xmath14    let us consider the perturbation of the free diffusion generated by eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) by means of : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a generic perturbation .",
    "for simplicity we restrict our analysis to the case of linear damping , thereby replacing @xmath18 in eq.([mainequation ] ) with @xmath19 : @xmath20 when the fluctuation @xmath21 is the wiener process of eq .",
    "( [ wienerproc ] ) , eq.([damped ] ) becomes the ordinary ornstein - uhlenbeck process , which yields the fokker - planck equation and with it the equilibrium gaussian density , whose fourier transform is @xmath22 , with variance : @xmath23 if @xmath0 is the lvy process of eq.([levyproc ] ) , the fourier transform of the equilibrium distribution is @xmath24 , with the same exponent @xmath10 as that of free diffusion .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) is defined by : @xmath26 we note that @xmath27 and @xmath28 share the same structure . in both cases the effect of the friction term is that of quenching the free diffusion so as to generate a time independent , or equilibrium , distribution .",
    "this means that @xmath29 .",
    "both the wiener and lvy noise illustrated in section ii are mathematical abstractions with a limit of validity .",
    "the discrepancy between this mathematical abstraction and physical reality can become significant as a result of an external perturbation forcing the dynamics of the system to produce physical effects stemming from the time scale where the mathematical idealization departs from physical reality . here",
    "we focus our attention on the case where the physical reality is assumed to be properly described by the dichotomous fluctuation @xmath30 used in earlier work for a dynamic derivation of lvy processes@xcite .",
    "we assign to this dichotomous variable the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 . according to ref . @xcite the statistics of the diffusion process generated by this variable are determined by both its dichotomous nature and its correlation function @xmath33 .",
    "we assign to this correlation function the form : @xmath34 according to the theoretical analysis of ref.@xcite , the dichotomous nature of this fluctuation makes especially relevant the physical meaning of the function @xmath35 defined by : @xmath36 this function is the distribution of sojourn times in one of the two equiprobable states of the dichotomous variable @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 denotes the mean waiting sojourn time .",
    "it is convenient to illustrate some aspects of the free diffusion process generated by this fluctuation , namely , the case described by :    @xmath38    a realization of this process of free diffusion is : @xmath39 @xmath40 here the @xmath41 denote the time durations of the sojourns in the accelerating states occurring prior to time @xmath5 , and the @xmath42 denote either the value @xmath31 or the value @xmath32 of the dichotomous fluctuation .",
    "the distribution of the sojourn times is given by eq .",
    "( [ t_sogg ] ) .",
    "thus we easily derive the distribution of the velocity jumps @xmath43 , which turns out to be : @xmath44    this distribution is of central importance to predict the statistics of the resulting diffusion process .",
    "if @xmath45 the second moment of this distribution is finite . thus we are allowed to apply the conventional central limit theorem , thereby recovering a diffusion process , indistinguishable in the long - time limit from those triggered by the wiener fluctuations , with variance per unit of time given by : @xmath46 we say @xcite that the diffusion process is attracted by the basin of gauss statistics .",
    "if @xmath47 the second moment of the distribution of eq.([dist_dicot ] ) is not finite , and we are therefore forced to use the lvy - khintchine - gnedenko theorem @xcite ( that is , the extension of the central limit theorem for random variables with no finite variance ) . according to ref . [",
    "17 ] and to the result of the appendix , this condition yields a lvy process with parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 given by : @xmath48 and @xmath49 in this case we say that the diffusion process is attracted by the basin of lvy statistics .",
    "we see that in the long - time limit the diffusion generated by @xmath30 is essentially indistinguishable from that generated by the lvy fluctuation @xmath4 . what about the influence of an external perturbation on these two distinct fluctuations ?",
    "one might be tempted to make the conjecture that both processes result in the same equilibrium distribution . however , for this conjecture to be correct it would be necessary to apply first the generalized central limit theorem and , afterwards , the external perturbation . in general , the result is different from what one would obtain reversing this order , namely , applying the perturbation first , and the time asymptotic analysis next .",
    "thus the naive prediction that both fluctuations produce the same equilibrium distribution , in general is wrong .    to substantiate our view ,",
    "let us consider the _ dynamic counterpart _ of eq.([damped ] ) : @xmath50 it is easy to solve eq.([damped&dyn ] ) . in a single motion event",
    "we have : @xmath51 @xmath52 here @xmath3 is forced to remain in the interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the computer simulation of this letter is based , as done in ref.@xcite , on generating , by means of a suitable non - linear deformation of the random numbers with a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath54 $ ] , a sequence of sojourn times @xmath55 with the density of eq.([t_sogg ] ) , and with another random number generator , equivalent to tossing a coin , a random sequence of velocity signs . for each trajectory realization",
    "we set the initial condition @xmath56 and the trajectory is observed till to a fixed stop time , and subsequently recorded in a bin .",
    "each trial was repeated @xmath57 times . in all the numerical calculations behind the results illustrated in the enclosed figures , we assume that equilibrium is reached after a time @xmath58 . the following subsections are devoted to illustrating the results obtained in three distinct physical conditions .",
    "note that to illustrate the equilibrium distribution shape corresponding to different values of @xmath59 we use a variable @xmath60 , which is the rescaled velocity obtained by multiplying the original velocity @xmath61 by the factor @xmath62 .",
    "thus the rescaled velocity ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .      in the strong damping case , say when @xmath65 , for any of the two accelerating states equilibrium is reached before the state comes to its end .",
    "this means that the preferred velocity values will be either @xmath62 or @xmath66 .",
    "this also means that the equilibrium distribution is expected to be @xmath67-shaped , as confirmed by the curve of fig .",
    "[ formazionelevy ] corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "this damping - induced @xmath67-shaped distribution is generated by system s dynamics regardless of whether the corresponding free diffusion is located in the lvy or the gauss basin of attraction .",
    "we have seen that in the case of very large friction the distribution has a distinct @xmath67-shaped form : this means two peaks enclosing an almost empty central region . from fig .",
    "[ formazionelevy ] we see also that weakening the perturbation intensity has first the effect of populating this empty central region with a uniform distribution ( see the curve corresponding to @xmath69 )",
    ". a further decrease of the perturbation intensity ( @xmath70 ) makes a bell - shaped lvy distribution of decreasing width and increasing amplitude appear in this central part of the equilibrium distribution .",
    "[ lambdacost4 ] is devoted to illustrating the effect that changing @xmath71 has on the distribution shape , in a case of weak friction , namely , with @xmath72 .",
    "note that in the gauss basin of attraction , with @xmath73 , the distributions are gaussian functions with no algebraic tails , whereas in the lvy basin of attraction , with @xmath74 , the equilibrium distribution is markedly characterized by the emergence of slow tails .",
    "the transition from the one to the other condition takes place at @xmath75 .",
    "as pointed out in subsection 3 b , in the weak - friction regime , the statistics of the equilibrium distribution are determined by the values of the parameter @xmath71 . according to whether system s dynamics belongs to the gauss or the the lvy basin of attraction , we are led to adopt different criteria to determine the distribution width using the stochastic analysis , i.e. the variance @xmath28 or the parameter @xmath27 . in the former case , @xmath45 , the variance @xmath28 is obtained using eq.([sig_ou ] ) and eq.([varfree ] ) .",
    "this yields :    ( 400,270)(0,0 ) = 6truecm = 14truecm ( 0,35 )    ( 400,270)(0,0 ) = 10truecm = 17truecm ( -10,20 )    ( 400,270)(0,0 ) = 10truecm = 16truecm ( -10,10 )    ( 400,270)(10,0 ) = 10truecm = 17truecm ( -20,0 )    @xmath76 thereby resulting in a divergence for @xmath77 . on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ misure_b_beta ] we establish a comparison between this theoretical prediction and the corresponding numerical result . for @xmath78",
    "we find an excellent agreement between theory and numerical simulation .",
    "we note however that the numerical calculations do not produce any divergence at the transition from the gauss to the lvy basin of attraction . in the latter case , when @xmath79 , the expected lvy equilibrium distribution ( see @xcite ) should be characterized by the value of the parameter @xmath27 obtained using eqs.([b_sw ] ) , ( [ b_free ] ) , ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "this value is : @xmath80 which results again in a divergence at the transition from the lvy to the gauss basin of attraction . in the left side of fig.[misure_b_beta ]",
    "the comparison between theoretical prediction and numerical calculation shows a good agreement around @xmath81 .",
    "although the numerical calculation does not result in any divergence , we see that decreasing the friction intensity has the effect of improving the agreement between theoretical prediction and numerical finding .",
    "the measured values of the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 becomes increasingly larger at the transition from one basin of attraction to the other , and the overall behavior becomes increasingly similar to that of a phase transition .",
    "[ misure_coda ] is devoted to illustrating the peak contributions to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "we have evaluated numerically the amount of population for @xmath82 .",
    "we see that decreasing @xmath59 has the effect depleting this region if @xmath83 , while a significant amount of population is left in this region if @xmath79 .",
    "this numerical result shows that at extremely small friction values , moving from @xmath79 to @xmath45 has the significant effect of making the peak intensity drop to zero , even if the phase - transition character of the passage from @xmath79 to @xmath45 is characterized by rare intense fluctuations and , consequently , by a large numerical error .",
    "as its main contribution , this paper sheds light into the difference between the conventional stochastic approach and the dynamic approach . of some relevance",
    "is the numerical method adopted . rather than using as stochastic generators intermittent maps",
    "we have founded our numerical treatment on the random generation of the waiting time distribution , a fact that allowed us to settle numerically problems that would have implied otherwise hard numerical difficulties .",
    "setting apart the case of strong friction where the stochastic and the dynamic method yield strikingly different results , the numerical method used made it possible to settle two much more delicate problems :        it has to be pointed out that this transition region is not yet well understood @xcite and further research work along the lines of this letter might serve the interesting purpose of establishing whether in the limiting case of very small friction the equilibrium distribution yields the divergencies predicted by eq .",
    "( [ sig_sto ] ) and eq.([b_sto ] ) or a finite values , as suggested by the recent theoretical analysis of ref .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ misure_b_beta ] that the numerical analysis yields finite rather than divergent widths at @xmath75 , but at the moment it is not yet clear if this is due to @xmath84 , as argued in ref . [",
    "20 ] , or to the adoption of not yet sufficiently small values of @xmath59 .      in this appendix",
    "we show how to determine the parameter @xmath9 defining the width of the diffusion process ( [ levyproc ] ) generated , in the long - time limit , by the dichotomous variable of eq.([dicotfree ] ) .",
    "to realize this goal we use some fundamental theorems established by lvy , kintchine and gnedenko , whose detailed demonstration can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the central issue is the assessment of the limit distribution of the normalized sum of the independent and identically distributed random variables @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are suitable normalization constants . to establish this limit condition we rest on the following three properties .",
    "first , we define what a stable distribution is all about .",
    "a distribution @xmath89 is _ stable _ if given the arbitrary real numbers @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 there exist the numbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 such that the equality @xmath96 holds . here",
    "@xmath97 denotes the convolution product .",
    "second , we use a theorem by kintchine and lvy @xcite which establishes that the stable distributions are those , and only those , corresponding to the sum of eq.([normsumcano ] ) converging to a finite limit as @xmath98 .",
    "third , using another theorem kintchine and lvy @xcite , we express the stable distribution by means of characteristic functions with the form @xmath99 .",
    "the range of @xmath10 is : @xmath100 , namely wider than that compatible with the dynamic treatment of this letter that only focuses on the interval : @xmath101 .",
    "our treatment is restricted to the case of symmetric distribution , thereby setting @xmath102 .",
    "the same theorem by kintchine and lvy establishes that : of eq .",
    "( [ b_levkin ] ) is missing . ]",
    "@xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are two constants establishing the distribution asymptotic properties .",
    "let us consider the distribution function @xmath107 of the random variable @xmath108 . according to a theorem established by gnedenko @xcite",
    ", the distribution @xmath107 converges to a stable function @xmath89 in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ stability ] ) if , and only if , the following relations @xmath109 and @xmath110 hold .",
    "note that the function @xmath111 and @xmath112 vanish for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath115 depends on the choice of @xmath88 appearing in eq.([normsumcano ] ) .",
    "we make the choice @xmath116 yielding @xmath117 .",
    "thus in the the asymptotic limit @xmath118 the distribution @xmath107 only depends on @xmath105 and @xmath106 . furthermore , the earlier choice of a symmetric distribution yields @xmath119 .",
    "note that to realize our purposes we have to adopt the non - normalized form : @xmath120 it is evident that this non - normalized form can be related to the normalized form of eq .",
    "( [ normsumcano ] ) by setting @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing the parameter @xmath105 , responsible , as earlier shown , for the asymptotic distribution properties , with @xmath123 . claiming no rigour , we set @xmath124 , where @xmath37 is the mean value of the interval between two realizations of @xmath125 , so @xmath126 is the mean number of realizations of the random variable @xmath127 .",
    "thus we obtain for the stochastic lvy process",
