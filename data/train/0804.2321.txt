    "acoustic emission ( ae ) in fracture is an example of a broader phenomenon known as ` crackling noise '  @xcite .",
    "a system crackles in response to an external stimulus leading to energy dissipation in the form of avalanches of events with no characteristic size .",
    "examples can be found in volcanic rocks  @xcite , crumpling paper  @xcite , superconductors  @xcite , disordered magnets  @xcite , or plastic deformation of materials  @xcite .",
    "the release of acoustic energy in fracture experiments is related to irreversible processes , like creation of microcracks and deformation .",
    "ae experiments in stressed materials typically give a power - law distribution of the dissipated energy , @xmath4 , as the system is slowly driven towards catastrophic failure .",
    "this can be seen as a small - scale analog of the gutenberg - richter law for earthquakes .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 is found to depend on the material and in the literature one can find @xmath6 in synthetic plaster  @xcite , @xmath7 in paper  @xcite , @xmath8 in fiberglass and @xmath9 in wood  @xcite , @xmath10 in cellular glass  @xcite , and @xmath11 in paper peeling experiments  @xcite .",
    "this spread of values indicates that the exponent is not universal and it may depend on the material characteristics as well as on the loading conditions .    in simple discrete models the scale - free response",
    "is associated with a cascade of local failures . as the external load is slowly increased",
    "weak elements fail to hold the imposed local stress and break . some internal load redistribution mechanism , whose details depend on the particular model , increases the local stress on the remaining elements and may cause further simultaneous local failures . as a result",
    ", the material may respond in avalanches of failure events whose size distribution is often very broad .    for obvious reasons",
    "ae is a very useful non - destructive tool that , if properly understood , may give crucial information about the damage accumulated in loaded materials . indeed ,",
    "mean - field calculations and simulations in some simplified models indicate that the energy statistics follows a power law with an exponent that changes as the catastrophic failure point is reached  @xcite .",
    "events recorded near global failure show a power law decay with an exponent distinctively smaller than those events recorded far away from the breakdown point .",
    "interestingly , recent experiments on granite under different loading conditions have shown a qualitative agreement with this theoretical observation  @xcite .",
    "should this be a robust and universal property it could be potentially used as a tool to easily diagnose the damage in loaded materials .    scaling in fracture",
    "is apparently very generic and can also be observed in other quantities ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the distribution of quiet times between ae events also obeys a power law analog of the omori law for earthquakes occurrence  @xcite .",
    "scale - invariant behavior is also observed in the height - height correlations of fracture surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the existence of scaling laws in experiments suggests an interpretation in terms of critical behavior as the global failure point is approached .",
    "however , results are not conclusive and a straightforward link between experiments and models is still lacking .    from a theoretical point of view fracture physics is a challenging open problem .",
    "materials are heterogeneous and disorder details may play a crucial role . however , the existence of power law behavior makes it appealing to try to describe fracture with very simplified models that include the most relevant symmetries , dimensionality , disorder features , and loading conditions .    there has been a great effort devoted to describe fracture crack surfaces in a simple way by means of stochastic field equations for the dynamics of an advancing front , where the crack is modeled as an elastic string driven through a disordered medium in the presence of non - local interactions  @xcite . however , continuous crack line models have failed to fully agree with experiments , seemingly because certain important aspects of fracture , like nucleation of voids in the advancing front , are not addressed in these continuum approaches . in this respect ,",
    "lattice models are expected to be more appropriate .",
    "lattice models describe the elastic solid as a network of springs with random failure thresholds where the displacement field can be either scalar or vector .",
    "in particular , the random fuse model ( rfm )  @xcite has attracted a lot of attention as a minimal model for fracture since it is capable of reproducing some essential features of the fracture phenomenon in a very simple setting .",
    "the rfm represents a scalar electrical analog of the elasticity problem .",
    "this correspondence is based on the formal equivalence between the mathematical form of the generalized hooke s law for the scalar elastic problem , @xmath12 , and the equations for the electrical problem , @xmath13 , where the stress ( @xmath14 ) , local elastic modulus ( @xmath15 ) and strain ( @xmath16 ) can be mapped to the current density ( @xmath17 ) , local conductance ( @xmath18 ) , and local potential drop ( @xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "this model goes one step further than mean - field models , like the fiber bundle model , by including local distribution of stress between the nodes , while preserving the simplicity in the introduction of disorder as a distribution of thresholds in the system .",
    "much attention has been devoted to the rfm in the last two decades , including studies concerning the influence of disorder  @xcite , presence of multiscaling behavior in voltage and current  @xcite , roughness exponents  @xcite , damage localization  @xcite , and failure avalanche distributions  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an experimental realization of the rfm has recently been studied  @xcite to investigate the influence of disorder on the _ i - v _ characteristic and crack length .",
    "the dynamics of the rfm takes place in the form of avalanches of failure events .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to link avalanche activity to the ae observed in experiments .",
    "several studies have focused on the statistics of avalanches of failure events in the fuse model  @xcite and improved simulation algorithms have recently allowed to study larger systems with much better statistics  @xcite .",
    "however , numerical determinations of the energy exponent @xmath5 under different loading rates or on different lattices are scarce .",
    "lattice models typically predict larger energy exponents @xmath5 than those obtained in experiments .",
    "a number of reasons might be responsible for this discrepancy including the brittle nature of the models , the existence of dispersion of acoustic waves in experiments , or the lack of an effective time scale separation between stress relaxation and loading in real systems , which is assumed in quasi - static models .",
    "here we study the statistics of the dissipated energy in the rfm under different imposed strain conditions .",
    "we compare seemingly equivalent definitions of the dissipated energy . for a infinitely slow driving rate ( quasi - static model )",
    "we find that the pdf of the released energy shows two different scaling regions . for low energies ,",
    "the dissipated energy distribution is robust and independent of the lattice geometry .",
    "we find @xmath20 and a simple scaling argument is given to explain this behavior .",
    "however , at high energies the distribution exhibits a crossover to a regime where @xmath21 , whenever the energy losses are evaluated over the whole volume of the system .",
    "we also study a different estimator of the dissipated energy that takes into account the energy losses occurring only at microfractures .",
    "this microscopic estimator exhibits strong finite - size effects and fails to show critical behavior . in a different",
    "setting , when the system is driven at finite strain load rates , we find that the energy distribution decays as @xmath3 for all the energy range .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : disc ]",
    "we study a two - dimensional lattice of fuses with unit conductivity @xmath22 and a disordered threshold current @xmath23 that is a quenched random variable from a uniform probability distribution in the interval @xmath24 .",
    "an external voltage is imposed between two bus bars placed at the top and the bottom of the system and periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal direction .",
    "the system can be driven by a slowly increasing voltage or current , mimicking the experimental situation where either strain or stress load can be imposed , respectively . at each update ,",
    "the kirchhoff voltage equations are solved to determine the currents flowing in the lattice .",
    "all fuses with current exceeding the corresponding local threshold are blown and , once the entire system is below threshold , the voltage ( current ) is again increased .",
    "an avalanche of failure consists of all the fuses blown between two external voltage ( current ) increments .",
    "each fuse behaves linearly until the local current @xmath25 reaches the threshold .",
    "then , the fuse burns and irreversibly becomes insulator @xmath26 , so that burnt fuses are no longer able to carry any current .",
    "the current is redistributed instantaneously after a fuse is burnt so that current relaxation occurs in time scale that is much faster than the driving time scale . in our simulations",
    ", voltage driving is imposed .",
    "the described configuration should be compared with experimental setups in mode - i fracture where the strain is slowly increased .",
    "an experimental comparison of the ae and critical behavior of fracture precursors for different load features ( strain vs. stress loading ) and geometries has been reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although imposed strain experiments indicate an induced plastic deformation in the final stages , no differences were encountered in ae distribution between the two different loading conditions .",
    "the need to solve a large system of linear equations for each update implies a high computational cost and limited the reachable system size and the statistical sampling in this model in the past , when the best performance was achieved by conjugate gradient methods  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new algorithm based on rank - one downdate of sparse cholesky factorizations has been introduced  @xcite , which can largely reduce the computational cost of the simulations . here",
    "we make use of this algorithm to study two - dimensional networks of fuses in triangular and diamond lattices .",
    "we studied systems of linear size ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and @xmath29 realizations of the disorder .",
    "in stressed materials elastic energy is stored due to redistribution of the external load all across the lattice .",
    "energy dissipation in the rfm occurs in bursts of breaking events which can be be compared with the ae observed in experiments . in doing so , one is assuming that the main contribution to ae is given by the dissipated elastic energy , while dislocations and friction are , in a slowly driven experiment , secondary contributions to ae . also , it is worth to keep in mind that in real systems one expects that only a fraction of this dissipated energy leads to the ae observed , while the remaining losses are due to other dissipative mechanisms like dispersion or damping of acoustic waves , which are not described by purely elastic models like the rfm .",
    "several ways to define the dissipated energy can be envisaged as we discuss below .",
    "pradhan _ et .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath30 for the rfm on diamond lattices under stress loading conditions .",
    "they calculated the electric power dissipation in the fuse model as the product of the voltage drop across the network and the total current that flows through it .",
    "the power dissipation in the electrical model is equivalent to the stored elastic energy in a mechanical system .",
    "this is a global definition that assumes that the whole volume of the system contributes to the dissipated energy .",
    "alternatively , following salminen _ et .",
    "@xcite , we can define the energy lost during a given avalanche event @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the change in the elastic modulus due to the failure avalanche , @xmath34 is the number of broken bonds ( avalanche size ) of the @xmath31th event , and @xmath35 is the corresponding potential drop between the bus bars ( strain imposed in the sample).this definition makes use of the global strain imposed on the system and can be seen as a coarse - grained or _ macroscopic _ measure of the dissipated energy .",
    "note that both , pradhan _ et .",
    "@xcite and salminen _ et .",
    "@xcite , definitions of the dissipated energy take into account the whole volume of the system",
    ". however , there is strong experimental evidence indicating that ae is actually a localized phenomenon in space and time so that energy release actually occurs at microfractures  @xcite , and it is not therefore spread across the system .",
    "this suggests one should consider other ways to define the dissipated energy in the model , in particular , it may be interesting to study measures of released energy that are directly linked to the bonds involved in avalanches of local breaking events .",
    "( top curve ) to @xmath36 ( bottom curve ) . a first region with slope @xmath37",
    "is followed by a second region dominated by fluctuations.,width=283 ]    in this spirit , we introduce here what we call _ microscopic _ dissipated energy , which is defined as the sum of the energy losses at every element of the system involved in the @xmath31th failure avalanche .",
    "this can be calculated by adding up the energy dissipated by each individual broken bond , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the local potential drop at bond @xmath40 .",
    "since fuses break right at the threshold we can define the _ microscopic _ dissipated energy due to the @xmath31th failure avalanche as @xmath41 where the sum runs over each broken bond within the @xmath31th avalanche .",
    "we devote the rest of the paper to analyze the dissipated energy statistics in the fuse model for the case of infinitesimal strain ( quasi - static model ) and also under different finite strain rates ( non quasi - static model ) .",
    "we shall be comparing the numerical results for the different measures of the dissipated energy discussed above for triangular and diamond lattices .",
    "one would expect that the three definitions give similar temporal behavior for the dissipated energy statistics , apart from constant factors .",
    "although this is actually the case in the low energy range , dissipation statistics differs at high energies for different estimators .",
    "let us first focus on infinitesimal driving .",
    "for the sake of computational convenience , a voltage @xmath42 is fixed between the two bus bars . the next fuse to burn is determined by @xmath43 so the external voltage is increased until this fuse exactly reaches its threshold .",
    "the new current configuration is calculated according to kirchhoff equations .",
    "this rearrangement can cause other fuses to overpass their thresholds without further voltage increase .",
    "all the fuses burnt at the same external voltage constitute an avalanche .",
    "this process is repeated until the network becomes disconnected .",
    "realizations in a @xmath44 diamond lattice .",
    "all the three energies , global , macroscopic and microscopic , exhibit the same @xmath45 trend .",
    "the three curves have been rescaled by its maximum for clarity.,width=283 ]    quasi - static dynamics results in two very well separated time scales , i.e. a fast relaxation process and a slow external driving .",
    "as occurs in other systems exhibiting a well defined time scale separation ( as for instance in self - organized criticality ) , the natural time scale is given by the slow time scale .",
    "therefore , in the following , time refers to the number of avalanches occurred . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a typical realization of the temporal evolution for the dissipated energy according to eq .",

    "the origin of the robust @xmath47 growth law is perhaps more transparent in eq .",

    "the conclusion is that the lack of time scale separation leads to a significative change in the distribution of the dissipated energy in the fuse model , as it should be expected . from a physical point of view",
    "there are strong differences in the system dynamics in the case of infinitesimal driving as compared with finite driving .",
    "if the system is driven at finite rates , relaxation to one of the infinitely many metastable configurations is not reached before a new perturbation acts on the system .",
    "this gives rise to a highly nonlinear superposition of cascades of released energy instead of individual well - defined avalanche events .",
    "a finite driving rate generically leads to a growth of the dissipated energy at a much faster rate than the usual quasi - static dynamics , possibly exponential for any finite driving rate in large enough systems . in turn",
    ", this fast growth takes the crossover energy @xmath56 to exponentially large values .",
    "the result is that the range of energies in which the pdf of the dissipated energy is described by eq .",

    "we have studied the rfm for fracture under strain loading conditions .",
    "we have focused on the dissipated energy in order to test the validity of the model to account for the ae statistics observed in real experiments in loaded materials .",
    "different ways to define the released energy have been discussed , including a microscopic quantity that takes into account just the energy losses at each broken bond during an avalanche .",
    "our results indicate that , for quasi - static dynamics , the dissipated energy statistics exhibits two very different regions depending on the energy scale one is looking at .",
    "these two scaling regions are separated by a typical energy @xmath120 and obey finite - size critical behavior .",
    "the low - energy region , for @xmath63 , is well described by a power - law decay @xmath121 , which is robust and independent of lattice geometry .",
    "we gave a simple scaling argument showing that this robustness is linked to the generic @xmath47 growth law of the dissipated energy ; a feature shared by all the energy estimators we studied on any system size and lattice type and that it is directly linked to the quasi - static nature of the model .",
    "the statistics above the typical energy @xmath122 crosses over to @xmath123 and ranges several decades in energy .",
    "apart from scaling factors , the three energy definitions used here were expected to show similar statistics . however , while the behavior of macroscopic and global energies can be captured by the same scaling exponents and the high - energy region exponent is well defined , this is not the case for the microscopic energy that , although it obeys the same scaling form , shows no system size dependence and a different ( size - dependent ) exponent for the high energy region is obtained . regarding the microscopic energy we introduced here",
    "one must admit that scaling in the high - energy region is not satisfying in general terms .",
    "not only the numerical value of the exponent depends on the lattice size and fails to exhibit finite - size scaling , but also the scaling region covers a very narrow energy range .",
    "this should be particularly relevant when comparing with real fracture experiments that have shown that dissipated energy participating in ae is not released all across the sample , but , quite the opposite , localized at microfractures  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also studied the fuse model at finite driving rates .",
    "it is an often expressed belief that relaxing the quasi - static condition might lead to @xmath5 exponents that compare better with experiments .",
    "we showed that under finite driving the cut - off energy diverges exponentially , so that the scaling @xmath3 dominates all the energy range at any given time for large enough driving rates ( possibly for any finite driving rate in large enough systems ) .",
    "the conclusion is that relaxing the quasi - static condition can not give account of experiments , where @xmath5 typically ranges between @xmath124 ",
    "@xmath125 depending on the material .",
    "the evidence we have up to now about the rfm indicates that it might well be the case that other essential aspects to quantitatively account for ae energy exponents in real materials , like plasticity , dislocations , friction , damping of acoustic waves , etc .",
