    "the idea of string theoretic description of gauge theories is an old one @xcite @xcite .",
    "despite of the years passed on this idea , it is still activating different research works in theoretical physics @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . on the other hand , in the last years our understanding about string theory",
    "is changed dramatically ; a stream which is usually called the `` second string revolution '' @xcite .",
    "the aim of this stream is formulating of a unified string theory as a fundamental theory of the known interactions .",
    "one of the most applicable tools in the above program are d@xmath1-branes @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that d@xmath1-branes are perturbative representation of nonperturbative ( strongly coupled ) string theories .",
    "it has been known for a long time that hadron - hadron scattering processes have two different behaviours depending on the amount of momentum transfer @xcite . at large momentum transfer interactions",
    "appear as interactions between the hadron constituents , partons or quarks , and some qualitative similarities to electron - hadron scattering emerge . at high energies and small momentum transfers regge trajectories",
    "are exchanged .",
    "regge trajectories provide a motivation for the first stringy picture of strong interaction . however , the good fitting between the regge trajectories and the mass of strong bound - states is yet unexplained @xcite .",
    "deducing the apparently different observations above discussed from a unified picture is the challenge of theoretical physics and it is tempting to search for the application of the recent string theoretic progresses in this area . in this way one may find d@xmath1-branes",
    "good tools whose dynamics may be taken as a proper effective theory for the bound - states of quarks and qcd - strings ( qcd electric fluxes ) . to use the string theory tools for qcd - strings one should replace the string theory parameters with those of qcd in a proper way .",
    "the case here is in the reverse direction of going from early days of string theory , as the theory of strong interaction , to string theory , as the theory of gravity .    to push the above idea , in two works @xcite , taking the dynamics of d0-branes as a toy model ,",
    "the potential and the scattering amplitude of two d0-branes were calculated .",
    "it is found that the potential between static d0-branes is a linear potential @xcite .",
    "also the potential between two fast decaying d0-branes , which in the extreme limit see each other instantaneously , is calculated and the general results are found in agreement with phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude of two d0-branes was calculated in @xcite based on the results of @xcite , it is shown that the cross section shows the regge pole - expansion .",
    "regge behaviour has been used some years ago to fit the hadron - hadron total cross section data successfully @xcite ( see also @xcite for some more recent application of this behaviour ) .",
    "based on the results of @xcite@xcite and some further discussions , we argue that different aspects of light - front formulation of qcd may be recovered by the matrix quantum mechanics of d0-branes . in this paper",
    "we consider the matrix quantum mechanics resulting from dimensional reduction of @xmath2 dimensional pure @xmath3 ym theory to @xmath4 dimension .",
    "a detailed procedure of constructing this matrix mechanics is presented in @xcite .",
    "in analogy with string theory ( @xmath5 or 25 ) , we call _ d0-branes _ the free - particles sector of the moduli space .",
    "we hope that these kinds of studies shed light on possible new relation between d - brane dynamics and gauge theories .",
    "also we adjust our discussions to be in a reasonable contact with the known phenomenological aspects , though the exact match with experiments should not be expected at this level .",
    "in sec.2 we review the distinguished role of light - front coordinates for explaining the scaling behaviour of hadrons structure functions ; the same behaviour which is taken as the consequence of point - like substructure in hadrons . in sec.3 a short review of matrix quantum mechanics of d0-branes",
    "is presented . in sec.4",
    "the calculation of the inter d0-branes potential will be presented .",
    "the discussion on the `` whiteness '' of d0-branes bound - states is given in sec.5 .",
    "in sec.6 we deal with the problem of scattering .",
    "sec.7 is devoted to discussions .",
    "three issues are discussed in sec.7 : 1 ) large-@xmath0 limit , 2 ) quarks , gauge theory and gravity solutions relation and 3 ) non - commutativity . the discussion on the non - commutativity is on a possible justification for appearance `` non - commutative '' coordinates in the study of `` non - abelian '' bound - states , such as bound - states of quarks and gluons .",
    "before gauge theoretic description of strong interaction , qcd , there was constituent quark model ( cqm ) for hadrons .",
    "according to cqm a meson is just a quark - antiquark bound - state and a baryon is a three - quark one .",
    "the bound - state problem has been extensively studied for years by phenomenological inter - quark potentials to calculate various low - energy quantities .",
    "the agreement between calculated and observed quantities has been always too well to justify pursuing this approach to study hadron properties @xcite .",
    "presently qcd is established to be the underlying theory for strong bound - states and also it has been understood that qcd - vacuum is a very complicated medium . in low energy",
    "the coupling constant is large and so quantum fluctuations are highly excited .",
    "it means that basically `` sea '' of quarks and gluons have considerable contribution to the properties of hadrons .",
    "moreover , the phenomena like confinement is believed to be direct consequences of the complex nature of the qcd - vacuum .",
    "so it seems that hadron picture of qcd is not reconcilable with any few - body picture of hadrons , like cqm ( see @xcite for a good discussion on this point ) .",
    "experimentally , substructure of hadrons is probed in sufficiently large momentum transfer scatterings of a fundamental particle , e.g. an electron , in the so - called deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments .",
    "the existence of a point - like substructure , parton or quark , is taken as the reason for `` scaling '' behaviour of hadron structure - functions , i.e. the absence of any `` scale '' is the consequence of point - like objects @xcite . along the bjorken s argument , and as we recall it in below , this scaling behaviour has a simple interpretation in light - cone point of view on the processes which are involved in dis .",
    "the story is the same for feynman s parton picture of dis experiment and the light - cone frame s cousin , the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) @xcite . by this simple interpretation of scaling in light - cone frame",
    "we hopefully have a constituent picture for hadrons reconcilable with qcd , and it is the reason for developing the light - cone formulation of qcd during the past years @xcite .",
    "the unpolarized cross - section of dis in the lowest order is given by k_0= l_w^ , with w_(p , q)&= & _",
    "^iqy p,|[j_(y),j_(0)]|p , , + l_&=&2(k_k_+k_k_- q^2 _ ) , q = k - k,q^2=-q^2<0 . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass of the nucleon and total energy respectively .",
    "the momenta are specified in the fig.1 . also , we define the useful parameters , = , x=,y=. note that parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are dimensionless . in the rest frame of nucleon ( target )",
    "we choose the z axis to be along the virtual photon momentum then we have p=(m,0,0,0),q=(,0,0,- ) . in the so - called bjorken limit , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath8=fixed",
    ", we have @xmath12 . now",
    "the statement of bjorken scaling is as following : up to a kinematical coefficient , the hadronic tensor @xmath13 depends only on the parameter @xmath8 and not on @xmath14 . to see this ,",
    "it is convenient to use light - cone variables @xmath15 with scalar product as @xmath16 .",
    "thus one writes [ osc ] w_~ dy^- ^iq^+y^- dy^+d^2y_t^iq^-y^+ p|j_(y)j_(0)|p . in the bjorken limit",
    "we have q^+-mx/=fixed , q^-=(2+mx)/ . in this limit",
    "the integrand of ( [ osc ] ) contains the rapidly oscillating factor @xmath17 which kills all contributions to the integral except for those where the integrand is singular .",
    "indeed the singularity of integrand comes from the current product at @xmath18 .",
    "in addition due to causality the integrand vanishes for @xmath19 .",
    "so the dominant part of the integral comes from @xmath20 .",
    "it explains the bjorken scaling , i.e. , the @xmath21 no longer exists at @xmath22 .",
    "now it is clear that the light - front coordinates play a distinguished role in the understanding of the scaling behaviour in dis experiments .",
    "the same result is also correct for feynman s parton description of dis and imf , the experimental realization of light - cone frame @xcite .",
    "according to string theory , d@xmath1-branes are @xmath1 dimensional objects defined as ( hyper)surfaces which can trap the ends of strings @xcite and therefore it is reasonable to take their dynamics as a proper effective theory for the bound - states of quarks and qcd - strings ( qcd electric fluxes ) .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of d - brane dynamics appears in their _",
    "coincident limit_. in the case of coinciding @xmath0 d@xmath1-branes their dynamics are captured by a @xmath3 ym theory dimensionally reduced to @xmath23 dimensions of d@xmath1-brane world - volume @xcite . in the case of d0-branes @xmath24 , the above dynamics reduces to quantum mechanics of matrices , because time is the only parameter in the world - line .",
    "a detailed procedure of constructing this matrix mechanics is presented in @xcite .",
    "the bosonic lagrangian resulted from the pure ym is @xcite arbitrary . ]",

    "@xmath29 s are in adjoint representation of @xmath3 and have the usual expansion @xmath30 , @xmath31 , .",
    "the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) is invariant under the residual gauge symmetry of unreduced ym theory .",
    "the transformations are : [ gst1 ] & & = uu^ , + a_0&&a_0=ua_0u^+iu_tu^ , where @xmath32 is an arbitrary time - dependent @xmath33 unitary matrix . under these transformations",
    "one can check that : [ gst2 ] d_t&&d_t = u(d_t)u^ , + d_td_t&&d_td_t = u(d_td_t)u^.    first let us search for d0-branes in the above lagrangian : + for each direction @xmath34 there are @xmath35 variables and not @xmath0 which one expects for @xmath0 particles .",
    "however there is an ansatz for the equations of motion which restricts the @xmath3 basis to its @xmath0 dimensional cartan subalgebra .",
    "this ansatz causes vanishing the potential and one finds the action of @xmath0 free particles , namely : [ 1.5 ] s = dt _ ( a)=1^n m_0 _ ( a)^2 . in this case",
    "the @xmath3 symmetry is broken to @xmath36 and the interpretation of @xmath0 remaining variables as the classical ( relative ) positions of @xmath0 particles is meaningful .",
    "the center of mass of d0-branes is represented by the trace of the @xmath29 matrices .    in the case of unbroken gauge symmetry",
    "the gauge transformations mix the entries of matrices and the interpretation of positions for d0-branes remains obscure @xcite . even in this case",
    "the center of mass is meaningful and the ambiguity about positions only remains for the relative positions of d0-branes . in unbroken phase",
    "the @xmath37 non - cartan elements of matrices have a stringy interpretation ; they govern the dynamics of low lying oscillations of strings stretched between d0-branes .",
    "the dependences of energy eigenvalues and the size of bound - states are notable . by the scalings @xcite t & & g_s^-1/3 t , + a_0 & & g_s^1/3 a_0 , + x & & g_s^1/3 x , one finds the relevant energy and size scales as [ scales ] e & ~ & g_s^1/3/l_s , + l_d+2&= & g_s^1/3l_s .",
    "the length scale @xmath38 should be the fundamental length scale of the covariant @xmath39 dimensional theory whose light - cone formulation is argued to be described by action ( [ 1.1 ] ) with longitudinal momentum as @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to assume in our case that @xmath38 ( for @xmath41 ) is the inverse of the 3 + 1 dimensional qcd mass scale , denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "differs from @xcite .",
    "there @xmath43 is taken as @xmath44 . ] in the weak coupling @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) one finds @xmath47 which allows to treat the bound - states of finite number of d0-branes as point - like objects in the transverse directions of the light - cone frame , , for finite @xmath0 , we are dealing with discrete - light - cone - quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite . we do not emphasize on this point later . ] and consequently one finds @xmath48 , which shows the invariance under lorentz transformation of this combination . as we will see in sec.6 the masses of the intermediate states in the scattering amplitude appear as @xmath49 .",
    "to calculate the effective potential between d0-branes one should find the effective action around a classical configuration .",
    "this work can be done by integrating over the quantum fluctuations in a path integral . for the diagonal classical configurations , classical representations of d0-branes , the quantum fluctuations which must be integrated over are the off - diagonal entries .",
    "this work is equivalent to integrating over the oscillations of the strings stretched between d0-branes .",
    "because here we deal with a gauge theory , and our interest is calculation around the classical field configuration , to obtain the effective action , it is convenient to use the background field method @xcite .    to calculate the effective action we write ( [ 1.1 ] ) in @xmath2 space - time dimensions in the form ( in the units @xmath50 and after the wick rotation @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) [ 3.1 ] l&=&m_0([x_,x_]^2 ) , , = 0,1, ... ,d , + x_0&=&i _ t + a_0,s = l dt , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are summed over by the euclidean metric .",
    "the one - loop effective action of ( [ 3.1 ] ) has been calculated several times ( e.g. see the appendix of @xcite ) and the result can be expressed as [ 3.5 ] ( dt)v(x_^cl ) =( p_^2_-2if_)- ( p_^2 ) , with @xmath55,\\;\\ ; f_{\\mu\\nu}\\;*\\equiv[f_{\\mu\\nu},*],\\;\\ ; f_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv[x_\\mu^{cl},x_\\nu^{cl}],\\ ] ] and [ 3.10 ] p_^2=-_t^2+_i=1^d p_i^2 , with the backgrounds @xmath56 .",
    "the second term in ( 4.2 ) is due to the ghosts associated with gauge symmetry .",
    "here we calculate the potential between two d0-branes at rest . the classical solution which represents two d0-branes in distance @xmath57",
    "can be introduced as [ 3.15 ] x_1^cl= ( ) , x_0^cl = i_t ( ) , + a_0^cl = x_i^cl=0,i=2, ... ,d .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath58 are 0 , 0 , @xmath60 .",
    "the operator @xmath61 is found to be [ 3.25 ] p_^2=-_t^21_4 + _ 3 ^ 2 , which is a harmonic oscillator operator whose frequency , reintroducing @xmath62 , is @xmath63 .",

    "the linear potential is the same of phenomenology interests , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "also it is the same which is consistent with spin - mass regge trajectories @xcite . by restoring the @xmath62",
    "the potential will be found to be [ 3.35 ] v(r)=4 ( ) which has the dimension @xmath70 . by comparison with regge model",
    "one can have an estimation for @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the above potential can be used to describe an effective theory for the relative dynamics of d0-branes as [ 3.36 ] s = dt ( ^2- 4 ( ) ) , which in the range of validity of one - loop approximation , mentioned in previous footnote , it is expected to be applicable . also by this action one obtains the energy scale as @xmath71 , as pointed in ( [ scales ] ) .",
    "the above action describes the dynamics in light - cone frame with the longitudinal momentum @xmath40 , and recalling ( [ scales ] ) we have @xmath72 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the two d0-brane interaction potential is also true for every pair inside a bound - states of d0-branes .",
    "so the effective action for @xmath0 d0-branes is found to be s = dt ( m_0_(a)=1^n _ ( a)^2- 4 ( ) _ ( a)>(b)=1^n ) . in a recent work @xcite , by taking the linear potential between quarks of a baryonic state in transverse directions of light - cone frame , the structure functions are obtained with a good agreement with observed ones .",
    "it is useful to relate the parameter @xmath73 in the potential with gauge theory parameters . to do this",
    "we need a string theoretic description of gauge theory , but in the light - cone frame .",
    "the nearest formulation we know for this is light - cone ",
    "lattice gauge theory ( lclgt ) @xcite . in lclgt",
    "one assumes time direction and one of the spatial directions , say @xmath74 , in continuum limit .",
    "the light - cone variables are defined as usual @xmath75 .",
    "other spatial directions naturally play the role of transverse directions of light - cone frame , which are assumed to be on a lattice in lclgt . due to existence of a continuous time @xmath76",
    ", there exists a hamiltonian formulation @xcite of the lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the relation between the linear confinement potential and gauge - lattice parameters is given by @xcite : v(r)~ |r| , with @xmath77 as the lattice spacing parameter in the transverse directions .",
    "comparing this with ( 4.9 ) leads to ~.       for two _ fast decaying _",
    "d0-branes one can again calculate the above potential .",
    "this work can be done by inserting for example a gaussian function for @xmath67 into the ( [ a ] ) .",
    "this work is equivalent to restricting the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath68 .",
    "having this in mind that eigenvalues of operators ( @xmath78 , ... ) represent the information corresponding to classical values of d0-branes space - time positions , here are different from their quantum mechanical analogue which due to the schrodinger s equation , are energy .",
    "] we find [ 3.40 ] v(r)&=&-2 ( ) _ 0^ _ -^ dk_0 ( ^ ) ^-s(k_0 ^ 2+r^2 ) + & = & -2 ( ) _ 0^ , in which we assumed that the d0-branes live around time zero .",
    "the last expression is infinite , but one can show that the infinite part is @xmath57-independent .",
    "one takes : = 2 ( ) _ 0^ , which is finite and so infinity of @xmath79 is @xmath57-independent .",
    "the last integral can not be calculated exactly , though numerical comparison with phenomenology is possible .",
    "the limit @xmath80 can be calculated exactly by recalling the relation : @xmath81 inserting @xmath82-function in ( [ 3.40 ] ) one finds : [ 3.50 ] v(r)~-2 ( ) _ 0^ ^-s(r^2)~r , which the last result is after extracting the @xmath57-independent infinity .",
    "this result is already consistent with phenomenology of heavy quarks @xcite , which we know their weak decay rates grow with @xmath83 . in the extreme limit @xmath84 ,",
    "in which the two d0-branes see each other `` instantaneously '' , one can take them as two d(-1)-branes ( d - instantons ) .",
    "the dynamics of d(-1)-branes are described by the action ( [ 3.1 ] ) but instead of the taking @xmath85 as @xmath68 one takes @xmath85 as a matrix which its eigenvalues represent the `` instants '' which d(-1)-branes occur .",
    "so the above logarithmic result also could be obtained in d(-1)-branes calculation by taking a classical solution as [ 3.45 ] x_1^cl= ( ) , x_0^cl= ( ) , a_0^cl = x_i^cl=0,i=2, ... ,d , which represents two d(-1)-branes appeared at time @xmath86 , in distance @xmath57 .",
    "a comment is in order : from phenomenological point of view , it is known that in some cases potentials like @xmath87 , with @xmath88 also have produced good results @xcite .",
    "this maybe can be included to our intermediate result ( [ 3.40 ] ) or logarithmic result by recalling the numerical relation @xmath89 , which is valid for a range of @xmath57 . ] ]",
    "to determine the color of an object its dynamics should be studied in presence of external fields . for a `` white ''",
    "extended object , the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "moves as a free particle in a uniform electric field .",
    "now we want to specify the color of the d0-branes bound - states . as we will see , although our formulation for dynamics of d0-branes in external ym fields seems incomplete , but there is a reasonable statement about `` whiteness '' of d0-branes bound - states .      in classical electrodynamics besides electromagnetic fields produced by different distributions of charges and currents",
    ", we also study the dynamics of a charged particle in regions of space where electromagnetic fields exist .",
    "there is a simple question : what are the problems arising when one studies chromodynamics in this level ?",
    "the main problem arises when one introduces sources and matches chromodynamics with dynamics of colored objects ( for example a colored particle ) . in case of electrodynamics",
    "there is a simple relation .",
    "for example the equation of motion of a charge particle with mass @xmath40 and charge @xmath90 is [ lf ] m_0=q(+ ) .",
    "the concept of gauge invariance at this level is understood as the invariance of equations of motion under gauge transformations , i.e. field strengths are invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "now , in the case of chromodynamics right - hand - side is a matrix and transforms as an object in adjoint representation under gauge group transformations , as =u u^ , =u u^. so the problem arises .",
    "as it is well - known for string theorists , now we have a good candidate for non - commutative coordinates which are the coordinates of coincident d0-branes .",
    "first one may rewrite ( 5.1 ) for `` matrix '' coordinates as m_0=q(+ ) , but it is not enough to have correct behaviour for the first side under gauge transformations . here",
    "the world - line gauge symmetry ( [ gst1 ] ) of d0-brane dynamics helps us , to write the generalized lorentz equation as , . ]",
    "[ gle ] m_0d_td_t = q(+d_t ) . by recalling the relation ( [ gst2 ] ) one observes that both sides have the same behaviour under gauge transformations .",
    "however , it seems that the picture is not complete yet .",
    "first , it is not clear what is the lagrangian formulation of this problem .",
    "secondly , the precise meaning of position dependences of field strengths should be clarified ( there is the same question for @xmath32 , the parameter of gauge transformation ) .",
    "now , the crucial observation is the decoupling of c.m",
    ". dynamics from non - abelian parts .",
    "it is because of trace nature of @xmath91 and @xmath92 parts . as we mentioned earlier the c.m .",
    "degree of freedom is described by the @xmath91 part of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "so the position and the momentum of c.m . can be obtained by a simple trace @xcite [ 2.55 ] _",
    "c.m . , _ c.m . .",
    "to investigate the kind and amount of the charge of an object its dynamics should be studied in absence of magnetic field ( @xmath93 ) and ( for extended objects ) in uniform electric field ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "so the c.m .",
    "equation of motion is m_0_c.m.=q_(1)0 ,    which the subscript ( 1 ) denotes that the corresponding electric field comes from the @xmath91 part of @xmath3 .",
    "it is understood that the dynamics of c.m .",
    "will not be affected by the non - abelian part of gauge group .",
    "it means that the c.m . is white with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "this behaviour of d0-branes bound - states is the same as that of hadrons .",
    "it means that each d0-brane feels the net effect of other d0-branes as the white - complement of its color . in other words , the field fluxes",
    "extracted from one d0-brane to the other ones are the same as the flux between a color and an anti - color , fig.2 . as we have shown in sec.4",
    ", there is a linear potential between each two static d0-branes , which is consistent with this flux - string picture .",
    "also , the number of d0-branes in the bound - state , @xmath0 , equals to that of baryons . as we mentioned before , recently @xcite the linear potential between the constituents of baryons , in the transverse directions of light - cone frame , has been used successfully to obtain the structure functions .    as the final note in this part",
    ", we remind that the dynamics presented by ( [ lf ] ) can be taken as for a massless particle in transverse directions in light - cone frame with longitudinal momentum , @xmath95 .",
    "the fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 are electromagnetic fields in transverse directions .",
    "we present the derivation of this in the appendix .",
    "as a consequence of asymptotic freedom , in a suddenly collision process quarks or partons are assumed to be free .",
    "so the probe , an electron or another quark , only interacts with the hadron constituents instead of the hadron as a whole @xcite .",
    "it is the same mechanism which results _ scaling _ behaviour in hadron structure functions .    with the above in mind it is reasonable to calculate the scattering amplitude between two individual d0-branes , to find an impression about the behaviour of the scattering amplitude of two hadrons which",
    "d0-branes are assumed as their quarks .",
    "also it is natural to assume that this result is for high energy - elastic regime of hadron collisions .",
    "here we use the result of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the quantum travelling of d0-branes can be understood by the field theory feynman graphs and corresponding amplitudes in the light - cone frame . in the following",
    "we review the approach to calculate the amplitude .",
    "we concentrate on the limit @xmath98 . in this limit to have a finite energy one has [ 4.1 ] [ x_i , x_j]=0,i , j , and consequently the potential term in the action vanishes .",
    "so , d0-branes do not interact and the `` classical action '' reduces to the action of @xmath0 free particles .",
    "we take this classical action also in the quantum case too , it is equivalent to the assumption that two quarks in two spatially well separated hadrons do not interact with each other . since hadrons are white one can trust this assumption .",
    "however , the above observation fails when d0-branes arrive each other .",
    "when two d0-branes come very near each other two eigenvalues of @xmath99 matrices will be equal and the corresponding off - diagonal elements can get non - zero values .",
    "this is the same story of gauge symmetry enhancement .",
    "the fluctuations of these off - diagonal elements are responsible for the interaction between d0-branes in bound - states .    in the coincident limit",
    "the dynamics is complicated .",

    "in this section we discuss some relevant issues : 1 ) large-@xmath0 limit , 2 ) quark , gauge theory and gravity solutions relations and also 3 ) non - commutativity .",

    "we try to work out the hamiltonian formulation , and then the above mentioned properties are followed by the same reasoning of @xcite . , the heavy quark theory of @xcite is a good approximation for the transverse dynamics of d0-branes . ]    in sec.4 the effective theory for d0-branes were obtained to be s = dt ( m_0_(a)=1^n _ ( a)^2- 4 ( ) _ ( a)>(b)=1^n ) .",
    "also we have found the relation between the @xmath62 parameter and the coupling constant of gauge theory by comparing it to lclgt , namely @xmath146 where @xmath77 is the lattice spacing parameter .",
    "it is known that it is more convenient to replace the coupling constant by @xmath147 at large-@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "so the action in terms of new parameters is s = dt ( m_0_(a)=1^n _ ( a)^2- 4 ( ) _ ( a),(b)=1^n |_(a)-_(b)| ) , and the associated hamiltonian is the same used in @xcite except for the potential term , which is coulomb one there .",
    "here we just check the mass of baryons at large-@xmath0 .",
    "the kinetic term of c.m . ,",
    "@xmath148 , grows with @xmath0 , and the net potential for each d0-brane takes a factor @xmath149 due to pair interactions .",
    "so the potential term at large-@xmath0 grows like n(n-1)~n .",
    "it results that the energy grows as @xmath150 at large-@xmath0 . from the point of view of light - cone frame",
    "the energy is @xmath151 .",
    "the total longitudinal momentum of this bound - state is @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the longitudinal momentum of one d0-brane .",
    "consequently , the invariant mass @xmath6 is m^2=2p^+p^^2~n^2m~n .",
    "d@xmath1-branes are @xmath1 dimensional schwartzschild solutions of low energy effective field theories of string theories .- form field .",
    "] so any proposal for equivalence between them and quarks , or at least between their dynamics and quarks dynamics , may need justification at first . here",
    "we recall some string theoretic related issues shortly , and also try to present ( maybe ) a non - string theoretic related feature then .",
    "as mentioned , d - branes are gravity solutions . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the dynamics of these objects are captured by a gauge theory .",
    "it is one of the closest connections between gauge theories and gravity , which has been revealed by string theory . through this relation between the dynamics of an extended object and a gauge theory ,",
    "many studies have been done to develop understanding of gauge theory dynamics .",
    "one of the recent progresses in this area is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , to relate gauge theory dynamics at large t hooft coupling ( @xmath154 ) to gravity in the anti - de sitter background .",
    "the relation between gauge theory and gravity is also studied at the level of equations of motion . both gravity and non - abelian gauge theories ,",
    "though in different orders , have nonlinear equations of motion . it is discovered that both pure gauge theories and gauge theories with matter have schwartzschild - like solutions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . by",
    "schwartzschild - like we mean the similarity between `` connections '' in gauge theories ( known as gauge fields @xmath155 ) and gravity ( known as connection coefficients @xmath156 ) . in the case of @xmath157 gauge theory with massless scalar matter field",
    "the solution is found to be @xcite [ bgs ] a^(a)_i&= & _ ( a)ij[1-k(r ) ] , + a^(a)_0&= & j(r ) , + ^(a)&= & h(r ) , with k(r)&= & , j(r)= , + h(r)&=&,a^2-b^2=1 . the gauge fields behaviour is comparable with connection coefficients in schwartzschild solution as ^t_rt= , ^r_rr=-,k=2gm .",
    "here we just review some properties of the solution ( [ bgs ] ) @xcite .",
    "first , both the gauge and scalar fields are singular at the radius @xmath158 .",
    "further , by calculating electric and magnetic fields one sees that both are singular at @xmath159 .",
    "therefore a particle , which carries an @xmath157 charge , becomes confined if it crosses into the region @xmath160 .",
    "the singularity of field strengths at @xmath159 here is different from that of gravity schwartzschild solution , which can be removed by a suitable choice of coordinates .",
    "based on this picture of confinement of a charge in @xmath160 region , a model for confinement of gauge theories has been presented in @xcite .",
    "also the solution have monopole magnetic charge .",
    "this can be seen from the generalized t hooft s field strength : = _ ( ^(a)w^(a ) _ ) -_(^(a)w^(a)_)- ^(a)(b)(c)^(a)(_^(b))(_^(c ) ) , with @xmath161 .",
    "hence , for magnetic field we find _",
    "i=_ijk_ij=- , which is the magnetic field of a point monopole with charge @xmath162 .",
    "one can also find the electric field : _",
    "i=-_0i= = , which at @xmath163 does not have the behaviour of prasad - sommerfield s solution ( @xmath164 ) ; and the interpretation of a net electric charge near origin is impossible .",
    "so this solution seems more like a magnetic monopole , and its relation to a `` quark '' ( a source of electric field ) is out of reach ; but here the idea of mantonen - olive duality , which changes the role of solitonic solutions with the fundamental objects seems considerable .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of d - branes is the non - commutativity of their relative coordinates .",
    "if the model of this paper has some relation with nature , the question will be about a possible justification for this non - commutativity . to resolve this question",
    "one may consider the following prescription : _ the structure of space - time has to be in correspondence and consistent with the propagation of fields_. in this way one finds the space - time coordinates as @xmath165 4-vector which behaves like electromagnetic field @xmath166 4-vector ( spin 1 ) under the boost transformations .",
    "this is just the same idea of special relativity to change the concept of space - time to be consistent with the maxwell equations .",
    "also in this way supersymmetry is a natural continuation of the special relativity program : adding spin @xmath167 sector to the coordinates of space - time , as the representative of the fermions of nature .",
    "this leads one to the space - time formulation of the supersymmetric theories , and in the same way ferminos are introduced into the bosonic string theory .",
    "now , what may be modified if nature has non - abelian ( non - commutative ) gauge fields ? in the present nature non - abelian gauge fields can not make spatially long coherent states ; they are confined or too heavy .",
    "but the picture may be changed inside a hadron .",
    "in fact recent developments of string theories sound this change and it is understood that non - commutative coordinates and non - abelian gauge fields are two sides of one coin . as we discussed , the interaction between d - branes is the result of path - integrations over fluctuations of the non - commutative parts of coordinates .",
    "it means that in this picture `` non - commutative '' fluctuations of space - time are the source of `` non - abelian '' interactions .",
    "this picture may justify involving the non - commutative coordinates in a study of bound - states of quarks and gluons .",
    "one may summarize this idea as in the below table .",

    "sheikh - jabbari s comments on the revised version are deeply acknowledged .",
    "finally i am grateful to the referee of epj.c .",
    ", for his / her crucial comments .",
    "we just follow the steps of @xcite in going to light - cone frame .",
    "the classical action is s =- m_1 ^ 2 d+qa_^d , with the momentum as p^-=m -qa^. consequently one finds the constraints for momenta and canonical hamiltonian ( p^+qa^)(p_+qa_)=m^2 , + h_c =- p_^-l0 . the total hamiltonian will be found to be h_t=((p^+qa^)^2-m^2 ) , with @xmath168 as lagrange multiplier , and canonical poisson bracket as @xmath169 .",
    "so one finds that the dynamics has gauge symmetry ( reparametrization invariance ) and to find the lagrange multiplier one should fix the gauge , by condition as @xmath170 .",
