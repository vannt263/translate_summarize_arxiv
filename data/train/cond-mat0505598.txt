    "although it takes the repulsion into account by a factor @xmath6 which is decreasing with increasing coupling constant @xmath3 , the saturation of @xmath7 can not be seen in this solution . from the physical point of view , in a realistic description for large densities , the particle density must saturate because there is a finite scattering volume around each particle . furthermore , for increasing particle density , the condensate density should reach a maximum and for even larger densities , decrease again until its total destruction , because of the increasing interparticle interaction .",
    "this behaviour has also been found by variational perturbation theory @xcite and diffusion monte carlo calculations @xcite . in other words , the strong effect of the repulsion in a dense condensate",
    "is not really described by the conventional gp eq . in order to describe condensates at higher densities ,",
    "the second order term in the low - density expansion of the energy density has been taken into account which lead to a modified gp theory @xcite .",
    "although in many experimentally realized situations the bec is in the weakly interacting regime where it is well described by gp theory , it might be possible to reach the strongly interacting regime .",
    "the main problem at high particle densities is the instability of the bose gas by the formation of molecules due to three - particle interactions @xcite . here",
    ", we will assume that molecule formation does not occur .",
    "this might be unrealistic for some systems , but in others it is not , e.g. for bose gases in optical lattices .",
    "it has been shown that the slave - boson approach to a hard - core bose gas provides a mean - field eq .",
    ", similar to the gp eq .",
    ", that leads to a saturation of the condensate @xmath8 @xcite . here",
    "we will discuss a simplified version of this mean - field equation which is the same type of nonlinear schrdinger eq .",
    "like in the gp approach . however , in contrast to the latter the parameters are renormalized such that eq .",

    "we use this approach to calculate the condensate density profile of a trapped bec .",
    "the formation of vortices in a rotating condensate is understood as a local destruction of the condensate . from the depletion effect due to strong interaction",
    "it can be anticipated that the tendency of vortex formation is enhanced in a dense bose gas .",
    "this implies a reduction of the critical angular velocity @xmath12 with increasing density by the interaction .",
    "vortex formation in rotating traps in the region beyond the validity of gp has also been studied by the modified gp theory and by variational monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we survey the results of the slave - boson approach for a hard - core bose gas on a lattice and derive a corresponding mean field theory for a continuous system in an external trap potential .",
    "then we derive the renormalized gp eq . and evaluate solutions with and without a straight vortex and determine the critical angular velocity for the vortex formation .",
    "the slave - boson representation of a strongly interacting bose gas is based on the idea that the bosons fill the space with finite density , where each particle occupies a lattice cell related to a sphere with radius @xmath13 ( @xmath14-wave scattering length ) @xcite .",

    "the @xmath32 function enforces the constraint that each lattice site is either singly occupied or empty but excludes a multiple occupation .",
    "a similar approach has been applied to the bose - hubbard model which allows multiple occupation , by introducing additional fields , one for each occupation number @xcite .",
