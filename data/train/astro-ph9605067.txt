    "understanding the formation of the large - scale structure ( lss ) in the universe is one of the most important problems in modern cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . on scales of galaxies complex nonlinear physical processes like turbulence , cooling and heating of the gas , star formation and supernova explosions ,",
    "determine the shape and other properties of objects .",
    "however , on the scale of superclusters these processes become considerably less important and it is reasonable to assume that primarily gravity shapes the structures .",
    "in addition , a variety of observational evidence supports the hypothesis that most of the mass in the universe is in the form of weakly interacting particles that feel only gravity . therefore , a simple physical model assuming that the universe is filled with a cold dust - like gas only interacting gravitationally is most often used for studying the lss formation .",
    "the baryonic component plays no crucial role except on the scale of galaxies .",
    "when the amplitude of the density fluctuations is small , their growth is adequately described by the linear theory . however , as soon as the amplitude of the perturbations reaches the order of unity ( @xmath0 ^ 2   \\right>^{1/2 } \\approx 1 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the density field and @xmath2 its mean ) the linear theory breaks down ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . the most widespread method to deal with the complex dynamics at the nonlinear stage is to run n - body simulations generating the initial condition as a realization of a gaussian random process ( @xcite ) . in n - body simulations of this type the gravitational forces generated by the density distribution is calculated at each time step .",
    "the trajectory of every particle is integrated in a self - consistently varying gravitational field .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations have played the most significant role in testing ( and in most cases rejecting ) the models for dark matter .",
    "here we are interested in a different aspect of the problem of the lss formation .",
    "we are trying to formulate simple physical _ macroscopic _ principles controlling the nonlinear stage of gravitational clustering .",
    "long ago zeldovich ( 1970 ) suggested a very elegant , analytical approximation to describe the beginning of the nonlinear stage in cosmological scenarios assuming smooth initial conditions .",
    "quantitatively it can be expressed as a requirement that the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations has a steep cutoff on small scales ( steeper than @xmath3 ) .",
    "mathematically , the zeldovich approximation ( za ) is a one step mapping from the lagrangian space into the eulerian space at a time @xmath4 given by @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the eulerian and lagrangian coordinates , respectively ; @xmath8 is the scale factor describing the homogeneous expansion of the universe ; @xmath9 is a known function of time describing the growth of perturbations ; and @xmath10 is the potential of the initial velocity field : @xmath11 . with the aid of the above mapping",
    "one can calculate the density at the final time @xmath12 using the conservation of mass .",
    "however , cosmological observations almost certainly exclude scenarios having no perturbations on small scales .",
    "small scale power is required to explain the existence of quasars and galaxies at very high redshifts .",
    "two modifications  the truncated zeldovich approximation ( tza ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the adhesion approximation ( aa ) ( @xcite)have been suggested in an attempt to extend the scope of the za and to make it more useful for general cosmological scenarios ( for a brief review see e.g.  @xcite and for more exhaustive discussion of various approximations see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison with gravitational n - body simulations shows that these two approximations fairly accurately describe nonlinear gravitational clustering ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "here we describe another approximation to the nonlinear gravitational evolution of the density and velocity perturbations which is numerically almost as simple as the za but completely universal and much superior to any approximation method suggested so far .",
    "it consists of two elements :    * a transformation of variables and * an assumption that in the dense regions the local gravitational interaction can be approximated by the diffusion of a generalized momentum ( see below for a definition of the generalized momentum ) .",
    "the latter assumption is similar to the aa but in this model the generalized momentum is locally conserved .",
    "it is well known that one can exclude many effects of the homogeneous and isotropic expansion of the universe by introducing the comoving coordinate @xmath13 and peculiar velocity @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the physical velocity and @xmath16 is the hubble parameter characterizing the rate of expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition , it is convenient to parameterize time by @xmath17 which describes the growth of perturbations , and rescale the density and peculiar velocity ( @xcite ) by @xmath18 in terms of the new variables the dynamics of gravitational clustering is described by ( i ) the conservation of mass , ( ii ) a dynamical equation analogous to the euler equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimensionless mean density of the universe , and ( iii ) an equation for the gravitational field @xmath21 analogous to the poisson equation ( for derivations see e.g. @xcite ) .    as in the za",
    "the coma assumes that the gravitational force is approximated by the velocity @xmath22 which sets the right hand side of eq.[[eq : euler - d ] ] to zero .",
    "thus , on large scales the model mimics the dynamics of a self - gravitating medium by the effectively kinematic model of non - interacting medium .",
    "however , on small scales the approximation assumes that particles inelastically collide resulting in the exchange and diffusion of the generalized momentum defined as @xmath23 which mimics the effects of gravity in dense regions ( @xcite ) .    in the aa the right hand side of eq.[[eq : euler - d ] ] is supplemented by the viscosity term resulting in burgers equation @xmath24 in the aa @xmath25 is assumed to be constant which results in the violation of the momentum conservation ( @xcite ) and in this respect the model is not physical .",
    "the coma assumes physical viscosity described by the equation similar to the navier - stokes equation ( here we ignore the 2nd viscosity ) @xmath26 \\label{eq : navier}.\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the dynamical viscosity .",
    "the navier - stokes equation conserves the linear momentum automatically but does not have an analytical solution in the general case ; also it may generate vorticity .    according to the za in the single stream flow regime",
    "each particle moves along straight line with constant velocity .",
    "however , as soon as a particle enters a multi - stream flow region its trajectory becomes very complex , resembling a random walk .",
    "collectively this type of motion can be labeled as a sort of violent relaxation ( @xcite ) and can be roughly approximated by the diffusion of the momentum .",
    "it is convenient to split the force exerting on the particle into two parts : the first component represents its interaction with the other particles of the clump of which it is a member and the second represents its interaction with particles that belong to other clumps or voids .",
    "one can reasonably assume that the irregular component of the motion is mostly determined by the gravitational force induced by the particles from the same clump .",
    "if so , the momentum of the clump must be approximately conserved in the interaction of this type .",
    "the change of the momentum of the clump is due to interaction with the surrounding matter that can be roughly described by eq.[4 ] . in practice ,",
    "the diffusion of momentum is important in all regions of high density ( filaments and pancakes ) and aids in preventing the formation of multi - stream flows as in the aa .",
    "the major physical difference between the coma and aa consists in that the coma conserves momentum locally and the aa , based on burgers equations , does not ( instead , the latter conserves the velocity ) .",
    "we believe that this an advantage of the coma .",
    "another advantage of the coma is mainly practical .",
    "the numerical code realizing the model is extremely simple and efficient .",
    "it operates with the density and velocity distributions ( no particles ! ) on a cubic grid in the eulerian space : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . at each time step",
    "it calculates the flows of mass and momentum from a mesh cell to its neighbors and computes the new density and velocity fields on the grid using a cloud - in - cell algorithm ( see e.g. @xcite ) thereby explicitly conserving the mass and the generalized momentum ( simulation of perfectly inelastic collisions ) .",
    "thus , one circumvents the problem of having to compute the gravitational force after each time step .",
    "a full description of the code as well as the code itself will be published elsewhere ; here we list its major features .",
    "the algorithm implementing the new approximation is :    * _ universal _ in terms of the initial and boundary conditions as well as the shape of the computational box , provided that the initial velocity field is somehow generated ; * _ extremely simple _ both conceptually and practically ; * _ very economical _ in terms of memory ( just four arrays , each as big as the size of the box , are sufficient to implement the algorithm ) ; * _ very fast _ ; and * local , therefore _ 100% parallelizable_.    generalization of the algorithm to deal with particles , rather than densities on the grid , as well as introducing partially inelastic collisions is straightforward but would require additional memory and slightly slow down the code .",
    "the only disadvantage of the coma ( compared to the aa ) is that it does not have an analytic solution .",
    "in order to test the strength of our approximate model we compare it with gravitational n - body simulations .",
    "the n - body simulations are performed using @xmath30 particles on a @xmath30 mesh with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations is assumed to be a simple power law ( @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier transform of the density contrast @xmath33 ) covering the range @xmath34",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the initial fluctuations are evolved gravitationally and comparisons are made when different scales , determined by the parameter @xmath38 ( defined by the equation @xmath39 ) , go nonlinear : @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( in units of the fundamental frequency @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the size of the box ) .",
    "for a detailed discussion of the n - body simulations see @xcite . at each epoch",
    "the density field is computed on a reduced grid of size 64@xmath44 by a cloud - in - cell method .",
    "we run the model code with identical initial conditions and compare its results with those of n - body simulations at different stages . here",
    "we illustrate this comparison for three different values of the power - law index of the spectrum of fluctuations , namely , @xmath45 @xmath36 and @xmath46 and at two stages @xmath47 and @xmath41 . although it is unlikely that such power - law models can explain the real universe , they serve as toy models to understand generic features of gravitational instability .",
    "the following normalizations provide a rough idea of the scales involved and how such toy models may relate to the real universe .",
    "one can view the density fields corresponding to different stages in the evolution of such power law density fluctuations as equivalent to the density distribution at the present epoch but obtained after smoothing with a top - hat filter of progressively smaller radii @xmath48 with smaller smoothing lengths corresponding to later epochs .",
    "for instance , the epochs @xmath47 and @xmath41 correspond to smoothing radii @xmath49 , and @xmath50 respectively , within volumes @xmath51 , and @xmath52    [ h ! ]    = 5.0 in    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the n - body density distributions ( open circles ) with those obtained using the coma ( crosses ) in a typical two - dimensional slice , one mesh size thick , in the @xmath53 case , when the scale of nonlinearity corresponds to @xmath54 the panels show sites of density contrast ( @xmath33 ) larger than a certain threshold ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "a filled square is a site where both the n - body and model densities are larger than the threshold .",
    "one can see that there is generally a good overall agreement between the two distributions at nonlinear but not extremely high density thresholds .",
    "however , the coma shows a rather smoother distribution and the density peaks that it produces are somewhat lower , especially at higher densities . this behavior is not unexpected : local nonlinear gravitational effects , ignored by the coma , make the density distribution more clumpy and the clumps are more compact .",
    "a detailed comparison shows that the vast majority of density peaks in the n - body simulations have their counterparts in the coma often shifted by a couple of mesh sites and of slightly lower amplitudes . in order to quantify the similarities and discrepancies of the two density distributions in fig .",
    "2    [ h ! ]    = 5.0 in    we plot the power spectra ( left panels ) and probability distribution functions ( right panels ) of the n - body ( solid lines ) and the coma ( dashed line ) density fields , for three values of the power - law index @xmath45 @xmath36 and @xmath46 ( panels from top to bottom ) and two epochs @xmath47 ( bottom pair of curves ) and @xmath41 ( top pair of curves ) . comparisons of the power spectra show that the coma does not have enough power on small scales which is obviously related to a relative smoothness of the density fields in the coma .",
    "similarly , the density distribution functions show that when @xmath56 sites with densities above @xmath57 ( in units of the mean density ) are less abundant in the coma . however , at a later stage when @xmath58 the coma density distribution functions reproduce the n - body distribution correctly up to densities @xmath59 , but at larger densities ( not shown ) they again fall down faster than the ones in the n - body simulations .",
    "a similar comparison of n - body with other successful models , such as the aa or the tza , does not reveal as great an agreement as between coma and n - body ( @xcite ) .",
    "summarizing , we conclude that the proposed approximation mimics the large - scale gravitational evolution at late nonlinear stages quite well ( positions of clumps , filaments , pancakes )  better than any other known approximation .",
    "this implies that the two simple assumptions :    * the generalized gravitational force on large scales ( @xmath60 ) equals the velocity : @xmath61 and * the conservation of mass and the local ( @xmath62 ) conservation of the generalized momentum , @xmath63 , +      in a very general sense the coma falls in the class of sticky particle methods used in the numerical hydrodynamics and also resembles the lattice gas models used in modeling turbulence and similar phenomena .",
    "an interesting question is whether the coma guarantees complete hierarchical clustering or not . due to numerical errors",
    "some small clumps may miss merging with the larger ones passing by without the collision .",
    "we have not seen this phenomena in our simulations and believe that it should not be a serious problem for the method .",
    "we believe that after a thorough testing the approximation can be a practical tool for cosmological studies of large - scale processes which do not require a resolution better than a few @xmath64 such as large - scale streaming velocities , spatial distribution of rich clusters of galaxies , statistics of voids , etc . in such low resolution calculations",
    "the coma can be more efficient than n - body simulations if very large volumes and large statistical ensembles are required .",
