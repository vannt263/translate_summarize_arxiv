    "the extraction of the decay constants of ground - state vector mesons within the method of qcd sum rules @xcite is based on the analysis of the two - point correlation function @xmath7 of the vector heavy ",

    ", @xmath17 is the mass , @xmath18 the decay constant , and @xmath19 the polarization vector of the vector meson @xmath20 under study : @xmath21 for the correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) , @xmath22 is the physical continuum threshold , wherein @xmath23 denotes the mass of the pseudoscalar meson containing @xmath8 . for large values of @xmath14 ,",
    "the ground state dominates the correlator and thus its properties may be calculated from the correlation function ( [ 1.1 ] ) .    in perturbation theory , the correlation function",
    "is obtained as expansion in powers of the strong coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "the best known three - loop perturbative spectral density has been calculated in @xcite in terms of the _ pole _",
    "mass  of the heavy quark @xmath8 ( called @xmath25 here ) and for a massless second quark [ @xmath26 is the running coupling constant in the  @xmath2 scheme ] : @xmath27 for two massive quarks , the two - loop spectral density in terms of their pole masses was obtained in @xcite .    however , already for the case of the pseudoscalar correlator it was found that the perturbative expansion in terms of the heavy - quark pole mass does not exhibit any sign of convergence ; this problem was cured by rearranging the perturbative expansion in terms of the corresponding running @xmath2 mass @xcite .",
    "we show that precisely the same happens in the case of the vector correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "another subtlety  related to the truncation of the perturbative expansion  is the unphysical dependence of the obtained ground - state parameters on the renormalization scale @xmath28 : of course , the full correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) does not depend on @xmath28 ; however , both the perturbative expansion truncated at fixed order in @xmath29 and the truncated power corrections @xmath30 depend on @xmath28 .",
    "for the pseudoscalar - meson decay constants , this dependence was found to be rather mild @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as we shall demonstrate in this analysis , for the vector - meson decay constants the @xmath28 dependence is rather pronounced ; this leads to a larger corresponding error in the decay constants of vector mesons obtained from qcd sum rules .",
    "furthermore , the truncated operator product expansion ( ope ) does not allow one to calculate the correlator for sufficiently large @xmath14 , such that the continuum states give a sizable contribution to @xmath15 in the corresponding @xmath14-range .",
    "in order to get rid of the continuum contribution , the concept of duality is invoked : perturbative - qcd spectral density @xmath31 and hadron spectral density @xmath32 resemble each other at large values of @xmath33 ; thus , for sufficiently large values of the parameter @xmath34 , ( far ) above the resonance region , one arrives at the duality relation @xmath35 now , in order to express the continuum contribution in terms of the perturbative contribution , this relationship should be extended down to the hadronic threshold @xmath36 . however , the spectral densities @xmath31 and @xmath37 are obviously different in the region near @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , one can only expect to obtain a relation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is different from the physical threshold @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , for the same reason which causes @xmath41 , @xmath40 must be a function of the parameter @xmath14 @xcite . by virtue of ( [ duality ] ) , we may rewrite the sum rule ( [ pitau ] ) as @xmath42 we refer to the right - hand side of this equation as the _ dual correlator _ and to the @xmath14-dependent effective threshold that corresponds to the true values of the ground - state parameters in the left - hand side of ( [ sr ] ) as the _ exact effective threshold _ ; by definition , the exact effective threshold makes eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) an identity . one essential property of the exact effective threshold should be mentioned : whereas the exact correlation function and its truncated ope have very different energy dependences in the minkowski space , after performing the borel transform @xmath13 , the complicated energy dependence of the exact correlation function leads to only a weak @xmath14-dependence of the exact effective threshold .",
    "this feature opens the possibility to find realistic approximations to this exact @xmath14-dependent threshold and to obtain in this way reliable estimates for the bound - state parameters .",
    "obviously , the exact effective threshold is unknown .",
    "thus , the extraction of the decay constant requires , in addition to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as further input , a criterion for obtaining an approximation to the exact effective threshold . in @xcite",
    "we developed the algorithm for fixing @xmath40 which allows one to reliably extract the ground - state parameters on the basis of ( i ) an accurate ope for the green functions and ( ii ) the known value of the ground - state mass .    we shall demonstrate that qcd sum rules armed with this algorithm allow a very satisfactory extraction of the vector - meson decay constants , with an accuracy that is certainly competitive to that found using lattice qcd .",
    "we start with the ope for the correlation function ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "we may use the perturbative spectral density @xmath45 of @xcite in terms of the pole mass  of the heavy quark .",
    "an alternative option is to reorganize the perturbative expansion  in terms of the running @xmath46 mass ; the relevant analytic expressions are given in @xcite , see also the discussion in the appendix .",
    "figure  [ plot:1 ] illustrates the sum - rule estimates for @xmath47 arising from ( [ sr ] ) for these two choices of the @xmath48-quark mass : the pole mass @xmath49 and the running @xmath46 mass @xmath50 .",
    "the numerical ope - parameter values entering this game read  @xcite @xmath51 the pole mass , recomputed from the @xmath52 relation between @xmath53 and @xmath49 @xcite , reads @xmath54 .",
    "the sum - rule estimates shown in fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] are obtained for a @xmath14-independent effective threshold @xmath55 .",
    "its values , different for pole - mass ope and @xmath2-mass ope , are found by requiring maximal stability of the extracted decay constant in the chosen borel window ( as detailed in sect .",
    "let us emphasize that , for the moment , a _ constant _ effective threshold and the stability criterion for determining its numerical value are adopted only for illustration : as we have demonstrated in many examples @xcite , using a constant effective threshold provides rather inaccurate estimates for the decay constant and does not allow one to probe the systematic error of this extraction .    nevertheless , the results of fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] illustrate some of the essential features of the extraction procedures .",
    "first , using the pole - mass ope , one observes no hierarchy of the perturbative contributions to the dual correlator ",
    "the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 contributions have the same size .",
    "obviously , there is no reason to expect the unknown higher - order perturbative corrections to be small ; the pole - mass ope truncated at order @xmath58 and the corresponding ground - state parameters suffer from large uncertainties . on the other hand , reorganizing the perturbative expansion in terms of the @xmath2 mass of the heavy quark leads to a clear hierarchy and allows a reliable extraction of the ground - state parameters .",
    "this is precisely the same feature that has been observed for  the pseudoscalar correlator .",
    "second , there is a huge numerical difference between the decay constants obtained using the pole - mass ope and the running - mass ope if one compares calculations obtained for the values of @xmath59 and its pole - mass @xmath58 counterpartner given above .",
    "however , comparing the results of the truncated pole - mass and running - mass ope requires some caution , as the perturbative expansion of the pole mass in terms of the running mass displays its asymptotic nature already at lowest orders @xcite : @xmath60 , with @xmath61 . assigning the uncertainty of the pole - mass value that corresponds to a specific running - mass value as , e.g. , the size of the last included term in the perturbative relation , in our case of the @xmath58 term , amounts to a 15% uncertainty in @xmath49 .",
    "due to a large sensitivity of the extracted decay constant to the precise value of the charm - quark mass , the uncertainty of 15% in @xmath49 leads to a 100% uncertainty in the dual pole - mass correlator .",
    "with such an uncertainty , the results obtained from the pole - mass and the running - mass ope in fig .  [ plot:1 ] are compatible with each other , but suggest that the accuracy of the @xmath58-truncated pole - mass ope is rather bad .",
    "we therefore make use of the ope in terms of the running @xmath2 mass for the analysis of @xmath18 . accordingly , henceforth the quark masses @xmath9 and @xmath11 , and the strong coupling @xmath29 denote the @xmath2 running quantities .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our results for the @xmath1-meson decay constant may be summarized as [ @xmath62 @xmath63 \\mbox{mev}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly to @xmath47 , also the extracted decay constant of @xmath1 exhibits a rather strong and almost linear @xmath28 dependence ( see fig .",
    "[ plot : fv_vs_mu]b ) which , for average values of the other ope parameters , may be parameterized as @xmath64 , \\qquad \\mu^*=1.94\\mbox { gev}.\\ ] ] for comparison , the @xmath28 dependence and the average scale @xmath65 for @xmath66 from @xcite is also given : @xmath67 , \\qquad \\mu^*=1.52\\mbox { gev}.\\ ] ] notice that @xmath66 is extremely stable with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "this is an effect of an almost precise cancellation between the  @xmath28 dependencies of the dual perturbative and the condensate contributions .",
    "again , for gaussian distributions of all ope parameters and a flat distribution in @xmath28 in the range @xmath68 , we find a nearly gaussian distribution of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ plot : bootstrap ] which yields @xmath70 the composition of the ope error reads : 10.8 mev are due to the variation of the scale @xmath28 , 19.5 mev are caused by the error of strange - quark condensate , 12.5 mev by the error of @xmath59 , 6.4 mev by the gluon condensate , 1.7 mev by the strange - quark mass , and 1.4 mev by @xmath71 .",
    "higher condensates contribute 2 mev to this uncertainty .",
    "our result ( [ fdv_constant ] ) is in good agreement with @xmath72 mev from lattice qcd @xcite .    making use of our result for @xmath66 from @xcite",
    ", we obtain , for the ratio of the vector and the pseudoscalar decay constants , @xmath73 the ope uncertainty in this ratio is dominated by the errors arising from the @xmath28 dependence ( 0.043 ) and the gluon condensate ( 0.026 ) .",
    "finally , for the ratio of the @xmath74 and @xmath0 decay constants , we get @xmath75 the error here arises mainly from the errors in the strange - quark mass and the condensates ratio @xmath76 .",
    "the value ( [ ratiodv ] ) is slightly larger than but not in disagreement with the lattice result @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "exploiting the tools offered by qcd sum rules , we analyzed in great detail the decay constants of charmed vector mesons , paying special attention to the involved uncertainties of the predicted decay - constant values : the ope error ( related to the precision with which the qcd parameters are known ) and the systematic error intrinsic to the sum - rule approach as a whole ( reflecting the limited accuracy of the extraction procedure ) .",
    "we thus gained important insights :    * as was already noted in the case of heavy pseudoscalar mesons @xcite , also for the vector correlator the perturbative expansion in terms of the heavy - quark pole - mass does not seem to converge whereas reorganizing it in terms of the corresponding running mass leads to a clear hierachy of the perturbative contributions .",
    "* the dependence of the vector correlator , known at three - loop accuracy , on the renormalization scale @xmath28 turns  out to be sizeably stronger compared to the pseudoscalar correlator . respectively , the error related to the remaining scale dependence of the vector - meson decay constant proves to be twice as large as that for pseudoscalar - meson decay constant .",
    "* we allowed for a borel - parameter - dependent effective threshold for the decay - constant extractions .",
    "obviously , such a @xmath14-dependent effective threshold visibly improves the stability of the dual mass in the borel window .",
    "this means that the dual correlator is much less contaminated by excited states than the one inferred upon  confining oneself to @xmath14-independent effective thresholds .",
    "we thus get , as our estimates for the vector - meson decay constants , @xmath78 and , for the various ratios of decay constants , @xmath79 the ope uncertainties in the decay constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and in the above ratios are , to large extent , due  to the remaining dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath28 . + our predictions agree well with those from lattice qcd , @xmath80 and @xmath81  @xcite . + our results are in agreement with the recent estimates presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also make use of our idea of a @xmath14-dependent effective threshold .",
    "however , in our opinion , the estimates of @xcite are not fully trustworthy : first , the ope used in @xcite contained errors which we correct ( see ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) ) ; second , the authors of @xcite do not take properly into account the @xmath14-dependence of the effectve threshold when calculating the dual mass .",
    "+ we stress that our algorithm for fixing @xmath14-dependent effective thresholds allows us to provide , in addition to the ope errors , also the systematic errors intrinsic to the qcd sum - rule technique . although not entirely rigorous in the mathematical sense , our algorithm for obtaining the systematic errors has been verified in several examples within quantum mechanics , and proved to work well for decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the good news is that the systematic uncertainty turns out to be small and to be under control . *",
    "the @xmath14-dependent thresholds entail a visible shift in the sum - rule predictions for the decay constants of charmed vector mesons , increasing their numerical values by roughly 30 mev compared to the outcomes when sticking  to  a constant threshold determined by the criterion of stability in the same borel window .",
