    "hawking radiation  spontaneous emission from a system in its ground state  has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "ultimately inspired by hawking s prediction of thermal radiation from a black hole @xcite , the generality of the radiation was first indicated by unruh s analogy between black hole spacetime and the effective spacetime of a moving fluid whose flow velocity crosses the speed of sound @xcite . since then the analogy has been extended to an ever - increasing variety of physical systems @xcite , including water waves @xcite , light in nonlinear media @xcite , and phononic excitations in atomic bec @xcite and in quantum fluids of light @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that these analogue systems , being more accessible than astrophysical black holes , will allow experimental verification of hawking s prediction in a controlled laboratory setting .",
    "understanding wave behaviour in such systems  in particular , the scattering of waves by spatial inhomogeneities in an asymptotically uniform background  is thus of importance for predicting and interpreting experimental observations .",
    "one major difference between the original black - hole spacetime and the background provided by analogue systems is that the latter are typically dominated by dispersion @xcite , which regularizes the phase singularities at horizons but also complicates the wave equations and makes them less amenable to analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "apart from time - consuming fdtd wavepacket simulations @xcite , existing techniques are restricted to situations in which the background is slowly - varying compared with the scale at which dispersion becomes important @xcite , in which case analytical methods are applicable ; or to dispersion relations which are polynomials of low degree @xcite , allowing the numerical solution of the ode in position space provided any exponentially divergent solutions do not severely affect the accuracy of the result .",
    "given that real dispersion relations are often more complicated than this , and that steepening the variation of the background is the surest way of increasing the radiation rate , we would like to have an efficient numerical algorithm which is not so restricted in its scope .    in this paper ,",
    "we describe a method of analyzing the scattering properties of waves in dispersive media by working entirely in fourier space , where the wave equation takes the form of an integral equation .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to the ( not uncommon ) case of a stationary background which is asymptotically the same both to the left and to the right of the scattering region .",
    "( the generalization to backgrounds with different asymptotic values is treated in a sequel paper , referred to here as part ii . )",
    "the required inputs are the dispersion relation and the half - fourier transforms of the background . in fourier space , the dispersion relation is represented by a multiplicative ( rather than differential ) operator , and can thus take an arbitrary form .",
    "steepening of the background corresponds to broadening of its fourier transform .",
    "therefore , so long as it is ensured that the integration range and sampling rate are large enough , the method can accommodate a large variety of possible setups .",
    "we emphasise that , although analogue hawking radiation provides our immediate motivation , the method described in this paper is a general one , applicable to any one - dimensional scattering problem .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : scattering ] , we give a brief overview of the connection between scattering amplitudes and hawking spectra , providing our motivation for the development of the new method .",
    "section [ sec : wave_equation ] describes the wave equation  in particular the acoustic wave equation considered by unruh @xcite  and shows how it becomes an integral equation under fourier transformation . in section [ sec : integral_equation ] , the mathematical theory of the integral method is presented , and an example of its application follows in section [ sec : application ] .",
    "the paper concludes with section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to motivate our treatment of scattering , we give here a brief overview of the connection between scattering and hawking radiation .      assuming a stationary background which becomes homogeneous asymptotically  and rejecting on physical grounds all divergent solutions  a particular solution of a scattering problem",
    "can be represented by the amplitudes of the propagating waves ( those whose frequencies and wavevectors are _ real _ ) far from the scatterer .",
    "in one spatial dimension , there are two natural ways of categorising these far - field propagating waves :    * left and right : waves classified according to their position with respect to the scatterer ; this distinction is mathematically convenient , as each asymptotic plane wave contributes a singular term  whose form is determined by which side of the space it lies on  to the fourier transform of the overall solution ; and * ingoing and outgoing : waves classified according to the direction of their group velocity with respect to the position of the scatterer ; this distinction is physically fundamental , as it is equivalent to separating solutions in the asymptotic past from those in the asymptotic future , localising the waves in time rather than in space .    in the limit of geometrical optics ,",
    "any ingoing or outgoing wave must continuously evolve in time to one of the opposite kind .",
    "thus , the asymptotic plane waves form in / out pairs ; and further , for a linear wave equation , the amplitudes of the ingoing and outgoing waves must be linearly related , so that the number of degrees of freedom is simply the number of in / out pairs . in the case considered in this paper , where the asymptotic values of the background are the same in the left- and right - hand regions , the left- and right - hand sets of wavevector solutions are the same , so that the plane waves can also be thought of as forming left / right pairs with exactly the same frequency and wavevector .",
    "the general solution of a scattering problem can be decomposed into a superposition of ingoing or outgoing modes , which are defined as consisting of a single plane wave in the asymptotic past or future , respectively .",
    "these two sets of modes form bases for the space of solutions , and can be graphically represented using space - time diagrams ( see figure [ fig : in_and_out_modes ] ) . at fixed frequency @xmath1 ,",
    "these modes are stationary , and their ingoing or outgoing nature is best visualised by considering wavepackets formed from a frequency spread highly peaked at @xmath1 ; the stationary modes themselves are the limiting waveform as the frequency spread is narrowed to a @xmath2 function .",
    "scattering solutions are often restricted by conservation laws . in non - relativistic scattering of particles , for instance ,",
    "the total number of particles is conserved , while relativistic scattering is subject to such laws as charge conservation . for waves , there are two conserved quantities :    * the frequency @xmath1 ( whenever the background is stationary ) ; and * a real number called the _",
    "norm_.    conservation of @xmath1 determines which asymptotic plane waves ( labelled by their wavevectors , which form different branches of solutions along which they vary continuously with @xmath1 ) can scatter into each other , while conservation of norm imposes algebraic relations between the squared magnitudes of the scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "if the norms of all plane waves in a given solution have the same sign , its conservation is analogous to non - relativistic scattering and conservation of the number of particles . if , however , some of the plane waves in a given solution have norms of _ opposite _ sign , its conservation is more akin to charge conservation in relativistic scattering : the total amount of wave energy may well change ( in which case a degree of amplification is involved in the scattering process ) , but the energy difference must be distributed equally between positive and negative norm so that the overall change in norm is zero .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "waves are interpreted as operator fields , and those of positive and negative norm are multiplied , respectively , by annihilation and creation operators .",
    "decomposition of out - modes into in - modes can be rearranged to describe decomposition of in - operators into out - operators ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "if scattering occurs in which waves are partially converted into waves with opposite norm , then annihilation operators for in - modes will contain creation operators for out - modes , and vice versa .",
    "given that the quantum vacuum state @xmath3 is defined mathematically as the zero - eigenvalue eigenstate for all annihilation operators : @xmath4 this would mean that the vacuum state for ingoing waves is _ not _ the same as the vacuum state for outgoing waves .",
    "this is the essence of hawking radiation : in the absence of ingoing particles , outgoing particles are present . given that a system is in the in - vacuum , the radiation spectrum of a particular outgoing mode is simply the sum of the squared amplitudes of the opposite - norm ingoing waves occurring in that out - mode .",
    "we can write @xmath5 where the modes @xmath6 are defined so that their norms are @xmath7 , the signs being indicated by the superscripts . the radiation rate per unit frequency of waves on the @xmath8-branch",
    "is then given by @xcite @xmath9 furthermore , norm conservation requires @xcite @xmath10    equations ( [ eq : out - in_decomp ] ) and ( [ eq : hawking_spectrum ] ) show that calculating the spectrum of hawking radiation is equivalent to calculating scattering amplitudes for a particular type of scattering process which mixes waves of opposite norm .",
    "from now on , we will focus our attention on finding the scattering matrix @xmath11 which relates amplitudes of ingoing waves to those of outgoing waves : @xmath12 if the waves to which the amplitudes @xmath13 refer are not themselves normalised , we can define diagonal matrices of normalising prefactors @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the amplitudes of the normalised waves .",
    "these are related via the normalised scattering matrix @xmath17 : @xmath18 the elements of @xmath19 are the @xmath20 and @xmath21 coefficients is a member of the indefinite unitary group @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the number of ingoing ( or outgoing ) wavevector solutions with positive and negative norm . if @xmath25 is the diagonal matrix with @xmath23 @xmath26s and @xmath24 @xmath27s on the diagonal , then @xmath17 obeys @xmath28^{\\star } \\ , \\eta \\,\\mathcal{s}_{n } = \\eta$ ] , and hence @xmath29^{\\star } \\ , \\eta$ ] .",
    "thus the coefficients expressing in - modes as sums of out - modes are very closely related to those expressing out - modes as sums of in - modes . ] of eq .",
    "( [ eq : out - in_decomp ] ) , while those of @xmath17 are the corresponding coefficients with the labels ` in ' and ` out ' of eq .",
    "( [ eq : out - in_decomp ] ) switched .",
    "@xmath17 thus gives the scattering amplitudes for each of the in- and out - modes , determines the hawking spectrum through eq .",
    "( [ eq : hawking_spectrum ] ) and obeys the norm conservation law ( [ eq : norm_conservation ] ) .",
    "it is useful to calculate the full matrix @xmath17 even if we are only concerned with certain elements of it ( in our case , those relating modes of opposite norm ) , as it will allow us to check that norm conservation is indeed respected and thus to test the accuracy of the numerical algorithm .",
    "the method to be presented in section [ sec : integral_equation ] solves an integral equation in fourier space , which is derived by fourier transforming the wave equation in position space . to illustrate the transformation ,",
    "let us perform it in the context of unruh s original fluid model @xcite .",
    "since this model is concerned with the analogy with waves propagating in spacetime , consider the effective spacetime metric @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is assumed constant and @xmath32 is assumed independent of time .",
    "this describes motion in a moving fluid , where @xmath31 is the speed of massless ( sound ) waves , and @xmath32 is the local flow velocity of the fluid .",
    "this results , for massless scalar waves , in the wave equation @xmath33 introducing dispersion destroys the analogy with a spacetime metric , but it can be achieved by making the speed of sound a function of the wavevector @xmath34 @xcite ; or , in position space , @xmath35 becomes a differential operator , and if we also impose the harmonic time dependence @xmath36 , the wave equation becomes : @xmath37 thus we see that , if @xmath38 is a polynomial of finite degree , the dispersive wave equation ( [ eq : dispersive_wave_eqn ] ) becomes ( for each value of @xmath1 ) an ordinary differential equation , and can in principle be solved numerically .",
    "this can not be done if @xmath38 is more complicated than a polynomial , or if the polynomial is of such a high degree that the solution becomes unstable due to the appearance of exponentially divergent solutions .",
    "let us now consider the fourier transformed solution @xmath39 in the wave equation ( [ eq : dispersive_wave_eqn ] ) , spatial derivatives @xmath40 are replaced by the wavevector @xmath34 ; in particular , the differential operator @xmath41 is replaced by the multiplicative operator @xmath38 . in turn ,",
    "multiplicative operators in position space  here these are due to the flow velocity @xmath32  give rise to convolutions in fourier space , since the fourier transform of a product of functions is the convolution of their fourier transforms by @xmath42 , treating @xmath32 as a differential operator in fourier space which can be truncated at a low degree to find approximate solutions ; this is the approach taken when the background is assumed to be slowly - varying in relation to the length scale at which dispersion becomes important , as in @xcite . ] .",
    "the occurrence of further spatial derivatives in the terms containing @xmath32 , plus the multiplication of two factors of @xmath32 , means that the final result is more complicated than a straightforward convolution , though it is still an integral that contains the fourier transforms of the flow velocity , @xmath43(k)$ ] , and of its square , @xmath44(k)$ ] .",
    "the complete fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersive_wave_eqn ] ) is @xmath45 where we have defined @xmath46(k - k^{\\prime } ) + i\\omega\\ , \\mathcal{f}[\\partial_{x}u](k - k^{\\prime } ) \\right .",

    "an analogous procedure can be performed for any linear wave equation : the position - independent part becomes a straightforward multiplicative term , and all the position - dependent terms are absorbed into the kernel of the integral operator , functions of position being replaced by convolution - like integrals .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : wave_equation ] , fourier transforming the wave equation results in an equation whose general form is @xmath47 where for clarity we have suppressed the explicit @xmath1-dependence of eq .",

    "the determinant of this matrix is essentially the product of the values of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , if @xmath56 anywhere in the integration interval , the operator becomes singular .",
    "indeed , this is a necessary condition if we are to have non - trivial , non - unique solutions of a linear homogeneous equation .",
    "since we are considering equal asymptotic values of the background , it can be described by some constant value plus a spatially dependent term which vanishes asymptotically .",
    "the constant value gives rise to a @xmath2 function in the fourier transform of the background , such that the kernel @xmath57 contains a term proportional to @xmath58 .",
