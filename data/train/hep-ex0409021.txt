    "the fermilab accelerator complex has undergone a major upgrade in preparation for tevatron runii .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy has been increased from 1.8  tev to 1.96  tev and the main injector , a new 150  gev proton storage ring , has replaced the main ring as injector of protons and anti - protons into the tevatron .",
    "the initial tevatron luminosity steadily increased throughout runii . by the summer of 2004 ,",
    "the peak luminosity reached is @xmath1  @xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "the total integrated luminosity delivered by the tevatron to cdf and d  by the time of this conference is @xmath4  pb@xmath3 .",
    "more than 300  pb@xmath3 were recorded to tape by each cdf and d .",
    "however , most results shown in this review use about 150 - 250  pb@xmath3 of data . the cdf and d  detectors have also undergone major upgrades for runii which can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the total inelastic @xmath5 cross section at the tevatron is about three orders of magnitude larger than the @xmath6  production cross section .",
    "the cdf and d  trigger system is therefore the most important tool for finding @xmath0  decay products .",
    "physics triggers at cdf and d  are based on leptons including single and dilepton triggers .",
    "identification of dimuon events down to very low momentum is possible , allowing for efficient @xmath7 triggers .",

    "new to the cdf detector is the ability to select events based upon track impact parameter .",
    "the silicon vertex trigger ( svt ) gives cdf access to purely hadronic @xmath0  decays and makes cdf s @xmath0  physics program fully competitive with the one at the @xmath9  @xmath0  factories .",
