    "doppler tomography ( dt ) is a widely - used method in the field of binary systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "it reconstructs an emission - line intensity map in the velocity space ( doppler map ) from the temporal variation of the line profile .",
    "this method is valid in the case that the line forming region co - rotates with the orbital motion .",
    "such a condition is indeed a good approximation for real data of the emission line of the accretion disk in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "a number of studies using dt have revealed characteristic features of accretion disks in cvs : spiral patterns , stream - impact region , and also the emission from the secondary star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dt is an ill - posed inverse problem in most cases .",
    "a filtered back - projection method provides a way to solve the problem .",
    "it masks high frequency components in the doppler maps in order to uniquely determine the solution .",
    "the other way is to introduce regularization terms in addition to the likelihood term .",
    "the maximum entropy method ( mem ) has been used for dt .",
    "the dt with mem determines the solution by maximizing the information entropy over the default image .",
    "one can choose an appropriate default image , for example , axi - symmetric or gaussian blur image .",
    "the comparison between the back - projection method and mem is reported in @xcite .    in general ,",
    "those dt methods tend to smear out localized and sharp - edge profiles in the doppler map because such profiles have high frequency components which make the entropy low . on the other hand , they are expected in accretion physics , such as spiral shocks and hot spots .",
    "it has been reported that there are significant residuals between the observed and model spectra that are obtained from dt ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether the large residuals are caused by the emission components which violate the basic assumption that the emission is isotropic and optically thin .",
    "alternatively , it may be caused by regularization terms which are ill - suited for the real disk .    in this paper , we propose a new dt by total variation minimization ( tvm ) .",
    "tvm has received attention in the field of image reconstruction because it can reconstruct sharp - edge features by making the image sparse in its gradient domain . in section  2 , our model of dt by tvm ( dttvm )",
    "is described . in section  3 ,",
    "several experiments of dttvm are shown for both artificial and real data . in section  4 ,",
    "we shortly discuss the treatment of absorption components in our model , and summarize our findings in section  5 .",
    "dt is a method to reconstruct the doppler map , i.e. , the intensity map in the velocity space @xmath0 . the coordinate system in our model is the same as previous models of dt ( @xcite ) : the radial velocity @xmath1 of a point @xmath0 in the map is represented as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the orbital phase that can be calculated from the observation time and the ephemeris of the binary system .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath4 data given by @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6-th element of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is the flux at a radial velocity @xmath9 and phase @xmath10 .",
    "also suppose @xmath11 points in the doppler map given by @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13-th element in the map has the coordinate of @xmath14 and intensity of @xmath15 .",
    "the radial velocity at @xmath10 and @xmath14 can be calculated from equation  ( 1 ) and represented as @xmath16 .",
    "the goal of dt is to estimate @xmath17 from observations according to @xmath18 the first term in the right side is the least - square term , and the second term is the regularization term which consists of a hyperparameter @xmath19 and a function @xmath20 . in equation  ( 2 ) , @xmath21 is a @xmath22 matrix whose element depends on the phase , radial velocity , and instrumental response .",
    "for the response function , we assumed a gaussian profile with a variance @xmath23 .",
    "an element of @xmath21 , @xmath24 , is then given by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 means a width of the instrument line broadening .",
    "the sampling interval of spectra is usually designed to be smaller than the broadening width in astronomical spectrographs .",
    "hence , @xmath26 corresponds to a spectral resolution in most cases of actual observations .",
    "tvm provides a method to solve ill - posed problems .",
    "the isotropic total variation of the map , @xmath27 , is defined as @xmath28 the anisotropic total variation is @xmath29 @xmath27 is used as @xmath20 in equation  ( 2 ) in this paper .",
    "we confirmed that the model with @xmath30 generates almost the same results as that with @xmath27 .",
    "we use the twist algorithm to estimate @xmath17 in equation  ( 2 ) ( @xcite).http://www.lx.it.pt / bioucas / twist / twist.htm@xmath31 this is a kind of iterative shrinkage / thresholding ( ist ) algorithm , or sometimes called as the proximal gradient method .",
    "ist is an algorithm for minimization problems of a function that is a sum of a differentiable convex function and non - differentiable , but simple - form convex function .",
    "the least - square and tvm terms correspond to those two functions in the present case .",
    "ist solves the problem by a combination of the proximal point method and gradient method : one step consists of a gradient step for the least - square term and a proximal point correction step for the tvm term .",
    "the twist algorithm is a two - step iterative version of ist , enabling a faster convergence than ist . in the present case , the iteration algorithm of twist is , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the proximal operator . for tvm , there is no closed form of @xmath33 , and the iterative method proposed in @xcite is used . in the present case , we used @xmath34 and @xmath35.the intensity @xmath36 in the doppler map can be negative in the present model .",
    "the calculation code of dttvm is available at our web site.http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/uemuram/dttvm/@xmath31 as can be seen in equation  ( 2 ) , the present model assumes that the noise follows a symmetric probability distribution , like a gaussian distribution , and that all observations are yielded with the same variance .",
    "the least - square term in equation  ( 2 ) should be replaced by the least - square term weighted with each observation error if the data quality varies widely .",
    "we make artificial doppler maps , then simulate line - profile variations , and reconstruct the maps from the simulated data .",
    "first , we test dttvm on a case in which the number of the data is larger than the number of pixels of the doppler map . here , the number of the data means the dimension of @xmath7 in equation  ( 2 ) , that is , the number of all data points of the flux in all @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the artificial map contains three spot structures , as shown in the upper left - most panel of figure  [ fig : dopmap_demof ] .",
    "spectra were calculated from this map with a phase interval of 0.01 and a radial velocity interval of @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "no noise was added to the simulated spectra .",
    "we assumed @xmath26 in equation  ( 3 ) to be @xmath40 , which corresponded to @xmath41 in full - width of half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gaussian profile .",
    "as a result , the number of the input data is @xmath42 . using this data , dttvm estimates @xmath43 elements of the doppler map .",
    "figure  [ fig : dopmap_demof ] shows the results .",
    "three different values of the hyperparameter , @xmath19 were used to see the dependence on it .",

    "this behavior can be easily understood because the solution becomes close to that determined by the least - square term in the case of very small @xmath19 in equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "no major difference can be seen in all three estimated doppler maps .",
    "( 170mm,170mm)dopmap_demofmem_paper_s.eps    we also performed mem reconstructions using the same map as figure  1 .",
    "we used two calculation codes : ` doppler ` developed by t. marshhttp://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk / phsaap / software / doppler / html / overview.html@xmath31 and ` dopp ` developed by h. spruit ( @xcite)http://www.mpa - garching.mpg.de/~henk/@xmath31 .",
    "for the mem models , the regularization term , @xmath44 is used , where @xmath45 is the default image . according to @xcite ,",
    "the standard default image is that created from @xmath46 by a gaussian smearing , which is used in ` dopp ` .",
    "we set the same default image also in ` doppler ` .",
    "we confirmed that those two mem codes provided almost consistent results ( except for the data of wz  sge , see subsection  3.2 ) .",

    "<S> we confirmed that dttvm can reproduce the observed spectra with a high precision . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the models based on the maximum entropy method , dttvm provides the doppler maps that little depend on the hyper - parameter and on the presence of the absorption core . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce a cross - validation method to estimate reasonable values of a hyperparameter in the model by the data itself . </S>"
