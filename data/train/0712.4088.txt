    "finally we comment on some possible corrections to the berezin - li - yau inequality and related inequalities .",
    "in this section we show that many universal and geometric bounds for spectra of the dirichlet laplacian , which have been proved in the literature by independent methods , may in fact be derived from one another by the application of the laplace transform and some classical inequalities . in particular , for @xmath83",
    ", it will be shown that the kac inequality ( [ kac - inequality ] ) and the berezin - li - yau inequality ( [ laptev - weidl ] ) are equivalent by the laplace transform .",
    "these inequalities are seen to be corollaries of the riesz - mean inequalities of @xcite @xcite , which in turn can all be derived from the case @xmath57 , originating with yang .    with some minor modifications ,",
    "similar inequalities are then proved for schrdinger spectra .      for the pure laplacian , with no added potential , we start by showing that the kac inequality ( [ kac - inequality ] ) can be derived from the berezin - li - yau inequality ( [ laptev - weidl ] ) as an alternative to kac s `` principle of not feeling the boundary '' .",
    "begin with the observation that the laplace transform yields @xmath84 applying this to ( [ laptev - weidl ] ) immediately leads to @xmath85 which upon simplification reads @xmath86 using the definition of @xmath87 in ( [ classical ] ) results in ( [ kac - inequality ] ) .",
    "indeed it is only necessary to have for a single value of @xmath18 .",
    "we observe that the same argument relates the kac - ray inequality @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , @xmath88 ( also known in the literature as the golden - thompson inequality @xcite ) to the lieb - thirring inequality @xcite @xcite @xmath89 for the laplace transform of yields .",
    "next we show how to obtain kac s inequality directly from yang s inequality and the asymptotic formula .",
    "the link is a result of harrell and stubbe @xcite :    the function @xmath90 is a nonincreasing function .",
    "[ hs - theo ]    in @xcite , this theorem was derived from a trace identity , but here we show that it can alternatively be proved from yang s inequality .",

    "moreover @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "given that the cases @xmath58 of ( [ ha - stu1 ] ) follows from the case @xmath57 , it might be thought that it is not sharp for large @xmath18 .",
    "to the contrary , it was shown in @xcite that ( [ ha - stu1 ] ) implies strict bounds with the correct power corresponding to weyl s law .",
    "indeed :    [ ha - stu - thm2 ] the constant in inequality ( [ ha - stu1 ] ) for @xmath54 can not be improved .    * proof . *",
    "the proof proceeds by contradiction .",
    "suppose there exists a constant @xmath116 such that @xmath117 dividing both sides by @xmath118 , then sending @xmath119 , leads to @xmath120 however , @xmath121 and therefore @xmath122 .",
    "this contradicts the assumption and proves the claim .      at this stage",
    "we make the simple observation that for @xmath83 , the berezin - li - yau inequality ( [ laptev - weidl ] ) follows immediately from inequality ( [ ha - stu2 ] ) ( or ( [ ha - stu1 ] ) ) by virtue of the monotonicity principle of theorem [ mono ] and the asymptotic formula .",
    "in @xcite the difference inequality @xmath124 for @xmath125 was obtained from first principles and used to prove weyl - type universal bounds for ratios of eigenvalues .",
    ". implies a differential inequality and monotonicity principle similar to theorem [ mono ] , but as an alternative we show how to obtain using the `` weighted reverse chebyshev inequality '' ( see , for example , p.  43 of @xcite or @xcite ) :    let @xmath126 and @xmath127 be two real sequences , one of which is nondecreasing and the other nonincreasing , and let @xmath128 be a sequence of nonnegative weights .",

    "we observe that inequality not only implies familiar results for @xmath36 and @xmath43 ( the hile - protter inequality @xcite ) , but also hitherto unexplored inequalities for @xmath138 .",
    "we showed earlier how to obtain kac s inequality from . in this section ,",
    "we show the reverse , and thus the full equivalence of the two statements . throughout this section",
    "we assume @xmath83 .    as a result of the monotonicity theorem [ mono ] , for @xmath139 , @xmath140 with @xmath141 , @xmath142 the laplace transform of a shifted function",
