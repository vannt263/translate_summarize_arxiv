    "econophysics is a science in its infancy , born about ten years ago at this time of writing , at the crossing roads of physics , mathematics , computing and of course economics and finance .",
    "it also covers human sciences , because all economics is ultimately driven by human decision . from this human factor ,",
    "econophysics has no hope to achieve the status of an exact science , but it is interesting to discover what can be achieved , discovering potential limits and trying try to push further away these limits .",
    "numerous works have inspired physicists and guided them towards the studies of financial markets .",
    "we could start with bachelier @xcite who introduced what shall perhaps remain the simplest and most successful model for price variations but for the moment , it suffices to mention that it relies on gaussian statistics .",
    "however , bachelier could have learned from pareto @xcite that power - laws are ubiquitous in nature .",
    "in fact , large price variations in high frequency seems to be described by a crossover between two power - laws , time correlations in the variance is also decay as a power - law and so do numerous other quantities related to finance .",
    "mandelbrot @xcite and fama @xcite helped move forward from these empirical evidences by proposing to describe price variations using a class of distributions studied by lvy @xcite .",
    "thereafter , these distributions were abruptly truncated by mantegna and stanley @xcite and exponentially truncated by koponen @xcite to recover a slow convergence towards a gaussian distribution for low frequency data , as observed empirically .    from the previous collection of dates , going as far as 1897 for pareto , one concludes that the field of research is not new , but the interest has been renewed recently as testified by the recent excellent works on econophysics , starting with a conference book published by anderson , arrow and pines @xcite followed by the books of bouchaud and potters @xcite and mantegna and stanley @xcite paul and baschnagel @xcite and voit @xcite these works show the variety of interests and successes of the approach of finance by physicists . from these works and the many research papers , we gather that there exists a temporary consensus on empirical data , though there is no such unity in modeling .",
    "there is a profusion of models indeed .",
    "first recall that a `` price '' can only go up or down , that is , is a one - dimensional quantity .",
    "therefore , it can be seen as a point diffusing on a line .",
    "the factors driving this diffusive process are numerous , and their nature is still not fully elucidated .",
    "hence , one can only make plausible assumptions and test afterwards their value by comparing the distribution of changes generated by the diffusion process with actual price evolution changes , price being also understood as the value of some financial index or some exchange rate between currencies .",
    "a fundamental problem is the existence or not of long - range power - law correlations in economic systems as well as the presence of economic cycles . indeed ,",
    "traditional methods ( like spectral methods ) have corroborated that there is evidence that the brownian motion idea is only approximately right @xcite .",
    "long - range power - law correlations discovered in economic systems , particularily in financial fluctuations @xcite have been examined through the so - called lvy statistics already mentioned by stanley et al .",
    "@xcite who have shown the existence of long - range power - law correlations in the standard and poor ( s&p500 ) index . a method based on wavelet analysis",
    "has also shown the emergence of hidden structures in the s&p500 index @xcite .",
    "we have first performed a detrended fluctuation analysis ( @xmath0 ) of the @xmath2 ratio @xcite and of other foreign currency exchanges and have demonstrated the existence of successive sequences of economic activity having different statistical behaviors .",
    "they will be mentioned in the relevant section .",
    "a word of caution is at once necessary : this review is by no means objective .",
    "it is strongly biased towards studies undergone by a few physicists in the last few years , in order to give an overview of a few results in the physics literature on only two topics : foreign currency exchanges and stock market indices .",
    "even so , it is not possible to cover all papers published or put on arxives .",
    "i do apologize for having missed many papers and ideas .",
    "of course , since no full review of the different developments belonging to the physics literature is here possible , the more so about the purely economics literature .",
    "however on one hand , each of the research papers presented here has individually justified its sideline propositions which would be tiring to reproduce . on the other hand",
    ", there is a huge amount of overlaps between the different works summarized here below and models developed by many authors . trying to distinguish the main contributions",
    "separately is a titan work .",
    "attempting to compare and discuss details is quasi impossible .",
    "yet this review of econophysics and data analysis techniques , restricted to stock markets and foreign exchange currency markets should only seen as to open a gate toward huge undiscovered fields .    in the following section a few data analysis techniques",
    "will be described with emphasis on the detrended fluctuation analysis ( @xmath0 ) and the zipf analysis technique ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "information about the original data will be sketchy , but the data concerns mainly the foreign currency exchange market .",
    "the robustness of the @xmath0 technique will be underlined and additional remarks will be given for suggesting further work . in the next section models about financial index value evolutions will be recalled , again without going into elaborate work discussing typical agent behaviors , but rather with hopefully sufficient information such that the basic ingredients can be memorized before reading some of the vast literature on price formation .",
    "crashes being spectacular phenomena must retain our attention and do through data analysis and basic intuitive models .",
    "a few `` more general '' microscopic models will also be outlined .",
    "in the basic detrended fluctuation analysis ( @xmath0 ) technique one divides a time series @xmath3 of length @xmath4 into @xmath5 equal size nonoverlapping boxes @xcite . for smoothing out the data , the integration of the raw time series",
    "can often be performed first ; in so doing one has to remember that such an integration shifts the exponent by one unit . the variable @xmath6 is discrete , evolves by a single unit at each time step between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "no data point is supposed to be missing , i.e. , breaks due to holidays and week - ends are disregarded .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath9 units are said to be @xmath10 : often a week has only 5 days , and a year about 200 days .",
    "let each box contain @xmath9 points and @xmath5 be an integer .",
    "the local trend in each @xmath9-size box is assumed to be linear , i.e. it is taken as @xmath11 = @xmath12 @xmath6 + @xmath13 . in each @xmath9-size box",
    "one next calculates the root mean square deviation between @xmath3 and @xmath14 .",
    "the detrended fluctuation function @xmath15 is then calculated following @xmath16    averaging @xmath17 over all @xmath5 box sizes centered on time @xmath9 gives the fluctuations @xmath18 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the calculation is repeated for all possible different values of @xmath9 .",
    "a power law behavior is expected as @xmath19 an exponent @xmath20 in a certain range of @xmath9 values implies the existence of long - range correlations in that time interval as in the fractional brownian motion @xcite .",
    "such correlations are said to be `` persistent '' or `` antipersistent '' when they correspond to @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively in practice @xmath23 = @xmath24 .",
    "a straight line can well fit the data between @xmath25 = 1 and @xmath25 = 2.6 .",
    "this interval is called the @xmath26 . outside the scaling range",
    "the error bars are larger often because of so called finite size effects , and/or the lack of numerous data points .",
    "the @xmath24 exponent is directly related to the hurst exponent @xcite and the signal fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "most of the time , for the real or virtual foreign exchange currency ( @xmath27 ) rates that we have examined @xcite , the scaling range is well defined .",
    "sometimes it readily appears that the data contains two sets of points which can be fitted by straight lines .",
    "usually that describing the `` large @xmath9 '' data has a @xmath28 slope , indicating correlationless fluctuations .",
    "crossovers from fractional to ordinary brownian motion can be well observed .",
    "these crossovers suggest that correlated sequences have characteristic durations with well defined lower and upper scales @xcite .",
    "the persistence is usually related to free market ( and `` runaway '' ) conditions while the antipersistence develops due to strict political control allowing for a finite size bracket in which the @xmath27 rates can fluctuate .",
    "the case @xmath29 is surely avoided by speculators .",
    "notice that to consider overlapping boxes might be useful when not many data points are available .",
    "however it was feared that extra insidious correlations would thereby be inserted .",
    "nevertheless the analysis has shown that the value of @xmath24 is rather insensitive to the way boxes are used . a cubic trend , like @xmath30 ,",
    "can be also considered @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 to @xmath31 are similarly estimated through a best least - square fit of the data points in each box . following the procedure described here above the value of the exponent @xmath24",
    "can be obtained .",
    "again the difference is found to be very small .",
    "extensions of @xmath0 to higher moment components have also been investigated , tending toward some sort of multifractal analysis .",
    "moreover the linear or cubic or other polynomial law fitting the trend can be usefully replaced by some moving average , leading to some further insight into the hurst exponent value.@xcite    an interesting observation consists at looking for _ local _ ( more exactly _ temporal _ ) @xmath24 values @xcite .",
    "this allows one to probe the existence or not of _ locally correlated or decorrelated sequences_. in order to observe the local correlations , a local observation box of a given finite size is constructed .",
    "its size depends on the upper value of @xmath9 for which a reasonable power law exponent is found .",
    "it is chosen to be large enough in order to obtain a sufficiently large number of data points .",
    "the @xmath32 exponent @xmath24 is then calculated for the data contained in that finite size box , as above .",
    "thereafter the box is moved along the time axis by an arbitrary finite number of points , often depending on the intended strategy .",
    "the @xmath33 seems rougher , and varies with time around the overall ( mean ) @xmath24 value .",
    "the variation depends on the box size .",
    "three typical @xmath27 rate time dependences , i.e. @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 have been shown for various time intervals in @xcite and the @xmath24 value indicated for the scaling range .",
    "for example , the @xmath34 @xmath37 is consistently above @xmath28 indicating a persistent evolution .",
    "a positive fluctuation is likely to be followed by another positive one .",
    "the case of @xmath35 is typically brownian with fluctuations around @xmath28 .",
    "however , in 1994 some drift is observed toward a value @xmath38 @xmath39 while in 1997 - 1998 some drift is observed toward a value @xmath38 @xmath40 .",
    "it is clear that some economic policy change occurred in 1994 , and a drastic one at the end of 1998 in order to render the system more brownianlike .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath36 where due to european economic policy the spread in this exchange rate was changed several times , leading from a brownianlike situation to a nowadays antipersistent behavior , i.e. a positive fluctuation is followed by a negative one , and conversely , such that @xmath37 is becoming pretty low .",
    "therefore this procedure interestingly leads to a @xmath32 measurement of the degree of long - range correlations .",
    "in other investigations , @xcite it has been found on the @xmath41 exchange rate data that the change in slope of @xmath37 @xmath42 time corresponds to changes in the bundesbank interest rate increase or decrease .",
    "the 1985 plaza agreement had some influence in order to curb the run away @xmath37 value from a persistent @xmath43 back to a more @xmath28 brownian - like value .",
    "thus such @xmath27 rate behaviors indicate a measure of information , an entropy variation indicating how ( whatever )  information is managed by the system .",
    "this seems to be an `` information '' to be taken into account when developing hamiltonian or thermodynamic - like models .    at some",
    "time,@xcite it was also searched for correlations and anticorrelations in exchange rates of pre - euro moneys with respect to currencies as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 in order to understand the @xmath48 behavior .",
    "the power law behavior describing the rms .",
    "deviation of the fluctuations as a function of time , whence the hurst ( or @xmath24 ) time - dependent exponent was obtained .",
    "we compared the time dependent @xmath24 exponent of the @xmath0 as in a correlation matrix for estimating respective influences . in doing a similar analysis ,",
    "it was shown that the fluctuations of the @xmath49 and @xmath48 with respect to the major currencies were very similar , indirectly indicating that the @xmath49 was effectively tied to @xmath48 .",
    "same for studies pertaining to latin american currencies @xcite .    since",
    "such temporal correlations can be sorted out , a strategy for profit making can be developed .",
    "it is easily observed whether there is persistence or antipersistence in some exchange rate , - according to the temporal value of @xmath24 .",
    "thus some probability on the next fluctuation , to be positive or negative can be made .",
    "therefore a buy or sell decision can be taken . in so doing and taking the example of ( @xmath50 ) , we performed some virtual game and implemented the most simple strategy @xcite .",
    "investment strategies should look for @xmath23 values over different time interval windows which are continuously shifted . in this respect connection to multifractal analysis .",
    "the technique consists in calculating the so - called `` @xmath51th order height - height correlation function '' @xmath52 where only non - zero terms are considered in the average @xmath53 taken over all couples @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "the correlation function _",
    "c(@xmath9 ) _ is supposed to behave like @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath23 exponent .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to obtaining a spectrum of moving averages indeed   @xcite . notice that a @xmath0 and a multifractal analysis cost much more cpu time than a moving average method due to multiple loops which are present in the @xmath0 and @xmath58 algorithms @xcite .    of course , subtracting some moving average background , instead of the usual linear trend , is of interest in order to implement a strategy based on different horizons .",
    "the same type of consideration for a strategy can be developed from the zipf analysis technique ( @xmath1 ) performed on stock market or @xmath27 data . in the ( @xmath0 ) technique",
    "the sign of the fluctuations and their persistence , are taken into account , but it falls short of implementing some strategy from the _ amplitude _ of the fluctuations . the so - called zipf analysis @xcite originally introduced in the context of natural languages can be performed by calculating the frequency of occurence @xmath31 of each word in a given text . according to their frequency",
    ", a rank @xmath59 can be assigned to each word , with @xmath60 for the most frequent one .",
    "a power law @xmath61 is expected @xcite .",
    "a zipf plot is simply a transformation of the cumulative distribution .",
    "however , it accentuates the upper tail of the distribution , which makes it a useful to analyze this part of the distribution .",
    "a simple extension of the zipf analysis is to consider @xmath62-letter words , i.e. the words strictly made of @xmath62 characters without considering the white spaces",
    ". the available number of different letters or characters @xmath63 in the alphabet should also be specified . a power law in @xmath64",
    "is expected as well for correlated sequences @xcite .",
    "there is no theory at this time predicting the exponent as a function of ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the technique has a rather weak value when only two characters and short words are considered @xcite .",
    "an increase in the number of allowed characters for the alphabet allows one to consider different size and signs of the fluctuations , i.e. huge , marginal and small ( positive or negative ) fluctuations can be considered .",
    "after having decided on the number ( @xmath63 ) of characters of the alphabet , the signal can be transformed into a text and thereafter analysed with respect to the frequency of words of a given size ( @xmath62 ) to be ranked accordingly . in our work ,",
    "words of equal lengths were always considered    the above procedure does not take into account the trend .",
    "some work has been done on the matter , but much is still to be performed since the trend definition can be quite different for later strategy considerations .",
    "the relevance of this remark should be emphasized : indeed for a positive ( or negative ) trend over the time box which is investigated , a bias can occur between words .",
    "for a two character alphabet , e.g. @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the frequency @xmath31 of @xmath66 s , i.e. @xmath68 can be larger ( smaller ) than the frequency of @xmath67 s , i.e. @xmath69 . such a @xmath70 can be taken into account with respect to the equal probability occurrence , e.g. @xmath71 = @xmath72 = @xmath73 .",
    "a new ranking procedure can be performed by defining the ratio of the observed frequency of a word divided by the theoretical frequency of occurrence of a word , assuming independence of characters .",
    "e.g. if the word @xmath74 occurs say @xmath75 times , since the independence of characters would imply that the word would occur @xmath76 times , a relative frequency @xmath77 can be defined as @xmath78 .",
    "a new ranking can be made with quite different appearance .",
    "a @xmath1 variant consists in ranking the words according to their relative frequency and relative ( `` normalized '' ) rank taking into account for the normalization the probability @xmath79 of the most often occurring word @xcite .",
    "indeed for @xmath62 and @xmath63 large not all words do occur . even though , e.g. for the ( @xmath80 ) case there are 64 possible words , and the maximum rank is @xmath81 = 64 , the frequency of the most often observed word is unknown .",
    "another extension has been recently proposed in which time windows are used in order to sort better the relevant exponents and probability of occurrence @xcite .    in conclusion of this subsection",
    ", it is emphasized that different strategies following the zipf analysis technique can be implemented , according to @xmath82 values , how the trend is eliminated ( or not ) and how the ranks and frequencies of occurrence are defined .",
    "quite simultaneously , laloux _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and plerou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the correlations between stocks traded on financial markets using the theory of random matrices .",
    "considered daily price changes for the 1991 - 1996 period ( 1309 day ) of 406 of the companies forming the s&p500 index while plerou _",
    "analyzed price returns over a 30 minute period of the 1,000 largest us companies for the 1994 - 1995 period ( 6448 points for each company ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient between two stocks @xmath83 and @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the price of company @xmath83 for laloux _ et al . _ and",
    "the return of the price for plerou _",
    "et al_. the statistical average is a temporal average performed on all trading days of the investigated periods .",
    "the cross - correlation matrix @xmath87 of elements @xmath88 is measured at equal times .",
    "laloux _ et al _ @xcite focussed on the density @xmath89 of eigenvalues of @xmath87 , defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of eigenvalues of @xmath87 less than @xmath92 and @xmath4 the number of companies ( or equivalently the dimension of @xmath87 ) .",
    "the empirically determined @xmath89 is compared with the eigenvalue density of a random matrix , that is , a matrix whose components are random variables .",
    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) isolates universal features , which means that deviations from these features identifies system - specific properties .",
    "_ found that 94% of the total number of eigenvalues fall inside the prediction of rmt , which means that it is very difficult to distinguish correlations from random changes in financial markets .",
    "the most striking difference is that rmt predicts a maximum value for the largest eigenvalue which is much smaller than what is observed empirically . in particular , a very large eigenvalue is measured , representing the market itself .",
    "@xcite observed similar properties in their empirical study .",
    "they measured the number of companies contributing to each eigenvector and found that a small number of companies ( compared to 1,000 ) contribute to the eigenvectors associated to the largest and the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "for the largest eigenvalues these companies are correlated , while for the smallest eigenvalues , these are uncorrelated .",
    "the observation for the largest eigenvalues does not concern the largest one , which has an associated eigenvector representing the market and has an approximately equal contribution from each stock .",
    "mantegna @xcite analyzed the correlations between the 30 stocks used to calculate the dow jones industrial average and the correlations between the companies used to calculate the s&p500 index , for the july 1989 to october 1995 time period in both cases .",
    "only the companies which were present in the s&p500 index during the whole period time were considered , which leaves 443 stocks .",
    "the correlation coefficient of the returns for all possible pairs of stocks was computed . a metric distance between two stocks",
    "is defined by @xmath93 .",
    "these distances are the elements of the distance matrix @xmath94 .    using the distance matrix @xmath94 , mantegna determined the topological arrangement which is present between the different stock",
    ". his study could also give empirical evidence about the existence and nature of common economic factors which drive the time evolution of stock prices , a problem of major interest .",
    "mantegna determined the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) connecting the different indices , and thereafter , the subdominant ultrametric structure and heriarchical organization of the indices .",
    "in fact , the elements @xmath95 of the ultrametric distance matrix @xmath96 are determined from the mst .",
    "@xmath95 is the maximum euclidian distance @xmath97 detected by moving by single steps from @xmath83 to @xmath84 through the path connecting @xmath83 to @xmath84 in the mst .",
    "studying the mst and hierarchical organization of the stocks defining the dow jones industrial average , mantegna showed that the stocks can be divided in three groups .",
    "carrying the same analysis for the stocks belonging to the s&p500 , mantegna obtained a grouping of the stocks according to the industry they belong to .",
    "this suggests that stocks belonging to the same industry respond in a statistical way to the same economic factors .",
    "later , bonanno _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended the previous analysis to consider correlations between different ( 29 stock market indices , one from africa , eight from america , nine from asia , one from oceania and ten from europe .",
    "their correlation coefficients @xmath88 was calculated using the return of the indices instead of the individual stocks .",
    "they also modified slightly the definition of the distance , using @xmath98",
    ". a hierarchical structure of indices was obtained , showing a distinct regional clustering .",
    "clusters for north - america , south america and europe emerge , while asian indices are more diversified .",
    "japanese and indian stock markets are pretty distant from the others .",
    "when the same analysis is performed over different periods of time , the clustering is still present , with a slowly evolving stucture of the ultrametric distance with time .",
    "the taxinomy is stable over a long period of time .",
    "two key parameters are the length @xmath99 and the proximity @xmath100 .",
    "the length is @xmath101 , where the sum runs over nearest neighbouring sites on the mst .",
    "it is a kind of average of first - neighbour distances over the whole mst .",
    "the proximity is @xmath102 where the sums run over all distinct @xmath103 pairs .",
    "the proximity characterizes the degree of resemblance of the subdominant ultrametric space to the euclidian space . for long time period , @xmath104 , while @xmath105 for sequences without correlations .",
    "similarly , for long time period , @xmath106 , to compare with @xmath107 when the same data are shuffled to destroy any correlations .",
    "the effects of spurious cross - correlations make the previous time analysis relevant for time periods of the order of three months or longer for daily data .    others @xcite analyzed the sign of daily changes of the nikkei , the dax and the dow jones industrial average for the dow jones only and for the three time series together , reproducing the evolution of the market through the sign of the fluctuation , as if the latter was represented by an ising spin .",
    "the authors studied the frequency of occurrence of triplets of spins for the january 1980 to december 1990 period , after having removed the bias due to a different probability of having a move upward or downward .",
    "they showed that the spin series generated by each index separately is comparable to a randomly generated series .",
    "however , they emphasized correlations in the spin series generated by the three indices showing that market places fluctuate in a cooperative fashion .",
    "three upward moves in a row are more likely than expected from a series without correlations between successive changes , and similarly for three downward moves .",
    "this behaviour seems to be symmetrical with respect to ups and downs in the time period investigated .",
    "the strength of the correlations varies with time , with the difference in frequency of different patterns being neatly marked in the two year period preceding the 1987 crash .",
    "also , during this period , the up - down symmetry is broken .",
    "finally let us mention the recurrence plot ( @xmath108 ) and recurrence quantification analysis ( @xmath109 ) techniques for detecting e.g. critical regimes appearing in financial market indices @xcite . those are graphical tools elaborated by eckmann , kamphorst and ruelle in 1987 , based on phase space reconstruction @xcite and extended by zbilut and webber @xcite in 1992 @xmath108 and @xmath109 techniques are usually intended to provide evidence for chaos , but can also be used for their goodness in working with non stationarity and noisy data @xcite and in detecting changes in data behavior , in particular in detecting breaks , like a phase transition @xcite , and other dynamic properties of a time series @xcite .",
    "it was indicated that they can be used for detecting bubble nucleation , grow and even indicate bursting .",
    "an analysis was made on two time series , nasdaq and dax , taken over a time span of 6 years including the known ( nasdaq ) crash of april 2000 .",
    "it has been shown that a bubble burst warning could be given , with some delay ( @xmath110 days ) with respect to the beginning of the bubble , but with enough time before the crash ( 3 months in the mentioned cases ) @xcite .",
    "a few functions used to fit empirical data should be mentioned .",
    "the point is to try to determine which laws are the best approximation for which data .",
    "some of these laws rely on plausible and fairly convincing arguments a major step forward to quantify the discrepancies between real time series and gaussian statistics was made by mandelbrot @xcite who studied cotton prices .",
    "in addition to being non - gaussian , mandelbrot noted that returns respect time scaling , that is , the distribution of returns for various time scales @xmath111 from 1 day up to one month have similar functional form .",
    "motivated by this scaling and the fact that large events are far more probable than expected , he proposed that the statistics of returns could be described by symmetrical lvy distributions ; other laws can appear to better fit the data , and also rely on practical arguments , yet they appear as _ ad hoc _ modifications , like the truncated lvy flight .",
    "the acronym ` arch ' stands for autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity , a process introduced by engle @xcite . in short",
    ", engle assumed that the price at a given time is drawn from a probability distribution which depends on information about previous prices , what he referred to as a conditional probability distribution ( cpd ) . typically , in a arch(@xmath112 )",
    "process , the variance of the cpd @xmath113 at time @xmath6 is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , ... are random variables chosen from sets of random variables with gaussian distributions of zero mean and standard deviations @xmath117 , @xmath118 , ... , respectively .",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath120 , ... , @xmath121 are control parameters . locally ( in time ) , @xmath122 varies but on long time scale , the overal process is stationary for a wide range of values of the control parameters .",
    "bollerslev @xcite generalized the previous process by introducing generalized arch or garch(@xmath112,@xmath51 ) processes .",
    "he suggested to model the time evolution of the variance of the cpd @xmath123 at time @xmath6 with @xmath124 with an added set @xmath125 of @xmath51 control parameters on top of already @xmath112 control parameters . using this process",
    ", it is now possible to generate time correlations in the variance .",
    "the previous processes have been extended , as in egarch processes @xcite , igarch processes @xcite , figarch processes @xcite , among others .",
    "mantegna and stanley @xcite analyzed the returns of the s&p500 index from jan .",
    "1984 to dec . 1989 .",

    "113pt|c|c|    * property * & * agreement * + fat tails & qualitative + crossover & no + symmetric & yes + clustering & no + crashes & yes + precursors & no +    eguilz and zimmermann @xcite introduced a dynamical version of the cont - bouchaud model . at each time step ,",
    "an agent is selected at random . with probability @xmath223 , she selects another agent and a link between those two agents is created .",
    "otherwise , this agent triggers her cluster to make a transaction , buying with probability @xmath12 , selling with probability @xmath12 .",
    "eguilz and zimmermann associated the creation of a link with the exchange of information between agents , while when the agents make a transaction , they make their information public , that is , this information is lost .",
    "dhulst and rodgers @xcite have shown that this model is equivalent to the cont - bouchaud model , except that with the new interpretation , the probability that a cluster of size @xmath246 makes transaction is @xmath247 rather than @xmath248 as in the cont - bouchaud model .",
    "extension of the model allowing for the cluster distribution not to change can be envisaged .",
    "finally , we should mention that numerical simulations show that it is possible to observe power - laws with higher than expected effective exponent .",
    "in other words , size effects can modify the exponent . as all empirical data are strongly affected by size effects , looking after a model that reproduces the exact value of the exponent seems less important than trying to justify why the exponent should have a given value .      in the cont - bouchaud model for @xmath249",
    ", there is a non - zero probability that a finite fraction of agents decide to buy or sell .",
    "these large cooperative events generate anomalous wings in the tails of the distribution , that is , it appears as outliers of the distribution .",
    "the same pattern has been observed by johansen and sornette for crashes on financial markets , which means that the decision from buying or selling of the percolating cluster can be compared to a crash .",
    "these crashes however lack any precursor patterns , which have been empirically observed for real crashes , as originally proposed by sornette , johansen and bouchaud .    as explained by stauffer and sornette @xcite log - periodic oscillations , a crash precursor signature ,",
    "can be produced with biased diffusion .",
    "the sites of a large lattice are randomly initialised as being accessible with probability @xmath112 , or forbidden , with probability @xmath250 .",
    "a random - walker diffuses on the accessible sites only . with probability @xmath251 ,",
    "the random - walk moves in one fixed direction , while with probability @xmath252 , it moves to one randomly selected nearest neighbour . in both cases ,",
    "the move is allowed only if the neighbour is accessible . writing the time variation of the mean - square displacement from a starting point as @xmath253 ,",
    "@xmath63 changes smoothly as a function of the logarithm of the time .",
    "that is , @xmath254 approaches unity while oscillating according to @xmath255 . behind these log - periodic oscillations",
    "is the fact that the random - walker gets trapped in clusters of forbidden sites .",
    "the trapping time depends exponentially on the length of the traps , that are multiple of the lattice mesh size .",
    "the resulting intermittent random - walk is thus punctuated by the successive encounters of larger and larger clusters of trapping sites .",
    "this result is much more effective in reduced dimensionality , or equivalently when @xmath256 .",
    "we have to stress that , even if this model is very closely related to percolation , there exists no explanation on how to relate the distance traveled by a diffusing particle to transactions on financial markets .",
    "connection to the sandpile model is still to be worked out .",
    "hence , this model is not an extension of the cont - bouchaud model of financial markets , but rather a hint of a possible direction for on how implement log - periodic oscillations .",
    "notice that within the framework of the langevin equation proposed by bouchaud and cont @xcite , a crash occurs after an improbable succession of unfavorable events , because they are initiated by the noise term .",
    "hence , no precursor pattern can be identified within the original equation .",
    "bouchaud and cont extended their model and proposed the following mechanism to explain log - periodic oscillations . every time an anomalously negative value @xmath66 close to @xmath257 is reached",
    ", the market becomes more ` nervous ' .",
    "this is similar to saying that the width @xmath258 of the distribution describing the noise term @xmath259 increases to @xmath260 .",
    "therefore , the time @xmath111 between the next anomalously large negative value will be shorten as large fluctuations become more likely .",
    "the model predicts    @xmath261    where , to linear order in @xmath262 , @xmath263 is some constant .",
    "this leads to a roughly log - periodic behaviour , with the time difference between two events being a geometric series .",
    "the previous scenario predicts that a crash is not related to a critical point .",
    "that is , there is a crash because @xmath66 reaches @xmath257 , not because @xmath264 .",
    "lux and marchesi @xcite have introduced a model of financial market where the agents are divided in two groups , fundamentalists and noise traders .",
    "fundamentalists expect the price to follow the so - called fundamental value of the asset ( @xmath265 ) , which is the discounted sum of expected future earnings ( for example , dividend payments ) .",
    "a fundamentalist strategy is to buy ( sell ) when the actual price is believed to be below ( above ) @xmath265 .",
    "the noise traders attempt to identify price trends and patterns and also consider the behaviour of other traders as a source of information .",
    "the noise traders are also considered as optimistic or pessimistic .",
    "the former tends to buy because they thing the market will be raising , while the latter bet on a decreasing market and rush out of the market to avoid losses .",
    "the dynamics of the model are based on the movements of agents from one group to the other .",
    "a switch from one group to the other happens with a certain exponential probability @xmath266 , varying with time .",
    "@xmath267 is a parameter for the frequency of revaluation of opinions or strategies by the agents .",
    "@xmath268 is a forcing term covering the factors that are relevant for a change of behaviour , and it depends on the type of agent considered .",
    "noise traders use the price trend in the last time steps and the difference between the number of optimistic and pessimistic traders to calculate @xmath268 corresponding to transitions between the group of optimists and pessimists .",
    "for example , observation of a positive trend and more optimists than pessimists is an indication of a continuation of the rising market .",
    "this would induce some pessimistic agents to become optimistic .",
    "the other type of transitions is between fundamentalists and noise traders .",
    "the @xmath268 function corresponding to such transitions is a function of the difference in profits made by agents in each group .",
    "an optimistic trader profit consists in short - term capital gain ( loss ) due to price increase ( decrease ) , while a pessimistic trader gain is given by the difference between the average profit rate of alternative investments ( assumed to be constant ) minus the price change of the asset they sell .",
    "a fundamentalist profit is made off the difference between the fundamental price and the actual price , that is , @xmath269 is associated to an arbitrage opportunity . in practice , lux and marchesi ( 1999 )",
    "multiply this arbitrage profit by a factor @xmath270 to take into account the time it takes some time for the actual price to reverse to its fundamental value .    to complete the model , it remains to specify how the price and its fundamental value are updated .",
    "price changes are assumed to be proportional to the aggregate excess demand .",
    "optimistic noise traders are buying , pessimistic noise traders are selling and fundamentalists are all buying or all selling depending if @xmath271 is positive or negative , respectively . finally",
    ", relative changes in the fundamental price are gaussian random variable , @xmath272 , where @xmath273 is a normally distributed random variable , with mean zero and time - invariant variance @xmath274 .",
    "lux and marchesi claimed that a theoretical analysis of their model shows that the stationary states of the dynamics are characterized by a price which is on average equal to its fundamental value .",
    "this is supported by numerical simulations of the model , where it can be seen that the price tracks the variation of its fundamental value . but comparing price returns , by construction , the fundamental returns are gaussian , while price returns are not .",
    "the distribution of price returns display fat tails that can be characterized by a power - law of exponent @xmath275 .",
    "numerically , lux and marchesi obtained @xmath276 when sampling at every time step . increasing the time lag , a convergence towards a gaussian",
    "is observed .",
    "they measured a hurst exponent @xmath277 for the price returns , showing strong persistence in the volatility .",
    "the exact value of the exponent is close to empirical data .",
    "the behaviour of the model comes from an alternation between quiet and turbulent periods .",
    "the switch between the different types of periods are generated by the movements of the agents .",
    "turbulent periods are characterized by a large number of noise traders .",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath278 for the number of traders , such as when there are more than @xmath278 traders , the system looses stability .",
    "however , the ensuing destabilization is only temporary as the presence of fundamentalists and the possibility to become a fundamentalist ensure that the market always stabilizes again .",
    "these temporary destabilizations are known as on - off intermittency in physics .",
    "there are necessarily crash and financial market aspects which resemble phase transitions ; this has led into producing a realm of spin models . the superspin model proposed by chowdhury and stauffer @xcite is related to the cont - bouchaud model presented here above .",
    "the cluster of connected agents are replaced by a superspin of size @xmath263 .",
    "@xmath279 is the number of agents associated with the superspin @xmath83 .",
    "the value of @xmath279 is chosen initially from a probability distribution @xmath280 .",
    "a superspin can be in three different states , @xmath281 , 0 or @xmath282 .",
    "associated to each state is a ` disagreement function ' @xmath283 , where @xmath284 is a local field and @xmath285 an individual bias .",
    "@xmath286 represents the disagreement between the actual value of a superspin and two other factors .",
    "one of these factors , @xmath287 , is an average over the decision of the other groups of agents .",
    "the other factor , @xmath285 , is a personal bias in the character of a group of agents , with groups of optimists for @xmath288 , and pessimists for @xmath289 .",
    "groups with @xmath290 are pure noise traders . at each time step",
    ", every superspin @xmath83 chooses one of its three possible states , @xmath281 with probability @xmath12 ( buying ) , @xmath282 with probability @xmath12 or 0 with probability @xmath223 ( doing nothing ) .",
    "a superspin is allowed to change from its present state to the new chosen state with probability @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is the expected change in its disagreement function .",
    "@xmath293 corresponds to the aggregate excess demand , @xmath94 .",
    "if a linear relation @xmath245 is assumed between the returns and @xmath94 , the previous model is characterized by a probability distribution for the prices with power - law tails with the same exponent @xmath294 , as the distribution of spins .",
    "in contrast to the cont - bouchaud model , this result stays true for all values of @xmath12 , that is , there is no convergence towards a gaussian for any value of @xmath12 , contrary to what is observed on financial markets . using @xmath285 ,",
    "it is possible to divide the population in noise traders for @xmath295 and fundamentalists for @xmath296 .",
    "it is also possible to introduce a dynamics in @xmath285 to reflect the different opinions in different states of the market .",
    "no complete study of these properties has been done to date .",
