    "several witnesses and measures have been proposed in order to characterize the non - markovianity of quantum processes @xcite .",
    "for instance , the information flow between system and environment , quantified by the distinguishability of any two quantum states @xcite , or by the fisher information @xcite , or mutual information @xcite ; the loschmidt echo @xcite ; the entanglement between system and environment @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the divisibility criterion @xcite , which consists in checking the non - positivity of intermediate time quatum maps .",
    "the system we will consider is formed by qubits governed by general fermionic quadratic hamiltonians . performing an exact diagonalization of the system - environment hamiltonian @xcite , we will obtain , analytically , the kraus representation of the quantum map @xcite .",
    "then we will propose a non - markovianity measure , and will investigate in detail a model governed by the ising hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly revise the formalism of dynamical maps and the divisibility criterion in sec.ii .",
    "our first result appears in sec.iii , where we present the exact kraus decomposition for general quadratic fermionic hamiltonians , and introduce a witness of non - markovianity . in sec.iv",

    "our results for the dynamics of a qubit interacting with an environment governed by the ising model are presented in sec.vi , and then we conclude .",
    "the evolution of an open quantum system ( @xmath0 ) can be written in the well known operator sum representation as : @xmath1 where the @xmath2 are the kraus operators related to the quantum map @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the identity in the hilbert space of the system . using the _ vec _ operation , defined by : @xmath5 and",

    ". a trivial case in which any intermediate division is possible corresponds to unitary evolutions .",
    "markovian evolutions also admit arbitrary intermediate steps .",
    "the intermediate map may fail to be cp only in the case of non - markovian evolutions .",
    "this _ divisibility criterion _",
    "@xcite is therefore a sufficient condition to detect non - markovianity .    in order",
    "the check the complete positivity of a map , we use the well known duality between cp maps and positive operators , expressed by the choi s theorem @xcite .",
    "first we define the unique dynamical matrix associated to the map : @xmath20 where latin and greek indices correspond to system and environment hilbert spaces , respectively .",
    "the choi s theorem states that the map ( @xmath3 ) is cp if and only if its dynamical matrix ( @xmath21 ) is a positive semidefinite operator . finally , to check the complete positivity of the intermediate map , we form the matrix of its super - operator by means of the product : @xmath22",
    "in the previous section , we reviewed the formalism of quantum maps and the divisibility criterion .",
    "we now apply such formalism to environments described by general fermionic quadratic hamiltonians , interacting with a qubit .",
