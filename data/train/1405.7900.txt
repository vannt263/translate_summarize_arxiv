    "on ut 2013 july 25.45 , the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) detected a new point source in the nearby galaxy m74 ( ngc 628 ) ; when the object appeared again and brighter the next night , loss alerted other astronomers to the presence of this new object . within days , spectroscopy revealed it to be a young type ii supernova , designated sn 2013ej @xcite . because its host is so nearby ( less than 10 mpc ; see section 5 ) and so well studied , and",
    "because the event was caught within a few days of the explosion , sn 2013ej provides a fine opportunity for us to study the properties of a massive star before and after it undergoes core collapse .",
    "i present here photometry of sn 2013ej in the @xmath8 passbands obtained at the rit observatory , starting one day after the announcement and continuing for a span of 179 days .",
    "section 2 describes the observational procedures , the reduction of the raw images , and the methods used to extract instrumental magnitudes . in section 3 , i explain how the instrumental quantities were transformed to the standard johnson - cousins magnitude scale .",
    "i illustrate the light curves and color curves of sn 2013ej in section 4 and comment briefly on their properties . in section 5 ,",
    "i discuss extinction along the line of sight to this event . in section 6 ,",
    "i discuss attempts to measure the distance to m74 , and use the expanding photosphere method ( epm ) to perform my own estimate ; i adopt a distance and convert the apparent magnitudes at peak to absolute magnitudes . visual measurements of this event collected by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) are compared to ccd @xmath7-band measurements in section 7 .",
    "i summarize the results of this study in section 8 .",
    "this paper contains measurements made at the rit observatory , near rochester , new york .",
    "the rit observatory is located on the campus of the rochester institute of technology , at longitude 77:39:53 west , latitude + 43:04:33 north , and an elevation of 168 meters above sea level .",
    "the eastern horizon is bright and dominated by a large pine tree .",
    "measurements during the first two weeks , and particularly on the very first night , were taken at low airmass and not far from the tree s branches .",
    "i used a meade lx200 f/10 30-cm telescope and sbig st-8e camera , which features a kodak kaf1600 ccd chip and astronomical filters made to the @xcite prescription ; with @xmath9 binning , the plate scale is @xmath10 per pixel . to measure sn 2013ej",
    ", i took a series of 30-second exposures through each filter , using the autoguider if possible ; the only guide star was very faint in the @xmath11-band , so most of those images were unguided . the number of exposures per filter ranged from 10 , at early times , to 15 or 30 at late times .",
    "i typically discarded a few images in each series due to trailing .",
    "i acquired dark and flatfield images each night , except for ut dec 17 ; the images from that night were reduced using dome flats taken the following evening . in most cases ,",
    "i chose to use dome flats over twilight sky flatfield images .",
    "i combined 10 dark images each night to create a master dark frame , and 10 flatfield images in each filter to create a master flatfield frame . after applying the master dark and flatfield images in the usual manner , i examined each cleaned target image by eye .",
    "i discarded trailed and blurry images and measured the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of those remaining .",
    "the xvista @xcite routines stars and phot were used to find stars and to extract their instrumental magnitudes , respectively , using a synthetic aperture with radius of 4 pixels (= @xmath12 ) , slightly larger than the fwhm ( which was typically @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "as figure [ fig : chartlabel ] shows , sn 2013ej lies in the outskirts of one of the spiral arms of m74 .",
    "how much light from other objects in the area falls into the aperture used to measure the supernova ?",
    "i examined high - resolution hst images of this region , using acs wfc data in the f435w , f555w and f814w filters originally taken as part of proposal go-10402 ( pi : chandar ) .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed analysis of the progenitor s light in these images . within a circle of radius @xmath12 centered on the sn s position are ten or so point sources of roughly equal brightness , with magnitudes of roughly @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the combined light of these sources is too small to make a significant addition to the light of the sn itself .",
    "however , a considerably brighter source lies at ra 01:36:48.55 , dec + 15:45:26.5 , a distance of @xmath17 to the southeast of sn 2013ej . comparing it to the progenitor in the hst images , i measure magnitudes of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21-band value agrees well with an entry in the usno b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "since this star lies at the edge of the synthetic aperture used to measure the sn , some of its light was attributed to the sn in my measurements . in the @xmath11 and @xmath7 images , sn 2013ej was at least 3.9 magnitudes brighter than this star at all times , and so the contaminating flux was at most a few percent . in the @xmath22 and @xmath21 images , on the other hand , this star s light may have been important at late times . in the last @xmath21-band measurement , for example , roughly one - sixth of the measured light may have come from this star .",
    "since the exact amount of contamination depends on details of the seeing and shape of the point - spread function on each night , i have made no correction for this effect ; but the late - time measurements reported here are slightly brighter than they ought to be , especially in the red passbands .    between july and early september , 2013 , i measured instrumental magnitudes from each exposure and applied inhomogeneous ensemble photometry @xcite to determine a mean value in each passband .",
    "starting on ut sep 11 , 2013 , in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , i combined the good images for each passband using a pixel - by - pixel median procedure to yield a single image with lower noise levels .",
    "i then extracted instrumental magnitudes from this image in the manner described above . in order to verify that this change in procedure did not cause any systematic shift in the results ,",
    "i also measured magnitudes from the individual exposures at these late times , reduced them using ensemble photometry , and compared the results to those measured from the median - combined images .",
    "as figure [ fig : indivmedian ] shows , there were no significant systematic differences .",
    "in order to transform the instrumental measurements into magnitudes in the standard johnson - cousins bvri system , i used a set of local comparison stars , supplied by the aavso in their chart 12459ca .",
    "these reference stars are listed in table [ tab : compstars ] , and figure [ fig : chartlabel ] shows their location .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to correct for differences between the rit equipment and the johnson - cousins system , i observed the standard fields pg1633 + 009 and pg2213 - 006 @xcite on several nights and compared the instrumental magnitudes to catalog values .",
    "linear fits to the differences as a function of color yielded the following relationships : @xmath23 in the equations above , lower - case symbols represent instrumental magnitudes , upper - case symbols johnson - cousins magnitudes , and @xmath24 the zeropoint in each band .",
    "stars a , b , c , d and e were used to set the zeropoint for each image .",
    "table [ tab : ritphot ] lists our calibrated measurements of sn 2013ej made at rit .",
    "the first column shows the mean julian date of all the exposures taken during each night . in most cases ,",
    "the span between the first and last exposures was less than @xmath25 days , but on a few nights , clouds interrupted the sequence of observations .",
    "contact the author for a dataset providing the julian date of each measurement individually .",

    "sn 2013ej is clearly a type iip event , defined by a period of roughly 60 days during which the apparent brightness decreases very slowly .",

    "[ fig:1999em_bv ] and [ fig:1999em_ri ] , one can see that sn 2013ej rises to and falls from an early peak in all four passbands , while sn 1999em has such a peak only in @xmath11 ; its light curve is nearly flat in the other passbands .",
    "the plateau phase ends slightly later in sn 1999em , and the drop to the late - time decline is very similar .",
    "the colors of sn 2013ej changed considerably at the blue end of the visible spectrum , but very little at the red end .",
    "as figure [ fig : colorcurves ] indicates , the @xmath214 color increased monotonically by about 1.5 magnitudes over one hundred days .",
    "the most rapid change occurred as the light curve fell after maximum in @xmath11 , but the increase then slowed during the plateau phase .",
    "the @xmath215 color , on the other hand , remained nearly constant , increasing by only 0.3 mag from maximum light to the plateau phase .",
    "the magnitude measurements after the end of the plateau phase are so noisy that it is hard to see any significant change in color at that time .",
    "one can compare the colors of sn 2013ej to those of sn 2003gd , another type iip sn in m74 ; this will inform the discussion of extinction in section 5 .",
    "however , since sn 2003gd was discovered long after maximum light , this comparison is restricted largely to the plateau phase , and one can not align the two events in time with any precision . figure [ fig : comparecolors ] shows the two events were very similar : sn 2003gd had a slightly smaller @xmath214 color , but only by 0.15 mag at most .",
    "there are several different methods one can use to estimate the extinction along the line of sight to sn 2013ej .",
    "one can begin with the effects of dust and gas within our own galaxy : the foreground milky way reddening to m74 is estimated by @xcite to be @xmath216 .",
    "note that this value is an average based on infrared maps with a beam size of order 6 arcminutes , which subtends roughly 17 kpc at the distance of m74 .    in order to determine the extinction due to material within m74 itself , one might use sn 2003gd as a probe .",
    "both it and sn 2013ej exploded within the outer southern arm of m74 , the former roughly 40 degrees farther along the arm from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the similarity of the colors of these events suggests that they suffered equally from reddening .",
    "@xcite use the colors of sn 2003gd itself , nearby stars , and nearby hii regions to derive @xmath217 ; this implies that the reddening contributions from m74 and the milky way are roughly equal .",
    "a more direct approach is to use high - resolution spectra of sn 2013ej itself to measure the absorption lines of neutral sodium ( na i ) , which are correlated with extinction along the line of sight . @xcite",
    "provide in their figure 3 a detailed graph of the spectrum centered on the nai d lines .",
    "as they state , this spectrum shows clearly the absorption lines due to gas within the milky way , but no evidence for any absorption by gas in m74 . using a digitized version of their spectrum , i measure the equivalent widths of the milky way components to be @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "the relationship in equation 9 of @xcite then yields @xmath220 i will adopt this value for all following analysis .    taking the relationships between reddening and extinction given in @xcite , one can compute the extinction in each passband to be @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 .",
    "if one were to choose the slightly higher reddening given by @xcite of @xmath216 , one would derive slightly larger extinctions of @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 .",
    "note that the adopted reddening is roughly @xmath229 mag smaller than that of sn 2003gd , which is consistent with the difference in the @xmath214 colors of the two supernovae during the plateau phase of their evolution .",
    "both the colors of the sn 2013ej and the high - resolution spectra of @xcite indicate that there was very little material along the line of sight within m74 , and little circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor itself .",
    "in order to calculate the absolute magnitude of sn 2013ej , one must know the distance to its host galaxy .",
    "many attempts have been made to determine this distance , using a variety of methods .",
    "the appearance of the brightest individual stars has been used to derive distance moduli of @xmath230 @xcite , @xmath231 @xcite , and @xmath232 @xcite . @xcite",
    "measured the angular sizes of the three largest hii regions to estimate @xmath233 .",
    "@xcite applied the standardised candle method of @xcite to spectra and photometry of sn 2003gd to derive @xmath234 ; they also determined a distance by assuming that sne 2003gd and 1999em were identical , yielding @xmath235 .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) to determine a precise value of @xmath236 .",
    "@xcite kindly provided results in advance of their publication of a distance based on the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) ; using hst images , they find @xmath237 .",
    "the expanding photosphere method ( epm ) applies basic physics to determine the distance to a supernova @xcite . using spectra or photometry ,",
    "one estimates the temperature of the photosphere at a set of times ; assuming that it radiates approximately as a blackbody , one can compute the luminosity per unit area . if the photosphere expands freely , then a combination of radial velocity measurements and the time since explosion permits one to compute the size of the photosphere .",
    "one can multiply these quantities to determine the luminosity of the photosphere , then compare to the observed brightness to find the distance to the event .",
    "following the procedures described by @xcite , i applied this technique to sn 2013ej .",
    "the temperature was calculated based on @xmath238 photometry ; the @xmath22-band values were ignored , due to the presence of strong h@xmath239 features . to estimate the uncertainties in the temperatures , i used a monte carlo approach :",
    "i generated thousands of instances of artificial photometric measurements by adding random gaussian noise to the actual magnitudes , then fit blackbody spectra to those artificial measurements .",
    "the temperatures derived from rit photometry ( after corrections for extinction ) are shown in figure [ fig : temps ] ; they are slightly larger than those computed by @xcite , which is somewhat surprising , since my adopted reddening is smaller than that of @xcite . however , both sets of temperatures , for the most part , do agree within the uncertainties of the rit values .",
    "since the rit dataset lacks spectroscopy , i adopted the radial velocities described in @xcite , covering epochs @xmath240 .",
    "the procedures of @xcite yield a semi - independent distance for each passband of photometric measurements ; they are not fully independent due to the photometric color corrections , and due to the combination of magnitudes into colors which are used to determine the temperature . plotting the time of each measurement against the ratio of angular size to photospheric velocity yields a graph in which the slope is the distance to the supernova , and the y - intercept is the time at which the size would be zero ; the actual time of explosion will be somewhat later , since the star s initial size will always be larger than zero .",
    "figure [ fig : distances ] shows the results of the analysis for all four passbands of rit photometry , and table [ tab : distances ] lists them .",

    "one might conclude that the time of the explosion is roughly @xmath247 , if one ignores the initial radius of the progenitor .",
    "the rise time , from explosion to maximum light , would then range from 14 days in @xmath11 to 26 days in @xmath21 , increasing monotonically with wavelength .",
    "this is considerably shorter than the values estimated for most of the sparsely - sampled type iip sne modelled by @xcite , but similar to the rise times for the well - observed type iip sn 2012aw @xcite .",
    "i give greatest weight to the pnlf @xcite and trgb @xcite methods , and so adopt a distance modulus of @xmath248 . using this value , and the extinction in each passband , one can calculate the absolute magnitude of sn 2013ej at maximum light ; the results are shown in table [ tab : absmax ] .",

    "+    how does this event compare to other type iip sne ?",
    "@xcite examine the absolute magnitudes of 29 type iip events , finding a mean value @xmath253 .",
    "it appears that sn 2013ej falls close to the middle of this distribution , indicating that it was typical of its class .",
    "because sn 2013ej was one of the closest supernovae in the past few decades , it was monitored intensively by visual observers . it provides us with a rare opportunity to compare visual measurements of a type iip supernova to ccd @xmath7-band measurements .",
    "i collected visual estimates from the aavso s website @xcite .",
    "there were a total of 119 measurements , all with validation flag value z , indicating that they had been checked only for typos and data input errors .",
    "the visual measurements cover the period @xmath254 , which starts shortly before maximum light and continues to the end of the plateau phase . for each of the ccd v - band measurements , i estimated a simultaneous visual magnitude by fitting an unweighted low - order polynomial to the visual measurements within @xmath255 days ; due to the decreasing frequency of visual measurements and the less sharply changing light curve at late times , the value @xmath255 was increased from 5 days to 8 days at jd @xmath256 and again to 30 days at jd @xmath257 .",
    "the differences between the polynomial and each v - band measurement are shown as a function of ccd @xmath214 color in figure [ fig : visual ] .",
    "an unweighted linear fit to these differences yields the relationship @xmath258 this is very similar to the relationship between visual and ccd @xmath7-band measurements of the type ia sn 2011fe found by @xcite : @xmath259    the fact that two sne of different type are perceived by human eyes in a similar fashion is consistent with the fact that their light is dominated by the continuum at these relatively early times .",
    "in fact , the degree to which eyes judge a supernova to be fainter as it grows redder agrees with the relationship for ordinary stars measured by @xcite , further suggesting that human eyes are responding primarily to the continuum emission of supernovae .",

    "the very low extinction along the line of sight , and the proximity of its host galaxy m74 , make this one of the brightest core - collapse supernovae since 1993 . as a result",
    ", many visual observers were able to monitor sn 2013ej for over three months ; the differences between their estimates and ccd @xmath7-band measurements reveal the same trend with color that one sees in type ia supernovae and in ordinary stars .",
