    "optical clocks have demonstrated great improvements in stability and accuracy over the microwave frequency standards . since the proposal of active optical clock  @xcite ,",
    "a number of neutral atoms with two - level , three - level and four - level at thermal beam , laser cooling and trapping configurations have been investigated recently  @xcite .",
    "the potential quantum - limited linewidth of active optical clock is narrower than mhz , and it is possible to reach this unprecedented linewidth since the thermal noise of cavity mode can be reduced dramatically with the mechanism of active optical clock .",
    "it has been recognized that active optical clock has the potential to improve the stability of the best atomic clocks by about 2 orders of magnitude  @xcite .    until now",
    ", the major experimental schemes of active optical clock are based on trapped quantum system and atomic beam quantum system . to the latter",
    ", the residual doppler shift will be the main limitation , thus the final accuracy and stability of two - level quantum system are limited by second - order doppler shift of thermal atomic beam .",
    "laser cooled and trapped quantum system provides a solution to this limitation .",
    "as for three - level quantum system , the system stability and accuracy are mainly affected by the light shift of pumping laser .",
    "four - level quantum system can overcome these limitations and thus will be a better choice for active optical clock with improved performance  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated several alkali metals including potassium , rubidium and cesium and found that the four - level quantum systems of these elements are appropriate choices based on the mechanism of active optical clock . here",
    "we take rubidium atom as an example .",
    "the population inversion can be realized as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "[ fig : figer1 ]    a 421.7 nm laser operating at @xmath3 to @xmath4 transition is used as pumping laser .",
    "first , the atoms at @xmath3 state are pumped to @xmath4 state , and then decay to @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath5 states by spontaneous transitions .",
    "second , the atoms at @xmath0 and @xmath5 states decay to @xmath6 and @xmath1 states respectively .",
    "third , the atoms at @xmath6 and @xmath1 states return to ground state @xmath3 and then are pumped to @xmath4 state by pumping laser again .",
    "this process continues until the population inversion is established between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states since the lifetime of 6s state is longer than that of 5p state .",
    "one should note that the population inversions are also built up between @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 states .",
    "we choose @xmath0 and @xmath1 states as the object of study in this paper because the population inversion between them is the greatest according to our calculation . at the same time",
    ", one should pay attention to the fact that the split of the two hyperfine levels of @xmath6 state is wider than that of @xmath1 state .",
    "so if we want to realize this active optical clock in experiment , the transition between @xmath0 and @xmath6 states will be a better selection for avoiding modes competition .",
    "once the population inversion is built up , a fabry - perot type resonator , with a bad cavity whose cavity mode linewidth is much wider than that of the laser gain profile , is used to realize active optical clock laser output . using the definition of @xmath10  @xcite , here @xmath11 is cavity loss rate and @xmath12 is gain medium linewidth .",
    "according to the mechanism of active optical clock  @xcite , the fabry - perot resonator should be pushed deep down into the bad - cavity regime @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum - limited linewidth of active optical clock based on four - level quantum system is expected to be narrower than hz .    in this report",
    ", we will present the result of the calculations of dynamical process of population inversion , and lasing process with a bad cavity .",
    "an experimental scheme is designed to realize rb four - level quantum system active optical clock .",
    "a pumping laser operating at 421.7 nm is used to realize population inversion of rb four - level quantum system .",
    "the rabi frequency of pumping laser is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is electric dipole matrix between @xmath3 state and @xmath4 state , @xmath16 is electric field strength of the pumping laser .",
    "the spontaneous decay rate is @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the relationship between light intensity of pumping laser and the rabi frequency is @xmath19 .",
    "if the pumping laser is 10 mw with beam waist 1 mm , and considering that @xmath20 mhz , the pumping rate from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is @xmath21 s@xmath22 .",
    "the saturation light intensity is @xmath23 mw/@xmath24 , and @xmath25 s@xmath22 for @xmath26 .",
    "so the rabi frequency @xmath27 can be set from @xmath28 s@xmath22 to about @xmath29 s@xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : figer2 ]    supposing that atoms are within a thermal gas cell or magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , part of the atoms would be pumped to @xmath4 state .",
    "atoms at @xmath4 state spontaneously decay to metastable states @xmath0 and @xmath5 and continue decaying to the lower sate .",
    "the atoms that return to @xmath3 state are repumped by the pumping laser .",
    "when the 421.7 nm pumping laser is operating on one of the two hyperfine structure energy levels of 5s ground state , a repumping laser can be added to close the atoms leakage to the other hyperfine structure energy level .",
    "we will not discuss the repumping laser function in this paper for simplicity .",
    "finally , the population inversion could be established between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "the whole process is clear after an approximate calculation in the following .",
    "the density matrix equations for rb atoms in a thermal gas cell interaction with the pumping light , based on the theories of interaction between atoms and light , are written in rwa - approximation as follows : @xmath30    the subscript numbers of the density matrix correspond to different energy levels shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath31 , @xmath32 and so on mean the probability of atoms in corresponding states .",
    "@xmath33 means energy shift and @xmath34 means power broadening .",
    "@xmath35 is frequency detuning of pumping light on the transition frequency and can be set to 0 .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 _ etc .",
    "_ are decaying rates related to the lifetimes of corresponding energy levels described in fig .  1 .",
    "the numerical solutions of the above equations are shown in fig .",
    "2 . it is obvious that under the action of pumping laser , the atoms at @xmath3 state decrease rapidly .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is caused by the assumption that the 421.7 nm pumping laser is monochromatic . at steady - state ,",
    "the value of @xmath38 is 8.4% and @xmath39 is 3.3% .",
    "this means the atoms in @xmath0 state are about 2.5 times as many as that in @xmath1 state , therefore the population inversion is built up . from fig .",
    "2 we can also conclude that the population inversion between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states is built up at a time scale of @xmath2 s. other population inversions between @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 states are established simultaneously .",
    "we can experimentally detect the fluorescence spectrum and calculate relative lines intensity to demonstrate whether these population inversions are built up .",
    "an optical resonant cavity could be applied to detect the probability of lasing transition between the inverted states @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the population inversion occurs . according to the classical laser theory ,",
    "the oscillating process could start up once the optical gain exceeding the loss rate .",
    "here we use a bad cavity ( @xmath40 ) to realize laser output .",
    "when the stimulated radiation starts and reaches the condition of self - oscillation , the laser oscillation is built up and then output the 1366.9 nm laser of active optical clock which will be used as laser frequency standards .",
    "the atom - cavity coupling constant @xmath41  @xcite is given as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "then the atom - cavity coupling constant @xmath41 can be written as @xmath45 .",
    "the variation range of @xmath41 is about from @xmath46 s@xmath22 to @xmath47 s@xmath22 for reasonable value of @xmath48 .",
    "the laser emission coefficient is @xmath49  @xcite , where @xmath50 ns considering the condition of @xmath51 in our case discussed here .",
    "define the cycle time for rb atoms through the passage of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 states with the action of 421.7 nm pumping laser during transition time as @xmath52 and @xmath53 ns for @xmath54 s@xmath22 neglecting other channel .",
    "thus the inverted atoms that are possible to emit photons per unit time is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the number of atoms in @xmath0 state and @xmath1 state .",
    "so the gain term of the rate equation for cavity photon number @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "the equations for emitted photons ( @xmath58 ) from the total atoms inside the cavity mode ( @xmath60 ) , together with corresponding density matrix equations are listed as follows . here",
    "we apply the form of semiclassical approximation of four - level quantum system  @xcite , then @xmath61    one should note that the variables @xmath62 _ etc .",
    "_ in these equations , which represent the number of atoms in the corresponding states , are different from those in equation ( 1 ) . at room temperature",
    "the number of rb atoms in the cavity mode is about @xmath63 with @xmath64 m@xmath65 .",
    "@xmath60 can be changed through the adjustment of temperature and @xmath48 . at @xmath66 , there are about @xmath67 atoms inside the cavity mode with the same mode volume . @xmath68 and others are all 0 at the beginning . the cavity loss rate @xmath69 , where @xmath12 = @xmath70 is the natural linewidth of clock transition for laser cooled atoms in mot , and @xmath70 equals to 12.9 mhz here . for atoms in thermal gas cell , we assume the coherent 421.7 nm pumping laser only pumps atoms with velocity near zero for simplicity , then the @xmath12 @xmath71@xmath70 holds approximately . to reduce the effect caused by the thermal noise of cavity",
    ", the cavity loss rate @xmath11 should be far greater than the natural linewidth of output laser ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we set @xmath73 in this paper .",
    "[ fig : figer3 ]   under different value of @xmath60.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    [ fig : figer4 ]   s@xmath22 , @xmath74 s@xmath22 and @xmath75.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    fig .",
    "3 describes the solutions for the photon number equation .",
    "the steady - state value of photon number @xmath76 decrease with the enhancement of atom - cavity coupling constant .",
    "the increase of total atoms inside the cavity mode has less influence over @xmath76 compared to the variation of @xmath41 .",
    "4 describes the dynamical lasing process with the action of pumping laser .",
    "we can conclude that a stable laser field is built up within laser cavity on condition that the population inversion is preserved .",
    "the steady - state photon number @xmath77 for @xmath74 s@xmath22 ( @xmath64 m@xmath65 ) and @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding output laser power @xmath78 is 0.7 mw .    since @xmath79",
    ", the quantum linewidth of the active optical clock can be approximated to be @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "therefor we can get the quantum - limited linewidth of rb four - level quantum system active optical clock in the magnitude of hz level .",
    "if @xmath81 s@xmath22 and @xmath82 s@xmath22 , the linewidth is 0.7 hz .    in consideration of the fact that the 421.7 nm pumping laser is far detuning from the 1366.9 nm clock transition laser , the light shift of @xmath83 clock transition caused by the 421.7 nm pumping laser can be written as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the detuning which equals @xmath86 hz . given the rabi frequency @xmath54 s@xmath22 , the light shift will be 0.18 hz . the stability of 421.7 nm pumping laser power can be better than @xmath87 , therefore the uncertainty of light shift due to pumping laser is less than 0.18 mhz .",
    "this means to four - level quantum system , the influence on system stability and accuracy induced by light shift is far less than that of two - level and three - level quantum systems .",
    "considering the mature technology of laser cooling and trapping of rb atoms , one can establish a 421.7 nm rb mot directly for rb active optical clock , and the cooling and trapping laser will play the pumping role also since its light shift is small enough .",
    "the lasing of rb four - level quantum system active optical clock can be realized by using a conventional fabry - perot resonator .",
    "but the difference is that the cavity loss rate @xmath11 far outweighs the natural linewidth @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig : figer5 ]     the length of this cavity @xmath88 is set to 1.5 cm , then the free spectral range is @xmath89 ghz .",
    "the fineness @xmath90 where @xmath91 . given @xmath92 ghz , from above equation",
    "we can get @xmath93 .",
    "thus we can determine @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "m1 mirror is coated with 421.7 nm anti - reflection coating and 1366.9 nm high - reflection coating .",
    "m2 mirror is coated with 421.7 nm high - reflection coating and the reflectivity of 1366.9 nm is 67% .",
    "the final output laser comes out from m2 .",
    "compared with other optical clock schemes , there are two interesting points of this experimental scheme .",
    "the first one is that the most parameters of atomic structure of alkali metals including rb have been measured precisely already .",
    "the second one is that the laser cooling and trapping technology of alkali metals including rb is currently very mature , thus the thermal gas cell can be replaced by magneto - optical trap for reducing the influence of doppler effect .",
    "the center frequency of four - level quantum system active optical clock is decided by the transition frequency of rb atoms , but not the laser cavity mode which is very sensitive to the vibration and fluctuation of temperature .",
    "the cavity mode of active optical clock can be locked to a reference cavity with low thermal noise  @xcite , then the cavity pulling reduced by a factor of @xmath10 will be smaller than mhz .",
    "active optical clock , whose quantum - limited linewidth of output laser is far narrower than the natural linewidth of atomic spectrum and its center frequency is not directly subject to cavity mode noise , can provide optical frequency standards with high stability and accuracy . considering the accuracy requirement , lasing of a three - level conventional laser is not so suitable for an active optical frequency standards because the light shift due to the high intensity pumping laser ca nt be tolerable .",
    "thus it needs special design of pumping scheme for active optical clock with three - level configuration  @xcite .    four - level quantum system active optical frequency standards not only possesses the advantages of active clock such as narrow linewidth and high stability and accuracy , but also overcomes the limitation on stability and accuracy due to light shift .",
    "rb atom four - level quantum system , as a typical example , is studied in detail .",
    "other alkali metals including potassium and cesium have similar four - level quantum systems structures and therefore are appropriate candidates for this novel scheme of active optical clock .",
    "the parameters of atomic structure of these atoms have been measured precisely already thus provides great convenience .",
    "take cesium as an example , the levels @xmath0 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 compose a four - level quantum system suitable for active optical frequency standards .",
    "population inversion in cesium atoms has been achieved in our preliminary experiment .",
    "it is expected to realize active optical clock based on four - level quantum system in our next experimental study .",
    "we mainly study atoms in thermal gas cell in this paper .",
    "it is valuable to notice that four - level quantum system based on atoms in mot can reduce the influence of doppler effect greatly . to reduce the effect of collision shift and decrease doppler effect further",
    ", magic wavelength lattice trapped atoms can be applied .",
    "we have identified several magic wavelengths for rb four - level quantum system active optical clock  @xcite . besides , laser cooling and trapping technology of alkali metals is very mature .",
    "so active optical lattice clock based on four - level quantum system atoms is expected to greatly improve the properties of atomic clocks .    in summary ,",
    "we propose a scheme of four - level quantum system active optical clock with rb atoms .",
    "our calculations show that the population inversion between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states of rb atom can be built up at a time scale of @xmath2s .",
    "with 421.7 nm pumping laser operating at @xmath3 to @xmath4 transition and @xmath67 atoms inside the cavity mode , the output laser power of rb four - level quantum system active optical clock can reach 0.7 mw for @xmath100 ghz .",
    "the quantum - limited linewidth can reach 0.7 hz . the stability of light shift can be smaller than 0.18 mhz with the rabi frequency of pumping laser @xmath101 s@xmath22 . other alkali metals like potassium and cesium are also suitable for four - level quantum system active optical clock . an experimental configuration to realize active optical frequency standards based on rb four - level quantum system",
