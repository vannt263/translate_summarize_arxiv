    "the prompt localization of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by bepposax led to the discovery of x - ray / optical / radio afterglows and associated host galaxies .",
    "subsequent detections of absorption and emission features at high redshifts ( @xmath1 ) in optical afterglows of grb and their host galaxies clearly demonstrate that at least some of the grb sources lie at cosmological distances ( for reviews , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a common feature of all acceptable models of cosmological @xmath2-ray bursters is that a relativistic wind is a source of grb radiation .",
    "the lorentz factor , @xmath3 , of such a wind is about @xmath4 or even more ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a very strong magnetic field may be in the plasma outflowing from cosmological @xmath2-ray bursters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a relativistic , strongly magnetized wind interacts with an ambient medium ( e.g. an ordinary interstellar gas ) and decelerates .",
    "it was pointed out ( @xcite ) that such an interaction , assumed to be shock - like , may be responsible for generation of cosmological grbs .",
    "the interaction between a relativistic , strongly magnetized wind and an ambient plasma was studied numerically by smolsky & usov ( 1996 , 2000 ) and usov & smolsky ( 1998 ) .",
    "these studies showed that about 70% of the wind energy is transferred to the ambient plasma protons that are reflected from the wind front .",
    "the other @xmath5% of the wind energy losses is distributed between high - energy electrons and low - frequency electromagnetic waves that are generated at the wind front because of nonstationarity of the wind ",
    "ambient plasma interaction ( see below ) .",
    "high - energy electrons , accelerated at the wind front and injected into the region ahead of the front , generate synchro - compton radiation in the fields of the low - frequency waves .",
    "this radiation closely resembles synchrotron radiation and can reproduce the non - thermal radiation of grbs observed in the ginga and batse ranges ( from a few kev to a few mev ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that grb might be sources of radio emission , and that it might be used to determine their distances and , through the dispersion measure , the density of the intergalactic plasma .",
    "here we consider some properties of the low - frequency waves generated at the wind front .",
    "we argue that coherent emission by the high - frequency tail of these waves may be detected , in addition to the high - frequency ( x - ray and @xmath2-ray ) emission of grbs , as a short pulse of low - frequency radio emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "our mechanism for production of short pulses of low - frequency radio emission from relativistic , strongly magnetized wind - generated cosmological grbs applies very generally . for the sake of concreteness , we consider wind parameters that are natural in a grb model that involves a fast rotating compact object like a millisecond pulsar or dense transient accretion disc with a surface magnetic field @xmath6 g ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this model the rotational energy of compact objects is the energy source of cosmological grbs .",
    "the electromagnetic torque transfers this energy on a time scale of seconds to the energy of a poynting flux - dominated wind that flows away from the object at relativistic speeds , @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the wind structure at a time @xmath8 is similar to a shell with radius @xmath9 and thickness of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the characteristic deceleration time of the compact object s rotation , or the dissipation time of a transient accretion disc",
    ".    the strength of the magnetic field at the front of the wind may be as high as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 cm is the radius of the compact object , @xmath14 is the angular velocity at the moment of its formation and @xmath15s@xmath16  cm is the radius of the light cylinder .",
    "the distance at which deceleration of the wind due to its interaction with an ambient gas becomes important is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the density of the ambient gas and @xmath19 is the initial kinetic energy of the outflowing wind .",
    "( 2 ) assumes spherical symmetry ; for beamed flows @xmath19 is @xmath20 times the wind energy per steradian . at @xmath21 , the main part of @xmath22",
    "is lost by the wind in the process of its inelastic interaction with the ambient medium , and the grb radiation is generated .",
    "substituting @xmath23 for @xmath24 into equation ( [ bobj ] ) , we have the following estimate for the magnetic field at the wind front at @xmath25 :    @xmath26    where we have introduced a parameter @xmath27 which gives the fraction of the wind power remaining in the magnetic field at the deceleration radius .",
    "for plausible parameters of cosmological @xmath2-ray bursters , @xmath28  g , @xmath14  s@xmath29 , @xmath30  ergs , @xmath7 and @xmath31 @xmath32 , from equation ( [ bdec ] ) we have @xmath33  g.    for consideration of the interaction between a relativistic magnetized wind and an ambient gas , it is convenient to switch to the co - moving frame of the outflowing plasma ( the wind frame ) . while changing the frame , the magnetic and electric fields in the wind are reduced from @xmath34 and @xmath35^{1/2 } \\simeq b$ ] in the frame of the @xmath2-ray burster to @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the wind frame .",
    "this is analogous to the the well - known transformation of the coulomb field of a point charge : purely electrostatic in the frame of the charge , but with @xmath38 in a frame in which the charge moves relativistically .",
    "using this and equation ( [ bdec ] ) , for typical parameters of cosmological @xmath2-ray bursters we have @xmath39  g at @xmath40 .    in the wind frame , the ambient gas moves to the wind front with the lorentz factor @xmath3 and interacts with it . the main parameter which describes the wind ",
    "ambient gas interaction is the ratio of the energy densities of the ambient gas and the magnetic field , @xmath41 , of the wind    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the density of the ambient gas in the wind frame and @xmath44 is the proton mass .    at the initial stage of the wind outflow , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , but it increases in the process of the wind expansion as @xmath41 decreases . when @xmath47 is @xmath48 ( at @xmath49 , the interaction between the wind and the ambient gas is strongly nonstationary , and effective acceleration of electrons and generation of low - frequency waves at the wind front both begin ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ) . for @xmath50 , the mean lorentz factor of outflowing high - energy electrons",
    "@xmath51 accelerated at the wind front and the mean field of low - frequency waves @xmath52 weakly depend on @xmath47 ( see table 1 ) and are approximately given by    @xmath53    to within a factor of 2 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the magnetic and electric field components of the waves .",
    "the mechanism of generation of these waves is coherent and consists of the following : at the wind front there is a surface current that separates the wind matter with a very strong magnetic field and the ambient gas where the magnetic field strength is negligible .",
    "this current varies in time because of nonstationarity of the wind - ambient gas interaction and generates low - frequency waves .",
    "at @xmath56 , for the bulk of high - energy electrons in the region ahead of the wind front the characteristic time of their synchrotron energy losses is much less than the grb duration . in this case , the luminosity per unit area of the wind front in @xmath2-rays is @xmath57 while the same luminosity in low - frequency waves is @xmath58 . using these ,",
    "the ratio of the luminosity in low - frequency waves and the @xmath2-ray luminosity is    @xmath59    from table 1 , we can see that the grb light curves in both @xmath2-rays and low - frequency waves have maximum when @xmath47 is about 0.4 , and the maximum flux in low - frequency waves is about two times smaller than the maximum flux in @xmath2-rays ( @xmath60 ) . at @xmath61",
    "the value of @xmath62 decreases with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the undispersed duration @xmath63 of the low - frequency pulse to be somewhat smaller than the grb duration , and the energy fluence in low - frequency waves to be roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the energy fluence in @xmath2-rays .",
    "the rise time of the radio pulse is very short because that the value of @xmath64 increases very fast when @xmath47 changes from 0.3 to 0.4 ( see table i ) .",
    "figure  1 shows a typical spectrum of low - frequency waves generated at the wind front in the wind frame .",
    "this spectrum has a maximum at the frequency @xmath65 which is about three times higher than the proton gyrofrequency @xmath66 in the wind field @xmath41 .",
    "taking into account the doppler effect , in the observer s frame the spectral maximum for low - frequency waves is expected to be at the frequency    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the cosmological redshift . for typical parameters of cosmological grbs , @xmath39 g and @xmath69",
    ", we have @xmath70 mhz .",
    "unfortunately , the bulk of the low - frequency waves is at low frequencies , and can not be observed .",
    "however , their high - frequency tail may be detected .    at high frequencies , @xmath71 ,",
    "the spectrum of low - frequency waves may be fitted by a power law ( @xcite ) :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 . in the simulations of the wind ",
    "ambient gas interaction ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ) both the total numbers of particles of the ambient gas and the sizes of spatial grid cells are restricted by computational reasons , so that the the spectrum ( [ bnu ] ) is measured reliably only at @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitudes of the computed oscillations with @xmath75 are so small ( @xmath76 ) that they can not be distinguished from computational noise ( @xcite )",
    ". future calculations with greater computational resources may alleviate this problem .",
    "the value of @xmath77 depends on many parameters of both the grb bursters and the ambient gas around them , and its estimate , @xmath70 mhz , is uncertain within a factor of 23 or so . in the most extreme case",
    "in which @xmath77 is as high as a few  mhz , the high - frequency tail of low - frequency waves may be continued up to @xmath5 mhz where ground - based radio observations may be performed . in this case , the energy fluence in a pulse of radio emission at @xmath78 mhz may be as high as a few percent of the grb energy fluence in @xmath2-rays .",
    "a pulse of low - frequency radio emission is strongly affected by intergalactic plasma dispersion in the process of its propagation . at the frequency @xmath79 ,",
    "the radio pulse retardation time with respect to a grb is    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the intergalactic dispersion measure in electrons/@xmath82 , @xmath83 is the group velocity of radio emission , @xmath84 is the refractive index and @xmath79 in hz . from equation ( [ taunu ] ) , for the plausible parameters of @xmath85 @xmath32 and a distance of @xmath86 cm , at @xmath87 mhz we have @xmath88 s. this is time enough to steer a radio telescope for the radio pulse detection . in equation ( [ taunu ] ) , we neglected the radio pulse retardation time in our galaxy , which is typically one or two orders of magnitude less than that in the intergalactic gas .",
    "the observed duration of the low - frequency pulse at the frequency @xmath79 in the bandwidth @xmath89 is    @xmath90\\ , .",
    "\\label{deltatnu}\\ ] ]    for plausible parameters , @xmath91 mhz , @xmath92 mhz , @xmath93 s and @xmath94 s , we have @xmath95 s ; the observed duration of low - frequency radio pulses is determined by intergalactic plasma dispersion , except for extremely long grbs .",
    "it is now possible to estimate , given assumed values for the magnetic field , the amplitude of the signal produced .",
    "we also assume that the plasma field couples efficiently to the free space radiation field . for a radio fluence @xmath96 and a radio fluence spectral density @xmath97",
    "the radio spectral flux density is @xmath98 for the latter ( dispersion - limited ) case with the parameters @xmath99 erg @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 mhz , @xmath87 mhz , @xmath104 mhz , @xmath105 s we find @xmath106 jy .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath107 is very uncertain . in some models it may be @xmath108 , but for grb with sharp subpulses its value is limited by the requirement that the magnetic stresses not disrupt the thinness of the colliding shells ( @xcite ) . for subpulses of width @xmath109 of the grb width",
    "this suggests @xmath110 ; typical estimates are @xmath111 and @xmath112 , leading to @xmath113 jy .",
    "these large values of @xmath114 may be readily detectable , although the assumed values of @xmath107 are very uncertain .",
    "there are additional uncertainties .",
    "we have assumed that the radio pulse spectrum ( 11 ) is valid up to a frequency @xmath115 mhz that may be hundreds of times higher than @xmath77 . as discussed above",
    ", the spectrum ( 11 ) of low - frequency waves is calculated directly only at @xmath116 . at @xmath117 ,",
    "the spectrum must be extrapolated , with unknown confidence , from the calculations .",
    "the radio spectral flux density at @xmath115 mhz may therefore be less than the preceding estimates .",
    "however , even in this case the very high sensitivity of measurements at radio frequencies may permit the detection of coherent low - frequency radio emission from grb .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that grbs may be accompanied by very powerful short pulses of low - frequency radio emission . for detection of these radio pulses",
    "it may be necessary to perform observations at lower frequencies than are generally used in radio astronomy , which are limited by the problem of transmission through and refraction by the ionosphere .",
    "in particular , observations from space are free of ionospheric refraction and are shielded by the ionosphere from terrestrial interference .",
    "although even harder to predict , detection from the ground at higher frequencies may also be possible .",
    "space observations are possible at frequencies down to that at which the interstellar medium becomes optically thick to free - free absorption .",
    "this frequency is @xmath118 where @xmath119 @xmath32 ) and @xmath120k ( @xcite ) , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the interstellar electron density and temperature , respectively , and @xmath123 is the galactic latitude . the expression @xmath124 may be @xmath108 , but could be substantially larger if the electrons are strongly clumped or cold . on the other hand , although much of the interstellar volume is filled with very hot ( @xmath125k ) and radio - transparent gas , this probably contains very little of the electron column density .",
    "intergalactic absorption poses a somewhat less restrictive condition if the medium is hot ( @xmath125k ) , as generally assumed .    at these low frequencies , and even at tens of mhz , interstellar scintillation ( @xcite ) will be very large .",
    "observations of coherent radio emission from grb would not only illuminate the physical conditions in their radiating regions , but would determine ( through the dispersion measure ) the mean intergalactic plasma density and ( through the scintillation ) its spatial structure .    the flux density implied by eq .",
    "( [ rflux ] ) appears impressively large , but it applies only to the brief period when the dispersed signal is sweeping through the bandwidth @xmath126 of observation , so that it is unclear if it is , in fact , excluded by the very limited data ( @xcite ) available .",
    "further , the extrapolation of the radiated spectrum to @xmath127 is very uncertain .",
    "finally , we have also not considered the ( difficult to estimate ) temporal broadening of this brief transient signal by intergalactic scintillation , which will both reduce its amplitude and broaden its time - dependence .",
    "searches for radio pulses started about 50 years ago , prior to the discovery of grbs . during wide beam studies of ionospheric scintillations ,",
    "simultaneous bursts at 45 mhz of @xmath128 s duration were reported by smith ( 1950 ) at sites 160 km apart .",
    "these events were detected at night , approximately once a week .",
    "the origin of these bursts was never determined .",
    "the results of smith ( 1950 ) were not confirmed by subsequent observations at frequencies of 150 mhz or higher .",
    "modern observations ( @xcite at 151 mhz ; @xcite at 74 mhz ; @xcite broadband ; see @xcite for a review ) set upper bounds to the brightnesses of some grb at comparatively high frequencies .",
