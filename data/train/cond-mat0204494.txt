    "in this paper we study chemical gelation , i.e. the equilibrium transition from a liquid ( sol ) to an amorphous solid ( gel ) which is induced by the introduction of permanent random crosslinks between the particles of the liquid .",
    "the classical theory of gelation , as developed by flory and stockmayer @xcite , assumes a tree like connectivity of the random macromolecular networks generated in the process of gelation and vulcanization .",
    "the critical exponents are those of mean - field percolation .",
    "stauffer @xcite and de gennes @xcite used instead the lattice connectivities of finite dimensional percolation , embedding the gelation transition in the context of critical phenomena .",
    "the resulting critical exponents are those of three - dimensional percolation theory , in contradiction with the classical values .",
    "experimental support has accumulated for the non - classical values @xcite and , in addition , given evidence for the size of the critical region , outside of which mean - field exponents prevail @xcite .",
    "one concludes that the geometric connectivity of gels is well described by percolation theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal properties of gels are beyond the scope of percolation theory and have in recent years been addressed with statistical mechanics , considering both geometric and thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a mean - field picture has been developed @xcite and a renormalization group analysis @xcite has been carried out for the fluid side of the transition . thereby the approach of statistical mechanics has been connected to percolation theory . however , the structural and elastic properties of finite - dimensional gels are still only known within mean - field theory .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the _ gel _ phase for an ensemble of crosslinks , which is given by continuum percolation .",
    "this is _ not _ the deam - edwards distribution @xcite , which has been used frequently in the statistical approach . after a short introduction of the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss geometrical properties of the network , generated by three - dimensional percolation , e.g. we investigate correlations in connectivity of neighboring sites and compute the number of small loops ( sec .",
    "[ sec : xlinks ] ) .",
    "subsequently we set up a mayer - cluster expansion for the crosslinked melt ( sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion ] ) .",
    "our effort is not directed towards the critical behavior of the gelation transition , which was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ; rather we want to find out , whether the characteristics of the gel phase as described by mean - field theory , survive in a finite - dimensional model .",
    "we recall that already on the level of a mean - field theory one needs a distribution of length scales to characterize the local static density fluctuations of the gel phase .",
    "our aim is to find out in how far this picture has to be modified in a short - range model .",
    "the lowest diagram of the mayer cluster expansion leads back to mean - field theory ( sec .",
    "[ sec : truncations ] ) , which is expected to be appropriate deep in the gel phase away from the transition point .",
    "we compute the distribution of localization lengths for all connectivities .",
    "for the strongly connected gel we find a multi - peak structure of the distribution , such that each coordination number corresponds , to leading order , to a well - defined localization length .",
    "subsequently the first correction to mean - field theory within the mayer - cluster expansion is calculated .",
    "the critical connectivity is increased due to the existence of small loops , which do not increase the cluster size .",
    "the gel fraction and the distribution of localization lengths change only quantitatively , as compared to mean - field theory and the critical exponents remain the same as long as we only consider bare perturbation theory and do not resum the mayer - cluster expansion .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : deamedwards ] , we discuss a general class of crosslink distributions , which includes the deam - edwards distribution as well as the distribution of @xmath0-dimensional percolation .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 identical classical particles , confined to a @xmath0-dimensional volume @xmath2 with the average density of particles @xmath3 being constant in the thermodynamic limit @xmath4 .",
    "the particle positions are denoted by @xmath5 , with @xmath6 running from 1 to @xmath1 .",
    "the interactions are given by the hamiltonian @xmath7 here , @xmath8 describes the particle interactions in the fluid , without crosslinks , and is given by a sum over single - particle and pair potentials .",
    "permanent random crosslinks are introduced between @xmath9 pairs of particles , numbered by @xmath10 .",
    "two monomers , participating in a crosslink , are forced to remain close to each other .",
    "we model this constraint by an attractive pair potential @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest choice is a harmonic one , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the strength of the crosslink coupling .",
    "it has been shown that the harmonic potential is equivalent to crosslinks represented by hard constraints in the limit @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "note that further geometrical constraints arise indirectly via the interlocking of closed loops of crosslinks , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "these effects are not taken into account in the above hamiltonian .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the symmetric @xmath15 connectivity matrix @xmath16 with entries @xmath17 these entries equal one , whenever @xmath6 and @xmath18 are linked together , and zero otherwise .",
    "multiple crosslinks are excluded .",
    "harmonic interactions due to the crosslinks can thus be represented by @xmath19 the thermal degrees of freedom are the positions of the monomers .",
    "the set of crosslinks @xmath20 represents the quenched disorder of the model , so that the monomers equilibrate in the presence of a fixed , non - equilibrium configuration of crosslinks .",
    "all thermodynamic properties can be obtained from the partition function @xmath21 which still depends on the quenched disorder @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 denotes the inverse temperature .",
    "one usually assumes that the gibbs free energy , @xmath24 , is self - averaging in the thermodynamic limit , and thus computes its average over all crosslink realizations , @xmath25 .",
    "in this section , we give an explicit formula for the distribution of crosslinks corresponding to @xmath0-dimensional percolation .",
    "it is based on the intuitive picture that a given number of crosslinks @xmath9 is introduced simultaneously and instantaneously into the fluid of monomers .",
    "the crosslinks are strictly bivalent and connect pairs of monomers by a chemical bond . given the instantaneous ( or more realistically fast ) reaction , pairs of monomers which are nearby in the instant of crosslinking , have a high probability to be connected , whereas pairs of monomers which are distant , have a very small probability to be crosslinked .",
    "the assumption of a fast crosslinking reaction as compared to the diffusive time - scale of the fluid molecules is realistic and becomes better and better the closer one gets to the gelation transition , because larger and larger clusters are built up and give rise to increasingly longer relaxation times of the molecules in the fluid .",
    "the distribution is generated in two steps :    \\1 ) a liquid configuration @xmath26 ( an instant ) of a @xmath0-dimensional fluid is generated , by randomly choosing @xmath1 points in @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "one possibility is to generate liquid configurations with the boltzmann weight of the uncrosslinked system , thereby including short - range correlations of the fluid .",
    "such a procedure will be discussed in sec .",

    "( [ rdependence ] ) ensures the proper normalization .",
    "the average of an observable @xmath36 over all crosslink configurations @xmath22 is given by @xmath37 note that the integration over @xmath27 is part of the averaging over all crosslink distributions and should not be confused with thermal averages .",
    "sometimes , it is technically simpler to allow the total number of crosslinks to fluctuate . to this end , we replace the second step in the above procedure by the following :    2 ) given the configuration @xmath27 , choose each crosslink independently , as described by a factorized distribution @xmath38 which explicitely excludes multiple crosslinks .",
    "the function @xmath39 should take values @xmath40 and be of finite range .",
    "it will be convenient to assume a gaussian shape @xmath41 the `` crosslinking - length '' @xmath42 is chosen comparable to the mean distance between particles , @xmath43 , in order to guarantee an extensive number of crosslinks ( see the following section ) .",
    "the average ( [ average ] ) of an observable over all crosslink configurations , now equivalently denoted by @xmath44 , is then replaced by @xmath45    before discussing the physics of the crosslinked system , we will investigate some geometrical properties of the network of crosslinks .",
    "special emphasis is given to local structures which are characteristic for the low - dimensional structure of the network .",
    "they differ substantially from the properties of diluted random graphs @xcite which give the proper mean - field description of the disorder distribution .      to start with",

    "fluctuations around the mean are of order @xmath51 , and hence small compared to @xmath52 .",
    "we therefore expect the differences between the ensembles with fixed and fluctuating number of crosslinks to disappear in the thermodynamic limit .      the simplest local property of the crosslink network is given by the distribution of coordination numbers .",
    "the average fraction of particles being connected to exactly @xmath53 other particles is given by @xmath54 where the last expression describes the limiting distribution for @xmath55 .",
    "it is thus found to equal a poissonian of mean @xmath56 .",
    "the same coordinations are found in the long - ranged case @xmath57 .",
    "differences to the long - ranged case show up in nonlocal features , as connectivity correlations and occurrence of loops .",
    "to study connectivity correlations , we consider the coordination numbers of particles which are directly connected by a single crosslink .",
    "given a large network , we determine the ( asymptotic ) probability that a randomly and uniformly selected crosslink has endpoints of coordinations @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "this quantity is given by the sum over all links , which have one endpoint connected to @xmath58 and the other endpoint connected to @xmath59 particles , normalized by the total number of crosslinks @xmath60 the disorder distribution of eq.([eq : probability ] ) allows to compute the average up to summations @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes again the average connectivity .",

    "similarly , particles of high coordination are likely to be surrounded by other high - coordinated particles .",
    "this effect can be understood intuitively : low coordination of a particle @xmath6 corresponds to a small number of other particles inside the effective crosslinking volume @xmath65 centered in @xmath66 . due to the overlap of this volume with the crosslinking volume of the neighboring particles",

    "the presented derivation can be easily generalized to more complicated local structures , always giving rise to extensive numbers decreasing exponentially with growing spatial dimension .",
    "after having discussed some geometrical properties of the random networks generated according to finite - dimensional percolation , we go back to the original physical model of a crosslinked fluid , as given by eq .",

    "we discuss the order parameter of the gel phase and show how to compute local static density fluctuations within a mayer - cluster expansion .      as discussed previously @xcite ,",
    "the sol - gel transition is an equilibrium phase transition from a liquid state ( sol ) to an amorphous solid state ( gel ) . in the gel",
    "a finite fraction of particles is localized in the vicinity of fixed equilibrium positions . increasing the number of crosslinks , localization first occurs , when a macroscopic cluster of crosslinked molecules appears , i.e. at the percolation threshold .",
    "hence the fraction of localized particles is determined by the mass of the macroscopic cluster .    due to the random crosslinks",
    ", the equilibrium positions of the localized particles do not exhibit any periodic structure , but are random .",
    "the gel is an amorphous solid , but still all macroscopic properties have to be translationally invariant . in particular ,",

    "all particles are free to explore the whole container and hence any particular one is equally likely to be in any sub - volume .",
    "this implies @xmath81 and hence @xmath82 . in the gel phase , however , a finite fraction of all particles is part of the macroscopic cluster and thus localized . in the simplest model @xcite",
    ", one assumes gaussian localization @xmath83 around homogeneously distributed random localization centers @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the localization length , characterizing the extent of thermal fluctuations around the preferred position @xmath84 .",
    "the second moment is then given by @xmath86 the second moment is thus expressed in terms of the distribution of localization lengths @xmath87 which is expected to be rather broad due to the inhomogeneous environment of different particles : some particles are expected to be strongly localized due to high local connectivity ( steep local potentials ) , whereas particles e.g. on dangling bonds are expected to exhibit larger spatial fluctuations , corresponding to larger localization lengths .",
    "the gelation transition occurs , when the connectivity per particle is @xmath88 .",
    "hence , there is no reason to assume gaussian static density fluctuations , and the second moment ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) is not sufficient to completely characterize the structure of the gel phase .",
    "instead , the full distribution of local static density fluctuations is required , or , equivalently , all moments @xmath89 within mean - field theory , it has been shown that all higher moments can be expressed in terms of @xmath90 , according to @xmath91 so that the structure is characterized by a single function , the distribution of localization lengths . whether or not this result holds beyond mean - field theory is an open question .",
    "our aim is the computation of the partition function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : z1 ] ) .",
    "the most important pair potential @xmath92 is the excluded volume interaction .",
    "it is known that the crosslinked melt without excluded volume will collapse .",
    "hence we can not simply set @xmath93 . here",
    "we introduce instead a lagrange parameter to ensure the constraint of homogeneous density . to this end",
    "we choose @xmath94 and consider @xmath95 as a lagrangian multiplier coupled to the single - particle density .",
    "it will be determined such that the single particle density remains homogeneous .",
    "technically it is much simpler to work with single - particle potentials instead of the excluded volume interaction .",
    "we expect the model to be self - averaging in the macroscopic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ intensive observables should not depend on the particular disorder realization , but only on the statistical ensemble of crosslinks .",

    "the central question is whether or not molecules are bound in the sense , that @xmath111 stays finite for a finite fraction of all molecules @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as we will see in the following , unbound molecules may be identified with the sol fraction , bound molecules with the gel fraction which appears only at or above the gelation transition .",
    "having in mind the interpretation of the replicated and ( partially ) disorder - averaged system as an effective fluid , we can use the classical concepts of equilibrium statistical mechanics of fluids @xcite , in particular the mayer - cluster expansion in the diagrammatic formulation of @xcite .",
