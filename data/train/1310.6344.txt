    "the subject of this paper is fractal tilings of @xmath0 and , more generally , complete metric spaces . by  fractal \" , we mean that each tile is the attractor of an iterated function system ( ifs ) .",

    "tilings constructed from an ifs often possess global symmetry and self - replicating properties .",
    "research on such tilings include the work of numerous people including akiyama , bandt , gelbrich , gr \" ochenig , hass , kenyon , lagarias , lau , madych , radin , solomyak , strichartz , thurston , vince , and wang ; see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "even aperiodic tilings can be put into the ifs context ; see for example the fractal version of the penrose tilings @xcite .",
    "the use of the inverses of the ifs functions in the study of tilings is well - established , in particular in many of the references cited above .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a simple , yet unifying , method for constructing tilings from an ifs .",
    "many examples appearing in the literature in ad hoc ways , as well as new examples , can be constructed by this method .",
    "the usefulness of the method is demonstrated by showing by applying it to the construction of fractal transformations between basins of attractors of pairs of ifss .",

    "the tilings constructed in the non - overlapping case , in section  [ sec : non - overlapping ] , include well known examples such as the digit tilings , crystallographic tilings , and non - periodic tilings by copies of a polygon , as well as new tilings in both the euclidean and real projective planes .",
    "the tilings constructed in the overlapping case , in section  [ sec : o ] , depend on the choice of what is called a mask and are new",
    ". theorems  [ thm : basinn ] , [ thm : random ] , and [ thm : basino ] state that , in both of the above cases , when the attractor has nonempty interior , the resulting tiling very often covers the entire space .",
