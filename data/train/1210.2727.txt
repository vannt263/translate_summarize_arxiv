    "the distribution of galaxies in the universe is not uniform  galaxies are found in filamentary structures , groups and clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) . the observed ` cosmic web ' structure is in good agreement with numerical simulations according to cold dark matter cosmology ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , whereby gravity drives the formation of structure from small , primordial , gaussian fluctuations .",
    "dark matter haloes grow through merging and accretion of smaller ones . within the dark matter",
    "haloes , galaxies form by cooling of baryons ( e.g. @xcite ) . hence , small dark matter haloes are the primordial building blocks of larger structures in the hierarchical model of structure formation .    dwarf irregular galaxies with low stellar luminosity and low surface brightness galaxies are typically discovered in neutral hydrogen ( hi ) surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as they are rich in neutral gas but difficult to detect in optical or infrared surveys . whilst optical surveys are most sensitive to high surface brightness early - type galaxies @xcite , hi surveys are unbiased by stellar populations and are most likely to detect gas - rich late - type spirals and irregular galaxies . hence optical and hi surveys complement each other as there is a rough correlation between increasing hi content from early to late type galaxies and decreasing optical surface brightness with morphological type @xcite",
    ". discoveries in hi surveys also include intriguing objects , e.g. the detection of an hi - massive cloud without stellar counterpart , within the ngc2442 group @xcite , extended hi arms or tidal tails @xcite and hi between galaxies in groups ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "large - area blind hi surveys have been conducted such as the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss , @xcite ) , the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs , @xcite ) , the hi jodrell all - sky survey ( hijass , @xcite ) , the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa , @xcite ) and the arecibo galaxy environment survey ( ages , @xcite ) .",
    "upcoming hi surveys such as the askap hi all - sky survey ( known as wallaby , @xcite ) will further contribute to our knowledge of gas - rich galaxies in the local universe .",
    "isolated galaxies tend to have noticeably different properties from galaxies residing in dense regions .",
    "observations have shown that early - type galaxies are common in clusters whereas late - type galaxies dominate the less dense environments ( morphology - density relation ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of environment and the idea of transformation of galaxies in dense environments arose when @xcite discovered that galaxy clusters at higher redshift contain a population of blue galaxies which nearby galaxy cluster counterparts are missing .",
    "however , it is still a matter of debate , which properties correlate with the decrease of blue galaxies from high- to low - redshift galaxy clusters , e.g. x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , richness ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , cluster concentration ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , presence of substructure ( @xcite ) , cluster velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite discuss the correlation between star formation rate and local projected density .",
    "the authors find low star formation rates at 2 - 3 virial cluster radii  which is equivalent to poor galaxy group densities .",
    "therefore , galaxies may be preprocessed in groups , as physical processes in the studied clusters can not solely account for the observed variations in galaxy properties .",
    "galaxy transformation as a smooth function of environment is also suggested by @xcite in terms of a _ kinematic _ morphology - density relation , i.e. separation into fast and slow rotators .",
    "there have been a number of studies on the effect of environment on the hi content of galaxies in clusters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and loose groups ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . through observations of isolated galaxies",
    ", we can define the expected hi mass in normal spiral galaxies of a particular linear optical diameter and morphological type .",
    "in dense regions , such as clusters , there is often an hi deficiency observed , indicating that hi gas is removed from galaxies in these environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations have found a similar hi deficiency in the less dense group environments ( @xcite , @xcite ) indicating that the spirals may begin to lose their hi reservoir well before reaching the dense centre of a cluster .",
    "an ideal target to study the effect of environment on the evolution of gas - rich galaxies , is the nearby ursa major cluster and its surroundings as most of the known member galaxies are late - type galaxies .",
    "the ursa major cluster is quite different in its nature compared to the well - known and similarly distant virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "generally clusters are composed of hundreds of gas - poor early - type galaxies clustered around a central larger elliptical ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ursa major cluster is smaller ",
    "@xcite identified 79 high - probability cluster members .",
    "the cluster is essentially composed of late - type galaxies , in particular spiral galaxies with normal gas content , that are not centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "this lack of a concentration towards any core and the overlap with many groups nearby the cluster might explain why the ursa major cluster is less studied compared to the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "the several groups nearby the ursa major cluster make studying its dynamics a complex problem and the cluster difficult to define ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite define the cluster members to lie within a projected 7.5@xmath6 circle centered at @xmath7 and with heliocentric velocities between 700 and 1210  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the cluster lies at a distance of 17.1  mpc @xcite .",
    "the few previous studies of the ursa major cluster have found that it has a low velocity dispersion of only 148  km s@xmath1 , a virial radius of 880  kpc @xcite and no x - ray emitting intra - cluster gas has yet been detected @xcite .",
    "the ursa major cluster has a total mass of @xmath8  m@xmath4 @xcite and a b - band absolute luminosity of @xmath9  l@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "compared to the virgo cluster this is about 30  per  cent of its light but only 5  per  cent of its mass ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the number of hi - rich galaxies in ursa major is comparable to those in virgo @xcite and the ursa major cluster almost meets the abell richness 0 standard . to qualify as an abell richness class 0 the criteria are ( _ i _ ) 30 galaxies in b or ( _ ii _ ) 26 in r within 2  mag of the third brightest galaxy .",
    "the ursa major cluster is slightly short - 29 galaxies in b and 25 in r @xcite .",
    "besides ursa major , only the virgo cluster has such a high abundance of hi - rich galaxies on a 2  mpc - scale in the nearby universe ( @xmath10  3000  km  s@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that the mostly late - type galaxies in the ursa major cluster do not seem to be seriously affected by tidal interactions indicating that the system is in an _ early evolutionary state_. however , @xcite studied 43 spiral galaxies in detail and found 10 interacting systems that show distorted morphologies and tidal debris .",
    "there is a deficiency of known dwarf galaxies in the ursa major cluster  there are only two dozen dwarfs , whereas up to @xmath11 could be expected to be found if the same steep luminosity function claimed for virgo was valid for the ursa major cluster @xcite . to date , ( _ i _ ) the small number of dwarf galaxies , ( _ ii _ ) the low velocity dispersion , ( _ iii _ ) the non - detection of x - ray emitting intra - cluster gas , ( _ iv _ ) the low abundance of elliptical galaxies in the cluster and ( _ v _ ) the total mass @xmath12 challenge the question `` why not call it a group ? ''",
    ". clusters usually have a broader velocity distribution , a hot intra - cluster gas which can strip the galaxies off their hi gas and an enhanced population of both the early - type ( s0 and e ) galaxies and the hi depleted spiral galaxies .",
    "as the majority of the ursa major members are hi - rich spiral galaxies such as those one finds in the field , the distinction between the ` ursa major cluster ' as opposed to an ` ursa major group ' is nt clear .",
    "one hypothesis is that ursa major is a _ newly forming cluster _ given that the estimated crossing time is approximately half a hubble time , in contrast to virgo and fornax where the crossing times are 0.08 and 0.07 @xmath13 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the catalogue of hi sources as detected in the first blind hi survey of the ursa major region ( approximately 480  deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "the analyzed region overlaps with the canes venatici region for which @xcite have conducted a deep blind hi survey ( hi mass sensitivity @xmath14  m@xmath4 ) using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in an area of 86  deg@xmath0 ( @xmath15  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "our hi data were obtained as part of the hi jodrell all sky survey ( hijass ) . the data acquisition and determination of the hi sources",
    "are described in section  [ sec : obs ] including a discussion of the catalogue completeness and reliability .",
    "the hi properties of the sources are presented in a catalogue in section  [ sec : cat ] .",

    "first results and basic property distributions of the hijass sources are presented in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "furthermore , we identify galaxy pairs / systems that are high - probability candidates for galaxy - galaxy interactions and discuss four systems in detail , two of which show strikingly extended hi content .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will investigate the nature of the ursa major cluster / group and probe the hypothesis that it is a _ newly forming cluster_. we will study substructures and their dynamics , and present dynamical masses , total mass - to - light ratios etc .",
    "for both individual galaxies and the subregions . furthermore , to investigate the hi properties of galaxies residing in different density regions , we will analyze the hi sources in the ursa major cluster and compare them to galaxies residing in foreground groups and the less dense filament connecting the ursa major with the virgo cluster , which lies south of canes venatici .",
    "the hi data cubes analyzed in this paper were obtained in 20012002 as part of the hi jodrell all sky survey ( hijass ) @xcite .",
    "the blind hi survey was conducted using the 4-beam receiver mounted on the 76.2-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory , uk .",
    "hijass covered more than 1000  deg@xmath17 in the northern sky ( @xmath18 ) complementary to ( _ i _ ) the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) which surveyed the entire southern sky ( @xmath19 ) from 1997 to 2000 @xcite and ( _ ii _ ) the northern extension to hipass ( @xmath20 ) carried out in 2000 to 2002 @xcite .",
    "hijass provides the first blind hi survey of the nearby ursa major cluster and its surroundings . to investigate the ursa major region we only consider velocities in the range 300 to 1900  km  s@xmath21 ( all velocities are given in the optical convention @xmath22 ) .",
    "sources with systemic velocities below 300  km  s@xmath1 are excluded to minimize confusion with high - velocity clouds and galactic emission ",
    "an exception are 15 obviously real galaxies with systemic velocities between 150 and 300  km  s@xmath1 that are included in the catalogue .",
    "we note that hijass data suffers from a broad band of radio - frequency interference between 4500 and 7500  km  s@xmath21 @xcite , which lies outside our studied velocity range .",
    "the ursa major region is covered by seven hijass data cubes measuring @xmath23 and one hijass cube measuring @xmath24 in size ( the sky coverage is approximately 480 deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "the cubes span a range in right ascension ( ra ) between 10@xmath2545@xmath26 and 13@xmath2504@xmath26 and a range in declination ( dec . ) between 22@xmath6 and 54@xmath6 .",
    "we note that the analyzed region overlaps with the canes venatici region for which @xcite have conducted a deep blind hi survey in an area of 86  deg@xmath0 ( @xmath15  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the hijass cubes have a spatial pixel size of @xmath27  arcmin@xmath0 . in the third dimension ,",
    "the channel spacing is 62.5  khz which corresponds to an increment of 13.2  km  s@xmath1 at the rest frequency of hi .",
    "the velocity resolution is 18  km  s@xmath1 after smoothing to reduce ` ringing ' caused by galactic emission ( applying 25 per cent tukey filter ) .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) noise level in the analyzed data is 1214  mjy  beam@xmath21 . to minimize edge effects",
    "the overlapping hijass data cubes are mosaiced to one mega - cube . for further information on data reduction ,",
    "the lovell telescope and hijass see @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution of the lovell telescope at 1.4  ghz is 12.0  arcmin @xcite .",
    "the gridding process ( using similar parameters as for hipass ) slightly degrades the angular resolution ( see @xcite ) . according to @xcite",
    "the resultant beam size is not well - defined and depends on smoothing radius , pixel size , source position , shape and strength ( signal - to - noise ratio ) as the gridding is a non - linear process .",
    "one can only assess the gridded beam size by analysing simulations and synthetic source injections . to determine the gridded beam size , we inject synthetic point sources into the raw data and measure their properties after the gridding process .",
    "we determine the full width at half - maximum beamwidth ( fwhm ) of a two - dimensional gaussian fit to the synthetic sources , analogous to @xcite .",
    "the measured beamwidths vary as a function of source peak brightness ( in jy  beam@xmath1 , which corresponds to jy for point sources ) . given a wide range of peak flux densities in the presented catalogue ",
    "the majority of sources have @xmath28  mjy and a few strong sources range to 3.5  jy in peak flux density  we determine two appropriate beamwidths : ( _ i _ ) 13.1@xmath290.9  arcmin for the majority of sources with @xmath30  300  mjy and ( _ ii_)12.4@xmath290.6  arcmin for sources with @xmath31  300  mjy .",
    "the peak and integrated fluxes of point sources are preserved during the gridding process but for extended sources , the peak and integrated fluxes require a correction : we calculated the correction factors by similarly injecting synthetic extended sources into the raw data and measure their properties after the gridding process ( analogous to @xcite ) .",
    "the correction factors for extended sources as a function of fwhm are given in table  [ tab : corr_factors ] .",
    "we obtain this function by fitting a third order polynomial to the median data points ( with @xmath32 of 99.9% ) . in our catalogue ( section  [ sec : catalogue ] ) , we quote both the measured and corrected fluxes for extended sources .",
    "+ coefficient & @xmath33 & @xmath34 +   + @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + @xmath44 & 1.112 & 1.003 +   +    [ tab : corr_factors ]      we use the automated source finder duchamp-1.1.8 @xcite on the hi data cube to compile our initial candidate galaxy list .",
    "duchamp is based on a threshold method and searches for groups of adjacent pixels in position and velocity that are above the given threshold , which is estimated from the cube statistics ( in jy  beam@xmath1 ) or alternatively specified from the user as a peak flux density value .",
    "furthermore the user can ( _ i _ ) reduce the noise prior to the searching via wavelet reconstruction and/or smoothing ( spatial or spectral ) and ( _ ii _ ) control various parameters such as the minimum extent of the detections in pixels and/or channels .",
    "duchamp provides a list of the hi detections and their properties , the hi spectra and integrated hi intensity maps ( moment zero ) .",
    "the duchamp outputs need to be inspected carefully as hi sources are occasionally merged .",
    "we can identify such sources by eye and separate them when they do not overlap both spatially and spectrally .",
    "we made a comprehensive test of various input parameters and methods to facilitate duchamp detections of low peak flux and extended hi sources without disproportionally increasing noise detections ( see section  [ sec : reliability ] and [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "we first apply a spectral hanning smoothing to the hijass data and then reconstruct them with the `  trous ' wavelet method .",
    "hanning smoothing correlates neighbouring pixels in the spectral domain and determines the weighted average flux over a certain number of channels  the channel spacing remains 13.2  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we determine that the optimal hanning smoothing width for the data is seven channels ( see section  [ sec : reliability ] ) .",
    "the wavelet method reconstructs each spectrum separately and we chose the following criteria when compiling the duchamp detection list : ( _ i _ ) the detection must be contiguous in two channels and ( _ ii _ ) the peak flux density of the candidate galaxies must be above 16  mjy .",
    "this is an approximate 2.5@xmath45 peak flux density threshold as the mean noise level in the smoothed and reconstructed cube is @xmath466.6  mjy  beam@xmath1 .    in this paper ,",
    "we only consider 5@xmath45 detections in peak flux in the edge - masked hijass megacube to present a reliable and complete catalogue of hi sources in the ursa major region within 300 to 1900  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum in peak flux density of 33  mjy and an hi mass limit of @xmath47 m@xmath4 ( assuming a velocity width of 100  km  s@xmath1 and a distance of 17.1  mpc ) .",
    "these selection criteria lead to a duchamp detection list with 140 candidate galaxies including merged detections ( doubles to quads ) that are labelled in section  [ sec : catalogue ] .",
    "to test the reliability of the @xmath48 peak flux duchamp detection list , we investigate the negative troughs in the edge - masked hijass cube .",
    "when using the selection criteria as discussed in section  [ sec : duchamp ] , we identify 25 negative troughs with @xmath49  mjy and @xmath50  26.4  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "all 25 negative troughs can be associated with negative bandpass sidelobes , i.e. an artifact of bandpass removal which is apparent north and south of strong hi sources ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this lack of negative detections ( noise peaks ) indicates that the positive duchamp candidate galaxy list with @xmath51  33  mjy and @xmath50  26.4  km  s@xmath1contains high - probability real hi sources .",
    "hanning smoothing is known to enhance the brightness of sources  on the scale of the smoothing width  with respect to the noise in each channel map , but reduces the peak strength ( signal - to - noise ) of sources on other scales .",
    "@xcite shows that an appropriately chosen smoothing width can still increase the recovery rate of sources on different scales than the smoothing width as the noise level is suppressed .",
    "however , to prevent loss of information on different scales , we also use the wavelet reconstruction to further suppress the noise and to enhance structures on various scales ( narrow and broad profiles ) . using wavelet reconstruction",
    "also suppresses noise peaks , baseline ripples or radio - frequency interferences as discussed in @xcite . for further information on duchamp and",
    "the noise suppression methods see @xcite .",
    "some restrictions on spatial and spectral extent of duchamp detections greatly improve the reliability , such as the applied minimum number of channels ( @xmath52 ) in which the detection must be contiguous @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria as listed in section  [ sec : duchamp ] are chosen to limit the number of false detections and to present a reliable catalogue of hi sources in the ursa major region in this paper .",
    "the reliability of the catalogue is increased by follow - up observations and rejection of unconfirmed sources from the catalogue .",
    "we re - observed 17 apparent first time detections in hijass with the green bank telescope ( gbt , fwhm 9  arcmin )  nine of which have an associate optical counterpart that match in position and velocity to the hi detection and eight candidate galaxies / hi clouds without a previously catalogued optical counterpart .",
    "the rms noise level is between 4 and 7  mjy for hi sources with an associate optical counterpart and approximately 3  mjy for the candidate galaxies / hi clouds .",
    "given that the lowest peak flux density of the candidate galaxies / hi clouds is 33  mjy , this will lead to signal - to - noise detections @xmath53 .",
    "the velocity resolution of the gbt data is 3.3  km  s@xmath1 after boxcar smoothing .",
    "the gbt follow - up observations confirmed all nine hi sources with an associate optical counterpart .",
    "however , only one out of the eight candidate galaxies / hi clouds was confirmed , namely hijass  j1219 + 46 .",
    "therefore , 7 initial duchamp detections are excluded from the presented catalogue in this paper . inspecting the original as well as the smoothed and resonstructed data cubes by eye",
    "reveal that the unconfirmed detections are noise peaks on top of large - scale baseline ripples .",
    "duchamp provides an option ` flag baseline ' which removes the baseline from each spectrum prior to compiling the detection list .",
    "however , we did not utilize this option as not only does it remove all candidate galaxies / hi clouds from the detection list , some of the faint hi detections with an associate optical counterpart were not included as well .      [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      blind hi surveys have the potential for detecting previously uncatalogued galaxies and hi clouds .",
    "the two largest blind hi surveys to date are hipass ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and alfalfa ( @xcite , @xcite ) . while the hipass catalogues contain numerous sources without optical or infrared counterpart ( e.g. in regions of high galactic extinction ) , there is no evidence for any optically dark galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most massive star - less hi clouds is hipass  j0731 - 69 ( @xmath54  m@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is located near the asymmetric spiral galaxy ngc  2442 in the ngc  2434 group .",
    "a possible sceanrio for its origin is discussed in @xcite .",
    "australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations by @xcite reveal several hi clumps that are probably embedded in a common envelope of diffuse hi .",
    "a group of hi clouds found around 400  km  s@xmath1 , including hipass  j171264 @xcite , hipass  j171859 and hipass  j161655 @xcite , are likely tidal debris related to the magellanic clouds and the leading arm . in areas of high stellar density and dust obscuration",
    ", it can be difficult to detect optical or infrared counterparts to hi - detected galaxies .",
    "apart from the galactic plane , other sources  like the magellanic clouds  may hide the stellar component of galaxies .",
    "an example is hipass  j0546 - 68 ( @xmath55  km  s@xmath1 ) behind the lmc @xcite .",
    "the alfalfa 40  per  cent survey has detected nearly 16,000 hi sources in the velocity range from @xmath56 to @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 @xcite , among these are 1013  sources without assigned optical counterparts . of the latter ,",
    "814 are at velocities from @xmath56 to @xmath58  km  s@xmath1 , i.e. likely to be hvcs .",
    "the remaining are hi cloud candidates , with @xmath59  per  cent located near galaxies of similar redshifts ( e.g. leo ring , @xcite ) .",
    "about 50 candidates ( 0.3  per  cent ) for isolated hi clouds remain ; these require follow - up optical and interferometric hi observations to identify their nature .    in our survey of the ursa major region",
    "we were able to confirm just one hi source without a definite optical counterpart ( hijass  j1219 + 46 ; @xmath60  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is located near the peculiar galaxy ngc  4288 ( hijass  j1220 + 46 ; @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 ; also see @xcite and @xcite ) in the canes venatici region .",
    "this hi source is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : new ] .",
    "the nature of this hi source could be a dwarf companion or tidally stipped gas .",
    "hi imaging and deep optical follow - up will be required to determine the true nature .",
    "the first blind hi survey of the ursa major region was conducted in 20012002 as part of hijass .",
