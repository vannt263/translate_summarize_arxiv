    "the standard model , the general theory of particle physics was established more than 40 years ago .",
    "it describes our world as consisting of two kinds of elementary particles , fermions and bosons , differing by their spin , intrinsic angular momentum : fermions have half - integer , bosons have integer spins measured in units of @xmath0 , the reduced planck constant .",
    "the elementary fermions have three families , each consisting of one pair of quarks and one pair of leptons ( table [ tab : smpart ] ) .",
    "every fermion has an antiparticle of the opposite charge .",
    "the leptons can propagate freely , but the quarks are confined in hadrons : they can only exist in bound states of three quarks , baryons ( like the proton and neutron ) or those of a quark and an antiquark , mesons ( like the pion ) .",

    "a gauge symmetry is a freedom to define the coordinate system measuring the strength of an interaction , the best known example of which is the freedom to choose the potential zero of an electric field .",
    "a local symmetry is its modified form when the gauge is changing in space - time according to a known function .",
    "the three basic interactions are mediated by elementary bosons : the strong nuclear force by 8 gluons , the weak interactions by the three heavy weak bosons and the electromagnetism by the photon . in order to cancel uncomfortable terms from equations",
    "the theory also needs the existence of an additional scalar boson , a particle with all its quantum numbers like charges and spin zero .",
    "local gauge symmetries give correct answers to important questions except the mass of elementary particles : one has to violate them in order to get non - zero masses .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) mechanism was introduced in several steps to particle physics and it is now an integral part of the standard model .",
    "it is called , somewhat unjustified , also the higgs mechanism , although it is the product of several people , so it could also be called _ brout  englert  higgs  guralnik  hagen  kibble _ mechanism @xcite .",
    "these days we try to call it beh mechanism by the initials of those who have first published it . as the scalar boson",
    "was first introduced by peter higgs , it is justly called higgs boson .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism consists of adding to the electroweak vacuum a potential which breaks its perfect symmetry .",
    "the form of this potential is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a complex doublet field of four components and @xmath4 is a real constant .",
    "if @xmath5 then it is a scalar field with a non - zero mass @xmath6 and a potential minimum at @xmath7 .",
    "however , if @xmath8 then it has a non - zero minimum @xmath9 @xmath3 can be chosen so that it had just one real component and then expanded around its minimum , _ vacuum expectation value _ @xmath10 as @xmath11 the @xmath3 field is imposed onto the vacuum of the @xmath12 combined local gauge symmetries , breaking them . here @xmath13 the hypercharge of the fermion ( where @xmath14 is the electric charge and @xmath15 is the third component of the weak isospin , see table  [ tab : smpart ] ) , and @xmath16 acts on left - polarized fermion doublets . as the photon has zero mass , from the neutral part of the electroweak lagrangian we separate a good @xmath17 using relation ( [ eq : hypch ] ) between electric charge @xmath14 and hypercharge @xmath18 , and the rest gives a correct weak interaction with three massive gauge bosons , w@xmath19 and z. as a result of this manipulation , 3 components of the @xmath3 field become the longitudinal polarizations ( masses ) of the 3 @xmath20 gauge bosons and the fourth component makes the scalar higgs boson .",
    "the charged currents of the weak interaction , mediated by w@xmath19 are pure @xmath16 whereas z is the result of the unification , thus they have different masses and z mediates a right - handed neutral current as well .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is well illustrated by a mexican hat ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssb ] ) .",
    "its axial symmetry is not violated by putting a ball on its top , however , the ball will eventually go down and break the original symmetry .",
    "ssb makes it possible to introduce masses in the theoretical equations : masses for the heavy weak bosons , w@xmath21 , w@xmath22 and z@xmath23 mediating the weak interaction and also masses for the basic fermions , the quarks and leptons .",
    "there is a substantial difference , however : whereas the masses of the weak bosons appear as a result of ssb , and so they are predicted by the standard model , the fermion mass terms have to be added ad hoc to the standard model lagrangian as a triple interaction among the left - polarized fermion doublet , the ( [ eq : beh - doublet ] ) beh doublet and the right - polarized fermion singlet field with arbitrary coupling constants giving the fermion masses .",
    "the beh field introduces 2 free parameters in the standard model ; as the vacuum expectation value can be determined from the fermi coupling constant ( @xmath24 gev ) , the only adjustable parameters left in the electroweak theory are the @xmath25 and @xmath20 coupling constants and the masses of the fermions and of the higgs boson .",
    "note that the masses of our macroscopic world are mostly due to the energy content of the proton and neutron and not due to the beh mechanism .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking : the beh potential .",
    "the axial symmetry of the potential is not violated by putting a ball on the top at @xmath7 , but it will be spontaneously broken when the ball rolls down in the valley .",
    "however , the coordinate system can always be chosen so that the ball were at point @xmath26 . ]    since almost 40 years , more and more precise new data were acquired at the particle accelerators and all seem to agree very well with the predictions of the standard model .",
    "hundreds of experiments are summarized in the few parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : show_pull ] according to the lep electroweak working group @xcite .",
    "it shows the 2012 situation of the analysis of electroweak data : all experimental data and theoretical estimates agree within the statistical boundaries .",
    "the only parameter which deviates at more than 2 uncertainties is the forward - backward asymmetry of the decay of the z boson to two b quarks .     various parameters of the standard model @xcite : average measured values ( 2nd column ) with uncertainties ( 3rd column ) , the predictions or fits by the standard model ( 4th column ) and a bar plot showing the differences between theory and experiment divided by the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the agreement is purely statistical as the difference is in only one case more than 2 uncertainties . ]",
    "the higgs boson of the standard model is the only scalar particle : all of its quantum numbers are zero , its only property is mass . fitting experimental data predicts that the higgs mass should be around 100 gev ( between 80 and 160 gev within 95% confidence ) .",
    "all constituents of the standard model were identified and studied experimentally before the launch of the lhc , apart from the higgs boson , that is how it became the most wanted particle . as peter higgs himself told @xcite `` it was in 1972 ... that my life as a boson really began '' .",
    "the statistical methods used by particle physicists are as different from the _ official _ mathematical statistics as mechanical engineering from the lagrangian or hamiltonian formulation of theoretical mechanics . at the same time statistics",
    "is extremely important for data analysis in particle physics : every few years international workshops are organized by particle physicists working at the large hadron collider to exchange ideas on statistical methods , the last one having been in 2011 @xcite . in the appendix of that volume _ eilam gross",

    "every high - energy collaboration has phystatistician experts and they all have quite different ideas how to analyze data . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "the large lhc collaborations have statistics committees which publish home pages of recommendations how to do things .",
    "the statistics committees of both cms and atlas have several members who published text books on statistics for physicists and atlas and cms have a joint such committee as well .    as in high energy physics",
    "the primary experimental data are basically event counts , the basic concepts are poisson - like .",
    "the data follow the poisson distribution ( @xmath28 events in bin @xmath29 ) :   @xmath30 and the result is usually expressed in terms of the poisson likelihood : @xmath31 .",
    "the expected number of events is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the integral luminosity collected , @xmath34 is the cross section of source @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the efficiency ( determined by monte carlo simulation ) of source @xmath35 in bin @xmath29 .",
    "luminosity is the rate of collecting data for colliders , similar to the flux of fixed - target experiments .",
    "it is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the circulation frequency of the colliding beams ; @xmath39 is the number of particle bunches in the ring ; @xmath40 are the numbers of particles in the two kinds of bunches ; @xmath41 is the spatial overlap of the colliding bunches .",
    "the total number of collisions is characterized by the integrated luminosity : @xmath42 which is usually measured in units of inverse cross - section , at lhc in @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the expected rate of a reaction with cross section @xmath44 at @xmath45 detection efficiency is @xmath46 .    according to the general convention in accelerator experiments a given new phenomenon",
    "is excluded if we can show it not appearing at a @xmath47 confidence level and observed if it exceeds @xmath48 above background where now , for a change , @xmath44 is the experimental uncertainty according to the best honest guess of the experimentalist .",
    "that @xmath44 uncertainty has a _ statistical component _ from the number of observed events and _ systematic _ ones from various sources , like monte carlo statistics and inputs , experimental calibration factors , detection efficiencies , etc , with the common name _",
    "nuisance parameters_. to get a rough estimation of the total error the systematic uncertainties could be added quadratically to the statistical one : @xmath49 , but in practice we derive the final uncertainty via marginalizing ( integrating out ) @xcite the nuisance parameters @xmath50 in likelihood @xmath51 using the related probability distributions @xmath52",
    ".    another important feature of high - energy data analysis is the _ blind analysis _",
    "@xcite : `` a blind analysis is a measurement which is performed without looking at the answer .",
    "blind analyses are the optimal way to reduce or eliminate experimenter s bias , the unintended biasing of a result in a particular direction . ''",
    "it came from medical research and the idea is to optimize , prove and publish your analysis technique using simulations and earlier data only before touching new data in the critical region .",
    "for instance , in spring and early summer , the 2012 cms data were blinded in the invariant mass region @xmath54 gev ( where @xmath55 is the simulated higgs mass ) because of the @xmath56 excess observed in 2011 .",
    "the same procedure was used again in autumn 2012 .",
    "the methods had to be fixed and approved by the collaboration before simultaneous _ unblinding _ for all analysis channels .",
    "what we usually try to observe is a resonance . for a particle with lifetime @xmath57 and decay rate @xmath58 the event rate against the invariant mass of the decay products",
    "is @xmath59 , i.e. a lorentz curve ( breit - wigner resonance ) .",
    "it shows a peak at the @xmath60 invariant mass of the decaying system with a full width at half maximum @xmath58 .",
    "the discovery of a new particle can be claimed if we see a resonance at the same invariant mass of the particle in all expected decay channels , by all related experiments .",
    "many hopeful new observations were disproved as statistical fluctuations by other experiments , and a few stayed unproven as not confirmed .",
    "the search involves several consecutive steps .    *",
    "compose a complete _ standard model background _ using monte carlo simulation taking into account all types of possible events normalized to their cross - sections .",
    "* compose _ higgs signals _ , simulations of all possible production and decay processes with all possible higgs - boson masses . *",
    "put all these through the _ detector simulation _ to get events analogous to the expected measured ones .",
    "* _ optimize the event selection _ via reducing the @xmath61 background and enhancing the @xmath62 signal via maximizing e.g.   @xmath63 or @xcite @xmath64 . *",
    "_ check the background _ , i.e.  the description of data by the simulation for the given luminosity : the simulation should reproduce the observed background distributions in all details .",
    "for instance , you can check the background of the decay of a neutral particle to charged leptons by selecting lepton pairs of identical charges .",
    "* _ check the signal : _ does it agree with the expectation by the theoretical model ?    once you are happy with the simulations and the event selection , you must chose a test statistic .",
    "that could be any kind of probability variable characteristic of the given phenomenon : probabilities for having background only , for having signal or combinations .",
    "one of the favorite is the @xmath14 likelihood ratio of signal + background over background : @xmath65 . as you see , although our basic approach is definitely frequentist there is a certain bayesian influence as well .",
    "what most frequently plotted is    @xmath66 $ ]    here the variables are the following :    * @xmath67 : events observed in channel @xmath68 ,   @xmath69 .",
    "* @xmath70 and @xmath71 : signal and background events in channel @xmath68 for higgs mass @xmath72 . * @xmath73 and @xmath74 : probability distributions for events for higgs mass @xmath72 at test point @xmath75 . * @xmath75 : position of event @xmath35 of channel @xmath68 on the plane of its reconstructed higgs mass and cumulative testing variable constructed of various special features of the event like b - tagging , signal likelihood , neural network output , etc .",
    "several other testing variables can be constructed on the same basis , the most frequently used ones are probabilities of not having the expected signal on the basis of the expected background and the collected data :    * @xmath76 , the signal confidence level assuming background only , i.e. the complete absence of the signal , or * the so - called _",
    "@xmath77value _ : the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed , assuming that the null hypothesis is true . translated to our language that means the probability that random fluctuation of the measured background could give the observed excess ( if any ) .",

    "figure [ fig : aleph - event ] shows a higgs - boson - like event detected by aleph in the 4-jet channel .    statistics played a rough joke at lep : one of the experiments , aleph , saw in one of the possible higgs decay channels a very significant signal corresponding to a higgs boson of a mass of 115  gev/@xmath81 , while the rest of lep have not seen anything @xcite ( fig .

    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cms_p - val ] : the significance is already as high as @xmath91 for the data available in july 2012 . it was a joke of statistics that in july 2012 adding together two decay channels , h  @xmath88 and h  @xmath95 gave the same @xmath91 significance for both atlas and cms whereas adding to it the results for other channels increased the significance to @xmath96 for atlas and left it at @xmath91 for cms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cms_p - val ] ) .",
    "analyzing most of the data collected in 2012 confirmed the existence of the new boson and led to the conclusion that all observed properties of the newly discovered particle are within statistics close to those predicted for the higgs boson of the standard model .",
    "the fact that it decays to two photons points to its having spin 0 or 2 .",
    "the charged lepton spectra bears the features of its having @xmath97 as ascertained by both experiments @xcite .",
    "its mass as determined by cms  @xcite , the average of all decay channels is @xmath98 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cms_mass_xsec ] ) .",
    "the atlas result is almost exactly the same @xcite : @xmath99 .",
    "the differences in the uncertainties are due to the facts that atlas had more signal - like data , but also got more different masses in the two main channels .",
    "the measured signal strengths of the new particle are also compatible with that expected for the standard model higgs boson : for cms it is @xmath100 less while for atlas @xmath101 more than the sm prediction , but both deviations are within the experimental uncertainties . as a theoretician remarked whenever atlas has an excess cms comes up for everybody s annoyance with a deficit , bringing the average close to the sm prediction .    the relative signal strengths in the most significant decay channels normalized to the predictions of the standard model for @xmath102  gev against the invariant masses of the new boson as measured by cms@xcite .",
    "the two data points agree within statistics with each other and with the expectations of the standard model . ]",
    "the lhc experiments studied the cross sections of the processes connected to the new particle .",

    "atlas got similar results , of course .",

    "thus what we found is very likely the standard model higgs boson . on one hand",
    "this is a great success of particle physics . on the other hand",
    "this is somewhat of a disappointment as the sm has theoretical shortcomings which need new physics to resolve .",
    "just to list a few of them : it can not unite the interactions at large energies , can not account for the dark matter of the universe and can not explain neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are many extensions of the theory which should result in deviations from the standard model .",
    "most of those problems can be resolved e.g.  by _ supersymmetry _ , but none of its predicted phenomena could be found yet experimentally .",
    "the observables of the higgs boson should be sensitive to some of the features of new physics and these studies will be the main job of atlas and cms in the future , from 2015 when the lhc will restart with twice the energy and luminosity of 2012 .",
    "it is very interesting that the 126 gev mass of the higgs boson seems to be exciting for theoreticians , there was even a special workshop @xcite organized to discuss this mass in 2013 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath103  gev is at the border line of the stability of electroweak vacuum on the plane of top mass against higgs mass , see e.g.  @xcite . at the madrid workshop",
    "the apparent fine tuning of the standard model compelled some physicists to recall the anthropic principle .",
    "as the lhc discovery gradually ripened many people asked who will get the nobel prize if the higgs boson is discovered . there were even rumors that the nobel committee might consider the give it to cern and to the two collaborations , although that would have been against the nobel tradition . by march 2013",
    "it was already quite clear that the new particle is actually a higgs boson and very probably that of the standard model . in the end of september 2013 the blogs started speculate about higgs and englert as robert brout passed away in 2011 .",
    "indeed , in october franois englert and peter ware higgs received the 2013 nobel prize in physics `` for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles , and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle by the atlas and cms experiments at cern s large hadron collider .
