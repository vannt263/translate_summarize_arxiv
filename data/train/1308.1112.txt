    "theories which violate lorentz symmetry can result in a modified photon dispersion relation which manifests itself in an energy ( or frequency ) dependent speed of light in vacuum @xcite . at high energies , this vacuum speed of light could depend , to leading order , linearly or quadratically upon photon energy , and this energy dependence could either decrease or increase with energy .",
    "such modified dispersion relations are common in theories of quantum gravity @xcite . as an experimental consequence ,",
    "simultaneously emitted photons of different energies traveling over a long baseline will become temporally separated .",
    "the energy dependence of the arrival time of photons from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) has been used to place limits on the energy scale of quantum gravity or the scale at which possible liv may occur @xcite .",
    "grbs are bright , violent bursts of high energy photons lasting on the order of fractions to hundreds of seconds , making them an apt source for study ; indeed , their brightness makes observation at high redshift possible . from grb 080916c , the observation of @xmath4(gev ) photons probes liv effects at the planck scale @xcite .    though the matter density of space is low , it is not truly a vacuum .",
    "matter comprises nearly thirty percent of the universe s energy budget @xcite , and over large scales , this matter density is relatively uniform @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming majority of this matter is some yet unknown dark matter ( dm ) . through its gravitational interaction , the existence of dm",
    "is established from a concordance of astronomical observations from different cosmological epochs @xcite .",
    "little is known about dm except for the fact that it is not relativistic , must be stable on the scale of billions of years , and interacts very little through non - gravitational channels .    since the universe does contain matter , when taken _ en masse _ , this engenders the cosmos with an index of refraction .",
    "rather generically , this index of refraction is dispersive ; that is , the phase velocity for light traveling through the medium is frequency dependent .",
    "similar to liv effects , light traveling over long baselines through a dispersive medium will suffer a frequency - dependent time lag .",
    "these matter effects could confound potential claims of liv gleaned from grb photon arrival times .",
    "herein , we assess the dispersive effects of the matter in the cosmos .",
    "since dm comprises the bulk of the matter in the universe , we will consider it in detail .    at the particle level",
    ", the index of refraction of a bulk medium arises from the forward scattering of photons on the particles that comprise the medium .",
    "photons directly couple to charged particles , yet the refractive index for neutral particles is also typically nonzero .",
    "we emphasize that a dark - matter particle need not have an electric charge to scatter a photon .",
    "for example , it can be electrically neutral but possess an electric or magnetic dipole moment , but such moments are not generic properties of dm candidates . indeed",
    ", majorana fermions can not have permanent dipole moments , and the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment requires time - reversal and parity violation .",
    "for the case in which the dm has no permanent dipole moments , the dm medium can still have a nonzero polarizability and , hence , index of refraction , provided that the dm particle couples to other electromagnetically charged particles . classically , the polarizability of a substance is a measure of an external electric field s ability to induce dipole moments in the molecules that comprise the substance . in the simplest case ,",
    "say for a spherically symmetric atom , an external electric field exerts opposite forces on the protons and electrons , resulting in a nonzero dipole moment parallel to the external field . at leading order ,",
    "this substance s polarizability is proportional to the applied electric field ; however , higher order contributions depend quadratically , etc .",
    ", on the field strength .",
    "if a structureless neutral particle couples to electrically charged particles , then an electric field can induce an analogous effective dipole moment , despite the fact that the neutral particle is not composed of charged constituents .",
    "many dm candidates do couple to charged particles .",
    "in fact , some indirect searches for dm involve the detection of high energy photons produced in a dm - dm annihilation event .",
    "since the compton amplitude can be related by crossing symmetry to the amplitude for dark - matter annihilation into two photons , then any dark - matter model which gives rise to an indirect detection signal via @xmath5  @xcite can also drive the index of refraction of light from unity .    for a given dm model",
    ", one must compute the forward compton amplitude to determine the particle s contribution to the refractive index ; however , in a low photon - energy expansion , some model independent statements can be made about the amplitude .",
    "if charge conjugation , parity , and time - reversal symmetries are conserved , then the leading order contributions to the forward scattering amplitude are model independent , attributable to the charge , mass , and magnetic dipole moment of the scatterer @xcite .",
    "should these discrete symmetries be violated , then additional contributions to the forward scattering amplitude arise . by including parity- and time - reversal violating terms in the hamiltonian , a more general form for",
    "the scattering amplitude has been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , these new terms are model dependent , and it turns out that only parity violating interactions contribute to the amplitude in the forward limit .",
    "such parity - violating terms can account for permanent electric dipole moments and anapole interactions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered the leading order behavior of the forward compton amplitude and used limits from the non - observation of dispersion attributable to charged matter to place constraints on the charge to mass ratio of sub - ev dark matter particles .",
    "herein , we consider higher order contributions to the index of refraction .",
    "in particular , we compute higher order contributions to the index from millicharged matter , namely its quasi - static polarizability  so called because a charged particle s polarizability diverges in the ( static ) limit of vanishing frequency @xcite .",
    "we also consider two models of neutral dark matter  the boehm - fayet ( bf ) scalar dm model @xcite and the neutralino of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we compute the full forward compton amplitude to first order in perturbation theory for both dm candidates ; this will result in the polarizability of the dm medium . at low photon energies ,",
    "we find that the explicit computations yield the form expected from purely analytic considerations .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of dm have been considered elsewhere .",
    "stringent bounds on the fractional charge of more massive ( mev to gev ) dark matter candidates have been established by requiring that the charge not be so large as to affect the density perturbations at recombination from the cmb spectrum @xcite .",
    "additionally , bounds on the electric and magnetic dipole moments have been established through both theoretical and experimental considerations including dm relic abundance , non - observation of dm - nuclei interactions in direct detection experiments , precision measurements , and non - production at colliders @xcite .",
    "others have determined bounds on the polarizability of dm which sets the scale for the refractive index in the static limit , i.e. , for low photon energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used direct detection searches to limit the polarizability of weakly interacting massive particles with masses on the order of 100 gev . additionally , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors take an effective - field - theory approach to constrain the interaction between dark matter and the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "their constraints on the effective coupling for a photon - dm contact term can be mapped to the polarizability of the dm particle . as for these polarizability constraints ,",
    "the leading order term only sets the scale for the refractive index s deviation from unity because it is independent of omega . to assess , the dispersive nature of the dm medium , higher order contributions to the polarizability",
    "are needed , which we compute below .",
    "for neutral matter , dispersion rather generically depends quadratically upon photon energy . because of collider constraints on the existence of heavy of charged , exotic particles ,",
    "the dispersion due to neutral dm is extremely small , and grb photon arrival time currently provides no meaningful constraints on dm models .",
    "the redshift dependence for time lags due to a dm medium is distinct from those due to liv effects , yet it is possible that matter effects could confound claims of the existence of a modified photon dispersion relation that is quadratic in energy .",
    "herein , we determine the energy scale at which matter effects become comparable in size with such liv effects . as for dispersive matter effects which scale linearly with energy , we find that these arise if there are parity violating terms in the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "these terms can produce a circularly birefringent medium ; that is , the index of refraction is different for right- and left - handed polarized light .",
    "these effects could potentially be confounded with a modified photon dispersion relation which scales linearly with energy , but based upon one model dependent calculation , these matters effects appear to be small .",
    "the relationship between the index of refraction @xmath6 and the coherent forward scattering amplitude @xmath7 for light of frequency @xmath2 and polarization @xmath8 is given by the lorentz relation  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the number density of scatterers , and we work in units of @xmath11 throughout .",
    "the relationship can be derived by considering the transmission of a wave through a thin slab of material at rest  @xcite , where the deviation of @xmath12 from unity arises from the interference between the incident and scattered waves . to relate the completely coherent quantum mechanical forward scattering amplitude , @xmath7 , to the analog in quantum field theory , @xmath13 ,",

    "( [ qft_n ] ) , these terms do not contribute to the index of refraction .",
    "however , we can extend our considerations to include optically active media . in this case , the @xmath32 and @xmath48 terms result in birefringence for circularly polarized light ; that is , the index of refraction , @xmath49 , for postive - helicity photons differs from that , @xmath50 , for negative - helicity photons .",

    "<S> searches for dispersive effects in the propagation of light at cosmological distances have been touted as sensitive probes of lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) and of theories of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> frequency - dependent time lags between simultaneously emitted pulses of light can signal a modification in the photon dispersion relation ; however , matter engenders the cosmos with a dispersive index of refraction to similar effect . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a theoretical framework for the analysis of such effects , contrasting these dispersive terms with those from liv models . </S>",
    "<S> we consider all matter , both luminous and dark . though the only known mode of interaction for dark matter ( dm ) is gravitational </S>",
    "<S> , most models of dark matter also allow for electromagnetic interactions , if only at the one - loop level in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> generically , the leading order dispersive effects due to matter scale with photon energy as @xmath0 for a charged dm candidate and @xmath1 for a neutral dm candidate . </S>",
    "<S> terms linear in @xmath2 can arise in the index of refraction if parity and charge - parity asymmetries are present at the lagrangian or system level . </S>",
    "<S> herein , we compute the index of refraction for a millicharged dark matter candidate at the one - loop level , a neutral scalar dm candidate introduced by boehm and fayet @xcite , and the mssm s neutralino . for a neutral dm candidate </S>",
    "<S> , we determine that matter effects can compete with liv effects that depend quadratically on energy whenever the photon energy is beyond @xmath3 gev , well beyond the gzk cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersive matter effects that scale linearly with @xmath2 are model dependent , and their existence results in circular birefringence . </S>"
