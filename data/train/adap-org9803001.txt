    "in the history of the earth , there have been several catastrophic events which in a short period of time have wiped out large parts of the existing species .",
    "the amount of species annihilated in such events has been up to 96%  of the biodiversity at that time  @xcite .",
    "it has often been argued that these mass extinctions must have been caused by some disastrous abiotic incidences like extraterrestrial impacts .",
    "evidence in favor of that has been put forward  @xcite , but on the other hand , only 5%  of the total loss of biodiversity in the fossil record can be connected to mass extinctions .",
    "the rest are the so - called background extinctions , which happen on much smaller scales .",
    "interestingly , the two types of extinction can not clearly be distinguished from another in the frequency distribution of extinction event sizes .",
    "the event sizes distribution forms a smooth curve , very close to a power - law  @xcite .    in order to explain a single smooth distribution ,",
    "the idea of coevolutionary avalanches has been developed  @xcite .",
    "the extinction of a single species might cause another species to die out , which might drive a third species into extinction and so on , producing an avalanche that in principle could span the whole system .",
    "because of the diverging mean avalanche size , the distribution of extinction events would then be a power - law , similar to the situation of thermodynamical systems at the point of a phase - transition .",
    "nevertheless , this mechanism , called self - organized criticality , completely neglects external influences that certainly are present .    on the contrary , as it has recently been shown",
    ", a power - law distribution of extinction events can appear even in a system in which species are wiped out solely because of external influences  @xcite .",
    "however , this effect depends crucially on influences that are imposed on all species coherently .    from the point of view of a single species it does not really matter whether it has to struggle with bad conditions imposed externally , e.g. , a global shift in temperature , or with bad conditions due to heavy competition with other species .",
    "all that counts for a single species is whether it can keep up with its environment or not .",
    "a species goes extinct when its population decreases to zero .",
    "this can happen for several reasons .",
    "one is a loss of habitat .",
    "climatic or tectonic changes affect the location and the size of a species habitat .",
    "if the size decreases rapidly , the species may not be able to adapt fast enough to find a new niche .",
    "then the population will drop below a level at which it can sustain itself and the species will die out .",
    "another reason for species extinction is the invasion of new competitors or new predators .",
    "competitors that invade a territory may be better adapted to a niche than the species originally occupying this niche . in this case",
    ", the population of the native species can be decimated so effectively that it is wiped out .",
    "the same thing can happen because of an invading predator superior to the defense mechanisms of the species .",
    "similarly , new parasites can significantly reduce the population of a species and drive it to extinction .    from the species point of view",
    ", all the above cases can be subsumed under the notion of stress .",
    "a species suffers stress of various kinds , stress because of climatic changes , stress because of competition and predation etc .",
    "if the stress exceeds the level a species can sustain , it will go extinct .",
    "we are going to develop a model in which all causes for the extinction of a species will be regarded as stress .",
    "every species @xmath0 has a threshold @xmath1 , or in general a vector @xmath2 , against stress .",
    "if a species suffers a stress @xmath3 , or in the general case a vector of stresses @xmath4 , where at least one component exceeds the corresponding component of the threshold vector @xmath2 , it dies out .",
    "so far , this is a very general approach for a model in which species are the smallest units considered , i.e.  a model that does not work with individuals or populations .",
    "clearly , in such a model there will be stress on several scales .",
    "we have global stress like a global shift in temperature due to a slight change in the orbit of the earth around the sun , or the impact of a very large meteor",
    ". then we have stress that spans large parts of the earth , e.g.  a continent or a hemisphere , like the el nio phenomenon that roughly spans the region about the tropical pacific ocean . and",
    "finally , we have stress that affects smaller regions , or only a single species .",
    "this leads us to a hierarchically ordered system of environmental stresses .",
    "the simplest way to model it is to generate stress in a tree structure , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchy ] .",
    "=    on all scales , the stress can be abiotic or biotic .",
    "this may sound a bit counter - intuitive , since abiotic changes are usually taken as large - scale phenomena , and biotic factors are usually taken as local phenomena .",
    "abiotic changes happen often on a global scale , like the above mentioned examples of the orbit shift of the earth or the meteor impact .",
    "but clearly there are more localized events . a small meteor or a small vulcano may affect only a limited number of species . if a species happens to live only in a very small territory , and this territory gets destroyed by a meteor impact",
    ", the species may be the only one that goes extinct because of the impact .",
    "on the other hand , biotic phenomena are not necessarily localized .",
    "although direct species competition will usually be a local phenomenon , there can be also global biotic phenomena .",
    "the composition of the atmosphere , for example , depends strongly on biotic factors , and it can change significantly due to biotic effects .",
    "so far , we have a model which represents the biosphere as a tree , with species situated at the leafs , and environmental stress generated at the nodes .",
    "now we have to choose the rules that determine how stress is generated and what thresholds against stress the species are given .",
    "this is the crucial part where we decide what mechanisms we want to investigate .",
    "if we were interested mainly in coevolutionary effects , we would choose rules that link the properties and actions of the species directly to the generation of the stress .",
    "in such a model , for example , the global stress at time @xmath5 could be some sort of a sum over all the adaptive moves of the species at time @xmath6 . in this work , however , we are mainly interested in the generic features we can expect from the hierarchical structure of the biosphere .",
    "therefore , we will focus on a version of the model where the stresses and the species thresholds are simply random variables .",
    "species interactions and abiotic effects can be so complicated and so unpredictable that in a first approximation we want to assume them to be completely random .",
    "the model we study here is probably the simplest possible .",
    "yet it has some intriguing features which are very similar to characteristics seen in the fossil record . to keep our model simple , we choose a homogenous tree , with @xmath7 layers and @xmath8 subtrees per node .",
    "in general , of course , one has to deal with inhomogenous trees .",
    "to each node of the final layer we connect exactly one leaf , where we put @xmath9 species .",
    "an example of such a tree with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : subtrees ] .",
    "the total number of stresses that have to be generated in one time step is @xmath12 and the total number of species in the model is @xmath13 every species @xmath0 has a single threshold @xmath1 , chosen at random from the uniform distribution on the intervall @xmath14 . at every node @xmath15 ,",
    "the stress @xmath16 generated in one time step is a positive , real random variable drawn from a distribution with probability densitiy function ( pdf ) @xmath17 .",
    "it is a reasonable assumption to expect smaller stresses to happen much more often than larger stresses .",
    "therefore , we use pdf s that fall off relatively fast with @xmath18 .",
    "an exponential or gaussian decrease should be a good choice , but the exact form of the pdf is not really important .",
    "we choose the pdf s @xmath17 at the beginning of the simulation at random from some family of distribution functions and keep this choice fixed throughout the course of the simulation .",
    "finally , we have to fix the way a species is affected by stress generated on different levels of the tree .",
    "we simply take the maximum of all the stress values generated at nodes that lie above the species in the tree : if at any of these nodes a stress @xmath16 is generated which exceeds the species threshold @xmath1 , this species goes extinct .",
    "it is then immediately replaced by a new species with new random threshold .",
    "in addition to the extinction dynamic , we introduce some sort of adaption . in agreement with our idea of a first , simple model ,",
    "the adaption is a random walk : in every time step , a fraction @xmath19 of the species is selected at random and given new thresholds .",
    "there are certainly some oversimplifications in this model , such as the fixed number of species or the fact that all species have only one trait .",
    "we will return to this later and explain why we can still expect to cover the basic features of the extinction dynamic .",
    "the behaviour of the above introduced model can be understood to a large extent from analytical calculations .",
    "but before we begin with our analysis , we note that the mechanism for species extinction and adaption presented here is similar to the one of the so - called coherent - noise models introduced by newman and sneppen  @xcite .",
    "these models display a distribution of extinction events that follows a power - law with exponent @xmath20 , which is in good agreement with the fossil record .",
    "for this reason , they have already been used to study macroevolutionary phenomena  @xcite . the difference to our actual approach lies in the fact that we use a multitude of stresses in a hierarchically ordered system , whereas in the coherent - noise models there is only a single stress , acting on the whole system at once .",
    "therefore , in the previous works the idea of stress imposed on the species has been linked to external influences like meteor impacts and was opposed to coevolutionary effects .    note",
    "that we have effectively a coherent - noise model at every leaf of the tree if the number @xmath9 of species located at one leaf is large .",
    "every leaf of the tree feels a stress - distribution which depends on the distributions of the nodes above it .",
    "let there be @xmath21 nodes above a leaf .",
    "then the @xmath21 stress values having influence on this leaf are @xmath21 random variables @xmath22 with pdf s @xmath23 .",
    "we have to calculate the pdf @xmath24 of the random variable @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 with the partition theorem we can write the probability on the right - hand side as a weighted sum of conditional probabilities : @xmath27 the conditional probabilities read @xmath28 after inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : condprob ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditioning ] ) we find @xmath29 consequently , for the pdf @xmath24 we have @xmath30 we are interested in the tail of @xmath24 . for coherent - noise models we know that a power - law distribution of event - sizes will appear if the stress - distribution @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are positive constants which depend on @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume this condition to hold also for the distributions @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) , with constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "then we can approximate the tail of @xmath24 by @xmath37 we proceed further by taking only linear terms in @xmath38 and obtain @xmath39 for large @xmath40 , this sum will be dominated by the @xmath38 that is falling off slowest .",
    "we say that distribution @xmath38 falls off slower than distribution @xmath17 if there exists a @xmath41 such that @xmath42 for a set of reasonable stress - distributions it is always possible to identify one that is falling off slowest according to this definition .",
    "the fact that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fall_off_slower ] ) will asymptotically be dominated by a single term leads to the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : subtrees ] .",
    "the tree breaks down into several independent subsystems .",
    "the meaning of the numbers in the figure will be explained in detail later . in a nutshell",
    ", they indicate how slow a stress distribution is falling off .",
    "what interests us here is the breakup of the tree into several independent parts in the regime of large stresses .",
    "if these parts are not too small , they will behave like independent coherent - noise systems .",
    "=      if the stress - distributions close to the root dominate the behaviour of the system , the tree will break down into independent coherent - noise systems , as we have mentioned above .",
    "consequently , we proceed with the calculation of the distribution of extinction events in a system consisting of independent coherent - noise subsystems . in the calculation , however , we will deviate slightly from the actual situation in the tree model by assuming the subsystems to have each an infinite size .",
    "this allows for an easy calculation , and the main results should also hold for large but finite sizes .    in the case of an infinite system size",
    ", the event distribution of a coherent - noise model possesses a power - law tail that extends to arbitrary large events .",
    "therefore , the task of calculating the event distribution of the compound system equals to the task of calculating the sum of a finite number of nonidentically distributed random variables with power - law tail .",
    "the latter can be treated mathematically exact under relatively weak assumptions  @xcite .",
    "but since the exact calculations are too extensive to be included in this work , we will here give only an intuitive argument about the tail behaviour of the sum .",
    "we begin with the sum of two positive , real random variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where the pdf s @xmath45 and @xmath46 have a power - law tail @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we assume the pdf s to be continuous , non - singular , and reasonably smooth .",
    "under these conditions , we can write @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are continuous , non - singular , and reasonably smooth functions which tend towards a positive constant for @xmath52 . the pdf @xmath53 of the sum @xmath54 is the convolution of @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath55 after a change of the integration variable to @xmath56 we obtain @xmath57 for large @xmath40 , there are two main contributions to this integral , at @xmath58 and at @xmath59 , which stem from the first and from the second term in the denominator .",
    "since the denominators will become arbitrarily large for large @xmath40 , we can assume the other terms to be constant in the regions where the main contributions come from .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath60\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are positive constants .",
    "obviously for large @xmath40 the term with the largest exponent will dominate .",
    "hence we have @xmath63 this result can be easily extended to the case of an arbitrary finite number of random variables with power - law tail by iteration .",
    "asymptotically , the tail of @xmath64 will always be dominated by the contribution from the term with the smallest exponent .    back to the ensemble of infinitely large coherent - noise systems",
    ", we find that it will display power - law distributed event sizes , as its single constituents do .",
    "if the subsystems stress - distributions are functionally different , the exponent of the compound system s event distribution will be the smallest of the subsystems exponents .",
    "the above result should also hold in the situation of finite coherent noise systems , as long as their total number is small compared to their typical size .",
    "we argue above that in the limit of large stresses the tree will break down into subsystems , virtually independent of each other .",
    "the behaviour of our model depends heavily on the size of the parts we find .",
    "if the different parts are all very small , the system will loose its coherent - noise characteristics . instead of a power - law distribution the extinction events",
    "will then follow a gaussian distribution because of the central - limit theorem . therefore ,",
    "in this section we will study the distribution of the subsystems sizes that arises if we randomly assign stress distributions to the tree s nodes .",
    "we assume that the propability for a certain stress distribution to be assigned to a certain node does not depend on the position of the node in the tree .",
    "in other words , we use the same set of stress distributions on all levels of the tree .",
    "furthermore , we assume that for any two stress distributions we use we can identify one of the two that falls off faster than the other one . under these conditions , we can study the structure of such trees by simply assigning integers to the nodes of the tree , where larger integers stand for distributions that are falling off slower .",
    "if the set of possible stress distributions is infinite , the probability of finding two nodes with the same distribution is zero .",
    "consequently , in a tree with @xmath8 nodes , we will assign every integer from @xmath65 to exactly one node .",
    "this is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : subtrees ] for a tree with 15 nodes .",
    "for every leaf @xmath0 of the tree we can then define a characteristic number @xmath66 .",
    "this number is the maximum of the nodes numbers encountered on the way from the leaf up to the root .",
    "all the leafs with the same characteristic number belong to the same subsystem . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : subtrees ] , we have five subsystems in total .",
    "three of them contain only one leaf , one contains two and one contains three leafs .    in general",
    ", we are interested in the distribution of subsystems arising in large trees .",
    "therefore , we have done simulations in which we have several thousand times assigned random integers to the nodes of a large tree . for every single realization of the tree , we have computed a histogram of the frequency of the different parts sizes .",
    "finally , we have calculated the average of all the histograms .",
    "[ fig : parts ] shows the result of such simulations for two different trees with 10000 histograms each .",
    "we find the expected frequency @xmath67 of large independent parts in the tree decreasing as a sawtooth function that follows approximately a power - law with exponent  @xmath68 , independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the sharp peaks in the distribution arise whenever the size of a complete subtree is reached .",
    "therefore , we observe in fig .  [",
    "fig : parts ] , e.g. , the peaks in the distribution of the tree with @xmath69 appearing at powers of 10 .",
    "the power - law can be explained easily if we assume the main contributions to come from complete subtrees .",
    "the expected frequency @xmath67 to find an independent subtree with @xmath70 layers , which corresponds to a subsystem of size @xmath71 , can be written as the number of such subtrees in the whole system , @xmath72 , times the probability that any of these subtrees will be independent of the rest , @xmath73 .",
    "hence we write @xmath74 the number of subtrees of size @xmath75 is @xmath76 . for the probability @xmath73",
    "we find @xmath77 which is simply the probability for the integer assigned to the node at the root of the subtree to be larger than all the other integers which are assigned to the remaining nodes of the subtree and to the nodes above the subtree .",
    "if we increase @xmath70 by one , we get @xmath78 . with slightly more effort , we find also @xmath79 therefore , we can write @xmath80 which implies @xmath81 .    the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ] appear whenever the size of a complete subtree is reached , as we have noted above .",
    "this means they are connected to the extremely regular structure of the trees we use in this work .",
    "therefore , we are currently investigating trees with irregular structure . for these trees ,",
    "the spikes disappear and , in log - log plot , the function @xmath67 becomes almost a straight line with slope -2 . from the simulations we have done so far , we can say that this result is very general and seems to be independent of the special trees properties .    =",
    "since we are interested in the typical behaviour of our model , we have to do many simulation runs with different tree sizes and different stress distributions at the tree s nodes . but",
    "the simulation of large trees is very slow , and therefore it is hard to get a good sample of the parameter - space . to overcome this difficulty we have also done simulations based on the arguments of the previous sections .",
    "as we have seen there , in the limit of large stresses it is possible to map the leafs of the tree onto a system consisting of several independent coherent - noise models , with the sizes @xmath82 of these subsystems distributed according to @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we show a comparison between the full simulation and the approximation . to come as close as possible to the full simulation",
    ", we use the maximum of 5 independent , exponentially distributed random variables as stresses for the independent coherent - noise models , since for the tree we have likewise chosen @xmath84 and exponential stress - distributions .",
    "clearly the behaviour of the approximation is close to the one of the full simulation , which verifies the analytical reasoning of the previous sections .",
    "both simulations display power - law distributed extinction events . for the full tree , we find an exponent @xmath85 , while for the approximation , we find @xmath86 .",
    "if we consider the high level of abstraction from the tree to an ensemble of coherent - noise systems , this agreement is excellent .",
    "note that in comparison to a normal coherent - noise model with only a single stress variable , the tree model produces a significantly larger exponent @xmath87 ( if we run a normal coherent - noise model with the stress distribution of the approximaton in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , we get an exponent @xmath88 ) . the increased exponent @xmath87 has its origin in the distribution of the subsystems sizes .",
    "the sizes scale themselves , thus modifying the scale - invariant behavior of the ensemble , compared to the one of a single coherent - noise system .",
    "we have presented a model of large - scale evolution and extinction that combines biotic and abiotic causes for extinction within a single mathematical framework .",
    "furthermore , the model takes into account the hierarchical structure of the biosphere . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the implications of environmental changes happening on different scales have not been studied previously in macroevolutionary models . despite the choice of completely random environmental changes , the model has some interesting features .",
    "the distribution of extinction events follows a power - law with exponent in the region of 2 ( note that the exponent depends on the choice of the stress distribution , as it is the case with coherent - noise models ) . from the fossil record , a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath89 is reported for the extinction event sizes of taxonomical families @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to observe the breakup of the tree into subsystems with sizes @xmath82 distributed according to @xmath83 .",
    "the power - law distribution of the subsytem sizes implies that even in very large trees we will find large subsystems , governed mainly by only a single stress distribution .",
    "intuitively , we would expect the subsystems to have roughly similar sizes , and to enter the dynamic of the whole system on an equal basis .",
    "but we observe exactly the opposite .",
    "the subsystems sizes are scale - invariant , thus producing a scale - invariant distribution of contributions to the overall system s behavior .",
    "in particular , only a small number of large subsystems produces events on large scales .",
    "this might be an explanation for the fact that in such large and complex systems like the biosphere we find usually smooth frequency distributions of typical objects or events .",
    "the model we have studied in this work is certainly oversimplified .",
    "for that reason , we will close this paper with some remarks about extensions to the model that should be examined in a next step closer to biological reality .",
    "first of all , it is certainly a severe restriction to keep the number of species fixed throughout the simulation .",
    "nevertheless , this is a restriction used very often in models of macroevolution  @xcite . only recently",
    ", work has been done where a change in biodiversity is considered  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the model we study here is governed by the coherent - noise dynamic . for this",
    "dynamic , it has been shown that it can be generalized to include a variable system size without loss of it s main features  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe a fixed system - size can be justified in the present work . it should be possible to extend our tree model to a model with variable system size .",
    "another severe restriction is the usage of only one trait .",
    "but here a similar argument holds as in the case of the fixed number of species .",
    "a multi - trait version of the original coherent - noise model has already been studied  @xcite .",
    "it behaves very similar to the single - trait version .",
    "finally , we want to discuss the way we compute the stress on a single species out of the multitude of stress values , generated at the different levels of the tree . throughout this paper",
    ", we have used the maximum of the stress values .",
    "this allows for an easy and very general analytical investigation .",
    "another natural choice , however , would be to sum up all the stresses .",
    "we have also done some simulations in this fashion .",
    "the behavior of the system remains roughly the same .",
    "this happens because in a finite sum of non - identically distributed random variables , we expect large values to be dominated by a single term of the sum , similar to the case of the maximum of several random variables",
    ". for the sum of exponentially distributed random variables , an easy calculation shows that this conjecture is indeed true . with some more effort",
    ", we can prove the same for the sum of power - law distributed random variables , as we have already done in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , in the general case with arbitrary distributions , the conjecture is hard to demonstrate ."
