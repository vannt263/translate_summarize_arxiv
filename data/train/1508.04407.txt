    "[ fig : parameter_dependence]a , b ) , it is advantageous to use an objective with a highest possible @xmath124 . larger period of the lattice potential may also be helpful . although the fitted values of the exciton temperature @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammafit ] , inset ) are in agreement with those from earlier studies ,  @xcite the accuracy of the method can be further improved if @xmath78 is known independently .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the exciton pl after a pulsed excitation in a time interval of the order of a few nanoseconds after the excitation pulse . under such conditions , the ixs cool down and their temperature approaches the bath temperature .",
    "@xcite using a defocused laser excitation spot to create an ix cloud with a more uniform density may also be beneficial .",
    "such improvements of the proposed method is a subject for future experiments .    on the theory side , better understanding of the disorder effects on the exciton pl",

    "we confine ourselves to the following brief discussion . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , efficient loading of excitons into the lattice requires working with systems where the blue shift @xmath198 is higher than the characteristic energy scale of the disorder . in this case the interaction of excitons with random potential of disorder can be treated perturbatively .",
    "thus , we can use the linear - response ( effective ) dielectric function @xmath199 to determine how the exciton gas screens this random potential .",
    "the zero-@xmath119 limit of @xmath199 is given by eqs .   and",
    ", while its large-@xmath119 behavior can be shown to be of the form  @xcite @xmath200 . since @xmath87 depends on @xmath6 , so does the disorder - induced self - energy correction @xmath201 . assuming the bare random potential is a white noise of bare strength @xmath202 , we use the first born approximation to get @xmath203 \\\\ & \\simeq -i \\gamma + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi}\\ , \\ln \\left(\\frac{2 e n t}{\\omega - \\bar\\varepsilon_0}\\right ) \\",
    ", , \\quad \\gamma \\equiv \\bar\\nu_1 v_d\\ , .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eqn : sigma_ba}\\ ] ] the next improvement is the self - consistent born approximation ,  @xcite which is obtained replacing @xmath42 in the logarithm with its renormalized value @xmath106 . for @xmath204 , the energies @xmath79 relevant for the pl are @xmath205 .",
    "the corresponding real part of the self - energy is @xmath206 using the definition   of @xmath36 and replacing @xmath91 by @xmath198 , we find that the random potential creates a fractional correction @xmath207 to the correlation parameter @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath208@xmath209 in fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation_fits](a ) and ( b ) , this correction can be as high as @xmath210 assuming @xmath211 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : phases ] and [ fig : gammafit ] ) .    finally , we wish to point out that our method of determining the correlation parameter of an interacting gas is quite general .",
    "similar techniques can be applied for a variety of other systems that can be subjected to lattice potentials and whose spatially modulated parameters can be measured .",
    "examples include cold atomic clouds ,  @xcite exciton polariton systems ,  @xcite and two - dimensional electron layers .",
    "@xcite     obtained from fitting the experimental data for both energy and intensity modulation curves in figs .",
