    "the famous no - go theorem @xcite states that lattice fermion actions with chiral symmetry , locality and other common features must produce massless degrees of freedom in multiples of two in a continuum limit .",

    "domain - wall @xcite and overlap fermions @xcite produce a single fermion mode by modifying the definition of chiral symmetry or introducing the momentum - dependent chiral charge , although they lead to rather expensive simulations algorithms .. these approaches attempt to realize single fermionic degrees of freedom by breaking the requisite conditions for the no - go theorem . on the other hand , there is another direction to approach numerical simulations . according to @xcite ,",
    "hypercubic symmetry and reflection positivity of actions result in @xmath2 species of fermions where @xmath3 stands for the dimension .",

    "actually , the staggered fermion approach @xcite , with only 4 species of fermions does this and possesses flavored - hypercubic symmetry instead .",
    "however this requires rooting procedures for the physical @xmath4 or @xmath5-flavor qcd simulation .",
    "a possible goal in this direction is a lattice fermion with @xmath4 species , the minimal number required by the no - go theorem .",
    "such a minimal - doubling action was first proposed by karsten , and later by wilczek @xcite .",

    "these fermions all possess one exact chiral symmetry and ultra locality . as such they could be faster for simulation , at least for two - flavor qcd , than other chirally symmetric lattice fermions .",
    "however it has been shown @xcite that we need to fine - tune several parameters for a continuum limit with these actions .",

    "we pursue the chiral phase structure in the parameter plane for minimal - doubling lattice qcd for two purposes : one purpose is to understand properties of these formulations theoretically .",
    "the other purpose is to show their applicability to lattice qcd simulations since understanding a nontrivial phase diagram , as with the aoki phase in wilson fermion @xcite , can be useful in showing the applicability to lattice qcd .",

    "we multiply @xmath18 by @xmath19 or @xmath20 as @xmath21 in these cases , degeneracy of species is lifted by specie - dependent real or imaginary chemical potential terms , not by species - dependent mass .",
    "it means that we can get rid of some doublers by this method too .",

    "( we will later discuss problems with this kind of naive introduction of chemical potential @xcite . )",

    "the parameter @xmath0 is of special importance : it changes the number of flavors and plays an important role in the chiral phase structure .",
    "furthermore the quantum effects produce @xmath9 additive chemical potential renormalization in this case instead the additive mass renormalization , and we need to cancel it by adjusting @xmath0 even for the application to the imaginary - chemical - potential lattice qcd .",
    "this necessity of parameter tuning is also understood from the well - known fact that the naive introduction of chemical potential into lattice fermions leads to divergence of energy density and requires a counterterm due to the violation of the abelian gauge invariance as shown in ref .",
