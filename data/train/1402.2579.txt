    "@xcite , in which the existence of nonlinear da waves in unmagnetized dusty plasmas ( where the charged dusts provide the inertia and the restoring forces come from the pressures of inertialess electrons and ions ) was first predicted , there has been a number of works focusing on the linear or nonlinear properties of low - frequency da waves in magnetized or unmagnetized plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the nonlinear propagation of such waves can give rise to the formation of solitons with negative or positive wave amplitudes , which has potential applications in astrophysical and space environments ( such as cometary tails , planetary rings , interstellar clouds and lower parts of earth s ionosphere etc . ) as well as in laboratory and technological studies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , electrostatic solitary waves have been observed in several regions , including the earth s magnetotail , bow shock / solar wind , and polar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the observations in space plasma environments indicate the presence of electrons and ions which are not in thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the presence of nonthermal electrons in earth s bow - shock region has been confirmed by the vela satellite @xcite .",
    "also , the aspera on the phobos 2 satellite has recorded the loss of energetic electrons from the upper ionosphere of mars .",
    "furthermore , observations made by the viking spacecraft and freja satellite have indicated the presence of electrostatic solitary structures in the magnetosphere with density depressions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by numerical simulation that the propagation of da waves can give rise to a significant amount of ion trapping in the wave potential @xcite .",
    "@xcite had demonstrated that the nonlinear ion - hole instability is the best candidate for the generation mechanism of the negative isolated potentials .",
    "naturally , there is a departure from the boltzmann distribution and one thus encounters a vortex - like ion distribution in phase space .",
    "the nonthermal distribution of electrons with an excess of energetic particles can be modelled by the cairns distribution @xcite , while the distribution of free as well as trapped particles can be considered as prescribed by schamel @xcite .",
    "the important effects of the external magnetic field @xcite as well as the nonthermal electrons @xcite and trapped ions with vortex - like distribution @xcite on the properties of electrostatic da waves have been studied in magnetized or unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "some analytical studies on the nonlinear propagation of da waves in unmagnetized plasmas @xcite as well as plasmas with vortex - like ions @xcite have also been reported . using variable separation approach , lin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had investigated the nonlinear features of da solitary waves with dust charge fluctuation .",
    "furthermore , the properties of solitary waves and shocks ( sws ) have been studied in other environments , e.g. , dense quantum plasmas to show that quantum parameter plays an important role in the formation of compressive or rarefactive sws @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the dusty plasmas consisting of vortex - like ions and nonisothermal electrons , both for the first- and second - order perturbed potentials , support only rarefactive solitons .",
    "it was pointed out that the higher - order approximation enhances the amplitude of the da waves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear propagation of da waves has been investigated in unmagnetized dusty plasmas consisting of boltzmannian @xcite or nonthermal @xcite electrons and vortex - like ions .",
    "however , no theory has been reported so far for the oblique propagation of da waves in a magnetized dusty plasma with nonthermal electrons and trapped ions .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic da waves in a magnetized dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged dust fluid , non - thermal fast electrons and trapped ions with vortex - like distribution .",
    "we use the reductive perturbation technique ( rpt ) to derive a kdv - like equation which has nonlinearity proportional to three - half power of the wave potential .",
    "it is shown that solitary waves may propagate as stationay solitons of the rarefactive type .",
    "the properties of the soliton as well as its dynamical evolution are analyzed with the system parameters .",
    "the results should be useful for understanding the nonlinear features of localized electrostatic perturbations in laboratory and space plasmas ( e.g. , earth s magnetosphere , auroral region , heliospheric environments ) in which magnetized negatively charged dusts , nonthermal electrons and trapped ions are the major plasma species .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of da waves in a magnetized dusty plasma consisting of very massive , micrometer - sized , negatively charged inertial dust grains , nonthermally distributed fast electrons , and ions with trapped particles .",
    "the external static magnetic field is considered along the @xmath5-axis , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the nonlinear dynamics of the low - phase velocity ( in comparison with the electron and ion thermal velocities , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the thermal velocity of @xmath9-species particles with @xmath10 for electrons , ions and charged dusts ) , low - frequency ( in comparison with the dust - cyclotron frequency ) da waves is given by the following set of normalized equations : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the number density and velocity of charged dusts ( with mass @xmath16 ) normalized by the unperturbed value @xmath17 and the da speed @xmath18 , with @xmath19 denoting the electron temperature , @xmath20 the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 the charged dust state , i , e . , the number of electrons / ions residing on the dust - grain surface .",
    "also , @xmath22 is the electrostatic wave potential normalized by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the dust temperature , @xmath27 is the dust - cyclotron frequency normalized by the dust plasma oscillation frequency @xmath28 . the time and space variables are , respectively , in the units of the dust plasma period @xmath29 and the debye length @xmath30 . at equilibrium",
    ", the charge neutrality condition reads @xmath31 . for the propagation of da waves since the thermal motion of charged dusts can not keep up with the wave , we consider adiabatic compression of the dust fluid , and use the pressure law : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 for three - dimensional configuration . in this assumption ,",
    "the effects of viscosity , thermal conductivity and the energy transfer due to collisions can be neglected . in our fluid model",
    "we have also considered the plasma thermal pressure to be smaller than the magnetic pressure and the charging of the dust grains is held constant .    in",
    "what follows , the nonthermal distribution of electrons ( fast or energetic particles ) are given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , denotes the degree of nonthermality of the charged particles ( percentage of fast or energetic electrons ) in the plasma , and @xmath38 according to when @xmath39 .",
    "the value @xmath40 corresponds to the case of thermal equilibrium ( boltzmann distribution ) of electrons .    on the other hand",
    ", the ion distribution with free and trapped particles is modelled for small - amplitude perturbations ( @xmath41 ) as @xcite @xmath42 note that this expression for @xmath43 ( which becomes the same for @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the small - amplitude limit ) is obtained after integrating the ion distribution functions over the velocity space @xmath46 for free @xmath47 and trapped @xmath48 particles which solve the corresponding vlasov equation .",
    "the distribution functions are @xcite @xmath49,~|v|>\\sqrt{-2\\phi } ,   \\\\ f_{it}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\left(v^2 + 2\\phi\\right)\\right],~|v|\\leq\\sqrt{-2\\phi } , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the ratio of the free to trapped ion temperatures and determines the densities of trapped ions . from a qualitative plot of these distribution functions",
    ", it can be seen that the negative values @xmath51 of the temperature ratio @xmath4 correspond to an excavated vortex particle distribution , i.e. , a depression in the trapped particle distribution , while @xmath52 represents the plateau ( flat - topped ) .",
    "it has been shown that the negative values of the trapping parameter @xmath4 may lead to the generation of ion holes @xcite and solitary phase - space holes @xcite in plasmas .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of @xmath53 , @xmath54 approaches the boltzmann distribution .",
    "thus , one can consider either @xmath44 or @xmath55 .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the wave steepening parameter is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "so , when @xmath57 , i.e. , the influence of the trapped ions is inverted or when the number of trapped ions is increased , there may exist a more steepened wave , and because of the more peaked bump of the ion distribution , a stability analysis would exhibit the unstable nature of these waves .",
    "thus , waves with @xmath57 may be physically unrealistic .    next ,",
    "for the dynamical evolution of the small - amplitude electrostatic da perturbations we follow the same rpt as in refs .",
    "note that the reductive perturbation method is a very powerful way of deriving nonlinear evolution equations in simplified forms for the propagation of different kind of waves and their interactions in various nonlinear media .",
    "the method has been well applied not in plasma or fluid media , but also in other nonlinear media , e.g. , in a liquid with gas bubbles to study the characteristic features of nonlinear waves @xcite . for the description of rpt and their applications readers",
    "are referred to the work of leblond @xcite .",
    "thus , the independent variables are stretched as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a small parameter measuring the weakness of the wave amplitude , @xmath60 is the nonlinear wave phase velocity normalized by the da speed @xmath61 . also , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the direction cosines of the wave vector along the axes such that @xmath64 . the dependent variables , namely @xmath65 and @xmath22 are expanded as @xmath66 in the above expansions , the first - order perturbations for the transverse velocity components of the dust fluids appear in higher - orders of @xmath67 than that for the parallel component .",
    "for the nonlinear da waves , this anisotropy is introduced due to the fact that the dust gyromotion ( perpendicular to the magnetic field ) is treated as a higher - order effect than the motion parallel to the magnetic field @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we substitute eqs . and into eqs .",

    "must be positive , which gives @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that in hot dusty plasmas , the small - amplitude da wave propagation is possible when the percentage of energetic electrons ( or the degree of nonthermality ) exceeds some critical value and is higher than the nonenergetic ones .",
    "however , in cold dusty plasmas ( @xmath96 ) , the same can propagate with @xmath97 irrespective of the polarity ( positive or negative ) of the charged dusts .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( 16 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the phase velocity @xmath94 is not only influenced by the effects of the number density of charged particles and the nonthermality of electrons , but also greatly modified by the effects of the dust temperature @xmath98 as well as the obliqueness of propagation ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "typical variations of the phase velocity @xmath94 with respect to the density ratio @xmath99 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ( see the left panel ) for different values of @xmath63 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "it approaches a constant value at higher values of @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath94 increases ( decreases ) with increasing ( decreasing ) values of the parameters @xmath63 ( obliqueness of the angle of propagation ) , the nonthermal parameter @xmath104 and the temperature ratio @xmath105 . from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , which shows the variation of @xmath106 with respect to @xmath99 , one can conclude that the larger the values of the dust temperature , the smaller is the percentage of fast electrons to be required to excite the electrostatic da waves .",
    "next , from eqs .",
    "and we obtain @xmath107 substituting the expressions for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 from eqs . , and into eq . ,",
    "and noting that the coefficient of @xmath111 vanishes by the dispersion relation , we obtain , after a few steps , the following kdv - like equation @xmath112 where the coefficients of nonlinearity and dispersion are @xmath113[3 + 5t(1+\\delta(2-\\beta ) ) ] } , a=\\frac{1-\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\frac{\\mu l^2_{z}}{v_0[\\mu+\\delta(1-\\beta)]^2},\\ ] ] @xmath114\\left(5t-3v_{0}^{2}\\right)}{\\omega_{c}^{2}\\left[\\mu+\\delta(1-\\beta)\\right]}\\notag\\\\ & & + \\frac{l^2_z}{2v_0\\left[\\mu+\\delta(1-\\beta)\\right]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath115 for negatively / positively charged dusts .",
    "we note that in contrast to the usual kdv equation appeared in various contexts of plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , eq . has a nonlinear term proportional to the three - half power of the wave potential .",
    "this modification of the nonlinear term is , however , due to the consideration of vortex - like ion distribution in the plasma .",

    "we note that both the coefficients @xmath116 and @xmath117 are modified by the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath100 , @xmath99 and @xmath101 , while the effects of the trapped ions characterized by @xmath4 and the static magnetic field characterized by @xmath118 are , respectively , entered in @xmath116 and @xmath117 only .",
    "it should be mentioned that the negative sign in @xmath119 in the nonlinear term of eq . , which appears due to the vortex - like distribution of the positively charged particles , i.e. , ions @xcite does not appear in a recent work @xcite on da waves in an unmagnetized plasma with mobile dusts , nonthermal electrons and trapped positive ions .",
    "furthermore , in ref . @xcite it has been shown that the da soliton exists only of the compressive type with a form of sech@xmath120 as the kdv soliton .",

    "we find that in contrast to the usual kdv soliton ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the amplitude of the soliton [ eq . ] does not depend on the sign of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath116 .",

    "it is seen that in contrast to the kdv soliton ( in which the wave steepening occurs @xcite ) , the leading part of the initial pulse flattens due to the modified nonlinearity ( proportional to the three - half power of the wave potential ) .",
    "as the time progresses , the pulse separates into solitons that are down - shifted and a residue due to the wave dispersion .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](d ) that once the solitons are formed and get separated , they propagate almost without changing their shape due to the balance of the nonlinearity and the wave dispersion . from figs .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] and [ fig : figure4 ] , one can conclude that the da solitons can withstand perturbations and turbulence in a finite interval of time .",
    "it is to be mentioned that the time evolution of the kdv equation as well as the stability / instability of its solitary solution can also be studied by some other methods , e.g. , semi - analytical methods @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the propagation characteristics of electrostatic dust - acoustic waves in a magnetized dusty plasma with the combined effects of the nonthermal electrons and trapped ions with vortex - like distribution . by using the reductive perturbation technique , a kdv - like equation with a nonlinearity proportional to three - half power of the wave potential",
    "is derived to investigate the nonlinear propagation of da solitary waves .",
    "it is found that the da wave propagation is possible when the percentage of energetic electrons remains higher than the slow counterparts , i.e. , the degree of nonthermality @xmath182 and exceeds its critical value @xmath106 . the latter changes with the number densities of the particles as well as the thermal pressure of charged dusts . in absence of the dust thermal pressure , i.e. , in cold dusty magnetoplasmas , da solitary wave can propagate with @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the stationary soliton solution of the kdv - like equation , in the form of @xmath183 ( quite distinctive from the kdv soliton ) , is obtained and its properties are studied with the system parameters .",
    "it is shown that the external magnetic field characterized by @xmath118 ( the parameter @xmath4 for trapped ions ) does not have any influence on the amplitude ( width ) , but on the width ( amplitude ) of the soliton .",
    "thus , the external magnetic field causes the solitary structures to become more spiky , while the soliton amplitude decreases ( increases ) with @xmath44 @xmath184 .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical evolution of the da solitary waves shows that the da soliton can withstand perturbations and turbulence during a considerable time .",
    "our numerical results show that a decrease of the obliqueness parameter @xmath63 , the ratio of dust to electron temperature @xmath100 , as well as the ratio of the free to trapped ion temperature @xmath173 ( @xmath44 ) favors the instability of the da solitons , while the similar instability can be achieved by an increase of the ratio of electron to dust charge density @xmath145 . to conclude",
    ", the theoretical results should be useful for understanding the nonlinear features of electrostatic dust - acoustic solitary waves that propagate obliquely to the magnetic field in nonthermal plasmas with higher percentage of energetic ( fast ) electrons and trapped ions in laboratories as well as space plasmas ( e.g. , earth s magnetosphere , auroral region , heliospheric environments etc . ) .",
