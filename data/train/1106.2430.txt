    "in the emerging field of nanoscale science , major efforts have been devoted to form a deep , predictive understanding of the mechanisms involved in fundamental tribological processes , envisaging alternative innovative solutions to control friction @xcite .",
    "the ability to manipulate frictional forces is extremely important for many technological applications .",
    "one may wish to reduce or enhance friction , eliminate the high - dissipative chaotic and stick - slip regimes of motion , and instead , to achieve smooth sliding .",
    "early stages of motion and stopping processes in micromechanical devices and computer disk drives , which exhibit chaotic stick - slip , pose , for example , a real problem .",
    "the difficulties in realizing an efficient control of friction are related to the complexity of the task , namely dealing with systems with many degrees of freedom under a strict size interfacial confinement .",
    "the achievements of nanotechnology have opened new perspectives and new basic scientific questions in this direction , where novel local probes give access to the study of friction at the atomic level .",
    "a novel approach for tuning frictional response , which has recently attracted considerable interest @xcite , is the mechanical control of a system , via externally imposed normal or lateral vibrations of small amplitude and energy to the sliding interface .",
    "manipulations by mechanical excitations , when applied at suitable frequencies and amplitudes , can drive particles , which are close to the interface , out of their potential energy minima , thus increasing considerably surface diffusion and mobility , and reducing friction . through the dynamical stabilization of desirable regimes of motion ( e.g. , smooth sliding ) , which would be otherwise unstable , substrate",
    "mechanical oscillations can reduce high dissipative sliding behaviors ( stick - slip ) .    since the idea is not to change the physical properties of mating interfaces , flexibility and accessibility are main relevant features of this approach . controlling frictional forces has been traditionally approached by chemical means @xcite , usually by supplementing base lubricants with friction modifying additives .",
    "however , standard lubrication techniques provide prescribed tribological properties which fit a certain range of parameters of the sliding objects ( such as the load ) and the external forcing , and are expected to be less effective at the nanoscales . here , on the contrary",
    ", frictional properties can be tuned continuously by the frequency and the amplitude of the out - of - plane or in - plane vibrations of the sliding surfaces .",
    "the predicted effects should be amenable to atomic force microscopy ( afm ) tests @xcite or applying ultrasound to the sample @xcite , or even in studies of contact mechanics of a probe interacting with oscillating quartz crystal microbalance surfaces @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the recent results @xcite concerning the ability to modify tribological properties at the nanoscale by subjecting a substrate to lateral mechanical oscillations .",
    "the investigation is limited to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) tomlinson - like model .",
    "we show that microscopic friction can be suitably tuned and reduced by controlling the resonant frequencies and amplitudes of the imposed substrate lateral excitations .",
    "depending on the model parameters , the numerical simulations reveal the details of the observed different regimes of motion ( smooth sliding , stick - slip , inverted stick - slip ) and of the occurring transitions among them .",
    "moreover we show that for particular sets of parameters values the motion can be sustained just with the oscillations .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , it has been frequently shown that , despite the simplified level of description , phenomenological models of friction have revealed the ability of mimicking the main features of the tribological behavior observed both in nanoscale experiments or in more complex md simulation frameworks @xcite .",
    "the _ prandtl - tomlinson model _ is , probably , the most widely used in interpretation of tribological experiments due to its simplicity and its ability of accounting for the main physical features of atomic - scale friction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this mathematical description ,",
    "a particle of mass @xmath0 is coupled , via a harmonic spring of stiffness @xmath1 , to a moving stage which slides at constant velocity @xmath2 . moreover , the particle experiences a periodic ( sinusoidal ) coupling @xmath3 to the substrate , where @xmath4 is the current position of the particle .",
    "introducing the viscous damping coefficient @xmath5 , which results from the energy dissipation to phonons or other excitations in the substrate , the equation of motion for the particle becomes @xmath6 if the pulling spring is stiff enough ( i.e. , @xmath1 is larger than the effective substrate spring constant @xmath7 $ ] ) , then there is always a unique equilibrium position @xmath8 for the particle .",
    "consequently , at small driving velocity , the friction will be linear in @xmath2 .",
    "things become more interesting once @xmath9 exceeds @xmath1 . in this situation ,",
    "the potential energy landscape experienced by the particle is characterized , at certain instances of time , by more than one stable position .",
    "the time dependence of the combined spring and substrate potential reveals that mechanically stable positions disappear at certain instances in time due to the motion of the spring .",
    "the system is locked in one of the minima of the potential energy landscape until the increasing elastic stress of the spring allows overcoming the barrier .",
    "after that , the slider is accelerated .",
    "the potential energy of the elastic stress is converted into the kinetic energy of the slip event and , eventually , dissipated into heat via the damping @xmath5-term .",
    "then , the particle rapidly drops to the next nearest metastable minimum , where it locks again . as a consequence , for sufficiently small driving velocity",
    ", the dissipated energy per sliding distance is rather independent of @xmath2 , in agreement with many experimental results .",
    "obviously , this simple mechanical description can provide only qualitative interpretations of the underlying tribological processes .",
    "the tomlinson model is described in detail in many surveys , e.g. , in refs.@xcite , with a long list of applications to concrete physical systems ( in particular to those concerning tip - based devices ) .    in this work",
    "we consider a tomlinson - like model as that recently introduced in ref .",
    "in particular , in order to study the effect of lateral vibrations on 1d diffusion and friction , the model describes the diffusion and driven dynamics of an afm tip ( a single mass driven by an external guide ) subject to a substrate , which oscillates in the lateral direction with amplitude @xmath10 and frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the potential of such oscillating substrate becomes @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{acsubstrate}\\ ] ]    the motion of the tip in lateral direction is governed by the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the force due to the substrate potential @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 represents the velocity at which the substrate oscillates .",
    "in particular , the last two terms take into account the thermal and dissipation effects in the framework of the langevin dynamics @xcite . the random force @xmath18 and the viscous damping term @xmath5",
    "are related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoting the boltzmann constant and the temperature respectively .",
    "these two added terms can be thought of as representing degrees of freedom inherent in a real physical system which are not explicitly included in the adopted simplified mathematical description . in particular , we assume that the damping term in eq .",
    "( [ our_model ] ) is determined by the energy dissipation to phonons and electron - hole excitations in the substrate . as a result ,",
    "this term is proportional to the relative velocity of the driven tip and the substrate . under these conditions ,",
    "the substrate vibrations cause a time - periodic ( ac ) force acting on the tip , @xmath22 .",
    "this force presents the effect of inertia .    in the strong ( weak )",
    "dissipative regime , when @xmath5 is much larger ( smaller ) than the characteristic vibrational frequencies of the system , the motion is overdamped ( underdamped ) .",
    "the numerical integration is carried out using the well - known velocity verlet algorithm .",
    "for every value of the parameters and after reaching the steady state , the system characteristics of relevant physical interest are measured .",
    "natural units used to characterize the model for length , time and energy are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . if not stated differently , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 define our default parameter values . for parameters close to these default values ,",
    "the system can be considered to behave as overdamped . under these parameter ranges , the predicted effects , as for surface diffusion resonance frequencies",
    ", should be amenable , e.g. , to atomic force microscopy ( afm ) tests using shear modulation mode , for which we typically have @xmath32 kg , @xmath33 ev , and @xmath34 nm . for these values of system parameters , the characteristic frequency turns out to be @xmath35 @xmath36s@xmath37 and velocity unit is @xmath38 .",
    "in order to investigate the effectiveness of lateral mechanical oscillations and their ability of improving nanoscale tribological properties , we have performed numerical simulations in different ranges of model parameters where the `` natural '' system ( without oscillations ) may exhibit both high dissipative stick - slip dynamics and smooth sliding behaviors .    at a fixed value of the amplitude @xmath39 , fig . [ fig1a ] . shows the influence of the substrate oscillation frequency @xmath11 on the time - averaged friction force @xmath40 , for three distinct values of the driving velocity @xmath41 , corresponding respectively to stick - slip dynamics for @xmath42 and to smooth sliding for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the frequency @xmath11 is varied adiabatically and , for each of its value , @xmath45 is averaged over a sufficiently long simulation time after reaching the dynamical steady state . depending on the external stage velocity , the results presented in fig . [ fig1a ] exhibit two types of resonance minima of friction which are determined by different physical mechanisms .",
    "as we will show shortly the low frequency resonance , which is most pronounced for the low driving velocity ( e.g. , @xmath46 ) , results from the giant enhancement of surface diffusion induced by the oscillations of the substrate , as recently discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the contrary , for",
    "higher driving velocities ( e.g. , @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ) , sharp resonance minima in the average lateral force @xmath49 are caused by the interplay between the system washboard frequency @xmath50 and the oscillation frequency @xmath11 .",
    "an understanding of the effects of lateral substrate vibrations on the frictional properties of the system at low / moderate driving velocities , comes from the study of the diffusion coefficient for the undriven tip as a function of the oscillation frequency @xcite . for low external frequencies @xmath11 ,",
    "the tip apex is able to follow the slow motion of the substrate , performing just small vibrations around the potential minima . under this condition ,",
    "if the thermal energy is sufficiently smaller than the height of the potential barrier , the probability to escape from the potential well is exponentially small . for the optimal",
    "matching of the oscillation frequency @xmath11 and the amplitude @xmath10 , the diffusivity @xmath51 may be considerably enhanced @xcite . in this case",
    ", the tip approaches the maximum of the substrate potential at the end of half cycle of the surface oscillations , where the driving force acting on the tip diminishes .",
    "then , even a weak thermal noise splits the ensemble of tips into two parts that relax to the neighboring minima of the surface potential , and the resonance enhancement of diffusion is observed . a further increase of the frequency leads again to localized dynamics ; in contrast to the case of low frequencies here the tip overcomes the potential barriers and oscillates between neighboring minima of the surface potential .",
    "the resonance enhancement of surface diffusion leads to a corresponding reduction of the mean friction force at @xmath52 which is most pronounced for low driving velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] for @xmath42 ) .",
    "we found that the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] calculated for three oscillation amplitudes @xmath10 are not changed qualitatively with increase of temperature , the diffusion resonance peaks are still visible for higher temperatures but greatly broaden and damped .",
    "the driving force acting on the tip is proportional to the amplitude of oscillations and , as a result , we observe that the resonance frequency decreases with @xmath10 .    by systematically scanning the phase space of the model parameters ,",
    "it is possible to tune the characteristics of the external oscillating excitations , in terms of suitable choices of amplitude and frequency , to achieve very favorable sliding conditions , for which friction almost vanishes or even @xmath53 on average . for a negative value of the lateral friction force , the driving guide , moving at speed @xmath41 , does not pull the tip apex anymore , but it is instead pushed forward by the tip itself .",
    "an example of such a sliding situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , where , once the external guide moving at @xmath42 is detached from the tip , the direct tip motion is fully sustained by the only sinusoidal oscillations of the substrate , at the diffusion resonance @xmath54 . due to highly nonlinear and strongly fluctuating dynamics",
    ", the determination of desirable set of model parameters achieving this `` negative '' friction regime is not always a trivial task .    for higher driving velocities , as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , the mechanism of reduction of friction is essentially different , stemming from the interplay between the system washboard frequency @xmath50 and the oscillation frequency @xmath11 .",
    "this resonant behavior of the driven tip is clearly displayed by sudden and sharp drops of @xmath49 at specific oscillation frequencies @xmath56 , which are given by the formula @xmath57 , with @xmath58 integer .",
    "for an in - depth investigation of these features , we have analyzed the detailed dynamics during the transition across a resonance frequency @xmath59 for the case of an external guide velocity @xmath60 ( see fig . [ fig4a ] ) . due to a dynamical combination of fast sliding and substrate oscillations , for frequencies",
    "@xmath61 the lateral force time series shows an asymmetric sawtooth shape resembling that of the usual stick - slip but with very tiny amplitude ; as soon as @xmath62 the lateral force stops to oscillate , meaning that the guide - tip separation remains constant . finally , when @xmath63 the synchronization is lost and @xmath45 starts again oscillating with doubled frequency , but showing an inverted stick - slip - like behavior .",
    "the resonance marks in general the transition from a negative to a positive phase difference between the characteristic washboard frequency @xmath64 and the oscillation frequency @xmath11 , which is characteristic for parametric resonances .",
    "this effect can lead to significant reduction of friction in the sliding regime of motion , as shown by sharp drops in average and instantaneous lateral forces presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1a ] and [ fig4a ] .",
    "it should be noted that this mechanism of reduction of friction in the sliding state is very different for that discussed above for the stick - slip regime .    during the adiabatic increasing procedure of @xmath11 ,",
    "it has been noted that switching to the resonance @xmath56 at different times may result in distinct values of lateral friction force because of the different initial conditions . due to commensuration between the washboard @xmath64 and the frequency @xmath11 at the resonance @xmath56",
    ", this behavior shows in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] the occurrence of only a discrete set of allowed values for @xmath49 ; the evenly separation between these states is determined by the dimensionless constant @xmath65 .",
    "in summary , the model demonstrates the effectiveness of imposed lateral excitations for the reduction and control of friction at the nanoscale under different regimes of motion ( from stick - slip to smooth sliding ) of a mating contact . for an optimal matching of the oscillation frequency and amplitude , this mechanical manipulation may drive , for example , an interfacial system out of its potential energy minima , thus increasing considerably surface diffusion and mobility , and reducing friction .",
    "unfavorable high dissipative stick - slip motions can be suppressed in favor of the dynamical stabilization of desirable smooth - sliding regimes .",
    "it has been shown that physical mechanisms of the oscillation induced reduction of friction are different for stick - slip and sliding regimes of motion . for stick - slip dynamics , at low driving speed , giant enhancement of surface diffusion takes place . in this case , the observed tribological response may turn to be quite sensitive to thermal effects , able to spoil the sharp resonant nature of this phenomenology . differently , for smooth sliding regimes at high driving velocity , it is the interplay between washboard and oscillation frequencies that determines the occurrence of favorable parametric resonances .",
    "a very careful tuning of the model parameters has been proved to lead to the possibility of a directed motion sustained by the sinusoidal substrate oscillations only .",
