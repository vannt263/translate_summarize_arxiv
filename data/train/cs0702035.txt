    "in the past , @xcite and @xcite have proposed explicit models of spatial correlations in the sensor data .",
    "however , these models are not quite suitable in the context of the spatial correlations in the sensor data in the real data - gathering sensor networks , as the model proposed in @xcite is impractical and the model proposed in @xcite is computationally very intensive . also , this latter model only gives the average number of bits transmitted by a node under a sensor polling schedule , more precisely , the differential entropy of a sensor node conditioned on the data of the nodes which have already transmitted their respective data .",
    "so , this model is not suitable if one wants to compute the number of bits transmitted by a node in the worst - case .",
    "based on these limitations of the aforementioned models and the lack of any other non - trivial , practical model of spatial correlation in sensor data , in this work we propose two such models which are computationally simple , yet capture well our intuition of the spatial correlations in the sensor data .",
    "also , these models can easily be used to compute both , the average and worst case number of bits transmitted by a node under a transmission schedule .",
    "let @xmath0 be the random variable representing the sampled sensor reading at node @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the number of bits that the node @xmath3 has to transmit .",
    "let us assume that each node @xmath3 has at most @xmath4 number of bits to transmit , so @xmath5 .",
    "however , due to the spatial correlation among sensor readings , each sensor may send less than @xmath4 number of bits .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the distance between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "* _ model 1 : _ * let us define @xmath8 , the number of bits that the node @xmath3 has to transmit when the node @xmath7 has already communicated its data , as follows : @xmath9 where the parameters @xmath10 , take care of the various application specific correlation effects .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates this for @xmath11 . here",
    ", it should be noted that when the node @xmath7 has already transmitted its data , then the node @xmath3 transmits no more than @xmath8 bits of its @xmath4 bit data and we define these @xmath8 bits to be the least significant @xmath8 bits of its @xmath4 bit data .",
    "so , if the node @xmath3 knows in _ how many _ bits it needs to transmit its data , then it also knows _ which _ bits of its data it needs to transmit . here",
    "we do not concern ourselves with how a node comes to know of in how many bits it should transmit its data .",
    "this discussion is beyond the scope of the present work and is discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "however , the definition of the correlation model is not complete yet and we must give the expression for the number of bits transmitted by a node conditioned on more than one node already having transmitted their bits .",
    "there are several ways in which this quantity can be defined . here",
    "we have chosen to define it in the following two ways : @xmath13",
    "so , according to equation , the number of bits transmitted by node @xmath3 depends only on its nearest neighbor among all the nodes which have already communicated their data and according to , it depends only on the farthest neighbor among all the nodes which have already communicated their data .",
    "let @xmath14 be the set of nodes which have already transmitted their data .",
    "the rational behind the definition in is that the sampled reading of a node is most correlated with the reading of its nearest neighbor in set @xmath14 .",
    "so , if two nodes are spatially close , then their data is most likely to differ only in the least significant bits . similarly , the intuition behind the definition in is that the sampled reading of a node is least correlated with the reading of its farthest neighbor in the set @xmath14 .",
    "so , the number of bits that a node has to transmit conditioned only on its farthest neighbor in set @xmath14 , gives the upper bound on the number of bits that the particular node has to transmit for the given set @xmath14 .",
    "note that when the nodes transmit their data according to some polling schedule @xmath15 , then denotes the number of bits transmitted by the node @xmath16 when the node @xmath17 has already transmitted its data .",
    "@xmath18 in and should be interpreted similarly .",
    "also note that for the correlation models in and , the sum of the number of bits transmitted by all the nodes depends on the transmission schedule according to which the nodes transmit their data .",
    "* _ model 2 : _ * let us generalize the previous model of spatial correlation in sensor data and define @xmath8 , the number of bits that the node @xmath3 has to transmit when the node @xmath7 has already communicated its data , as follows : @xmath19 where the parameters @xmath20 , take care of the various application specific correlation effects .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates this for @xmath21 .",
    "once more , it should be noted that when the node @xmath7 has already transmitted its data , then the node @xmath3 transmits no more than @xmath8 bits of its @xmath4 bit data and we define these @xmath8 bits to be the least significant @xmath8 bits of its @xmath4 bit data .",
    "so , if the node @xmath3 knows in _ how many _ bits it needs to transmit its data , then it also knows _ which _ bits of its data it needs to transmit .    for the small values ( in magnitude ) of the exponent on the right - hand side and @xmath22 , the correlation model in reduces to the correlation model in , if we identify @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "so , the model in is the linear approximation of the model in .",
    "the intuition behind the above model of correlation is that the number of bits that a node has to transmit , with the nodes in the set @xmath14 having already transmitted their data , should be the ( weighted ) average of number of the bits that the particular node has to transmit conditioned on all the node in the set @xmath14 individually .",
    "the choice of the exponential dependence on the internode distance is based on the _ gaussian _ correlation model proposed in @xcite .",
    "note once more that when the nodes transmit their data according to some polling schedule @xmath15 , then denotes the number of bits transmitted by the node @xmath16 when the node @xmath17 has already transmitted its data .",
    "@xmath18 in should be interpreted similarly .",
    "also note that for the correlation model in , the sum of the number of bits transmitted by all the nodes depends on the transmission schedule according to which the nodes transmit their data ."
