    "the minimal ued ( mued ) model with one extra dimension has been implemented in the pythia generator from version 6.4.18 onwards .",
    "the additional possibility of gravity mediated decays has also been included .",
    "the model uses 1-loop corrected mass formulae and tree - level expressions for cross section and decay width calculations .",
    "the main point of this work is to facilitate complete collider phenomenology studies of ued signatures , by combining the leading - order production and decay matrix elements discussed in the main body of this paper with the more traditional components of the pythia generator : sequential resonance decays , parton showers , hadronization , and modeling of the underlying event . due to the typically large absolute mass scales and relatively small mass differences in the mued model , additional qcd jets from initial - state radiation",
    "can be an important source of combinatorial error when attempting to identify the jets emitted in decays of colored kk particles .",
    "the ued implementation is compatible with both the old ( @xmath5-ordered @xcite ) and new ( @xmath6-ordered @xcite ) shower and underlying - event models available in pythia 6.4 .",
    "hopefully , this will make it easier to evaluate not only the overall impact of the qcd corrections , but also to gain some insight into their uncertainties .",
    "large qcd uncertainties may sometimes be reduced by the application of matrix - element - to - parton - shower matching methods ( see , e.g. , the reviews in @xcite ) , but this was deemed beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "this work was started at the les houches workshop in 2005  @xcite first using the calchep and comphep event generators  @xcite and since then ongoing work has been carried out in the atlas  @xcite , international gdr  @xcite , and mc4bsm  @xcite contexts .",
    "the next step will be to implement the model in c++ in pythia8 @xcite .",
    "we furthermore intend to include the whole set of gravity mediated decay widths , but deemed this low priority at present , since only a small region of parameter space is concerned , where the mass splitting and gravity mediated widths are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "likewise , for studies concentrating on the top sector , the doublet - singlet mixing effects in the kk top sector should be included .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to include also the excitations of the sm higgs fields as well as the effects of potentially resonant kk number violating interactions mediated by the 2nd level kk states @xcite .",
    "we warmly thank torbjrn sjstrand and steve mrenna for help with the implementation . without their consent but also keen collaboration , this work would not have been possible .",
    "we are indebted to c.  macesanu , c.  mcmullen and s.  nandi for sharing both their knowledge and their codes for widths and radiatively corrected masses with us .",
