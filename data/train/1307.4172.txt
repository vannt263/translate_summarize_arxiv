    "as part of an optical spectral survey of post - agb candidates in the magellanic clouds , we have discovered 14 stars that show bandheads of the tio molecule in emission .",
    "the post - agb candidates were selected because they had excess mid - infrared emission in their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , indicating the presence of circumstellar dust , and presumably gas .",
    "normal red giant or main - sequence stars with effective temperatures t@xmath2k ( the m stars ) show tio bands in absorption .",
    "however , a small number of stars have previously been found to show tio bands in emission . @xcite and @xcite have found 3 nearby young stellar objects ( ysos ) which show tio bands in emission .",
    "these stars have various other emission lines , especially h@xmath3 , and @xcite and @xcite argue that their ysos have accretion disks and that the tio band emission comes from dense circumstellar gas with n @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the accretion disk .",
    "an earlier study by @xcite found 4 be stars in which they tentatively identified emission in the tio bandhead at 6159 ( our spectra of some of these be stars , to be published elsewhere , show additional bandheads of tio at longer wavelengths , confirming the findings of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the be stars also show a mid - ir flux excess in their seds and are known to be surrounded by disks of dust and gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimate a gas density greater than @xmath110@xmath8 @xmath6 for the circumstellar gas in their stars with tio bands in emission . both ysos and be stars which show tio band emission have been found to also show the first overtone band of the co molecule in emission at 2.3@xmath9 m @xcite .",
    "the common feature linking the ysos and be stars is a circumstellar disk and it therefore seems that a circumstellar disk of gas and dust is an essential component for the production of tio band emission and the unusual temperature structure it requires .",
    "a common feature of binary post - agb stars is the presence of a circumbinary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so these stars could also potentially show tio bands in emission . here , we describe objects with tio band emission in the magellanic clouds that are possible post - agb or post - rgb star binaries , or ysos .",
    "full details of the selection of objects , spectral observations , data reduction and estimation of luminosity and @xmath10 are given by @xcite . in brief",
    ", post - agb candidates were selected using photometry of magellanic cloud stars from the spitzer space telescope surveys sage @xcite and sage - smc @xcite combined with optical ubvi photometry from @xcite for the smc and @xcite for the lmc .",
    "candidates were selected mostly for their strong 24 @xmath9 m and/or 8 @xmath9 m flux excesses .",
    "optical spectra were taken with the multi - fibre aaomega spectrograph @xcite and have a resolution of @xmath11300 and a wavelength range of @xmath137008800 .",
    "a computer program was created which automatically derived @xmath10 , @xmath11 and [ fe / h ] by comparing the observed spectra to synthetic spectra from @xcite . given the large amount of molecular band emission superimposed on our observed spectra , additional uncertainties are associated with the parameters derived by this procedure .",
    "we therefore also made eye - estimates of the spectral type using the spectral features in the interval @xmath13700 - 4700   shown in @xcite ( predominantly balmer lines , ca ii h and k lines and the g - band ) .",
    "@xmath10 was then computed using the ( @xmath10 , spectral type ) relation given by @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists these values of @xmath10 along with spectral types and the automatically derived values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and [ fe / h ] . in general , the two values of @xmath10 are reasonably similar .",
    "the luminosities of the central stars were computed in two ways .",
    "first , after removing a foreground extinction corresponding to e(b - v)=0.08 and 0.12 @xcite for the lmc and smc , respectively , and using the extinction law of @xcite , the apparent luminosity was computed by integrating under the sed made from the photometry described above , along with wise photometry in the w14 bands @xcite .",
    "the absolute luminosities @xmath12 were then obtained by applying distance modulii of 18.54 and 18.93 @xcite for the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "we also note that the heliocentric radial velocities of all the stars ( table  [ tab1 ] ) are consistent with membership of the magellanic clouds so the adopted distance modulii are appropriate .    for circumstellar dust that is not in a spherically symmetric distribution , @xmath12 could be either an overestimate or an underestimate .",
    "for example , in the case of a dense disk obscuring the central star but only capturing a fraction of the 4@xmath13 steradians of photospheric emission , @xmath12 will be an underestimate of the total emission while if the disk is oriented so that its pole points to the observer , @xmath12 will be an overestimate .",
    "the second method of computing the luminosity of the central star has several steps .",
    "firstly , the intrinsic colours of the central star were derived from the estimated @xmath10 ( the automatically derived @xmath10 was used ) .",
    "the reddening was then derived by finding the value of e(b - v ) that minimized the sum of the squared differences between the dereddened observed and the intrinsic b , v , i and j magnitudes .",
    "the @xcite extinction law was used . using the derived e(b - v )",
    ", the observed magnitudes were corrected for extinction .",
    "then the bvij fluxes of the best - fit model atmosphere from the @xmath10 estimation procedure were normalized to the corrected bvij fluxes .",
    "the bolometric correction to v for the model atmosphere , coupled with the distance modulii to the lmc and smc then allowed the derivation of the photospheric luminosity @xmath14 .",
    "we note that this luminosity should be free from errors caused by asymmetry in the circumstellar dust distribution except when there is a substantial non - photospheric flux in the bvij bands from emission or scattering by circumstellar matter .",
    "this is known to occur in some cases e.g. in the bipolar post - agb star known as the red rectangle @xcite .",
    "there will also be uncertainties in the luminosity arising from errors in the estimation of @xmath10 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath14 and @xmath12 gives some estimate of the errors involved : a large difference between the two values , which occurs in two cases , suggests a non - spherical distribution of circumstellar dust .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath12 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] together with the total reddening e(b - v ) to the photosphere estimated as described above .",
    ".properties of the objects [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,>,^,<,^,>,>,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     notes : u , b , v and i magnitudes from @xcite , j , h , k , [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , [ 8.0 ] and [ 24 ] from the sage @xcite and sage - smc @xcite + catalogs and w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 from the wise catalog . where no magnitude exists , a value of ... is given .",

    "the dereddened sed consists of the photospheric emission from the central star and moderate amounts of excess mid - ir emission at wavelengths longer than @xmath11.2@xmath9 m .",
    "this is as expected for stars surrounded by dust that absorbs a fraction of the photospheric flux and re - emits it in the near- to mid - ir",
    ". the dust could be in a disk or a close - in circumstellar shell .",
    "the sed of the star j005514.24 - 732505.3 is very unusual , with the mid - ir luminosity dominating the photospheric luminosity .",
    "the luminosity @xmath12 obtained by integrating under the sed for j005514.24 - 732505.3 is @xmath15 times the luminosity @xmath14 estimated for the photosphere of the optically visible star . for a single star",
    ", this luminosity ratio requires a special geometry with a thick disk seen edge - on .",
    "the disk obscures the central star whose optical light is seen mainly by scattering of light emerging through the poles of the disk . from detailed modelling , @xcite state that @xmath12 can be several times @xmath14 in this case .",
    "another possibility is that there is a second _ luminous _ star embedded with the observed star , or there is another independent object coincident on the sky with the optically observed star .",
    "the object j052023.97 - 695423.2 has a similarly large @xmath12 . for it , @xmath12 is @xmath12.8 times the luminosity @xmath14 .",
    "j052023.97 - 695423.2 has previously been classified as a high - probability yso candidate - see section  [ hrd_sect ] .",
    "the full observed optical spectra for the objects studied here are shown in figure  [ full_spec ] .",
    "the absolute flux values for the spectra were obtained by matching the relative fluxes of the observed spectra to the photometric b , v and i values .",
    "a range of spectral types are present , from hot stars with strong balmer absorption lines to cool stars with calcium triplet lines in absorption but no paschen lines .",
    "tio band emission is prominent in all the spectra . in order to see the tio emission better ,",
    "the spectra were divided by a low - order polynomial fit to the continuum .",
    "they were then re - plotted from 60008700   in figure  [ tio_spec ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ tio_spec ] shows the spectrum of a late m star with the position of tio and vo absorption bands marked .",
    "it is clear that for the objects being studied here , there is tio emission in most of the tio bands in the spectral region shown .",
    "it is not clear that there is any vo band emission .",
    "the existence of this emission indicates the presence near the central star of molecular gas with a temperature less than @xmath14000k and with a temperature profile that increases toward the observer .",
    "the origin of this temperature structure is unclear - see @xcite for a discussion of possibilities .    about half the spectra",
    "also show h@xmath3 in emission ( see table  [ tab1 ] and figures  [ full_spec ] and [ tio_spec ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission in j010628.81 - 715204.8 and j050747.45 - 684351.2 shows a p cygni profile corresponding to wind terminal velocities of approximately 430 and 350 km s@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "j010628.81 - 715204.8 also shows the calcium triplet lines in emission .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission lines in j005504.57 - 723451.1 and j052023.97 - 695423.2 are resolved , and their observed profiles correspond to the instrumental profile convolved with gaussian velocity distributions of standard deviation 100 and 180 km s@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission in j052023.97 - 695423.2 also has broad wings extending out to 900 km s@xmath15 .",
    "we note that h@xmath3 emission is common in ysos with disks that are accreting surrounding gas @xcite but it is also common in post - agb stars @xcite .    in some stars , the [ oiii ]",
    "5007@xmath16 emission line can be seen .",
    "this is most likely lmc background emission not associated with the object .",
    "such emission is very hard to remove with a multi - fibre spectrograph which samples the sky at random points over a two degree field .",
    "the stars are shown in the hr - diagram in figure  [ hrd ] along with evolutionary tracks for pre - main - sequence stars , normal post - main - sequence stars , and post - agb and post - rgb stars .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath14 values are shown .",
    "in general , these two values do not differ greatly compared to the overall spread in luminosity values , except for the two stars mentioned in section  [ sed_sec ] where the dust is most likely in a thick edge - on disk or where a second object may be contributing to @xmath12 thereby making it too large .",
    "for the range of observed luminosities , it is possible to explain the stars as either pre - main - sequence stars , normal post - main - sequence stars on helium core burning loops , or post - agb or post - rgb stars .",
    "however , given that our observed stars all have large amounts of hot circumstellar material , it is unlikely that they are in the rather quiet evolutionary stage of helium core burning .",
    "the most likely stars to have mass loss and an infrared excess in this evolutionary phase are cepheid variables .",
    "yet , observations of these stars in the lmc @xcite shows the mid - ir excess flux at 8@xmath9 m in these stars is about 10% of the photospheric continuum whereas in the present group of objects the mid - ir excess flux at 8@xmath9 m is typically about 10 times the photospheric continuum .",
    "we therefore reject the explanation of these stars as normal post - main - sequence stars .",
    "the other possible evolutionary states for these objects are post - agb or post - rgb star , or pre - main - sequence star . in both the post - rgb and post - agb cases ,",
    "the observed stars must have undergone a binary interaction in order for them to have left their respective giant branches . for rgb stars , which have luminosities @xmath17l@xmath0 , single - star mass loss is insufficient to remove the h - rich envelope and produce a post - rgb star @xcite .",
    "the only way large amounts of mass loss and evolution off the rgb can occur is via binary interaction , presumably a common envelope event that leaves the binary in a tighter orbit than the original one ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for agb stars , large amounts of mass loss can occur either by binary interaction or , for single stars , by the very high mass loss rate `` superwind '' that terminates agb evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , in the magellanic clouds , all the single stars with high mass loss rates , at least for @xmath18/l@xmath19 , are carbon stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given that the stars in the present sample are oxygen - rich because they show tio molecules in their spectra , we believe that only binary interaction could explain a post - agb status .",
    "6717 and 6731   lines .",
    "black lines are the observed spectra and red dotted lines are the best - fit model spectra . ]",
    "it is not easy to distinguish between post - rgb / agb binaries and pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "both are surrounded by large amounts of circumstellar gas which is accreting ( or re - accreting in the case of post - rgb / agb stars ) onto a circumstellar or circumbinary disk .",
    "however , a distinguishing feature is the gravity of the central star .",
    "we note that , at a given luminosity , the mass of a pms star is about 1520 times that of the corresponding post - rgb / agb star .",
    "this leads to a difference of @xmath11.3 in @xmath11 between pms stars and post - rgb / agb stars .",
    "the errors in our @xmath11 estimates for individual stars are typically 0.5 @xcite , although the presence of strong tio emission bands in the current set of stars almost certainly increases the error . given the expected @xmath11 difference , we can use the derived @xmath11 values in table  [ tab1 ] to make a tentative assignment of pms or post - rgb / agb status .",
    "this evolutionary status , pms or post - rgb / agb , is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the distinction between post - rgb and post - agb status is based on whether @xmath14 is less than or greater than , respectively , the rgb tip luminosity @xmath20l@xmath0 .",
    "we estimate that there are 4 post - rgb stars , 2 post - agb stars and 6 pms stars , the latter including the 4 stars hotter than @xmath21k . for two stars ,",
    "a status could not be assigned because the estimated @xmath11 was almost mid - way between the pms and post - rgb / agb values .",
    "although some of the objects in our sample have been assigned pms status on the basis of their gravities , there is a problem with the existence of optically visible pms stars in the part of the hr - diagram where these objects are observed .",
    "pms stars to the right the `` birth line '' shown in figure  [ hrd ] should not be seen optically @xcite since the stars will have evolved to the birth line or beyond before the optically thick accretion process has completed .",
    "a possible way around this would be to invoke an asymmetry in the accretion process that would allow the central star to be seen through a gap in the surrounding material ( for example , along the pole of the accretion disk ) . the birth line shown in figure  [ hrd ]",
    "was computed for galactic stars with a galactic population i abundance . the lower abundance in the smc and lmc could make the circumstellar material more transparent so that pms stars could be seen in an earlier phase of evolution .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite invoked the lower metallicity of the lmc to explain the optical visibility of a group of pms candidates in the lmc of o and b spectral type .",
    "we note that our pms candidates are much cooler than those of @xcite and @xcite so that the effect of asymmetry or metallicity would need to be much more pronounced than for their stars .",
    "the evolutionary status , pms or post - rgb / agb , assigned here should be considered tentative .",
    "at least one of the stars we have classified as a pms star , j052023.97 - 695423.2 , has in the past been classified consistently as a yso , strongly suggesting a pre - main - sequence status .",
    "it was observed as part of the sage - spec mir - spectral survey @xcite and was classified as a yso .",
    "it was found to have silicate dust emission , consistent with the oxygen - rich atmosphere that we have detected .",
    "j052023.97 - 695423.2 was also classified as a high - probability yso in the study of @xcite which used broad - band near- and mid - ir colours and luminosities to statistically separate various classes of objects .",
    "three of the objects show strong li lines and several other stars show marginal detections ( figure  [ li_fig ] and table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "relatively strong li lines are found in pms stars only before the li is destroyed by nuclear reactions in the stellar interior ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this occurs when the star is convective to the surface , then the surface li will be depleted .",
    "the pms evolutionary tracks of @xcite show that deuterium burning starts early in the evolution of stars with the luminosities observed here , at @xmath22k .",
    "the stars observed to have strong li lines ( j005355.00 - 731900.9 , j051516.28 - 685539.7 and j052230.40 - 685923.9 ) have @xmath23k so the presence of the li lines is consistent with pms status . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , one of these stars ( j052230.40 - 685923.9 ) is considered a pms star based on its @xmath11 value , while the other strong li sources are a post - rgb star ( j005355.00 - 731900.9 ) and a post - agb star of low luminosity ( j051516.28 - 685539.7 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "strong li lines are a feature of agb evolution at higher masses and luminosities ( @xmath25 ) where hot - bottom burning occurs @xcite but we do not expect strong li lines in low - luminosity rgb or agb stars .",
    "this suggests that j005355.00 - 731900.9 and j051516.28 - 685539.7 may also be pms stars , contradicting their post - rgb / agb status based on @xmath11 values .",
    "and @xmath26 , respectively . the light curve of j005355.00 - 731900.9 has been folded with a period of 193 days .",
    "point colours are as in figure  [ light_curves ] . ]",
    "light curves from the macho @xcite and/or the ogle ii and ogle iii experiments @xcite exist for 13 of the 14 stars in our sample , and they are shown in figure  [ light_curves ] .",
    "the stars show a range of types of variability .",
    "j005504.57 - 723451.1 and j010324.36 - 723803.5 are the only stars that show no detectable variability ( the small annual variation that can be seen in the macho observations for j005504.57 - 723451.1 are an artifact of the data reduction ) .",
    "these stars are shown as crosses in figure  [ hrd ] .",
    "most other stars show variability that is a combination of a slow long - term brightening or fading and variability with periods from 30 days to more than 3000 days .",
    "the 6 stars j004805.01 - 732543.0 , j005355.00 - 731900.9 , j005514.24 - 732505.3 , j010628.81 - 715204.8 , j050747.45 - 684351.2 and j052023.97 - 695423.2 all show slow variations in magnitude over intervals longer than @xmath11000 days , possibly due to slow changes in dust obscuration or variability in the rate of accretion .",
    "j004805.01 - 732543.0 was fairly constant for the first 1500 days of observation after which it brightened by about one magnitude and exhibited an oscillation whose period decreased from @xmath11150 days to @xmath1400 days over an interval of 4500 days .",
    "this oscillation is shown in figure  [ lc_dt ] from jd-2448800 = 1500 onwards after the long term trend in magnitude was removed by fitting a fifth - order polynomial in time .",
    "the oscillation looks rv tauri - like ( alternating deep and shallow minima ) but it is unlikely that the interior structure of the star associated with this object could change enough on such a short timescale that a period of pulsation could change by the observed amount .",
    "it is therefore likely that this phenomenon is associated with an accretion event in a surrounding disk , with disk viscosity causing the radius of the accreted material and orbital period to shrink rapidly .",
    "this star is shown as an open square in figure  [ hrd ] .    as well as",
    "the slow magnitude changes in j005355.00 - 731900.9 , there is also an eclipse - like or rv tauri - like variation with a period between deep minima of 193 days . the phased - up light curve in the interval @xmath26 is shown in figure  [ lc_dt ] after the long - term trend was removed by fitting a fifth - order polynomial in time .",
    "such a period seems too long for an rv tauri star : @xcite and @xcite find a maximum period of about 110 days for rv tauri stars in the lmc and @xcite find a maximum period of about 100 days for rv tauri stars in the smc ( in rv tauri stars , the period is taken to be the time between the alternate deep minima ) .",

    "the period of 206 days is much longer than that of any population ii cepheid in the magellanic clouds @xcite but the star lies close to the instability strip shown in figure  [ hrd ] for these stars .",
    "the rapid increase in amplitude in this star suggests that it is rapidly evolving through the pulsational instability strip into a region where growth rates are larger .",
    "one problem with the interpretation of the 206 day cycle as pulsation is that when the amplitude reaches @xmath11 magnitude , the light curve maintains a sinusoidal shape rather than changing to the saw - tooth shape typical of cepheids with this amplitude .",

    "it is perhaps not surprising that variability characteristics are not an unambiguous pointer to the evolutionary state .",
    "both pms stars and post - rgb / agb stars are expected to be surrounded by large amounts of circumstellar dust that is clearing so that long - term slow changes in brightness would be expected in both cases .",
    "similarly , both groups of stars originate on the hayashi track and cross the instability strip so they might be expected to show the same type of pulsational variability , although the pms stars should have shorter periods at a given luminosity because of their higher mass .",
    "given the various results presented above , we provide here a synthesis of the properties of each object and comment on the possible evolutionary state . as a starting point",
