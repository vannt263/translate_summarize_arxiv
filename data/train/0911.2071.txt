    "being an inherent feature of a human , laziness was always that force which engendered invention of new devices , supposed to work instead of people . and in our epoch of vast technological progress , there are thousands of useful gadgets already existing .",
    "though recently the science is advancing with seven - league strides , there are still a great number of phenomena which are waiting for a better insight .",
    "one has to admit that none of the existing complex machines and powerful computers can substitute a single human brain . which means that we still do not draw close enough to clearing up a mystery of how this accumulation of grey matter really works .    since the end of the last century",
    ", study of neural networks picks up speed . in order to describe its intricate behavior ,",
    "the brain is often represented as an ensemble of coupled nonlinear dynamical elements , capable of producing spikes and exchanging information between each other @xcite .",
    "such neural populations are usually spatially localized and contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons @xcite .",
    "some researchers , starting from the simplest case of two interconnected neurons , show how more complicated dynamics emerges in larger sets @xcite .",
    "the others explore extremely complex network of subnetworks , focusing on the hierarchically clustered organization of interacting excitable elements @xcite .",
    "most studies base on the present oscillatory behavior of individual system elements , which then produces observable patterns due to collective synchronization @xcite .",
    "thus , for modeling a single neuron , phase oscillators are often used .",
    "for instance , to characterize mutual dynamics of cells in certain brain areas , responsible for giving the onset to parkinson s disease or epilepsy , a well - known kuramoto model is considered @xcite .    here , we rely on the works by fitzhugh @xcite and nagumo _ et al._@xcite who have shown that for describing the main characteristics of a neuron dynamics , it is sufficient to consider a 2-dimensional system .",
    "the latter is also widely used nowadays as one of the simplest models for examining brain dynamics and has been essentially studied in many papers ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "having an intention to move from simple to complex , we consider below a set of equations consisting only of two identical fitzhugh - nagumo subsystems ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "their interaction is described by a linear coupling term which includes delays ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , accounted for the fact that the signal transmission between neurons is not instantaneous : @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the phase coordinates for the first and the second subsystem respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 determines whether the individual neuron is in the excitable regime or exhibits self - sustained periodic firing .",
    "the time scale parameter @xmath6 is chosen during the numerical simulations to be @xmath7 , which results in fast activator variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 and slow inhibitor variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "for further simplicity , the coupling strength @xmath12 is also taken symmetric .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the dynamics of an isolated 2-dimensional fitzhugh - nagumo system is already well - investigated .",
    "its single fixed point @xmath13 is stable for @xmath14 and exhibits a supercritical hopf bifurcation when the excitability parameter crosses unity , which implies periodic spiking for @xmath15 .",
    "provided that @xmath14 , the system is excitable , namely , if a sufficient external impulse is added , it emits a spike and then rests again in the @xmath16 state .    for our numerical simulations ,",
    "we take @xmath17 , so that the individual subsystems are in the excitable regime .",
    "the coupling term of the considered form is canceled for a fixed point orbit , thus , the 4-dimensional equilibrium @xmath18 , being existent for the uncoupled system , persists as well for the eq .",
    "( [ eq : fhn ] ) . changing the coupling strength or the delays",
    "also does not influence its stability , as it was recently shown @xcite .",
    "however , besides the stable fixed point solution , the system ( [ eq : fhn ] ) can also produce periodic oscillations .",
    "intuitively , this phenomenon can be explained as follows .",
    "one can perturb , for instance , the first neuron , so that it emits a spike . then , with the delay @xmath0 this perturbation reaches the second neuron , which provokes it to spike as well . again with the delay @xmath1 the second neuron `` informs '' the first one that it has been stimulated , which causes a new run of the cycle , and the process repeats ( see schematic representation in the fig  [ fig : sch_lng](a ) ) .",
    "though , in the numerical simulations , starting from various initial conditions , we observed periodic solutions of _ two _ different types , which are referred to in the following as a `` long '' and a `` short '' cycle respectively .",
    "the former is of the period @xmath19 , while the latter has the period @xmath20 .",
    "+    again , intuitively , to obtain this second solution one would add an initial impulse not to one , but to both neurons , then roughly the short cycle dynamics can be plotted as in the fig .",
    "[ fig : sch_lng](b ) .",
    "one could remark that , in this case , the initial perturbation for the second neuron should arrive before the delayed signal of the first one , namely for @xmath21 . although there are infinitely many variations for choosing the time moment for the second impulse , in our numerical simulations we were able to observe only that pattern , which is depicted in the fig .",
    "[ fig : sch_lng](b ) .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : difcyc ] , we plot the phase portraits and the data series for these two attractors for certain fixed parameter values .",
    "the next point to investigate in connection with the periodic firing patterns obtained , is a question whether these solutions exist for all couplings .",
    "is their stability region large enough or such solutions appear only for separate parameter values ?      as it was already noticed in @xcite , such oscillations appear through a saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles , creating a pair of a stable and an unstable periodic orbit . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : long_bc](a ) , the bifurcation curves of this attractor type are plotted in the @xmath22-plane , for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to conclude , that with increasing @xmath1 the bifurcation curve moves to the left , closer to the wall value @xmath26 .",
    "+    this implies that for some large enough coupling periodic firing still exists even if one of the delays is close to zero . for comparison , in the fig .",
    "[ fig : long_bc](b ) , the bifurcation curve for the case @xmath27 is present . when overlaying the two graphs of ( a ) and ( b ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : long_bc](c ) ) , one can notice that the critical coupling value ( indicated by a vertical dashed line ) does not depend on the delay times difference , but only on their sum ( see appendix ) .    in support to this last statement",
    ", we depict in the fig .",
    "[ fig : long_comp](a , b ) phase portraits and time series for three different periodic solutions , namely @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while the sum of delays is always 4 and the coupling strength @xmath31 .",
    "as it could be clearly seen , the phase trajectories coincide perfectly as well as the time series .",
    "we also would like to examine the question how the cycle period is related to the coupling terms .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig : long_prd_vs](a ) represents several plots of the orbit period @xmath32 vs. @xmath0 , while @xmath33 and @xmath31 .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : long_prd_vs](b ) , dependence of the period on @xmath12 is depicted ( @xmath1 is the same as in ( a ) , and @xmath0 is chosen so that the sum of delays does not change ) . as it is expected ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath32 increases linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "however , it decays with increasing @xmath12 .      for the short cycle",
    ", the situation is almost the same .",
    "again it is born through a saddle - node bifurcation .     +    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : short_bc](a ) , we also plot the bifurcation curves , separating the regions of existence and absence of the short cycle , in the @xmath22-plane ( as earlier @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . again with increasing @xmath1",
    "the bifurcation curve moves to the left , however , in comparison with the long cycle the short one occurs for larger values of coupling strength . and after laying over the curve for the case of equal delays @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : short_bc](b ) ) , one can notice that the critical @xmath12 depends only on the delays sum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : short_bc](c ) ) .",
    "the phase portraits and the time series for three different periodic solutions , plotted in the fig .",
    "[ fig : short_comp ] , coincide as well .    finally , in the fig .",
    "[ fig : short_prd_vs](a),(b ) , the graphs disclosing the relation between the period and the coupling term configuration are presented . as in the case of the long cycle",
    ", @xmath32 is a linear function of @xmath0 and has a gradual decrease on @xmath12 .",
    "in the present paper we have considered two asymmetrically delay - coupled fitzhugh - nagumo systems for modelling interacting excitable neural elements .",
    "such an `` intrusion '' gives rise to the regular spiking in the system investigated .",
    "for sufficiently large coupling strength and delays , one can observe periodic solutions of two different types ( long and short cycles ) , depending on whether only one subsystem is perturbed initially or both .",
    "the long cycle period approximately equals @xmath34 , while the short one has a period of about a half of this amount .",
    "furthermore , the numerical simulation , as well as the mathematical anlysis , shows that phase portraits and time series of these solutions do not depend on the difference of delays , but only on their sum .",
    "support from dfg in the framework of sfb 555 is acknowledged .",
    "the authors would like to thank g.  hiller , p.  hvel and v.  zykov for fruitful discussions and remarks .",
    "consider the general system @xmath35 without losing generality assume that @xmath36 and denote @xmath37 and @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". then introducing a new function @xmath41 we use @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensys1 ] ) and rewrite the equation ( [ eq : gensys2 ] ) as follows @xmath43 which leads to @xmath44 this corresponds to a system with symmetric delay coupling , and the function @xmath45 fully coincides with the function @xmath46 of the initial problem , but with a _ shift _ along the time axis by @xmath47",
    ".    we also note that the inhibitor variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 of the system ( [ eq : fhn ] ) depend only on @xmath48 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "therefore , omitting them in the above analysis does not influence the resulting conclusion ."
