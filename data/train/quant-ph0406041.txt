    "revolutionary new experimental techniques have made possible precise measurements of casimir forces@xcite .",
    "casimir s original prediction for the force between grounded conducting plates due to modifications of the zero point energy of the electromagnetic field has already been verified to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "variations with the conductor geometry and the effects of finite conductivity and finite temperature will soon be measured as well .",
    "progress has been slower on the theoretical side . despite years of effort , casimir forces",
    "can only be calculated for the simplest geometries . beyond casimir s original study of parallel plates@xcite , we are only aware of useful calculations for a corrugated plate@xcite and for a sphere and a plate@xcite .",
    "the former was obtained with functional integral techniques quite special to that geometry and the latter was obtained by computationally intensive numerical methods .",
    "simple and experimentally interesting geometries like two spheres , a finite inclined plane opposite an infinite plane , and a pencil point and a plane , remain elusive .",
    "the proximity force approximation@xcite ( pfa ) , which has been used for half a century to estimate the dependence of casimir forces on geometry , was shown by gies _",
    "@xcite to deviate significantly from their precise numerical result for the sphere and plane .",
    "thus at present neither exact results nor reliable approximations are available for generic geometries .",
    "it was in this context that we recently proposed a new approach to casimir effects based on classical optics@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is extremely simple : first the casimir energy is recast as a trace of the green s function ; then the green s function is replaced by the sum over contributions from optical paths labelled by the number of ( specular ) reflections from the conducting surfaces .",
    "the integral over the wave numbers of zero point fluctuations can be performed analytically , leaving @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the length of the closed geometric optics ray beginning and ending at the point @xmath2 and reflecting @xmath3 times from the surfaces .",
    "@xmath4 is the enlargement factor of classical optics@xcite , also associated with the @xmath3-reflection path beginning and ending at @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath5 is the subset of the domain , @xmath6 , between the plates in which @xmath3 reflections can occur .",
    "the factor @xmath7 implements a dirichlet boundary condition on the plates ; different boundary conditions require different factors .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath4 are very easy to compute either analytically in simple cases , or numerically in general .",
    "@xmath4 , although well known in optics , may not be familiar in the context of casimir effects .",
    "we will describe its properties in some detail .",
    "( [ eq : cas1 ] ) turns out to be a powerful tool to compute casimir effects for generic geometries , and to identify , interpret and dispose of , divergences .",
    "( [ eq : cas1 ] ) is not exact .",
    "instead it is an approximation which is valid when the natural scales of diffraction are large compared to the scales that measure the strength of the casimir force . in practice",
    "this will typically be measured by the ratio of the separation between the conductors , @xmath8 , to their curvature , @xmath9 .",
    "although approximate , the optical approach is surprisingly accurate , as well as physically transparent and versatile .",
    "it generalizes naturally to the study of casimir thermodynamics , to the study of energy , pressure , and momentum densities , to various boundary conditions , to fermions , and to compact and/or curved manifolds .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers intended to provide an introduction to the optical approach to casimir physics . here",
    "we will focus on fundamentals : how to derive the optical approximation and how to apply it to practical calculations of casimir forces . in later papers in this series we study casimir effects at finite temperature , the calculation of local observables like the energy density and pressure , and the generalization to conducting and other boundary conditions .",
    "our first aim is to familiarize the reader with the use of the optical approximation , since this method of calculation is unfamiliar . in section",
    "ii we present some examples of the use of the optical approximation .",
    "first we review in more detail the treatment of parallel plates already presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although it is no great triumph to rederive this classic result , the optical derivation illustrates several characteristic features of the method : rapid convergence , simple disposal of divergences and ease of computation , in particular .",
    "next we present the case of a sphere and a plate .",
    "this too was summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we concentrate especially on the enlargement factor , both its interpretation and how to compute it .",
    "also we illustrate the generic way that divergences can be eliminated .",
    "the numerical results we present here are more accurate than those of ref .",
    "finally we apply the optical method to the case of a finite plate suspended above an infinite conducting plane  the `` casimir pendulum '' .",
    "we show how all reflections can be computed and how the optical result differs from the proximity force approximation . in collaboration with o.  schroeder we are preparing a thorough study of the hyperboloid ( `` pencil point '' ) near an infinite plane@xcite . in section iii",
    "we discuss the derivation of the optical approximation from exact expressions for the casimir energy .",
    "we show how a uniform approximation to the propagator turns into a uniform approximation for the casimir energy .",
    "the derivation illustrates the nature of the approximation and shows the way toward improvements , which , in essence , amount to including the effects of diffraction .",
    "we present results for a massive scalar field in @xmath10 dimensions in section iii .",
    "higher spin fields will be considered in a later paper of this series .",
    "we discuss the general problem of divergences .",
    "the casimir energy is generically divergent  or more properly , it depends in detail on the cutoffs that limit the conductivity of real materials at high frequency .",
    "however it is known that the casimir _ force _ between rigid conductors is cutoff independent@xcite . in the optical approximation",
    "the cutoff dependent terms in the casimir energy can easily be isolated and shown to be independent of the separation between conductors .",
    "they therefore do not contribute to forces and can be dropped .",
    "corrections to the optical approximation will bring in new surface divergences . in section [ sec : connections ] we discuss the relation of the optical approximation to previous works on `` semiclassical '' approximations to the casimir energy@xcite . in the last section",
    "we summarize our results , discuss their implications , and mention extensions to other interesting geometries .",
    "in this section we present three examples of the use of the optical approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cas1 ] ) .",
    "our aim is expressly pedagogical : we want to demonstrate that this method can yield interesting and accurate results without onerous calculations .",
    "casimir s original result for parallel plates can be derived in many ways .",
    "we present a derivation from the optical approximation in order to illustrate several generic features of the approach in the simplest possible context .",
    "the points we wish to stress are : ease of calculation ; the rapid convergence in @xmath3 , the number of reflections ; and the simple and accurate treatment of divergences . the `` semiclassical '' method@xcite and the method of images@xcite generate exactly the same calculation as ours for parallel plates .",
    "however they do not generalize to less trivial geometries ( although one might say that our method _ is _ the correct generalization of the method of images ) . we study a massless scalar field for simplicity , and quote the generalization to a massive scalar in a later section . for a flat surface the enlargement factor reduces to @xmath11 ,",
    "so the contribution of the @xmath3 reflection path is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the multiplicity of the path .",
    "it is convenient to separate the paths into `` odd '' ( @xmath14 ) and `` even '' ( @xmath15 ) according to the number of reflections .",
    "some of these paths are shown in fig .",
    "[ [ fig : pp ] ] .",
    "odd and even paths differ dramatically in their contribution to the casimir effect : they differ in sign and in multiplicity : @xmath16 for odd paths and @xmath17 for even paths , as shown in the figure .",
    "the length of an even path depends only on @xmath18 , whereas the length of an odd path varies with position .",
    "finally , odd paths contribute a divergence to @xmath19 , but do not contribute to the casimir force .",
    "the even paths are finite and give the entire casimir force .    .",
    "b ) odd reflection paths . the paths shown form a family of continuously increasing length .",
    "another family begins with the first reflection from the top.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    first consider the even paths .",
    "the length of the @xmath20 reflection path is @xmath21 independent of @xmath2 , as can easily be seen in fig  [ [ fig : pp ] ] .",
    "the volume of each domain , @xmath22 , is the volume between the plates , @xmath23 .",
    "hence the contribution from even paths is @xmath24 which is the famous result due to casimir @xcite .",
    "next consider the odd paths .",
    "there are two families .",
    "one is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] .",
    "the other family begins with the first reflection from the top plate .",
    "their contributions are identical , giving an overall factor of two .",
    "the @xmath14 reflection paths range in length from @xmath25 to @xmath26 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ [ fig : pp ] ] , and contribute @xmath27 the first reflection contribution diverges at the lower limit .",
    "as discussed in the introduction ( and further in section iii ) the divergence indicates dependence on the properties of the material composing the plates and is cutoff at a distance scale @xmath28 determined by the microphysics .",
    "for example we can take @xmath28 to be the skin depth or regard @xmath28 as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a frequency cutoff , for example the plasma frequency of the metal . inserting @xmath28 as the lower limit for @xmath31 and summing over @xmath18",
    ", we obtain the contribution of odd paths , @xmath32 this contribution displays the cubic surface divergence expected for a scalar field obeying a dirichlet boundary condition@xcite .",
    "however , the divergent term  and indeed the sum of all odd reflections  is independent of @xmath8 and therefore does not contribute to the _ force _ between the plates .",
    "until now we have not considered the contributions from one - reflection paths that lie below the bottom plate or above of the top plate .",
    "it is easy to see that the sum of these contributions is identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppodd ] ) and does not contribute to the force .",
    "this simple calculation illustrates some general features of the optical approach :    * the even reflections dominate , give rise to attraction , and their sum converges rapidly in @xmath18 .",
    "they are also attractive for neumann boundary conditions , where the factor @xmath7 is absent",
    ". they would be repulsive if one surface were neumann and the other dirichlet .",
    "in the case of parallel plates 92% of the casimir effect comes from the second reflection , 98% from the second and fourth , and 99.3% from the second , fourth and sixth reflections .",
    "similar results will be found to hold in more complicated geometries . *",
    "the only divergent contribution comes from the first reflection .",
    "it does not depend on the separation and therefore does not contribute to the casimir force .",
    "this result is quite general . to see the general argument ,",
    "reconsider the first reflection from the bottom plate , @xmath33 @xmath34 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : self ] ) combined with the contribution of the 1-reflection path outside of the plates ( from the lower face of the bottom plate ) is the cutoff dependent energy of an isolated plate .",
    "it is manifestly independent of the presence of any other conductor , and gives no contribution to casimir forces .",
    "the second term is a finite effect of the first reflection . for parallel plates the finite contribution of the first reflection",
    "is cancelled by higher odd reflections .",
    "this occurs whenever the enlargement factor is @xmath35 , that is , when all the conductors are planar . for non - planar surfaces the first reflection gives a ( relatively small ) cutoff independent contribution to the force . *",
    "the optical approach gives the exact answer for infinite plates .",
    "however it will fail when @xmath36 for the same reason that the capacitance of two finite , parallel metallic plates contains corrections of order @xmath37@xcite : it is a poor approximation to consider the electric field inside two far separated plates ( @xmath38 ) as constant inside and zero outside .",
    "likewise , in the same limit it is a poor approximation to expect the green s function for the field @xmath39 to have contributions only from optical paths .",
    "the corrections , or edge effects , can be regarded as due to diffractive rays coming from the edges of the plates @xcite .",
    "we discuss corrections to the optical approximation in further detail in section iii . *",
    "the difference between even and odd paths has a fundamental origin , as already noticed in work on the `` semiclassical '' approximation to the casimir energy @xcite .",
    "the even paths are truly periodic , in the sense that the momentum of the particle , after going around the path , returns to its initial value",
    ". these are therefore the paths that according to gutzwiller @xcite contribute most to the oscillations of the density of states .",
    "the connection between these paths , the oscillation of the density of states , and the finite part of the casimir energy has been noted many times@xcite and is exact for parallel plates and related geometries ( _ eg . _ flat manifolds with various topologies ) .",
    "however , the exactness of this result is an accident due to the particularly simple geometry .",
    "for example , there are very simple geometries in which periodic paths do not exist at all ( _ eg . _ the casimir pendulum : a finite plane inclined at an angle above an infinite surface ) .",
    "the relation between the optical approach and the `` semiclassical '' approach is discussed further in section iii .",
    "next we analyze a problem with non - planar conductors  typical of real experimental configurations@xcite  a sphere of radius @xmath9 separated by a distance @xmath8 from an infinite plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite we tested the optical approximation by computing the casimir force between a sphere and a plane up through the fourth reflection .",
    "we showed that the optical approximation is in very good agreement with the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath40 .",
    "in fact the numerical results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite suffered from an insufficiently accurate numerical integration algorithm .",
    "the results presented here supercede ref .",
    "@xcite and show that the optical approximation is even more accurate than we originally claimed .",
    "for example , the optical approximation and the numerical data differ by only 30% at @xmath41 . here",
    "we explain in detail how to compute the first and second reflection contributions .",
    "the relevant paths are shown along with some other aspects of the geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphpl ] .        for each reflection we must compute a ) the optical path length , @xmath1 , b ) the enlargement factor , @xmath4 , and c ) the domain of integration @xmath5 for which @xmath3-reflections are possible .",
    "the @xmath5 are subsets of the domain @xmath6 above the plane and outside the sphere .",
    "finding the @xmath3-reflection optical path from @xmath2 back to @xmath2 , @xmath42 , is elementary in principle .",
    "one just draws straight lines from @xmath2 to a given surface , from the arrival point on this surface to another surface , and so on , returning after @xmath3 reflections to the original point @xmath2 .",
    "one then moves the points of reflection on the surfaces until one reaches the minimum total length ( an elastic string would do the job ) .",
    "the minimum length path suffers specular reflection upon each encounter with a surface . in all but",
    "the simplest geometries this problem must be solved numerically .",
    "however it is a problem amenable to extremely quick numerical solution : it is easily defined and the minimum is unique ( at least for convex surfaces ) .",
    "this procedure also defines the points of reflection , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , etc .",
    "the first reflection paths from the sphere ( @xmath45 ) and the plane ( @xmath46 ) and the two reflection path are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sphpl ] ) .",

    "having already identified the points of reflection in [ paths ] it is relatively easy to compute @xmath52 numerically by tracing the paths of a few nearby rays@xcite .",

    "one reflection from the plane is trivial : @xmath53 one reflection from the sphere is simplified by a ) normal incidence , and b ) @xmath54 .",
    "the second reflection can be simplified by regarding it as a single reflection from the sphere starting from @xmath2 and ending at the _ image _ @xmath55 of the original point @xmath2 in the plane . in that case",

    "so for the moment , we put aside the first reflection and consider the cutoff independent contributions from @xmath299 .",
    "in that case we can interchange the @xmath254 and volume integrals .",
    "the resulting @xmath254-integral is also uniformly convergent .",
    "@xmath300 for @xmath299 .",
    "the @xmath254-integral can be performed in general , but is particularly simple for the massless case , @xmath301 , @xmath302 which is the casimir energy associated to the optical path @xmath299 , and generalizes our fundamental result , eq .",

    "we specialize to @xmath284 although the analysis is completely general .",
    "let the boundary of @xmath6 be the surfaces of a set of rigid bodies @xmath307 .",
    "the divergent contributions come from the paths @xmath308 that reflect once on any of the bodies @xmath309 .",
    "to regulate possible divergences we insert a simple exponential cutoff in @xmath254 .",
    "it is easy to see that our results are independent of the form of the cutoff .",
    "then for a massless field , reflecting from body @xmath310 , @xmath311 the @xmath254-integration can be performed , @xmath312 notice that for @xmath313 we reobtain the standard result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cas1 ] ) as we should . when @xmath314 however the structure of the function changes completely .",
    "in particular the _ sign _ changes at @xmath315 .",
    "there is a non trivial consequence of this fact : from eq .",

    "( [ 1refldiv ] ) is negative .",
    "this effect , that the cutoff dependent contribution to the casimir energy density changes sign near the bounding surface , is well known and has figured centrally in recent discussions of casimir energy densities@xcite .",
    "of course the bulk contribution to the vacuum fluctuation energy comes from the zero - reflection term , which is positive .",
    "the negative surface correction is well known and has many physical consequences .",

    "( [ 1refldiv ] ) and replacing @xmath327 , where @xmath328 , and @xmath329 is the surface area element on the body , we get ( up to finite terms arising from upper bounds on the integration in @xmath330 ) @xmath331 where we have suppressed the subscript @xmath332",

    "indicate that terms up to at least the third `` reflection '' in the mre are cutoff dependent .",
    "these higher divergences are omitted from the optical approximation , which is convenient since they do not contribute to casimir forces in any case .",

    "this is due to the fact that 2 ` reflections ' in the mre expansion contribute to the curvature divergence as well and their sign is the same for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions . ] .",
    "stationary phase approximations are not new in the study of casimir energy both at zero and non - zero temperature @xcite",
    ". these works certainly share with ours the attempt to switch the attention toward general properties and approximations to the helmholtz equation .",
    "on the other hand , relying more or less heavily on gutzwiller s trace formula , they suffer from two significant problems .",
    "first , they treat symmetric and nearly symmetric geometries in radically different ways , and fail to provide a natural deformation away from the symmetric limit ( not to mention that they give the exact result for parallel plates only for odd number of space dimensions ) .",
    "second , they require a certain amount of strongly geometry - dependent work ( to calculate monodromy matrices for example ) .",
    "we discuss both these problems further below . in order to study these points",
    "we will rewrite a given contribution @xmath336 ( specializing to @xmath284 dimensions and suppressing the index @xmath3 ) as @xmath337 where @xmath338 our strategy has been to dominate the functional integral over paths from @xmath2 back to @xmath2 by the classical paths , then perform the @xmath254 integral analytically , and to leave the integration over @xmath2 for numerical evaluation .",
    "the standard `` semiclassical '' approach @xcite is to perform all spatial integrations by stationary phase including the one over the argument of the greens function itself .",
    "this leaves a function only of @xmath254 which can be integrated analytically .",
    "the fact that we can do the @xmath2 integral numerically allows us to capture much more detailed information about the system .",
    "we will show this in detail in the following . to underline the differences , let us repeat briefly the line of reasoning leading to gutzwiller s trace formula .",
    "we start by writing an asymptotic expansion for @xmath339 .",
    "the asymptotic contributions to the @xmath340-integral come @xcite both from a ) boundaries at @xmath341 ( minimum and maximum length achieved by the path @xmath3 ) that is _",
    "integration by part _ terms and b ) integrable divergences in the function @xmath342 that is _ stationary phase _ ( sp ) points at @xmath343 . so that @xmath344 @xmath345 are polynomial in @xmath254 , @xmath346 and @xmath347 respectively .",
    "the schaden and spruch @xcite approach based on gutzwiller trace formula @xcite consists in taking only the stationary phase contributions , b ) , to the energy , the coefficients @xmath348 s then being related to the ` monodromy matrix ' .",
    "these terms correspond to closed classical paths , for which the final momentum is equal to the initial one ( the action is @xmath349 ) .",
    "the stationary phase approximation requires the periodic orbits to be well - separated in units of wavelength .",
    "however as one approaches a situation in which one exact symmetry exists , the space , @xmath350 in 3 dimensions , perpendicular to the closed orbit at a given point breaks into the product of two subspaces @xmath351 , and @xmath318 is constant with respect to the @xmath310 coordinates @xmath352 . in the symmetric situation the sp  points then form lines ( or planes if more than one symmetry is present ) parameterized by @xmath352 .",
    "the problem can again be solved easily just by writing @xmath353 and factoring out the integral over @xmath354@xcite leaving the integral over @xmath355 to be evaluated by stationary phase approximation again is parallel to the axis of the cylinder and @xmath8 is the direction perpendicular to this . in the case of parallel plates both the directions @xmath8 and @xmath352",
    "are symmetry directions so they both factor out and no stationary phase approximation is performed . in this case",
    "the former analysis gives an exact result , as is well known . ] .",
    "however , when the symmetry is slightly broken the length @xmath318 acquires a small @xmath352 dependence and the integral over @xmath354 can no longer be factored out .",
    "moreover a naive stationary phase approximation in both @xmath356 is not reliable because arbitrarily close to the breaking point , the dependence of @xmath318 on @xmath352 is small and the hessian matrix @xmath357 has one ( or more ) very small eigenvalues in the old @xmath352 directions .",
    "there exists @xcite a theory for gutzwiller trace formula for approximate symmetries .",
    "however , we found that it is not easy to implement in the study of the casimir energy for arbitrary surfaces .    . for the optical approximation ,",
    "the sum of the first four reflections has been rescaled to go to unity as @xmath104 .",
    "it is possible to show that in the limit @xmath130 the optical approximation and schaden and spruch s formula agree ( in the figure they both tend to @xmath358 ) .",
    "the most notable and relevant discrepancies are in the derivative at small @xmath124.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in the cases in which these problems can be avoided , like a sphere of fixed radius in front of a plane , and for @xmath129 the semiclassical approximation _  la _ schaden and spruch provides quite a good approximation ( see figure ) since in the expansion ( [ eq : jexpansion ] ) the stationary phase approximation gives a much larger contribution than the integration by parts terms .",
    "a much stronger disagreement has to be expected if the sphere gets substituted by a plate of width @xmath133 bent with a curvature of order @xmath359 . indeed",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite differs dramatically from the optical approximation for the case of a hyperboloid@xcite .",
    "this is not a diffraction effect but rather a ` precocious ' breakdown of the semiclassical approximation which is cured by a uniform approximation of the kind we have described .",
    "we have proposed a new method for calculating approximately casimir energies between conductors in generic geometries .",
    "we use a stationary phase approximation imported from studies of wave optics that we have therefore named the `` optical approximation '' . in this paper , the first of the series , we have outlined the derivation and applied it to three examples : the canonical example of parallel plates ; the experimentally relevant situation of a sphere facing a plane ; and the `` casimir pendulum '' , _",
    "i.e. _ a conducting plate free to oscillate above an infinite plate , where the calculations can be performed analytically . in all of the above examples ( except for parallel plates , where our result coincides with casimir solution ) the agreement with the proximity force approximation is only to the leading order in the small distances expansion .",
    "the first order correction is found to be different .",
    "this is of particular importance in the example of the sphere and the plane because the first order correction in @xmath124 ( @xmath8 is the distance sphere - plate and @xmath9 is the radius of the sphere ) will soon be measured by new precision experiments @xcite .",
    "the optical approximation turns the casimir sum over modes into a sum over topologically different paths , and from this point of view can be compared with the poisson summation formula , which has proved useful to derive semiclassical uniform expansions for very diverse problems @xcite . in the case of the casimir energy , replacing the usual highly divergent sum over modes by a sum over topologically distinct optical paths has two , very significant advantages : first , we have been able to show that the divergences in the casimir energy are contained in contributions of very simple , one - reflection paths and can be easily and unequivocally regulated and discarded ; and second , the convergence of the sum over paths is very rapid . instead of requiring an infinite number of eigenvalues with exquisite precision one needs but a few path contributions , calculated with little numerical effort , to give a very good approximation to the casimir energy for important geometries .",
    "`` semiclassical '' methods have been used previously in the study of casimir effects and the connection between closed orbits and the finite part of the casimir energy has been pointed out many times @xcite .",
    "our analysis shares with those the idea of shifting attention to approximations and to properties of the helmholtz propagator .",
    "we have shown however that in order to obtain a correct low curvature approximation one has to use a uniform approximation of the kind we proposed here .",
    "there is plenty of room to improve the approximation presented here , especially when the connection with balian and bloch s multiple reflection expansion is made explicit . in particular",
    "it is intriguing that the casimir energy for the sphere - plane problem is a well - defined problem in a single variable , namely @xmath360 whose limiting values for @xmath361 and @xmath362 are famous @xcite .",
    "one can hope that an analytic solution or an approximation good for the entire range @xmath2-values should be relatively easy to find . on the contrary it is an incredibly difficult problem and nobody has succeeded in finding such an exact solution or a valid approximation . in the next paper",
    "we will show how the same approximation for the propagator can give useful expansions for local operators like the energy - momentum tensor , which allows us to calculate the pressure the energy density and other properties of the constrained field .",
    "we will show what our approach has to say about the thermal corrections , which are a controversial matter in casimir physics . in another paper of the series",
    "we will also perform the same analysis for a field of spin 1/2 and and for the electromagnetic field .",
