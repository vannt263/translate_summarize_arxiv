    "skeleton_. such a graph has a unique drawing ( up to diffeomorphisms of the euclidean plane ) , but there exist many distinct polyhedra having this graph as their skeleton ; all such polyhedra are of the same _ combinatorial type_. the group of isometries of a polyhedron ( so - called _ point group _ ) is a subgroup of the algebraic symmetry group of the graph . by a theorem of mani ( @xcite ) , there is , for each combinatorial type , at least one polyhedron , for which this inclusion becomes equality .",

    "let @xmath10 be a plane graph , such that every of its vertices has at least degree @xmath0 .",

    "any pair of edges sharing a vertex define a zigzag .",
    "given an edge , there are two possible directions for extending it to a zigzag .",
    "hence , each edge is covered exactly twice by zigzags .",
    "a zigzag @xmath34 is called _ simple _ if it has no self - intersection . otherwise , it has at least one edge , say , @xmath35 , in which it self - intersects .",
    "let us choose an orientation on @xmath34 ; call the edge @xmath35 of _ type i _ or _ type ii",
    "_ @xcite if @xmath34 traverses it twice in the opposite or in the same direction , respectively ( see figure [ typei - typeii ] ) .",
    "clearly , the type of edge does not depend on the choice of orientation .",
    "edges of type i and type ii correspond to edges of _ cocycle _ and _ cycle character _ in @xcite .",

    "@xmath39-vector _ of a graph @xmath10 is the vector enumerating the lengths of all its zigzags with their signature as subscript .",
    "the simple zigzags are put in the beginning , in increasing order of length , without their signature @xmath40 , and separated by a semicolon from others .",
    "self - intersecting zigzags are also ordered by increasing lengths .",
    "if there are @xmath41 zigzags of the same length @xmath42 and the same signature @xmath43 , then we write @xmath44 . for a zigzag @xmath34 , its _ intersection vector _",
    "@xmath45 is such that @xmath46 is an increasing sequence of sizes @xmath47 of its intersection with all others zigzags , and @xmath48 denote respective multiplicities .",
    "the length of each zigzag is even , because we consecutively take left and right turns .",
    "but the length of intersection of two simple zigzags can be odd ( see klein and dyck maps on the table [ tab : t1 ] ; they both have oreinted genus @xmath0 and come as quotients of regular triangulations of the hyperbolic plane having valency @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) .",
    "returning to our plane case , the number of intersection can be even only .",
    "a graph is called _ @xmath39-uniform _ if all zigzags have the same length and signature , _ @xmath39-transitive _ if its group acts transitively on zigzags .",
    "clearly , @xmath39-transitivity implies @xmath39-uniformity .",
    "a graph is called _ @xmath39-knotted _ if it has only one zigzag , _ @xmath39-balanced _",
    "if all its zigzags of the same length and same signature , have identical intersection vectors .",
    "clearly , @xmath39-transitivity implies @xmath39-balancedness .",

    "on every zigzag choose an orientation ; there are @xmath53 possibilities .",
    "every edge , being covered twice by zigzags ( one or two ) , can be , with respect to the choosen orientation of all zigzags , oriented in the opposite or same direction .",
    "we call such an edge of _ type i _ or _ type ii with respect to the fixed orientation_. if an edge is a self - intersection edge of some zigzag , then the notion of type is independent of the fixed orientation and coincides with the notion of type i and ii , which was introduced above .",
    "while for dual graphs @xmath13- and @xmath19-vectors are interchanged , the @xmath39-vector remains the same , except that type i and type ii in the signature are interchanged .",
    "other kinds of dualities ( for example , interchanging @xmath39- and @xmath19-vector , but preserving @xmath13-vector ) are considered in @xcite .",
    "the _ medial _ graph @xmath54 of @xmath10 is defined on the set of edges of @xmath10 with two edges being adjacent if they share a common vertex and if they belong to a common face .",
    "the medial graph is @xmath55-valent and @xmath56 .",
    "zigzags of @xmath10 and @xmath22 correspond to central circuits ( see below ) of @xmath54 .",
    "any @xmath55-valent plane graph @xmath57 is the medial graph for a pair of mutually dual plane graphs : one can assign two colors to the faces of @xmath57 in the `` chess way '' , such that no two adjacent faces of @xmath57 have the same color .",
    "two faces of the same color are said to be adjacent if they share a vertex .    in general ,",
    "a _ central circuit _ of an _ eulerian _",
    "( i.e. , having only vertices of even degree ) plane graph is a circuit , which is obtained by starting with an edge and continuing at each vertex by the edge opposite to the entering one .",
    "link _ is one or more circles ( components of a link ) embedded into the space @xmath58 ; a link with one component is called _ knot_. a _ projection _ of a link is a drawing of it on the plane with gaps representing underpass and solid line representing overpass . if a drawing of a link has alternating underpasses and overpasses , then it is called _ alternating _ ; so , we can see it just as a @xmath55-valent plane graph . we will consider only _",
    "minimal _ projections , i.e. , those without @xmath59-gons ( loops ) .",
    "clearly , each edge belongs to exactly one central circuit and any @xmath55-valent graph without @xmath59-gons can be seen as a minimal projection of an alternating link with components corresponding to its central circuits . since zigzags in @xmath10 correspond to central circuits in @xmath54 , each zigzag corresponds to a component of the corresponding alternating link .",
    "the bipartition of edges of a @xmath39-knotted graph into type i and type ii corresponds to a bipartition of the vertices of its medial graph ( which is a projection of an alternating knot ) .    call a polyhedron _ two - faced _ if it has only @xmath1- and @xmath2-gonal faces with @xmath60",
