    "the hexagonal planar array of carbon atoms in graphene is resolvable into two inter - twined triangular sub - lattices .",

    "later - on , it was realized that opting for suitable substrate , like hexagonal boron nitrate ( hbn ) , can break the sub - lattice symmetry of the system to induce massive dirac excitations in graphene @xcite .",
