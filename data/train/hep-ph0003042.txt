    "a deeper understanding of the transition from perturbative qcd to nonperturbative pomeron physics in deep inelastic scattering at low @xmath0 and small @xmath1 remains one of the central tasks in hera physics .",
    "approaching the transition region from the perturbative side , one expects to see the onset of large perturbative corrections - in particular those which belong to higher twist operators in qcd .",
    "the twist expansion defines a systematic approach and , therefore , provides an attractive framework of investigating the region of validity of the leading - twist nlo dglap evolution equations .",
    "the essentials of the theory of higher twist operators and their @xmath0-evolution have been laid down twenty years ago : a choice of a complete operator basis has to be made  @xcite , and for the evolution  @xcite one needs to compute evolution kernels which , for partonic operators in leading order , reduce to @xmath11 kernels . the problems of mixing between different operators of a given twist has also been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations have been done mainly for fermionic operators . in the small-@xmath1 region at hera , however , we expect gluonic operators to be the most important ones .",
    "recently , a first attempt has been carried out to analyze the twist-4 gluonic operators in the double - logarithmic approximation ( dla )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to analytic calculations also a first numerical analysis has been presented .",
    "as one of the main results , it has been pointed out that , due to a complicated sign structure , subtle cancellations among different twist-4 corrections are possible . as to the numerical results , the freedom in choosing initial conditions for twist-4 gluonic operators , in combination with our presently very limited knowledge of the twist-4 evolution equations ,",
    "make a systematic qcd study of higher twist corrections in the low-@xmath0 and small-@xmath1 region at hera a rather difficult but challenging task .",
    "+   + in order to gain a detailed insight into the role of higher twist it may be helpful to discuss in some detail the simplest low - order qcd - diagrams ( rather than using the whole @xmath0-evolution machinery collected in  @xcite ) .",
    "particular attention has to be given to the question of possible cancellations between different contributions . as to the choice of input distributions",
    ", it seems advisable to make use of more specific , model dependent assumptions on the input distribution .",
    "the most reasonable starting point , in our opinion , is that model which has been most successful in describing the low-@xmath0 data of hera : the saturation model of  @xcite which contains only four free parameters .",
    "this model not only describes very well the @xmath12-cross section in the low @xmath0 transition region where the role of higher twist is of particular importance , but also allows to connect , in a quantitative way , the total cross section data with the dis inclusive diffractive process @xcite .",
    "a particular benefit of using this model is the interpretation in terms of qcd diagrams : comparing with the analysis of the qcd diagrams it is possible to read off a choice of twist - four initial conditions . since the model ( before doing any twist expansion ) describes the hera data , it is also likely to provide a realistic estimate of twist-4 contribution in the low-@xmath0 and small-@xmath1 region .",
    "+   + we begin with reviewing the expressions for the simplest qcd diagrams and discussing patterns of possible cancellations . in the following part we review the saturation model and",
    "define the twist expansion . in the third part",
    "we perform a numerical analysis and draw our conclusions on the the magnitude of gluonic twist-4 corrections .",
    "the results of our analysis are in qualitative agreement with the estimates presented in  @xcite , suggesting that twist-4 corrections to @xmath13 are small down to @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "however , we also find that this smallness is due to an almost complete cancellation of the twist-4 corrections to @xmath4 and @xmath3 : both of them , individually , are large , but have opposite signs and nearly the same magnitude . we interpret this as a warning against using the twist-2 formalism at too low @xmath0 and small @xmath1 .",
    "[ figure1 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    [ figure2 ]    \\(a ) ( b )    we are interested in twist-4 corrections @xmath16 to the transverse @xmath17 and longitudinal @xmath18 structure functions @xmath19 a qcd analysis of twist-4 corrections at small-@xmath1 starts from the lowest order diagrams shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the photon can have transverse or longitudinal polarization .",
    "approximate expressions for the fermion loop , @xmath20 can be found in  @xcite : they are valid for small @xmath1 , and corrections are of the order @xmath21 .",
    "the diagrams with two gluons start with leading twist , but they also contain higher twist - similar to the bfkl approximation which also contains corrections of all orders in @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , we have no way to obtain information on the higher - twist couplings to the proton .",
    "the diagrams with three gluons , through the reggeization of the gluon , are higher order corrections to the diagram with two gluons ; in the analysis of  @xcite they are needed to complete the covariant derivative of the two gluon diagram . in a complete twist-4 analysis these diagrams with two and three t - channel gluons have to be included , but presently we do not know how to estimate their magnitude . the most interesting twist four diagrams ,",
    "presumably , are the ones with four gluons .",
    "they belong to the four gluon operator which is expected to play the most crucial role at low @xmath0 and small @xmath1 .",
    "its coupling to the proton has been discussed in @xcite , where arguments have been given that the simplest model which respects the agk cutting rules consists of ( at least ) two pieces : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28-dependent , positive - valued functions which play the role of unintegrated gluon densities . combining them with the quark loop expressions , @xmath29 and retaining only those terms which give rise to @xmath0-logarithms , we arrive at the following twist-4 corrections to the transverse and longitudinal structure functions : @xmath30 \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and in comparison to @xcite .",
    "now , @xmath3 is twice the previous one to have @xmath13 ] @xmath32 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath28-dependence of initial conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be assumed to lead to a power - like behavior of the form @xmath35 where the exponent @xmath36 is unknown .",
    "thus , together with the @xmath22 suppression , these twist-4 corrections are of the form",
    "@xmath37 from this general observation one immediately sees that the value of @xmath0 where twist four becomes important is @xmath1-dependent .",
    "one of the most striking features is the sign structure : the transverse and longitudinal cross sections , ( [ deltafr ] ) and ( [ deltafrl ] ) , have opposite signs , and in @xmath38 one faces a strong cancellation . if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are of the same order of magnitude ( such that the square bracket expression is positive ) , we expect the twist-4 corrections to @xmath2 being slightly dominated by the negative corrections to @xmath3 , i.e. the higher twist corrections to @xmath2 could be small and negative .",
    "it is important to note that these corrections to the deep inelastic structure functions are closely related to the twist-4 corrections to the cross section of diffractive @xmath41 production ( the s - discontinuity line between gluon 2 and 3 ) .",
    "twist-4 in diffractive @xmath41 production has been observed experimentally , and it has to be a part of the twist-4 corrections to @xmath4 or @xmath3 .",
    "however , contrary to the most naive expectation , the two - gluon systems on both sides of this cutting line can not be restricted to be in color singlet states : the agk rules in perturbative qcd  @xcite require a structure of the form ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) , and from this one easily sees that the system of gluons 1 and 2 is not restricted to color singlet .",
    "turning to corrections of the form @xmath42 to fig .",
    "1 we face a mixing problem .",
    "in @xcite it has been argued , on the basis of an all - order analysis in the double - logarithmic approximation , that there are several gluonic twist-4 operators , four - gluon operators and one two gluon operators .",
    "they have different @xmath0-evolution equations , and they couple to the proton with different couplings .",
    "furthermore , they mix , i.e. there are transitions from two - gluon states in the t - channel to four - gluon states . when computing @xmath42 corrections to the diagrams in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we group the contributions in the form shown in fig .  2 : ( a ) illustrates the transition of the two - gluon state to the four - gluon state and leads to the correction @xmath43 , and ( b ) illustrates the first evolution step of the two - gluon operator and gives the correction to @xmath44 .",
    "the calculation of these diagrams is described in @xcite and leads to the following twist-4 contributions :    @xmath45    @xmath46      for low @xmath0-values it is not a priori clear whether these corrections to the twist-4 contributions are important or not : there is an additional suppression factor @xmath53 , and for low @xmath0-values the logarithm @xmath54 does not provides much enhancement .",
    "to get a first idea , it may , again , be useful to draw a connection with diffractive dissociation . as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) , these diagrams describe diffractive production of @xmath55 systems .",
    "there is no doubt that these diffractive states have been observed at hera : a direct analysis of their twist-4 component ( e.g. the observation of diffractive final states with only hard jets ) would provide a direct evidence for the presence of these higher twist corrections in the deep inelastic structure function .",
    "+   + a simple analysis of twist-4 corrections could be based upon the presented low - order expressions . however , even within this framework we need two initial conditions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . relating them to the twist-4 diffractive",
    "@xmath41 cross section ( as described in @xcite ) gives only one condition , and , hence , is not enough .",
    "we are therefore lead to build a model for the initial conditions .",
    "the most successful description of the low-@xmath0 transition region at hera has been provided by the saturation model of @xcite , and we will use this model to determine the initial conditions .",
    "let us first briefly review the model of @xcite and its decomposition into twist components .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath12-cross sections , @xmath58 can be written at small @xmath1 as @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the transverse and longitudinally polarized photon wave functions , and @xmath61 is the dipole cross section which describes the interaction of the @xmath41 pair with the proton . in addition , @xmath62 is the momentum fraction of the photon carried by the quark , and @xmath63 is the relative transverse separation between the quarks .",
    "the wave functions are solely determined by the coupling of the photon to the @xmath41 pair , see e.g. @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the dipole cross section is assumed to depend on @xmath1 through the ratio of the transverse separation @xmath63 and the saturation radius @xmath64 , and the following form is proposed : @xmath65 at small @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) , the dipole cross section grows quadratically with @xmath63 , @xmath67 , while for large @xmath63 ( @xmath68 ) , it saturates , @xmath69 . in order to describe the energy dependence both of the total dis cross sections and of the low-@xmath0 cross section measured at hera , the saturation radius has the following @xmath1-dependent form :    @xmath70    with @xmath71 .",
    "( [ sat1])-([sat3 ] ) define the saturation model .",
    "the physical motivation for such a parameterization and its significance for diffractive processes in dis is discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "the three parameters in the model are determined from a fit to the total dis cross section data at @xmath72 and look as follows : @xmath73  , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in this way a very good description of data in a broad range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is obtained .",
    "in fact there is a fourth parameter in the model , an effective quark mass @xmath76 in the photon wave function , chosen such that the results of the model , extended down to photoproduction region , are in a good agreement with photoproduction data measured at hera .    in order to evaluate the cross section ( [ sat1 ] )",
    "it is convenient to employ the mellin transform to factorize the wave function from the dipole cross section :    @xmath77    in the case of zero quark mass we obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79 in addition , @xmath80 in ( [ mellinint1 ] ) equals : @xmath81 for the saturation form of the dipole cross section @xmath82 . from relation ( [ mellinint1 ] ) we see that the cross sections @xmath83 depend on @xmath1 in the saturation model only through the combination @xmath84 notice that a similar combination , eq .",
    "( [ xdep4 ] ) , occurs in the twist-4 analysis in the previous section .",
    "[ figure3 ]    the detailed discussion in  @xcite ( which will not be repeated here ) shows that there is an essential change in the energy ( and also @xmath0 ) dependence of the cross section if we move from the `` perturbative '' region , @xmath85 ( large @xmath0 and not too small @xmath1 ) , to the nonperturbative `` pomeron '' region , @xmath86 ( small @xmath0 and very small @xmath1 ) . in the former region",
    "we have a power - like rise in @xmath87 ( in agreement with the observed rise of the structure function at small @xmath1 ) , whereas in the latter one the cross section stays constant ( apart from a logarithmic enhancement factor ) .",
    "hence the region @xmath88 ( see fig .  3 ) marks the transition from one region to the other . in the region",
    "@xmath85 it is natural to expand the inclusive cross sections in powers of @xmath89 ( which means powers of @xmath22 ) while in the region @xmath86 in powers of @xmath90 or @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear , however , that the expansion in powers of @xmath22 can not be valid down to @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , approaching the transition region @xmath88 from the perturbative side one expects the leading-@xmath89 approximation to fail somewhat to the right of the line @xmath92 ( called a critical line in @xcite ) .    with expressions ( [ mellinint1])-([mellinint2 ] )",
    "the above discussion can be made more precise .",
    "the expansion in powers of @xmath89 will be identified as `` twist expansion '' ( below we will explain why ) . the power series in @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 )",
    "is determined by the singularities of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ mellinint1 ] ) in the complex @xmath93-plane .",
    "these are single or multiple poles , located at @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath93-integration runs along the real axis , and for @xmath96 it is tempting to close the contour in the lower half - plane .",
    "a closer look reveals that in such a case an asymptotic expansion for our cross sections is constructed .",
    "this is done by computing residues of the poles in the lower half - plane which leads to an expansion in powers of @xmath89 or @xmath22 .",
    "now , the critical line ( or better , a strip ) indicates a limit on validity of the asymptotic twist expansion .",
    "it is also possible to close the contour in the upper half - plane in which case an convergent expansion in positive powers of @xmath90 or @xmath0 is obtained for any value of @xmath97 .",
    "however , this expansion is not practical in the large @xmath0 or small @xmath89 analysis .",
    "the first singularity encountered in the lower plane is a pole at @xmath98 . in the saturation model",
    "the transverse cross section has a double pole which generates a logarithmic behavior for the leading - twist contribution : @xmath99 the longitudinal leading - twist contribution has only a single pole and therefore does not produce a logarithm : @xmath100    higher - twist contributions can be obtained by evaluating the residues at the lower lying poles , the twist-4 contribution at the pole @xmath101 , etc .",
    "the results for the transverse contributions are : +   + twist-4 : @xmath102 twist-6 : @xmath103 twist-8 : @xmath104 for the longitudinal contributions we find : +   + twist-4 : @xmath105 twist-6 : @xmath106 twist-8 : @xmath107    it is not surprising to see a strong similarity between the twist-4 contributions ( [ deltafr ] ) and ( [ deltafrl ] ) computed to lowest order in qcd , and those found in the saturation model ( [ twist4 t ] ) and ( [ twist4l ] ) . in particular",
    ", the sign structure is the same : @xmath108 is positive while @xmath109 is negative .",
    "also , @xmath109 contains a logarithm while @xmath108 does not .",
    "finally , the ratio of the twist-4 contributions , @xmath110 is similar to the ratio obtained from the lowest order qcd calculation @xmath111    thus , the saturation model can be interpreted as a result of summing the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(c ) ( and more `` iterations of gluon ladders '' ) : the leading twist comes entirely from fig .",
    "1(a ) , twist four from fig .",
    "1(c ) etc . viewed in this way",
    ", the model can be used to define values of the initial conditions for ( [ deltafr ] ) and ( [ deltafrl ] ) , but only in the combination @xmath112 .",
    "the higher order corrections illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) are not included in the model .",
    "the success of the model might indicate that this type of corrections is not very important near the transition ( critical ) line ; but it may also be that a suitable modification of the model might be necessary .",
    "further insight will be gained through a numerical study .",
    "we choose to use the expressions of section 3 and compare the full expressions ( [ mellinint1 ] ) ( with @xmath113 ) , which can be integrated numerically , with the twist - expansion ( [ twist2t])-([twist8l ] ) .",
    "as far as the twist-4 terms alone are concerned , we could have started from the saturation model , extract the initial conditions and than turned to the qcd approximations listed in section 2 . for our present discussion , however , we find it more instructive to study the role of higher twist ( in particular , twist-4 ) in a more general context",
    ". the saturation model , which describes the data , provides an analytical formula for the cross sections and allows to investigate the twist expansion and its breakdown near @xmath92 . since the dependence upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 is through the variable @xmath89 , we present the numerical results as a function of @xmath89 .    in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] we show lines of constant @xmath89 ( @xmath114 ) : variation of @xmath89 means moving from one line to another . with the help of fig .",
    "3 @xmath89 can be translated into the @xmath1 and @xmath0 variables .",
    "we begin with presenting the ratios of the leading - twist approximations to the full cross sections as a function of @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the ratios for the transverse @xmath115 , longitudinal @xmath116 , and the total @xmath117 , cross sections .",
    "the striking result is that for both the transverse and longitudinal cross sections separately the higher twist corrections become large when we are approaching the transition line @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , the transverse higher twist correction is positive while the longitudinal one is negative . in the sum , however , those corrections almost cancel each other and the overall correction is small .",
    ".the mrst values of the higher - twist coefficient @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ mrstf2 ] ) [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this is a possible explanation of the smallness of the higher twist correction to @xmath2 found in the analysis of mrst @xcite . the authors of this analysis use the following simple parameterization : @xmath119 and determined the function @xmath118 from a fit to dis data .",
    "the result is given in table  1 which we reproduce from @xcite .",
    "in general , for small @xmath1 , @xmath118 is small and negative but it becomes positive for the smallest @xmath1 .",
    "we found a similar result , the leading twist approximation deviates from the exact formula by less than 10% .",
    "the sign structure of this deviation also agrees with the mrst analysis ; it is negative but to the left of the transition line the deviation becomes positive .",
    "the last result should be taken with some care since , strictly speaking , the twist expansion for @xmath86 in the saturation model makes no longer sense , and a new expansion in powers @xmath0 is appropriate .",
    "we extrapolated , however , the leading twist formula to that region and found an agreement with the exact result up to @xmath120 .",
    "this indicates that the phenomenological success of a leading - twist analysis might be deceptive : the leading - twist approximation to @xmath2 remains a good approximation also in the region in which the whole twist expansion has already collapsed .    the last point is also illustrated in fig .  5 where the individual higher twist components are shown .",
    "we plot @xmath121 for @xmath122 , together with the exact result ( solid line ) .",
    "the overall impression is that near @xmath92 all higher twist corrections are getting large , leading to the conclusion that the concept of higher twist becomes meaningless .",
    "if we naively extrapolate the higher twist formulas to the region @xmath86 they diverge .",
    "nevertheless , to the right of @xmath92 there is a region where twist 6 and 8 are small and can be neglected , whereas twist-4 accounts for the deviation between the twist-2 approximation and the exact result .",
    "6 illustrates this in another way : the sum of twist-2 and twist-4 provides a rather accurate description of the exact formula .",
    "in this region ( in fig.3 between the two lines @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) twist-4 corrections should improve the qcd description of deep inelastic scattering .    in fig .",
    "7 we present the results of the analysis performed only for the longitudinal twist contributions @xmath125 and @xmath122 .",
    "the striking result in comparison to the total cross section analysis is a large and negative twist-4 contribution which accounts for a large difference between the exact and leading twist result .",
    "this is shown in fig .  8 : again the sum of twist-2 and twist-4 provides an accurate description of the exact formula .",
    "notice that the difference @xmath126 is large already at @xmath127 .",
    "taking this result , we conclude that an analysis of the longitudinal structure functions @xmath3 based entirely on the leading twist result is unreliable already for quite high values of @xmath0 and not to small @xmath1 . a similar effect ,",
    "although not so pronounced , occurs for the transverse cross section ( large twist-4 corrections for the transverse case were also discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the role of higher twist in the longitudinal structure function was broadly studied in @xcite and a qualitatively similar results to ours were obtained there for small @xmath1 .    in summary ,",
    "the main lesson to be learned from this study is the cancellation of higher twist in @xmath2 : twist-4 is not small , neither in the transverse nor in the longitudinal part , but it is hardly visible in the sum of both because of the mutual cancellation .",
    "moreover , the twist-2 approximation to @xmath2 works even beyond @xmath92 where the whole concept of a twist expansion should make no sense . as far as @xmath3 is concerned , the leading twist significantly exceeds the exact result for @xmath128 , and a large and negative twist-4 correction is necessary to obtain an agreement with the exact result .",
    "in this article we have carried out a simple numerical analysis of gluonic twist-4 corrections in the low-@xmath0 , small-@xmath1 hera . we have reviewed what an analysis of lowest - order qcd diagrams suggests .",
    "one of the most striking features are differences in sign between transverse and longitudinal twist-4 corrections which may lead to a small twist-4 correction , even if the corrections to @xmath4 or @xmath3 are not small at all . because of the unknown initial conditions more input is needed .",
    "we then have used the saturation model which provides an excellent description of both @xmath2 and the dis diffractive cross section at hera , and we have analyzed its higher twist content .",
    "we found a one - to - one correspondence between the twist expansion of this model and the qcd diagrams discussed before .",
    "the model can therefore be used to define initial conditions of a qcd higher twist analysis .",
    "+   + in our numerical analysis we have restricted ourselves to a careful study of the saturation model .",
    "we found that , indeed , twist-4 corrections to @xmath2 remain small , and this smallness is due to an almost complete cancellation between large corrections to @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that although twist four corrections are small in @xmath2 , the use of the leading - twist dglap formalism for extracting structure functions becomes doubtful in the low-@xmath0 , small-@xmath1 hera region . within the saturation model",
    "we have quantified the limit of applicability .",
    "this problem is even more acute for @xmath3 alone , where the large twist-4 correction is directly exposed , providing a crucial contribution which brings the leading twist result close to the exact one",
    ". the dglap formalism might not be reliable in this case even for higher values @xmath1 and @xmath0 , see fig .  8 . +   + clearly , our numerical conclusions are based upon a specific model .",
    "the phenomenological success of this model provides some reasons to believe that the conclusions are realistic .",
    "moreover , on a qualitative level our conclusions are in agreement with the independent fit to the hera data of  @xcite . nevertheless , some uncertainty remains .",
    "we have outlined that in the saturation model some contributions are not present which one would expect to see when starting from qcd diagrams .",
    "if included they may modify the subtle balance between transverse and longitudinal structure function .",
    "they may also shift the transition region ( the `` transition line '' of the saturation model , in reality , may turn out to be a rather narrow `` transition strip '' ) .",
    "however , the coincidence with the mrst fit makes us feel that the conclusions of our analysis are `` not far from reality '' .",
