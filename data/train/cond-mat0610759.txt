    "the mechanism that causes the high - temperature superconductivity in the copper oxide materials ( cuprates ) is still unknown .",
    "as the charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) are introduced into the parent antiferromagnetic insulator , the material evolves from an insulator to a superconductor , and eventually to a normal metal .",
    "thus , the cuprate systems drastically change their behaviors depending on the carrier density in the two - dimensional cuo@xmath4 planes , which are the stage of the high-@xmath5 superconductivity and related low - energy physics .",
    "while the overdoped ( @xmath6 ) cuprates behave like a relatively conventional fermi liquid above @xmath5 , underdoped ( @xmath7 ) cuprates in the normal state show behaviors which are strongly deviated from those of a standard fermi liquid .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to know the detailed information about the doping evolution of the electronic structure of the cuo@xmath4 plane to understand the cuprate systems .    the recent remarkable development in the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) technique has enabled us to investigate fine spectral features near the chemical potential , which may be used to interpret the thermodynamic and transport properties of solids from a microscopic point of view .",
    "indeed , arpes studies on cuprate superconductors , largely on the bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath8 ( bi2212 ) family , have been performed extensively @xcite and revealed the normal - state electronic structure such as the dispersions of quasi - particle bands crossing the chemical potential , the presence of a pseudo - gap above @xmath0 and its @xmath9-wave like gap anisotropy in the underdoped region . on the other hand , bilayer splitting @xcite , bio - layer structural modulation , etc .",
    ", complicate the interpretation of the arpes spectra of bi2212 .    in order to avoid the above complications and to study the intrinsic doping dependence of the electronic structure over a much wider hole concentration range ,",
    "the la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) system is the most suitable one among the families of high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors .",
    "lsco has a simple crystal structure with single cuo@xmath4 layers , and no cu - o chains as in yba@xmath4cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ( ybco ) nor complicated structural modulation of the block layers as in bi2212 .",
    "the hole concentration in the cuo@xmath4 plane can be controlled over a wide range and uniquely determined by the sr concentration @xmath12 ( and the small oxygen non - stoichiometry ) .",
    "one can therefore investigate the doping dependence from the undoped insulator ( @xmath13 ) to the heavily overdoped metal ( @xmath14 ) in a single system .",
    "indeed , the most extensive set of data on the doping dependence of the transport and thermodynamic properties are available for the lsco system @xcite and can be in principle compared with arpes data .",
    "arpes studies of lsco had been behind those of bi2212 for some time due to the experimental difficulties in obtaining atomically flat surfaces by cleaving and to the relatively poor surface chemical stability .",
    "the first successful arpes study of lsco was performed by ino _",
    "they showed an overall feature of band dispersions and fermi surface , including a crossover from a hole - like to an electron - like fermi surface with hole doping @xcite .",
    "peculiar features such as an unusual suppression of the zone diagonal direction , which had not been observed in bi2212 , were also reported in @xcite and subsequently by zhou _",
    "in addition , so - called  two - component \" behavior , namely , the coexisting remnant lower hubbard band and quasi - particle band with the chemical potential pinned within the charge - transfer gap , have been observed in the underdoped region @xcite .",
    "those unconventional behaviors were discussed in terms of microscopic charge inhomogeneity or the spin - charge fluctuations in a stripe form @xcite , which has been suggested from incommensurate peaks in the inelastic neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the apparent  two - component \" behaviors in the arpes line shapes have been interpreted by the strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite .    because of the weakness of the nodal spectral weight , concerns about the sample surface quality had persisted .",
    "also , there were questions about the effects of photoemission matrix elements @xcite , which makes it difficult to extract quantitative information about the stripe effects from comparison between experiment and theoretical studies which predicted the suppression of spectral weight in the nodal direction @xcite .",
    "however , recent arpes studies on lsco have revealed that under a suitable experimental geometry , a quasi - particle ( qp ) band with a clear kink feature crosses the fermi level ( @xmath15 ) in the nodal ( 0,0)-(@xmath16,@xmath16 ) direction @xcite even down to the lightly doped region @xcite .",
    "it has also been established that the fermi surface is basically large @xcite and that the ( @xmath16,0 ) region remains ( pseudo ) gapped , leading to the electronic state in which only part of the fermi surface survives as an  arc \" around the nodal direction .",
    "such a large fermi surface picture with the pseudogap has been theoretically studied both from rvb @xcite and fermi liquid approach @xcite . in this papar",
    ", we present a large set of arpes spectra of lsco showing the qp structure or the pseudogap feature on the entire fermi surface , and compare the arpes spectra with the transport and thermodynamic properties in the entire doping range .",

    "furthermore , although the fermi surface seen by arpes is large , the carrier density @xmath22 deduced from the hall coefficient @xmath19 @xcite and the superfluid density @xmath23 from magnetic - field penetration depth @xcite measurements decrease with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the carrier number @xmath22 appears to be given by the hole concentration @xmath12 rather than the band filling @xmath24 in the underdoped region @xcite .",
    "these unconventional behavior may be attributed to the pseudogap opening through which a portion of the fermi surface becomes gapped above @xmath0 .",
    "the pseudogap opening provides a natural scenario to the long - standing issue of how the electronic structure evolves with hole doping from the mott insulator to the superconductor in two - dimensional systems .",
    "these features shall be described by the recent high - quality arpes data of lsco as described below .",
    "the arpes measurements were carried out at beamline 10.0.01 of advanced light source ( als ) and beamline 5 - 4 of stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory ( ssrl ) , using incident photons with energies of 55.5 ev and 22.4 ev , respectively .",
    "scienta ses-2002 ( als ) and ses-200 ( ssrl ) spectrometers were used in the angle mode .",
    "the total energy resolutions were about 15 mev ( ssrl ) to 20 mev ( als ) .",
    "high - quality single crystals of lsco were grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone method .",

    "this measurement geometry enhances dipole matrix elements in this @xmath26 region @xcite .",
    "one of the central issues in the field of high @xmath0 cuprates is how an antiferromagnetic insulator evolves with hole doping .",

    "these anomalies indicate a potential deviation from the standard migdal - eliashberg theory and the possibility of a complex interplay between electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",

    "the difference is most pronounced at low doping where the coupling is strong . in this case , the edc - derived velocity exhibits considerable doping dependence . while for weakly interacting systems mdc and edc are expected to yield similar dispersion relations from linearly dispersing bands , strong coupling features which cause substantial renomaliations may cloud edc and mdc analysis .",
    "the origin of the difference between mdc and edc - derived dispersions remains a matter to be further explored .      in conventional superconductors ,",
    "the successful extraction of the phonon spectral function , or the eliashberg function , @xmath65 , from electron tunneling data played a decisive role in cementing the consensus on the phonon - mediated mechanism of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "for high temperature superconductors , the extraction of the bosonic spectral function can provide fingerprints for more definitive identification of the nature of bosons involved in the coupling .    in principle , the ability to directly measure the dispersion , and therefore , the electron self - energy , would make arpes the most direct way of extracting the bosonic spectral function .",

    "quantitatively , however , the @xmath95 values show a difference of factor @xmath425 , implying that the effective density of superconducting electrons is reduced compared with the nominal carrier number even in the overdoped region .",
    "also , note that the superfluid density becomes finite only for @xmath96 , while that estimated from arpes shows finite value even in @xmath12=0.03 .",
    "another viewpoint to explain the reduced superfluid density is to attribute it to the reduced qp spectral weight @xmath97 rather than the enhanced @xmath93 @xcite , which also explain the doping dependence of @xmath98 [ see fig.[edc](c ) ] .",
    "the overall quantitative difference may come from the effect of @xmath97 .",
    "because of the pseudo - gap opening around ( @xmath16,0 ) , the electronic states around the node mainly contribute to the in - plane transport properties in the underdoped region . here , we have attempted to estimate the in - plane electrical resistivity from the observed mdc width @xmath99 [ fig .

    "the mdc width at the chemical potential is plotted in fig .",
    "[ resistivity](a ) as a function of fermi - surface angle @xmath86 .",
    "one can see that the width around the node ( @xmath86=45@xmath106 ) depends on doping only weakly , which is consistent with the weak doping dependence of the charge mobility @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "using the data in fig .",
    "[ resistivity](a ) , the doping dependence of the in - plane electrical resistivity @xmath108 was estimated by applying the drude formula with @xmath102 and the nodal mdc width , and the boltzmann formula with and without the fermi arc .",
    "then , they are compared with the transport results @xcite in fig . [ resistivity](b ) .    in all the @xmath108 estimated from arpes , the discrepancy from the transport data is pronounced in the over doped region .",
    "the discrepancy stems from the wide mdc widths compared to that expected from the transport results in the overdoped region , which may be due to the effects of vertex correction , the possible dominance of forward scattering @xcite in the overdoped region and/or the finite instrumental resolution neglected in the present analysis . on the other hand , in the underdoped region ,",
    "the @xmath108 estimated from arpes including the effects of  fermi arc \" or assuming @xmath102 is in good agreement with the transport results , while that evaluated using the entire fermi surface is by more than one order of magnitude smaller than the transport data .",
    "this suggests that the pseudogap is the origin of the small carrier number and hence the high electrical resistivity of the underdoped samples . as a whole ,",
    "the @xmath108 values estimated from arpes with the fermi arc well explains the doping dependence of the transport data of the underdoped lsco .",
    "incommensurate peaks seen in the neutron scattering experiments of lsco @xcite have been discussed as a signature of the spin - charge fluctuations in a stripe form @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to explain the incommensurability from the shape of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "recently , the qp interference has been observed in the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) study of bi2212 @xcite . in another stm study ,",
    "the observed features were discussed in connection with the stripe feature @xcite .",
    "the qp interference has been explained by the autocorrelations of the arpes intensity map in momentum space @xcite .",
    "therefore , we applied the autocorrelation analysis to the present arpes results of lsco and found that neutron scattering peak intensity @xmath109 can be approximately expressed by the autocorrelation formula @xmath110 as shown in fig .",
    "[ income ] .",
    "although this formula may not be sufficient for correlated electron systems , autocorrelation analysis may give some insight into the problem of the incommensurability .",
    "figure [ income ] ( b ) shows that the obtained incommensurability increases with hole doping , although there are quantitative deviation from the neutron results . also , it should be noted that neutron scattering for @xmath12=0.03 shows diagonal peaks whereas our incommensurate peaks remained vertical . in the present autocorrelation model",
    ", such an increase of the incommensurability can be attributed to the decreasing fermi momentum @xmath37 measured from the @xmath111 point with hole doping [ fig . [ kf](b ) ] , since the incommensurability is given by the momentum vector connecting nearly parallel part of the fermi surface around the node , as shown in the fig .",
    "[ income](c ) .",
    "the antinodal region does not contribute to the autocorrelation function because spectral weight in that region is very small due to the pseudogap opening .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath112 ordering observed in na - ccoc @xcite may be related to the nesting vector @xmath113 connecting the fermi surface near ( @xmath16,0 ) @xcite .",
    "the calculated peak width are broadened in the overdoped @xmath12=0.22 , which is also consistent with the neutron results .",
    "the present analysis suggests that the shape of the fermi surface of lsco with small @xmath51 may have a nesting instability of the observed incommensurability . on the quantitative level , however , the obtained incommensurability is a little different from the stripe picture , and therefore further analysis with more sophisticated models will be needed to address the stripe issue .",
    "we have performed a systematic arpes study of the high-@xmath0 cuprates lsco from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metal .",
    "the doping dependence of the ( underlying ) fermi surfaces , the qp band dispersion and the pseudogap behaviors were studied in detail .",
    "we observed a doping dependence of the tb parameter @xmath51 , which is consistent with the lda calculation , which takes into account the effect of apical oxygen , as well as with the cdmft calculation , which takes into account the increased electron correlation with decreasing hole concentration . also , the fermi surface deduced using mdc s was found to approximately fulfill luttinger s sum rule even down to the lightly - doped region @xcite .    as for the qp spectral feature , in the underdoped region ,",
    "apparent two - component behaviors occurs with the chemical potential pinning @xcite .",
    "the fermi velocity was nearly doping independent @xcite and the spectral weight of the nodal qp increased with hole doping .",
    "the length of the fermi arc increased with hole doping .",
    "the relationship between the large pseudo gap and the singularity in the dos caused by the flat band feature is discussed .",
    "the small pseudo gap observed around ( @xmath16,0 ) was found to be consistent with other experimental data .    finally , by using the information from the arpes results , we have successfully reproduced the qualitative behavior of the thermodynamic and transport properties of lsco . in the analysis",
    ", we demonstrated that the pseudogap and the fermi arc feature observed by arpes can explain the unconventional doping dependence of the thermodynamic and transport properties of lsco .",
    "although the analysis using the arpes data can qualitatively explain many physical properties of the underdoped lsco , quantitative discrepancies remain to be explained .",
    "obviously the definition of the fermi arc and its length is rather loose and only approximate at the present stage , and will have to be further examined on a firm ground . also , the origin of the difference between of lsco and other cuprate families such as na - ccoc remains to be understood .",

    "<S> we have performed a systematic angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) study of the high-@xmath0 cuprates la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , ranging from the underdoped insulator to the superconductor to the overdoped metal . </S>",
    "<S> we have revealed a systematic doping evolution of the band dispersions and ( underlying ) fermi surfaces , pseudogap and quasi - particle features under the influence of strong electron - electron interaction and electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the unusual transport and thermodynamic properties are explained by taking into account the pseudogap opening and the fermi arc formation , due to which the carrier number decreases as the doped hole concentration decreases . </S>"
