    "sulphur dioxide is an attractive molecular system which combines a very small system size with many different excited states coupled in a complex way , offering a challenging photodynamics which can be studied with ultra - fast , time - resolved spectroscopic methods and modern high - level ab initio techniques .    in a companion paper,@xcite",
    "( hereafter referred to as paper i ) the experimental and theoretical efforts of the last 80  years to characterize the electronic excited states of have been surveyed in detail . already in the 1930s,@xcite high - resolution absorption spectra of were recorded .",
    "the absorption spectrum features three prominent bands in the near- and medium - uv range , named the forbidden band and the first and second allowed bands.@xcite especially the first allowed band between 3.6  ev and 5.1  ev was subject to numerous analyses ( reviewed by herzberg@xcite and heicklen et al.@xcite ) because of its intricate structure . from a modern point of view , this band system arises from the transition from the ground state to the vibronically coupled @xmath0 system ( the two lowest excited singlet states ) . mller and kppel@xcite treated this singlet state system using full - dimensional quantum dynamics ( qd ) and found that the system remains primarily on the lower adiabatic potential energy surface ( pes ) after excitation .",
    "an extension of this study has been published very recently.@xcite    however , there is significant evidence@xcite that the excited state dynamics within the first allowed band system is also affected by the presence of triplet states .",
    "shows in the region between 3.1  ev and 3.6  ev a weak absorption profile ( the forbidden band ) , which was shown to arise from excitation to triplet states by douglas@xcite by means of the zeeman effect .",
    "even though the number , location and character of the triplet states could not be determined by early spectroscopic means , modern ab initio methods showed that three states of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 symmetry are present at energies slightly lower than the corresponding singlet states .",
    "consequently , intersystem crossing ( isc ) between singlet and triplet states could be plausible and the photodynamics of might be influenced by both isc and internal conversion ( ic ) processes .",
    "very recently , both spectroscopic@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies suggested that in a number of systems isc indeed can compete with ic on an ultrafast time scale . in order to provide more evidence for these new findings ,",
    "several experimental methods based on high - resolution time - resolved spectroscopy have been developed.@xcite further experimental indications for the case of can be found in paper i.    in the present paper , we attempt to unravel the excited state dynamics of theoretically . to this aim ,",
    "ab initio surface hopping molecular dynamics ( md ) is employed using the sharc code.@xcite sharc ( surface hopping including arbitrary couplings ) can treat ic and isc , mediated by non - adibatic couplings and spin - orbit couplings , respectively , on the same footing .",
    "this is achieved by performing surface hopping in a basis of spin - orbit - coupled electronic states , which are obtained by diagonalization of the potential energy matrix including the spin - orbit couplings .",
    "the simulations are focused on the energy range corresponding to the forbidden and first allowed band of the experimental absorption spectrum.@xcite the applicability of sharc on is validated by running also trajectories on the singlet - manifold only , whose results are compared with those obtained by mller and kppel using accurate quantum dynamical ( qd ) calculations.@xcite other applications of sharc can be found in refs .  .",

    "also in this region the spin - orbit couplings amount to about 30  @xmath63 and allow for a noteworthy isc yield . since in this part of the pes @xmath56 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 all become very close in energy , simultaneous isc to @xmath41 and @xmath42 becomes possible .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , both transitions @xmath71 and @xmath72 contribute to the spectrum to a similar extent .",
    "the resulting calculated absorption spectrum is in reasonable agreement with the experimental one , although small deviations are patent .",
    "first , the calculated overall band shape is slightly red - shifted , by approximately 0.1  ev .",
    "this may be attributed to the double - zeta quality of the basis set since preliminary calculations indicate that larger basis sets give slightly higher excitation energies for all considered excited states . despite its lesser accuracy ,",
    "the double - zeta basis set was employed for the sake of computational performance during the dynamics .",
    "second , while the high - energy slopes of both spectra are quite similar , the low - energy slope of the calculated spectrum features too high intensities . in the experimental spectrum , at around 3.8  ev",
    "the absorption is already close to zero , while in the calculated spectrum the slope extends until 3.5  ev .",
    "it is noteworthy that the experimental @xmath93-@xmath93 transition for this band has been located at around 3.46  ev,@xcite so the obtained excitation energies are plausible and only the intensities are overestimated .    finally , it is obvious that the vibrational structure of the spectrum is not reproduced by our simulation .",
    "a description of this phenomenon goes beyond of the scope of this work , since it requires a quantum - mechanical treatment of the nuclear motion .",
    "a semi - classical simulation can not account for quantization of the vibrational energy levels and also is not able to deliver nuclear wavefunction overlaps , which are necessary to obtain franck - condon factors .",
    "thus , a correct calculation of the total absorption is not possible within this approach .",
    "the absence of the franck - condon factors might also explain the too intense low - energy slope in the calculated spectrum .    in conclusion ,",
    "given the employed theoretical model , the simulated spectrum is in good agreement with the experiment and confirms the correctness of the initial conditions .      a good agreement is obtained between the qd simulation by mller and kppel@xcite and our singlet - only md simulations ( recall figure  [ fig : population_sonly ] ) .",
    "right after excitation , the states @xmath56 and @xmath40 briefly interact while still in proximity to the ci .",
    "however , already after ca 10  fs the population on @xmath56 has moved sufficiently far away from the ci to cease @xmath94 population transfer .",
    "afterwards , only the @xmath40 population stays close to the interaction region , since the cone focusses the population on the intersection .",
    "consequently , between 10  fs and 60  fs a decay from @xmath40 to @xmath56 is found . at 60  fs ,",
    "the @xmath40 surface is completely depopulated in both qd and md simulations .",
    "the use of casscf in the qd simulation and of mrci in the md simulation lead to differences in the potentials slopes , non - adiabatic coupling strengths and the exact location of the ci . already katagiri et al.@xcite noticed that the casscf method gives unsatisfactorily flat potentials of the @xmath56 state near the dissociation limit . on the contrary ,",
    "the dissociation energy as obtained on the mrci level of theory ( about 5.8  ev ) is very close to the experimental one at 5.65  ev .",
    "the small discrepancies in the populations of the two simulations can be explained in this way .",
    "after 70  fs ( qd ) or 80  fs ( md ) , the population on the @xmath56 surface returns to the @xmath56/@xmath40 intersection area in the franck - condon region . at this point",
    ", the @xmath40 is partly repopulated , though the initial population is not reached in both simulation types .",
    "this is reasonable in the sense that the ensemble already exhibits a considerable spread and the ci is missed by part of the ensemble .    in both studies",
    ", the wavepacket / ensemble basically moves all the time in @xmath56 , despite having sufficient energy to reach the @xmath40 .",
    "this behaviour can be attributed to the wavepacket / ensemble avoiding the ci because of the surrounding double - minimum potential ( see figure  [ fig : pes_all ] ) .",
    "following the potential energy gradient , the wavepacket / ensemble moves into regions of @xmath95 , where the two surfaces avoid each other and the non - adiabatic coupling is small .",
    "also , both studies show that for times after 80  fs a coherent motion is virtually lost .",
    "note that the experiment ( see paper i ) indicates a long - lived coherent motion .",
    "although we could only speculate about the reasons for this disagreement in the qd case , we attribute the discrepancies between experiment and our md results to our approximate mrci gradients ( see section  [ ssec : gradients ] ) .",
    "we are aware of the shortcomings of these gradients , however , mrci potentials are necessary to qualitatively the dynamics and these gradients are the best approximation currently available compatible with the sharc methodology .    to sum up the findings so far , it is shown that the semi - classical dynamics gives results in satisfying agreement with the quantum dynamical results of mller and kppel . both show a high population of @xmath56 at all times , with a fraction of the population oscillating between the two surfaces .",
    "one of the most important results of this study is that the inclusion of triplet states leads to a completely different picture than that obtained in the singlet - only dynamics .",
    "isc plays a significant role in the deactivation of and , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : population_st ] , isc even competes with ic on a timescale of tens of femtoseconds .",
    "experimental results of paper  i ( figure  6  ( d ) ) also hint at the participation of isc in the ultrafast dynamics of .",
    "the differences between the singlet - only and the singlet - triplet dynamics are discussed in detail in the following .",
    "already during the first 5  fs , in the singlet - only dynamics there is considerable population transfer between @xmath56 and @xmath40 close to the ci , while in the singlet - triplet simulation this exchange is almost absent . instead , the @xmath56 population approaches the intersection with @xmath43 very fast and a large number of trajectories hop to the triplet surface .",
    "the presence of @xmath43 also governs the fate of @xmath40 at later times . in the singlet - only simulation , @xmath40",
    "is repopulated each time @xmath56 returns to the franck - condon region since the @xmath40/@xmath56 ci located there . in the singlet - triplet simulation",
    ", the @xmath56/@xmath43 intersection completely surrounds the ci and all trajectories returning to the franck - condon region have to pass through the singlet - triplet intersection .",
    "this leads to @xmath43 scavenging a large amount of incoming trajectories which could otherwise repopulate @xmath40 .",
    "it is mainly this mechanism which prevents @xmath40 from contributing significantly at later times .",
    "however , the inclusion of the triplet states has its greatest impact on the dynamics on @xmath56 .",
    "this state acts as the central hub in the dynamics and directly interacts with all other excited states under consideration .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the singlet - only case , the @xmath56 is heavily depleted by isc .",
    "the large number of trajectories showing isc can be rationalized by the fact that the @xmath56 interacts with the triplets over a wide range of geometries , while the singlet - singlet interaction is significant only in a very localized area ( the ci ) .",
    "the analysis of the net hops between the surfaces , presented in figure  [ fig : net_hops_early ] , has been summarized in a global scheme ( figure  [ fig : processes ] ) that collects the processes encountered in the photorelaxation dynamics of .",
    "each state is represented by a box , indicating also its respective initial population .",
    "the @xmath73 is absent from the figure , since relaxation to the ground state is unlikely in the time scales we are considering here .",
    "the population transfer events have been divided into two sets . in the first set",
    " the early transfers happening during the first 100  fs  mostly temporally localized events occur ( solid arrows in the figure ) , while for later times we see the continuous population transfers ( dashed arrows ) of the second set .",
    "the temporal localization is caused by the trajectories moving collectively and passing jointly through the different interaction regions .",
    "for each localized transfer event , the effective time constant @xmath85 , the onset of this process and the percentage of the total population transferred in this event is given next to the corresponding solid arrow .",
    "only major events are indicated .",
    "it is immediately obvious that @xmath56 interacts with all other excited states .",
    "it can also be seen that isc and ic start instantly and consequently , both mechanisms act on an ultrafast timescale .    ,",
    "the onset ( in bold ) and the total population transferred during this process . dashed arrows denote population transfer after the first 100  fs , where the labels give the rate of transfer.[fig : processes ] ]    after approximately 100  fs , the ensemble of trajectories is considerably spread across the surfaces and therefore temporally localized events are not observed anymore .",
    "instead , we find a continuous transfer of population among a subset of the considered states .",
    "circular population transfer between @xmath56 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 leads to a dynamical equilibrium . to a lesser extent",
    ", @xmath41 also contributes to the dynamical equilibrium by the alternative cycle @xmath96 .    in view of the occurrence of localized transfer events and the mentioned circular transfer ,",
    "a description of the whole dynamics by means of overall exponential fits is not suitable in the case of the relaxation dynamics in .",
    "another very interesting feature of , already noted in subsection  [ ssec : dynamics ] with regard to figure  [ fig : motion ] , is the division of the considered pess into two classes of pess .",
    "states @xmath56 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are characterized by a strong excitation of the asymmetric stretch mode because of their double - minimum potentials .",
    "on the contrary , the pess of @xmath40 and @xmath43 do not allow any asymmetric stretch .",
    "what is most interesting about these two observations is that the nuclear motion , i.e.  the vibrational frequency , does not allow for the identification of the populated electronic state .",
    "this fact may help to explain the experimental difficulty@xcite to observe the triplet states throughout decades of spectroscopic research .",
    "in states @xmath56 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , some trajectories show asymmetric stretch oscillations ( figure  [ fig : motion ] ( a ) ) exclusively in one of the wells of the double - minimum potential ( from @xmath19=0.0 to around 0.4    and back ) with a period of about 70  fs .",
    "another portion of the ensemble overcomes the central barrier and oscillates in both wells ( from @xmath19=-0.4 to + 0.4   ) , with a full - cycle period of 140  fs .",
    "interestingly , the oscillation period of 70  fs is also found in the symmetric stretch and bending modes ( figure  [ fig : motion ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "accordingly , the ensemble returns to the franck - condon region after this time interval and similarly at multiples of 70  fs .    from the spacing of the clement s bands in the absorption spectrum@xcite ( approximately 28  mev )",
    "one would expect a recurrence time of 148  fs .",
    "this time coincides with the asymmetric oscillation period across both potential wells found in the simulation , but is about double the first recurrence time of the ensemble in the franck - condon region .",
    "our recurrence time of about 70  fs would lead to a spacing of 59  mev , which could in principle be hidden under the peaks spaced by 28  mev . in order to recover the relative experimental peak heights in the spectrum",
    ", the second recurrence needs to be more pronounced than the first one .",
    "we do not observe such a behavior .",
    "the reason is possibly that the ensemble is already too strongly dispersed prior to the second recurrence due to our approximate gradients .",
    "we believe that the oscillation period of 70  fs is correct , but is only due to a partial recurrence to the franck - condon region .",
    "consequently , the expected peaks in the trpepico ( time - resolved photoelectron photoion coincidence ) spectra of paper i might be hidden under the peaks corresponding to the 140  fs period . the full recurrence after these 140  fs is underestimated in our dynamics most probably because of the approximate gradients .",
    "our rationale is supported by the findings of leveque _ _ et al.__@xcite published very recently . in their remarkable study , they discuss the role of the different spectroscopic states in detail and are able to achieve almost quantitative agreement with the experimental spectrum for the first time .",
    "this work is  to the best of our knowledge  the first ab initio - based dynamics study to investigate the singlet - triplet interactions in sulphur dioxide .",
    "the comparison with singlet - only results from qd and ab initio md reveals that the inclusion of the triplet states is essential in order to understand the photodynamics of this system . due to the presence of singlet - triplet intersections at accessible sites on the pess , not only ultrafast isc processes have been found , but those strongly influence the singlet - singlet interaction .",
    "after the initial delta pulse excitation , 80% of all trajectories start in the @xmath56 state and 20% in @xmath40 . while @xmath40 quickly decays to @xmath56 via a @xmath40/@xmath56 ci , in @xmath56",
    "the asymmetric stretch mode is strongly excited .",
    "this stretching of the bonds leads the trajectories inevitably through the intersection regions @xmath56/@xmath43 and slightly later @xmath56/@xmath41/@xmath42 .",
    "spin - orbit couplings on the order of 30  @xmath63 are responsible for an efficient and ultrafast isc in the regions of near - degeneracy .",
    "isc together with ic between the triplet states is responsible for the establishment of a dynamical equilibrium after 100  fs .",
    "there , @xmath56 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 exchange population circularly , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 remain mostly static .",
    "the occurrence of isc in our md simulation fits nicely with the observation of signals attributed to quartett states in decay associated spectra in paper i.    it was also found that the pess of @xmath56 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 on one hand and @xmath40 and @xmath43 on the other hand are sufficiently similar to cause indistinguishable molecular motion on these surfaces .",
    "this may explain the difficulties encountered in spectroscopic experiments to identify the participation of triplet states in the excited - state dynamics of .",
    "we observed a dominant oscillation period of 70  fs in our simulation , which was related to the spacing of the clement s bands in the experimental absorption spectrum and the trpepico spectra in paper i.    thus we have shown that our recently developed ab initio molecular dynamics program sharc@xcite can provide significant insight into complex molecular processes including states of different multiplicities .",
    "we deeply thank horst kppel and our collaboration partners iain wilkinson , albert stolow and serguei patchkowskii for many fruitful discussions .",
    "generous allocation of computer time at the vienna scientific cluster ( vsc2 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
