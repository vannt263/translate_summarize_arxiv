    "the main endeavor of heavy ion collision experiments is to study the nature of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at extreme physical conditions . in these experiments ,",
    "variety of colliding species has been used at various beam energies to understand the different aspects of qcd medium  @xcite .",
    "for example hadron - hadron collisions provides us the basic scattering cross - sections for various charged hadron productions .",
    "hadron - nucleus interactions quantify the nuclear effects on this production cross - sections and finally nucleus - nucleus collisions can shed light on the effect of various phases of qcd matter on the particle production processes .",
    "further , the change in collision energy is to study the strongly interacting matter in various physical conditions e.g. , at high temperature and zero chemical potential or at high chemical potential and zero temperature or at moderate temperature and chemical potential etc . even in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "various nuclei have been used to study other properties of qcd and related phases .",
    "for example , cu - au collision is a good tool to study the electromagnetic and chiral magnetic behavior of qcd matter due to a sizable amount of directed flow arises in these collisions  @xcite .",
    "au - au and pb - pb collisions are useful to study the phase transitions and the behavior of exotic phases of strongly interacting matter . in recent years collision among uranium nucleus has gained a lot of interest because of their non - spherical geometry which is actually prolate  @xcite .",
    "the deformed nuclei like @xmath9 promise additional gain of energy density compared to spherical nuclei at relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "the properties of qgp characterized by the observables like elliptic flow , jet quenching , charmonium suppression and multiplicity can be better understood by the collision of deformed uranium nuclei due to its initial geometry and specific orientation  @xcite .",
    "the collision of uranium nuclei can provide a reliable tool for the detection of chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite .",
    "the main hurdle to detect the cme signal reliably is the background effect of same strength generated due to elliptic flow . in spherical nuclei ,",
    "it is difficult to disentangle both these effect since the strength of both the signals generated from elliptic flow and cme is of similar strength in peripheral collisions .",
    "however , in @xmath0 central collisions , the different geometrical orientations can provide a way to subtract the background signal from cme signal due to a measurable difference in their strength .",
    "thus central collisions of u - u nuclei in tip - tip configuration can possibly be a good tool to characterize the signal of cme  @xcite .    in case of central body - body collisions ,",
    "the eccentricity is of the order of @xmath10 , almost as large as in the semicentral @xmath8 at @xmath11 fm where the maximum density is much lower  @xcite .",
    "therefore the body - body configuration of @xmath0 collisions allows to study the elliptic flow with higher density at given beam energy  @xcite .",
    "further dependence of energy loss of partons on path length and medium density is not yet fully understood since the fireball size created in @xmath8 collision is small and thus the difference in path length for the parton traversing in - plane and out - of - plane is small .",
    "different geometrical configurations of u - u collisions may provide almost twice as much difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane path lengths for the same eccentricities as semicentral @xmath8 collisions and thus provide a better opportunity to understand the energy loss mechanism  @xcite .",
    "deformed nuclei like uranium , having five independent parameters : impact parameter and four polar angles instead of one impact parameter as in the case of spherical nuclei , can provide in - depth knowledge of charged hadron production and collision dynamics of qcd matter  @xcite . in the case of @xmath12 , nuclear effects like shadowing , absorption etc .",

    ". different orientations of @xmath0 interactions could study nuclear effects with reduced uncertainty and provide an additional check on the models which successfully describing the @xmath8 data regarding @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "further it has been suggested that central @xmath0 collision in the body - body configuration ( a high baryon density system ) represents an optimum system to study the quark - hadron phase transition in its beam energy dependence  @xcite .",
    "a lot of effort has been taken to simulate and analyze the charged particle distributions in deformed u - u collisions ranging from fixed target experiments e.g. super proton sychrotron ( sps ) to collider experiment like rhic .",
    "most of these models are based on wounded nucleon approach  @xcite .",
    "however , in this article , we study the particle production in a wounded quark approach which assumes quark - quark interaction as the basic entity in defining the nucleus - nucleus interaction .",
    "we have shown in our earlier publications that this phenomenological model can describes the multiplicity distribution data simultaneously for various types of symmetric and asymmetric collisions at all the centralities ranging for most - peripheral to most - central  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to investigate whether a wounded quark approach can give reliable prediction of charged hadron production in deformed uranium nuclei collisions and provide the estimate for observables in various initial geometrical configurations . here",
    ", we have extended our modified version of wqm  @xcite with minimal number of parameters to explain and predict the charged hadron distributions with various controlling parameters in deformed @xmath0 collisions for each centrality at a colliding energy of @xmath13 gev .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we have presented the description of two - component wqm using suitable nuclear charge density function for uranium nucleus along with description of participating wounded quarks and binary quark - quark collisions . finally in section",
    "iv we shown the results obtained within wqm and their comparison with the corresponding experimental data , also with scaling with @xmath7 data and energy density estimation .",
    "finally we have discussed and summarized our present analysis .",
    "in the heavy ion collision experiment it is very important to estimate temperature and energy density of qcd medium , the information carried out very well by charged hadron pseudorapidity distribution . in recent publications",
    "@xcite , we have proposed a parametrization for the pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons produced in @xmath7 collisions based on the multiparton exchange as considered in additive quark model ( aqm )  @xcite . the basic theme of our model can be described in three points : ( 1 ) one , two or three gluons have been exchanged between a quark of the first nucleus or hadron with the quarks belonging to the other nucleus or hadron .",

    "( 3 ) the color tubes thus formed finally break - up into new hadrons and/or quark - antiquark pairs . in the present model ,",
    "the midrapidity pseudorapidity data by accommodating new data coming from @xmath7 collisions at 0.9 , 1.8 , and 7 tev energies  @xcite can be estimated from the following parametrization : @xmath14 we have obtained the values of the parameters as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite is the leading particle effect and arises due to the energy carried away by the spectator quarks and its experimental value determined as @xmath19 . the first term which remains constant with respect to collision energy",
    "is shown in fig . 1 and arises due to single gluon exchange between the wounded quark of target and projectile .",

    "our model result for minimum bias configuration suitably matches with the experimental data of the same configuration for all centrality intervals . the multiplicity is larger for tip - tip and body - tip configuration in central and semi - central collisions due to higher compression and a longer passage time of the reaction .",
