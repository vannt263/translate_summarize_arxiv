    "semiconductor quantum dots are often referred to as `` artificial atoms '' owing to their discrete energy spectrum .",
    "the progress in nanotechnology has made it possible to employ quantum dots as a _ sui generis _",
    "solid state laboratory for studies of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "interband optical pumping of quantum dots gives rise to the electron - hole pairs or zero - dimensional excitons , which , as shown in the pioneering works  @xcite , can strongly couple with the photon trapped in the optical microcavity .",
    "the strong coupling effect results in a coherent energy transfer between the photon and the exciton , this phenomenon is widely studied for bulk materials and planar quantum well structures  @xcite .",
    "its observation in zero - dimensional systems has attracted an enormous excitement of the research community since the concepts of quantum electrodynamics were directly transferred to the solid state .",
    "such quantum - dot - in - a - cavity systems demonstrate fascinating fundamental physics  @xcite and may be advantageous for quantum optics device applications  @xcite .",
    "the physical concept of the strong coupling in zero - dimensional microcavities can be easily understood considering , for the sake of an example , two classical pendulums with close frequencies of oscillations @xmath0 and @xmath1 connected by a spring , which induces the coupling between the pendulums of a strength @xmath2 . one of these oscillators represents a photon , the other one stands for an exciton , and the spring describes radiative recombination of the exciton into the photon mode . if the dampings of the individual oscillators are small compared with the coupling constant , the eigenfrequencies @xmath3 of this interacting system follow from the simple equation @xmath4 as @xmath5 the normal modes correspond to the coupled oscillations : by exciting one pendulum one eventually excites another , so the energy is transferred back and forth between them .",
    "the analogy between the quantum electrodynamical problem of the quantum dot exciton interacting with the microcavity photon and purely classical problem of two coupled pendulums is quite deep . the excitonic polarization in a semiconductor is indeed described by the oscillator - like equation of motion and so does the electric field of the cavity photon  @xcite .",
    "hence , the physics of these two different systems is similar which greatly simplifies theoretical description of the quantum - dot - in - a - cavity dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes particularly interesting if @xmath6 dots are placed in the microcavity : it turns out that , provided the dots are identical , only one excitonic mode  termed _ superradiant _  interacts with the cavity mode , and the interaction constant is enhanced compared with that in one dot by the factor @xmath7 . in classical language , for @xmath8 pendulums describing quantum dot excitons ,",
    "one oscillation mode is specific , namely , the mode where all pendulums oscillate in phase with each other .    just like the classical oscillators which are ideal only as far as model situations are considered , the excitons and photons interact with the environment , which gives rise to their damping and dephasing , moreover , the oscillation law can differ from the harmonic one .",
    "main reasons of unharmonicity are identified : interactions between excitons lead to their energy shifts , the oscillator strength saturation results in the decrease of the coupling constant with an increase of the exciton number in the system , excitons can bind together to form biexcitons  @xcite .",
    "hence , the analysis of the non - linear dynamics of the quantum dot excitons strongly coupled to the cavity mode is of prime importance . in particular ,",
    "the stability of the superradiant mode with respect to the interactions should be investigated .    in this paper , we consider the simplest possible and physically most transparent case of the non - linearity caused by the exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "it is analogous to the cubic unharmonicity of the pendulum .",
    "we calculate the optical emission spectra of the quantum - dot - in - a - cavity system under a non - resonant excitation ( photoluminescence spectra ) .",
    "the non - resonant pumping is modeled as a random force acting on the corresponding oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the parameter which controls the non - linearity is the pumping rate : the higher the pumping , the larger the fluctuations of excitonic polarization and , correspondingly , the higher are the non - linear terms in the equations of motion .    in our approach ,",
    "the quantum dot state is described as a classical unharmonic oscillator .",
    "hence , this approach is valid for large enough quantum dots where excitons are quantized as a whole .",
    "similar behavior can be expected in a variety of systems including the semiconductor systems with planar quantum microcavities where excitons can be trapped by the disorder and the non - linear regime is easily reached  @xcite , or quantum well structures with dipolar excitons  @xcite , as well as many other , e.g. optomechanical structures where the optical mode of the cavity interacts with a classical oscillator  @xcite .",

    "the interaction of the cavity mode with the ground states of quantum dot excitons is considered only , the treatment can be generalized to allow for the excited states . moreover , the polarization degree of freedom of the cavity mode and spin degrees of freedom of excitons are disregarded . under these approximations the equations of motion for the dimensionless electric field @xmath13 and excitonic polarizations @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are ( phenomenological ) decay rates for the cavity and excitons , respectively , @xmath2 is the light - matter coupling constant ( taken the same in all dots for the sake of simplicity ) .",

    "under conventional non - resonant pumping conditions the excitons are generated in the wetting layer and form a reservoir .",

    "another important feature revealed in fig .  [ fig : pl1 ] is the strong asymmetry between the spectral shapes of the exciton peak for large positive and negative detuning , cf .",

    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]      now we turn to the discussion of the emission spectra of the cavity with two embedded dots , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl2 ] .",
    "the specific feature of this problem in the linear regime is the formation of the collective , superradiant mode of the quantum dot excitons  @xcite . in particular , as discussed above in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , there are three eigenmodes of the homogeneous linear system eq .   for @xmath160 . in case",
    "where @xmath161 , one of these modes , with the excitons oscillating with the opposite phases , @xmath162 , does not interact with the cavity mode , it is called dark .",
    "two remaining modes correspond to the excitons , oscillating in phase , @xmath163 , and are formed by the coupling between the superradiant mode of the excitons and the cavity mode .",
    "only two peaks are manifested in the emission spectrum .",
    "the superradiant effect leads to the enhancement of the rabi splitting between these peaks from @xmath2 to @xmath46 , see eq .  .",
    "when the frequencies of the dots @xmath11 are different , or the exciton tunneling between the dots is introduced , the dark modes mix with the superradiant mode and the spectrum acquires three - peak shape .",
    "as is demonstrated in previous work @xcite , the superradiant mode is stable against the disorder when the characteristic splitting of the dot frequencies is less than @xmath164 .",
    "here we analyze the stability of the superradiant mode against the interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig : pl2 ] shows the emission spectra of the microcavity containing two quantum dots for various frequencies of the cavity mode .",
    "the frequency separation between the dots was fixed to be @xmath165 and the @xmath10 was varied . overall intensity dependence on the emission and cavity frequency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl2](a ) is quite similar to the intensity distribution for one dot in the microcavity [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : pl1](a ) ] and clearly demonstrates two peaks for any given cavity mode position .",
    "thus , the superradiant mode is stable against the interaction .    panels ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : pl2 ] present the details of emission spectra for three different cavity mode positions .",
    "black / solid curves are calculated for the strong pumping where the nonlinear behavior is pronounced , red / thin curves correspond to the linear regime .",
    "the emission spectra in the non - linear regime corresponding to rather large detunings [ panels ( b ) , ( d ) ] demonstrate the asymmetry studied for the single dot in the cavity in sec .",
    "[ sec:1osc_photon ] .",
    "interestingly , the spectra in the linear regime demonstrate three peaks : two stronger ones correspond to the dot emission and weaker one to the cavity emission .",
    "the presence of non - linearity induced by the strong pumping qualitatively changes the emission spectrum : excitonic peaks merge and their intensity drops .",
    "note , however , that the strong coupling regime is still maintained , see anticrossing in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl2 ] . the smallest splitting between the maxima of the spectra is larger than the rabi splitting for the single dot @xmath166 .",
    "this is a fingerprint of the superradiant mode stability in the non - linear regime .",
    "thus , the superradiant mode becomes stabilized by interactions . indeed , for positive detunings , @xmath167 ,",
    "the blueshifts of the quantum dots are different : the dot with higher exciton frequency ( dot 2 in our calculation ) has smaller lifetime due to proximity to the cavity mode , correspondingly , smaller exciton intensity @xmath168 , and , hence , smaller blueshift .",
    "hence , with an increase of the pumping rate the blueshifted dot frequencies approach to each other , resulting in the decrease of the splitting between exciton frequencies and stabilization of the superradiant mode .",
    "to conclude , we have developed a theory of non - linear emission of quantum dots coupled to the optical mode of the microcavity under non - resonant excitation .",
    "we model quantum dot excitons as non - linear oscillators taking into account the repulsive exciton - exciton interactions both within the dot and between the quantum dot and excitonic reservoir .",
    "we use random sources approach to model the relaxation processes and apply stochastic linearization and numerical integration of the langevin equations to determine the spectra .",
    "our model clearly shows that interactions : ( i ) blueshift the transition energy and ( ii ) to the same extent broaden the emission peak .",
    "the interactions result in the complex behavior of the exciton lifetimes and intensities of emission as functions of pumping rate .",
    "the emission lines are strongly asymmetric and bear information on the exciton statistics .",
    "contrary to the linear regime , the lineshapes are sensitive to the sign of the detuning between the exciton and photon modes .",
    "interestingly , even for substantial pumping the strong coupling regime between the cavity mode and the quantum dot exciton can be preserved . moreover , if two quantum dots are placed in the cavity , the superradiant behavior can be stabilized by the pumping ."
