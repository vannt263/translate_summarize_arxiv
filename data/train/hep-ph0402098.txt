    "interest in the temporal and spatial variation of major constants of physics has been recently revived by astronomical data which seem to suggest a variation of the electromagnetic constant @xmath4 at the @xmath5 level for the time scale 10 billion years , see @xcite ( a discussion of other limits can be found in the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , an independent experimental confirmation is needed .",
    "the hypothetical unification of all interactions implies that variation of the electromagnetic interaction constant @xmath6 should be accompanied by the variation of masses and the strong interaction constant .",
    "specific predictions need a model .",
    "for example , the grand unification model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that the quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) scale @xmath7 ( defined as the position of the landau pole in the logarithm for the running strong coupling constant ) is modified as follows : @xmath8 .",
    "the variation of quark and electron masses in this model is given by @xmath9 .",
    "this gives an estimate for the variation of the dimensionless ratio @xmath10 this result is strongly model - dependent ( for example , the coefficient may be an order of magnitude smaller and even of opposite sign @xcite ) .",
    "however , the large coefficients in these expressions are generic for grand unification models , in which modifications come from high energy scales : they appear because the running strong coupling constant and higgs constants ( related to mass ) run faster than @xmath6 .",
    "this means that if these models are correct the variation of masses and the strong interaction scale may be easier to detect than the variation of @xmath6 .",
    "one can only measure the variation of dimensionless quantities and therefore we want to extract from the measurements the variation of the dimensionless ratio @xmath11  where @xmath12 is the quark mass ( with the dependence on the renormalization point removed ) .",
    "a number of limits on the variation of @xmath11 have been obtained recently from consideration of big bang nucleosynthesis , quasar absorption spectra and the oklo natural nuclear reactor , which was active about 1.8 billion years ago @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "below we consider the limits which follow from quasar absorption radio spectra and laboratory atomic clock comparisons .",
    "laboratory limits with a time base of the order one year are especially sensitive to oscillatory variations of fundamental constants . a number of relevant measurements have been performed already and even larger numbers have been started or are planned . the increase in precision is happening very fast .",
    "it has been pointed out by karshenboim @xcite that measurements of ratios of hyperfine structure intervals in different atoms are sensitive to any variation of nuclear magnetic moments .",
    "first rough estimates of the dependence of nuclear magnetic moments on @xmath11 and limits on the variation of this ratio with time were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . using h , cs and hg@xmath1 measurements @xcite",
    ", we obtained a limit on the variation of @xmath11 of about @xmath13 per year .",
    "below we calculate the dependence of nuclear magnetic moments on @xmath11 and obtain the limits from recent atomic clock experiments with hyperfine transitions in h , rb , cs , yb@xmath1,hg@xmath1 and the optical transition in hg@xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to assume that the strong interaction scale , @xmath7 , does not vary , so we will speak about the variation of masses ( this means that we measure masses in units of @xmath7 ) .",
    "we shall restore the explicit appearance of @xmath7 in the final answers .",
    "the hyperfine structure constant can be presented in the following form @xmath14 [ \\alpha ^2 f_{rel } ( z \\alpha ) ] [ \\mu \\frac{m_e}{m_p}]\\ ] ] the factor in the first bracket is an atomic unit of energy .",
    "the second `` electromagnetic '' bracket determines the dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "an approximate expression for the relativistic correction factor ( casimir factor ) for an s - wave electron is the following @xmath15 where @xmath16 and z is the nuclear charge .",
    "variation of @xmath6 leads to the following variation of @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 more accurate numerical many - body calculations @xcite of the dependence of the hyperfine structure on @xmath6 have shown that the coefficient @xmath20 is slightly larger than that given by this formula . for cs ( @xmath21=55 ) @xmath20= 0.83 ( instead of 0.74 ) , for rb @xmath20=0.34 ( instead of 0.29 ) and finally for hg@xmath1 @xmath20=2.28 ( instead of 2.18 ) .    the last bracket in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) contains the dimensionless nuclear magnetic moment @xmath22 ( i.e. , the nuclear magnetic moment @xmath23 ) , electron mass @xmath24 and proton mass @xmath25 .",
    "we may also include a small correction arising from the finite nuclear size . however , its contribution is insignificant .",
    "recent experiments measured the time dependence of the ratios of the hyperfine structure intervals of @xmath26hg@xmath1 and h @xcite , @xmath27cs and @xmath28rb @xcite and the ratio of the optical frequency in hg@xmath1 to the hyperfine frequency of @xmath27cs  @xcite . in the ratio of two hyperfine structure constants for",
    "different atoms time dependence may appear from the ratio of the factors @xmath17 ( depending on @xmath6 ) as well as from the ratio of nuclear magnetic moments ( depending on @xmath11 ) .",
    "magnetic moments in a single - particle approximation ( one unpaired nucleon ) are : @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 for @xmath32 . here",
    "the orbital g - factors are @xmath33 for a valence proton and @xmath34 for a valence neutron .",
    "the present values of the spin g - factors , @xmath35 , are @xmath36 for proton and @xmath37 for neutron .",
    "they depend on @xmath11 .",
    "the light quark masses are only about @xmath38 of the nucleon mass ( @xmath39 5 mev ) and the nucleon magnetic moment remains finite in the chiral limit , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , one might think that the corrections to @xmath35 arising from the finite quark masses would be very small .",
    "however , through the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , which leads to contributions to hadron properties from goldstone boson loops , one may expect some enhancement of the effect of quark masses  @xcite .",
    "the natural framework for discussing such corrections is chiral perturbation theory and we discuss these chiral corrections next .",
    "in recent years there has been tremendous progress in the calculation of hadron properties using lattice qcd .",
    "moore s law , in combination with sophisticated algorithms , means that one can now make extremely accurate calculations for light quark masses ( @xmath12 ) larger than 50 mev",
    ". however , in order to compare with experimental data , it is still necessary to extrapolate quite a long way as a function of quark mass .",
    "this extrapolation is rendered non - trivial by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd , which leads to goldstone boson loops and , as a direct consequence , non - analytic behaviour as a function of quark mass  @xcite .",
    "fortunately the most important nonanalytic contributions are model independent , providing a powerful constraint on the extrapolation procedure .    in the past few years the behaviour of hadron properties as a function of quark mass has been studied over a much wider range than one needs for the present purpose  @xcite .",
    "one can therefore apply the successful extrapolation formulas developed in the context of lattice qcd with considerable confidence .",
    "the key qualitative feature learnt from the study of lattice data is that goldstone boson loops are strongly suppressed once the compton wavelength of the boson is smaller than the source .",
    "inspection of lattice data for a range of observables , from masses to charge radii and magnetic moments , reveals that the relevant mass scale for this transition is @xmath41 mev ",
    "i.e. , @xmath42 mev  @xcite .",
    "the challenge of chiral extrapolation is therefore to incorporate the correct , model independent non - analytic behaviour dictated by chiral symmetry while ensuring excellent convergence properties of the chiral expansion in the large mass region , as well as maintaining the model independence of the results of the extrapolation .",
    "considerable study of this problem has established that the use of a finite range regulator ( frr ) fulfils all of these requirements  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of the mass of the nucleon , it has been shown that the extrapolation from @xmath43 gev@xmath44 to the physical pion mass  a change of @xmath12 by a factor of 10  can be carried out with a systematic error less than 1%  @xcite . in the following",
    "we apply this same method to calculate the change in the nucleon mass , corresponding to quark mass changes at the level of 0.1% or less , as required in the present context .      the expansion for the mass of the nucleon given in ref .",
    "@xcite is : @xmath45 where the chiral loops which given rise , respectively , to the leading and next - to - leading nonanalytic ( lna and nlna ) behaviour are : @xmath46 and the relevant integrals are defined ( in heavy baryon approximation ) as : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the relevant baryon mass difference ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) .",
    "we take the @xmath51@xmath52 mass splitting , @xmath53 , to have its physical value ( 0.292 gev ) , while @xmath54 .",
    "the regulator function , @xmath55 , is taken to be a dipole with mass @xmath56 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tadint ] ) @xmath57 , defined such that @xmath58 vanishes at @xmath59 , is a local counter term introduced in frr to ensure a linear relation for the renormalisation of @xmath60 .    the model independence of the expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] ) is ensured by fitting the unknown coefficients to the physical nucleon mass and lattice data from the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite , yielding : @xmath61 ( with all parameters expressed in the appropriate powers of gev ) . with these parameters fixed one can evaluate the rate of change of the mass of the nucleon with quark or pion mass at the physical pion mass : @xmath62 a quantity commonly known as the pion - nucleon sigma commutator . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - comm ] ) one finds the relationship ( in terms of dimensionless quantities ) : @xmath63 the extension of this procedure to the effect of a variation in the strange quark mass is similar , but one must include the variation arising from @xmath64-nucleon loops , as well as kaon loops with intermediate @xmath65 or @xmath66 baryons .",
    "@xmath67 these contributions can be expressed as @xmath68 with @xmath69 the associated coupling squared .",
    "once again we select the dipole regulator : @xmath70 for the relevant diagrams , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 where we take @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we use the gell mann - oakes - renner relation in the su(2 ) chiral limit to relate the variation of the kaon mass in the chiral su(2 ) limit , @xmath77 gev ( with @xmath78 , the physical pion\\{kaon } mass ) , to the variation of the strange quark mass ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "hence the variation of the nucleon mass with strange quark mass is given by : @xmath80 using the dipole regulator mass , @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn - ms - variation ] ) leads to the result : @xmath81      the treatment of the mass dependence of the nucleon magnetic moments is very similar to that for the masses .",
    "once again the loops which give rise to the lna and nlna behaviour are evaluated with a frr , while the smooth , analytic variation with quark mass is parametrized by fitting relevant lattice data with a finite number of adjustable constants .    for the lattice data we use cssm lattice collaboration results @xcite of nucleon 3-point functions .",
    "results are obtained using established techniques in the extraction of form factor data @xcite .",
    "similar calculations have also been recently reported by the qcdsf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we use the two heaviest simulation results , @xmath82@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "these simulations were performed with the flic fermion action  @xcite on a @xmath84 lattice at @xmath85 .    in the magnetic moment case",
    "the formulae are a little more complicated , so we leave the details for the appendix . suffice it to say here that the relevant processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "again we use a dipole form for the regulator with @xmath86 gev .",
