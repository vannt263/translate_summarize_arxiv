    "@xmath6 stands for the transmission coefficient of the record / upload .",
    "the quadrature noisy operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 describe the added noises in the state transfer .",
    "the variance of vacuum noise is considered to be unity . from the heisenberg uncertainty principle ,",
    "the minimal variance of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . in this case",
    ", there is no noise excess in the record / upload process .",
    "it corresponds to transmission exhibiting only a pure loss , which can be modeled by a virtual beam splitter between light and atoms with vacuum in the free port .",
    "such the noise excess free record / upload is advantageous because it can preserve some important non - classical properties of quantum states .",
    "it will never completely break entanglement of gaussian state , vanish sub - poisson behavior of single - photon state @xcite or quantum superposition of coherent states @xcite .",
    "also only loss in the record / upload will not break security of the continuous - variable key distribution protocol with coherent states if the reverse reconciliation is used @xcite .",
    "basically , information encoded into the quadratures and gaussian entanglement or security of key distribution are not changed if the recorded / upoload state is only unitarily transformed by a known gaussian operation like the phase shift , displacement and squeezing . in this case , the record / upload is noise excess free up to that unitary operation .",
    "particularly , we focus on the noise excess free record / upload up to the squeezing operation : @xmath11 , @xmath12 . for an application , either the squeezing could be actively post - corrected in the memory , as will be proposed below , or if it is not necessary , it can be finally simply corrected on the measured data . to increase a quality of the upload , also a pre - squeezing operation @xmath13 , @xmath14 on the light mode before record / upload can be considered .",
    "it transforms the input state to its squeezed version before the record / upload into the memory .",
    "it will be shown , both the pre - squeezing of input state and the post - squeezing correction can remarkably help to reach the noise excess free record or even the lossless upload of quantum state into the memory .",
    "consider now the quantum memory experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . in that experimental setup",
    ", there are two simultaneously available quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) interactions between the light and atoms inside the cells . basically , they couple together the mode of light described by two complementary quadratures @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the effective collective atomic mode having complementary quadratures @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "both the qnd transformations can be simply described in heisenberg picture : @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an effective coupling constant @xcite .",
    "either coupling ( [ coupl1 ] ) or ( [ coupl2 ] ) can be separately activated in the same set - up @xcite .",
    "both are the particular qnd interactions , but the following analysis is generally valid for any kind of the qnd transformation between the quadratures of light and atomic memory .    if the coupling ( [ coupl1 ] ) is considered , the quadrature @xmath3 can be directly written into the memory by the light - atom interaction , up to the added noise from the atomic quadrature @xmath4 . to write the complementary quadrature @xmath2 , the light pulse passing through the memory",
    "is measured by homodyne detection and the photocurrent controls the magnetic field applied with an adjustable gain to the atomic cells . by this feed - forward technique",
    ", the atomic quadrature @xmath5 can be displaced whereas the quadrature @xmath4 is not disturbed .",
    "this is standard record mechanism used in the ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "now we assume the record of unknown quantum state up to the squeezing of the recorded state .",
    "after such the procedure , the transformation of the atomic quadratures takes the following form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an overall gain of the feed - forward correction and @xmath20 is a scaling factor representing the squeezing of recorded state .",
    "the effective atomic mode is considered initially in vacuum state with the unit variance . to obtain the noise excess free record up to the squeezing",
    ", the parameters have to satisfy the following equations @xmath21 the solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , gives a possibility to achieve the noise excess free record described by eqs .",
    "( [ noiseless ] ) up to the squeezing .",
    "the record transmission coefficient @xmath24 of the transfer from the light mode to atomic mode shows that an unknown state written inside the memory is always squeezed by the factor @xmath23 .",
    "but even for very small @xmath25 , any state can be ( up to the squeezing ) written into the memory with no noise excess . for a feasible gain around @xmath26 ,",
    "the upload can be up to the noise excess free attenuation @xmath27 up to the squeezing .",
    "such the noise excess free record even without the squeezing correction can be useful , for example , for the manipulations with gaussian entanglement .",
    "using computable measure of entanglement for gaussian state @xcite , it is straightforward to prove the following comparison . let us compare the cases after the record , without squeezing correction and with perfect squeezing correction . consider single mode from two - mode gaussian",
    "entangled state which is recorded into the memory . for any single - mode noisy gaussian operation after the noise excess free record ( up to the squeezing ) , even with an arbitrary small @xmath25 , no matter that the uncorrected squeezing reduces entanglement it will never help to subsequent gaussian channel to completely break entanglement .",
    "it means that for both the cases , the thresholds to pass entanglement through the record procedure plus consecutive gaussian channel are identical .",
    "it illustrates a practical advantage of the noise excess free record up to the squeezing .",
    "such the result is generally impossible to obtain if there is a noise excess in the record .    to actively compensate the squeezing of the recorded state inside the memory ,",
    "the squeezing post - correction is necessary .",
    "the squeezing post - correction should make transformation @xmath28 and @xmath29 to reduce effect of the squeezing in the atomic memory .",
    "since the total record process could exhibit pure loss , the squeezing post - correction can be implemented at a cost of an additional loss in the record . to build post - correction operation , the second kind of the coupling ( [ coupl2 ] ) with the coupling constant @xmath30 is now assumed in the same experimental set - up .",
    "now , the light mode described by @xmath31 and @xmath32 is considered in vacuum state .",
    "thus only bright local oscillator is injected into the cells .",
    "the homodyne measurement of @xmath33 quadrature of the pulse outgoing from the cells is followed by the feed - forward displacement of the atomic quadrature @xmath4 by the magnetic field . to achieve a desirable squeezing post - correction @xmath28 and @xmath29 (",
    "@xmath34 is considered to compensate the squeezing in eqs .",
    "( [ record ] ) ) up to a pure loss ( but without any noise excess ) , the transformations @xmath35 have to satisfy the following conditions @xmath36 it can be achieved if @xmath37 and then @xmath38 is given for any @xmath39 .",
    "the additional losses introduced by the post - correction are characterized by the transmission @xmath40 . since @xmath34",
    ", the squeezing post - correction can be performed only in the @xmath5 quadrature . to precisely compensate the squeezing introduced in the record ,",
    "it is necessary to adjust @xmath41 . from this",
    "follows that @xmath42 and total transmission coefficient of the record plus squeezing correction is given by @xmath43 the maximal transmission @xmath44 is achieved for @xmath26 ( @xmath45 ) which is feasible in the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite . as the result",
    ", any quantum state can be in principle deterministically recorded without noise excess as is described by eq .",
    "( [ noiseless ] ) up to the transmission @xmath46 .",
    "another open possibility how to compensate the squeezing in the recorded state is a pre - squeezing @xmath47 and @xmath13 of the state which should be recorded . from a simple calculation",
    "follows that this configuration does not lead in principle to the noise excess free record .",
    "but if both the pre - squeezing and squeezing post - correction are considered together , the local pre - squeezing helps to increase the coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "taking both the pre - squeezing and squeezing post - correction into the consideration , the record mechanism is described by the transformations : @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the scaling factor corresponding to the pre - squeezing of the light mode . to approach the noise excess free record ,",
    "it is necessary to adjust electronic gain @xmath50 and then the squeezing correction after the record is determined by @xmath51 .",
    "thus for a given @xmath17 , the squeezing post - correction has to be larger ( @xmath20 should be smaller ) as @xmath49 is bigger .",
    "interestingly , the transmission coefficient @xmath52 of the record up to the squeezing is effectively increased as the squeezing factor @xmath49 is larger .",
    "remarkably , by only local pre - squeezing of the state , which should be recorded into memory , the coupling constant @xmath17 is increased . since @xmath53 approaches unity for sufficiently large @xmath49 , a lossless record up to the squeezing can be approached .",
    "it is even possible for an arbitrary small @xmath25 if the sufficient pre - squeezing is available . on the other hand ,",
    "if the uploaded state inside the memory should be not squeezed , the squeezing correction has to be applied .",
    "then , to reach the limit @xmath44 , @xmath54 has to be satisfied and it can be approached for any @xmath17 as the pre - squeezing is increasing .",
    "this deterministic record can be used to upload not only coherent states and gaussian entangled states , but also highly nonclassical single - photon state as an useful quantum resource .",
    "the single - photon state can be prepared by the single - photon subtraction from the squeezed light @xcite . actually , the state prepared by such the procedure approaches the squeezed single - photon state @xcite .",
    "this squeezing would be advantageous for the upload procedure as has been discussed .",
    "but , to have exactly single - photon state inside memory , it is necessary to actively apply the squeezing post - correction .",
    "this operation can be naturally included into the uploading scheme proposed above . in a result , to get single - photon state inside the memory , the single - photon subtraction can be simply applied on the squeezed state followed by the uploading procedure proposed above .",
    "but still the upload has some uncertainty , we do not know if the single photon state is actually inside the memory .",
    "therefore , the uploaded state is a mixture @xmath55 where @xmath56 which optimally approaches @xmath57 as @xmath54 .",
    "the wigner function of that state is never negative since @xmath58 @xcite , but still any mixture ( [ mix ] ) with @xmath59 is a non - classical state @xcite . for example , the statistics of ( [ mix ] ) is always sub - poissonian for arbitrary @xmath59 . in experiments with the single photons , this method can be used only if the post - selection on the fixed number of photons is finally applied to have complete control how many photons participated in the experiment .",
    "note , there is a similar requirement for the linear optical experiments with the single photons .",
    "they work correctly only if all the photons are finally detected .",
    "fortunately , there is a better way how to upload the single - photon state . instead of the deterministic electro - optical feed - forward correction , a proper post - selection of measured data from the homodyne detector is applied .",
    "it makes the upload only probabilistic , but since the uploaded state is resource , it is acceptable if the rate is not too small . for the upload of the gaussian states , there is no gain from this probabilistic method over the previous deterministic feed - forward correction .",
    "but for the non - classical non - gaussian states , for example , for the squeezed single - photon state produced by the single - photon subtraction @xcite the post - selection of the measured quadrature @xmath33 in a tiny interval @xmath60 around value @xmath61 will remarkably help .    to simply understand why it will help , the unitary coupling ( [ coupl2 ] ) between light and atoms can expand for very small @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is an interaction time , as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are annihilation operators of the light and atomic modes . in this convention",
    ", the vacuum noise has variance @xmath0 .",
    "the ideal projection on the eigenstate @xmath67 of @xmath33 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath61 can be rewritten in a form of @xmath68 .",
    "initially , light is in the fock state @xmath69 and atomic mode is in the vacuum state @xmath70 .",
    "straightforwardly , we can prove that @xmath71 and from it follows that in the limit of weak coupling and very tight post - selection @xmath72 , it is possible to upload single - photon state to the memory without any loss and noise .    to calculate the upload for a finite @xmath73",
    ", we use the formalism of wigner functions .",
    "the squeezed single - photon state is represented by the wigner function @xmath74 where @xmath20 is squeezing parameter .",
    "the atomic memory is considered initially in vacuum state described by the wigner function @xmath75 .",
    "the application of the coupling ( [ coupl2 ] ) on the product @xmath76 followed by the homodyne detection and above mentioned post - selection will generate the wigner function @xmath77+\\mbox{erf}\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a } \\left(b+\\kappa x\\right)\\right ] \\right)-\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\pi^3 } s d } \\exp\\left(-2\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-2x^2\\frac{d^2}{a^2}-2p^2\\frac{a^2}{d^2 } \\right)\\times\\nonumber\\\\ \\left(b\\mbox{cosh}\\left[\\frac{4b\\kappa x}{a^2}\\right]+\\kappa x \\mbox{sinh}\\left[\\frac{4b\\kappa x}{a^2}\\right]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the state uploaded into the memory , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 $ ] is error function .",

    "the squeezing post - correction does not depend on the post - selection threshold @xmath73 . to approach controllable upload , the squeezing post - correction proposed in the previous section",
    "can not be used , since it can work only up to additional losses which destroys the desired control of upload .",
    "but , fortunately , if both @xmath85 are small then the squeezing post - correction can be approximately omitted and the uploaded state is @xmath86 as the result , the single - photon state is probabilistically uploaded into the memory with full control and remarkably , is not attenuated comparing to the previous deterministic case .",
    "thus the post - selection compensates the loss which occurs in the deterministic upload .",
    "since the probabilistic upload is obtained for a small @xmath17 , the post - selection also compensates strength of the coupling between light and atoms .",
    "but as @xmath17 decreases , the post - selection threshold @xmath73 has to decrease and it reduces the success rate of the upload .    to simply measure quality of the single - photon state uploaded into the memory versus the success rate of the upload , the fidelity and negativity of wigner function can be used .",
    "the fidelity between the uploaded state described by the wigner function @xmath87 and target single - photon state with the corresponding wigner function @xmath84 is defined as @xmath88 whereas the negativity in the origin of the phase space is given simply by @xmath89 .",
    "the expression for the fidelity is rather complex but for both the @xmath17 and @xmath73 small , the expansion @xmath90 shows how the result of a sufficiently tight post - selection practically does not depend on a small @xmath17 . without the squeezing post - correction , the maximal fidelity is exactly @xmath91 in the limit @xmath92 . for a small @xmath73 ,",
    "the negativity of wigner function is @xmath93 the maximum of negativity @xmath94 can be always approached if @xmath73 is sufficiently small .",
    "the @xmath95 is independent on @xmath20 and @xmath17 because the negativity of wigner function is not changed by the pre - squeezing .",
    "both the fidelity and negativity can be achieved with the success rate approaching @xmath96 which grows as pre - squeezing parameter @xmath20 is smaller . here the pre - squeezing plays also positive role , it significantly enhances the probability of success .",
    "the quantitative results of the single photon upload are depicted in fig.1 .",
    "the pre - squeezing @xmath97 can evidently help to increase the success rate for both the fidelity as well as for the negativity , three curves are depicted for @xmath98 . thus squeezing of the single - photon state from the squeezed light by the single photon subtraction is actually an advantage for the upload into the memory .",
    "contrary to the deterministic case , the post - selection can effectively increase the coupling between light and atoms .    to approach such the lossless upload of single photon state , the in - coupling and out - coupling losses have to be minimized .",
    "the in - coupling losses will mix the single - photon state with vacuum state and in a result , a less sub - poissonian state is actually uploaded .",
    "the efficiency of homodyne detector can be can be very close to unity and also electronic noise of homodyne detection can be negligible , if the power of local oscillator is high .",
    "the out - coupling losses can be joined with the efficiency of the homodyne detection to an effective total out - coupling efficiency @xmath99 .",
    "the fidelity ( [ fi ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath99 , as can be seen from fig .  2 . to approach the losses upload",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath17 has to be reasonably high and then , the pre - squeezing in the opposite direction ( @xmath100 ) can help to reach unit fidelity of the single - photon state at a cost of the success rate .",
    "a superposition of the coherent states is considered as an another resource for the highly non - linear quantum operations and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "it is rather a superposition of many fock states , than just single fock state , therefore it can be interesting to investigate whether the upload can transfer such the state of light into the memory .",

    "fortunately , this amplitude can be successfully compensated by a sufficient pre - squeezing ( @xmath20 is small ) .",
    "thus sufficiently large superposition of coherent states can be also uploaded into the quantum memory without any loss .    in a contrast to a simple phase - insensitive character of the single photon state , the superposition of coherent states exhibits more complex phase - space behavior . in one quadrature there two symmetrically located gaussian peaks like for the classical mixture of the coherent states . on the other hand ,",
    "the complementary quadrature shows multiple interference fringes covered by a gaussian envelope . because the fidelity averages both the interference as well as distinguishable peaks , it is not good measure of a quality of the uploaded superposition . from this reason ,",

    "the uploaded state closely approaches the ideal pure state superposition with the reduced amplitude .",
    "the pre - squeezing plays here also a remarkable role . in fig .  2 ( upper picture ) , there is a marginal distribution of the uploaded state without pre - squeezing .",
    "evidently , the interference is vanishing .",
    "but if the sufficient pre - squeezing ( -6db ) is applied ( lower picture ) then the fringes can be observed and also the success rate is higher .",
    "in conclusion , the deterministic noise excess free record of unknown state and the probabilistic lossless upload of the resource state ( single - photon state , superposition of coherent states ) into quantum memory are proposed , both based on the original quantum memory experiment in ref .",
    "first , the deterministic scheme is able to record unknown quantum state only with a reduced transmission ( maximally @xmath0 ) .",
    "the pre - squeezing of the state of light going to the memory can compensate small coupling strength between light and atomic memory .",
    "but this record is without any trigger controlling the uploading process what is crucial , for example , for the upload of single photons .",
    "therefore , the probabilistic scheme which is able to upload single - photon state is proposed .",

    "the same method can be used to upload the pure coherent - state superposition , at the cost of the success rate and reduced amplitude of the superposition , but with preservation of the purity of the superposition . in this case , the pre - squeezing not only enhances the success rate , but also effectively enlarges the reduced amplitude of the coherent states in the superposition and thus increases non - classicality of the uploaded state . since the considered scheme has been used in the real experiment set - up , both the methods can be directly used to upload the non - classical resources into quantum memory .",

    "<S> unfortunately , the application of the squeezing post - correction actively is always at a cost of additional loss and for a higher squeezing of the recorded state in the memory , the additional attenuation is larger . in the result , </S>",
    "<S> the purely lossy phase - insensitive record with maximum @xmath0 of transmission can be achieved without any noise excess . </S>",
    "<S> it can be restrictive for the upload of the non - classical resources , such as the single - photon state or the superposition of the coherent states . if the upload is lossy , such the single photon is uncontrollably transferred to the memory , without any trigger saying whether the photon is really uploaded .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the section iii . , a probabilistic upload is proposed based on a post - selection of a result from the homodyne detector in the same memory set - up . </S>",
    "<S> the single photon can be probabilistically uploaded into the memory without loss and with an arbitrary precision , although the coupling between the light and atoms in the memory can be weak . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition of coherent states can be probabilistically uploaded with a reduced amplitude , but with the purity approaching unity . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , for the probabilistic upload the squeezing post - correction can be omitted if the light - atom coupling is sufficiently weak . to increase the success rate of the single - photon upload , the pre - squeezing of the state of light before the upload can be used . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition of coherent states can be uploaded in the same way , but the pre - squeezing plays here more important role , it effectively enhances the amplitude of the coherent states in the uploaded superposition , resulting in more distinguishable interference of the coherent states . because all these proposals are within the existing experiment set - up , they can be directly implemented if the suitable non - classical sources are available . </S>"
