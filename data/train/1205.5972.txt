    "one can reduce the enumeration to combinatorics ; for example , the number of solutions to a schubert problem involving lines is a kostka number for a rectangular partition with two parts .    a prototypical schubert problem is the classical problem of four lines , which asks for the number of lines in space that meet four given lines . to answer this , note that three general lines @xmath1 , and @xmath2 lie on a unique doubly - ruled hyperboloid , shown in figure  [ f : four_lines ] .",

    "the fourth line @xmath4 meets the hyperboloid in two points . through each of these points",
    "there is a line in the second ruling , and these are the two lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 meeting our four given lines . in terms of kostka numbers ,",
    "the problem of four lines reduces to counting the number of tableaux of shape @xmath7 with content @xmath8 .",
    "there are two such tableaux : @xmath9 galois groups of enumerative problems are subtle invariants about which very little is known . while they were introduced by jordan in 1870  @xcite ,",
    "the modern theory began with harris in 1979 , who showed that the algebraic galois group is equal to a geometric monodromy group  @xcite .",
    "in general , we expect the galois group of an enumerative problem to be the full symmetric group and when it is not , the geometric problem possesses some intrinsic structure .",
    "harris result gives one approach to studying the galois group  by directly computing monodromy .",
    "for instance , the galois group of the problem of four lines is the group of permutations which are obtained by following the solutions over loops in the space of lines @xmath10 . rotating @xmath4 180 degrees about the point @xmath11 ( shown in figure [ f : four_lines ] ) gives a loop which interchanges the two solution lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 , showing that the galois group is the full symmetric group on two letters .",

    "billey and vakil  @xcite gave an algebraic approach based on elimination theory to compute lower bounds for galois groups .",
    "vakil  @xcite gave a combinatorial criterion , based on group theory , which can be used to show that a galois group contains the alternating group .",
    "he used this and his geometric littlewood - richardson rule  @xcite to show that the galois group was at least alternating for every schubert problem involving lines in projective space @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "brooks implemented vakil s criterion and the geometric littlewood - richardson rule in python and used it to show that for @xmath14 , every schubert problem involving lines in projective space @xmath12 has at least alternating galois group .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ th : only ] the galois group of any schubert problem involving lines in @xmath12 contains the alternating group .",
    "we prove this theorem by applying vakil s criterion to a special position argument of schubert , which reduces theorem  [ th : only ] to proving a certain inequality among kostka numbers of two - rowed tableaux . for most problems ,",
    "the inequality follows from a combinatorial injection of young tableaux . for the remaining problems , we work in the representation ring of @xmath0 , where these kostka numbers also occur .",
    "we interpret the tensor product of irreducible @xmath0-modules in terms of commuting toeplitz matrices .",
    "using the eigenvector decomposition of the toeplitz matrices , we express these kostka numbers as certain trigonometric integrals . in this way , the inequalities of kostka numbers become inequalities of integrals , which we establish by estimation .",
    "note that the generalization of theorem  [ th : only ] to arbitrary grassmannians is false .",
    "derksen found schubert problems in the grassmannian of @xmath15-planes in @xmath16 whose galois groups are significantly smaller than the full symmetric group , and vakil generalized this to problems in the grassmannians of @xmath17 planes in @xmath18 whose galois groups are not the full symmetric group for every @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite .",

    "@xmath52      in  3.4 of  @xcite , vakil explains how to associate a galois group to a dominant map @xmath53 of equidimensional irreducible varieties and establishes his criterion for the galois group to contain the alternating group .",

    "let @xmath59 be the other projection ; its fiber over a point @xmath60 is @xmath61 thus the map @xmath59 contains all schubert problems of type @xmath41 . as the general schubert problem is a transverse intersection containing @xmath38 points , @xmath62 is a dominant map of degree @xmath38 . under @xmath62 ,",
    "the field of rational functions on @xmath63 pulls back to a subfield of @xmath64 , the field of rational functions on @xmath58 , and the extension @xmath65 has degree @xmath38 .",

    "first , if @xmath69 is a subvariety such that @xmath70 is irreducible and the map @xmath71 has degree @xmath38 , then @xmath71 has a galois group which is a subgroup of @xmath66 .",
    "this enables us to restrict the original schubert problem to one derived from it through certain standard reductions .",
    "more interesting is when @xmath69 is a subvariety such that @xmath72 decomposes into two smaller problems , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a schubert problem of type @xmath75 for @xmath76 . in this situation , monodromy of @xmath71 gives a subgroup @xmath77 of the product @xmath78 which projects onto each factor and includes into @xmath66 .",

    "any schubert problem is equivalent to a reduced one : if @xmath41 is valid , but @xmath85 , then @xmath86 as the intersection  ( [ eq : schubertproblem ] ) for @xmath87 is equal to an intersection for @xmath88 .",
    "iterating this procedure gives an equivalent reduced schubert problem .",
    "schubert  @xcite observed that if the linear spaces are in a special position , then the schubert problem decomposes into two smaller problems , which gives a ( familiar ) recursion for these kostka numbers .",

    "an induction shows that if @xmath41 is valid , then @xmath96 .",
    "for example , consider @xmath97 .",
    "the first tableau in  ( [ eq11:tableaux ] ) has both 4s in its second row ( along with its 5s ) , while the remaining four tableaux have last column consisting of a 4 on top of a 5 .",
    "if we replace the 5s by 4s in the first tableau and erase the last column in the remaining four tableaux , we obtain @xmath98 which shows that @xmath99 .",
    "we state our key lemma .",
    "a of a schubert problem @xmath100 is simply a listing of the integers @xmath100 in some order .",
    "[ l : induction ] every reduced schubert problem has a rearrangement @xmath45 such that either @xmath101 and both are nonzero , or else both are equal to @xmath102 .",
    "we use lemma  [ l : induction ] below to prove theorem  [ th : only ] , then we devote the rest of the extended abstract to the proof of this lemma .",
    "we use the notation of subsection  [ s : vakil ] and argue by induction on @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "assume that @xmath41 is reduced and let @xmath105 be the set of those @xmath60 such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 span a hyperplane .",
    "then the geometric arguments given before  ( [ e : combinatorial_recursion ] ) imply that the pullback @xmath106 decomposes as the union of two schubert problems , one for @xmath107 and the other for @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , lemma  [ l : induction ] and our induction hypothesis , together with vakil s criterion , imply that @xmath66 is at least alternating .    while an induction shows that the only reduced schubert problem where the two terms in  ( [ eq : ineq ] ) are both 1 is @xmath109 , the inequality of lemma  [ l : induction ] is not easy to prove .",
    "this is in part because there are no closed formulas for the numbers @xmath38 , except for the case @xmath110 ( in which case @xmath38 is given by the hook - length formula ) .",
    "we give an injection of sets of young tableaux to establish lemma  [ l : induction ] when @xmath111 for some @xmath112 .",

    "we establish the inequality  ( [ eq : unequal_inequality ] ) via a combinatorial injection @xmath119 which is not surjective .",
    "let @xmath120 be a tableau in @xmath121 and let @xmath122 be its sub - tableau consisting of the entries @xmath123 .",
