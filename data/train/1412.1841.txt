    "phonology is the study of how sequences of meaningless sounds are coordinated in natural languages to make meaningful speech @xcite .",
    "a key idea in phonology is that of _ phonological contrast_. it is the contrast between the sound of different portions of speech that allows meaning to be conveyed .",
    "for example , if i am asked  what will you have to drink ?",
    "\" i can respond by saying  coffee \" or  tea \" , sequences of sounds that have no intrinsic meaning but allow me to convey meaning to you because they form words .",
    "there are many perceptible contrasts between these two words , and this allows information to be conveyed to the hearer .",
    "phonology studies how such contrasts are organized .",
    "for example , an important concept in phonology is that of the _ minimal contrastive pair_. this is a pair of words that differ in only one sound , such as the pairs  bit , bet \" or  can , ban \" .",
    "one observation about contrast in languages is that sometimes words that contrasted in the past do not do so any more @xcite .",
    "this is known as a _",
    "sound merger_. sound mergers are most noticeable when the merger has occurred in one dialect of a language but not another .",
    "an example is the well - known cot  caught merger .",
    "historically , the words  cot \" and  caught \" formed a minimally contrastive pair , having vowels that were pronounced distinctly by english speakers .",
    "however , in many dialects of english today ( including the dialect of the author ) these words are indistinguishable : the vowel sounds in  cot \" and  caught \" have merged .",
    "another example is the near ",
    "square merger in new zealand english , in which the words  beer \" and  bear \" are not distinguishable from their pronunciation @xcite .    how are these contrasts and mergers quantified and studied ?",
    "the acoustic signal of a spoken utterance is extremely complicated , and at a fine detailed level no two utterances ever spoken are identical .",
    "however , through a variety of methods linguists have learned to identify the features of the speech signal that are the most salient to hearers and that do most to establish contrast between different words .",
    "one well - studied family of contrasts is provided by vowel sounds .",
    "linguists have learned that the most important features of vowels are two quantities known as f1 and f2 , which we now explain @xcite .    to a rough approximation ,",
    "the sound of a vowel is a periodic signal with a base frequency known in linguistics as f0 ( the fundamental frequency ) .",
    "f0 varies a great deal from speaker to speaker and its value is not itself used to provide contrast between words in english .",
    "in addition to the base frequency f0 there are harmonics , consisting of integer multiples of f0 . within the harmonics",
    ", the frequencies at which there is a peak in amplitude are known as _",
    "formants_. the frequency of the first formant",
    "is known as f1 , the frequency of the second formant as f2 , and so on .",
    "the first two formants , f1 and f2 , are usually the most important cues used to distinguish vowels in spoken languages @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate these points with some data . in figure",
    "[ fig : bit_bet ] we show plots of the author saying the words  bit , bet \" , generated with the help of the phonetics software package praat @xcite .",
    "the top plot shows the raw acoustic signal .",
    "the first pair of visible disturbances corresponds to the word  bit \" .",
    "the first disturbance is mostly the vowel sound  i \" and the second smaller disturbance is the release of the  t \" sound . the period of quiet between the two bumps is when no air is escaping the mouth while making the  t \" .",
    "the second pair of bumps is similarly the word  bet \" . in order to see the contrast between the words , in the second plot we show the spectrogram of the sound signals .",
    "the vertical axis gives frequency .",
    "darkness in the plot corresponds to greater amplitude at a given time and frequency . during the duration of the vowel",
    "sounds praat has computed the frequency of the formants as a function of time and plotted them in red . taking the average of the formant frequency over the duration of the vowel",
    ", we obtain what we identify as the formant frequency for the vowel , indicated with a blue line and blue text in the plot . for the word  bit \"",
    "we obtain f1@xmath0 hz , f2@xmath1 hz . for the word  bet \" we obtain f1@xmath2 hz , f2@xmath3 hz .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    to a very rough approximation , all speakers in a homogeneous linguistic community use f1 and f2 the same way in order to distinguish vowels . within speakers",
    ", there is variation in the way vowels are produced from utterance to utterance , but all instances of a vowel occupy a similar region in f1-f2 space . to illustrate this figure  [ fig : peterson_barney ] shows the f1 and f2 of many vowels collected from 76 speakers of american english in 1952 @xcite .",
    "note that the vowels in this plot overlap in places .",
    "in reality , these vowels are likely disambiguated by other phonetic variables ( such as f3 ) which are not shown in this plot @xcite .",
    "vowel data from the classic paper @xcite .",
    "each point represents the f1 and f2 values of a recorded vowel .",
    "data consisted of 1520 tokens from 76 speakers , including women and men , children and adults .",
    "the vowels are ( blue ) , ( red ) , ( black ) , ( green ) , ( grey ) , ( magenta ) , ( orange ) , ( purple ) , ( cyan ) , ( yellow ) .",
    "@xcite , width=453 ]    we have just described how the vowel system in languages such as english work .",
    "we mention two other major features of this system .",
    "first , over long periods of time the system is very stable in that the number of sounds and their location in phonetic space do not change much .",
    "when english speakers of today hear alexander graham bell s recording of his voice from 1885 , it is quite intelligible @xcite .",
    "this might be surprising given the imperfect and noisy way speech is transmitted from person to person and generation to generation of speakers .",
    "the location of vowels may shift within f1-f2 space ( as we may say by noting the difference in pronunciation between british and american speakers @xcite ) , but for the most part the vowel system as a whole remains intact .",
    "second , despite this stability , there occasionally are changes to the system , either through splits , where what was once a single sound becomes two , or through mergers , the focus of our discussion here .",
    "we need a model of the system that can account for its stability in most situations over long periods of time but also can explain when breakdowns in the system occur as they occasionally do in the form of mergers .",
    "one explanation for why the vowels in  cot \" and  caught \" merged in some variants of english is that when the two words are spoken in the context of a sentence it is easy to tell which is intended , since  cot \" is a noun and  caught \" is a verb .",
    "the merger is unlikely to result in any confusion .",
    "in contrast , a merger between the pronunciations of the words  can \" and  ca nt \" could make it difficult to communicate .",
    "indeed , recent studies have shown that sound mergers occur more often in situations where the loss of the contrast provided by the two sounds is less harmful to communication @xcite .",
    "what remains is to demonstrate the actual mechanism behind this phenomenon . in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed and explicit model of this important phenomenon that does not rely on language users higher - level goals ( such as a desire to be intelligible ) , but just on how hearers classify what they hear as words .",
    "we demonstrate a simple model of how the pronunciation of words is stored in the mind that is sufficient to explain why two sounds may merge in some linguistic contexts but not in others .",
    "our starting point is _ exemplar models _",
    ", which were first introduced in a non - linguistic context in the work of nosofsky @xcite .",
    "in studying how people performed categorization tasks , nosofsky hypothesized that each time a subject was exposed to a stimulus taken from some category , the subject stored a detailed memory of this single stimulus in their mind , which was called an _",
    "exemplar_. exemplar theory became influential in linguistics through the work of johnson @xcite and pierrehumbert @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter paper @xcite introduced the idea of _ exemplar dynamics _",
    ", in which the long term behaviours of word pronunciations within a population were modelled through the creation , interaction , and eventual fading away of exemplars in speakers minds",
    ". further work on exemplars dynamics in linguistics can be found in @xcite .",
    "to give an idea of the basic structure of exemplar models in linguistics , in figure  [ fig : pangolin ] we show how such a model might handle the contrast between the words  pin \" and  pen \" .",
    "we demonstrate a speaker saying the word  pen \" and that word being successfully communicated to the hearer . in the top of the figure we show the speaker s representation of the two words  pin \" and  pen \" . in reality , the pronunciation of each word is specified by many phonetic variables ; here we just show a single phonetic variable on the @xmath4-axis that represents some aspect of the vowels that provide contrast between the two words .",
    "exemplars of the word ",
    "pin \" are shown in red and exemplars of the word  pen \" are shown in blue .",
    "the speaker decides to say the word  pen \" and so selects one of the ( blue ) exemplars of  pen \" uniformly at random ( shown circled ) .",
    "this exemplar is produced by the speaker as an uttered word , but it is not a perfect duplication of the exemplar : noise and biases of various sorts perturb its phonetic value .",
    "the word is heard by the hearer and its phonetic value is compared to the hearer s other exemplars .",
    "this is shown in the middle , where the received exemplar is coloured black , as it has not been identified as being one word or another yet .",
    "finally , based on the fact that the received exemplar is close to many of the ( blue ) exemplars of  pen \" , and not close to many of the ( red ) exemplars of  pin \" , the hearer classifies the word as an example of the word  pen \" , as shown in the bottom of figure  [ fig : pangolin ] .",
    "the model may include the speaker themselves storing the new exemplar in their memory or not .",
    "this step completes one cycle of reproduction of an exemplar .",
    "this cycle may then continue with the hearer in turn becoming the speaker , and the recently stored exemplar affecting their subsequent production .",
    "production by the speaker and reception by the hearer of the word  pen \" .",
    "though  pin \" and  pen \" are adjacent to each other phonetically , the word is correctly perceived by the hearer in this case .",
    "top : the exemplars of the speaker , and the selected exemplar of the word  pen \" .",
    "middle : the exemplars of the hearer , and how the ( corrupted ) exemplar from the speaker is stored .",
    "bottom : the exemplar is correctly classified as an exemplar of the word  pen\".,width=453 ]    in this paper we describe a particular exemplar dynamics model that elaborates on that shown in figure  [ fig : pangolin ] , and is built directly on the models of @xcite and @xcite . in our model every language - user has a small number of words stored in their memory .",
    "we assume these words are preexisting , and the number of them is fixed .",
    "each word has associated with it a collection of exemplars that are memories of instances of that particular word being used .",
    "the exemplars of a word hold all the information the language - user has about the pronunciation of the word .",
    "each exemplar is described by a scalar or vector @xmath5 describing one or more phonetic variables ( for example , in the case of vowels , f1 and f2 ) , as well as a scalar weight @xmath6 that indicates how strong the memory of the exemplar is .",
    "all exemplars are initiated with a given weight @xmath7 when they are created and then the weight decays with time .",
    "new exemplars are created when a speaker selects one of their words to speak , selects an exemplar from that word s exemplar collection ( randomly with probability proportional to the exemplar weight ) , and utters it .",
    "the exemplar is then received by the hearer who classifies it as one of their words and stores the new exemplar in that word s exemplar collection .",
    "the new exemplar is not an exact duplicate of the original exemplar .",
    "either in the production of the exemplar by the speaker or in the reception and storage of the exemplar by the hearer ( it does nt matter which for our purposes ) there are errors made .",
    "the new exemplar s position is close to that of the original exemplar but undergoes some perturbations , which we now describe .",
    "firstly , we introduce a bias of the new phonetic values towards less extreme values .",
    "a similar effect is used in the model @xcite and is denoted _",
    "lenition_. in that paper , the phonetic value of an exemplar is decreased by a fixed amount every time it is reproduced .",
    "psychologically , this corresponds to the undershooting of a target @xcite .",
    "for the long - time simulations we are interested in here , this choice would result in the phonetic values of all exemplars going to @xmath8 . instead ,",
    "following @xcite we introduce a bias towards the centre of perceptual space , indicating that speakers have a preference for producing exemplars that have neither too large nor too small phonetic values .",
    "we model this by postulating a preferred value of the phonetic variable @xmath5 which we indicate by @xmath9 .",
    "new exemplars have their phonetic value shifted towards @xmath9 in proportion to their distance from it .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is the same for all speakers and does not depend on the category the exemplar is copied from .",
    "naturally this is a gross oversimplification as can be seen from the data in @xcite where such biases are studied experimentally .",
    "secondly there is what pierrehumbert @xcite refers to as _ entrenchment _ : new exemplars produced from a given category are produced with their phonetic values biased towards the mean phonetic value of the exemplars already in this category . unlike lenition , this bias depends on the other exemplars in the system , and so varies with the individual language user and the category in question .",
    "as described below , we use a version of entrenchment that is simpler to work with , but has the same effect as those used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , new exemplars are produced with noise , which we model as a mean - zero gaussian random variable added to the phonetic variable of the exemplar after lenition and entrenchment have been added .    as we describe in more detail in section  [ sec : onecategory ] , these factors of lenition , entrenchment , and noise are incorporated into a model of how the distribution of exemplars in a population of language - users changes over time .",
    "this in turn leads to predictions about how and under what conditions the pronunciations of words in the language change over time .    despite their many successes , exemplar models as described here have some features that make them difficult to work with computationally .",
    "on the one hand , the computational expense of simulating an exemplar model grows with the number of exemplars in the system .",
    "phenomena that may only emerge with millions or billions of exemplars may be missed in simulations of smaller systems . on the other hand ,",
    "exemplar models involve randomness , through both the selection of exemplars to be reproduced , and in the errors in the production of new exemplars .",
    "this means that the result of simulations of exemplar models are random . in order to determine",
    "if a phenomenon in an exemplar simulation is a rare aberration or completely typical , it is necessary to do several exemplar simulations with the same parameters , adding to the cost of studying the system computationally . to overcome these difficulties we study our exemplar models in the limit where the system contains infinitely many exemplars .",
    "instead of keeping track of variables for every exemplar in the system , we use a continuous field variable describing the density of exemplars in phonetic space .",
    "this is quite analogous to the common procedure in mathematics and physics of deriving partial differential equations for particle density fields from laws for microscopic particle dynamics . in this limit , which we call the _ field model _ , rather than the location and weight of every exemplar in phonetic space , we consider fields which describe the density of exemplars of different types within phonetic space .",
    "we derive integro - differential equations for these exemplar density fields , which we refer to as field models for exemplar dynamics .",
    "we study the field models in order to infer properties of the exemplar model in the limit of large numbers of exemplars .    through simulations of exemplar models and the limiting field models ,",
    "we show in this paper how the procedure by which a language - user classifies heard exemplars determines whether or not the pronunciation of two words merges .",
    "we will see that if the language user always classifies heard exemplars accurately , no matter how they are produced , then the sounds in the words merge . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is the potential for exemplars to be misclassified , then the sounds will remain distinct , in agreement with the simulations of @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite , we also find that an important aspect of our model for predicting non - merger is that misclassified exemplars are rejected as unacceptable and not stored in memory as the wrong word .",
    "this is the mechanism for prevention of sound merger proposed by labov in @xcite ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first mathematical analysis of exemplar dynamics .",
    "however , our work is related to that of shipman , faria , and strickland @xcite .",
    "these authors also propose differential equation models for the change of vowel pronunciation within phonetic space .",
    "motivated by a desire to model vowel shifts , the authors propose a model in which every individual in the population has an age and a particular pronunciation of a given vowel .",
    "partial differential equations are derived for how the number of people with a particular age and pronunciation changes with time , taking into account learning and social trends . whereas we assume in our model that all individuals in the population have the same rich mental representation of the pronunciation of words , shipman et al .",
    "assume that within an individual the pronunciation of each vowel is represented by a single scalar , but this scalar is different between different members of the population . in this sense",
    "our goals are complementary to those of @xcite in that we provide a mechanism for why two vowels do not merge , whereas they take non - merger as a given . in section  [ sec : onecategory ]",
    "we describe our exemplar model and its limiting field model in the case of a single word characterized by a single phonetic variable . in section  [ sec : multiple ] we extend our exemplar model to more than one word , describing our model of interaction of pronunciations of words through the classification of produced exemplars by hearers .",
    "we derive the analogous field model for the multiple word case .",
    "we explore how different models of the way hearers classify exemplars leads to either merger or non - merger . in section  [ sec : twodim ] we show some numerical experiments of our exemplar model and its field limit in the case of two phonetic variables , allowing a more direct , though qualitative , comparison with the data in figure  [ fig : peterson_barney ] . in section  [ sec : functional_load ] we discuss what predictions our model makes for sound merger in real languages and tie our work to the literature on functional load @xcite . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results and discuss directions for further research .    in order to have tractable models of the phenomena of interest , in all that follows we have made a simplifying assumption . rather than modelling each individual in a population of speakers with their own exemplars , we pool all the exemplars in the population .",
    "( this choice is analogous to random mating in the wright - fisher model in population genetics .",
    ") this will not make a significant difference to our results if each individual in the population has the same words with the same statistical characteristics of exemplars associated with their words . with this assumption",
    ", it does not matter whether just hearers or both speakers and hearers store a copy of new exemplars in their lexicon , the effect just being to change some parameters .",
    "so for the sake of simplicity we make the former modelling assumption : that new exemplars are only stored by the hearer .",
    "in this section we first describe our exemplar model in the case of a single word with exemplars possessing a single phonetic variable .",
    "the single word case is linguistically unrealistic ; however it lays down the groundwork for the multiple word case covered in the next section . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : onecat_exemp ] we present the exemplar model together with some numerical simulations . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : onecat_nonloc ] we present equations for the dynamics of a continuum field of exemplar density with non - local interactions , which we call the _ field model_.      here we describe the exemplar model for the case of a single word , where the phonetic value of the exemplars are represented by a single scalar . at any point in time",
    "the state of the system consists of the positions of @xmath11 exemplars @xmath12 , and their respective weights @xmath13 .",
    "initially there are @xmath14 exemplars with fixed positions and weights .",
    "the number of exemplars at time @xmath15 , @xmath16 is non - decreasing , and increases through the creation of new exemplars .",
    "once an exemplar is created , its position does not change and it is never removed from the system , though its weight decreases .",

    "for example , in dialects of english where the cot  caught merger has occurred , not only do the words cot and caught merge , but also the pairs of words don / dawn and nod / gnawed , as well as many others @xcite .",
    "what does our model predict for merger of sounds in real languages ? according to our model , whether two sounds merge or not would depend on how often there was rejection of ambiguous exemplars for any of the minimal pairs distinguished by the two sounds .",
    "a very simple prediction then is that when a pair of sounds has no minimal pairs , and therefore no possible rejected exemplars , the two sounds will merge . likewise ,",
    "when a pair of sounds distinguishes many minimal pairs we expect that merger will not occur . the number of minimal pairs that are contrasted by a pair of vowel sounds is known as the _ functional load _ of the pair @xcite .",
    "the _ functional load hypothesis _ says that the propensity for a pair of sounds to merge is dependent on the function load of the pair , with greater functional load leading to a lower probability of merger ( see , for example , @xcite ) . like other models , including @xcite , our model predicts that the functional load hypothesis will hold .",
    "this hypothesis is tested in @xcite , where the authors perform a corpus study providing strong empirical support for this claim .",
    "the above prediction is based on the assumption that whenever there is a minimal pair for a pair of sounds , there will be rejection of ambiguous exemplars of the words in the pair .",
    "but there is reason to believe that not all minimal pairs are equivalent in evoking exemplar rejection . in situations where context disambiguates which word in a minimal pair an exemplar is",
    ", we might expect that there is no rejection ( or rarer rejection ) of ambiguous exemplars .",
    "for example , if i hear the sentence  you can sleep on the cxt . \" , where x is an ambiguous sound that could make the last word either  cot \" or  caught \" , i can easily infer that ",
    "cot \" is the intended word , since  the \" can not ordinarily be followed by the word  caught \" . more generally , because  cot \" is a noun and  caught \" is verb there are few contexts in which there is a genuine ambiguity between the words .",
    "one might imagine that a minimal pair in which the words are both of the same part of speech ( e.g. noun , verb , adjective ) are more effective at preventing merger of sounds than minimal pairs consisting of pairs of words with different parts of speech .",
    "based on these kinds of considerations , many have predicted that rather than a functional load that merely counts minimal pairs being the best predictor of whether two sounds merge , a functional load in which minimal pairs that are of the same part of speech are weighted more heavily than other minimal pairs would do a better job .",
    "this is in fact borne out by the corpus study @xcite . likewise ,",
    "our model ( and those of other researchers ) predict that minimal pairs consisting of more frequent pairs of words are more effective at predicting merger than those of rare words , and this is again supported by @xcite .",
    "we have provided a model of phonological contrast in which the choice of categorization regimes leads to either the merger of the pronunciation of two words or to its maintenance of their difference .",
    "our major finding is that the pure competition regime does not provide a good model of the preservation of phonological contrast .",
    "when the selection parameter @xmath127 for this regime was set to @xmath157 , simulations showed that the pronunciations merged , albeit over a much longer time interval than for the no - competition regime .",
    "for @xmath144 there were distinct pronunciations , but they had a tendency to move in the opposite direction of the bias towards @xmath35 in the system .",
    "our study provides support for the idea of some sort of exemplar rejection , as in our competition with discards regime and described by labov @xcite and silverman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 5 ) .",
    "in practice , which categorization regime best models the behaviour of hearers in different linguistic contexts is an empirical question that we do not address here .",
    "we refer the reader to the discussion of these issues in ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.5 )    another result we found is that including a bias towards the mean @xmath25 of a category ( @xmath128 , called entrenchment in @xcite ) was not necessary to preserve phonological contrast .",
    "a combination of the pull towards @xmath9 ( the phonetically preferred value of @xmath5 ) together with the interaction between exemplars of the two words was enough to prevent the exemplar distribution from spreading out indefinitely .",
    "of course , this in no way precludes entrenchment from being a real phenomenon in actual language use .",
    "finally we note that , comparing our simulated results to the data in figure  [ fig : peterson_barney ] , a striking difference is that the distribution of exemplars in the experimental data do not fill a roughly circular space , as it does in our results . in our model",
    "we have assumed that phonetic space is homogenous except for a bias towards the origin .",
    "articulatory and acoustic data indicate that there are plenty of inhomogeneities in phonetic space .",
    "a better model of the range of allowable vowels , as considered by @xcite and @xcite is that of a triangle or rectangle , whereas our model imposes no restrictions on utterable sounds but the bias of the speaker towards the centre of the phonetic space causes the used domain to be roughly circular",
    ". we could straightforwardly modify our model to take some of these factors into account but we have not done so here .",
