    "a particularly attractive microfluidic separation technique would be able to exploit the differences in the interactions of the particles with the geometric features embedded within the channels of a micro - device , without the need of an external field .",
    "a few examples of such fluidic - only separation methods include : size - exclusion , entropic trapping @xcite , deterministic lateral displacement using solid obstacles @xcite , and pinched flow fractionation ( pff , @xcite ) .",
    "pff is a relatively simple method , in which species entering a channel constriction then exit into a sudden expansion at different positions across the channel . as a result of its simplicity and promise ,",
    "numerous variants of pff have emerged within the last decade @xcite .",
    "the separation of flow streamlines coming out of the constriction was originally suggested as the basis of pff @xcite .",
    "this explanation , however , does not take into account particle - wall hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "two factors indicate the importance of considering hydrodynamic interactions to determine the particle trajectories through a constriction .",
    "first , the particles are similar in size to the width of the constriction and , therefore , can not be considered as tracer particles advected by the flow @xcite .",
    "second , as the particles move through the constriction , the surface - to - surface separation between the particles and the channel wall tend to becomes much smaller that the size of the particles , and lubrication forces can play a significant role .",
    "studying the motion of a particle through a constriction is also relevant in the context of certain particle focusing methods @xcite and micro - models of porous media employed in particle deposition studies @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied the relationship between the initial offset in a particle trajectory ( @xmath0 in figure [ fig : systemgeometrylb2](a ) ) and the minimum surface - to - surface separation between the particle and the obstacle along the trajectory .",
    "we have shown that even a moderate initial offset in a particle trajectory ( say , comparable to the particle radius ) leads to surface - to - surface separations that are significantly small , e.g. , @xmath1 between a particle and an obstacle of micrometer size @xcite .",
    "the occurence of such small surface - to - surface separations highlights the importance of short - range non - hydrodynamic interactions , and suggests the minimum separation as the relevant length - scale to compare with their range .",
    "such interactions can be modeled using a hard - wall repulsion , which leads to the definition of a _",
    "critical offset _",
    ", i.e. , the smallest initial offset that results in a fore - aft symmetric trajectory @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the relationship between the critical offset and the range of repulsive interactions is the same as that between the initial offset and the minimum surface - to - surface separation @xcite . in previous lattice boltzmann simulations ( @xcite , henceforth _ paper i _ ) we studied the trajectory followed by a spherical particle as it passes through a constriction created by a spherical obstacle of _ the same size _ and a plane wall .",
    "for the same initial offset , we showed that a particle reaches closer to the obstacle as the constriction aperture decreases .",
    "therefore , the critical offset increases with decresing constriction aperture .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the motion of particles of _ unequal sizes _ as they move through a constriction .",
    "we show that irreversible particle - wall interactions could lead to _ size - based separation _ at low reynolds number .",
    "particularly , we show that particles of different sizes exhibit different extents of lateral displacement as they move through a constriction .",
    "we present the results of lattice boltzmann simulations for various particle - obstacle aspect ratios and sizes of the constriction aperture in the stokes regime ( negligible particle and fluid inertia ) .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the critical offset on the driving field ; we simulate the trajectories resulting from a constant force driving the particles in a quiescent fluid as well as those in which a suspended particle moves with a pressure - driven flow .",
    "based on the hard - wall model , we show that larger particles exhibit a larger critical offset in the presence of a non - hydrodynamic repulsion of fixed range . therefore , size - based separation by employing the motion of particles through a constriction can be qualitatively explained through this study .",
    "further , we show that decreasing the constriction aperture also increases the critical offset , with the increment being larger for the case of a pressure - driven flow carrying the particles .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in  [ sec : sysdeflb2 ] , we introduce the system under investigation , as well as the nature of the simulations carried out .",
    "we discuss the hard - core model for short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions in  [ sec : hardcoremodellb2 ] .",

    "we vary the constriction aperture by translating the obstacle center along @xmath12-axis towards the top - wall .",

    ". we use a larger obstacle in the fixed-@xmath4 simulations to achieve a smaller minimum separation ( @xmath18 lattice unit @xmath20 @xmath21 ) . the fixed offset simulations exhibit different minimum separations , whereas the fixed-@xmath4 simulations exhibit different final offsets .",
    "both cases probe the dependence of the respective variables on the constriction aperture and particle size .",
    "we investigate the effect of two driving fields : a constant force driving the particles in a quiescent fluid , and freely suspended particles moving with a pressure - driven flow ( under a constant pressure - drop ) . in both sets of simulations ,",
    "the obstacle radius serves as the characteristic length scale of the problem . as mentioned earlier , the magnitudes of particle as well as fluid inertia are negligible in all simulations ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .    the particle - to - obstacle aspect ratio @xmath24 and the dimensionless constriction aperture @xmath25 form the parameter space relevant to this study .",
    "we use four different particle sizes , @xmath26 lattice units , yielding the particle - to - obstacle aspect ratios @xmath27 for fixed offset simulations , and @xmath28 for fixed-@xmath4 simulations .",
    "note that the values of @xmath29 are different for the two sets of simulations due to different obstacle radii .",
    "in the fixed offset simulations , we investigate the constriction apertures @xmath30 and @xmath31 lattice units ( @xmath32 decreasing to @xmath33 ) , and also investigate the trajectories in the absence of the top wall ( the latter corresponding to the absence of a constriction ) . for the fixed-@xmath4 simulations , the sizes of the constriction apertures are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 lattice units ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the initial and final offsets are noted at @xmath39 and @xmath40 lattice units , respectively . for each fixed-@xmath4 simulation , the initial @xmath12-coordinate of the particle center",
    "is calculated such that approximately the same minimum surface - to - surface separation is attained by particles of all sizes .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : introlb2 ] , the minimum separation attained along a particle trajectory ( @xmath4 in figure [ fig : systemgeometrylb2](c ) ) serves as the length scale that should be compared with the range of short - range non - hydrodynamic interactions to estimate their effect on the trajectory .",
    "thus , in what follows we present the results obtained for the minimum separation @xmath4 as a function of the particle - obstacle aspect ratio and constriction aperture .",
    "following paper i , we model the short - range repulsive ( irreversible ) interactions between a particle - obstacle pair ( such as solid - solid contact due to surface roughness ) , as a hard - wall potential creating a hard - core shell of effective range @xmath41 , such that , any surface - to - surface separation between the particle and the obstacle less than @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) is not attainable .",
    "we have established that this model leads to the definition of a critical offset @xmath43 that depends on the range of the non - hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "the existence of the critical offset can be rationalized as follows : the presence of non - hydrodynamic interactions with a dimensionless range @xmath41 around the obstacle prevents the particle surface to approach the obstacle surface closer than @xmath41 .",
    "then , the particle trajectories corresponding to @xmath44 are unaffected by the presence of the non - hydrodynamic interactions ( see the top - most trajectory in figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisionsnoinertialb2 ] ) . the trajectory that corresponds to a minimum surface - to - surface separation @xmath45 serves as the _ critical trajectory _ ( see the middle trajectory in figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisionsnoinertialb2 ] ) . finally , the trajectories that would have approached a minimum surface - to - surface separation @xmath42 in the absence of the non - hydrodynamic interactions , are forced to circumnavigate the obstacle while maintaining a constant separation equal to @xmath41 due to the hard - wall repulsion .",
    "these trajectories collapse onto the critical trajectory downstream of the obstacle ( see the bottom - most trajectory in figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisionsnoinertialb2 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the critical offset @xmath43 can be defined as the _ smallest initial offset that results in a symmetric particle trajectory around the obstacle_. further , since the minimum separation attained by a particle moving along the critical trajectory is exactly @xmath45 , from the above definition , the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath41 is the same as that between @xmath0 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "versus the dimensionless particle radius @xmath29 for different driving fields : ( a)a constant force acting on the particle in a quiescent fluid , ( b ) a constant pressure drop acting on the fluid with freely suspended particle ]    figure [ fig : ximinvsalpha_noinertiaandd60 ] shows @xmath4 as a function of the particle size , for the two different driving fields . in figure",
    "[ fig : ximinvsalpha_noinertiaandd60](a ) , we plot the case when the particle is driven by a constant force in a quiescent fluid .",
    "figure [ fig : ximinvsalpha_noinertiaandd60](b ) on the other hand , represents the pressure - driven case . in both cases",
    "we observe that , @xmath4 decreases with increasing particle size for a constant constriction aperture and also with decreasing constriction aperture for a fixed particle size .",
    "the latter observation extends the results presented in paper i for a particle of the same size as the obstacle .",
    "note that , we have shown via theoretical calculations that the minimum separation as a function of the particle size reverses its trend for asymptotically small separations in the absence of a constriction ( @xmath46 ) , so that smaller particles reach closer to the obstacle @xcite",
    ". however , these separations are not relevant in practice , since they are much smaller than the range of typical irreversible forces for micrometer size particles . comparing figures [ fig : ximinvsalpha_noinertiaandd60](a ) and ( b ) , we note that a given particle reaches closer to the obstacle when moving due to a constant force in a quiescent fluid , than a pressure - driven flow .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis based on the hydrodynamic mobility of a sphere around an obstacle , in the absence of the wall creating the constriction @xcite . in summary",
    "we conclude that _ the particles reach closer to the obstacle upon decreasing the constriction aperture , or increasing the particle size .",
    "_    let us now discuss the implications of the hard - wall potential model . as mentioned earlier in  [ sec : sysdeflb2 ] , all trajectories in this set have the same initial offset @xmath0 , and the obstacle radius @xmath6 is constant ( @xmath17 lattice units ) .",
    "let the corresponding critical offset be @xmath47 for a given a given particle radius and constriction aperture @xmath48 .",
    "we first discuss the effect of decreasing the constriction aperture keeping the particle radius constant ( i.e. , following the direction of the downward arrow in figure [ fig : ximinvsalpha_noinertiaandd60 ] ) .",
    "since we have observed that @xmath4 decreases with the constriction aperture , for a sufficiently small aperture @xmath49 , the minimum separation would , in principle , reach the range of the non - hydrodynamic interactions ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the critical offset would increase from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , _ for a given particle radius , the corresponding critical offset increases with decreasing constriction aperture_. we note that this result is in qualitative agreement with previous experiments @xcite , and extends the results obtained for @xmath53 ( paper i ) to @xmath54 .",
    "the above inference was drawn using a fixed @xmath29 and varying the constriction aperture @xmath55 .",
    "an analogous argument can be made using the particle radius @xmath5 as a variable , wherein the minimum separation is observed to decrease with increasing particle radius .",
    "therefore , _ a decrease in @xmath4 due to increasing the particle radius for a given constriction aperture , results in an increase in the critical offset @xmath43 in the presence of non - hydrodynamic interactions_. however , in this case , we need to assume that the non - hydrodynamic interactions have a fixed dimensionless range @xmath56 , set by the obstacle and independent of particle size .",
    "therefore , in general , a decrease in the minimum separation ( @xmath57 ) in the absence of non - hydrodynamic interactions , can be translated as an increase in the critical offset ( @xmath58 ) in their presence . in the following section",
    ", we indeed show this to be the case by direct verification using the fixed-@xmath4 simulations .",
    "the objective of this set of simulations is to investigate the dependence of @xmath13 on the parameters of the problem when the minimum separation is kept constant . specifically , we perform simulations that correspond to a minimum separation of @xmath18 lattice unit , i.e. , @xmath59 ( for @xmath19 lattice units ) . we know that , the functional relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath4 is the same as that between @xmath43 and @xmath41 @xcite",
    ". therefore , the final offsets @xmath13 corresponding to the various trajectories obtained in these simulations are the values of the critical offset @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath61 .     between the particle and the obstacle as a function of the dimensionless @xmath8-coordinate .",
    "as mentioned in the text , two simulations for each particle size are carried out for the purposes of linear interpolation , such that both attain minimum separation close to @xmath62 ( one less than @xmath63 , and the other greater than @xmath63 ) .",
    "four different line - styles correspond to the four particle sizes used in the simulations .",
    "the two groups of trajectories ( one corresponding to @xmath64 and the other corresponding to @xmath65 ) can be clearly seen in the figure .",
    "this particular plot depicts the case when @xmath19 lattice units , @xmath66 and the particles are carried around the obstacle by pressure - driven flow . ]    however , as shown in figure [ fig : xivsxflowd3lb2 ] , our simulated trajectories attain the minimum separation of @xmath63 only approximately .",
    "therefore , for each particle size , we compute the final offset corresponding to @xmath62 by linear interpolation between two independent simulations for which @xmath4 is greater and smaller than 0.05 , leading to the error - bars shown in figure [ fig : bcvsalb2 ] .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : bcvsalb2 ] that the critical offset increases with the size of the particle ( an inference already stated in  [ subsec : setisimresultslb2 ] ) , qualitatively corroborating earlier experimental observations @xcite .",
    "we again compare the effect of the field driving the particle past the obstacle .",
    "figure [ fig : bcvsalb2](a ) corresponds to a particle driven by a constant force , whereas figure [ fig : bcvsalb2](b ) shows the results for pressure - driven flow .",
    "we observe that the driving field significantly affects the critical offset : in general , higher critical offsets are observed for the case of a constant force driving the particle in a quiescent fluid .",
    "this is consistent with the argument presented in ",
    "[ subsec : setisimresultslb2 ] that a given particle reaches closer to the obstacle when driven by a constant force compared to a pressure - driven flow .",
    "figure [ fig : bcvsalb2 ] also shows that decreasing the constriction aperture affects the case of fluid flow more than the case of a constant force driving the particles .",
    "further , in previous experimental findings we have observed that the increment in the critical offset itself increases with particle size @xcite .",
    "however , the increment observed in the experiments is smaller than the resolution of the current data ( i.e. , the error bars depicted in the figure ) .",
    "therefore , we can not conclusively confirm the experimental findings with the available simulation data .     as a function of the particle radius .",
    "the critical offset is evaluated at @xmath61 by linear interpolation between two simulated trajectories for each particle size , leading to the error - bars depicted above .",
    "( a ) a constant force drives the particles past the obstacle in a quiescent fluid , ( b ) a constant pressure drop drives the fluid carrying the particle past the obstacle . ]",
    "we have established that the critical offset @xmath43 increases with increasing particle size , and/or decreasing the constriction aperture .",
    "particularly , we have concluded that , for the same constriction aperture , two particles of different sizes would exhibit different critical offsets . from the perspective of size - based separations , and for",
    "the sake of specificity , let @xmath67 and @xmath68 be the values of these critical offsets for particles of radii @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath71 , then from the previous discussion , it follows that @xmath72 , assuming the same range of non - hydrodynamic interactions @xmath41 ( such as the amplitude of surface roughness ) . if these particles are made to move past the obstacle with the same initial offset satisfying @xmath73 , the larger particle would get displaced onto the critical trajectory and would travel with a final offset @xmath68 , while the smaller particle would not get affected by the non - hydrodynamic interactions , and continue with the final offset @xmath0 , thus separating the two particles spatially , along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "another possibility would be an initial offset satisfying @xmath74 , which leads to separation since both particles would move along the corresponding critical trajectories downstream to the obstacle .",
    "the lateral displacement between the two particles in this case is @xmath75 and is larger than that in the previous case ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) .",
    "therefore , the spatial resolution of separation corresponding to this latter possibility is maximum .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : bcvsalb2 ] , the critical offset is more sensitive to changes in particle radii in the pressure - driven case a constant force",
    ". therefore , the spatial resolution would be higher between the two particles when the driving field is the fluid flow .",
    "in summary , we have studied the behavior of spherical particles of different sizes moving in a channel through a constriction between a fixed spherical obstacle and a plane wall .",
    "we have investigated cases pertaining to different particle - to - obstacle aspect ratios and constriction apertures .",
    "we observe that the particles reach closer to the obstacle as the particle size increases or the constriction aperture reduces in size .",
    "our simulations also show that a particle driven by a constant force in a quiescent fluid reaches closer to the obstacle than the one moving with a pressure - driven flow .",
    "however , in the case of a pressure - drop driven flow , we observe a larger range of change in @xmath43 .",
    "we have discussed the implications of these observations assuming that a hard - wall potential model fairly represents the repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions . we have inferred that particle reaching closer to the obstacle ( as a function of particle size or the constriction aperture ) is equivalent to increasing the critical offset associated with the particle .",
    "such dependence of the critical offset on the particle size serves as the basis for size - based separation . finally , the separation resolution is higher in the case of a fluid flow driving the particles than a constant force in a quiescent fluid .",
