    "the observation of two large gamma - ray lobes in the fermi - lat data , extending about @xmath1 above and below the galactic centre  @xcite , has generated a lot of interest regarding its origin in possible astrophysical processes .",
    "recently , by studying the variation of the gamma - ray spectrum in these fermi bubbles with galactic latitude , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that far away from the galactic plane , above latitudes of about @xmath2 , the spectrum can be explained by inverse compton scattering of the interstellar radiation with cosmic ray electrons . on the otherhand , within around @xmath3 of the galactic plane ,",
    "the spectrum is found to have a peak at energies of 1 - 4 gev , which is a feature difficult to explain by the same mechanism with a realistic electron population  @xcite . as possible explanations of the non - inverse compton component , cosmic ray protons scattering with gas , a large population of millisecond pulsars and dark matter annihilations have been studied by comparing their predictions with the low latitude emission , after subtracting the inverse compton component  @xcite .",
    "the resulting gamma ray spectrum from dark matter ( dm ) annihilation is found to provide a good fit to the background subtracted low latitude data , using a generalized navarro - frenk - white profile for dm distribution , with a slightly steeper inner slope of 1.2 , and a local dm density of @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the possible dm mass and annihilation rate include a 10 gev dm annihilating to @xmath6 , with an annihilation rate @xmath7 , or a 50 gev dm annihilating to @xmath8 , with @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "for details on the extraction of this possible signal , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , and for alternative possibilities of dm annihilation modes to ref .",
    "the annihilating dm model discussed above can also account for gamma ray emissions with similar spectral features previously identified close to the galactic centre  @xcite .    in the r - parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the lightest neutralino , @xmath10 , is a viable dm candidate , whose mass can range from a few gev to several tev .",
    "the neutralino dm in all mass range have been studied as a possible thermal relic in specific models of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking as well as in a general phenomenological mssm  @xcite . in particular , lower bounds on the mass of a light neutralino dm ( @xmath10 ) have been obtained in the mssm under various assumptions , taking into account constraints from accelerator , flavour physics and direct detection experiments . in general , although a light @xmath11 neutralino is allowed by most constraints , the requirement of a sufficiently large thermally averaged annihilation cross - section at the epoch of its freeze - out in the early universe ( so that dm is not over - abundant in the present epoch ) , brings in a certain amount of tension in the mssm parameter space . however , possible alternative thermal histories of the universe , for instance , the effect of late - time decay of a heavy particle like moduli into light states ( without disturbing the successful big - bang nucleosynthesis ) , have also been discussed in various contexts , which can revive parameter points in which the dm relic density is otherwise predicted to be larger  @xcite .    motivated by the analysis of the gamma - ray data in the fermi bubble discussed above , and the possibility that light dm annihilation can provide a second emission mechanism necessary to explain the features of the non - inverse - compton component",
    ", we revisit the case for a 10 gev neutralino dm ( @xmath10 ) annihilating to @xmath6 in the context of the mssm .",
    "the dominant contribution to this annihilation process in the mssm comes from the exchange of scalar partners of tau leptons ( stau ) , and therefore , the requirement of an annihilation rate of @xmath12 constrains the model parameters in the stau sector , namely the stau masses @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the mixing angle @xmath15 .",
    "interestingly , the same set of mssm parameters in the stau sector determine the dominant susy contribution to the higgs boson ( @xmath16 ) decay rate to two photons measured at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "both the @xmath10 annihilation rate to @xmath17 and the @xmath18 decay width are enhanced in presence of a light @xmath19 , a large mixing @xmath15 between the stau current eigenstates and a large mass splitting @xmath20 .",
    "the central value of the @xmath18 signal strength measured by atlas is @xmath21 ( although consistent at @xmath22 with the sm prediction and the cms measurement ) , and hence there is a possibility that evidence for new physics might show up in this channel in the future lhc runs .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is therefore to correlate these two observables and find out the parameter region in the stau sector consistent with both of them .",
    "the stau masses and mixing angle are , however , constrained by lep direct search for stau pair production , as well as electroweak precision measurements .",
    "we revisit both these constraints in our study . using the lep stau search limits , we clarify the mixing angle dependence of the bound on @xmath19 mass , and from the electroweak precision constraints , we determine the allowed splitting between the mass eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "although from lep constraints on chargino mass and the @xmath24-boson total invisible width , a @xmath25 gev @xmath10 has to be dominantly bino - like , it can still have a small higgsino fraction .",
    "moreover , recent bounds on the chargino mass from the 8 tev lhc , as well as the current upper bound on the higgs boson invisible branching ratio obtained from a global fit of the lhc higgs measurements can lead to more stringent constraints on the higgsino fraction of a 10 gev neutralino , depending upon the values of some other susy parameters . after determining the allowed higgsino fraction taking all these constraints into account , we comment on its implications for the @xmath10 annihilation cross - section to tau leptons . combined with the current limits on the first two generation slepton masses from the atlas collaboration ,",
    "this bound on the higgsino fraction also has implications for the relic density of the @xmath10 , its direct detection rate , and the susy contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath26 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : constraints ] we discuss the constraints on the relevant mssm parameters .",
    "we study @xmath10 annihilation to @xmath6 in the present universe and determine the stau masses and mixing necessary to reproduce the annihilation rate @xmath27 in section  [ sec : annihilation ] . in section  [ sec : higgs ] , we correlate these parameters with the @xmath18 decay rate , after including the stau loop contributions . taking into account the current constraints on slepton masses , the relic density of a @xmath25 gev @xmath10",
    "is briefly discussed in section  [ sec : relic ] , while the mssm contribution to the muon @xmath26 in this context is evaluated in section  [ sec : muon ] .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we revisit the present constraints on the mssm parameters which will be crucial to our study .",
    "the most important parameters are the stau masses and mixing , which determine both the annihilation cross section @xmath28 as well as the possible enhancement of @xmath29 .",
    "we also discuss the bounds on the higgsino fraction of a 10  gev neutralino , combined limits on the first two generation slepton masses from lep and recent atlas results , and the lep2 and recent lhc limits on charginos .",
    "the stau mass eigenstates , @xmath30 , are linear combinations of the current eigenstates @xmath31 .",
    "we take the masses @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the mixing angle @xmath15 as the free parameters in the stau sector .",
    "the relationship between the soft susy breaking parameters and the masses and mixing angle are reviewed in appendix  [ sleptonmixing ] .",

    "these constraints restrict the value of the @xmath68 parameter depending upon the choice of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and therefore imply an upper bound on the higgsino fraction of a @xmath25 gev @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the recent chargino mass bound from lhc in presence of a light stau puts stronger constraints on @xmath71 , as seen in section  [ slepton ] .",
    "we take the minimum value of @xmath72 gev , making a conservative estimate based on the chargino mass constraint from the lhc and briefly discuss the implications of this small higgsino fraction in @xmath10 .",
    "we define the higgsino fraction of the lightest neutralino @xmath10 as @xmath73 from the expansion @xmath74 defined in eq.([mass - eigen ] ) of appendix  [ app1 ] , and accordingly the gaugino fraction as @xmath75 .    in table",
    "[ muvary ] , we show the effect of varying @xmath71 , and hence the gaugino - higgsino fractions of a @xmath25 gev @xmath10 , on @xmath76 ( the cross - sections have been obtained using micromegas-3.2 ) .",
    "all other relevant parameters have been fixed as : @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 , @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 is chosen to be rather large , since as we shall see in section  [ sec : muon ] , in order to explain the muon @xmath26 anomaly within @xmath84 with a chargino and smuon mass spectrum consistent with the recent atlas bounds , @xmath70 is required to be greater than 20 .",
    "the stau mass splitting is kept fixed while varying @xmath71 by choosing appropriate values of the trilinear scalar soft term @xmath85 .",
    "as we can see from this table , the higgsino fraction is rather small for @xmath86 gev ( 1.5% ) , and as the higgsino fraction decreases , the annihilation rate to @xmath17 also decreases for this choice of @xmath70 .",
    "there is also a @xmath70 dependence of @xmath87 because the higgsino components ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) couple to @xmath90 with the yukawa coupling , @xmath91 , which grows with @xmath70 ( the bino component of @xmath10 ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) couples to @xmath90 with the @xmath94 gauge coupling of @xmath95 ) . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath97 is significantly smaller than the gauge coupling , while for @xmath83 they become comparable ( @xmath98 ) . in the above parameter choices ,",
    "if we just change @xmath70 from 30 to 10 , keeping the other parameters fixed , for @xmath99 , although the gaugino and higgsino fractions remain almost the same ( 0.992 and 0.008 respectively ) , @xmath76 now becomes @xmath100/s .",
    "therefore , in order to match the neutralino annihilation rate with the fermi bubble data , having a small higgsino fraction for @xmath101 and a relatively large @xmath70 will be helpful , since it opens up a parameter region in the stau sector with a somewhat larger @xmath102 or smaller mixing angles .",
    "in the mssm , the effective higgs coupling to two photons is mediated by the @xmath103 boson , charged fermions , charged scalar fermions , charged higgs boson and chargino loops . in this study , among the susy particles , we focus on the stau loops , which can give rise to a significant contribution to the two photon decay width @xcite , together with the dominant @xmath103 boson and the top quark loops .    before discussing the stau effects in detail ,",
    "we briefly explain why we expect a large positive contribution from the staus and why the chargino contribution is expected to be small even for a lighter chargino mass close to the lep bound .",
    "the two photon decay width of the lighter cp even higgs boson in the decoupling limit through the charged scalar fermions and charginos loops in addition to the dominant @xmath103 and the top loops is given by  @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the spin @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath62 amplitudes , respectively , and are expressed at the leading order by the following functions :    [ loopamplitude ] @xmath110/\\tau^2   = -7 - \\frac{22}{15}\\tau + o(\\tau^2)\\\\ a_{1/2}(\\tau)&= 2\\bigl [ \\tau+(\\tau-1)\\arcsin^2{\\sqrt{\\tau } } \\bigr]/\\tau^2 = \\frac{4}{3 } + \\frac{14}{45}\\tau + o(\\tau^2 ) \\\\",

    "both the spin of a loop particle and the sign of the coefficient @xmath119 , therefore , decide the interference with the dominant @xmath103 boson loop . in principle , how a loop particle affects the higgs decay rate depends on whether its mass is increased or decreased by the existence of the higgs field  @xcite .",
    "let us first examine the chargino contribution .",
    "since the charginos are fermions , they should work constructively with the top quark if their masses are increased by the higgs field .",
    "the charginos are the mass eigenstates of the winos @xmath120 , each having a soft susy breaking mass @xmath69 , and the charged higgsinos @xmath121 , @xmath122 , with a supersymmetric higgsino mass @xmath68 .",
    "the mixing of these current states is caused by the electroweak symmetry breaking when the higgs fields acquire vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "since the mass of the lighter chargino is always decreased by the mixing , while that of the heavier chargino is always increased , we may expect that the effect of the two charginos tend to cancel each other . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the dimensionless coefficients @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) , for @xmath125 , are approximately given by @xmath126 while for @xmath127 , @xmath128 these approximate forms of the coefficients show that the relationship @xmath129 can always be satisfied , and since the dependence of the loop amplitudes on the loop particle mass is small for @xmath130 gev ( eq .",
    "( [ loopamplitude ] ) ) , the effects of the two charginos are comparable , and tend to cancel each other .",
    "therefore , the chargino contribution is negligible even when the mass of the lighter chargino is close to the lep bound .",
    "we now turn to the stau contribution .",
    "the mass terms for the stau current eigenstates @xmath131 are given by    [ staumass2 ] @xmath132    where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the soft susy breaking masses .",
    "the 2nd and 3rd terms in eqs .",
    "( [ staumass2 ] ) come from the supersymmetric d- and f- terms , respectively , once the higgs fields acquire vev s . in the absence of mixing between @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath137 and @xmath138 . for @xmath139 , @xmath137 and @xmath138",

    "( [ staumass2 ] ) . from this",
    "fact and @xmath140 as in eq .",
    "( [ loopamplitude ] ) , we can naively expect that both @xmath135 and @xmath136 contribute to the two photon decay width in the opposite direction to the dominant @xmath103 boson loop , resulting in a suppression of the decay rate .",
    "this changes once we consider the mixing between @xmath141 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 where the 1st and 2nd terms arise , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , from the soft susy breaking term and the supersymmetric f - term respectively .",
    "if the mass of the lightest stau @xmath144 is decreased by @xmath145 more than the amount of its increase by the 2nd and 3rd terms in eqs .",
    "( [ staumass2 ] ) , @xmath49 can work constructively with the dominant @xmath103 loop , resulting in an enhancement of the decay rate .",
    "this enhancement by @xmath49 depends only on the magnitude of @xmath145 , and not on the overall sign .",
    "however , using a similar argument , the heavier stau @xmath146 can not work constructively with the @xmath103 boson loop , and will thus suppress the decay rate .",
    "the exact form of the higgs coupling to the staus , @xmath147 , can be expressed as @xcite    [ ghstaustau ] @xmath148,\\\\ g_{\\tilde{\\tau}_2}^{h } = \\frac{1}{m_{\\tilde{\\tau}_2}^2 } \\biggl [ m_{\\tau}^2 + m_z^2\\bigl(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta_{\\tilde{\\tau } } - \\sin^2\\theta_w \\cos2\\theta_{\\tilde{\\tau } } \\bigr)\\cos2\\beta + \\frac{m_{\\tau}}{2}\\bigl(a_{\\tau } - \\mu \\tan\\beta\\bigr ) \\sin2\\theta_{\\tilde{\\tau } } \\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath149 is given by @xmath150 the combination @xmath151 in @xmath147 of eqs .",

    "since the sm value of @xmath108 is consistent at the @xmath22 level with both the current measurements , no conclusion can be drawn at the moment from the data . however , since the atlas data continues to show an enhancement in the central value , future improvement of this measurement may provide the first hint of new physics in higgs properties .    from figure  [ plotdm1 ] , we can see the correlation between this decay rate and the neutralino annihilation rate to tau pairs .",
    "two important differences between these two observables are that even though the di - photon branching fraction also increases with @xmath167 , but unlike in the case of @xmath178 , it does not reach an asymptotic value for some @xmath167 . in addition , the diphoton branching fraction is symmetric about @xmath48 , while @xmath87 is not .",
    "we emphasize that the region of the @xmath179 parameter space favored by the dm annihilation rate @xmath180 overlaps with the region which enhances the @xmath181 rate .",

    "@xcite that a 10 gev @xmath10 can satisfy the relic density constraint if all the slepton masses are close to the lep bound .",

    "since the coupling of a bino - like @xmath10 to sleptons is proportional to their hypercharge , the contribution of @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) to @xmath185 is @xmath188 times larger than that of a @xmath189 of the same mass .",
    "combining this with the fact that the atlas bound on @xmath189 is stronger ( @xmath190 gev ) , we conclude that for achieving a higher value of @xmath185 , it is better to interpret the atlas bound as @xmath191 gev with @xmath189 decoupled , rather than taking the common bound of 320 gev on all first two generation sleptons .",

    "late - time decays of heavy fields can produce relativistic particles and entropy , thereby diluting the relic density of dm produced at the time of freeze - out .",
    "a particularly motivated example of such long - lived massive particles is moduli .",
    "the generic requirements in such a scenario are that : 1 ) the decay of the heavy particle should reheat the universe to a temperature ( @xmath212 ) which is below the dm freeze - out temperature ( @xmath213 ) ; 2 ) @xmath212 should be higher than the temperature scale in which big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) takes place ; and 3 ) in a susy theory , the decay branching fraction of the heavy particle to gauginos ( especially , in our case , @xmath10 ) , should be very small , so as not to produce more dm from the decay .",

[ g-2data ] ) even for a very light bino ( @xmath25 gev ) , if the trilinear term @xmath286 is of the same order as @xmath85 which gives the desired bino annihilation rate .",
    "to summarize our study , we consider the possibility that a component of the low - latitude emission in the fermi bubble gamma ray data can originate from a 10 gev dm particle annihilating to @xmath17 with @xmath287 .",
    "we explore @xmath10 pair - annihilation to @xmath6 via stau exchange diagrams , and determine the region in the ( @xmath288 ) parameter space which can accommodate the above data .",
    "it is found that the stau mixing plays a major role in enhancing @xmath87 , and for a given @xmath13 and @xmath15 , @xmath87 increases with @xmath20 , reaching an asymptotic value at around @xmath289 gev . to determine the constraints in the stau sector , we revisit the lep direct search bound on @xmath13 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we also use the electroweak precision constraints to find that upto @xmath290 gev with a light @xmath19 and significant mixing @xmath15 , the contribution of the stau loops to the oblique parameters are consistent with the data .",
    "we also verified that the necessary stau mass splitting and mixing angle are compatible with the requirements of vacuum meta - stability . after taking into account the constraints on the higgsino mass parameter @xmath68 , and hence on the higgsino admixture to a bino - like @xmath10 , coming from the upper bounds on the @xmath24 and higgs boson invisible widths as well as the bound on chargino mass from lhc in a scenario with a light stau , we go on to explore the implications of this small higgsino fraction to the annihilation rate",
    ".    one of the main results of our paper is the correlation of @xmath66 with @xmath29 , since both these observables depend crucially on @xmath291 and @xmath167 .",
    "we find that both are enhanced in presence of a light @xmath19 and large mixing @xmath15 , and there are regions in the @xmath166 parameter space which can accommodate both the required annihilation rate as well as the possibility of an enhanced higgs decay rate to two photons .",
    "in particular , for @xmath19 masses obeying the most stringent lower bound from lep ( opal ) , in the parameter region consistent with the best - fit value of the annihilation rate , @xmath29 is always found to be enhanced .",
    "the dependence on the sign of @xmath15 is however found to be different .",
    "for the same @xmath13 and @xmath167 , @xmath87 is larger for @xmath292 , but @xmath29 is symmetric about @xmath293 .",
    "since the allowed higgsino fraction of a 10 gev @xmath10 is rather small , and the recent atlas susy search results put stringent bounds on the first two generation sleptons ( @xmath294 gev ) , we find that it is difficult to achieve a sufficiently large annihilation rate @xmath185 , required to reproduce the observed value of the dm relic density . to avoid the problem of dm over - abundance",
    ", a non - standard thermal history of the universe may be required , in which the late time decay of a heavy field like moduli reheats the universe to a temperature below the dm freeze - out temperature .",
    "taking an example mssm mass spectrum in our scenario , we find that the required value is of the order of @xmath216 gev , which is sufficiently above the epoch of bbn",
    ". a decay of a moduli field of mass around 1 pev can give rise to such a @xmath212 , and the branching fraction of such a moduli field to susy particles is also negligibly small , @xmath218 .",
    "since in many well - motivated theoretical scenarios the thermal history of the universe can be modified , the mssm parameter space explored in this study can be made consistent with the relic density requirement .",
    "finally , we estimate the mssm contribution to the muon @xmath26 taking into account all the experimental constraints on the mssm spectrum , in particular , the recent atlas bounds on the smuon and chargino masses .",
    "we find that even though the bino - like neutralino is significantly light , the bino contribution is unlikely to account for the discrepancy .",
    "however , it is possible to explain the anomaly within @xmath84 by the chargino and muon - sneutrino loop alone with a somewhat larger value of @xmath70 ( @xmath295 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to look for signals of a light stau with a mass less than about 130 gev in the future lhc data , in final states with boosted tau leptons and missing energy .",
    "if in addition , with the accumulation of large statistics , the lsp and nlsp masses could be estimated , that would lead to a direct test of the scenario considered in our study .",
    "indirect hints might also be forthcoming in the future lhc measurement of the @xmath18 signal strength with a much better accuracy .",
    "it is also very important to see if a similar hint is found in the future fermi - lat gamma ray data from dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which are much cleaner probes for studying signals of annihilating dm .",
