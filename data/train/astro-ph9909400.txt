    "it is becoming increasingly apparent that isolated neutron stars come in many flavors besides traditional radio pulsars . in recent years",
    ", the neutron star zoo has widened to include @xmath310 radio - quiet neutron stars ( @xcite ) , six anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; @xcite ) and four soft @xmath4-ray repeaters ( sgrs ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is much uncertainty and debate as to the nature of these sources ; one way towards characterizing their properties is through associations with supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "an association with a snr gives an independent estimate of a neutron star s age and distance , while the position of the neutron star with respect to the snr s center can be used to estimate the transverse space velocity of the compact object .",
    "a case in point are the axps .",
    "some authors propose that the axps are accreting systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while others argue that axps are `` magnetars '' , isolated neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields , @xmath5  g ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the association of the axp  1e  1841045 with the very young ( @xmath22  kyr ) snr  g27.4 + 0.0 ( @xcite ) makes the case that 1e  1841045 is a young object . assuming that the pulsar was born spinning quickly , it is difficult to see how accretion could have slowed it down to its current period in such a short time",
    "this result thus favors the magnetar model for 1e  1841045 , and indeed the magnetic field inferred from its period and period derivative , and assuming standard pulsar spin - down , is @xmath6  g.    ( also called ax  j1844.80258 ) is a 6.97  sec x - ray pulsar , found serendipitously in an _ asca _  observation of the ( presumably unassociated ) snr  g29.70.3 ( @xcite , hereafter gv98 ; @xcite , hereafter t98 ) . the long pulse period , low galactic latitude and soft spectrum of  led gv98 and t98 to independently propose that this source is an axp ( a conclusion which still needs to be confirmed through measurement of a period derivative ) . the high hydrogen column density inferred from photoelectric absorption (",
    "@xmath7  @xmath8 ) suggests that  is distant ; t98 put it in the scutum arm , with a consequent distance of 8.5  kpc , while gv98 nominate 15  kpc .",
    "because  was discovered at the very edge of the _ asca _  gis field - of - view , its position from these observations could only be crudely estimated , with an uncertainty of @xmath9 . a subsequent ( 1999  march )",
    "50  ks on - axis _ asca _  observation has since been carried out ( @xcite ) .",

    "significant variations in the flux density of  were also reported by t98 .",
    "the region containing  has been surveyed at 1.4  ghz as part of the nvss ( @xcite ) .",
    "an image from this survey shows a @xmath10 shell near the position of the pulsar .",
    "we here report on multi - frequency polarimetric observations of this radio shell , at substantially higher sensitivity and spatial resolution than offered by the nvss .",
    "our observations and analysis are described in  [ sec_obs ] , and the resulting images are presented in ",
    "[ sec_results ] . in  [ sec_discuss ]",
    "we argue that the radio shell coincident with is a new snr , and consider the likelihood of an association between the two sources .",
    "radio observations of the field of  were made with the d - configuration of the very large array ( vla ) on 1999 march 26 .",
    "the total observing time was 6  hr , of which 4.5  hr was spent observing in the 5  ghz band , and the remainder in the 8  ghz band .",
    "5  ghz observations consisted of a 100  mhz bandwidth centered on 4.860  ghz ; 8  ghz observations were similar , but centered on 8.460  ghz .",
    "amplitudes were calibrated by observations of 3c  286 , assuming flux densities of 7.5 and 5.2  jy at 5  ghz and 8  ghz respectively .",
    "antenna gains and instrumental polarization were calibrated using regular observations of mrc  1801 + 010 .",
    "four stokes parameters ( rr , ll , rl , lr ) were recorded in all observations . to cover the entire region of interest ,",
    "observations were carried out in a mosaic of 2 ( 3 ) pointings at 5 ( 8)  ghz .",
    "data were edited and calibrated in the miriad package . in total intensity ( stokes  @xmath11 ) , mosaic images of the field were formed using uniform weighting and maximum entropy deconvolution .",
    "the resulting images were then corrected for both the mean primary beam response of the vla antennas and the mosaic pattern .",
    "the resolution and noise in the final images are given in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "images of the region were also formed in stokes  @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these images were made using natural weighting to give maximum sensitivity , and then deconvolved using a joint maximum entropy technique ( @xcite ) . at each of 5 and 8  ghz ,",
    "a linear polarization image @xmath15 was formed from @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "each @xmath15 image was clipped where the polarized emission or the total intensity was less than 5@xmath16 .    in order to determine a spectral index from these data , it is important to ensure that the images contain the same spatial scales .",
    "we thus spatially filtered each total intensity image ( see @xcite ) , removing structure on scales larger than @xmath17 and smoothing each image to a resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "the spatial distribution of spectral index was then determined using the method of `` t  t '' ( temperature - temperature ) plots ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "total intensity images of the region are shown in figure  [ fig_snr ] . at both 5 and 8  ghz ,",
    "a distinct shell of emission is seen , which we designate ; observed properties are given in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "the shell is clumpy , with a particularly bright clump on its eastern edge . in the east",
    "the shell is quite thick ( up to 50% of the radius ) , while the north - western rim is brighter and narrower .",
    "two point sources can be seen within the shell interior . at 5  ghz",
    ", the shell appears to be sitting upon a plateau of diffuse extended emission ; this emission is resolved out at 8  ghz .",
    "significant linear polarization at 5  ghz is seen from much of the shell , particularly in the two brightest parts of the shell on the eastern and western edges . where detected , the fractional polarization is 220% . at 8  ghz",
    ", linear polarization is seen only from these two regions , with fractional polarization 540% .",
    "no emission was detected in stokes @xmath14 , except for instrumental effects associated with the offset of the vla primary beam between left- and right - circular polarization .",
    "meaningful t ",
    "t plots were obtained for three regions of the snr , as marked in figure  [ fig_snr ] ; the spectral index , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , for each region is marked .",
    "there appear to be distinct variations in spectral index around the shell , but all three determinations fall in the range @xmath21 .",
    "two point sources are visible within the field . the more northerly of the two is at @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( j2000 ) , with @xmath24  mjy and @xmath25 , while the other is at @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( j2000 ) with @xmath28  mjy and @xmath29 .",
    "positional uncertainties for both sources are @xmath30 in each coordinate .",
    "no emission is detected from either source in stokes @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the source  is significantly linearly polarized and has a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the source has a distinct shell morphology , and shows no significant counterpart in 60 @xmath31 m _ iras _  data .",
    "these are all the characteristic properties of supernova remnants ( e.g. @xcite ) , and we thus classify  as a previously unidentified snr .      distances to snrs are notoriously difficult to determine .",
    "the purported @xmath32 relation has extremely large uncertainties , and this source is most likely too faint to show  absorption .",
    "so while we can not determine a distance to  directly , we can attempt to estimate its distance by associating it with other objects in the region .",
    "indeed hydrogen recombination lines from extended thermal material have been detected from the direction of  ( @xcite ) , at systemic velocities of @xmath33 and @xmath34  . adopting a standard model for galactic rotation ( @xcite ) ,",
    "these velocities correspond to possible distances of 3 , 6 , 9 or 12  kpc , a result which is not particularly constraining .    nevertheless ,  is of sufficiently small angular size that we can put an upper limit on its age simply by assuming that it is located within the galaxy . at a maximum distance of 20",
    "kpc , the snr is @xmath35  pc across . for a uniform ambient medium of density @xmath36  @xmath37 ,",
    "the snr has then swept up @xmath38  @xmath39 from the ism which , for typical ejected masses and ambient densities , corresponds to a snr which has almost completed the transition from free expansion to the adiabatic ( sedov - taylor ) phase ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "thus expansion in the adiabatic phase acts as an upper limit , and we can derive a maximum age for  of @xmath40  kyr , where @xmath41 is the kinetic energy of the explosion in units of @xmath42  erg . for a typical value @xmath43 ( @xcite ) , we find that the age of the snr must be less than 8  kyr . for distances nearer than 20  kpc",
    ", the snr is even younger .",
    "for example , at a distance of 10  kpc , the snr has swept up sufficiently little material from the ism that it is still freely expanding , and an expansion velocity 5000  then corresponds to an age 1.4  kyr .      is a young snr in the vicinity of a slow x - ray pulsar . if the two can be shown to be associated , and if we assume that  was born spinning rapidly , then the youth of the system argues that has slowed down to its current period via electromagnetic braking rather than accretion torque , and that it is thus best interpreted as a magnetar ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed",
    "if one assumes that the source has slowed down through the former process , its inferred dipole magnetic field is @xmath44  g , for an age @xmath45  kyr . for ages in the range 1.48  kyr (  [ sec_age ] above ) , this results in a field in the range @xmath46  g , typical of other sources claimed to be magnetars .    but",
    "are the two sources associated ? associations between neutron stars and snrs are judged on various criteria , including agreements in distance and in age , positional coincidence , and evidence for interaction .",
    "age and distance are the most fundamental of these , but unfortunately existing data on  provide no constraints on an age , and suggest only a very approximate distance of @xmath310  kpc ( gv98 ; t98 ) .    the source 2  ( @xcite )",
    "is located well within the confines of , less than @xmath47 from the center of the remnant ( see figure  [ fig_snr ] ) .",
    "vasisht et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue that  and 2  are the same source ; if we assume that this source is associated with the snr and was born at the remnant s center , then we can infer an upper limit on its transverse velocity of @xmath48  , where the distance to the system is @xmath49  kpc . in  [ sec_age ] we estimated @xmath50 , and so the velocity inferred falls comfortably within the range seen for the radio pulsar population ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) alternatively , if we assume a transverse velocity of @xmath51  , we can infer an age for the system of @xmath52  kyr , consistent with the determinations above .",
    "there is no obvious radio counterpart to the x - ray pulsar  both radio point sources in the region are outside all of the x - ray error circles . at the position of 2 , we set a 5@xmath16 upper limit of 1  mjy on the 5  ghz flux density of any point source .",
    "we also need to consider the possibility that the positional alignment of 2  and  is simply by chance .",
    "the region is a complex part of the galactic plane  there are 15 catalogued snrs within 5 and it seems reasonable in such a region that unassociated snrs and neutron stars could lie along the same line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "many young radio pulsars have no associated snr ( @xcite ) , so there is no reason to demand that even a young neutron star be associated with a snr .",
    "the first quadrant of the galaxy is not well - surveyed for snrs , so we estimate the likelihood of a chance association by considering the fourth quadrant , which has been thoroughly surveyed for snrs by whiteoak & green ( 1996 ) . in a representative region of the sky defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we find 44 snrs in their catalogue .",
    "thus for the @xmath310 radio - quiet neutron stars , axps and sgrs at comparable longitudes and latitudes , there is a probability @xmath55 that at least one will lie within @xmath47 of the center of a known snr by chance .",
    "of course in the present case we have carried out a targeted search towards a given position , and so the probability of spatial coincidence is somewhat higher than for a survey ; nevertheless , we regard it unlikely that 2  should lie so close to the center of an unrelated snr , and hence propose that the pulsar and the snr are genuinely associated .",
    "there is good evidence that magnetars power radio synchrotron nebulae through the injection of relativistic particles into their environment ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two such sources known are filled - center nebulae with spectral indices @xmath56 , and in one case the neutron star is substantially offset from the core of its associated nebula ( @xcite ) . in figure  [ fig_snr ] , the clump of emission with peak at @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( j2000 ) has such properties , and one can speculate that it corresponds to such a source .",
    "alternatively , compact steep - spectrum features are seen in other shell snrs , and may be indicative of deceleration of the shock in regions where it is expanding into a dense ambient medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "radio observations of the field of the slow x - ray pulsar  reveal a linearly polarized non - thermal shell , , which we classify as a previously undiscovered supernova remnant .",
    "we infer that  is young , with an upper limit on its age of 8000  yr .",
    "the proposed quiescent counterpart of , 2 , is almost at the center of , from which we argue that the pulsar and snr were created in the same supernova explosion .",
    "the young age of the system provides further evidence that anomalous x - ray pulsars are isolated magnetars rather than accreting systems , although we caution that the apparent flux variability of  raises questions over both its classification as an axp and its positional coincidence with .",
    "future x - ray measurements should be able to clarify the situation .",
    "there are now six known axps , three of which have been associated with snrs . in every case the pulsar is at or near the geometric center of its snr .",
    "this result is certainly consistent with axps being young , isolated neutron stars , as argued by the magnetar hypothesis . if one considers the radio pulsar population , the fraction of pulsars younger than a given age which can be convincingly associated with snrs drops as the age threshold increases .",
    "the age below which 50% of pulsars have good snr associations is @xmath320  kyr , and for several of these the pulsar is significantly offset from the center of its snr ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus if the snrs associated with both axps and radio pulsars come from similar explosions and evolve into similar environments , this seems good evidence that axps are considerably younger than 20  kyr .",
    "indeed all of the three snrs associated with axps have ages @xmath5910  kyr ( @xcite ; @xcite ;  [ sec_age ] of this paper ) . while the sample of axps is no doubt incomplete , this implies a galactic birth - rate for axps of @xmath600.6 kyr@xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath62% of core - collapse supernovae ( @xcite ) , or 3%20% of the radio pulsar population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is mounting evidence that soft @xmath4-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are also magnetars ( @xcite ) .",
    "however of the four known sgrs , two ( 052666 and 162741 ) are on the edge of young snrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a third ( 1900 + 14 ) is on the edge of an old snr ( @xcite ) , and the fourth ( 180620 ) has no associated snr blast wave ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that sgrs represent an older , or higher velocity , manifestation of magnetars than do axps .",
