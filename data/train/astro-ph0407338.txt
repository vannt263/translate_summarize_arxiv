    "bright x - ray emission from isolated late - type b - stars ( and early a - stars ) remains enigmatic , as conventional stellar theory predicts these stars neither to have the magnetically active coronae of cool stars nor to eject sufficiently intense stellar winds like those of hot o- and early b- stars .",
    "therefore , it was surprising that a deep _ rosat _",
    "survey detected as many as 86 late b - stars ( berghfer , schmitt , & cassinelli 1996 ) . in an effort to explain these results , @xcite searched for companions to the alleged x - ray - bright b - stars",
    ". a companion , it was presumed , could be the actual x - ray  source . in 24 cases out of a selected list of 49",
    "b - stars , evidence for an active late - type companion was _ not _ found , leaving the high level of x - ray  flux associated with these b - stars a mystery . until recently , the discussion in the community on whether b - stars are intrinsic x - ray  emitters or not has suffered from the limitations on our ability to resolve the b - stars from their putative low - mass companions .    the superb angular resolution available for imaging with the _ chandra _  x - ray  telescope has allowed @xcite to resolve a handful of b - stars , previously suspected as intrinsic x - ray  emitters , from the position of their associated x - ray  sources",
    "however , in some cases even the angular resolution of _ chandra _  is insufficient ( e.g. , hd  1685  a in @xcite ) and a different approach is required . we have constructed and proposed a series of x - ray  spectroscopic tests , which provide a scheme to determine whether the x - rays  emanate from the immediate vicinity of the b - star  or not .",
    "these methods are particularly useful in the cases where the source can not be angularly resolved by direct imaging .    some of the x - ray  brightest , presumably isolated , late - type b - stars are chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars , whose atmosphere is significantly enriched with peculiar elements . since highly - charged ions of any heavy element emit bright lines in the x - ray  band , the potential observation of peculiar elements in the x - ray  spectrum provides a powerful tool for testing whether or not the x - rays  are due to the b - star . with that in mind , we chose to observe @xmath0  lep , a late - type b9 , non - magnetic , cp hgmn b - star , also known as hr  1702 or hd  33904 , with the _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  grating spectrometers .",
    "as detected by _",
    "@xcite , @xmath0  lep  is the x - ray - brightest late - type hgmn b - star .",
    "most importantly , @xmath0  lep  was included in the survey of @xcite for which an x - ray  active companion was searched for , but not found .",
    "the target @xmath0  lep  was observed with _ xmm - newton _  on 2003 march  23 - 24 for 47  ks .",
    "all three epic  cameras were operated in full - frame mode with a thick filter and the two reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) were operational simultaneously .",
    "the epic  and rgs  data were processed with sas version 5.4.1 .",
    "standard event filtering procedures were followed including background subtraction using off - target ccd  regions .",
    "@xmath0  lep  was also observed with _",
    "chandra _  in the letgs- hrc - s  ( low energy transmission grating with the high resolution camera ) configuration on 2003 december  1 - 2 for 64  ks and on 2004 january  12 for 37  ks .",

    "the discrepancy of 0.93 is about a 3@xmath3 offset from the astrometric accuracy of hrc - s .",
    "this already hints to the x - ray  source not being associated with the b - star .",
    "nevertheless , we proceed with the spectroscopic diagnostics below .",
    "if indeed there is a secondary source separated by about 1  from @xmath0  lep , it has to be faint in the k  band as the separation achieved by @xcite was as low as 0.3 and increasingly sensitive for larger separations .",
    "alternatively , the separation may be variable . at @xmath0",
    "lep s distance of 56.5  pc , 0.93 corresponds to a projected distance of 52  au .",
    "the epic  mos1 and letgs - zero - order light curves are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the mos  light curve , two short duration flares ( @xmath4  10  ks ) are observed in which the peak flux is about 1.5 and 2.0 times what seems to be the average non - flare flux level .",
    "letgs  just catches a similar flare ( @xmath51.8 ) declining , with subsequent flux variations of as much as 40% thereafter .",
    "the variability is observed on time scales of a few hours .",
    "the letgs  spectrum is of insufficient quality due to the high background level of the hrc .",
    "we focus therefore on the rgsspectrum .",
    "rgs  1 and rgs  2 recorded 1400 and 1635 source counts , respectively .",
    "the total flux measured from 6 to 37  (0.34  - 2.1  kev ) is ( 1.15  @xmath6 0.03 ) @xmath5  10  @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "this can be compared with the flux of ( 2.4  @xmath6 0.23 ) @xmath5  10  @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath9  measured over the 0.1  - 2.0  kev band with _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is reasonable considering the slightly wider _ rosat _  band and the fact that the source flux varies typically by a factor of 2 . assuming the x - ray  source to be at the same distance as @xmath0  lep(56.5  pc )",
    ", the rgs  flux translates into an x - ray  luminosity in the rgs  band of @xmath10  = ( 4.4  @xmath6  0.1 )  @xmath5  10  @xmath11  erg  s@xmath8 .    the full rgs  spectrum is presented in fig .  2 along with a simple model that serves mainly to highlight the identified bright lines .",
    "the model is an ion - by - ion fit to the data similar to the method used in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum features many emission lines and little continuum .",
    "ly@xmath12 appears to be slightly ( red)shifted from its rest - frame position of 18.969   .",
    "it is measured with rgs1 at 18.988  @xmath6 0.007    and with rgs2 at 18.998",
    "@xmath6 0.006   , i.e. , redshifted by 300  @xmath6  110 and 460  @xmath6  90  km  s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "this could hint to rapid orbital motion of a late - type companion or to a wind .",
    "however , the positions of other bright lines are all formally consistent with the rest - frame wavelengths to within 200  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we prefer to interpret the ly@xmath12 anomaly as a calibration / statistics artifact .",
    "line widths are unresolved , providing only a not - very - constraining upper limit of @xmath13 500  km  s@xmath8  at 19    for the turbulent velocity width .",
    "the he - like triplets are vital to the determination of the distance of the x - ray  source from the b - star . in the presence of the high uv  flux of the b - star",
    ", intensity would be transferred from the forbidden line ( @xmath14 ) to the intercombination line ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the best measured he - like triplet in the rgsspectrum is that of .",
    "the unperturbed ( low - density , no - uv ) value of the @xmath16 intensity ratio is @xmath4 4.4 , which then decreases rapidly as the distance between the uv(b - star ) and x - ray  sources is reduced .",
    "the region of the spectrum containing the bright lines is shown in fig .",
    "although the moderate statistics hamper accurate determination of the line fluxes , the @xmath16 ratio is obviously high and a lower limit for this ratio can be readily obtained .",
    "the @xmath15 line ( @xmath17  = 21.801   ) can barely be identified in fig .",
    "3 . indeed , the best - fit @xmath15 line flux is nil with an error of 2.0  @xmath5  10@xmath18  ph  s@xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "the best - fit fluxes for the @xmath19 ( 21.602   ) and @xmath14 ( 22.097   ) lines are 10.5  @xmath5  10@xmath18 and 6.0  @xmath5  10@xmath18  ph  s@xmath8  @xmath9 , respectively , neither of which is tightly constrained . the upper limit of 2.0  @xmath5  10@xmath18  ph  s@xmath8  @xmath9  for the @xmath15 line flux yields a lower limit to the @xmath16 ratio of 3.0 , although a higher value ( @xmath20 4.0 ) is much more likely . the three - line model in fig .",
    "3 shows the best - fit fluxes for the @xmath19 and @xmath14 lines , but the above upper limit for the @xmath15 line flux .",
    "the implication of this measurement is demonstrated in fig .  4 where we show the theoretical @xmath16 ratio as a function of the distance of the x - ray  source from @xmath0  lep  assuming it is a perfect blackbody at @xmath21 12,400  k @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that even at the conservative limit of @xmath16  = 3.0 , the x - ray  source has to be at least 10.4 stellar radii ( @xmath22 ) away from the b - star .",
    "we take this as evidence for the x - rays  not originating from the b - staritself , but rather from a previously unresolved companion : @xmath0  lep - b . with surface gravity of @xmath23  = 3.7 ( cm  s@xmath24 )",
    "@xcite and a mass of 3.5  @xmath25 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 10.4  @xmath22 for @xmath0  lep  corresponds to @xmath26 0.2  au , which is much less than the estimate of @xmath4  50  au obtained in  2.1 .",
    "indeed , the separation is probably much larger than 10.4  @xmath22 , only that the moderate statistics of the spectrum call for caution .",
    "a similar result : @xmath27  3.0 is found using the triplet , where the @xmath14-line is even stronger relatively , only the blending of the @xmath15-line with lines makes the exact determination of the @xmath16 ratio more model dependent .",
    "another powerful diagnostic tool is the potential detection of emission lines of peculiar elements . as a hgmn star , the abundances of elements such as hg and",
    "mn are enriched in the atmosphere of @xmath0  lep  by a few orders of magnitude compared to solar composition .",
    "if the x - ray  source is on @xmath0  lep , we would naively expect to observe lines of these elements in the x - ray  spectrum .",
    "the strongest , isolated line expected is that of ne - like at 16.62   , which is the isoelectronic analog of the 15.01  resonant line of .",
    "no clear mn line is identified .",
    "nonetheless , an upper limit to the line flux and , thus , to the mn abundance can be obtained . an utterly prudent estimate ( essentially ascribing the noise in that range to the line ) gives an upper limit of 1.0  @xmath5  10@xmath28  ph  s@xmath8  @xmath9  for the line flux , while the flux of the fe line at 15.01    is 1.0  @xmath5  10@xmath18  ph  s@xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "owing to the comparable collisional excitation rates of the two lines ( that of mn is even 10% larger ) , this translates into a mn / fe abundance ratio of @xmath4  0.1 at the most ( again , probably much less ) , in stark contrast with the ratio of 1.5 observed on @xmath0  lep  @xcite .",
    "( the mn / fe solar value is 0.008 . )",
    "this constitutes more proof that the x - ray  source is not on @xmath0  lep .",
    "we note that strong emission by highly ionized hg is also expected at @xmath4  43  @xcite , which is just outside the rgs  range",
    ".    in short , there is accumulating spectroscopic evidence , namely the high @xmath16 ratios and the absence of peculiar elements , which demonstrates that the x - ray  source is not on @xmath0  lep , but rather at an appreciable distance from it .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray  source is not due to stellar winds from the b - star , nor to any other form of gas that has undergone chemical fractionation inside the b - staratmosphere .",
    "wind shocks are also ruled out by the short flares and by the observed high x - ray  temperatures ( see  3 ) .",
    "having established that the x - rays  are not coming from @xmath0  lep , the x - raysource companion @xmath0  lep - b  is of interest by its own merits .",
    "the goal of this section is to try and shed some light on the nature of @xmath0  lep - b  although the absence of optical or ir detections impedes conclusive results .",
    "hence , @xmath29 for @xmath0  lep - b  is unknown and since the x - ray  emission ( @xmath10 ) is not due to winds nor is it directly related to the b - star , @xmath30(b - star ) is not a meaningful parameter .",
    "thus , @xmath0  lep - b  may be a cool main sequence ( ms ) , or a pre - ms  ( pms ) companion .",
    "pms stars have been suggested as the x - raycompanions of b - stars , as the b - star  system is naturally young enough for a low - mass companion to be in its early evolutionary stages .",
    "assuming @xmath29  = 8.7@xmath510@xmath31  erg  s@xmath8  for @xmath0  lep@xcite , the tables of @xcite give an estimated age of 19  myr .",
    "ir detections provide evidence for pmscompanions to b - stars of similar ages @xcite .",
    "pms stars are usually also radio sources , but @xmath0  lep  has not been observed properly in the radio . the x - ray  emission mechanism in pms stars is thought to be magnetic @xcite , although shocks have also been suggested @xcite . either way , it is well established that pms stars are bright x - ray  sources .    for ms stars ,",
    "there is a strong correlation between x - ray emission and rotational velocity : @xmath32 = 10@xmath33  erg  s@xmath8@xcite .",
    "if @xmath0  lep  is a tidally locked binary , a plausible scenario which could explain the chemical peculiarity , its low rotational velocity : @xmath34 10  km  s@xmath8  @xcite would imply @xmath32 @xmath35  erg  s@xmath8  for a cool star companion .",
    "this is significantly lower than observed : @xmath10  = ( 4.4  @xmath6  0.1 )  @xmath5  10  @xmath11  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , pms stars have an opposite , although not as tight , correlation where x - ray  emission decreases with rotational velocity ( see fig .  7 in * ? ? ? * ) . estimating the rotational period of @xmath0  lep  to be 2@xmath36  22@xmath37 days , we find that the present @xmath32 value is consistent with the correlation of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we favor the identification of @xmath0  lep - b  as a pms star .",
    "the x - ray  luminosity and variability of @xmath0  lep - b  are also consistent with previous x - ray  observations of pms stars : the x - ray  luminosity is well within the pms  range of @xmath10  = 10  @xmath38 to 10  @xmath39  erg  s@xmath8  and the variability ( fig .",
    "1 ) is in line with the fact that x - ray  emission of pms stars is dominated by flares .",
    "if indeed @xmath0  lep - b  is a pms star , at 56.5  pc it is arguably the closest one to earth .",
    "the x - ray  thermal and chemical structure of @xmath0  lep - b  can be tested against general characteristics of pms stars .",
    "although we leave a more elaborate spectral analysis for future work , there are a few points that can already be made here .",
    "a range of temperatures is observed in the rgs  spectrum .",
    "high temperatures above 1  kev are observed through the well identified fe - l ions up to ( see fig .  2 ) and by mg , si , and s k - shell lines clearly detected with the epic  cameras ( not shown ) .",
    "conversely , the 2p3d lines of are identified at @xmath4  15.2    ( behar et  al . 2001 ) and are indicative of temperatures as low as @xmath40  = 0.2  kev .",
    "even lower temperatures may be probed after we do a careful job of identifying the l - shell lines of mid - z elements , e.g. , ca , ar , & s @xcite .",
    "higher temperatures : @xmath41  2  kev have been suggested in x - raymeasurements of pms stars @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence in our spectrum for such high temperatures .",
    "since two other state of the art grating observations of t tauri stars ( ttss ) @xcite do not show such high temperatures either , we suspect that temperatures as high as 2  kev may not be ubiquitous to pms stars .",
    "a robust method for distinguishing between accreting and non - accreting pms stars by means of x - ray  spectra alone has yet to be established . nonetheless , between the two well studied ttss :",
    "tw  hydrae ( accreting ) and hd  98800 ( non - accreting ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) , the present spectrum is more similar to that of hd  98800 .",
    "the emission measure distributions of both @xmath0  lep - b  and hd  98800 are broad , the latter covering the temperature range of 0.2   1.0  kev .",
    "the strong o & ne lines compared to those of fe in the present spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) also resemble the ratios observed in hd  98800 and are very different from the abundance anomaly found in tw  hya .",
    "finally , the high densities ( 10  @xmath42  @xmath43 ) observed for tw  hya through quenched forbidden lines are not observed for @xmath0  lep - b . in short ,",
    "@xmath0  lep - b  is probably a non - accreting magnetically - active pms star .",
    "using high - resolution grating spectroscopy , we have discovered the x - ray  source @xmath0  lep - b  to be distinct from the b - star  @xmath0  lep .",
    "this result is based on the x - ray  source being 0.93 from the nominal position of the b - star , but even more conclusively by two spectroscopic findings : 1 .",
    "the observed forbidden lines of the he - like triplets are unaffected by the b - star s uv  light and therefore can not originate from close to the b - star .",
    "2 . there is no significant evidence in the x - ray  spectrum for mn , which is known to be extremely abundant on @xmath0  lep .",
    "the methods used here are most general and could be used to test whether other cp b - stars are intrinsic x - ray  emitters , or not . the x - ray  luminosity and variability indicate that @xmath0  lep - b  could be a pms star , although it is impossible to totally rule out a faint , late type cool star . by comparison with grating observations of other pms stars ,",
    "we suspect the x - rayemission of @xmath0  lep - b  is magnetically driven .",
