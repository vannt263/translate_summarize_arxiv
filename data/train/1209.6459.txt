    "the reconstruction of the system from partial information is one of the outstanding and unresolved problems in the field of statistical physics of networks @xcite . indeed , there are several real - world economic and financial contexts where knowledge of the entire network structure would be crucial to assess the resilience of the system to both exogenous and endogenous shocks while , at the same time , only limited information on that structure is available .",
    "an example is the case of financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions and links represent financial ties of various types such as loans or derivative contracts .",
    "these ties result in many cases in dependencies among institutions and constitute the ground for the propagation of financial distress across the network .",
    "the resilience of the whole system to the default or the distress of one or more institutions depends on the topological structure of the network @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to confidentiality issues banks do not disclose their mutual exposures .    typically the analysis of systemic risk is done by reconstructing the network using the so - called maximum entropy ( me ) algorithm .",
    "this method assumes that the network is fully connected ( for this reason this class of approaches is called `` dense reconstruction methods '' ) .",
    "the weights of the links are then obtained via a `` maximum homogeneity '' principle .",
    "this means that each node is assumed to bear a similar level of dependence from all other nodes .",
    "the second step consists in finding a matrix that , while satisfying certain constraints ( imposed in this case by the budget of the individual banks ) , minimizes the distance from the uniform matrix in which each entry has the same value .",
    "such a matrix is found using the kullback - leibler divergence as the objective function to minimize @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis that the network is fully connected is a strong limitation of the me algorithm , since empirical networks are characterized by heterogeneous degree .",
    "moreover , @xcite has shown how the `` dense reconstruction '' leads to an underestimation of the systemic risk .",
    "they also provide a new algorithm that allows to minimize kullback - leibler divergence obtaining a matrix with an arbitrary level of heterogeneity under a maximum value depending on constraints .",
    "their algorithm provides a `` sparse reconstruction '' that is more reliable than the dense one .",
    "nevertheless it leaves open the question of what value of heterogeneity would be appropriate to choose , since the density of connections must be specified ex - ante and it is not recovered by the algorithm . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new general method , the bootstrapping method ( bm ) , to reconstruct the topology of the whole network starting from the knowledge of a subset of nodes .",
    "this method overcomes some of the limitations described above . to validate the method we use both synthetic networks as well as an example of real economic systems . in both cases",
    "we compare the reconstruction with the known total structure .",
    "this is the so - called world trade web ( wtw ) , i.e. the network of countries where links represent the financial flows corresponding to the trade volumes among them . in our method ,",
    "the allocation of the links among nodes is carried out using the fitness model@xcite . differently from other network generation models",
    ", the fitness model generates a network structure starting from a non - topological variables ( fitness ) associated to the nodes .",
    "this approach has been used in the past to reproduce the topological properties of several empirical economical networks , including the network of equity investments in the stock market @xcite , the interbank market @xcite , the currency market @xcite , and the wtw @xcite .",
    "we investigate how well it is possible to recover both the topological properties of the network and its resilience to distress propagation , as we vary the size of the subset of nodes for which information is available . among the topological properties , we focus on those that play an important role in contagion processes and in the propagation of distress , i.e. , the network density @xcite , the degree distribution @xcite , the k - core structure@xcite .",
    "we find that having information on a relatively small fraction of nodes is sufficient to recover with good approximation the above properties .",
    "for instance , with only about 7% of the nodes ( 10 out of 185 ) we have a relative error of about : 7% on the density , 10% on the average degree of the main core , 7% on the size of the main core . for the resilience , we focus on a recently introduced notion , debtrank @xcite , which measures the systemic impact of the initial distress of a subset of nodes , whenever the links in the network represent the dependencies among nodes . similarly to the above results , we find that with about 7% of the nodes the resilience is recovered with a relative error within 10% .    at a first thought , it can be surprising that a small fraction of nodes enables to reconstruct so well global emerging properties of the network .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that in the method , while the links are known only for a subset of nodes , the fitness is always known for all the nodes .",
    "thus , the method would probably require much higher fraction of nodes in order to reconstruct networks with special topologies such as strong community structure or networks where the fitness is not a strong factor in driving the connectivity .",
    "the investigation of these effects is left for future research .",
    "overall , our method can be applied in principle to any network representing a set of dependencies among components in a complex system and it is thus of general interest in the field of complex networks and statistical physics .",
    "in this paper we propose a bootstrap method ( bm ) to build the network using a fitness model .",
    "the method is described in section [ sec : bootstrapping - method ] . here",
    "we briefly describe the ergms and the associated fitness model . in order to generate ensembles of complex networks",
    "both dynamic and static approaches can be utilized . in the dynamic case ,",
    "nodes and/or links are added step by step using for instance a `` preferential attachment '' algorithm . in the static case , instead , the number of nodes is fixed the links are assigned at once according to some statistical or deterministic criterion .",
    "exponential random graph models ( ergm ) are one of the most studied class of network models@xcite .",
    "they can be described using the powerful mathematical formalism of the equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .    as a specific example",
    ", we will consider the so - called _ fitness _ or _ hidden variables _ models , where the network topology is determined by an intrinsic property ( called _ fitness _ ) associated with each node of the network@xcite . through this scheme we can define a framework to investigate those networks where the topology is driven , at least in part , by non - topological properties of the nodes . with the fitness model it is possible to study several economical networks , ranging from the wtw ( where the fitness of the model are the gdp of the various countries ) @xcite , to the financial networks ( where fitness are , for instance , the market capitalization of each institution ) @xcite",
    ".    given a set of network properties , @xmath0 the exponential random graph model ( ergm ) is defined as the ensemble @xmath1 of maximally random networks with @xmath0 constrained to some statistical properties . more specifically ,",
    "let us suppose that the ensemble averages of @xmath2 are fixed : @xmath3 it has been shown that @xmath1 can be defined through a set of control parameters @xmath4 , the values of which depend on a set of constraining values @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore the probability @xmath6 of a network @xmath7 to occur in @xmath1 is given by @xmath8 , where we introduced the graph hamiltonian @xmath9 , and the partition function @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath4 is the set of lagrange multipliers associated to the constraints @xmath5 .",
    "the fitness model can be seen as a specific case where the set of properties @xmath0 is the degree sequence @xmath11 of the nodes of the network . in this case",
    "@xmath12 , the partition function is exactly computable and each node can be identified by its control parameter ( or lagrange multiplier ) @xmath13 . fixing the values of @xmath14 is equivalent to fix the mean values of @xmath15 . in order to further clarify the role of @xmath14 in controlling the topology , let us define @xmath16 .",
    "it is possible to show that the ensemble is such that for each network in @xmath1 two nodes @xmath17 and @xmath18 are connected with a probability given by : @xmath19 therefore @xmath20 can be considered as the fitness of the node @xmath17 and it is related to the ability of @xmath17 to create links with other nodes .    the average in @xmath1 of several topological properties of the network can be expressed in terms of appropriate compositions of the linking probabilities @xmath21 for every @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "in this limit we can assume @xmath28 .",
    "the estimation of the linking probability @xmath21 between node @xmath17 and node @xmath18 , @xmath21 is the initial step in order to develop a network bootstrapping method .",
    "let us suppose to have incomplete information about the topology of a real network ( say @xmath29 ) . in particular , we assume to know the links of only a subset @xmath30 of the nodes .",
    "moreover , we assume to know , for all the nodes , a non - topological property , denoted as @xmath31 , that is correlated to some statistical properties of the degree @xmath22 of the nodes by a known relation as below clarified .",
    "for instance , in the world trade web @xmath31 could be the country gdp , while in financial networks it can be the operating revenue of the firm @xmath17 .",
    "we would like to estimate the value @xmath32 of a topological property @xmath33 of the network @xmath29 .",
    "we make two hypotheses :    1 .   the network @xmath29 has been drawn from an ensemble of ergm , that we call @xmath1 . from the statistical mechanics of networks we know that the value @xmath32 of the property @xmath34 in @xmath29 , varies within the range @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the standard deviation , and @xmath37 the average of the property @xmath34 estimated on the whole ensemble @xmath1 .",
    "each known value of the non - topological property @xmath31 is assumed to be proportional to the fitness , denoted as @xmath20 ( because a generic property of the network can be used as a fitness variable ) of the node @xmath17 in the ensemble @xmath1 , through a universal unknown parameter @xmath38 : @xmath39",
    ". therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob linking ] ) becomes : @xmath40    with these hypotheses , we map the problem of evaluating @xmath32 into the one of choosing an ergm ensemble @xmath1 compatible with the constraints given by the fitness . once @xmath1 is determined ( it is univocally defined by the set of @xmath41 ) , we can use the average @xmath42 as a good estimation for @xmath32 . within this framework ,",
    "the question is which ensemble @xmath1 , belonging to the class ergm , is the most probable to extract the real network @xmath29 , knowing only the partial information @xmath43 . since we know @xmath43 , i.e. the rescaled fitness values ( a non topological property of the network ) , the problem becomes to find the most likely value of @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason we use the notation @xmath44 for the desired ensemble .    notice that if we knew not only @xmath43 but the entire topology of the network , @xmath38 could be found by means of a maximum likelihood argument ( ref .",

    ". these values will be our benchmarks to test how good is the network reconstruction with the bm .",
    "we test the bm by using the following three topological quantities because they have been found to play a role in the distress propagation and contagion processes and therefore are relevant to the resilience of the network to systemic risk ( see section [ intro ] ) :    1 .",

    "the reconstruction of the debtrank values is already good for small subsets of nodes in the network .",
    "* using a gravity model ( even if simplified ) improves the estimate of the gdr of the wtw network * the gap between the homogeneous gdr and the empirical one increases for larger values of the impact rescaling factor @xmath92 .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows : when the network effects are important the use of homogeneous weights in the dynamics leads to a larger error .",
    "conversely when the network effects ( reverberation ) are less important the homogeneous weights are not so far from the _ true _ value of the gdr .    from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that the bm is good in reconstructing a non topological property such as the debtrank but to achieve this goal one has to chose careful the weights of links because the use of an average value leads to inaccurate estimates , especially if the network effects are relevant .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a new method to reconstruct the topology of a network using only partial information from its connections and an auxiliary non - topological property : the fitness associated to each node .",
    "this method is particularly useful to overcome the lack of topological information for several financial networks whose systemic risk must be measured .",
    "our approach allows to reconstruct the network using the topological information from one fraction of the nodes ( i.e. their links ) and a non topological property of each node derived from a fitness model .",
    "we tested the network bootstrap method ( bm ) on the world trade web network , where we can use an accurate fitness model to describe its topology starting from the a non topological property ( the gdp of the countries ) .",
    "we studied how well are reconstructed the following topological properties : the average density , the size , and the average degree of the main core .",
    "all these measures are related to systemic risk for financial networks as briefly presented in the introduction of this paper .",
    "we found that the density of the links , the size of the main core , the average degree of the main core are reconstructed with an error varying from 1% to 10% , depending from the property examined , using with 5% of the nodes ( 10 over the 185 nodes of the wtw network ) .",
    "an interesting finding is that the denser is a network the better is the reconstruction .",
    "the goodness of the reconstruction increases with the number of the nodes used as initial information and it is strongly dependent by the accuracy of the fitness model ( that for the wtw is an accurate model describing how the links form across countries depending on their gdp and geographical distance ) .",
    "the bm method was checked with another non topological property : the debtrank a novel measure of systemic risk .",
    "we discovered that the method was really effective in evaluating this property also with a small number of starting nodes .",
    "we carried out a test using link weights derived from the gravity model of the wtw ( the weight of a link is proportional to the product of the gdps of each node ) or using homogeneous ( averaged ) weights .    in the case of homogeneous weights",
    "the bm estimates a value of group debt rank ( a measure of the debtrank in a set of nodes ) that is lower than the real one .",
    "this means that when the network is simulated using an average value for the weight there is a systematic bias in the evaluation of systemic risk measures such as the debtrank .",
    "conversely , in the case of non homogeneous weights , imposing more realistic values from the wtw fitness ( gravity ) model we obtain a more accurate estimation of the group debt rank .",
    "this result stresses the importance , in the study of network systemic risk , to use a correct estimation of the weights and of the topological properties .",
    "finally we notice that the bigger is the impact factor @xmath92 in rescaling the nodes the greater is the distress propagation in the network captured by the group debt rank .",
    "we highlight that , for systemic risk , the network effects are responsible of an amplification of the distress .",
    "in fact the losses in the system due to a node failure ( a default or a partial impossibility to pay ) are bigger than the size of a country in terms of its ratio of gpd over the total market . in the paper we showed that countries that are not so big for gdp can have a significant impact on the wtw network depending on the size of their connections with others .    for what concerns possible future development",
    ", our work opens several challenges . to start with",
    ", we plan to test bm on other socio - economical networks , mainly financial ones .",
    "as written above , bm precision depends on how well fitness model describes real network . with wtw",
    "the fitness model works surprisingly well and it reproduces topological properties of any order @xcite .",
