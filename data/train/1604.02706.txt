    "due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications , sensitive information can be exposed to unintended receivers . a recent effort in order to protect the information in the physical layer has been carried out by relying on the information - theoretic concept introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this type of coding helps achieving a specific rate , known as the secrecy rate , with which the transmission is completely secure .",
    "secrecy rate was later extended to broadcast  @xcite , gaussian  @xcite , and fading channels  @xcite .",
    "one drawback is that to calculate the secrecy rate , channel state information ( csi ) of the eavesdropper is required , which is difficult to get in practice , specially for a passive eavesdropper .",
    "we further note that many communication systems use finite - alphabet signals ; in particular , @xmath0-psk modulation has various applications in wireless networks  @xcite , zigbee protocol  @xcite and multi - user communications  @xcite .",
    "since finite - alphabet signals usually have a non - gaussian distribution  @xcite , they are not optimal in terms of the developed secrecy rates in  @xcite",
    ". there has been research interest on the security improvement when finite - alphabet signals are used .",
    "the authors in  @xcite devote some of the available power to add a randomly scaled version of the finite - alphabet signal to the signal itself without optimal beamforming . if the added random part rotates the @xmath0-psk constellation enough",
    ", the eavesdropper detects the wrong symbol . in  @xcite",
    ", suboptimal random beamforming is used to enhance the security without requiring the eavesdropper csi when finite - alphabet signal is used .",
    "an external helper generating interference in the form of fine - alphabet signal is considered in  @xcite .",
    "information - theoretic secrecy rate expressions are derived by approximating the helping interference distribution as sum of the gaussian distributions and assuming the availability of the eavesdropper s csi .",
    "the authors in  @xcite study the information - theoretic secrecy rate for finite - alphabet signals in a communication system with multi - antenna nodes by assuming the eavesdropper csi availability at the transmitter . in another paradigm in  @xcite , random and optimized antenna subset selection from a large uniform linear antenna array system without optimal beamforming",
    "is employed in order to improve the security in a milliliter - wave system with line - of - sight channel .    in this work , rather than relying on the information - theoretic security concept of  @xcite , a signal processing approach based on the array - based directional modulation  @xcite concept is utilized in order to enhance the security , without requiring the eavesdropper s csi , when @xmath0-psk modulation is used for communication . in this technique , instead of producing the symbols at the transmitter ,",
    "the phase and amplitude of each element of the array is adjusted so that the resulting phase of the received signals on each antenna of the receiver is equal to the phase of a specific @xmath0-psk symbol .",
    "we assume the eavesdropper channel is independent from the one of the legitimate receiver .",
    "therefore , the received signals by the eavesdropper have a different resulting phase compared to the legitimate receiver .",
    "as shall be shown later , this increases the symbol error rate ( ser ) at the eavesdropper considerably .",
    "the summarized contributions are as follows .",
    "the optimal beamformer for a multi - antenna transmitter is designed when directional modulation is used for @xmath0-psk transmission .",
    "there are several works such as  @xcite which perform secrecy rate analysis by assuming the availability of the eavesdropper s csi , which is difficult to acquire in practice .",
    "however , in the directional modulation , the security is enhanced without requiring the eavesdropper csi while assuming that the eavesdropper is aware of the global csi as well as the transmitter and receiver configurations , including the number of antennas and the modulation order .",
    "although the information - theoretic secrecy rate provides perfect secrecy , i.e. , zero bit leakage , it reduces the message transmission rate . here",
    ", we rely on a signal processing - based approach , so the transmission rate does not need to be scarified in order to enhance the security .",
    "finally , the transmission channel csi is not required at the legitimate receiver when using the directional modulation , in addition , there is no need for zero - forcing ( zf ) or minimum - mean - square - error ( mmse ) multi - input and multi - output ( mimo ) receiver implementation at the legitimate receiver side .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sys : mod ] , the network configuration as well as the signal models are introduced .",
    "the security and the beamformer design for the directional modulation is mentioned in section  [ sec : phy : sec ] . in section  [ sec : sim ] , the security of the directional modulation is evaluated using simulations .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : con ] .",

    "all the communication channels are considered to be quasi - static block fading . after applying the optimal coefficients to array elements ,",

    "in this section , first , the security benefits of the directional modulation is discussed , and then the optimal beamformer design problem is formulated and solved .",
    "as indicated earlier , the design of the beamformer in the directional modulation scheme is based on the phase of the symbols which are to be conveyed to @xmath15 ; in particular , to recover the symbols , it is necessary for @xmath16 to somehow estimate @xmath35 . to this end , considering that @xmath16 is aware of @xmath27 , @xmath16 should begin by estimating @xmath32 given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the estimation of @xmath32 at @xmath16 . note that @xmath16 can compute   only in the case @xmath38 since @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the estimation of @xmath35 at @xmath16",
    ". however , the first step of estimating @xmath35 in   results in the noise enhancement at @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ser at @xmath16 will be higher than that of @xmath15 , especially in a low signal - to - noise ratio regime due to the fact that @xmath15 can directly detect the @xmath0-psk symbols without channel equalization . moreover , in the case of @xmath40",
    ", @xmath16 can not estimate @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 can not correctly decode the transmitted signal , and any attempt to do so leads to a high ser .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the condition @xmath40 is easily met in a massive mimo scenario , hence , the directional modulation technique appears to be a good candidate for security enhancement in massive mimo systems .",
    "@xmath44    in the next section , the optimal beamformer design problem for the directional modulation is formulated and solved from a power efficiency viewpoint .      in this section ,",
    "the optimal beamformer design problem for the directional modulation is defined and transformed into a linearly constrained quadratic program which can be solved efficiently .",
    "herein , the beamformer for the directional modulation will be designed to minimize the consumed power at the transmitter such that 1 ) the resulting phase of the signals received by each antenna of @xmath15 is equal to the phase of a specific @xmath0-psk symbol , and that 2 ) the required signal level for the in - phase and quadrature - phase components of the resulting @xmath0-psk symbol on each antenna of @xmath15 is preserved above a specific level .",
    "note that in such a setup , by minimizing the power we actually increase the ser at @xmath16 even when @xmath38 while keeping the quality of our own signal reception at the desired level .",
    "using the directional modulation signal model described in section  [ sec : sys : mod ] , the related beamformer design problem can be cast as    @xmath45    [ eqn : opt : dm ]    where @xmath46 is the @xmath47-th @xmath0-psk symbol possessing instantaneous unit energy , i.e. , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a scalar to adjust the required level for the in - phase and quadrature - phase components of the received signal at the corresponding antenna of @xmath15 .",
    "note that since the in - phase or quadrant - phase part of the symbol may be negative , both sides of the constraints   and   are multiplied by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "since   holds at the optimal point , @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same sign as @xmath52 and @xmath53 at the optimal point . as a result ,",
    "the multiplication at both sides of   and   does not change the side of the inequality .    to simplify  ,",
    "let s write the constraint   as @xmath54 where @xmath55 . using the equations derived in   and by putting together the constraints   and  , it is possible to reformulate   into a compact form as    @xmath56    [ eqn : opt : dm : sim ]    where @xmath57 , @xmath58^t}$ ] is the vector bearing the @xmath0-psk symbols , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "note that applying @xmath62 on the phases of the intended symbols causes ambiguity since symbols with different phases can have the same @xmath63 value , e.g. , @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the constraints @xmath65 and @xmath66 need to be added to the design problem   to resolve the phase ambiguity .",
    "interestingly , these constraints are already present in   and  .    to transform   into a familiar form , we represent @xmath67 and @xmath68 in order to write @xmath33 as @xmath69 ,   \\label{eqn : hw }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which helps us to write the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 as @xmath70 where @xmath71^t}$ ] , @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "also , it is straightforward to see that @xmath74 .    using the derivations in  ,   can be reformulated as @xmath75 for   to be feasible , @xmath76 should lie in the null space of the matrix @xmath77 . if the singular value decomposition of @xmath77 is shown by @xmath78 , the orthonormal basis for the null space of @xmath77 are the last @xmath79 columns of @xmath80 which span @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "this means that the vector @xmath76 can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "therefore ,   boils down into @xmath84 which is a convex linearly constrained quadratic programming and can be solved efficiently using standard convex optimization techniques .    since @xmath76 in",
    "is spanned by the last @xmath79 vectors of the matrix @xmath80 , a necessary condition for the existence of the optimal beamformer for the directional modulation is @xmath85 which means that the number of transmit antennas needs to be more than half of the number of antennas at the legitimate receiver .",
    "provided that the latter condition is met , a sufficient condition can be proposed from a geometrical point of view ; namely that the feasible set of   is not empty if and only if the intersection of the linear spaces in the constraint set constitutes a non - empty set . @xmath44",
    "in this section , the performance of the secure directional modulation and a benchmark scheme are demonstrated and compared using different simulation scenarios . in all simulations ,",
    "channels are considered to be quasi static block rayleigh fading which are generated using i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random variables with distribution@xmath86 and remain fixed during the interval in which the @xmath0-psk symbol is being conveyed to @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , the noise is also generated using i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random variables , and the modulation order used in all of the scenarios is @xmath87-psk . the acronym `` dm '' is used instead of the term `` directional modulation '' in the legend of the figures . before proceeding ,",
    "we first mention the benchmark scheme .    ,",
    "@xmath88 , and @xmath89.,width=283 ]    the zf at the transmitter in order to neutralize the interference between received symbol streams at @xmath15  @xcite is used as the comparison benchmark .",
    "in contrast to the directional modulation scheme , the symbols in the benchmark scheme are generated and sent from the transmitter .",
    "the received signals at @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the amplification factor for the symbols which acts similar as @xmath49 in the directional modulation scheme .",
    "after the signal is received by @xmath16 , it estimates the transmitted symbols as @xmath93^ { - 1}}{\\left ( { { { \\bf{h}}_e}{\\bf{p } } } \\right)^h}{{\\bf{y}}_e } \\nonumber\\\\ & = { \\bf{s } } + { \\left [ { { { \\left ( { { { \\bf{h}}_e}{\\bf{p } } } \\right)}^h}{{\\bf{h}}_e}{\\bf{p } } } \\right]^ { - 1}}{\\left ( { { { \\bf{h}}_e}{\\bf{p } } } \\right)^h}{{\\bf{n}}_e}. \\label{eqn : eve : rec : sig : zf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dimension of the matrix @xmath94 is @xmath95 which results in @xmath96^ { - 1}}{\\left ( { { { \\bf{h}}_e}{\\bf{p } } } \\right)^h}{{\\bf{h}}_e}{\\bf{p}}=\\bf{i}$ ] for @xmath97 .",
    "this means that @xmath16 can recover the symbols even with the condition @xmath40 .",
    "generally , satisfying the condition @xmath40 is easier than @xmath98 since the base station has usually more antennas than the users .",
    "considering that the condition for @xmath16 to estimate @xmath35 and detect the @xmath0-psk symbol in the directional modulation scheme is @xmath99 , the directional modulation is much more probable to enhance the security compared to the benchmark scheme .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the effect of the number of transmission antennas , @xmath100 , on the consumed power is investigated .",
    "the average consumed power with respect to @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pow : ant ] .",
    "as seen , for a specific range of @xmath100 , the directional modulation consumes less power than the benchmark scheme .",
    "furthermore , the difference in power consumption increases when the number of antennas at @xmath15 increases .",
    "the ser at @xmath15 and @xmath16 when using different number of transmitting antennas is studied in the second scenario .",
    "the average ser with respect to @xmath100 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ser : ant ] .",
    "as it is seen , the directional modulation causes considerably more ser at @xmath16 compared to the benchmark scheme .",
    "furthermore , as the antennas of @xmath16 increase , the difference between the ser caused at @xmath16 by the directional modulation and benchmark scheme increases for specific values of @xmath100 .",
    "for example , when @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the difference between the ser caused by the directional modulation and zf schemes is more than the case when @xmath101 and @xmath103 .    , @xmath88 , and @xmath89.,width=283 ]     and @xmath103.,width=283 ]    in the last scenario ,",
    "the relation between the required level , @xmath49 , for the in - phase and quadrature - phase components of the induced symbols at @xmath15 and the ser at @xmath15 and @xmath16 is studied .",
    "the average ser at @xmath15 and @xmath16 with respect to @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ser : snr ] . as it is observed , when using the benchmark scheme , the ser at @xmath16 decreases as @xmath49 increases .",
    "this reduction is more when the antennas of @xmath15 decreases .",
    "on the other hand , when using the directional modulation scheme , the ser at @xmath16 does not decrease as the required signal level at the legitimate increases .",
    "as mentioned , this is due to the fact that for @xmath97 , @xmath16 can remove the effect of precoder in the benchmark scheme and decrease its own ser .",
    "however , as explained in section  [ subsec : sec : adv ] , @xmath16 can not estimate @xmath35 when @xmath40 in the directional modulation . therefore , assuming the independence of @xmath27 and @xmath30 , @xmath16 has to detect the symbols according to the phases of the vector @xmath104 which are different from the phases of the vector @xmath35 .",
    "the optimal beamformer for the secure directional modulation was designed without requiring the eavesdropper s csi .",
    "it was seen that the eavesdropper can not regenerate the beamformer and has to estimate the signal received by the legitimate receiver using the global csi knowledge .",
    "however , this estimation enhances the noise and is only possible when the transmitter has less antennas than the eavesdropper .",
    "the directional modulation was compared with the zf at the transmitter as the benchmark . in the zf scheme ,",
    "the eavesdropper had to have more antennas than the legitimate receiver to recover the symbol .",
    "the results showed that directional modulation leads into less power consumption and more ser at the eavesdropper compared to the conventional benchmark scheme .",
    "these observations confirm the reliability of the studied directional modulation approach from a security point of view .                  ``",
