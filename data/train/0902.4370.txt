    "high purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors are used for @xmath2-ray detection and spectroscopy in nuclear physics experiments , including low radioactive background detector systems , such as the proposed majorana experiment  @xcite .",
    "others have shown and explained how a detected spectrum shape can vary noticeably based on the position of a @xmath2-emitting radiation source relative to the detector  @xcite .",
    "we show that the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test is sensitive to these changes as well .",
    "we also show that the radial position of nearby @xmath2-emitting radiation sources can be accurately reconstructed using the k - s test to compare spectra taken at different locations .",

    "we obtained the @xmath2-ray energy spectra of a @xmath0co point source at different positions around the detector . a flat piece of acrylic was taped to the detector cryostat can to hold the source at a set location .",
    "we moved the source along a grid with a 2  mm spacing that was marked on the acrylic sheet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detectordiagram ] .",
    "the source was started 5  mm from the detector endcap , and data points were taken until the source was approximately 35  mm away from the detector . each data point was taken for 45  seconds , which yielded an average of 80  000 counts per spectrum .",
    "we also varied the exposure time in 5-second intervals from 5 to 45  seconds for a location 5  mm from the outer casing of the detector .",
    "this data was used to quantify statistical effects on the determination of the position of the @xmath0co source .",

    "specifically , it applied a well - known goodness - of - fit test , the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , between a test spectrum and all the reference spectra .",
    "the k - s test finds the maximum distance between two cumulative distribution functions , in our case the cumulants of the energy spectra .",
    "this maximum distance is inversely correlated to the likelihood that the two distributions came from the same distribution , and is converted into a probability using the kolmogorov distribution  @xcite .",
    "this version of the k - s test is ideally used on unbinned data , but with binned data the output of the test is still a reliable measure of how similar the two distributions are if the bin - size is smaller than the energy resolution , as is the case here .",
    "we chose the k - s test as it is sensitive to subtle differences in the shape of spectra , conceptually simple , and computationally fast .",
    "we found that the logarithm of the k - s test value was a better indicator than the actual value of how correlated two spectra were .",
    "typical cumulative distribution functions used in the study are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf ] .",
    "interestingly , these results indicate that the middle of the compton continuum provides the k - s test with the most sensitivity to position - dependent differences in the spectral - shapes .",
    "it is less sensitive to the peak - to - compton ratio , for example .",
    "this may also be a manifestation of the k - s test s propensity to be less sensitive to the tails of distributions .",
    "regardless , it still indicates that there is position - sensitive information contained in the spectral shape of the low - energy half of the compton continuum .",
    "a monte carlo simulation in geant4 @xcite was used to simulate this experiment as well .",
    "the simulation geometries were created to match the actual experiment as closely as possible , and @xmath0co and @xmath1cs sources were simulated around the hpge detector at the same locations the @xmath0co radiation source was measured around the physical detector .",

    "we performed a quick analysis to verify our analysis against earlier work concerning the peak - to - compton ratio .",
    "[ fig : areachange ] shows the change in the 1.33  mev peak area and the sum peak area relative to the total area as a function of position around the detector for physical @xmath0co measurements . obviously , there is little variation in the relative 1.33  mev peak area , but a clear trend is seen with the sum peak . when the radiation source was placed at the center of the front of the detector and halfway down the side of the detector , the relative sum peak area was roughly five times greater than when the radiation source was placed behind the detector .",
    "this is due to the fact that the solid angle subtended by the detector is greatest at the center of the front of the detector and the center of the side , as previously described in  @xcite .",
    "this difference was clearly visible without conducting statistical tests .",
    "the 1.17  mev peak area differed with roughly the same distribution as the 1.33  mev peak , with a difference in amplitude because the two peaks depend on the solid angle subtended by the detector in the same manner  @xcite .",
