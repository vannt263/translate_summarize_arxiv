    "the s0s with polar rings ( @xcite ) are galaxies whose peculiarities have been originated by the accretion of matter from outside .",
    "they show a luminous ring , composed of gas , dust and stars , encircling the stellar body in polar orbits .",
    "the ring may exhibit a knotty appearance and blue colors ( e.g. ngc 4650a ) or a smooth aspect and red colors ( e.g. ugc 7576 ) .",
    "the latest and widest compilation of cases of polar ring galaxies has been made by whitmore  ( 1990 ) . in this catalogue ( here and after called prc ) they discuss the origin of such structures , estimating that about the 5% of all s0 galaxies has had a polar ring in the past , or has one now .",
    "the external origin of the ring is explained by the fact that there is no natural way for internal gas to set into a polar orbit and that the large quantities of hi detected ( @xmath1 ) are very unusual for early - type galaxies .",
    "the origin and stability of polar ring galaxies are still a matter of discussion .",
    "the current hypotheses foresee an origin linked to an environment which should be different from that of normal galaxies .",
    "the s0s could have `` cannibalized '' a gas - rich companion ( @xcite , @xcite ) or could have accreted cold gas on polar orbits from a massive disk galaxy , through a mass transfer during a close encounter ( @xcite ) .",
    "both these mechanisms are more frequent in an environment rich in satellites or in nearby galaxies .",
    "the pr may alternatively have accreted surrounding primeval gas , possibly from a gas cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stability of polar rings also shows different scenarios , as the present theories furnish different evolutionary times : some gas - dynamics simulations have calculated quite a fast evolution of the order of 10@xmath2 yr ( @xcite ) , while some n - body models foresee long formation time - scales and slow evolution ( @xcite ) or even dynamical equilibrium ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the first cases the rings now observed",
    "must be all young , unstable structures ; on the contrary if the evolutionary time scale is large or the ring is in equilibrium , most rings , or even all of them , may be old structures .",
    "we present here a study oriented to point out the differences , if any , between the environment of prs with respect to normal galaxies , in order to discriminate among the above different hypotheses .",
    "we engaged two kinds of approach : i ) a statistical analysis of the objects detected in the sky region surrounding the polar ring ; ii ) a survey of the galaxies with similar magnitude and red - shift as the central object ( pr or normal galaxy ) in a wider region of sky .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , > , > ,",
    "< , > , > \" , ]     if the accreted matter derives from a close encounter with a massive galaxy , this galaxy may be present in the same sky region at a distance higher than 5 pr - diameters and may have a red - shift similar to that of the pr .",
    "its identification is the subject of our second analysis .",
    "we are obliged again to divide the sample into two sets : a ) 31 prs with known distance from red - shift , for which it is possible to define a search volume ; b ) 25 remaining prs lacking redshift , or possessing nearby bright objects whose redshift is unknown .",
    "the search has been performed on leda database and the results are listed in table [ companions ] .",
    "a control sample of normal galaxies with known red - shift was also selected .",
    "the number of objects found around every galaxy of this latter sample was then compared with that counted for the prs ( column nc of the table [ companions ] ) .",
    "when both the linear separation @xmath3 and the redshift of the companions are known , the search area can be defined as the space that a companion galaxy spans in a @xmath4 time , traveling with a relative @xmath5 radial velocity .",
    "the maximum projected search radius around the pr is then @xmath6 we chose @xmath7 , adopting km / s for the velocity and gyr for the time .",
    "@xmath8 represents the maximum distance covered in 1 gyr by a galaxy moving at 600 km / s or at a slower velocity with respect to the pr . inside @xmath8 , we selected all the galaxies with magnitudes or redshifts similar to that of the central pr . for each of them",
    ", we computed , with respect to the pr , the velocity difference @xmath5 in km / s , the linear separation @xmath9 in mpc and the minimum crossing time @xmath4 .",
    "the definition of these parameters is as following : @xmath10 = \\sqrt{\\delta \\alpha['']^2 + \\delta \\delta['']^2 } \\cdot d [ mpc ]   \\cdot   ( 206.265)^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath11 = 0.97 \\cdot r [ kpc]/\\delta v_{sky } [ km / s]\\ ] ] having @xmath12 .    with these assumptions , @xmath4 represents , for each companion , the minimum time needed for this galaxy to go away from the polar ring .    for those prs and normal galaxies without known redshift , or whose",
    "companions lack this value , we listed only in table [ companions ] the number of galaxies present within @xmath8=30having a magnitude difference @xmath13 1 with respect to the central galaxy .",
    "examining table [ companions ] we note that 24 over 31 polar rings with known distance have at least one gas - donor candidate galaxy . for each of these prs ,",
    "we indicate in table [ companions ] the nearest galaxy in terms of minimum crossing time @xmath14 . according to the redshift and separation from the pr",
    ", this possible donor may have encountered the pr in a time of the order of 1 gyr , which is typical of the models suggesting a long evolutionary time for the creation or the stabilization of the polar ring .",
    "a kolgomorov - smirnov test has been applied to the number of possible companions found around the prs with respect to that found around the ngs control sample .",
    "the cumulative distributions are shown in figure [ comp_ng ] .",
    "for the remaining prs , in the second part of table [ companions ] the nearest object is listed , together with its projected separation from the pr . here again , 20 over 25 prs have an object of similar magnitude in a radius lower than 27 . in this case , no statistical test is possible .",
    "in the analysis of the prs neighborhood , only the first three @xmath15 parameters are independent .",
    "they are : the number of objects , the cumulative diameter and the objects concentration .",
    "if a difference in the cumulative distribution of one of them exists , it will be present and amplified by the other three @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 parameters .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath15 parameters shows that there are no marked differences in the neighborhood of polar rings with respect to that of normal galaxies .",
    "this is shown in table [ ks ] , where none of the significance levels for the parameters is above 85% .",
    "this is still valid in the sample of pr galaxies whose distance is known , labeled `` volume test '' in table [ ks ] . in this search of close companions",
    ", we excluded six galaxies which are too large to be recognized as a single object by the analysis software ( used by apm or by focas ) .",
    "this fact may bias the sample if they would represent extended or younger objects .",
    "however , as visible from table [ sample ] , where these galaxies are identified by a @xmath19 , their linear size in kpc is not different from that of the other pr galaxies in the sample . if objects like ngc 660 may represents young , unstable structures , on the other side ic 3370 or ngc 3384 have a very smooth appearance and may be older and dynamically relaxed .    in the analysis of the bright galaxies that may have encountered the pr before 1 gyr , it is interesting to note the high frequency with which at least one galaxy of similar magnitude is found in the surrounding region",
    "however , in comparison with the field of ngs , this fact is not statistically significant at a level of 91% .",
    "it is obvious that one must be careful in applying a statistical test to an analysis involving a single object . when a galaxy with a very similar red - shift lies near the polar ring , it is hard to think that a gravitational link between them is not present .",
    "the possibility that the present bright companions of prs interacted with them must be analyzed for each single case .    in conclusion",
    ", the environment of prs does not appear _ statistically _ different from that of normal galaxies .",
    "the number of fields surveyed in this paper is not large , but the result seems to be different from that reached for galaxies where interaction produces an observable nuclear activity , such as active galaxies or quasars ( dahari 1984 , heckman  1985 , hintzen  1991 , rafanelli 1995 ) , whose environments appear possibly richer than that of the normal galaxies .",
    "our data suggest that , if the event generating the pr was a mass transfer from a companion galaxy or a satellite ingestion , _ it should have happened in a remote epoch _ for the most part of galaxies and left almost no traces in the present .",
    "this idea seems supported by some arguments from this work and from the literature .",
    "first , the close environment around the prs studied does not appear perturbed at the present epoch ( table 3 ) .",
    "second , some polar rings show a quantity of gas too high to derive from the ingestion of a single dwarf , late - type galaxy ( richter  1994 , galletta  1997 ) .",
    "these massive rings are stabilized by the mechanism of self - gravitation ( sparke 1986 ) .",
    "their formation may have occurred in the early phases of the galaxy s life , when the number of late - type galaxies and their gas content were higher and the amount of accreted gas in a single encounter could have been large .",
    "third , there is at least one galaxy of comparable size near almost all prs ( table 4 ) . with few exceptions these galaxies are not at present interacting with the pr , but they may have been gas donors in the past for the building of the ring . finally , some models indicate ring formation times larger than 1 gyr ( @xcite ) and/or a persistence of the ring until the end of the simulation ( 2.2 gyr for @xcite and 7.2 gyr for @xcite ) . a further support to this hypothesis",
    "may be given by the recent result of reschetnikov ( 1997 ) on the detection of prs in the hubble deep field .",
    "he found that the number of prs present in a 5 arcmin@xmath20 field , 2 objects , is consistent with a pr space density increasing in the past .",
    "the alternative explanations encounter some difficulties .",
    "the hypothesis that all the pr originates from the recent accretion of small satellites is not supported by the fact that many prs are too massive to derive from the gas contained in a present - day dwarf galaxy .",
    "in addition , we may expect that an environment that is at present favoring the formation of a pr should be different from that of normal galaxies , which not seems confirmed by our results .",
    "the alternative that a pr forms by means of a slow infall of diffuse , primordial gas appears contradicted by the observations of emission lines in the rings . these are typical of gas regions observed in our galaxy ( co , [ n ii ] , [ sii ] , [ oiii ] ) and show the presence of dust , which is a typical product of stellar evolution .",
    "in addition , it seems difficult for a slow infall to produce very inclined structures of low mass , because of the tidal torque of the host galaxy ( @xcite ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the hypothesis that the majority of present prs are ` fossil ' structures born in the early universe may be in agreement with the present data on the environments and with the presence of both massive and small prs .",
