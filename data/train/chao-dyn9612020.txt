    "the semiclassical quantization of a hamiltonian system is deeply connected to the structure of its phase space .",
    "the generic hamiltonian system contains a complicated mixture of near - integrable and chaotic motion , and a consistent semiclassical quantization scheme does not exist for the generic case .",
    "it does exist , however , in the non - generic limiting cases , the integrable and the ergodic systems .    during the last two decades",
    "much progress has been made for ergodic systems .",
    "the gutzwiller trace formula gives the density of states as a sum over periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "it works well if all periodic orbits are unstable and isolated , i.e.  for hyperbolic systems , and is the starting point for most calculations in this field .",
    "the investigation of integrable systems reaches back to the beginning of quantum mechanics .",

    "the hydrogen atom is the most famous example .",
    "the deficiency of the old quantum mechanics to calculate , e.g. , the spectrum of the helium atom was set into clear light by einstein @xcite .",
    "he formulated the bohr - sommerfeld quantization conditions in terms of invariant tori which foliate the phase space of integrable systems .",
    "moreover he noted that this foliation is absent in generic systems , such that this quantization scheme fails .",
    "the same year when schrdinger introduced his famous equation brillouin explained that the quantization of tori is a consequence of the single - valuedness of the quantum mechanical wave functions .",
    "keller showed how the quantization conditions have to be modified because of caustics in the classical motion @xcite .",

    "this paper deals with a nontrivial example of an integrable system : the planar elliptic billiard .",
    "classically `` billiard '' refers to a system in which a point particle moves freely inside a domain and is elastically reflected at the domain boundary .",
    "the corresponding quantum mechanical problem is to solve the laplace equation inside the domain with dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "billiards have become popular because for them on the one hand the classical calculations are easier than for systems with smooth potential , and on the other hand they allow for experimental measurements , e.g.   @xcite .",
    "jacobi @xcite showed that elliptic coordinates separate the geodesic flow on the ellipsoid , which contains our billiard as a limiting case .",
    "the same coordinate system leads to the separation of schrdinger s equation , including the dirichlet boundary condition , into two mathieu equations .",
    "integrability allows for a semiclassical quantization  la _ ebk_. in our case , however , there are problems due to the presence of a separatrix . for all energies",
    "it divides phase space into regions of rotational and oscillatory motion @xcite .",
    "the maslov indices are different for the two classical regions , resulting in a discontinuity in the _ ebk _  quantization condition which in turn leads to ambiguities for states close to the separatrix . to overcome this problem",
    "it is necessary to introduce a uniform quantization condition .",
    "this can be done by investigating the asymptotics of the solutions of schrdinger s equation close to the separatrix , which was carried out for the elliptic billiard in @xcite .",
    "we will follow a different approach based on connection matrices between the amplitudes of _ wkb _  wave functions , see @xcite , the review of berry and mount @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "this approach can be interpreted in terms of orbits with complex classical action .",
    "a transformation of the quantum mechanical eigenvalues to classical action space allows for a unique mapping of the eigenvalues to the quantum numbers .",
    "the discontinuity in the _ ebk _  quantization condition carries over to the berry - tabor trace formula @xcite - the analogue of the gutzwiller trace formula for integrable systems .",
    "the resonant tori , foliated by families of periodic orbits , take over the role of the isolated periodic orbits as the objects to be summed over .",
    "the uniformization employed in @xcite incorporates the influence of orbits with negative classical action in the vicinity of isolated stable periodic orbits .",
    "we will introduce a modification of the berry - tabor trace formula which takes care of the separatrix in terms of an effective maslov phase varying smoothly across .",
    "it will turn out that in order to correctly produce eigenstates close to the separatrix the summation has to be taken over non - periodic orbits , i.e.  over classical tori with in general irrational winding number .",
    "this trace formula incorporates all kinds of classically non - real orbits .",
    "the berry - tabor trace formula was further investigated by richens  @xcite , who showed that it contains contributions of the stable isolated periodic orbits , whose contributions are equal to the corresponding terms in the gutzwiller s trace formula  @xcite .",
    "we will use his results in the study of the length spectrum , extending the `` inverse quantum chaology '' , see e.g.  @xcite , to integrable systems .",
    "after completion of this work there independently appeared a preprint by m.  sieber @xcite , whose first part contains considerations similar to parts of our paper .",
    "nevertheless , the key point of his paper being the semiclassical consequences of the deformation of an elliptic billiard to an oval , while we concentrate on the separatrix and on complex orbits , the overlap is only mild .",

    "it remains an open question how a uniformization should come about in terms of a green s function derivation of the berry - tabor trace formula @xcite .",
    "it is by no means obvious how the variable maslov phase should be emulated by , say , a summation over complex orbits .    in the study of the length spectrum of our integrable system we focused on the case where the stable orbit has a rational winding number . in this case",
    "the divergent gutzwiller term has to be replaced by a thin torus contribution obtained by richens .",
    "the four types of dominant contributions in the trace formula can be analytically fourier transformed , such that the inverse spectrum can be explicitly written as a sum over periodic objects .",
    "we found a remarkably good agreement , even though in this approach only the real complex tori are partially incorporated in the richens term .",
    "it is an open question why the inverse spectrum is so much less sensitive to the presence of the separatrix in our case",

    "one can take the elliptic billiard as a starting point for the penetration into the nonintegrable regime by a deformation of the billiard boundary .",

    "<S> the quantum eigenvalues show a clear pattern when transformed into the classical action space . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of the separatrix on the wave functions is illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> a uniform _ wkb _  quantization taking into account complex orbits is shown to be adequate for the semiclassical quantization in the presence of a separatrix . the pattern of states in classical action space is nicely explained by this quantization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we extract an effective maslov phase varying smoothly on the energy surface , which is used to modify the berry - tabor trace formula , resulting in a summation over non - periodic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> this modified trace formula produces the correct number of states , even close to the separatrix . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of the density of states is explained in terms of classical orbits , and the amplitude and form of the different kinds of peaks is analytically calculated . </S>"
