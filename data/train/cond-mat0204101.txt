    "as well known ,  @xcite in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) regime magnetic field dependences of off - diagonal , @xmath5 , and diagonal , @xmath6 , components of dc conductivity tensor are very much different .",
    "namely , @xmath5 shows a set of flat plateaus with abrupt steps taking place at half - integer values of the filling factor @xmath7 where @xmath3 is sheet density of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) while @xmath8 is the quantum magnetic length . on the contrary , @xmath9 is extremely small at the plateaus and has sharp maxima at the steps between the hall plateaus , i. e. at _ half - integer _ filling factors .",
    "the conventional explanation is that at a half - integer @xmath10 electronic states the fermi level are _ extended _ while apart of the half - integer values of @xmath10 they are _",
    "localized_.    a powerful way to investigate the interplay between extended and localized states is an analysis of _ ac _ conductivity by acoustical methods .",
    "@xcite a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) propagating in a vicinity of a 2deg layer produces a wave of electric field penetrating the 2deg .",
    "this wave creates currents which , in turn , produce a feedback to the saw . as a result ,",
    "both saw attenuation @xmath11 and velocity @xmath12 depend on the properties of the 2deg .",
    "in particular , simultaneous measurements of attenuation and velocity of saw provide a unique possibility to determine _ complex _ ac conductivity , @xmath13 , as a function of external magnetic field @xmath14 and saw frequency @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field dependence of complex conductivity provides an information both on the extended and localized states , as well as on metal - to - insulator transition .    as we observed earlier ,  @xcite near the steps on hall conductance , i. e. at half - integer @xmath10 ,",
    "imaginary part of the complex ac conductance is small while its real part coincides with the dc transverse conductance , @xmath9 .",
    "however , in the magnetic fields corresponding to regions near the middles of the hall plateaus , i.  e. at small integer @xmath10 , the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath9 turns out to be crucial .",
    "namely , @xmath9 is extremely small while both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are measurable quantities and @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , up to our experimental accuracy , the dissipative conductivity , @xmath20 is proportional to saw frequency and weakly dependent on the temperature .",
    "according to ref .  , these facts lead to the conclusion that the mechanism of ac conductance is _ hopping_.    in our experiment , the saw is induced by inter - digital transducers at the surface of a piezoelectric linbo@xmath21 plate .",
    "samples are layered structures placed on the plate , so the interface layer is located at some distance from the piezoelectric surface .",
    "if the conductance of the interface layer is low , then the ac electric field produced by the saw decays as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the saw wave vector while @xmath24 is the distance from the propagation surface . in the following",
    "we assume that both the piezoelectric plate and the samples layers are parallel to the @xmath25-plane and magnetic field @xmath26 is directed along @xmath24-axis .",
    "consequently , it is the region of the thickness @xmath27 that contributes to acoustic properties of the system .",
    "however , a perfectly conducting layer placed at a distance @xmath28 above the surface _ screens _ the ac electric field and confines the electric current inside the layer . as a result , in this case both saw attenuation and velocity are determined mostly by the processes inside the interface layer . an estimate for the dimensionless parameter discriminating between the cases of weak and strong",
    "screening is the ratio @xmath29 . since @xmath6 is a strong function of magnetic field , variation of the magnetic field changes the screening of the ac electric field . as a result , at different magnetic fields different layers of the sample",
    "provide the dominant contribution to @xmath16 . in particular , at the hall plateaus `` shunting '' of the interface layer by a doped",
    "one can be dominant .",
    "a more detailed analysis  @xcite for si @xmath30-doped gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructures has shown that it is the case .",
    "namely , at the hall plateaus the doped layer s contribution to @xmath17 turns out to be important . at the same time , its contribution to the dc transverse conductance remains negligibly small .    a procedure outlined in ref .",
    "allowed us to separate the contribution in the ac conductance in qhe regime of the interface layer and the doped layer using their different magnetic field dependences .",
    "what we found is that the second contribution significantly fluctuates from one experimental run to another .",
    "a preliminary analysis has lead us to a conclusion that what we observe is a _",
    "systematic _ dependence on cooling procedure rather than random fluctuations - the sample somehow `` remembers '' the experiment preparation conditions .",
    "furthermore , the doped layer contribution appears also sensitive to the sample illumination .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a systematic study of the `` memory effects '' in si @xmath30-doped and modulated doped gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructures by the acoustic method for different cooling and illumination procedures .",
    "we will show that both the ac conductivity @xmath31 and sheet electron density in the interface layer , @xmath3 , are influenced by the above mentioned procedures .",
    "however , in a rather wide region of parameters there exists a _ universal _",
    "correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath3 irrespectively of the way to produce a given @xmath3 . a consistent qualitative explanation of the observed phenomena can be achieved by a suggestion that the memory effects are due to the so - called @xmath4 centers  @xcite which are two - electron localized states bound by a negative correlation energy , see , e. g. , ref .   for a review .",

    "its important feature is that there is no direct mechanical coupling between the linbo@xmath21 substrate and the sample because some finite clearance .",

    "the two - electron state has the lowest energy if the two electron correlation energy @xmath88 exceeds the thermal energy @xmath89.@xcite as a result , at @xmath90 the the defects are either occupied by two electrons and negatively charged ( @xmath91-centers ) or empty and positively charged ( @xmath92-centers ) .",

    ", we assume that a set of equal number of @xmath91 and @xmath92 states form the ground state which is the only state occupied at very low temperature . the one - electron ( neutral ) state @xmath93 has the energy higher than the ground state energy by the correlation energy o@xmath88 .    in heterostructures",
    ", one can imagine several processes taking place during a cooling from the room temperature to 1.5  k. among them are freeze - out of the carriers in the si - doped layer of al@xmath0ga@xmath1as to occupy first deep @xmath91 states and then shallow states,@xcite carriers exchange between the doped and the interface layers , etc .",
    "we believe that under rapid cooling the electron distribution at the pre - cooling temperature @xmath54 is frozen - it does not significantly change during the cooling below @xmath54 .",
    "this statement is compatible with a crude estimate of the activation energy based on the expression @xmath94 ev which has been obtained for al@xmath85ga@xmath86as films for @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite for our samples , this estimate yields @xmath96  mev . consequently , @xmath97 varies from @xmath98 to @xmath99 as @xmath100 varies from 300 to 100 k.    acoustic methods under conditions of the qhe provide a unique possibility to separate the contributions of the interface and doped layers .",
    "indeed , at the qhe plateaus the electronic states in the interface layer are _ localized _ , and their contribution to @xmath6 are small . as a result",
    ", the contribution of the electron hopping in the _ doped layer _ becomes measurable .",
    "@xcite we believe that the main mechanism leading to this contribution is due to tunneling transition of electron pairs ( bipolarons ) between a @xmath91 center and an adjacent @xmath92 one . at low temperatures",
    "sequential tunneling via the neutral states @xmath93 is probably not important since the energy difference between @xmath93 and the ground state is of the order of @xmath101  ev .",
    "however , @xmath93 states play an important role in the formation of the tunneling barrier between @xmath91 and @xmath92 centers . a theory of ac hopping conductance due to @xmath4-centers in three - dimensional amorphous materials has been developed in ref .  .",
    "according to this theory , is is rather difficult to discriminate between single - electron and two - electron tunneling from frequency and temperature dependences of @xmath2 .",
    "we are not aware of a theory of ac hopping conductance relevant to pair tunneling in gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructures .",

    "assuming that the doped layer s thickness is much less than @xmath41 we can use for @xmath58 an estimate similar to the well - known expression for the single - electron tunneling ,  @xcite @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the density of states for bipolarons , @xmath104 is their localization length , while @xmath105 is the electron charge .",

    "part of released electrons tunnels into the interface layer that results in the increase in the sheet density @xmath3 .",
    "a similar effect occurs during a rapid cooling due to quenching of the electron transfer between the defects and 2d layer . the higher the pre - cooling temperature @xmath54 the less time left for the electrons to tunnel into the interface layer . as a result ,",
    "@xmath3 is a decreasing function of @xmath54 .",
    "it worth mentioning that there is an important difference between the dc persistent photoconductance and the effect we observe .",
    "indeed , in the first case the conductance is possibly due to extended electron states either in the 2deg - layer or in the conduction band in al@xmath0ga@xmath1as layer .",
    "contrary , the states responsible for the ac conductance are _ localized _ that follows from the relation @xmath106 .",
    "illumination leads to a _ decrease _ in the number of occupied bound states .",
    "as a result , the ac conductance decreases with illumination . at very high illumination dose",
    "the @xmath4 centers become ionized , and all the ac conductance is due to extended states .",
    "we have employed the procedure of ref .   to separate the contributions of the doped layer and of the 2d layer in the ac hopping conductance and then analyzed the latter using a picture of single electron nearest - neighbor tunneling . tuning the 2deg density by illumination after slow cooling to change the magnetic field @xmath14 corresponding @xmath62 from 2.7 to 3.8  t we have found that the localization length @xmath107 in this region behaves as @xmath108 .",
