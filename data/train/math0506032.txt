    "* these are @xmath76 , the limits of the interval of exponents @xmath77 $ ] for which the semigroup @xmath78 is @xmath0 bounded , and @xmath79 , the limits of the interval of exponents @xmath80 $ ] for which the family @xmath81 is @xmath0 bounded .",
    "we make a thorough study of these numbers , their inner relationships and their values in terms of dimension for the whole class of such @xmath19 ( section 4 ) .",
    "the key stone of this theory , which makes use of the divergence structure of our operators , is that the @xmath0 boundedness of their semigroups ( resp .",
    "of the gradient of their semigroups ) is * equivalent * to some * off - diagonal estimates * and also to some * hypercontractivity*.   different from 1 , although not explicitely stated in the literature to our knowledge , is in the air of a number of works dealing with semigroups of elliptic operators .",
    "it appears first in davies s work @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and the references therein . ]",
    "to be precise , we sometimes have to loosen the exponent @xmath52 , but this is harmless for the kind of results we are after .",
    "let us mention here that this equivalence is not powerful enough for treating @xmath8 decay of the semigroup kernels whenever there is @xmath82 or @xmath8 boundedness of the semigroup .",
    "but , again , this is enough for our needs .",
    "next , we turn to studying the harmonic analysis objects ( sections 5 , 6 & 7 ) . on the one hand ,",
    "finding necessary conditions on @xmath52 for which one has @xmath0 bounds for the functional calculus , the square functions , the riesz transforms is intuitively easy and the critical numbers appear then . on the other hand , it is not clear at all why these conditions * alone * suffice .",
    "for this , appropriate criteria for @xmath0 boundedness with minimal hypotheses are needed .",
    "the @xmath0 estimates obtained in sections 5 , 6 & 7 depend on the critical numbers of a given operator .",
    "thus , they are individual results with sharp ranges of @xmath52 s , the operator norms depending on dimension , the ellipticity constants and some of the critical numbers .",
    "but when the critical numbers can be estimated for operators in some class , they become @xmath0 estimates for the whole class . in this case",
    ", the optimality of the range of @xmath52 s is function of the sharpness of the bounds on the critical numbers .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec : sharpness ] for second order operators and in section [ sec : higherorder ] for higher order .",
    "as the reader may guess , the various critical numbers have no reason to be 1 or @xmath83 .",
    "hence , we have a class of operators that lies * beyond the class of caldern - zygmund operators*. we wish here to present an appropriate machinery to obtain @xmath0 boundedness without caring about kernels of operators and for ranges of @xmath52 different from the usual intervals @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( see section [ sec : cz ] for more ) .",

    "another route is to begin with their @xmath128 boundedness ,   interpolation between @xmath21 and @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and duality for @xmath127 .",

    "this is enough for numerous operators going from convolution operators such as the hilbert transform and the classical riesz transforms ( the prototypes of caldern - zygmund operators ) to the cauchy integral on a lipschitz curve and the double layer operator on a lipschitz domain .",
