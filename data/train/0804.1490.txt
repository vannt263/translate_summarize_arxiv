    "multiantenna multiple access channel ( mimo - mac ) has recently received a great interest but optimal and practical design of space - time codes for this channel is still missing . after introducing the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) of a mimo channel in @xcite , tse _",
    "_ introduced the dmt of the mac in @xcite .",
    "it is a fundamental limit of the channel at high @xmath0 that can be used to evaluate the performance of different transmission schemes . still in @xcite",
    ", they proved that this dmt is achievable for sufficiently long codes by considering a family of gaussian random codes .",
    "however , these gaussian codes do nt have any structure which makes their efficient encoding and decoding impractical .",
    "nam and el gamal proposed in @xcite , a class of structured multiple access lattice space - time codes .",
    "they proved that their scheme , based on lattice decoding , achieves the optimal dmt of the mac but they did not give any constructive example .",
    "this fact lets us think that , as it was the case for the mimo channel @xcite , the construction of such lattice codes for the mac should use large alphabets with prime cardinality .    in @xcite , grtner and",
    "blcskei presented a detailed analysis of the mac based on the different error types that can be encountered in this channel ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they derived a space - time code design criterion for multiantenna macs and presented a structured coding scheme of length @xmath1 for @xmath2 transmit users with two transmit and two receive antennas .",
    "this code results from a simple concatenation of two alamouti codewords with a columns swapping for one user s codeword offering a minimum rank of three .",
    "this code highlights the importance of the joint code design in the mac , but does not achieve the outage dmt of the channel .",
    "grtner and blcskei further developped their work and presented in @xcite important results motivating the construction of space - time codes for the mimo - mac .",
    "they showed that their code design criteria are optimal with respect to the dmt of the channel and proved that , for a mimo - mac , outage analysis allows a rigorous characterization of the dominant error event regions .",
    "in other words , outage and error probabilities have the same behaviors at high @xmath0 .",
    "this fundamental result will be of a major importance in our work .    in this paper",
    ", we present a construction of a family of distributed space - time codes for the mimo - mac with no channel side information at the transmitters ( no csit ) based on the fundamental results in @xcite . by analyzing the different regimes of the dmt of the mimo - mac , we show that the new codes achieve the outage dmt of the channel .",
    "numerical results finally show that the proposed codes outperform the time sharing scheme and that the error probabilities of such codes mimic the outage probability behavior of the mimo - mac channel . in the sequel",
    ", we first present a general codes construction , _",
    "i.e. _ for the @xmath3 mimo - mac .",
    "then , as a detailed example , we consider the two - user mac case with @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we use boldface capital letters @xmath5 to denote matrices .",
    "@xmath6 represents the complex gaussian random variable .",
    "[ .]@xmath7 ( _ resp . _ [ .]@xmath8 ) denotes the matrix transposition ( _ resp .",
    "_ conjugated transposition ) operation .",
    "we consider a @xmath9-user multiple - access channel with @xmath10 transmit antennas per user and @xmath11 receive antennas .",
    "we assume that the channel matrices have _ i.i.d . _",
    "zero - mean gaussian entries , _ i.e. _ , @xmath12 .",
    "we denote @xmath13 the temporal codelength of the considered distributed space - time code @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a @xmath16 matrix denoting the codeword of user @xmath17 with normalized power , independent of codewords of the other users since we assume no cooperation between users .",
    "the received signal is @xmath18 where superscripts denote matrices dimensions .",
    "@xmath19 is the additive white gaussian noise matrix with _",
    "_ gaussian unit variance entries , _ i.e. _ , @xmath20 .",
    "the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) of multiple access channels was introduced and fully characterized in @xcite . a scheme @xmath21 is said to achieve multiplexing gain @xmath22 and diversity gain @xmath23 if@xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote respectively the data rate as a function of @xmath0 , measured in bits per channel use ( bpcu ) , and the block error probability .",
    "_ gave in @xcite the optimal achievable tradeoff @xmath27 of the mac channel which corresponds to the @xmath0 exponent of the outage probability .",
    "the network is assumed to be _ symmetric _ , _ i.e. _ , the diversity orders and the multiplexing gains per user are identical ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "the authors distinguished two loading regimes : the lightly loaded regime , _ i.e. _ @xmath28 , and the heavily loaded regime , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 . in the first regime , single - user performance",
    "is achieved , in other words , the presence of other users does not influence the channel performance , whereas in the second one , the system is equivalent to a mimo system as if the @xmath9 users pooled up their transmit antennas together .",
    "the global dmt is shown to be the minimum dmt between these two regimes , that is , the largest achievable symmetric diversity gain for fixed symmetric multiplexing gain , @xmath30 we have the following result denotes the outage dmt of a @xmath31 mimo rayleigh point - to - point channel . ]",
    "illustrated in figure [ fig : dmtgen ] @xmath32     users with @xmath33 transmit antennas each and a single receiver with @xmath34 antennas . ]",
    "it is noteworthy , though , that while for @xmath35 the use of a code designed for the single - user mimo channel is optimal , a jointly designed code will be of major importance in the case of @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , depending on the number of receive antennas , the antenna pooling regime may or may not exist : if @xmath35 , single - user performance is achieved for all @xmath22 and optimal space - time codes designed for the single - user mimo channel achieve the outage dmt , else , both the single user regime and the antenna pooling regime occur and should be taken into account in the code design .",
    "grtner and blcskei @xcite used an error event analysis , which was first introduced by gallager in @xcite , to establish the space - time code design criteria for the mac .",
    "such an approach consists in defining different error events , say event @xmath37 , depending on the number of users in error means @xmath17 users in error ] .",
    "different error regions are defined based on the users transmission rate .",
    "rate regions where single - user error events dominate can be treated by using well known space - time codes designed for the single - user case . however , the rate regions where the event of more than one user being in error dominates , require a joint code design .    it is interesting to recall the following result presented in @xcite :",
    "increasing the number of receive antennas results in a reduction of the size of the region where all users are in error and thus , decreases the importance of the joint code design .",
    "interestingly , this result confirms the previous dmt interpretation .",
    "the code design criteria that we use are derived in @xcite , based on the dominant error regions , using a refined upper bounded expression of the pairwise error probability ( pep ) and can be stated as follows    1 .",
    "_ rank criterion _ : for every codeword pair @xmath38 with @xmath39 the rank of the corresponding codeword difference matrix shall be maximized .",
    "eigenvalue criterion _ : for every codeword pair @xmath38 with @xmath39 the product of the nonzero eigenvalues of the corresponding codeword difference matrix shall be maximized .",
    "authors further showed that their space - time code design criteria are optimal with respect to the entire dmt and concluded that , a rigorous characterization of the dominant error event regions can be obtained by analysing the outage - dmt of the mac .",
    "the general @xmath3 mimo mac is considered in this section .",
    "we construct a new family of space - time codes for this channel following the same footsteps as the construction of perfect space - time codes for parallel mimo channels in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the modulation used by both users is a quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be a galois extension of degree @xmath9 on @xmath41 with galois group @xmath42 we denote @xmath43 a cyclic extension of degree @xmath33 on @xmath40 and @xmath44 the generator of its galois group , @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be in @xmath40 such that @xmath47 are not norms in @xmath43 .",
    "a cyclic division algebra of degree @xmath33 is constructed , @xmath48 . to remind the most relevant concepts about cyclic algebras and how to use them to build space - time block codes",
    ", we let the reader refer to @xcite .",

    "the equivalent joint codeword matrix can be written as @xmath55\\label{eq : codeword - eq - gen}\\ ] ]    such a code uses @xmath56 information symbols per user . in order to check the rank design criterion given in @xcite",

    "we choose @xmath62 with entries in @xmath41 and such that @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "with such a code , we can state ,    @xmath58 achieves the outage dmt of the mimo - mac    we give here a sketch of proof , details are omitted for lenght constraint . the idea is to prove that by scaling the size of the underlying qam constellations by a factor of @xmath65 , the exponent of @xmath0 in the asymptotic expression of the error varies as the optimal dmt .",
    "if only one user , say @xmath54 , is in error the receiver can cancel signals it receives from the other @xmath66 users and the system is equivalent to a single - user @xmath31 mimo system . in this case , the transmitted codeword @xmath61 is given in ( [ eq : codeword_gen_per_user_sigma ] ) .",
    "the code is equivalent to well - known codes constructed on cyclic division algebras and thus is dmt achieving , @xcite .",
    "if all users are in error , the system is equivalent to an @xmath67 mimo channel and the transmitted codewords are given in ( [ eq : codeword - eq - gen ] ) . in order to preserve the shaping of the code",
    ", matrix @xmath57 should be unitary .",
    "the dmt achievability is guaranteed by the carefull choice of @xmath57 .",
    "for example , we can choose @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a transcendantal number .",
    "in that case , the determinant of a codeword , which is a polynomial function of @xmath69 with coefficients in @xmath43 , is non zero .",
    "as it is proven in @xcite , this result is sufficient to prove the outage dmt achievability .",
    "@xmath71\\label{eq : xi}\\ ] ]      as an example , we consider a two - user mac with two transmit antennas per user and three receive antennas , _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",
    "based on ( [ eq : dmt_min ] ) , we can write the optimal dmt in this scenario as follows @xmath73 this outage - dmt is illustrated in figure [ fig : dmt-223 ] . two outage events , leading to the achievable region , are observed : event @xmath74 where only one user is in outage , the other one being perfectly decoded at the receiver and event @xmath75 when both users are in outage .",
    "dmt of the @xmath76 mac ]    our goal is to design distributed space - time codes for this channel that are optimal in the sense of the dmt . in other words ,",
    "the error probability of the proposed scheme should behave asymptotically as the outage probability of the channel .",
    "for the two - user mac with @xmath4 , we propose the following code .",
    "each user s codeword is an @xmath77 matrix constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath78 be an extension of @xmath41 of degree @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , such a design leads to construct the golden code @xcite on the base field @xmath82 instead of the base field @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath83 has been proven in @xcite not to be a norm , which guarantees that @xmath84 has a non zero determinant .",

    "the performance of the proposed coding scheme is then measured by the word error rate ( wer ) _ vs _ received @xmath0 and compared to the time sharing scheme where the channel is shared among the users in an orthogonal multiple - access manner .      at the receiver side",
    ", we use a minimum mean - square error decision feedback equalizer mmse - dfe preprocessing combined with lattice decoding as a way to tackle the problem of the rank deficiency resulting from @xmath34 being smaller than @xmath112 . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that an appropriate combination of left , right preprocessing and lattice decoding , yields significant saving in complexity with very small degredation with respect to the ml performance .",
    "more precisely , left preprocessing modifies the channel matrix and the noise vector such that the resulting closest lattice point search has a much better conditioned channel matrix .",
    "moreover , right preprocessing is used to change the lattice basis such that it becomes more convenient for the searching stage .",
