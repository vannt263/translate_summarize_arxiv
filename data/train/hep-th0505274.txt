    "at the time of the writing of this article , intersecting d6-branes in type iia string theory are already a long - studied topic of perturbative string theory .",
    "it started off by the insight that chiral fermions are possible in these models @xcite and now has been proven to be a well - justified complementary approach to the heterotic string , for a broader introduction see for instance @xcite and references within .    the goal of all these works is to derive the observed @xmath1 low energy spectrum of particle physics from string theory .",
    "this requires compactifications with unitary ( or orthogonal ) gauge factors with gauge groups of the standard model or a gut theory .",
    "in fact , only the standard model is well established experimentally , but extensions like gut groups [ e.g. a flipped @xmath2 or @xmath3 seem well motivated such that they also deserve a discussion from string theory .",
    "the same is true for @xmath4 spacetime supersymmetry , it is not experimentally found , but very well motivated theoretically and it will be searched for at the lhc . in case",
    "it was found , predictions for certain parameters of a supersymmetric extension of the standard model from string theory will be needed .",
    "but here one also has to mention the familiar problem of string theory in making definite statements , being the large perturbative vacuum degeneracy . in other words , in many cases there are distinct perturbative string theoretical models which agree on some established features of the standard model , but differ in possible extensions .",
    "nevertheless , one hope is still that some regions of parameter space are at least excluded on the one hand and that maybe on the other hand some model features always appear together like for instance three quark generations with the same rank of the gauge group .",
    "it has to be said that so far , we can only make such statements for a very specific perturbative theory , like for instance for a certain @xmath5-orientifold in type iia . in recent times , a new approach has been proposed by douglas @xcite which is now commonly called the landscape . in this picture , the idea is not anymore to understand why we live in a specific vacuum of string theory , but instead to use statistics for getting an overall picture of the landscape of all vacua ( which has been estimated to be at least @xmath6 different flux vacua , see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "the presented paper @xcite contributes to this approach in the sense that it gives a complete classification of models on the @xmath0-orientifold , although statistical tools are actually not needed .",
    "[ ss : sec1 ] after having specified a certain perturbative string theory ( here we will use type ii plus additional d - branes ) , two questions still remain open .",
    "one tries to make reasonable assumptions for these two questions and later tries to justify them in a bottom - up approach .",
    "the first one asks for the nature of the six - dimensional compact subspace of the ten spacetime dimensions .",
    "several approaches have been pursued recently : most universal , general calabi - yau spaces have been treated in @xcite . in this approach , there is the problem that generally only the r - r tadpole and the chiral massless spectrum can be determined by homological data .",
    "the ns - ns tadpoles and the non - chiral massless spectrum can not be determined without a cft calculation which is only in some cases available .",
    "a large subset of such cases are the orientifolded and orbifolded toroidal models , which will be discussed soon .",
    "another alternative case where a cft description is available are the so - called gepner or minimal models which have led to decent phenomenological models within the last year @xcite",
    ".    the second open question asks which objects are living in spacetime , meaning in the present context the d - brane and orientifold content of the theory . of course",
    ", both objects are not independent of the given spacetime .",
    "the orientifold planes , being non - dynamical objects , actually are completely defined by dividing out some worldsheet and spacetime groups of the original spacetime , so this already depends on the answer to the first question . on the other hand ,",
    "the d - branes are dynamical objects and for a complete understanding the backreaction onto spacetime has to be taken into account .",
    "however , it is not necessary for the calculation of only the tadpole equation and the massless spectrum . for doing this ,",
    "d6-brane model building in type iia seems to be very attractive as d6-branes can wrap special lagrangian 3-cycles of the compact space .",
    "this leads to a very geometrical picture which will shortly be discussed in the following section .",
    "the starting point for our considerations is type i theory on a six - torus @xmath7 , whose closed string sector corresponds to type iib string theory if the world sheet parity @xmath8 has been gauged .",
    "formally , this gauging can be described by the introduction of orientifold 9-planes . in the language of topology ,",
    "this object is a cross - cap ( reversing the orientation of the worldsheet ) . in this picture ,",
    "type i theory can be understood as having a stack of 32 parallel d9-branes whose r - r - charge cancels the one from the orientifold plane .",
    "if one now adds a constant magnetic f - flux to the system , the requirement to have exactly 32 d9-planes is getting relaxed . in order to perform cft calculations , from now on it",
    "is assumed that the compact 6-torus is factorized into three 2-tori , i.e. @xmath9 .    a simpler way to understand this can be obtained by performing three t - dualities along the y - axes of the three 2-tori . then the former f - flux on the d9-branes ( which in general is assumed to be different for some stacks of d9-branes ) gets transformed into d6-branes wrapping complex 1-cycles on every @xmath10 , altogether a complex 3-cycle @xcite .",
    "the angles which every brane spans with the x - axes of every 2-torus are directly related to the former f - flux by @xmath11 it can be written in terms of so - called wrapping numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 which simply denote the number of times that a certain brane wraps the two fundamental cycles with radius @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the @xmath16th 2-torus , @xmath17 .",
    "the performed t - dualities furthermore map type iib into iia theory and the world sheet parity @xmath8 into the combination @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an anti - holomorphic involution .",
    "@xmath19 is a spacetime symmetry and can often be defined as e.g. a complex conjugation on the complex coordinates of the 2-torus , @xmath20 .",
    "this additional modded out symmetry has the effect that the orientifold plane does also wrap complex 1-cycles on every 2-torus .",
    "d6-branes with different angles in general do intersect both among themselves and with the orientifold plane .",
    "one obtains a very geometric picture as shown in figure [ fig : einf_bsp ] .      in the present case",
    ", one has to add a so - called mirror brane for every d6-brane to the system in order to keep @xmath21 invariance . in general",
    ", every stack of @xmath22 coinciding d6-branes at a particular angle supports a @xmath23 gauge factor if it does not coincide with the o6-plane ( if it does also @xmath24 and @xmath25 groups are possible ) . in @xcite",
    "it has been described that the chiral massless spectrum of a certain model only depends on the homological data .",
    "actually , the topological intersection number between different types of stacks of d - branes with themselves or the o - plane corresponds to the multiplicity of certain representations , or in other words , the number of particle generations .",
    "this correspondence is stated in table [ tab : massless_chiral_spectrum ] and pictured in figure [ fig : intersections ] .",

    "the first one is a @xmath53 symmetry and @xmath29 is twice the component of the right - handed weak isospin .",
    "@xmath31 is an additional @xmath51 symmetry under which only the two additional fields transform , but none of the standard model particles .",
    "the model has a massless hypercharge which is given by the combination @xmath54 .",
    "the two types of additional particles in the chiral fermion spectrum can be understood as the supersymmetric standard model partners of the higgs fields with a vanishing hypercharge , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this explanation requires an abelian brane recombination of the two branes @xmath57 and @xmath58 , triggering the breaking @xmath59 in the effective theory .",
    "it is shown in detail in @xcite that this mechanism always works and in the effective theory even can be understood as a higgs effect .",
    "all these results are indeed very promising and the phenomenology of the whole class of models with this chiral spectrum should be further explored .",
    "one of the most burning questions in this context are yukawa and gauge couplings @xcite , where it has to be mentioned that these do depend on the internal geometry and the full massless spectrum , and therefore are difficult to calculate .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that they are different for every concrete realization , maybe a statistical approach could rather handle this difficulty .      i would like to thank g. honecker and r. blumenhagen for interesting discussions and at the same time g. honecker and j. rosseel for proofreading this article .",
