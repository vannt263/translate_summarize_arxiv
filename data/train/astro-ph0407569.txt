    "@xmath0 carinae , one of the most massive stars known , is situated in the large hii region ngc 3372 , and is long known to be an irregularly variable source ( humphreys et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the most sudden change was around 1843 when it brightened by several magnitudes to @xmath71@xmath8 .",
    "the event is now known as the `` great eruption '' . shortly after the optical brightness decreased by more than 7@xmath8 . during this event a larger amount of mass has been ejected and formed @xmath0 carinae s circumstellar nebula .",
    "the first images of this nebula were made by gaviola ( 1946 ) and thackeray ( 1949 ) .",
    "gaviola named the nebula according to the geometry he identified at that time the _ homunculus_. it had a size of somewhat larger than 10 .",
    "today s images show the homunculus is symmetric  bipolar  and larger .",
    "it also turned out , that the homunculus is only the central part of the nebula around @xmath0 carinae ( e.g. walborn 1976 ) . in total",
    "the nebula extends to a diameter of 60  ( 0.67pc ) .",
    "the central bipolar structure , stilled called homunculus , has a diameter ( long axis ) of about 18  ( 0.2pc ) .",
    "all outer filaments ( outside the homunculus ) are combined into what is known as the _ outer ejecta_. the sizes and morphology of structures in the outer ejecta are manifold .",
    "contrary to the homunculus , the outer ejecta are not symmetric , nor a coherent structure , but rather contain numerous filaments , bullets or knots .",
    "the different morphology of the homunculus and the outer ejecta as well as the large difference in brightness , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hst ] here an hst image shows the homunculus , additionally plotted with contours , and the outer ejecta seen through an f658n filter . the homunculus and the outer ejecta are very prominent in the [ nii ] line .",
    "this is the result of the higher nitrogen abundance in the total nebula , due to the presence of cno processed material .",
    "analysis about the expansion velocities of the homunculus are about as old as the first images .",
    "ringuelet ( 1958 ) obtained 300  using proper motions ( using however a too small distance of 1.4kpc , newer distance estimates yield about 2.3kpc , so this velocity transforms into 500 ) .",
    "thackeray ( 1961 ) obtains values of roughly 650 . with better spectroscopy and hst astrometry",
    "it was shown that the homunculus , as images suggest , expands bipolar , with about 650(e.g .",
    "davidson & humphreys 1997 , currie et al . 1996 ) and with the south - east lobe approaching and the north - west lobe receding .",
    "[ hst ]    measurements of the expansion of the outer ejecta have been made determining again the proper motion of the brightest structure , e.g.  the e condensations ( e.g.   walborn & blanco 1988 ) . fabry - perot measurements and high - resolution echelle observations followed and showed that the outer ejecta has on average similar expansion velocities as the homunculus ( e.g. meaburn et al .",
    "1996 , weis et al .",
    "the majority of the structures expanding with @xmath9 = 600 - 700 . a significant fraction of the filaments , however , move much faster , reaching velocities as high as 2000(weis 2001a , b ) .",
    "a few structures are as fast as 2500 - 3000 ( weis et al .  2001b , smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "additionally the kinematics show the outer ejecta to be a more ordered structure than expected from morphology . in the south - eastern region most filaments",
    "are blueshifted , while in the north - west the clumps are redhifted , see left panel in fig .",
    "[ kinx ] comparing this movement with the expansion of the homunculus the outer ejecta is following a similar expansion pattern .",
    "the outer ejecta expands bi - directional and with about the same symmetry axis as the homunculus .",
    "[ kinx ]    the nebula around @xmath0 carinae is detected in x - rays , as is the central object .",
    "originally barely resolved with the einstein satellite ( chlebowski et al .",
    "1984 ) the higher spatial resolution of rosat and chandra makes it possible to better separate the emission of the nebula from that of the harder central source . already with rosat",
    "it was found that the softer emission is roughly hook shaped ( e.g. corcoran et al .",
    "1994 , weis et al .",
    "2001a ) and agrees in its dimensions with the extension of the outer ejecta ( weis et al .",
    "2001a ) . the chandra / acis data ( weis et al .",
    "2004 ) are so far the images with the highest spatial resolution and at the same time had decent spectral resolution .",
    "[ kinx ] shows in contours the x - ray emission overplotted on an hst image . the central source  which might be slightly extended  is very hard and as known from other observations variable ( e.g. corcoran et al .",
    "1995 , ishibashi et al .  1999 , weis et al .",
    "the emission which results from the outer ejecta is much softer and shows a hook shape , plus a bridge like connection which crosses the central object from the south - west end of the hook to the ridge in the north - east ( weis et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the _ scondensation _ ( walborn 1976 ) , is the brightest x - ray feature and agrees well with the bright optical filament .",
    "the expansion velocities derived from our optical echelle spectra ( see weis 2001a , b ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ kinx ] ( left ) . in regions with on average",
    "faster moving clumps the intensity of the x - ray emission is higher , too .",
    "the morphology of the extended soft x - ray emission from @xmath0 carinae can therefore be explained by shocks formed through the interaction of the faster moving filaments .",
    "spectra extracted from the 0th order image of the chandra / acis - s data have been modeled using a one temperature , thermal equilibrium model ( mewe - kaastra - liedahl ) and a fixed column density .",
    "fits to the data yield an average temperature of @xmath10 0.65 kev ( weis et al .",
    "gas of this temperature indicates velocities of the shocking gas around 750 , in good agreement to the detected average expansion velocities .",
    "[ strings ]    the _ strings _ are long , highly collimated structures that point nearly radially away from @xmath0 carinae and emerge from the outer ejecta region that is closest to the homunculus , partly that is the _ sridge_. string1 ( fig .  [ strings ] ) is the longest with a total length 0.177pc and a width of equal or less than 0.003pc .",
    "string4 ( 0.13pc ) , string3 ( 0.085pc ) , string5 ( 0.058pc ) , and string2 ( 0.044pc ) follow , all with similar width . for a detailed description of the basic parameters of the strings",
    "see weis et al .",
    "the strings are nearly aligned with the long axis of the homunculus and their radial velocity increases as the string move outwards . for string1",
    "this increase ranges from @xmath11 to about @xmath12(weis et al .",
    "we observed the strings with the hst / stis ( g750 m grating ; 52@xmath10.5 aperture ) with the slits aligned along the strings .",
    "the spectra ranged from 6295 to 6867  all strings are identified in emission in the following lines : [ nii ] at 6548and 6583 , h@xmath13 , hei at 6678  and both [ sii ] lines at 6716 and 6731 .",
    "figure [ strings ] shows string1 in these lines .",
    "bullets originally believed to be the head of string1 are visible and appear detached from the string  below the continuum of the star in fig .",
    "[ strings ] ( right)they follow the linear velocity increase well . the spectra show the strings to be more a steady flow rather than bullets along a chain .",
    "the origin of string1 is sudden , within the southern part of the s ridge .",
    "it seems not to extend back into the homunculus , fig.[strings ] ( right ) .",
    "also a split which was suggested to occur in string1 ( weis et al .",
    "1999 ) was confirmed in the stis data . using the [ sii ] line ratio and a temperature of about 14000k ( a typical value in s ridge , dufour et al .",
    "1997 ) we obtain an electron density of about 1.2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio lies close to the high density limit and is more of a conservative lower limit and might be higher .",
    "the results agree well with electron densities in the outer ejecta ( sridge ) determined by dufour et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using the siiii ] lines . with the help of the electron density and kinematics of string1",
    "one can calculate the mass and determine the kinetic energy associated with the string . with the measured electron density we derive a mass density @xmath14 of 1.6 10@xmath15kg@xmath4 ( using cosmic abundances ) .",
    "using a volume of the string of 3.7 10@xmath16@xmath17 , the mass @xmath18 of string1 is about 3 10@xmath5m@xmath6 if it is completely filled . with a lower limit on the average expansion velocity of @xmath19450",
    "the total kinetic energy @xmath20 is about 6 10@xmath21ergs . or using the cross section @xmath22 , a kinetic luminosity @xmath23 can be estimated which is about 1l@xmath6 .",
    "several mechanism have been proposed to explain the strings , like trails left by a bullet ( weis et al .",
    "1999 , redman et al .",
    "2002 , poludnenko et al .",
    "2003 ) , shadowing effects ( soker 2001 ) or a steady gas flow ( weis et al .",
    "the new data show the strings to be dense ( 10@xmath3@xmath4 ; but might be hollow ) but no density gradient was detected along the string which could give rise to a denser leading head , ruling out the bullet scenario .",
