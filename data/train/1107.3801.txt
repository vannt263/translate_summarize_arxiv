    "it is known that all massive galaxies have a central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet it is unknown why only a small fraction of these smbhs are actively accreting as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "several theories attempt to explain the fueling mechanism of agn : major mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , minor mergers and gravitational instabilities within the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nuclear starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supernova explosions within nuclear starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and collisions of warm halo clouds with the nuclear region @xcite .",
    "given the large range of observed agn properties , it is likely that different fueling mechanisms come into play for different agn populations .",
    "current observations suggest that powerful quasars are triggered by major mergers but moderate luminosity agn are more likely to be triggered by stochastic fueling incidents @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear which fueling mechanisms are dominant in which portions of the agn population .    the unified model of agn @xcite explains the different observed levels of agn obscuration as a simple geometric effect .",
    "this model assumes that the central engines of all agn are identical and the level of obscuration is dependent on the line of sight between the observer and the central engine .",
    "thus type 2 agn are obscured by column densities @xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , because the observer is looking through the dusty torus , in contrast to type 1 agn which are unobscured ( @xmath4 @xmath2 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) because the observer is looking down the throat of the dusty torus . since the central engines are identical , it is expected that , on average , the host galaxies of various spectral types of agn will be similar . however , different black hole fueling mechanisms are likely to lead to different relationships between the various spectral types of agn . in the major merger agn fueling paradigm , the agn is triggered while deeply embedded in gas and dust and thus when the agn first turns on , it is highly obscured .",
    "eventually the radiation pressure pushes away the remaining gas and dust revealing an unobscured quasar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the major merger paradigm , type 1 and type 2 agn have host galaxies which are in different evolutionary stages .",
    "conversely , in the nuclear starburst fueling paradigm , type 1 and type 2 agn hosts can be similar since on average the unified model can hold @xcite .",
    "this shows that tests of the unified model can be used to explore which processes are viable options for agn fueling and in which sections of the agn population different mechanisms are relevant .    classifying the host galaxies of compton thick ( ct ) agn , agn with @xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath8 @xmath7 , is of special interest .",
    "it is expected that a large fraction of agn with ct levels of obscuration are in a young evolutionary stage characterized by rapid black hole and host bulge growth @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the host properties of ct agn may offer special insight into the agn triggering process and the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "large samples of ct agn are difficult to identify because , by definition , ct agn suffer from extreme levels of obscuration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , previous studies of agn host galaxies have not been able to study the stellar populations of ct agn .",
    "galaxy optical colors are often described in terms of the red sequence and the blue cloud , where objects located on the red sequence are characterized by massive older stellar populations and objects on the blue cloud are less massive and have young stellar populations and current star formation . between the red sequence and the blue cloud",
    "is a lightly populated region referred to as the green valley .",
    "some studies find that agn feedback is connected to the shut down of host star formation and thus certain types of agn hosts preferentially reside in the green valley ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus agn activity is potentially a stage in galaxy evolution where feedback from the agn could shut down star formation , causing the host galaxy to age from the blue cloud , across the green valley , and onto the red sequence @xcite .",
    "however , other studies find that the colors of an agn and its host are more closely related to the amount of available obscuring material rather than the evolutionary stage of the host stellar population @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that agn are intrinsically bimodal in color and that many agn which appear to be on the red sequence are actually located in the blue cloud once dust extinction is taken into account .",
    "thus further investigation is necessary to establish the nature of agn host galaxy stellar populations and the role of agn feedback in regulating star formation .",
    "this point is especially salient as several possible agn fueling mechanisms include either causal or concurrent star formation .",
    "some studies even show that agn obscuration may in part be due to nuclear starburst disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to understand how host galaxy processes affect the central smbh and the role of the central smbh in host galaxy evolution , the nature of stellar populations of agn hosts must be well understood .",
    "as agn hosts exhibit size - able object - to - object variability , it is difficult to elucidate trends in the agn population by fitting individual objects .",
    "thus , in order to study larger trends in agn ",
    "host galaxy interactions , the average stellar properties of a large ensemble of agn hosts is investigated here . to this end",
    "the stellar synthesis models of @xcite are used to explore the stellar populations of agn hosts . as in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the agn seds are calculated using the photoionization code cloudy @xcite .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ) synthesis modeling framework is used to characterize the agn population .",
    "the model seds are then used to move the cxrb framework into other wavelength regions .",
    "this allows the space density and evolution of agn host galaxies to be determined by the most comprehensive census of agn activity . by comparing these models against various observations in the optical through mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectral ranges ,",
    "constraints are placed on the average stellar populations of type 1 , compton thin type 2 ( here referred to simply as type 2 ) , and ct agn at various redshifts . in section [ sect : model ] the agn spectral model and stellar population model are described . section [ sect : results ] presents the results of the model . in sections",
    "[ sect : disc ] and [ sect : sum ] the results are discussed and summarized .",
    "ab magnitudes are used , unless otherwise stated , and @xmath9 = 0.7 , @xmath10 = @xmath11 = 0.7 is assumed as necessary .",
    "in order to study the average properties of agn host galaxy stellar populations , a model is created which combines knowledge of agn space density and evolution from deep x - ray surveys and cxrb population synthesis models with stellar population studies .",
    "a model sed is computed which includes the emission from the agn , the host galaxy stellar population , and ongoing dust enshrouded star formation .",
    "this agn and host sed covers the wide spectral range of hard x - ray to mid - ir .",
    "the calculation of the agn model sed is discussed in section [ sub : agn ] and the details of the host stellar population model sed calculation are discussed in section [ sub : bc03 ] . to account for dust enshrouded star formation ,",
    "the templates of @xcite are used , which extend from 5 @xmath0 m to 30 cm , and are determined by averaging empirical seds of local purely star forming galaxies . while dust enshrouded star formation may contribute to the galaxy sed at wavelengths shorter than 5 @xmath0 m , generally the near ir agn and host seds are dominated by either emission from the agn or the @xcite portion of the host sed .",
    "examples of the rest frame agn and host seds are shown in figure [ fig : sed ] , where the dot - dashed lines show agn seds , the dashed lines show stellar population seds , and the dotted lines show the @xcite templates .    a gaussian stellar mass ( @xmath12 ) distribution was used with @xmath13 = 10@xmath14 m@xmath15 and @xmath16 = 10@xmath17 m@xmath15 .",
    "the average @xmath12 was set at 10@xmath18 m@xmath15 with a standard deviation of 0.4 dex , in agreement with the sample of x - ray selected , @xmath1 @xmath19 1 agn hosts presented by @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the mass - to - light ratio of the host galaxy is constant within each waveband and thus the host galaxy flux scales linearly with the host @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the stellar population sed is calculated for @xmath12 = 1 m@xmath15 and then re - normalized to @xmath12 = 10@xmath14  10@xmath17 m@xmath15 before the stellar population and agn seds are combined . creating host seds at several masses in the agn host mass spectrum",
    "allows the consideration of agn and host colors for hosts of various masses . when considering space densities , however , it is important to consider not only the range of agn host masses but also the probability that an agn host be a certain @xmath12 .",
    "the space density calculations presented are therefore weighted sums across the mass spectrum of agn hosts where the weight is determined by the gaussian @xmath12 distribution described above . specifically , when calculating luminosity functions and number counts the weighted sum over the gaussian @xmath12 distribution is used ; however , when considering flux - flux plots , only the range of @xmath20 is used . in agreement with current observational results",
    ", the @xmath12 distribution used does not evolve with redshift @xcite .",
    "a variety of broad band data from the optical through mid - ir is used to constrain the host models .",
    "these model constraints are described in section [ sub : constrain ] , and include mid - ir number counts , the j band agn and host space density as a function of redshift and the absolute j band magnitude , @xmath21 , and the type 1 agn and host b band luminosity function .",
    "we begin by assuming that the unified model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) holds and therefore , since all agn are essentially the same system viewed along different lines of sight , there is only one class of agn host galaxies .",
    "it is known that the cxrb encodes the accretion history of smbhs and as such is a powerful tool for scientific inquiry into accretion processes @xcite .",
    "the cxrb synthesis model framework can be used in wavelength regions outside of the x - ray spectral region by modeling the seds of agn and their host galaxies .",
    "thus the advances in cxrb synthesis modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to further the understanding of agn at all wavelengths . particularly , cxrb synthesis models provide constraints on the distribution of @xmath4 , the fraction of type 2 agn , @xmath22 , and the fraction of ct agn , @xmath23 . here a simple @xmath4 distribution is assumed where type 1 agn are evenly distributed among @xmath24 = 20.0 , 20.5 , 21.0 , 21.5 , type 2 agn are evenly distributed among @xmath24 = 22.0 , 22.5 , 23.0 , 23.5 , and ct agn are evenly distributed among @xmath24 = 24.0 , 24.5 , 25.0 .",
    "@xcite showed that this @xmath4 distribution is consistent with cxrb observations and provides results which are negligibly different from the observed @xmath4 distribution of @xcite @xcite .",
    "the shape of the cxrb combined with deep x - ray surveys has also been used to constrain @xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". the normalization of @xmath22 is set such that at @xmath1 = 0 and @xmath30 = 41.5 , the type 2 to type 1 ratio is 4:1 ( see section 2.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "both the original and the composite model of ct agn evolution of @xcite are considered .",
    "the original , non - evolving model assumes that ct agn are a simple extension of the compton thin type 2 agn population and that , when assuming the @xcite hard x - ray luminosity function , @xmath1944@xmath31 of all obscured agn are ct . in this model",
    "there is a population of ct agn which are nearly as common as compton thin type 2 agn and which are in all ways similar to compton thin type 2 agn except for the presence of more obscuration along our line of sight .",
    "contrastingly , the composite model assumes that ct agn are a population of agn distinct from the compton thin type 2 agn population .",
    "simulations show that gas rich galaxy mergers will cause dust and gas to be funneled into the nuclear region of the galaxy , triggering star formation and accretion onto the central smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "due to the large reservoir of material , the smbh will accrete very rapidly and be very highly obscured @xcite .",
    "thus it is expected that ct agn are high eddington ratio sources .",
    "@xcite found that if all ct agn are rapidly accreting sources , than the local space density of ct agn is under - predicted , and thus a population of low eddington ratio ct agn are necessary to explain the observed space density of ct agn .",
    "these low accretion rate ct agn are likely obscured by molecular clouds within the host bulge .",
    "observational evidence of this low luminosity ct agn population has been found in the local universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that if ct agn have moderate eddington ratios , the space density of ct agn with @xmath25 @xmath3 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath33 at @xmath1 @xmath5 0 is greatly over - predicted .",

    "both the evolving model and the non - evolving model are consistent with the cxrb and the local space density of ct agn with @xmath25 @xmath3 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath33 @xcite .      in order to compute the model agn seds , the photoionization code cloudy version c08.00 @xcite",
    "is used , following the same procedure as in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "these seds cover the wavelength range of very hard x - ray through far - ir and include the transmitted agn emission , the diffuse emission emitted along the line of sight by the obscuring material around the agn , and the reflected emission off the inner face of the obscuring cloud .",
    "the inner radius of the obscuring material is assumed to be @xmath1910 pc .",
    "as in @xcite , the obscuring clouds are assigned neutral hydrogen densities , @xmath34 , in agreement with typical molecular clouds ; the compton thin clouds have @xmath34 = 10@xmath35 @xmath36 and the compton thick clouds have @xmath34 = 10@xmath37 @xmath36 .      the host galaxy stellar populations",
    "are modeled using galaxev @xcite .",
    "this model calculates stellar population seds over the wavelength range of 91 160 @xmath0 m . using an isochrone synthesis technique , galaxev can evolve stellar populations with three stellar evolution library options .",
    "we assume the stellar evolution models of the padova 1994 library and the stellar spectra of the stelib / basel 3.1 semi - empirical library .",

    "both the @xcite and @xcite initial mass functions ( imfs ) are available in the galaxev code . here",
    "we assume solar metallicity @xcite and the @xcite imf @xcite . the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions is assessed in section [ sect :",
    "results ] .",
    "galaxev also allows for a variety of star formation histories , including constant star formation rate , instantaneous bursts , and exponentially declining star formation rate .",
    "an exponentially declining star formation history @xcite with an @xmath40-folding time of 0.5 gyr is used here .",
    "this star formation history allows for a simple parametrization of the average age of the stellar population while not requiring the entire stellar population to be a single age .",
    "galaxev does not include re - radiation of energy absorbed by dust ; however , the majority of this re - emission by cool dust occurs at wavelengths longer than those considered here .",
    "the stellar population seds are computed in four different redshift bins : @xmath1 @xmath2 1 , 1 @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath2 2 , 2 @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath2 3 , and 3 @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath2 5 , where @xmath1 is the redshift .",
    "we assume that the host galaxy has a dominate stellar population ( dsp ) which is slightly younger than the average age of the universe in each redshift bin , and @xmath12 is given by the gaussian distribution described in section [ sub : method ] . a younger stellar population ( ysp ) which accounts for @xmath19 0.1@xmath12 @xcite is also included .",

    "for the stellar population models used here , @xmath41(4000 ) @xmath42 1.5 corresponds to a stellar population age of @xmath192 gyr .",
    "the age of the ysp and dsp in each redshift bin is summarized in table [ ages ] . at @xmath1 @xmath3 2 ,",
    "the older and younger stellar populations are the same age and thus at 2 @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath2 3 the entire stellar population is 2 gyr old and at 3 @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath2 5 the entire stellar population is 1 gyr old .",
    "extinction due to dust , as described by @xmath46 , is allowed to vary between redshift bins , but not within redshift bins .",
    "while in some objects the agn emission is likely to be extincted by extended dust structures within the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is not true for all objects .",
    "as this study focuses on modeling the average properties of agn and their hosts , a detailed modeling of the complex geometry of obscuring material in individual sources is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "thus , it is assumed here that all of the extinction suffered by the agn emission occurs within a few tens of parsecs of the central engine . the dust which extincts the stellar population",

    "also , it is found that if ct agn evolve like type 2 agn , then ct agn hosts are similar to type 2 agn hosts and if ct levels of obscuration are indicative of specific evolutionary stages in the agn life cycle , then ct agn hosts are also in specific evolutionary stages .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that @xmath22 evolves with @xmath25 and @xmath22 is likely to evolve with redshift .",
    "for both the evolving and non - evolving models , the ct agn host stellar populations suffer from at least as much dust extinction as the type 2 agn host stellar populations .",
    "observations suggest that at least some of the observed extinction of heavily obscured agn may be due to extended dust structures or molecular clouds within the host galaxy @xcite , so it is expected that the stellar populations of ct agn will be enshrouded in dust .",
    "it is within the limits imposed by the model constraints for the high eddington ratio ct agn hosts to have an average @xmath46 which is in agreement with ulirgs hosting agn @xcite .",
    "the agn evolution scheme , in which mergers trigger large nuclear starbursts and agn activity , claims that the agn activity will initially be very highly obscured while the black hole grows very rapidly .",
    "as the black hole grows , the radiation pressure on surrounding dusty gas will increase until the agn feedback blows out the obscuring material and halts the star formation in the host nuclear region @xcite . in this scheme",
    "ct agn should have young stellar populations and possibly high levels of on going star formation .",
    "the non - evolving model places a lower limit on the stellar population age of 1 gyr .",
    "however , when the enhanced star formation sources are included , the non - evolving model ct agn hosts have similar stellar ages to the type 2 agn hosts , in contrast to the expectations of the agn evolution scheme . for the high eddington ratio ct agn in the evolving model ,",
    "the lower limit on the stellar population age is 0.3 gyr , the average stellar age of ulirgs hosting an agn @xcite .",
    "the low eddington ratio ct agn hosts of the evolving model can be of similar age as the type 1 and type 2 agn , but the near and mid - ir predicted number counts are in better agreement with the observations if these agn hosts have slightly older stellar populations than the average type 1 and type 2 agn hosts .",
    "it has been demonstrated that galaxies hosting agn with lower [ oiii ] luminosities have larger values for @xmath41(4000  ) compared to galaxies hosting agn with high [ oiii ] luminosities @xcite .",
    "thus it is expected that agn with lower eddington ratios are in hosts with older stellar populations , in agreement with the findings of this study .",
    "the stellar populations of ct agn hosts for the evolving model and the non - evolving model are in agreement with the expectations from the agn evolution scheme .",

    "if the enhanced star formation sources are included , the non - evolving model agn hosts have stellar populations of similar age as the type 2 agn , and thus are in better agreement with the orientation based unified model than with the agn evolution scheme . the evolving model ct agn hosts are consistent with the agn evolution scheme regardless of the inclusion of the enhanced star formation sources .    in summary ,",
    "the non - evolving model ct agn hosts are a simple extension of the type 2 agn host population while the evolving model ct agn are consistent with the paradigm where major mergers cause both intense starbursts and agn activity . in the evolving model",
    ", low eddington ratio ct agn hosts will appear as galaxies with old and dusty stellar populations while the high eddington ratio ct agn hosts will appear as ir bright starburst galaxies .",
    "it is found that @xmath195 - 15@xmath31 of agn hosts can be enhanced star formation sources with an average sfr @xmath42 20 m@xmath15 yr@xmath33 , a factor of 10 higher than the majority of agn hosts .",
    "this is expected to be a lower limit of the fraction of enhanced star formation sources as some sources may have such highly embedded star formation that the majority of the reprocessed emission due to star formation is at wavelengths longer than 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "observations at longer wavelengths , such as in the far - ir with the _ herschel _ or the millimeter / sub - mm regime with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , are necessary for uncovering the evolution of star formation rates in agn hosts @xcite . even deep radio observations",
    "are a useful tool in determining the highly embedded star formation rates of agn hosts @xcite .",

    "it is found that more than half of agn hosts can be enhanced star formation sources .",
    "the fact that the mid - ir agn and host number counts are over - predicted by an average sfr @xmath3 2 m@xmath15 yr@xmath33 , despite observational evidence that there is a population of agn with an average sfr an order of magnitude higher than this upper limit , suggests that there are two populations of agn .",
    "the majority of agn hosts , at least at @xmath1 @xmath2 1 , have sfrs similar to local spiral galaxies and @xmath55 - 15@xmath31 of agn hosts have markedly higher sfrs .",
    "the existence of these two populations of agn hosts can be interpreted in two complimentary ways .",
    "the first interpretation is that the agn hosted by galaxies with enhanced sfrs are being fueled by different mechanisms than the lower star formation objects . at @xmath1 @xmath2 1 , the lower star formation objects are likely dying quasars which were triggered by major mergers while the enhanced star formation objects are likely seyferts which are both fueled and obscured by circumnuclear starburst disks , as investigated by @xcite .",
    "the other interpretation is that all agn are fueled by processes related to nuclear starbursts , whether those starbursts are triggered by mergers or through secular processes , and on average , the nuclear starburst phase overlaps with the active agn phase for @xmath55 - 15@xmath31 of the agn lifetime .",
    "further exploration of these two populations of agn hosts is necessary to determine the processes which trigger and fuel agn activity .",
    "it is well documented that the integrated emission of agn observed in deep x - ray surveys is insufficient to account for the intensity of the cxrb at @xmath1930 kev and that the shape of the cxrb necessitates that the missing population of agn be highly obscured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the uncertainties of the normalization of the cxrb and the agn hard x - ray luminosity functions , different models predict vastly different numbers of missing ct agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as these highly obscured agn are missed in deep x - ray surveys @xcite , it is important to consider other methods to identify the elusive ct agn population .",
    "one possibility is that the majority of x - ray bright optically inactive galaxies ( xbongs ) host ct agn @xcite .",
    "xbongs are x - ray sources found in deep surveys which have no optical counterparts with @xmath96 @xmath77 25.5 and make up a substantial portion of deep survey x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "it is thought that these sources are either heavily obscured agn and/or high redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "considering the sources above the dotted horizontal line in figures [ fig : fxtororig ] and [ fig : fxtorcomp ] suggests that a small fraction of optically faint x - ray sources may be ct agn , but the majority of this population is @xmath1 @xmath5 1 type 2 agn .",
    "thus it is unlikely that xbongs host the majority of the missing ct agn population .",
    "another method used to identify ct agn candidates is to search for infrared bright sources which have an infrared excess , usually defined by @xmath97 @xmath5 1000 , where @xmath98 is the 24 @xmath0 m flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for the evolving model the vast majority of these ct agn are high eddington ratio sources .",
    "this criteria will select a small number of type 2 agn with enhanced star formation , but the majority of sources selected in this manner are indeed ct .    if an infrared excess agn has @xmath70",
    "@xmath77 10@xmath49 erg @xmath7 s@xmath33 and @xmath98 @xmath3 550 @xmath0jy , than the agn is ct and located at @xmath1 @xmath77 2 .",
    "this is true for both the evolving and non - evolving models .",

    "it is therefore expected that x - ray stacking of ir bright sources with @xmath97 @xmath5 1000 and low soft x - ray flux will yield a large fraction of the @xmath1 @xmath77 2 high luminosity ct agn population .",

    "this suggests that the orientation based unified model works well for describing the local seyfert population , but may not be appropriate for the high redshift , high luminosity quasar population .",

    "<S> studying the average properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) host stellar populations is an important step in understanding the role of agn in galaxy evolution and the processes which trigger and fuel agn activity . </S>",
    "<S> here we calculate model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that include emission from the agn , the host galaxy stellar population , and dust enshrouded star formation . using the framework of cosmic x - ray background population synthesis modeling , the model agn hosts are constrained using optical ( b band ) and near infrared ( j band , 3.6 @xmath0 m , 5.7 @xmath0 m , 8.0 @xmath0 m , and 24 @xmath0 m ) luminosity functions and number counts . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that at @xmath1 @xmath2 1 , type 1 and type 2 agn hosts have similar stellar populations , in agreement with the orientation based unified model and indicative of secular evolution . at @xmath1 @xmath3 1 , type 2 agn hosts are intrinsically different from type 1 agn hosts , suggesting that the simple orientation based unified model does not hold at @xmath1 @xmath3 1 . </S>",
    "<S> also , it is found that if compton thick ( ct ) agn evolve like less obscured type 2 agn , then , on average , ct agn hosts are similar to type 2 agn hosts ; however , if ct obscuration is connected to an evolutionary stage of black hole growth , then ct agn hosts will also be in specific evolutionary stages . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength selection criteria of ct agn are discussed . </S>"
