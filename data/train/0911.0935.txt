    "bhs are expected to regulate the rate at which they accrete gas down to the scale on which they are gravitationally dominant .",
    "for example , gas flowing in through an accretion disk can become so hot that its thermal emission becomes energetically important .",
    "scattering of the photons emitted by the accreting matter by free electrons gives rise to the so - called eddington limit .",
    "if the accretion rate exceeds this limit , which is inversely proportional to the assumed radiative efficiency of the accretion disk , then the radiative force exceeds the gravitational attraction of the bh and the inflow is quenched , at least within the region that is optically thin to the radiation .",
    "however , observations indicate that the time - averaged accretion rate is far below eddington @xcite , suggesting the presence of processes acting on larger scales .",
    "indeed , the existence of tight correlations between the mass of the bh and the properties of the stellar bulge indicates that self - regulation may happen on the scale of the bulge ( @xmath3  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , far exceeding the radius within which the bh is gravitationally dominant .",
    "however , since galaxy - wide processes such as galaxy mergers can trigger gas flows into the bulge @xcite , it is conceivable that bhs could regulate their growth on the scale of the entire galaxy ( @xmath4  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or even on that of the dm haloes hosting the galaxies ( @xmath5  kpc ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , it is possible , perhaps even likely , that self - regulation takes place simultaneously on multiple scales .",
    "for example , frequent , short , eddington - limited outbursts may be able to regulate the inflow of gas on the scale of the bulge averaged over much longer time scales .    in this paper",
    "we investigate , using self - consistent simulations of the co - evolution of the bh and galaxy populations , on what scale the self - regulation of bhs takes place . in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] we demonstrate that bh self - regulation takes place on the scale of the dm halo , and that the bh mass is determined by the binding energy of the dm halo rather than by the stellar mass of the host galaxy . throughout we assume a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology with the cosmological parameters : @xmath7 , as determined from the wmap 3-year data @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a set of cosmological simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "we employ a significantly extended version of the parallel pmtree - sph code gadget iii ( last described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a lagrangian code used to calculate gravitational and hydrodynamic forces on a particle by particle basis .",
    "the initial particle positions and velocities are set at @xmath8 using the zeldovich approximation to linearly evolve positions from an initially glass - like state .",
    "in addition to hydrodynamic forces , we treat star formation , supernova feedback , radiative cooling , chemodynamics and black hole accretion and feedback , as described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter bs09 ) respectively . for clarity",
    "we summarize here the essential features of the bh model , which is itself a substantially modified version of that introduced by @xcite .",
    "seed bhs of mass @xmath9  where @xmath10 is the simulation gas particle mass  are placed into every dm halo that contains more than 100 dm particles and does not already contain a bh particle .",
    "haloes are identified by regularly running a friends - of - friends group finder on - the - fly during the simulation . after forming ,",
    "bhs grow by two processes : accretion of ambient gas and mergers .",
    "gas accretion occurs at the minimum of the eddington rate , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the proton mass , @xmath14 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath15 is the speed of light , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the sound speed and density of the local medium , @xmath18 is the velocity of the bh relative to the ambient medium , and @xmath19 is a dimensionless efficiency parameter",
    ". the parameter @xmath19 , which was set to 100 by @xcite , accounts for the fact that our simulations possess neither the necessary resolution nor the physics to accurately model accretion onto a bh on small scales .",
    "note that for @xmath20 this accretion rate reduces to the so called bondi - hoyle @xcite rate .",
    "as long as we resolve the scales and physics relevant to bondi - hoyle accretion , we could set @xmath20 .",
    "if a simulation resolves the jeans scales in the accreting gas then it will also resolve the scales relevant for bondi - hoyle accretion onto any bh larger than the simulation mass resolution ( bs09 ) .",
    "we therefore generally set @xmath19 equal to unity .",
    "however , this argument breaks down in the presence of a multi - phase interstellar medium , because our simulations do not resolve the properties of the cold , molecular phase , and as such the accretion rate may be orders of magnitude higher than the bondi - hoyle rate predicted by our simulations for star - forming gas .",
    "we therefore use a power - law scaling of the accretion efficiency such that @xmath21 in star - forming gas , where @xmath22 is the critical density for the formation of a cold , star - forming gas phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is a free parameter in our simulations .",
    "we set @xmath24 , but note that the results shown here are insensitive to changes in this parameter when @xmath25 ( see bs09 ) , because in that case the growth of the bhs is limited by feedback .",
    "energy feedback is implemented by allowing bhs to inject a fixed fraction of the rest mass energy of the gas they accrete into the surrounding medium .",
    "the energy deposition rate is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radiative efficiency of the bh , @xmath28 is the rate at which the bh is accreting gas , and @xmath29 is the rate of bh mass growth .",
    "we set @xmath27 to be 0.1 , the mean value for radiatively efficient accretion onto a schwarzschild bh @xcite .",
    "we vary @xmath30 but use @xmath31 as our fiducial value .",
    "it was shown in bs09 that , for @xmath31 , simulations identical to these reproduce the observed redshift zero @xmath32 and @xmath33 relations , where @xmath34 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the stars and @xmath35 is the galaxy stellar mass .",
    "energy is returned to the surroundings of the bh thermally , that is , by increasing the temperature of @xmath36 of the bh s neighbouring sph particles by at least @xmath37 .",
    "a bh performs no heating until it has built up enough of an energy reservoir to heat by this amount .",
    "the use of an energy reservoir is necessary in these simulations as otherwise gas will be able to radiate away the energy every timestep .",
    "imposing a minimum temperature increase ensures that the radiative cooling time is sufficiently long for the feedback to be effective . in our fiducial model we set @xmath38 and @xmath39k but",
    "the results are insensitive to the exact values of these parameters ( see bs09 ) .",

    "it is instructive to first consider under what conditions bhs can regulate their growth . to regulate its growth on a mass scale @xmath46",
    ", a bh of mass @xmath0 must be able to inject energy ( or momentum ) at a rate that is sufficient to counteract the force of gravity on the scale @xmath46 , averaged over the dynamical time associated with this scale .",
    "the mass @xmath46 could , for example , correspond to that of the bh , the stellar bulge , or the dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "if the bh can not inject energy sufficiently rapidly , then gravity will win and its mass will increase .",
    "provided that the maximum rate at which it can inject energy increases with @xmath0 ( as is for example the case for bondi - hoyle and eddington - limited accretion with a constant radiative efficiency ) and provided that this rate increases sufficiently rapidly to counteract the growth of @xmath46 , the bh will ultimately reach the critical mass @xmath47 required to halt the inflow on the scale @xmath46 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath48 , then the bh will quickly quench the accretion flow and its mass will consequently remain nearly unchanged .",
    "the bh will in that case return to the equilibrium value @xmath47 on the time scale which characterises the growth of @xmath46 .    if the bh regulates its growth on the mass scale @xmath46 and if @xmath49 , then the critical rate of energy injection required for self - regulation is independent of the mass of the bh .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : edot ] that @xmath50 , which implies @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the initial mass of the bh .",
    "hence , if the self - gravity of bhs is negligible on the maximum scale on which they regulate their growth and if @xmath53 , then we expect @xmath54 .    predicted redshift zero global bh mass density ( black diamonds ) and normalization of the @xmath33 relation ( black plus signs ) as a function of the assumed efficiency of bh feedback , @xmath30 .",
    "both quantities are normalized to their values in the simulation with @xmath31 , which reproduces the observed relations between the mass of the bh and properties of the stellar bulge .",
    "each point represents a different simulation . for @xmath55",
    "all data points track the dotted black line , which is a power - law with index minus one .",
    "this implies that in this regime bh mass is inversely proportional to @xmath0 , and thus that the bhs inject energy into their surroundings at a rate that is independent of @xmath30 , as expected for self - regulated growth on scales that are sufficiently large for the gravity of the bh to be unimportant .",
    "the red data points show results from simulations with a mass resolution that is 8 times worse than the fiducial simulation .",
    "the blue data points correspond to simulations with 64 times better resolution than our fiducial resolution , but show results for redshift 2 rather than zero .",
    "the agreement between the black , red and blue points confirms numerical convergence and demonstrates that the bhs are already self - regulating at redshift 2.,width=313 ]        the black diamonds plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : massscale ] show the predicted global mass density in bhs at redshift zero as a function of @xmath30 , the efficiency with which bhs couple energy into the ism , normalised to the density obtained for @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , the black plus signs indicate the normalisation of the @xmath33 relation divided by that for the @xmath31 run .",
    "the feedback efficiency , @xmath30 , is varied , in factors of 4 , from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , which implies that the fraction of the accreted rest mass energy that is injected ( i.e.  @xmath58 ) varies from @xmath59 to 0.96 .",
    "bh mass is clearly inversely proportional to the assumed feedback efficiency for @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 the trend breaks down because the bh masses remain similar to the assumed seed mass , in accord with eq .",
    "[ eq : prop ] .",
    "if we had used a lower seed mass , then the trend would have extended to greater values of @xmath30 .",
    "the deviation from inverse proportionality that sets in below @xmath62 is more interesting .",
    "such low values yield bh masses that are more than @xmath63 times greater than observed , in which case they are no longer negligible compared to the masses of their host galaxies . in that case the critical rate of energy deposition will no longer be independent of @xmath0 and we do not expect eq .",
    "[ eq : prop ] to hold .",
    "we have thus confirmed that feedback enables bhs to regulate their growth .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that this self - regulation takes places on scales over which the gravitational influence of the bhs is negligible , provided that the fraction of the accreted rest mass energy that is coupled back into the interstellar medium is @xmath64 .    to test whether it is the stellar or the dark matter distribution that determines the mass of bhs",
    ", we compare the bh masses in two simulations that are identical except for the assumed efficiency of star formation .",
    "one uses our fiducial star formation law , but in the other simulation we reduced its amplitude by a factor of 100 , making the gas consumption time scale much longer than the age of the universe . because changing the amount of stars would imply changing the rate of injection of supernova energy , which could affect the efficiency of bh feedback , we neglected feedback from star formation in both runs . in the simulation with normal  star formation",
    "the central regions of the galaxies are dominated gravitationally by the baryonic component of the galaxy , whereas in the simulation with reduced star formation the dm dominates everywhere .",
    "[ fig : changing_baryons ] shows the @xmath65 and @xmath32 relations at redshift 0 .",
    "while the two runs produce nearly identical bh masses for a fixed halo mass , the @xmath32 relation is shifted to lower stellar masses by more than an order of magnitude in the model with reduced star formation .",
    "the insensitivity of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath66 to the assumed star formation efficiency demonstrates that the bh mass is not set by the gravitational potential on the scale of the galaxy .",
    "we have verified that the same result holds at redshift two for the simulations with 64 times better mass resolution .",
    "clearly , stellar mass does not significantly influence the relation between the mass of the bh and that of its host halo .",
    "this implies that bh self - regulation occurs on the scale of dm haloes .",
    "if the rate by which the bhs inject energy is independent of the assumed feedback efficiency , then we expect the same to be true for the factor by which bh feedback suppresses star formation .",
    "this is confirmed by comparison of the global sfrs in runs with different values of @xmath30 ( see fig .",

    "fig : mhalombh ] compares the predicted @xmath69 relation with observation @xcite .",
    "the agreement is striking .",
    "the slope and normalization of the observed @xmath70 relation are @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , whereas the simulation predicts @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "note that the simulation was only tuned to match the normalization of the relations between @xmath0 and the galaxy stellar properties .",
    "if the energy injected by a bh is proportional to the halo gravitational binding energy , then , for isothermal models @xcite , @xmath75 . here",
    "we extend these models to the more realistic universal halo density profile @xcite , whose shape is specified by a concentration parameter , @xmath15 ( we assumed @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the maximum halo circular velocity and the circular velocity at the virial radius respectively ) . it is known that concentration decreases with increasing halo mass , @xmath79 @xcite , which then affects bh mass through the dependence of halo binding energy on concentration .",
    "if the total energy injected by a bh of a given mass is proportional to the energy required to unbind gas from a dm halo @xcite out to some fraction of the virial radius , @xmath80 then @xmath81 inserting @xmath82 and computing the logarithmic derivative with respect to @xmath83 in the mass range @xmath84 , we find that the slope is a weak function of @xmath80 that varies from 1.50 at @xmath85 to 1.61 at @xmath86 .",
    "the close match between theory , simulation and observation suggests that the halo binding energy , rather than halo mass , determines the mass of the bh .",
    "the residuals from the @xmath65 relation ( @xmath87 ) are correlated with halo concentration ( spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath88 , probability of significance @xmath89 ) as would be expected if @xmath0 is sensitive to the halo binding energy .",
    "the residuals are also correlated with galaxy stellar mass , though much less strongly ( @xmath90 ; @xmath91 ) .",
    "taken together , these correlations tell us that , at a given halo mass , galaxies with bhs more massive than the average will also contain a larger than average amount of stars , and are hosted by more concentrated haloes .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy stellar mass is also determined by the halo binding energy .",
    "thus , outliers in the @xmath65 relation may still lie close to the mean @xmath32 relation .",
    "furthermore , higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and spheroidal components do indeed typically host old stellar populations .",
    "in addition to the quasar mode  of feedback discussed in this work , it has recently become clear that a second radio mode  may be required to quench cooling flows in galaxy groups and clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "although we do not explicitly include a radio mode  in the current work , the agn feedback prescription explored here is capable of suppressing cooling flows , at least on group scales , providing excellent matches to observed group density and temperature profiles as well as galaxy stellar masses and age distributions @xcite .",
    "it is known that bhs obtain most of their mass in the quasar mode  @xcite so any discussion of what detemines the masses of bhs must focus primarily on this mode of accretion . finally , the ability of a bh to quench cooling flows in the radio mode  is expected to be closely related the virial properties of the hot halo @xcite and would therefore provide an additional link between bhs and dm haloes over and above what we discuss here and so serve to make any fundamental connection between bh mass and the properties of the dm halo even stronger .",
    "we conclude that our simulation results suggest that in order to effectively halt bh ( and galaxy ) growth , gas must not return to the galaxy on a short timescale .",
    "this requires that the bh injects enough energy to eject gas out to scales where the dm halo potential is dominant .",
    "the mass of the bh is therefore determined primarily by the mass of the dm halo with a secondary dependence on halo concentration , of the form that would be expected if the bh mass were controlled by the halo binding energy .",
    "the tight correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath35 is then a consequence of the more fundamental relations between halo binding energy and both @xmath0 and @xmath35 .",
