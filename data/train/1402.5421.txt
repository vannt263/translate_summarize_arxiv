    "<S> here we discuss an alternative approach to the testing of quantum collapse models that , by bypassing the need for the preparation of quantum superposition states might help us addressing non - linear stochastic mechanisms such as the one at the basis of the continuous spontaneous localisation model .    </S>",
    "<S> there is clearly a growing consensus that macroscopic tests of quantum theory are one of the most promising ways to explore the boundaries between classical and quantum framework with the scope of characterising the quantum - to - classical transition . </S>",

    "<S> the vast majority of the proposals for the test of cms put forward so far is based on interferometric approaches in which massive systems are prepared in large spatial quantum superposition states . in order for such tests to be effective </S>",
    "<S> , the superposition has to be sufficiently stable in time to allow for the performance of the necessary measurements . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , these are extremely demanding requirements from a practical viewpoint . </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , the experimental state - of - the - art is still far from allowing for a conclusive test . </S>",

    "<S> . a way forward would be the continued technical improvement of such experimental setups , aimed at reaching suited working points . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one might adopt a radically different approach and think of non - interferometric strategies to achieve the goal of a successful test . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore one such possibility . </S>",
    "<S> we show that cms ( in general , any nonlinear effect on quantum systems ) modify the spectrum of light interacting with a radiation pressure - driven mechanical oscillator in a cavity optomechanics setting in a way that could be revealed in a simple and effective way . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we demonstrate that the csl - affected dynamics of the mechanical oscillator results in an additional broadening term on the noise spectrum of the light driving the oscillator . under suitable conditions , such extra </S>",
    "<S> broadening can be pin - pointed to gather information on the non - linear effect due , for instance , to a collapse mechanism . by bypassing the necessity of preparing , manipulating , and sustaining the quantum superposition state of a massive object </S>",

    "<S> the pump populates a mode of the cavity filed that is coupled to a vibrating mirror ( frequency @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) and a polarising beam - splitter ( pbs ) are used to re - direct the light leaking from the cavity after the interaction with mechanical mirror , which is affected by both radiation - pressure and the non - linear mechanism responsible for csl , to a spectrum analyser . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we assume a non - linear mechanism to act on the oscillator , as described by a suitable cm . the setup is illustrated schematically in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ start ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now have all the ingredients to write explicitly as a set of quantum langevin equations reading  @xcite @xmath39 where we have introduced the cavity input noise operator @xmath40 , the brownian - motion langevin operator @xmath41 ( describing the incoherent motion of the mechanical mirror arising from the coupling with the background of phononic modes due to its physical support ) . </S>",

    "<S> this set of equations is in general very difficult to solve due to the non - linear nature of the optomechanical coupling ( see very recent progress towards the treatment of the full non - linear process in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , under the assumption of large pumping ( i.e. large input power of the driving field ) , we can expand the field and mirror operators in fluctuations around their respective mean values @xmath46 as @xmath47 with @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state mean values can be easily determined and used to derive a simplified set of equations for the fluctuation operators that can be solved in frequency space  @xcite . leaving the details of an otherwise straightforward calculation aside , we can focus on the form of the symmetrized two - frequency correlation function @xmath49 , which embodies the dns of the mirror s position . by assuming markovianity of the mechanical brownian motion , which justified in the limit of moderate temperature and small mechanical damping , we get    @xmath50[{\\gamma_m } \\coth\\left(\\beta\\omega\\right)+\\lambda]}{\\left|2\\alpha_s^2 \\delta   \\hbar \\chi ^2+m \\left(\\omega ^2-\\omega_m^2-i\\gamma_m \\omega \\right ) \\left[\\delta ^2+(\\kappa + i \\omega)^2\\right]\\right|^2}\\ ] ]    with @xmath51 , @xmath52 the cavity - pump detuning , and @xmath53 being the steady - state amplitude of the cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  ( [ eq : s_w ] ) is the key formal result of this analysis and the focus of the analysis that we will present in the remainder of this work . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that an alternative approach to the calculations presented here would be the explicit modification of the two - time correlator @xmath54 in eq .   with the replacement @xmath55 and </S>",
    "<S> the markov approximation for the mechanical brownian motion .    * ( a)*7.5cm*(b ) *     _ discussion. _ clearly , the csl mechanism manifests itself in the dns as an addition to the thermal contribution embodied by @xmath56 [ cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus immediate to realise that in order to magnify the effect due to the csl up to the point of making it observable , we should deplete the thermal contributions to the dns . </S>",
    "<S> this requires a low initial temperature of the mechanical mirror and , possibly , the use of an additional radiation pressure - based passive cooling mechanisms that brings the mechanical system in equilibrium at a lower temperature than that of its surrounding bath . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to assuming that the mirror is in a thermal state at a low effective temperature @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by arranging for a large detuning @xmath57 , we can achieve conditions such that the alleged csl mechanisms is actually key in determining the steady - state conditions of the mechanical mirror . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , from the expression above , and using the definitions of the parameters entering @xmath58 , one can see that @xmath59 needless to say , the situation is not achievable in actual experiments , where only a finite detuning and a non - zero temperature are achievable in practice . however , as we will see , this dos not preclude , in principle , the observable nature of the csl effects .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dns ] * ( a ) * , for instance , we compare the dns of the mechanical mirror with and without csl effects at a moderately large detuning and for values of the key parameters that are not far from experimental realizability . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , by acting like an additional term to the natural thermal broadening of the noise spectrum of the mirror , the csl mechanisms results in a wider @xmath58 and does not affect the peak position of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that an effective way to determine it quantitatively would be to calculate the area underneath the spectrum , thus inferring the modification that such additional term induces on the average energy of the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus considered the quantity @xmath60 which gives us a quantitative estimate of the relative increase of the area under the dns for @xmath61 with respect to the case of no csl mechanism . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dns ] * ( b ) * we show the behavior of such a figure of merit against the value of @xmath62 , calculated using the parameter @xmath63 ( which is much larger than the estimate provided by ghirardi , pearle and rimini , and thus offers more chances of being actually observed ) , and for some choices of the detuning : at large detunings , @xmath64 appears to be a linear function of @xmath62 and for @xmath65 ( we notice that we work in the bad - cavity regime , which is much easier to achieve , experimentally ) , and the csl mechanism could result in a sizeable increase of the dns area . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , the actual value by which such area increases strongly depends on the set of parameters that are used to model the dynamics of the system and by no means we claim for optimality . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning , finally , that as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and experimentally demonstrated in many optomechanics experiments , the light leaking out of the cavity can be used to reconstruct the spectrum of the intra - cavity mechanical mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the use of standard input - output relations @xmath66 , linking the extra - cavity field to the input noise and the intra - cavity signal , shows that the same signatures of the csl mechanism persist in the extra - cavity signal , which can be effectively used to infer the value of @xmath62 and , from this , the characteristic parameter @xmath2 of the csl model . </S>",
    "<S> details of this analysis are provided in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions._ our analysis supports the idea that the effects of non - linear stochastic modifications to quantum mechanics , such as those that characterize the csl model , are observable by adopting an indirect approach that does not rely on the ad hoc creation of a quantum superposition state . </S>",
    "<S> we have illustrated such a possibility using a cavity optomechanics setting where the noise properties of the field leaking from a fabry - perot cavity with a vibrating end mirror carry information on potential influences due to collapse - like mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal appears to only require low operating temperatures of the mechanical mirror , a condition that is met in most of the cutting - edge experiments in cavity optomechanics reported so far  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , although we have focused our discussion to the end - mirror configuration of an optomechanical setup , it is clearly perfectly suited to be adapted to both membrane - in - the - middle and levitating - nanosphere configurations , therefore embodying a general paradigm of vast appeal .    _ </S>",
