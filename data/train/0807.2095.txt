    "in this paper , we will answer a question posed by hisham sati about the low dimensional string bordism groups of spaces of particular interest to string theorists .",

    "this computation generalizes computations of stong of the spin bordism groups of @xmath2 and of edwards of the spin bordism of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we see that the string bordism of @xmath2 injects into the spin bordism of @xmath2 through dimension at least @xmath6 .",
    "this means that many of the cohomological invariants used to detect bordism classes of spin manifolds apply equally well here . in particular , the comparison of adams spectral sequences used to compute the @xmath7 string bordism group of @xmath3 shows that the landweber - stong invariant detects this string bordism class @xcite .",

    "our actual computation will be of the @xmath9-homology of @xmath2 .",
    "we proceed in this section to explain why this computation is sufficient .",

    "this is an @xmath11 ring map @xmath12 that refines the witten genus @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-orientation is @xmath8-connected .",
    "we argue this locally , showing that it is true at @xmath13 , at @xmath14 , and with @xmath15 inverted .    for @xmath16",

    "combined with the previous theorem , we conclude the following .    as graded rings , @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where the isomorphism is the composite of the postnikov section with the @xmath10-orientation .",
