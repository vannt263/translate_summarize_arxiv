    "in this paper we establish some properties of near - symplectic forms , as defined in @xcite :    a two - form @xmath1 on an oriented four - manifold @xmath2 is called _ near - positive _ if at each point @xmath3 , either ( i ) @xmath4 , or ( ii ) @xmath5 and the intrinsic gradient @xmath6 has rank 3 as a linear map .",
    "it is _ near - symplectic _ if , in addition , @xmath7 .",
    "to clarify : at a point where @xmath5 , there is an intrinsic gradient @xmath8 in the direction @xmath9 , for any @xmath10 , because @xmath11 is a zero of a smooth section of a vector bundle . if @xmath12 in a neighbourhood of @xmath11 then @xmath13 for all @xmath10 .",
    "the wedge - square quadratic form @xmath14 , which is defined up to a positive scalar , has signature @xmath15 , so to say that @xmath16 has rank 3 is to say that its image is a maximal positive - definite subspace for the wedge - square form .",
    "the zero - set @xmath17 of a near - positive form @xmath18 is a smooth @xmath19-dimensional submanifold .",

    "moreover , @xmath31 for @xmath32 , so @xmath1 is constant along @xmath33 ; hence @xmath34 .    a smooth path of two - forms @xmath35}$ ] can be regarded as a section @xmath36 of the pullback of the vector bundle @xmath37 to @xmath38 \\times x$ ] .",

    "when @xmath45 and @xmath46 are near - symplectic , the zero - set @xmath47 } { \\{t\\}\\times z_{\\omega_t}}$ ] of the cobordism @xmath36 is a smooth surface in @xmath38 \\times x$ ] , realising a cobordism between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    in this article",
    "we prove the following :    [ main ] suppose that the connected , oriented four - manifold @xmath2 carries a near - symplectic form @xmath45 whose zero - set has @xmath50 components , where @xmath51",

    ", the zero - surface @xmath56 of the cobordism realises an elementary cobordism between the zero - sets of @xmath45 and @xmath46 : the projection @xmath57 $ ] is a morse function with just one critical point , of index 1 .",
    "the proof given here is elementary  it relies on stability arguments _  la _ moser .",
    "we shall show that given any pair of disjoint arcs embedded in the zero - set of @xmath45 , and a path in @xmath2 connecting interior points of these arcs , one can find a near - symplectic cobordism whose zero - surface is the result of attaching a ( 2-dimensional ) 1-handle to the pair of arcs so that the core of the handle is the chosen path .",
    "thus , given arcs on two distinct components of the zero - set , one can join them up to make a single component . on the other hand , taking the arcs to to be on the same component , the surgery increases by one the number of components .",
    "a statement similar to theorem [ main ] is mentioned in taubes 1998 icm lecture @xcite , with attribution to unpublished work of karl luttinger .",
    "after i had written a draft of the present article , taubes sent me a preprint , which has now appeared as @xcite , in which he also shows that the number of zero - circles can be increased or decreased by a local modification .",
    "his approach also uses 1-handle addition , but aside from that it is different .",
    "it does not proceed through an evolution of the forms , and so does not include the cobordism statement , but rather through a ` mutation ' in which one removes a ball whose intersection with the zero - set is a pair of arcs , then invokes eliashberg s classification of overtwisted contact structures to argue that it can be glued back so that the ends of the arcs match up differently .",
    "taubes also proves by means of a ` birth ' model that any near - symplectic form is near - symplectically cobordant to one with one more zero - circle .    as a simpler variant",
    ", one can deduce the following weaker statement from a result of calabi :    let @xmath1 be a near - symplectic form on an oriented four - manifold whose zero - set has @xmath58 components . then there is a near - symplectic form whose zero - set has @xmath59 components and which coincides with @xmath1 outside an embedded ball .",
    "we consider near - symplectic forms @xmath60 on @xmath61 which arise from functions @xmath62 and metrics @xmath63 on @xmath64 which coincide with the euclidean metric @xmath65 outside a compact set : @xmath66 the two - form @xmath60 is closed if and only if @xmath67 is @xmath63-coclosed .",
    "if @xmath68 is morse then @xmath60 is near - positive , and its zero - circles are in bijection with the critical points .",
    "for example , when @xmath69 we recover standard symplectic @xmath70 : @xmath71 .    in @xcite",
    ", calabi gives a recognition criterion for a closed one - form to be coclosed with respect to _ some _ metric .",
    "as an example , he shows that one can start with the function @xmath72 and modify it to a function @xmath73 which coincides with @xmath73 outside a closed ball of chosen radius @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 is @xmath76-coclosed for some @xmath76 standard outside the @xmath74-ball .    by darboux s theorem , there exists @xmath77 such that the open ball @xmath78 of radius @xmath79 , with its symplectic form @xmath80 , embeds into our near - symplectic manifold .",
    "we can then plug in @xmath81 in place of @xmath80 , which has the effect of increasing by two the number of zero - circles .",
    "when @xmath2 is closed , connected , and not negative - definite , there are near - symplectic forms with arbitrary positive numbers of zero - circles .",
    "the existence of a near - symplectic form in this situation is well - known , and can be proved either using hodge theory as in @xcite  an argument which originated in the 1980s  or via handle decompositions and the flexibility of overtwisted contact structures @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath46 be two near - symplectic forms on a closed manifold @xmath2 .",
    "assuming either that @xmath82 , or that they represent the same cohomology class , these forms are near - symplectically cobordant ( in @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) by the work of honda ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 2.24 ) .",
    "when @xmath45 and @xmath46 are symplectic , the zero - set of a cobordism projects to an orientable surface in @xmath2 whose homology class is presumably determined by @xmath85 . supposing this vanishes , one can ask whether there are constraints on the topology of the surface , or on the function on it defined by the @xmath86-coordinate of the cobordism . for example , when a three - manifold @xmath87 fibres over @xmath88 , there is a standard construction of a symplectic form on @xmath89 .",
    "given two possibly inequivalent fibrations on @xmath87 , representing the same class in @xmath90 and having the same euler class in @xmath91 , it is not clear whether the associated symplectic forms need be deformation - equivalent .",
    "one could try first to use morse theory on @xmath87 to construct a near - symplectic cobordism between them whose zero - set is a union of product tori , and then to attempt to modify this cobordism so that its zero - set becomes empty .",

    "one of these bundles has rank 1 .",
    "a component of @xmath96 over which this line bundle is topologically trivial is called ` even ' ; one for which it is non - trivial is called ` odd ' .",
