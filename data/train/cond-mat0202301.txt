    "it has been recognized that in the strongly correlated electronic systems both the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) and electron - electron ( el - el ) interaction are enhanced and play important roles . in manganites , the colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) @xcite has been discussed from both points of view . in this system",
    "the ferromagnetism is basically explained by the double exchange model.@xcite however the orbital degeneracy of the @xmath6-states is considered to be very important , and the orbital ordering or disordering is the crucial issue for the understanding of the cmr effect .",
    "@xcite therefore there are two viewpoints on this problem , namely the orbital degrees of freedom is governed by ( i ) the jahn - teller ( jt ) electron - phonon coupling or ( ii ) the electron correlation . in the former case ,",
    "the change of the bandwidth due to the crossover from small to large jt - polaron is the key mechanism of the cmr effect , and the jt effect is assumed to be negligible in the ferromagnetic metallic state .",
    "@xcite this picture appear contradicting with the orbital orderings , which require rather strong coupling , surrounding the ferromagnetic region in the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite however it might be the case that the metallic screening weakens the el - ph interaction and/or the el - el interaction , and only in the ferromagnetic metallic state both of them could be neglected although the hund s coupling is strong enough to polarize the spins perfectly . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been recognized by several authors @xcite that the coulomb interaction play the important role in the physics of the orbital degrees of freedom , and the jt - interaction is the secondary effect .    in this paper",
    "we revisited this issue by considering both the el - ph and el - el interaction , because both of them are considered to be relevant .",
    "then the interplay between these two interactions is the key issue . as shown below",
    ", the metallic screening of the jt el - ph interaction does not occur in contrast to the coupling between the breathing mode and the charge fluctuation .",
    "coulomb interaction and jt effect collaborate with each other , and it is concluded that jt effect is _ enhanced _ by the el - el interaction by comparing the two limits of zero and strong electron correlations . similar idea has been proposed by one of the authors @xcite in the context of the large-@xmath7 approximation @xcite , where the single site model embedded in the dymanical environment is considered @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "the effect of the jt phonon scattering with @xmath8 has not yet been exploited so much , and we found that the el - ph coupling which modulates the transfer integral becomes relevant in both limits of the non - interacting and the strong correlation limit .",
    "another important issue is how the el - ph intereaction manifests itself in the spin stiffness observed in neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "because of the half - metallicity , the stiffness is roughly proportional to the kinetic energy.@xcite the polaronic effect on the kinetic energy is therefore expected to appear as a reduction of the stiffness .",
    "the apparent absence of this reduction has led to the conclusion that el - ph interaction is irrelevant in the ferromagnetic metallic state .",
    "however we found that jt el - ph interaction is there even in the ferromagnetic state although it might be hidden in the inaccuracy of the theoretical estimation of the bare spin stiffness compared with the experimental ones .",
    "we expect near 3@xmath9 of the reduction of the kinetic energy and spin stiffness due to the jt interaction as a lower bound estimated in the non - interacting limit .",
    "we first consider the non - interacting electrons with orbital degeneracy with jt el - ph coupling .",
    "@xcite the single - band model where the charge density is coupled to the phonon can be treated by means of the canonical transformation , leading to the reduction of the kinetic energy via the debye - waller factor .",
    "@xcite this argument is applicable to the interaction with the breathing mode .",
    "however this method can not be generalized to the jt el - ph interaction with multiband electronic structure because it includes off - diagonal components with respect to orbital indices . due to this difficulty",
    ", it is hard to apply the same argument as the breathing mode case to clarify whether the jt polaron also leads to the reduction of the kinetic energy or not .",
    "therefore we employ the perturbative analysis on the jt el - ph coupling to estimate the reduction of the kinetic energy and spin stiffness .",
    "although many channels contribute , each of which can be even negative , the resultant reduction in the kinetic energy gain is roughly proportional to the density of states at the fermi energy , and has a peak at around @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the filling of the @xmath6 band .    next we consider the strong correlation limit by employing the effective lagrangian which is derived as a projection onto the polarized orbital state .",
    "@xcite in this limit , the magnitude of the orbital polarization has been saturated , and the only degrees of freedom coupled to the jt phonon is therefore the direction of the polarization ( which corresponds to the shape of the orbital ordering ) .",
    "the direction is determined by the double exchange interaction , which is of the order of the transfer integral , @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of the direction ( physically the fluctuation of the orbital shape ) is couples to the lattice deformation via the el - ph interaction , leading to the lattice relaxation energy @xmath14 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the jt el - ph coupling constant , the atomic mass , and the phonon frequency , respectively ) .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath15 of the orbital fluctuation is of the order of the transfer integral @xmath13 , and is larger than the phonon frequency @xmath4 .",
    "namely the orbital deformation can follow up the phonon , leading to the kinetic energy correction , @xmath16 .",
    "the phonon frequency ( @xmath4- ) dependence of the kinetic energy correction in this case , @xmath17\\sim o\\left(1\\right)$ ] , is different from that of non - interacting electrons case , @xmath18\\sim   \\left[\\left(\\omega / t_0\\right)/\\left(1+\\omega / t_0\\right)^2\\right]$ ] .",
    "thus the strong correlation enhances the jt effect , in sharp contrast to the case of breathing mode where the coulomb interaction reduces the el - ph interaction .",
    "this is understood rather easily . in the case of the breathing mode ,",
    "the coulomb interaction suppresses the charge fluctuation while the breathing mode induces it , i.e. , these two interactions compete with each other , and the former suppresses the latter . furthermore the metallic screening effect also suppresses the charge fluctuation ( this situation has been discussed in the context of the vertex correction of the el - ph interaction in the physics of high-@xmath19 cuprates @xcite ) . on the other hand , in the jt mode case , where el - el and el - ph interactions collaborate to induce the orbital pseudospin moment ,",
    "the former enhances the latter and vice versa .",
    "therefore there is no reason to expect the weakening of the jt el - ph interaction with the doping when the strong el - el interaction keeps the orbital pseudo - spin moment to saturate even in the ferromagneitc metallic state .",
    "the plan of this paper follows .",
