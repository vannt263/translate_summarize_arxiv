    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the representations of flavor symmetry @xmath19 , and contains the construction of yukawa interactions of sm charged leptons with @xmath22-even higgs contents . in section iii , two models with non - zero @xmath6 are presented .",
    "the first model obtains the pmns angle by a simple relation of tbm angles and the mixing angle @xmath23 of charged leptons . in the second model ,",
    "the transformation of neutrino mass matrix becomes the pmns matrix to the leading order .",
    "the predictions are examined in the figures .",
    "the conclusion section contains a summary and mentions some exclusion regions as the prediction , and an appendix is attached to describe the interactions of higgs fields and their vevs to make the potential minimum .",
    "the minimal non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath19 is the group of the permutation of the three sides of an equilateral triangle .",
    "there are six elements of the group in three classes , and their irreducible representations are @xmath24 and @xmath25 its character table is mentioned in many models @xcite .",
    "the clebsch - gordon coefficients in the real representations are given by the following product rules @xcite , @xmath26",
    ".group representation of sm particles [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , an abelian discrete symmetry @xmath22 is also adopted , which is the parity that distinguishes extra particles from the sm contents .",
    "the sm fields are assigned to representations of @xmath1 as listed in table i , where the su(2 ) representation and hypercharge of a field are denoted by the subscription ` @xmath27 ' of the gauge symmetry , and the @xmath19 representation and @xmath22 charge of the field are denoted by the subscription ` @xmath28 ' .",
    "although the @xmath22 charges of fields are presented in table i , @xmath22 symmetry does not affect the interactions among @xmath22-even sm fields .",
    "then , the lagrangian of yukawa couplings of the charged leptons and the higgs scalar doublet @xmath29 is @xmath30 where the su(2 ) fermion doublet @xmath31 is a flavor singlet but @xmath32 and @xmath33 belong to a doublet such as @xmath34 under @xmath19 .",

    "the higgs self potential is @xmath39 so that , after spontaneous su(2 ) symmetry breaking , three dirac mass matrices of the charged leptons from the yukawa couplings become @xmath40 it is shown that for the flavor model we can build a basis where the matrix of charged lepton masses is diagonal and @xmath41 , if only sm fields contribute to generate the dirac masses .",
    "it follows that the right mass hierarchy is obtained from additional yukawa couplings with additional scalar fields beyond the sm .",

    "if the masses of charged leptons were obtained by using the yukawa couplings in eq.([smlepton ] ) , the muon and tau lepton could have the same mass , @xmath54 . here , we introduce an additional contribution to the masses derived from the yukawa couplings with another higgs @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath55 while the yukawa couplings of quarks are protected from the non - sm additional higgs @xmath44 , since the flavor symmetry is leptonic so that all quarks are @xmath19 singlets and @xmath22-even .",

    "two models are presented to explain neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy and the mixing matrix .",
    "both models contain @xmath22-odd additional particles , which can be distinguished from @xmath22-even sm fields .",
    "the righthanded neutrinos are characterized by @xmath22 charge -1 and coupled with @xmath22-odd higgs fields , while the sm righthanded leptons are all assigned to the charge + 1 and coupled with @xmath22-even higgs fields .",
    "those additional higgs contents are @xmath80 the higgs potential which include the interactions of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is presented in eq.([potential_sigma ] ) .",
    "its minimum is obtained by the real vevs of the higgs fields , which are denoted as @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "as far as the mixing of neutrino mass matrix is concerned , one model generates tbm , and the other generates nonzero @xmath0 in the pmns matrix .",
    "both types of mixing matrices are derived in terms of the @xmath19 symmetry and its breaking mechanism by the vacuum expectation value(vev ) of an @xmath19-doublet scalar field .",
    "the field contents and their charge assignments in the two models are identical to each other except the flavor charges of the righthanded neutrinos .",
    "the operators for majorana masses have four external lines with an internal line , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "if the internal line is a heavy righthanded neutrino which has its ends coupled in a yukawa interaction , the process giving rise to low energy effective masses is equivalent to the seesaw mechanism . here",
    ", we describe the generation of neutrino masses while comparing the two models , the difference between which originated from the choice of group representations for the internal righthanded neutrinos .",
    "all additional fields beyond the sm , including righthanded neutrinos , are distinguished from the sm particles by @xmath22 parity .",
    "all the sm fields are @xmath22 even , so that the parity does not affect any interaction of sm particles .",
    "additional higgs scalars , @xmath85 and @xmath81 , and right - handed neutrinos , @xmath86 , all have @xmath22-odd quantum number . their representation under the gauge symmetry is @xmath87 , and their representations under the flavor symmetry are @xmath88 their yukawa interactions are as follows : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is redundant so that the same result can be obtained by just two righthanded neutrinos .",
    "but we keep the two identical singlets , @xmath91 and @xmath90 , for the comparison with other representation for them in another model .",
    "the couplings of @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be rephrased as @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the gauge singlets @xmath97 have majorana masses as in @xmath98 , while the @xmath91 and @xmath90 have a cross term such as @xmath99 . if majorana neutrinos @xmath97 are very heavy , any two yukawa couplings could be linked to each other as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the vertex @xmath100 or @xmath101 in figure 1 can correspond to any term in eq.([yukawatbm ] ) if the @xmath97 that is substituted into @xmath102 is the same for both vertices .",
    "then , an effective lagrangian is obtained by integrating out the internal heavy fermion @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 here , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the elements of mass matrix of singlet majorana neutrinos @xmath97 for @xmath106 . since @xmath107 and @xmath90 all belong to different representations , their yukawa coupling constants @xmath108 can be different and so can be their masses , @xmath104 .",
    "when the scalar fields obtain vevs by spontaneous breaking of @xmath19 symmetry , the above 5-dimensional interactions reduce to low - energy effective mass terms of light neutrinos @xmath109 .",
    "the symmetric matrix is @xmath110 and @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that all @xmath108 are 1 ; then the mass matrix in eq.([tbm ] ) has a simple pattern as follows : @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "the above matrix has a vanishing determinant , implying that one mass should be zero .",
    "the ratio of non - zero masses @xmath4 is @xmath116 .",
    "the type of mass hierarchy depends on the relative sizes of @xmath117 and @xmath118 and those of @xmath119 and @xmath120 . if @xmath121 , furthermore , the matrix in eq.([tbm_simple ] ) is exactly of the form that results from the tri - bi - maximal mixing : @xmath122 .",
    "even when the yukawa coupling constants , @xmath108 , are allowed to be different from each other , @xmath0 and one of the masses vanish .",
    "only the mass ratio @xmath4 is shifted to @xmath123 .",
    "the specific pattern described above was discussed further in a previous work @xcite .",
    "the pmns matrix @xmath124 is obtained by    @xmath125    where @xmath58 is the transformation of @xmath77 in eq.([masslepton ] ) that imbeds @xmath126 in eq.([tanslepton ] ) into the 1 - 3 block .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath124 is expressed in the standard parametrization , @xmath127    where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively . from the comparison of two expressions in eq.([pmnsproduct ] ) and eq.([standard ] ) , the three angles in pmns matrix are obtained by the following simple relations , @xmath132 where @xmath133 in eq.([pmnsproduct ] ) and @xmath134 in eq.([standard ] ) .",

    "another predicted result is that @xmath138 belongs to the second octant .",
    "however , the range of @xmath139 predicted from the given @xmath23 is barely overlapped with the @xmath140 range of @xmath139 in the global analysis . a narrow range of @xmath135 , @xmath141 ,",
    "can generate simultaneously the angles @xmath142 and @xmath143 marginally allowed in experiment , of which the eligibility is about to be tested by a higher precision data of the current oscillation experiments @xcite .      when the @xmath144 is very small as considered in eq.([diagmm ] )",
    ", i.e. , when @xmath58 is almost the unit , the pmns matrix can be simply the transformation of neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the two righthanded neutrinos are in a doublet so they are not distinguishable in terms of flavor symmetry .",
    "the majorana neutrinos @xmath91 and @xmath90 are tied into @xmath145 , a two - dimensional representation of @xmath19 , so that @xmath146 . the scalar particles and @xmath147 do not change their charges , and all non - sm particles have @xmath22-odd quantum number .",
    "the group representations of particles are summarized as follows : @xmath148 the higgs potential is the same as the one for model a in eq.([potentialnh ] ) .",
    "the yukawa interactions are @xmath149 the couplings of @xmath150 and @xmath93 can be rephrased as @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "the majorana masses of the righthanded neutrinos are given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 becomes @xmath157 according to the product rule in eq.([prod3 ] ) , and breaking of @xmath19 gives rise to a common mass @xmath158 for @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "for the same reason , the neutrinos have common yukawa coupling constants @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "for very heavy majorana neutrinos , any two yukawa couplings can link to each other , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the interactions in figure 1 can be considered as non - renomalizable 5 dimensional couplings obtained by integrating out the internal fermions @xmath97 .",
    "then the effective lagrangian is given by    @xmath161    where @xmath104 are the heavy masses of singlet majorana neutrinos @xmath97 for @xmath106 .",
    "when the scalar fields obtain vevs by spontaneous breaking of @xmath19 symmetry as shown in eq.([first_der])-eq.([second_der ] ) , the above 5-dimensional interactions reduce to low - energy effective mass terms of light neutrinos @xmath109 .",
    "the matrix is @xmath162    where @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "for the simplest analysis , it is assumed that all @xmath165 s are one except @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath166 is smaller than 1 to make @xmath167 smaller than @xmath168 .",
    "a rather tedious estimation of masses and mixing angles from the above mass matrix is presented using pictorial analysis .",
    "fig.2 presents the possible parametric plots that can arise from eq.([t2kmass ] ) in spaces of @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath166 is chosen as 0.7 in the following example .",
    "five curves in each figure represent the choices of @xmath172 as 0.0001 , 0.1 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 by thick solid , dashed , dotted , dot - dashed , and thin solid lines , respectively . four circles on each curve represent the choices of @xmath173 as 0.07 , 0.17 , 0.27 , and 0.37 as @xmath5 increases .",
    "the horizontal shadow in each figure represents the allowed region at the 90% cl for the physical parameters according to the current experimental results : @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 . as for the mass ratio ,",
    "the region above 0.201 is not ruled out since @xmath177 can be larger than @xmath178 .",
    "for @xmath5 , two bounded regions are presented .",
    "one is @xmath179 from reno @xcite , which is indicated by brown stripes .",
    "the other is @xmath180 from daya bay @xcite , which is indicated by gray shadows .",
    "the bundle of curves in figure 2 shows the area that the model can cover as @xmath181 increases .",
    "different curves in a figure come from the relative ratio of the vevs of non - sm higgs fields .",
    "the construction of mass matrix does not derive coefficients of elements , leaving them free parameters , when the symmetry builds up a pattern of a mass matrix based on the charge assignments of a flavor symmetry .",
    "here , we examine the prediction from the model , while the effect of yukawa couplings , @xmath108 or @xmath165 , is suppressed by setting them one . whatever the value of @xmath181 is and whatever the ratio @xmath182 is , there is some area in @xmath183 , which is larger than 0.707 , excluded by the prediction .    as for @xmath4 , likewise , the mass type of degeneracy or quasi - degeneracy is ruled out .",
    "the thin solid line in each figure describes the fit for @xmath184 , and figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) show that the resulted curves miss the allowed range , if @xmath185 .",
    "so the mass ratio range is confined within @xmath186 at most .    on the other hand , the ranges of @xmath181 and @xmath182",
    "are also trimmed off by the experimental bounds of mixing angles .",
    "for instance , if @xmath187 , any value of @xmath181 smaller than 0.17 and that larger than 0.40 are excluded by reno bound on @xmath0 .",
    "the recent measurements of @xmath188 motivate an idea which is that non - zero @xmath5 is generated by a mechanism based on the symmetrical background rather than being a perturbation effect from tbm with @xmath18 .",
    "two lepton models were introduced in terms of @xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "one provides tbm from @xmath59 and non - zero @xmath0 from @xmath58 to the pmns matrix , while the other provides all leading orders of mixing angles from the neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath59 .",
    "the difference between two models is caused by the only difference between the flavor charge assignments for righthanded neutrinos .",
    "other group theoretical properties are all the same for both models .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetry splits the field contents into the particle fields beyond the sm and the fields in the sm , whether the charge is -1 or + 1 .",
    "since the sm fields are @xmath22-even , the yukawa couplings of the sm fermions are protected from the coupling with a @xmath22-odd scalar field . on the other hand , a @xmath22-odd righthanded neutrino makes a vertex with a @xmath22-odd scalar field .",
    "if a righthanded neutrino as an internal line is integrated out and the effective 5-dimensional coupling is suppressed by the mass scale of the righthanded neutrino , the majorana masses of lefthanded neutrinos become then light . the @xmath22-even scalar higgs fields , @xmath29 and @xmath44 , in yukawa couplings contribute to the masses of charged leptons , and @xmath22-odd scalar higgs fields , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in effective 5-dimensional couplings contribute to the masses of neutrinos .",
    "depending on the flavor charges of @xmath91 and @xmath90 among three generations , the type of neutrino mixing was determined .",
    "when they belong to separate @xmath189 representations , the model gave rise to the exact @xmath190 , as shown in eq.([tbm_simple ] ) .",
    "when they belong to a single @xmath191 representation , the model gave rise to @xmath192 unless @xmath193 .",
    "the prediction of the model , neglecting the contributions from most @xmath165 , was studied in fig.2 .",
    "the results obtained for various ranges of the relative ratio , @xmath194 , of majorana masses and for those of the relative scales of vevs of non - sm higgs , @xmath195 , rule out the area of @xmath183 larger than 0.707 and the mass pattern of ( quasi- ) degeneracy .",
    "thus , the survival of model b can be determined , depending on whether @xmath196 and whether the mass type is hierarchical .",
    "this work was supported by the basic science research program through nrf(2011 - 0014686 ) .",
    "the contents of higgs scalar particles and their representations under @xmath1 are @xmath197 which commonly belong to @xmath198 under @xmath199 gauge group .",
    "the full invariant higgs potential can be organized into three parts as follows : @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the interactions of only @xmath22-even particles and those of only @xmath22-odd particles , respectively , while @xmath203 is the cross interactions of @xmath22-even and @xmath22-odd particles .",
    "each contribution to the potential @xmath204 is given as ;      the subscript ` 1 ' or ` 2 ' in each term indicates that the product of two fields belongs to the representation @xmath206 or @xmath21 in @xmath19 . each term with a subscript ` @xmath207 ' consists of three types of products , @xmath208 and @xmath21 representations as in eq.([3reps ] ) .    according to the product rules in eqs .",
    "( [ prod1 ] ) - ( [ prod3 ] ) , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 . the higgs potential in eq.([potentialnh ] ) can be rephrased in terms of component fields @xmath211 with @xmath212 and 2 , and @xmath213 :                where @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the @xmath226 are rather complicated polynomials of @xmath227 and @xmath228 in eq.([potential_ext ] ) , such that @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "their details are not necessary for the following examination of the minimal condition .",
    "the first derivatives of the full potential given in eq.([3potential ] ) are      where each @xmath62 denotes the part that corresponds to the coefficients of linear terms .",
    "the vevs , @xmath232 and @xmath233 , can make the potential minimum , when the following conditions are satisfied .",
    "@xmath234 @xmath235 it is clear that any of @xmath236 and @xmath237 should not be zero to satisfy the above conditions . according to the symmetry of the potential under the interchange of @xmath238 and @xmath239 , vevs can be taken as @xmath240 .",
    "thus , in summary , the following vevs of the fields in eq.([4higgs ] ) can be adopted for the masses of leptons : @xmath241 then , the derivatives in eqs.([6min ] ) reduces to the following conditions :      according to eq.([first_der ] ) and eq.([second_der ] ) , @xmath243 and @xmath244 are necessary .",
    "the mass matrices are examined upon the assumptions of @xmath245 and @xmath246 with weak hierarchy .",
    "the assumptions do not show any conflicts with either the minimum conditions in eq.([4min ] ) or the phenomenological constraints , @xmath247 , since the constraints on masses and vevs contain a sufficient number of independent parameters .",

    "<S> this work proposes two models of neutrino masses that predict non - zero @xmath0 under the non - abelian discrete flavor symmetry @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we advocate that the size of @xmath0 is understood as a group theoretical consequence rather than a perturbed effect from the tri - bi - maximal mixing . </S>",
    "<S> so , the difference of two models is designed only in terms of the flavor symmetry , by changing the charge assignment of righthanded neutrinos . the pmns matrix in the first model is obtained from both mass matrices , charged leptons giving rise to non - zero @xmath2 and neutrino masses giving rise to tri - bi - maximal mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the physical mixing angles are expressed by a simple relation between @xmath2 and tri - bi - maximal angles to fit the recent experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the other model generates pmns matrix with non - zero @xmath0 , only from the neutrino mass transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the 5 dimensional effective theory of majorana neutrinos obtained in this framework is tested with phenomenological bounds in the parametric spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 . </S>"
