    "this translates into an initial orbital separation of 18 au and period of 76 yr .",

    "as the helium shell flash develops , the helium convective zone grows in mass until , near the peak of the flash , its outer edge extends into the hydrogen - rich layer .",
    "hydrogen is carried downward by convection until it reaches a point where the lifetime of a proton becomes less than the convective mixing timescale ; then , hydrogen burns via the @xmath16 reaction .",
    "the energy flux due to this reaction causes the convective zone to split into two parts , the outer one driven by the energy flux due to hydrogen burning and the inner one driven by the energy flux due to helium burning . the convective shell engendered by hydrogen burning transports c- and n - rich matter outwards where it can ultimately be dredged up and incorporated into the surface convective zone . in models with large core masses , the convective shell sustained by helium burning persists even after the hydrogen - driven convective zone has disappeared @xcite .    before the split into two convective zones ,",
    "some of the mixed - in hydrogen is captured by @xmath17c ; the product is carried inward and , after the split , is trapped in the surviving helium convective zone as @xmath18n and/or as its daughter @xmath18c . at the high temperatures in the surviving helium convective shell , the reaction @xmath19 occurs , with interesting consequences , as demonstrated by @xcite for a @xmath20 star with @xmath0}= -2.7",

    ", we adopt the same one - zone approximation used by @xcite .",
    "we treat the amount of mixed @xmath18c as a parameter since this amount varies with the strength of the helium shell flash , which depends on stellar mass , and , also , is a function of the treatment of convection .",

    "as soon as @xmath22 is mixed into the convective zone , it rapidly reacts with helium to produce neutrons .",
    "the neutrons so produced are captured primarily by @xmath23 to form @xmath22 and then reappear in consequence of additional @xmath19 reactions .",
    "this neutron cycling process continues until the @xmath24 reaction has converted most of the initially injected @xmath22 into @xmath25o .",
    "then , @xmath26 capture on @xmath25o , which occurs @xmath27 times more slowly than capture on @xmath18c at the relevant temperatures , starts to produce neutrons via the reaction @xmath28 .",
    "the newly formed @xmath29ne consumes neutrons to yield heavier isotopes of ne and isotopes of na and mg .",
    "if the iron - group elements exist in the helium convective zone , most of them are converted into heavy _",
    "s_-process elements .",
    "therefore , in the case of stars formed from a polluted cloud or stars with helium convective zones that were polluted by accreted metals during he - fddm , the upper limit of the surface lead enhancement for he0107 - 5240  becomes [ pb / fe ] @xmath30 .",
    "we emphasize that the appearance of @xmath18c in a convective shell occurs only once . during subsequent thermal pulses , any @xmath18c that might be formed because of extra - mixing would be burned radiatively between pulses @xcite .",
