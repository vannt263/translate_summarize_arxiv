    "the discovery of dark energy is a landmark of cosmology . in 1998",
    "@xcite , it became known that our universe is accelerating according to the observation data from the distant supernova .",
    "this fact was proved later by further ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite and microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite of wmap .",
    "the special matter contained a negative pressure which can drive the universe acceleration , called dark energy .",
    "the large scale distribution of galaxies observations @xcite also tells us there is about 70% dark energy in the universe , which seems more like an evenly distributed background component and it can not assemble in the large scale .",
    "else , the theories of big bang nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation confine in the early universe the ratio of dark energy to very small values and only it becomes large after galaxy formation . in the theoretical analysis ,",
    "the simplest candidate is the cosmological constant .",
    "if so , our universe will be further accelerating and the whole space will more like a de sitter topological structure .",
    "the cosmological constant combined to cold dark matter leads to a so - called @xmath3cdm cosmological model @xcite . in spite of the success of @xmath3cdm model in many respects ,",
    "there are still two big troubles in this model ; i.e. the famous fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence problems .",
    "hence , many theoretical physicists prefer a dynamical dark energy model to a @xmath3cdm model .",
    "the simplest dynamical model is a quintessence field which is a scalar field with canonical momentum @xcite .",
    "when quintessence rolls along itself the potential curve , it will provide a negative pressure if the potential curve is very flat i.e. the quintessence field is at a slow roll state .",
    "else , its attractor solution can solve the cosmic coincidence very well .    as we know",
    "that , the cosmological constant model can give a static spherically symmetric black hole i.e. schwarzschild - de sitter black hole ( sds - bh ) which is corresponding to a usual schwarzschild case .",
    "however , how to obtain a counterpoint to that of schwarzschild case just like the sds - bh in cosmological constant model ?",
    "after this problem occurred some fundamental work had been done by people such as gonzalez@xcite , chernin et.al.@xcite and kiselev @xcite and so on . in the early works ,",
    "there were no horizon and no ` hair ' problems @xcite which means no black hole could be embraced into these metrics .",
    "later , in order to solve this problem kiselev employed nonzero off - diagonal energy momentum tensor in which its coefficients satisfied additivity and linearity conditions .",
    "hence , a steady black hole solution is obtained @xcite .",
    "the process is introduced simply in part ii .",
    "since kiselev @xcite obtained the exact black hole solutions encoded in quintessence , many people have performed studies on its special properties including : quasinormal frequencies ( qnm ) @xcite , thermodynamics entropy @xcite , gravity geodesic precession@xcite and the classical three gravity tests on solar system @xcite and so on .",
    "the last phenomenology aspects refer to the gravitational frequency shift , the deflection of light and the precession of perihelion of mercury . in ref.@xcite via calculating the photon s 4d momentum , it is found that the photon frequency increases for the range @xmath4 $ ] and decreases for the range @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the quintessence state parameter satisfying the equation of sate ( eos ) .",
    "the field parameter @xmath0 is sensitively dependent on the state parameter @xmath6 . comparing with the h - masers of the gp - a redshift experiment data , the constraint on quintessence matter",
    "is @xmath7 with the range @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "meanwhile , for the light deflect test its influence behaviors also are different according to various @xmath6 values .",
    "the analytic results are obtained via the integral photon s binet equation with special solvable value @xmath9 . by using the long - baseline radio interferometry data , the corresponding constraints on the quintessence field parameter @xmath10",
    "are obtained where the label ",
    "@xmath11 \" means that there is no influence on the deflection of light by quintessence for the case @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "then after that , the test of perihelion advance has been presented in ref .",
    "the trajectory of the test mass and the motion of a binary system are discussed in detail . however , as far as we know there is no work relating to  the fourth test \" @xcite in gravity field i.e. time delay in gravity test . considering the above various factors , we calculate carefully the behavior of gravity time delay influenced by quintessence matter and",
    "try to find the constraints on quintessence field parameter in alternative view here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the kiselev solution briefly . in section iii , we use the lagrangian method to find the analytic expression of time delay in different points . in section iv",
    ", we use the data of the viking lander on mars and the cassini spacecraft on the way to saturn to constrain the quintessence field parameter .",
    "section v is the conclusion .",
    "we adopt the signature @xmath13 and put @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 equal to unity .",
    "the modified schwarzschild space surrounded by static spherically symmetric quintessence matter is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the black hole mass , @xmath6 is the state parameter of quintessence , @xmath0 is the corresponding quintessence field parameter . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the quintessence field with @xmath6 in the range of @xmath19 $ ] without considering the supernova dimming .",
    "interestingly , this metric reduces to the pure schwarzschild space and the schwarzschild - de sitter space for the cases of @xmath20 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the energy momentum coupling with evenly distributed quintessence is shown as @xmath21,\\label{ij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the density of quintessence matter .",
    "the internal structure @xmath23 function satisfied @xmath24 via the additivity and linearity principle @xmath25 .",
    "the isotropic average over the angle components is @xmath26 where the relationship @xmath27 is used and the state equation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    with the relationship @xmath30 , the energy momentum tensor components are @xmath31 the quintessence density is @xmath32 so",
    "if we require the density of energy positive , @xmath33 , we deduce that @xmath0 is negative for @xmath6 negative .",
    "the curvature has the form of @xmath34 apparently , @xmath35 is the singularity for @xmath36 .",
    "the free quintessence creates an outer horizon of de sitter universe at @xmath37 for @xmath38 and also generates an inner horizon of black hole at @xmath37 for @xmath39",
    "except for the gravitational redshift @xcite , perihelion procession @xcite and bending of light @xcite , a further measurable effect concerning the null geodesics is the  time delay \" of radar signals . unlike the flat space , the travel time of light between any two given points increases due to the presence of space curvature .",
    "this type of travel increasing time can be measured via using the propagation of radar signals in solar system , which is proposed firstly by shapiro in 1964 @xcite .",
    "else , it is also constituted by the  fourth test \" of gr known as radar ranging @xcite . here ,",
    "the time delay for radar ranging is calculated in the space of metric ( [ metricq ] ) by the lagrangian method .",
    "the lagrangian for a test mass particle in the field described by the equation ( [ metricq ] ) is @xmath40^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the overdot represents differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath41 along the geodesics .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations read as follows @xmath42 without loss of generality , the observer is confined to orbits with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the lagrangian @xmath45 becomes @xmath46 according to the cyclic coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we can identify two constants of motion , @xmath49 the third motion equation can be given by the normalization relation of photons @xmath50 = 0 , @xmath51 the dynamic evolution of photon is determined fully by eqs.([m1 ] ) , ( [ m2 ] ) and ( [ m3 ] ) in this space . combining eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) with ( [ m3 ] ) , the photon s trajectory equation can be gotten as @xmath52 meanwhile , we define two new parameters , one is the impact parameter @xmath53 , which means the effective sighting range , the other is the photon s effective potential @xmath54 where @xmath55    according to eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) , the photons orbital equation ( [ trajectoryequation ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 the distance of closest approach @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 so we can get the relationship @xmath59 . according to eqs.([m2 ] ) and ( [ m3 ] ) , the differential relation between time @xmath48 and radius @xmath60 is obtained as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "so the time travel for the null geodesic is @xmath63^{-1/2 } = t(r , r_0)_{gr } + t(r , r_0)_{qm},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 \\frac{\\alpha}{2}. \\label{qm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term @xmath65 is the usual case in gr @xcite and the last one is the effect of quintessence field which will be solved particular in the remained parts .",
    "apparently , once the quintessence field disappears , the result is reduced to the schwarzschild one . because the undetermined state parameter @xmath6 which is coupling in the exponent of @xmath60 or @xmath57 , we select the solvable integers @xmath66 with @xmath8 $ ] to integrating eq .",
    "( [ qm2 ] ) .",
    "this kind of method , which also is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , is useful to solve approximately sophisticated differential equation in which the independent variable contains some unknown parameter .",
    "the integrating results are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the corresponding sketchy outline of the additional term @xmath67 versus radial @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it illustrates clearly that the influence of quintessence on time delay heightens with the decreasing quintessence state parameter @xmath6 correspondingly .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have used the lagrangian formulation to analyze the influence of quintessence field on  the fourth gravity test \" i.e. radar echo delay in a central gravity field without considering the internal charge . by using the data of viking lander and cassini mission , we have obtained the constraints of quintessence field from alternative channels .",
    "now , two points need to be emphasized especially as follows .",
    "there are two key parameters @xmath6 and @xmath0 in this model .",
    "the formal @xmath6 , which connects the pressure @xmath68 and energy density @xmath22 via the state equation @xmath69 , is the state parameter of the quintessence .",
    "the latter @xmath0 is the quintessence field parameter , which indicates the influence of quintessence matter over the space outside the black hole .",
    "here we need to pay more attention on the cause and effect of @xmath0 . in kiselev s original work @xcite , one additively and linearity condition @xmath70 is adopted to solve the previous  no hair no horizon \" problem @xcite . combining the einstein equation in spherically symmetric static space ,",
    "the quintessence energy momentum tensors ( [ tt ] ) and ( [ ij ] ) are finally reduced into a differential equation , @xmath71 where function @xmath72 is decided by metric function @xmath73 via @xmath74",
    ". then eq.([fequation ] ) has two solutions , @xmath75 here , @xmath0 and @xmath76 are the normalization factors .",
    "@xmath76 is the usual schwarzschild solution and @xmath0 represents the quintessence field parameter .",
    "the expression ( [ fq ] ) is the original position where parameter @xmath0 appear firstly in this model .",
    "it is helpful to understand its meaning from two aspects .",
    "one is the density of the quintessence energy @xmath77 .",
    "so the sign of normalization constant @xmath0 and the matter state parameter @xmath6 have to satisfy the condition of @xmath78 .",
    "considering the fixed state parameter , the quintessence increases with bigger @xmath0 .",
    "hence , its magnitude manifests enough the strength of quintessence field .",
    "the other feature is the curvature of space @xmath79 .",
    "if one fixes the state parameter , we can find the curvature @xmath80 will be larger with bigger @xmath81 where this point also means the space will be bended more . from the expressions of density",
    "we can find that the dimension of @xmath0 is sensitively dependent on the value of state parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the specific dimensional form of @xmath0 is expressed in table 6.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite according to various state parameters .",
    "if the quintessence field could be treated as the dark energy and the critical density of the universe could be assumed as the value of @xmath22 , we could find that with bigger astronomical scales the magnitude of @xmath81 is larger .",
    "in another words , the quintessence field can have influence more deeply on the large astronomical scale .",
    "\\2 . in this model",
    ", we only consider a neutral black hole as well as sds - bh .",
    "the internal charge is not involved in this paper .",
    "if we want to consider the charged case , it should refer to the general solution for the reissner - nordstr@xmath82m - de sitter black hole surrounded by the quintessence matter @xcite , which is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "if we choose the simplest singular schwarzschild case @xcite , the last term can be reduced to @xmath85 just like this model .",
    "this solution ( [ charge ] ) also has a rich spectrum of limits .",
    "if @xmath86 , there will be no charge . if @xmath87 , there will be no de sitter curvature .",
    "if @xmath88 , it will become a self - gravitating quintessence without black hole .",
    "hence , if we consider the internal charge , we must start from another metric space , @xmath89    we thank the anonymous referee for quite helpful comments and suggestions .",
