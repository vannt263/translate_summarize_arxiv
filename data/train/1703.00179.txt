    "an example of the experimental configuration is presented in fig.[fig1 ] , corresponding to the scheme ( c ) of fig.1 of the main text .        the gain in the active links is provided by 1.5  m erbium - doped optical fiber(s ) , pumped by @xmath44 power laser(s ) .",
    "other optical amplification methods can be used as well such as soas etc . in the setup of fig.[fig1 ] , the gain section ( pictured in the left side ) is composed also by input and output wavelength demuxs ( wdms ) to couple and decouple the pump beam to / from the @xmath45 signal beam .",
    "an optical isolator assures the unidirectional propagation of the signal beam in the gain link .",
    "the currents of the pump lasers represent the main control parameters of our setup , as they are directly related to the field amplification in the active links : an arbitrary number of them can be active simultaneously and independently . throughout the text",
    "we will denote the pump current by @xmath46 whenever a single active fiber is present and with @xmath47 in the case of two ( or more ) .",
    "the index @xmath14 indicates the number of the corresponding link ( see the caption of fig.3 of the main text ) .    the network section ( central part of fig.[fig1 ] )",
    "is build using single - mode optical fiber and standard , @xmath48 loss - less optical couplers .",
    "a @xmath49 splitting ratio has been used for all the network splitters in the configurations here considered .",
    "different ratios or number of ports may be used ; besides , alternative standard fiber communication devices such as circulators can also be used to implement other coupling configurations .",
    "the detection is performed by inserting in a network link a @xmath50 optical coupler .",
    "the split field intensity is collected in the proper direction either with a high bandwidth ( @xmath51 ) or low bandwidth ( @xmath52 ) , high sensitivity pin photodetectors .",
    "the detector current is then sent to a rf spectrum analyzer and/or a fast digital oscilloscope .",
    "the measurement of the intensity histograms of a certain frequency peak is carried out acquiring a small frequency interval with the rf spectrum analyzer around the target frequency and storing the maximum value for every scan ; the measurement parameters were checked to insure a consistent procedure .",
    "the time - resolved , amplitude dynamics of a given frequency is obtained by beating the detected signal with an oscillator reference waveform at such frequency , using a rf mixer and then filtering out the high frequency components of the beating signal . the output",
    "is then acquired with a digital scope .",
    "the detection / measuring section is depicted in the right part of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the calculation of stationary modes of the network is based on standard linear optics and conceptually similar to the case of the computation of spectrum of a quantum graphs @xcite .",
    "we look for solutions where the envelope of the optical field on each fiber is given by two counter - propagating plane waves .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider first a single 2@xmath532 loss - less coupler .",
    "we define , at each of the four ports , the column vectors of input and output amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( this requires fixing a port numbering ) .",
    "they are related via the a scattering matrix @xmath56 .",
    "the splitting of the field follows an unitary transformation ( energy conservation through the splitter ) . under a prescribed convention , we can parametrize it through the transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath57 such that @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is also termed as the _ splitting factor _ ( @xmath61 throughout the paper ) .",
    "moreover , the splitters are reflectionless and this impose some further constraint on the form @xmath62 .",
    "altogether @xmath63 the blocks connecting @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 ( upper right and bottom left respectively ) are unitary matrix as noted before . as a consequence ,",
    "the matrix @xmath62 is unitary as well .    in the case of @xmath0 splitters",
    "that , for simplicity , we assume to be all equal as above , we can extend the definitions introducing the @xmath68-dimensional column vectors of input and output amplitudes @xmath69 and @xmath70 whose components are taken ordered in such a way that @xmath71 and the complete scattering matrix is in block - diagonal form @xmath72 the unitary matrix @xmath13 describes the transfer properties of the splitters ( or , in general , of the optical components at the nodes of the network ) and it is not dependent from the gains and from the topology of the network .",
    "it is readily generalized to the case of a set of different splitters each having different transmission coefficients and/or port numbers .    within a linear description of the network",
    ", we assume that the field though the link @xmath14 ( of length @xmath6 ) is multiplied by a factor @xmath73 , according to the definition of the field variables , we can write this condition in terms of the _ propagation matrix _ @xmath12 @xmath74 where in a fully connected network @xmath75 ; @xmath12 contains the full information on the topology of the network via the _ connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix _ ( how the links are connected through the splitters ) and on the gain in the links .",
    "it has some properties dictated by the physical nature of the connections : ( i ) since every port of all splitters is connected to one and only one ( different ) port , @xmath12 has exactly one element different from zero in every row and in every column ; ( ii ) since a port can not be connected to itself , the diagonal elements of @xmath12 vanish ; ( iii ) @xmath76 .",
    "combining equations ( [ pmat ] ) and ( [ smat ] ) and imposing that the resulting linear homogeneous systems has nontrivial solutions yields the condition ( 1 ) given in the main text with @xmath77 .",
    "we also checked that the integrated density of states , namely the number of modes below @xmath78 grows on average linearly , as expected from the weyl law for one - dimensional structure @xcite .",
    "the above definitions require some minor adaptation to account for the presence of optical isolators as in this case some components are not allowed to propagate and thus the corresponding elements of @xmath12 are zero",
    ".    a more complete description of the mathematical details will be given elsewhere .",
    "the optical network is mapped on a directed graph using the following procedure . a new matrix @xmath79",
    "is built from @xmath19 by replacing its non - zero elements with @xmath80 s ; @xmath79 is then interpreted as the adjacency matrix of the associated graph .",
    "each vertex of the graph represents the optical mode propagating along one of the two allowed directions in a link ; conventionally , we plot it as a empty - red ( filled - black ) dot whether such link does ( does not ) contain a gain element .",
    "when a link accommodates an optical isolator , the vertex in the graph corresponding to the blocked mode is removed ( the related element in the adjacency matrix is zero ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the graph is _ pruned _ : the above vertex and all the incoming / outcoming bonds connected to it are erased .",
    "we remark that , the lasing action can happen only if at least a empty - red vertex is present in the graph . , i.e. networks whose graphs contain only filled - black vertices can not lase and therefore be detectable .",
    "the observable is the field in the links , detected inserting additional power splitters ; both propagation directions are accessible . the signal is detected with photodetectors , yielding an electric signal proportional to the intensity of the field . as a consequence , in the present setup",
    ", we can not directly access to the full information of the field , but only to the _ beating of all the optical modes _ within the observational bandwidth ( see the panels in fig .",
    "2 ) to compare the measurements with the theory , we thus start from the optical spectrum numerically computed as described and we proceed as follows . from a given set of @xmath79 values of the wavenumbers @xmath29",
    "we compute all the differences @xmath81 belonging to a given interval @xmath82 , with @xmath70 being an assigned bandwidth .",
    "an histogram of such data is than evaluated , comparing to the experimental rf spectra .",
    "the numerical results and the measurements are reported in the figs.2d - e .",
    "another measured quantity is @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the experimentally measured positions of the peaks ( evaluated by a quadratic interpolation around the relative maxima ) and @xmath85 is a window function @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the largest value in the set .",
    "it can be shown that this observable is approximately proportional to the so - called length spectrum , namely the squared modulus of the fourier transform of the density of states .",
    "the latter has been used to characterize the spectra of quantum graphs in terms of the classical periodic orbits @xcite . in the numerical calculations , where we have access to the actual wavenumbers",
    "@xmath29 we checked that definition ( [ lensp ] ) yields the same peak structure as the length spectrum itself .",
    "the evolution is simulated in terms of ray dynamics .",
    "a discrete - time evolution scheme is implemented over the network of interest with a monte - carlo approach . in a single realization",
    ", a starting initial condition is prepared as a ray in a link ; at every time step , it moves in the link along the initial direction .",
    "when a splitter is approached , the ray chooses one of the two possible exits selected according to the outcome of a continuous , uniform random process with probability 0.5 ( in general , with the branch - specific splitting ratio of the splitter used ) and it is amplified according to the former link gain ( or attenuation ) , with a saturation nonlinearity that prevents the dynamics to diverge .",
    "the detection is carried out by reading the intensity at every step in a fixed position on a link ( eulerian detection ) . to improve the statistics ,",
    "an initial ensemble of rays has been used , corresponding to fully populate a link with pulses and let them evolve ."

    "<S> the first feature that we demonstrate is the existence of a well defined threshold for lasing , which manifests experimentally as a sudden switching of an increasingly large number of distinct peaks in the emission spectrum upon increasing of the pump current . </S>",

    "<S> their interaction between such increasing number of active modes is not apparently strong enough to determine a standard chaotic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig2]b reports the histogram of the beatings obtained from the computation of the poles @xmath21 : all the possible differences in frequency are evaluated for the lasing modes ( those with @xmath22 ) and their distribution is plotted . </S>",

    "<S> for the case at hand ( _ er@xmath24_-doped medium ) , this is estimated to be of the order of some tens of _ nm _ , so that more that @xmath25 modes may be excited . the peaks frequency is not significantly affected by the pumping , indicating that the nonlinearity only saturates the amplitude and gain dispersion is negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results are reminiscent of highly - multimode lasers behavior ; however , the possible choice of complex network topologies and arbitrary numbers of gain sections permit a generalization of the geometries for e.g. longitudinal lasers . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this sets the peculiar statistical features of our system that we discuss below .    </S>",
    "<S> the classical dynamics of particles on graphs is a chaotic type of diffusive process @xcite that can be described theoretically by simple one - dimensional piecewise chaotic maps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that this reflects in the statistical properties of the spectra as thoroughly investigated in the quantum chaos literature . for comparison , we numerically computed the nearest - neighbor level spacing distribution @xmath26 where @xmath27 are normalized to the average @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> all the computed @xmath29 were included in the analysis regardless of the sign of @xmath30 and the distributions averaged over a set of graphs with the same topology and random lengths . </S>",
    "<S> even for the case above threshold , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d shows that @xmath26 resembles the wigner - dyson distribution @xmath31 typical of chaotic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> actually , individual realizations typically display a level repulsion similar to what demonstrated for the hamiltonian case @xcite but deviations are expected in view of the smallness the graph .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig2]e we also report the fourier transform of the beating spectrum @xmath32 which is closely related to the _ length spectrum _ ( see suppl . material ) ; it is experimentally accessible and relates the spectra to the underlying classical periodic orbits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the experimental results ( black peaks ) well fit the theoretical prediction ( vertical red lines ) expressing the lengths as combination of the three _ ring _ paths of lengths @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not contributing independently as expected .    the interplay of diffusion and amplification of photons in scattering media , as it occurs in random lasers @xcite , can lead to heavy - tailed distributions of emission intensities , characterized by lvy -stable statistics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical prediction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has been confirmed in several experiments @xcite . to the extent in which the photons in our networks can be treated as particle undergoing chaotic diffusion , it is thus plausible that the same phenomenology may also occur in the laner . </S>",
    "<S> we consider first the configuration in fig.[fig1b]b . as evidenced by the graph </S>",
    "<S> , it may represent the simpler scheme in our setup where orbits with gain and with losses coexist , thus realizing the basic scenario for chaotic diffusion with gain . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . using a time - resolved analysis of the amplitude behavior of the peaks , the dynamics of the emission intensity at @xmath38  mhz </S>",
    "<S> is reported in the fig.[fig3]a - b . </S>",
    "<S> the emission shows rare , large spikes with strong intermittent fluctuations both in amplitude and time duration . in fig.[fig3]c </S>",
    "<S> we present the histograms @xmath39 of such emission , exhibiting a clear evidence of a lvy process ( magenta dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the same pump current , other peaks display instead a log - normal distribution ; we shown e.g. in the figure the case of @xmath40  mhz ( yellow ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same results can be found in the configuration in fig.[fig1b]c ( a distribution is shown in the inset of fig.[fig3]c ) and , in spite of the different location of the gain ( now in the link ( 4 ) ) , in the configuration in fig.[fig1b]d .    the fact that anomalous fluctuations only occur at some beating frequencies can be justified as follows . in analogy with the random laser case @xcite , we expect fluctuations to occur only for modes which are close enough to threshold , namely those with @xmath41 with @xmath42 being some small characteristic value . </S>",
    "<S> if , as suggested by fig.[fig2]c , the poles density is roughly uniform , the typical spectral separation between such modes is inversely proportional to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , strongly fluctuating modes will only contribute to the subset of the beatings lying at a distance of order @xmath43 , while only far - from - threshold modes will contribute to the remaining , yielding a log - normal statistics .    to further check the interpretation </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the two cases of fig.[fig1b]a and fig.[fig1b]e . in the former , only orbits with gain </S>",
    "<S> are possible , thus indicating the settling of saturated , log - normally distributed peaks at the cavity resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed expected as the configuration realizes the standard , mono - directional ring laser : without the isolator the network would be represented by two _ disjoint _ active graphs , with a bistable statistics describing the random jumps between the two emitted modes .    in the latter , a more complicate situation appears due to the effect of two gains . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider that the link ( 1 ) only in fig.[fig1b]e provides gain ( the link ( 4 ) is now passive , i.e. its laser pump current is kept sufficiently low ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we found the same phenomenology reported above ; an example of the lvy statistics for a peak is reported in fig.[fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> as a second case , we increase the pump current in link ( 4 ) so that it has gain as well . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution now shows a multistable shape ( see inset ) ; an inspection of the equivalent graph reveals that _ there are nt orbits without gain_. thus , besides the complex geometry of the network we are dealing with an extension of the ring laser : the multistability arises from the system switching between the saturated modes of the cavity .    to strengthen the theoretical description , we have compared the experimental findings with a monte - carlo type of model ( see suppl . </S>",
    "<S> material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation scheme propagates a set of rays through the network assigning an intensity each that grows or decreases depending on the local value of the gains @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> whenever a ray reaches a splitter , it is transmitted towards one of the connected fiber chosen at random : the transition probability is given by the splitting factors . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , the ray motion is a random walk on the graph , while the accumulated intensity depends on the whole walk history . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation data ( for the case of fig.[fig1b]c ) is presented in fig.[fig3]e , showing the temporal behavior of the intensity collected at one point of the network . the distribution of the data is well fitted with a lvy distribution ( fig.[fig3]f ) .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the laner as an optical scheme showing laser action and characterized by a fully controllable topological disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we studied its emission statistics at the laser threshold , evidencing heavy - tails fluctuations with l ' evy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> they are the typical signature of the interplay of chaotic diffusion and amplification of the photons in the network and indicate that the laner represents an intermediate case between the standard and the random laser . in particular , the possibility to include multiple and independent gain sections is shared with the latter , but the scheme we have introduced has several advantages in terms of flexibility and control . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is continuous - wave pumped at variance with standard random laser experiments . from the point of view of basic research , the laner would allow different investigations , ranging from dynamics on networks of increasing complexity to the effect of the cavity topology on the laser emission .    </S>",
