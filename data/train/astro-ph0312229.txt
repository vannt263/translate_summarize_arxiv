    "confusion problem has been investigated and formulated mainly by radio astronomers in relation to the so - called fluctuation analysis or @xmath3 analysis @xcite .",

    ", while it is a convenient method for theoretical predictions , observationally it is quite rare that we can obtain spatial information at the early phase of a survey .",
    "hence , we need a method to evaluate the confusion _ only from the projected information of source clustering_. in this line , @xcite has pioneered the methodology to tackle the riddle , but his results were restricted to a few simple cases . since then , little analytical progress on this topic has been made up to now .    in this work , by making extensive use of the methods of the theory of point process , we show the general analytic formula for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . in section  [ sec : fluctuation ]",

    "problems with gaussian noise is beautifully formulated by @xcite .",
    "their setting assumes that the dispersion of the error does not depend on the source flux .",
    "even in such a simple case , @xcite showed that the confusion noise can be very severe for sources with low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "they pointed out that when the confusion noise dominate the error , the total noise can not be gaussian , and gave a qualitative discussion on the problem .",
    "they claim to use a monte carlo approach to evaluate in that case .",
    "however , as we will discuss in the subsequent subsections , we have an expression for the fluctuation field , and we can utilize the information for evaluating the effect of the confusion noise in general cases . @xcite",
    "properly distinguish between the problems of _ confusion _ and _ blending _ : the former generally means that the source flux is affected by fainter sources , which can not be detected by the considered instrument individually , and the latter indicates that the source flux is affected by fainter sources , which is bright enough to be detected as a source if they were located far from the central brightest source .",
    "the term ` confusion limit ' is related to the former phenomenon , and consequently , confusion limit flux is weaker than the noise flux for bright sources .    how to treat these two effects in a unified manner ?",
    "of course they occur in a same way , hence there is no distinction in principle .",
    "consider an ideal situation that there are no detector noise , photon noise , read - out noise , nor any other cosmological diffuse background radiation with structure .",

    "however , @xcite pointed out that there is a possibility that the signal @xmath37 consists of two or more sources with fluxes fainter than @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of such multiple source blending is obtained by the same manner as discussed in  [ sec : fluctuation ] .",
    "again we should consider @xmath113 , under the condition @xmath114 and the probability of having a noise intensity @xmath37 produced by @xmath81 sources is expressed by a convolution [ equation  ( [ eq : dfx_conv ] ) ] . for @xmath37 to be a mere noise , there must not be sources brighter than @xmath10 in a beam .",
    "hence , we should derive the conditional probability of having @xmath37 caused by @xmath81 sources under the condition @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and then sum up for all @xmath81s .",

    "but such a rapid increase of infrared galaxy can not be continued toward a fainter flux level , because the integrated infrared flux from galaxies must not exceed the observational constraint of the cosmic infrared background ( for the details , see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this makes a change of the slope of the observed number counts of galaxies .",
    "we show some calculations of the confusion limits for such realistic counts based on an empirical model of @xcite .",

    "the calculation method is the same for the case of power - law number counts , except that we should use equation  ( [ eq : conf_general_cluster ] ) instead of equation  ( [ eq : conf_power_cluster ] ) .",
    "we obtained the confusion limits of 1.8  mjy for unclustered sources and 2.0  mjy for clustered sources for a model number count at @xmath187 m .",

    "thus in the far - infrared , source clustering does not affect the confusion limit significantly .",
    "this is explained as follows : since the cosmic expansion makes the slope flatter toward fainter fluxes , the count slope becomes sub - euclidean at the flux level we consider here , in spite of the strong galaxy evolution .",
    "the effect of clustering is dominated by the faintest clustered sources , hence the decrease of differential counts makes the effect rather small .",
    "then , let us consider the pdf of the fluctuation for realistic number counts .",
    "we calculated the pdf for wavelengths @xmath190 , and @xmath189 m . figures  [ fig : conf_noise060 ] , [ fig : conf_noise090 ] , and [ fig : conf_noise170 ] show the pdfs of the fluctuation in these wavelengths .",
    "just as seen in the power - law count models , the peak probability decreases up to @xmath2  % , and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier .",

    "if we assume that the scuba galaxies have the same clustering property with _ iras _  galaxies , clustering increases the confusion limit from 20  % to 100  % , depending on the adopted assumption for the spectral energy distribution of galaxies .",

    "clustering increases the confusion effect to some extent , but it is not an easy task to formulate the effect in the confusion problem . by using a model for spatial correlation functions , @xcite showed a useful result for the contribution of clustering to the fluctuation of the background at submillimeter and radio wavelengths .",
    "observationally , however , the method to evaluate the confusion only from two - dimensional information of clustering is desirable . in this line ,",
    "only the work of @xcite has made attempt to tackle the difficult problem and given solutions to a few simple cases .    in this work , by making extensive use of the methods related to the point field theory , we derived general analytic formulae for the confusion problems with arbitrary distribution and correlation functions . with these formulae , we can obtain the statistical properties of the confusion noise caused by the sources with some prescribed two - dimensional correlation structure .",
    "based on the general formulae , we first calculated the confusion limits from the power - law galaxy number counts as a test case for the analysis of infrared galaxies .",
    "we considered an infrared facility with an aperture of 70 cm and an ideal airy psf . for galaxy clustering",
    ", we adopted the hierarchical _ ansatz _ to calculate higher - order correlation functions used in our formulation . without clustering ,",
    "the confusion limits would be 3.1mjy , 23  mjy , and 138  mjy for the indices @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "if we take into account the effect of clustering properly , they become 3.8  mjy , 120  mjy , and 9.9  jy , for @xmath169 , 2.0 , and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "we also obtained the probability density function ( pdf ) of the fluctuation intensity , @xmath25 .",
    "we found a broadening of the pdf by clustering , i.e. , increase of the variance , corresponding to the increase of the confusion limit flux density .",
    "when @xmath0 approaches to 2.0 , the clustering effect becomes very severe for a power - law number counts .",
    "then we estimated the pdf and confusion limits based on the realistic number count model of @xcite , under the same hypothetical infrared facility . at @xmath191",
    "m , we obtained confusion limits of 2.0mjy for infrared galaxies . at @xmath188 m and @xmath189 m ,",
    "the confusion limits are 12.3mjy and 120mjy , respectively .",
    "these estimates are not much different from the limits calculated without clustering [ 1.8mjy ( @xmath191 m ) , 11.4mjy ( @xmath188 m ) , and 105mjy ( @xmath189 m ) ] .",
    "the gradual flattening of the number count slope toward the fainter flux densities , which is observed for infrared galaxies , makes the clustering effect very small , even though the slope is very steep at @xmath192 . as for the pdf at these wavelength bands",
    ", the peak probability also decreases up to @xmath2  % , and the tail of the pdf becomes heavier .",
    "the clustering effect may not seem very severe , because present data generally suffer from more serious noise sources and/or systematics .",
    "however , we must keep this effect in mind when we estimate galaxy evolution from the fluctuation analysis of the data by _ astro - f _ and _",
