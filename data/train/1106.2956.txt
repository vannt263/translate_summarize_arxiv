    "supersymmetric extension of the standard model is one of interesting and promising candidates for physics above the weak scale .",
    "even if supersymmetry ( susy ) is realized at high - energy regime , it must be broken below the weak scale , because the superpartners of the standard model particles have not been observed .",
    "it is well known that susy breaking inside our visible sector often leads to phenomenological problems , for which one usually needs to introduce the hidden sector for susy breaking and its mediation .",
    "recently , several important properties of susy breaking were clarified in the framework of global susy with the canonical khler potential ; the susy - breaking vacuum of f - term scalar potential has pseudo - moduli or tachyonic direction at tree level . in addition",
    ", a superpartner of a massless fermion remains massless or becomes tachyonic ( even ) when susy is broken in renormalizable wess - zumino models .",
    "the latter fact is called the komargodski - shih ( ks ) lemma in this paper . the general proof of these properties",
    "has recently been given in  @xcite .",
    "the above result has important phenomenological implications , particularly to the gauge mediation of susy breaking .",
    "the gauge mediation is one of interesting mechanisms to mediate susy breaking in the hidden sector to the visible sector at quantum level ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of pseudo - moduli and the ks lemma imply vanishing gaugino masses at the one - loop order or the existence of tachyonic direction  @xcite .",
    "that is phenomenologically unfavorable since gaugino masses are relatively light compared with susy - breaking scalar masses .",
    "such a problem was found empirically in a direct gauge mediation model  @xcite and a solution has been proposed with higher - energy local minimum  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that the result would not hold if one changes any of the model assumptions , that is , the tree - level f - term scalar potential of global susy wess - zumino model with the canonical khler form .",
    "a possible remedy is to consider the effect of non - canonical ( higher - dimensional ) khler potential  @xcite such as in supergravity .",
    "this change however might spoil the predictability / calculability of gauge mediation . as for the loop - level effect",
    ", it would be interesting to combine the gauge mediation with the anomaly mediation  @xcite without losing their merits ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting way out is to include the non - vanishing d - term scalar potential of additional gauge group . in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the susy breaking with f and d - term scalar potentials of global susy models in which the khler form is canonical .",
    "the models are classified into two categories under the criterion that the f - flatness conditions have a solution or not .",
    "we then call models are in the first class when there exists no solution , i.e.  f - term susy breaking .",
    "on the other hand , we call models are in the second class when there exists a solution satisfying all the f - flatness conditions but it is destabilized by the d - term contribution . a non - vanishing ( charged ) f term is generally required to have a non - vanishing d term , and therefore susy - breaking models with f and d terms belong to each of these two classes .    in the first class ,",
    "the pseudo - moduli appear in the f - term scalar potential . as we will show , once the d - term contribution",
    "is included , such a pseudo - moduli direction has a runaway behavior , where the expectation value runs away to the infinity and the vacuum is undetermined . in the second class , susy breaking can be realized when and only when a non - vanishing fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term is introduced .",
    "we thus find that the second class of models is useful to avoid the discussion of komargodski and shih and to generate one - loop order gaugino masses in the visible sector through gauge mediation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fterm ] , we give a brief review on some important properties of susy - breaking models only with the f - term scalar potential . in section",
    "[ sec : dterm ] , we systematically study generic aspects of f and d - term susy breaking",
    ". the above two classes of models are investigated in details . in section  [ sec : gaugino_mass ] , we present a simple model of gauge mediation and show that the gaugino mass is generated on the stable vacuum . section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summarizing our results . in appendix",
    ", we summarize the stationary conditions for the first class of models discussed in section  [ sec : dterm ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review some general features of f - term susy - breaking models , explaining the existence of a pseudo - moduli direction and the ks lemma as well as their implications to the gauge mediation .",
    "we consider a model with the following general renormalizable superpotential @xmath0 where @xmath1 are chiral superfields and the subscript @xmath2 denotes the species of them .",
    "the khler potential has the canonical form ; @xmath3 .",
    "then the scalar potential @xmath4 receives the f - term contribution and is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath1 . by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . a similar notation for the field derivative",
    "is used for the potential @xmath4 and the d term @xmath10 . ] here and hereafter we follow the conventional notation that chiral superfields and their lowest scalar components are denoted by the same letters .",
    "let us suppose that the model has a susy - breaking minimum at @xmath11 where at least one of the f components is non - vanishing , @xmath12 for some @xmath2 . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the superscript @xmath13 to clarify that it is evaluated at the minimum of the f - term scalar potential , @xmath14 .",
    "the minimum satisfies the stationary condition @xmath15 since @xmath16 corresponds to the fermion mass matrix , the condition ( [ eq : wij ] ) implies that there is a massless fermion along the direction @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is nothing but the massless nambu - goldstone fermion corresponding to susy breaking .",
    "the boson mass - squared matrix at the minimum is given by @xmath19 \\sum_k w^{(0)}_{ijk}\\overline{w}^{(0)}_{\\bar{k } } &   \\sum_k w_{ik}^{(0)}\\overline{w}_{\\bar{k}\\bar{j}}^{(0 ) } \\end{pmatrix } , \\ ] ] in the basis @xmath20 .",
    "consider a massless fermion denoted by the eigenvector @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 .",
    "along its superpartner direction @xmath23 , the boson mass term in the scalar potential is evaluated as @xmath24 which can be made negative by a phase rotation of the eigenvector @xmath25 .",
    "hence this must vanish , @xmath26 for a positive semi - definite hermite @xmath27 , that is , as long as the vacuum is stable .",
    "in other words , a superpartner of a massless fermion must be massless or tachyonic ( even ) when susy is broken  @xcite . in particular , eq .  ( [ eq : wwv ] )",
    "is explicitly written down for the massless nambu - goldstone fermion for susy breaking ; @xmath28 the f - term potential has a tree - level flat direction ( pseudo - moduli ) parametrized as @xmath29 that is easily confirmed by showing that @xmath6 is invariant along this direction : @xmath30 with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wij ] ) and ( [ eq : wijk ] ) .",
    "we have discussed the ks lemma and the presence of pseudo - moduli for the susy - breaking wess - zumino models .",
    "these two properties hold even when a model contains higher - order superpotential terms such as in the generalized oraifeartaigh model discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the most generic superpotential form of generalized oraifeartaigh models studied in @xcite is @xmath31 the numbers of @xmath32 and @xmath33 fields , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , satisfy @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are generic functions of @xmath38 . in this case , some f components in @xmath32 become nonzero in the susy - breaking vacuum , and the pseudo - moduli direction is therefore a linear combination of @xmath32",
    ". many concrete examples of susy breaking is classified into this form and share the vacuum property discussed in this section .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that f - term susy - breaking models lead to a phenomenological problem when they are used for the hidden sector of gauge mediation ; vanishing gaugino masses or unstable hidden sector somewhere in the pseudo - moduli space . to see this ,",
    "let us start with the susy - breaking wess - zumino model in the canonical form @xmath39 the susy - breaking minimum satisfies @xmath40 and the scalar potential has the corresponding pseudo - moduli direction .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath41 is non - vanishing for generic @xmath42 , that is , massless eigenstates are irrelevant for gauge mediation and removed from the following discussion . by definition , the determinant is a polynomial of @xmath42 and is expanded as @xmath43 unless @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 , one always finds a solution for @xmath47 at some point @xmath48 on the pseudo - moduli direction .",
    "this fact means that the mass matrix @xmath49 has a zero eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector @xmath25 such that @xmath50 .",
    "then the ks lemma , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wwv ] ) , is found to imply @xmath51 if there is no tachyonic direction anywhere in the pseudo - moduli space .",
    "this contradicts with our assumption that @xmath52 is not identically zero . as a result",
    ", @xmath41 should not have any zero , and must be independent of @xmath42 ( @xmath53 for @xmath54 ) ; @xmath55    in gauge mediation , some fields @xmath56 play as the messenger of susy breaking which , by definition , have the gauge interaction to the standard model vector multiplets .",
    "the gauge invariance implies the mass matrix form @xmath57 the above statement , eq .",
    "( [ eq : const ] ) , holds for each of sub - matrices , i.e. , @xmath58 this fact leads to a problem that the standard - model gaugino masses are not generated at the leading order of gauge interactions ; @xmath59 thus the vacuum structure of f - term susy breaking has the phenomenological problem ( or unstable vacuum ) and is not suitable for gauge mediation . in the next section",
    ", we will examine how this situation is changed when the d - term scalar potential is included .",
    "to circumvent the phenomenologically unfavorable result of f - term susy breaking , we examine in this section how the situation can change with the d - term potential included .",
    "for this purpose , we first present some useful relations between the f and d components , and then investigate the vacuum of susy - breaking models with f and d terms .",
    "some discussions of the d - term potential in gauge mediation are given in  @xcite .      before proceeding the model classification",
    ", we give several useful relations between f and d components , satisfied identically and only on the vacuum .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the models with superpotential @xmath7 and u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the full scalar potential consists of the f and d terms @xmath60 where the d - term contribution is explicitly given by @xmath61 here @xmath62 denotes the gauge coupling constant and @xmath63 the u(1 ) charge of @xmath1 .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge - invariant lagrangian generally contains the linear term of vector superfield ( the fi term  @xcite ) with the coefficient @xmath64 , and the d component is then modified as @xmath65 the formulas given below are valid in the presence of the fi term .",
    "the u(1 ) transformation acts on @xmath1 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an infinitesimal parameter , and the u(1 ) gauge invariance of the ( super)potential leads to @xmath68 the field derivatives of this identity are also satisfied ; @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are not summed over .",
    "they are rewritten by using the derivatives of the d component , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , as @xmath74 other field identities can be obtained with various contractions , e.g. , @xmath75    on the vacuum , the stationary conditions impose additional constraints between f and d terms : @xmath76 by multiplying @xmath77 , @xmath33 , @xmath78 and taking the summation over @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath79 where we have used the field identities given above .",
    "the last relation means an important fact that the d term gives a non - vanishing contribution to the scalar potential only if some f terms of u(1)-charged multiplets are non - vanishing . as seen below",
    ", this result is useful to classify and analyze the models with f and d terms .",
    "the susy vacuum has the vanishing scalar potential , that is , all of f and d - flatness conditions are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "@xmath80 thus susy - breaking models with f and d terms are classified into two categories .",
    "we call a model is in the first class when there is no solution satisfying all the f - flatness conditions at the same time",
    ". the second class of models has a solution of the f - flatness conditions but that is destabilized by the d - term potential , which causes susy breaking .",
    "as mentioned above , the d - term effect appears only if @xmath81 is non - vanishing at the vacuum .",
    "thus the above two classes are all possible situations leading to susy breaking .    for susy",
    "breaking , only f terms are effective in the first class of models , and the combination of f and d terms is important in the second class .",
    "we will study the first and second classes of models in the subsections [ subsec:1class ] and [ subsec:2class ] , respectively .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : class ] .",
    "the third and fourth columns are our main results in this paper .",
    "the scalar potential in the first class of models turns out to have a runaway direction no matter whether the fi term is added or not , and thus this class can not be applied to phenomenology as it stands . for the second class , susy is broken if a proper fi term is introduced , and it would be useful for model building such as gauge mediation .",
    ".classification of susy - breaking models with f and d terms .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     as mentioned before , the non - vanishing d term requires charged f terms and then implies two pairs of vector - like chiral multiplets as the minimal set of messengers .",
    "we have the superpotential for the messenger fields , @xmath82 when the messenger mass scales are such that @xmath83 , the vacuum ( [ eq : model - min ] ) remains stable and the standard - model gauge group is unbroken . as a result",
    ", the susy - breaking f terms are still given by ( [ eq : model - fd ] ) and the bosonic mass - squared matrix for the messengers becomes @xmath84 for a small susy breaking @xmath85 , the gaugino mass @xmath86 in the visible sector is generated through the one - loop diagrams ( figure  [ fig : gaugino ] ) and evaluated as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the gauge coupling of the standard model group and @xmath89 denotes the dynkin index for the messenger representation @xmath90 . while the diagrams in figure  2 are expressed in terms of the mass insertion method , the result of gaugino mass ( [ eq : gaugino ] ) is easily shown to be independent of it and exact in the leading order .",
    "the result explicitly shows that , in susy - breaking models with both f and d terms , one can indeed circumvent the argument in  @xcite and generate gaugino masses at the one - loop order of gauge mediation .",

    "in this paper we have systematically studied the susy - breaking models with f and abelian d terms .",
    "the analysis has been performed with the canonical khler form and the tree - level scalar potential .",
    "the models are classified under the condition whether there exist a f - flatness solution or not .",
    "the first class of models has no solution for the f - flatness conditions , i.e.  f - term susy breaking , and the second one has a solution which is destabilized by the d term in the full potential .    in the first class of models",
    ", there exists a pseudo - moduli direction in the f - term scalar potential as studied in  @xcite .",
    "this direction could be lifted in the full scalar potential by a non - vanishing d term with finite values of scalar fields .",
    "we have however shown that there is a runaway direction in the full potential and the d term goes to zero . in the second class of models ,",
