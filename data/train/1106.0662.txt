    "<S> the bulk magnetic properties of the new quasi - one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet , cucro@xmath0 , were characterized by magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity , optical spectroscopy , epr and dielectric capacitance measurements and density functional evaluations of the intra- and interchain spin exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we found type - ii multiferroicity below the nel temperature of 8.2(5 )  k , arising from competing antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath2 ) intra - chain spin exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> experimental and theoretical results indicate that the ratio @xmath1/@xmath2 is close to 2 , putting cucro@xmath0 in the vicinity of the majumdar - ghosh point .      </S>",
    "<S> ferroelectricity driven by magnetic ordering in so - called type - ii multiferroics exhibits a high potential for technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> switching ferroelectric polarization by a magnetic field or magnetization by an electric field offers unprecedented applications in modern energy - effective electronic data storage technology.@xcite however , the link of magnetic order and ferroelectricity in type - ii multiferroics still remains an intriguing question.@xcite to elucidate this issue , lately much attention has been focused on the magnetic and magnetoelectric ( me ) properties of quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) quantum chain systems , which exhibit incommensurate cycloidal magnetic ordering.@xcite such systems lose inversion symmetry and appear to be suitable candidates for multiferroicity . </S>",
    "<S> incommensurate spin - spiral magnetic ordering occurs in magnetic systems consisting of 1d chains when the intrachain nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) spin exchange interactions ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) are spin - frustrated , as found for compounds with cux@xmath5 ribbon chains made up of cux@xmath0 plaquettes , where x is a suitable anion , e.g. oxygen or a halide . </S>",
    "<S> current examples include licuvo@xmath0 , nacu@xmath5o@xmath5 , cucl@xmath5.@xcite it is typical that the cu - x - cu superexchange @xmath3 is ferromagnetic ( fm ) , the cu - x@xmath6x - cu super - superexchange @xmath4 is afm and larger in magnitude.@xcite a cycloidal spin - spiral along a 1d chain induces a macroscopic electric polarization , @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the vector linking the moments residing on adjacent spins @xmath11 and @xmath12.@xcite    in an ongoing effort to identify new quantum spin chain systems which potentially exhibit spiral magnetic order and ferroelectric polarization , we recently focused our attention on compounds crystallizing with ribbon chains , mainly those belonging to the crvo@xmath0 structure - type . the aforementioned structure - type features mo@xmath5 ribbon chains where m is a magnetic 3@xmath13 transition metal . such compounds were recently shown to exhibit exotic magnetic ground - states.@xcite here , we report on the magnetic and me properties of another member of this structure - type , cucro@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our density functional calculations indicate @xmath3 to be about twice as strong as @xmath4 putting cucro@xmath0 in the vicinity of the majumdar - ghosh point for which the ground state can by exactly solved.@xcite this feature makes cucro@xmath0 uniquely exceptional since all of the cux@xmath5 ribbon chain systems investigated so far exhibit fm @xmath3 and afm @xmath4 spin exchange , where @xmath4 is considerably larger in magnitude than @xmath3.@xcite we demonstrate that cucro@xmath0 exhibits long - range afm ordering below @xmath14  8.2  k , which is accompanied by a me anomaly due to possible spin - spiral ordering in the cuo@xmath5 ribbon chains . </S>"
