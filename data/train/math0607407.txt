    "the analysis and control of numerical error in discretized propagation - type equations is of major importance for both theoretical analysis and practical applications .",
    "a huge amount of works has been devoted to the analysis of the numerical errors , its dynamics and its influence on the computed solution ( the reader is referred to classical books , among which @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that existing works are mostly devoted to linear , one - dimensional numerical models , such as the linear advection equation    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a constant uniform advection velocity .",
    "a striking observation is that , despite the tremendous efforts devoted to the analysis of numerical schemes in this simple case , the full exact non - homogeneous error equation has been derived only very recently @xcite .",
    "the two sources of numerical error are the dispersive and dissipative properties of the numerical scheme , which are very often investigated thanks to the spectral von neumann analysis . following this approach ,",
    "a monochromatic wave is used to measure the accuracy of the scheme .",
    "such a tool is very powerful and provides the user with a deep insight into the discretization errors .",
    "but some results coming from practical numerical experiments still remain unexplained , despite the linear character of the discrete numerical model . as an example , let us note the sudden growth of the numerical error for long range propagation reported by zingg @xcite for a large set of numerical schemes , including optimized numerical schemes .",
    "a limiting feature of the usual modal analysis is that it is applied to monochromatic reference solutions .",
    "therefore , dispersive phenomena associated to polychromatic solutions are usually not taken into account .    the present paper deals with the analysis of a linear dispersive mechanism which results in local error focusing , i.e. to a sudden local error growth for polychromatic solutions .",
    "this phenomena is reminiscent of the physical one referred to as the caustic phenomenon in linear dispersive physical models @xcite , and will be referred to as the spurious caustic phenomenon hereafter .",
    "it will be shown that , for some specific values of the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( number ( cfl ) , spurious caustics can exist for some popular finite - difference schemes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical schemes retained for the present analysis are briefly recalled in section [ sec : scheme ] .",
    "main elements of cautic theory of interest for the present analysis are briefly recalled in section [ sec : caust ] .",
    "test schemes are analyzed in section [ sec : analyze - test ] .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the analysis will be restricted to three - level three - point numerical methods .",
    "the extension of the present analysis to other schemes is straightforward . a general finite - differenced version of the linear advection equation ( [ transp ] ) is    @xmath2    with    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mesh size and time step respectively . for the sake of simplicity",

    "is taken under the form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the complex phase , and @xmath8 the real wavenumber . for dispersive waves",
    ", it is recalled that the group velocity @xmath19 is defined as    @xmath20    a caustic is defined as a focusing of different rays in a single location .",
    "the equivalent condition is that the group velocity exhibits an extremum , i.e. there exists at least one wave number @xmath21 such that    @xmath22    the corresponding physical interpretation is that wave packets with characteristic wave numbers close to @xmath21 will pile - up after a finite time and will remain superimposed for a long time , resulting in the existence a region of high energy followed by a region with very low fluctuation level .",
    "the linear continuous model eq .",
    "( [ transp ] ) is not dispersive if the convection velocity @xmath1 is uniform , and therefore the exact solution does not exhibits caustics since the group velocity does not depends on @xmath8",
    ". the discrete solution associated with a given numerical scheme will admit spurious caustics , and therefore spurious local energy pile - up and local sudden growth of the error , if the discrete dispersion relation is such that the condition ( [ eq : caustic ] ) is satisfied .",
    "for a uniform scale - dependent convection velocity , such spurious caustics can exist in polychromatic solutions only , since they are associated to the superposition of wave packets with different characteristic wave numbers .",
    "the general dispersion relation associated with the discrete scheme ( [ eq : discrete - scheme ] ) is    @xmath23    which is a non linear quadratic equation in @xmath24 that can easily been solved .",

    "spurious caustics are associated with characteristic lines given by    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    we now illustrate the caustic phenomenon considering the two following sinusoidal wave packets :    @xmath31 \\,\\,\\ , , \\,\\,\\ , u_2=e^{\\,-\\alpha\\ , ( x - x_0 ^ 2-c\\,t)^2}\\,\\text{cos}\\,[\\,k_2\\,(x - x_0 ^ 2-c\\,t)\\,]\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 ) .",

    "( [ transp ] ) , the initial field is passively advected at speed @xmath1 , while , if the advection speed is scale - dependent ( as in numerical solutions ) , the two packets will travel at different speeds , leading to the rise of discrepancies with the constant - speed solution .",
    "another dispersive error is the shape - deformation phenomenon : due to numerical errors , the exact shape of the wave packets will not be exactly preserved .",
    "this secondary effect will not be considered below , since it is not related to the existence of spurious caustics .",
    "the spurious caustic will appear if the two wave packets happen get superimposed . during the cross - over , the @xmath35 norm of the error ( defined as the difference between the constant - speed solution and the dispersive one ) will exhibit a maximum .",
