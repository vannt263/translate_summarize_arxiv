    "@xcite for the 2d superconductor in the superclean limit where there is only one impurity inside the vortex core , the energy dissipation due to the landau - zener transition between levels has been evaluated .",
    "the energy transfer takes place when the impurity passes through the `` dangerous region '' , where many landau - zener transitions contributing to the dissipation .",

    "the parametric level statistics for the energy spectra under various external perturbations provide a new perspective of transport properties in disordered quantum systems such as metallic grains or quantum dots .",
    "the thouless formula which relates the conductance to an equilibrium quantity such as level curvatures gave the first clue to investigations of universal behaviors of level statistics .",
    "@xcite the random matrix theory ( rmt ) and its classification of distributions of level spacing ( wigner - dyson statistics ) , which plays a role of a finger - print also for quantum chaotic systems , supplies a powerful tool for the study of disordered systems in the framework of level dynamics .  @xcite    there have been both theoretical and numerical studies within the framework of the rmt for the level dynamics of the disordered systems such as an ring subject to the aharonov - bohm flux and non - interacting electrons in background potentials .",
    "@xcite for the quantum chaotic systems , there are experimental studies of the microwave billiards where the gaussian distribution of level velocities has been observed .",
    "@xcite the motivation of the current study is to investigate the universal behavior of the level velocities for low energy excitation spectra inside a moving vortex core dragged through a layered superconductor over a wide region from moderately clean to dirty phase . in the presence of disorder ,",

    "@xcite    in section ii , we investigate the universal distribution of the level velocities for the quasiparticle spectra within the moving vortex core for different regimes which are characterized by the parameter @xmath16 ( or the number of impurities within the core @xmath17 ) , with constant vortex velocity @xmath9 .",
    "we observe that in the case of @xmath18 the gaussian distribution of level velocities is observed . in the clean case ,",
    "non - gaussian distribution with an enhanced peak at @xmath19 which is the characteristic of the systems with localized wave - functions  @xcite is obtained .    in the diffusive time - evolution of energy spectrum within the core , the vortex velocity @xmath9 plays an essential role .",

    "@xmath84 @xmath85 , the non - gaussian behavior is found .",
    "we obtain a sharp peak at @xmath86 which is similar to the result of the microwave experiment for the case when the local level dynamics are concerned .",
    "@xcite this non - gaussian behavior suggests that the wave functions for the scattering quasiparticles in this regime is still localized .",
    "we evaluate the evolution of the wave function @xmath87 from the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 or equivalently consider time evolution of the coefficient matrix @xmath38 which depends on time . @xmath90",

    "we investigate the time evolution of @xmath96 which is expressed in the basis @xmath97 of the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath98 : @xmath99    as the vortex moves at a constant velocity @xmath9 , the time - dependent spectrum shows diffusive time - evolution .",
    "this is the characteristic behavior which suggests that consecutive landau - zener transitions occur incoherently .",
    "the energy transfer takes place at the points called avoided crossings , where the separation between levels is much less than the mean level spacing @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the quantum interference term in the transition probability between the consecutive levels can be ignored .",
    "the full quantum coherent time - evolution , however , leads to localization in energy space .",
    "the condition for this assumption is that many landau - zener transitions contribute to the diffusion , so we may take enough statistical average .  @xcite    thus the occupation probability @xmath100 spreads diffusively as time . following ref .",
    ", we define the probability distribution @xmath101 as @xmath102 @xmath101 is averaged over samples ( over different configurations of initial impurity sites ) , and/or over many initial states @xmath92 .",
    "the diffusive behavior of @xmath103 for small @xmath104 is expected to be linearly dependent on time , @xmath105 solving the time dependent schrdinger equation numerically , we investigate the dependence of the diffusion constant @xmath106 on the rate of change of the external perturbation , i.e. on vortex velocity @xmath9 .    the diffusive behavior is also dependent on the smoothed density of states @xmath107 . in this study",
    "we assume that @xmath107 is constant as @xmath108 where @xmath10 is the mean level spacing .",
    "there are two different regimes which are characterized by the small @xmath9 or the large @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the calculation of the diffusion constant @xmath106 for the levels far from the fermi energy reveals the nonlinear behavior of the energy dissipation of quasi - particles inside the vortex core in the low @xmath9 regime .",
    "in fig.3 we plot the result for the clean phase @xmath84 and the dirty phase @xmath109 for various values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the initial state is @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively near the hump of @xmath51 plot for @xmath114 case which is shown by the insets .",
    "the horizontal axis is the rescaled vortex velocity @xmath115 . in the calculation of the numerical solution of eq.([eq : ts ] ) , the discrete time step is taken as @xmath116 and the sample averaging has been done over @xmath117 different initial configurations of the impurities .",
    "the gradient of the dotted line which is the least square fit is @xmath118 .",
    "we find that @xmath119 where @xmath120 for small @xmath9 from the fit .",
    "since the vortex velocity is written as @xmath121 , this result is consistent with the behavior of the dissipative part of the current density @xmath122 which is obtained in ref .",
    "as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the distance from the `` dangerous region '' to the vortex center and @xmath125 is the flux quantum .",
    "this formula is valid for @xmath126 and in the super - clean limit @xmath127 case . since @xmath51 is suppressed with the decrease of @xmath16 ( or increase of @xmath17 )",
    ", the random matrix prediction is irrelevant as well as in the large @xmath17 case for this low @xmath9 regime as expected .",
    "we also note that for larger values of @xmath9 , we obtain larger values of @xmath128 in all dirty cases of @xmath129 and @xmath130 for which we have done the calculation .    in the meanwhile for the large @xmath9 regime",
    "the random matrix theory predicts the diffusion constant @xmath106 for the perturbed hamiltonian whose matrix elements are taken from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( this is the relevant for the current study ) as @xmath131 where @xmath51 is given by eq.([c0 ] ) and @xmath132 .",
    "the vortex damping coefficient @xmath133 is defined as @xmath134 where l.h.s is the rate of the energy dissipation inside the core and @xmath133 is related to the dissipative conductivity as @xmath135 . from the quasi - classical result in the @xmath18 case , the damping coefficient @xmath133 is given by  @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the density of electrons .",
    "thus the random matrix theory predicts  @xcite @xmath138 in fig.4 we plot @xmath51 v.s .",
    "@xmath16 for various @xmath9 values . in the large @xmath9 case",
    "the relation @xmath139 is explicitely observed .",
    "in this study we have investigated numerically for the universal behavior of the distribution of the rescaled level velocities for the excitation spectra within the moving vortex core in layered superconductors . in the dirty phase where @xmath18 we obtain the gaussian distribution consistent with the result of the theoretical study for the nonlinear @xmath140 model in the various disordered quantum systems .",
    "contrary to this , the non - gaussian behavior which is considered as the characteristic property which manifests the localization of wave functions inside the core is observed within the clean phase @xmath141 .    as to the energy dissipation within the core due to the landau - zener transition between levels which occurs at the points called `` avoided crossings '' , the nonlinear dependence of the @xmath13 on the external perturbation ( the vortex velocity ) is investigated .",
    "this is explicitly related to the nonlinear @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristics in the mixed state in low temperature region .",
    "the dissipation properties are classified into three different regimes characterized by two parameters , the number of impurities inside the core @xmath17 ( or equivalently the inverse of @xmath142 ) , and the vortex velocity @xmath9 .",
    "case i)large @xmath9 and large @xmath17 regime ; in this regime the prediction of the rmt is valid and at the same time the behavior becomes consistent with those obtained from the approach within the kubo - greenwood formula .",
    "case ii)small @xmath9 and large @xmath17 regime ; in this regime the nonlinear behavior of the @xmath13 is observed . since the variance of the scaled level velocity @xmath51 is suppressed as the increase of @xmath17 ,",
    "the random matrix theoretical result is irreverent in this regime no matter how @xmath17 becomes large .",
    "however , we consider that a crossover behavior for the dissipation properties within the core should exist in this regime , which has been found both theoretically and numerically in the case of the density of states . thus the third regime should be the crossover regime denoted as iii)large @xmath17 and moderately large @xmath9 regime .",
    "we consider the result of large @xmath143 values which are obtained in fig .",
    "4 in large @xmath9 case implicitly manifest this crossover behavior .",
    "the crossover properties in this regime from the super - clean result of larkin - ovchinikov @xcite to the dirty case where rmt result should become valid is the issue of future study .",
