    "then , fringe patterns are recorded by varying the analyzed polarization in the single - photon site on the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere , and keeping fixed the analyzed polarization in the @xmath8 mode .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of the opa device is given by @xmath11 .",
    "in this collinear configuration , the _ quantum injected _ optical parametric amplifier ( qiopa ) acts as an _ optimal phase - covariant cloning machine _ @xcite , thus performing the optimal quantum cloning process for all single photon states belonging to the equatorial plane of the polarization bloch sphere , defined as @xmath12 . for all equatorial basis",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian presents the same form : @xmath13 .",
    "the overall micro - macro state after the amplification process reads : @xmath14 the output multiphoton states @xmath15 , where @xmath16 labels the injection of single - photon state with equatorial polarization , is given by the following expression : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 nonlinear gain of the amplifier .",
    "hereafter , the state @xmath22 labels a fock state with @xmath23 photons with @xmath24 polarization and @xmath25 photons with @xmath26 polarization . for a detailed discussion on the properties of such states we refer to refs.@xcite .",

    "we focus our analysis on the exploited entanglement criterion , obtained as the extension of a spin - based criterion for a bipartite microscopic - microscopic system @xcite .",
    "first , the criterion and its experimental implementation is introduced in details , including an analysis of the regions of the system s hilbert space filtered by the detection strategy and a numerical analysis of the effects of a lossy process .",
    "then , the assumptions on the source necessary for the validity of the test are discussed .",
    "for a two - photon state @xmath32 , defined on two different modes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the entanglement is demonstrated by applying the following criterion . for any separable state ,",

    "in particular , we addressed a specific joint microscopic , i.e. composed by a single particle , and macroscopic system based on optical parametric amplification of an entangled photon pair .",
    "a first experimental entanglement test on this system has been recently reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we analyzed in details the conclusions that can be drawn on this experiment .",
    "the adopted entanglement criterion in that paper allowed to infer the presence of entanglement after the amplification process before losses in the detection apparatus .",
    "the validity of the test however requires a specific assumption on the system that generates the micro - macro pair .",
    "an a priori knowledge of the source is necessary in order to exclude a class of separable states that can reproduce the obtained experimental results .",
    "one of the reason for the necessity of this assumption is given by the exploited detection strategy , which presents the feature of a povm with an inconclusive outcome which depends on the measurement basis .",
    "such problem has been recently investigated in ref.@xcite within the context of a nonlocality test in macroscopic systems . in that paper",
    "it was shown that a bell test based on a generalized dichotomic measurement , i.e. with an inconclusive outcome , allows to exclude only a class of local hidden variables ( lhv ) models .",
    "a more general approach to the micro - macro entanglement problem in the investigated system is addressed in the rest of the paper .",
    "we discussed different entanglement criteria which do not require any supplementary assumption on the source , and applied these approaches to the micro - macro system based on optical parametric amplification .",
    "we first derived a general bound for an entanglement criterion based on dichotomic operators .",
    "then , an approach based on deliberate attenuation of the multiphoton field to the single - photon regime , already introduced in ref.@xcite , has been applied to our system .",
    "this analysis allowed us to show that a fraction @xmath0 of the original entanglement of the entangled photon pair exists even in presence of losses , where @xmath0 is proportional to the number of particles that survive the lossy process .",
    "as a further perspective , the system based on parametric amplification can lead to the investigation of entanglement in a bipartite macroscopic macroscopic system @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge support by the `` futuro in ricerca '' project hyteq , and progetto dateneo of sapienza universit di roma .",
    "in this appendix we demonstrate the inequality of eq.([eq : general_criterion ] ) , which gives a generalized bound for an entanglement test in a micro - macro bipartite system and dichotomic measurements .",
    "the proof is divided into two parts .",
    "first , a general treatement of dichotomic measurements is applied to the derivation of an entanglement criterion with no auxiliary assumption on the system under investigation .",
    "then , the obtained results are applied to a micro - macro scenario .",
    "the density matrix of a separable state , composed by two subsystems @xmath165 and @xmath166 , can be written as : @xmath167 we restrict our attention to the set of dichotomic measurements , i.e. @xmath111 valued upon each subsystem @xmath168 and @xmath169 respectively .",
    "the average value of a generic measurement operator @xmath170 is given by @xmath171 , where the superscript @xmath172 refers to a specific choice of the operator @xmath173 .",
    "the average value of the @xmath174 component of the decomposition of the density matrix reads : @xmath175 the average value @xmath176 can then be reexpressed as : @xmath177 the following inequality holds : @xmath178 since @xmath179 .",
    "the sum of the average value over three different operators @xmath173 , where @xmath180 , is given by the following expression : @xmath181 by definition ( [ eq : visibility_i ] ) , we obtain for the @xmath174 component of the decomposition for a separable state : @xmath182 since @xmath183 the following inequality holds : @xmath184 hence for a generic separable state the following inequality holds : @xmath185 where the @xmath186 term is evaluated over the density matrix @xmath187 for subsystem @xmath165 .",
    "the latter can be always decomposed as : @xmath188 where the set @xmath189 of probabilities satisfied the normalization condition @xmath190 .",
    "we can then derive the following inequality : @xmath191 substituting this result in eq.([eq : separable_inequality_intermediate ] ) , by exploiting the normalization conditions for the coefficients @xmath192 and @xmath193 we obtain , due to convexity the following inequality for all bipartite separable states : @xmath194 where the maximization is performed over all possible states of system @xmath165 .",
    "we now specialize the result of previous section in the microscopic - macroscopic states , i.e. when system @xmath165 is a single spin-@xmath195 particle .",
    "let us make a specific choice for the measurement operators @xmath196 .",
    "for a single spin-@xmath195 particle , we choose the pauli operators @xmath197 .",
    "hereafter , we remove the subscript @xmath165 in all the equations for simplicity of notation .",
    "the entanglement criterium ( [ eq : entanglement_criterium_separable ] ) for this choice of the system and operators then reads : @xmath198 we now need to maximize the righthand side of the latter equation over all possible choices of single particle states @xmath199 . by applying the lagrange multiplier method",
    ", the upper bound for the average of the pauli operators reads : @xmath200 finally , we can write the following inequality for the joint microscopic - macroscopic system : @xmath201"
