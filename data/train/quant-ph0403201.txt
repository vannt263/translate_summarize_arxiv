    "the squeezed state is a nonclassical state , which has been discovered for a long time ( see , e.g. , a recent review @xcite and references therein ) . besides recognized potential applications in detecting extremely weak forces , squeezed states have recently attracted much more attention in the newly emerging field of quantum information and quantum computation . by means of squeezed states schemes for teleportation of continuous quantum variables @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , entanglement distribution @xcite , etc .",
    "have been proposed and some of them have been realized .",
    "the original squeezed state @xcite has been generalized to different types of higher - order .",
    "one type of higher - order amplitude squeezing is suggested by hong and mandel @xcite .",
    "another qualitatively different type is introduced by hillery @xcite which is then developed further by several authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hong - mandel type higher - order amplitude squeezing has been investigated in the fan - state @xmath12 which is introduced in @xcite as a linear superposition of @xmath8 @xmath8-quantum nonlinear coherent states @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite in a phase - locked manner .",
    "since there are states that exhibit hong - mandel type squeezing but not hillery - type one and vice versa @xcite , we would like to examine in this paper whether the hillery - type @xmath0-th power amplitude squeezing is possible and , if it is , how it behaves in the same fan - state .",
    "the normalized fan - state is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath4 is in general an arbitrary real nonlinear operator - valued function ( in particular , it may be that @xmath9 ) of @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath22^{2 } } ,   \\label{e1}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 and the @xmath8-quantum nonlinear coherent state is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 a fock state .",

    "a qed - based scheme to generate the fan - state with @xmath9 which concerns radiation field in a cavity has been proposed in @xcite . for @xmath69 the expectation values @xmath70 and",

    "it is clear that , along the directions @xmath110 and @xmath111 we have @xmath112 signifying negativity of @xmath113 i.e. squeesing takes place . along the directions @xmath114 and @xmath115 however , the inequality @xmath116 holds .",
    "that implies @xmath117 i.e. no squeesing occurs .",
    "since the difference between the solid curve and the dashed circle along @xmath110 ( and @xmath118 ) is smaller than that along @xmath114 ( and @xmath119 ) , the squeezing ( stretching ) gives rise to a shorter ( longer ) wing in fig .",

    "simultaneous squeezing along the same two directions may also result with appropriate values of @xmath49 but the squeezing degree is much lower than that in the case with @xmath124    for @xmath125 and @xmath126 we have obtained explicitly @xmath127+a(\\xi",

    "in general @xmath4 is a nonlinear function of the boson number of a field .",

    "in this specific physical system the function @xmath4 and the quantity @xmath49 are determined by @xmath146    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the @xmath149-th generalized polynomial in @xmath53 for parameter @xmath145 , @xmath150 is the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath151 with @xmath152 the phase of the driving laser which is resonant with ( detuned to the @xmath8-th red sideband of ) the electronic transition of the trapped ion , and @xmath153 are the rabi frequencies . as followed from eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) , in this realistic system the function @xmath4 as well as the magnitude of @xmath49 can be controlled by adjusting the parameters of the driving lasers ( through @xmath154 , @xmath153 ) and/or the trapping potential ( through @xmath155 ) .",
    "this provides an experimental means to tailor a fan - state on demand . as for",
    "the question  which power @xmath0 might give rise to squeezing for a given @xmath156 it is not affected by the concrete form of the function @xmath4 since in fact this question depends merely on the property ( [ j ] ) of the @xmath157 as argued in the preceding section .",
    "this means that independent of @xmath4 the @xmath0-th power amplitude squeezing is possible for @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160 however , squeezing actually arises only in certain ranges of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for each chosen value of @xmath155 there exists a critical @xmath163 such that squeezing takes place when @xmath164 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 which plots @xmath165 for @xmath166 and @xmath167 as a function of @xmath168 : @xmath169 .",
    "the number of squeezing directions is determined in the same way as for @xmath9 , i.e. squeezing if it exists is observed simultaneously and equally maximal at @xmath8 directions .",
    "it is worthy to emphasize that the number of simultaneous squeezing directions is dictated only by @xmath5 but not by @xmath170 an interesting fact that can be justified from the symmetry property of the fan - state .",
    "the figure of merit of the case @xmath10 in comparison with @xmath9 is that we can manage the squeezing directions by controlling the physical parameters of the system under consideration .",
    "namely , we could control @xmath150 and @xmath49 so that @xmath171 to have @xmath8 squeezing directions determined by    @xmath172    or , if needed , we could chose @xmath150 and @xmath49 so that @xmath173 to make squeezing along the other directions determined by    @xmath174    transparently , the squeezing directions determined by eqs .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) are  rotated \" by @xmath175 relative to each other . in other words , by adjusting the system driving parameters we are able to interchange the direction of squeezing and stretching if we like .",
    "we have dealt with the hillery - type @xmath0-power amplitude squeezing in the fan - state @xmath176 eq .",
    "( [ fan ] ) , for both @xmath9 and @xmath177 independent of @xmath4 we find out that for a given @xmath5 squeezing may occur within a certain range of @xmath11 for powers @xmath0 that are a multiple of @xmath178 the remarkable feature in the fan - state is that whenever squeezing exists it arises simultaneously and equally in @xmath8 directions , as opposed to conventional states in which squeezing can be observed only along one direction .",
    "while the number of squeezing directions is fixed to @xmath8 for a given @xmath76 these directions themselves can be rotated by adjusting the physical system parameters when @xmath10 as demonstrated in this work in the ion trap context .",
    "though it can be hoped , it seems premature to see that the multidirectional character of squeezing might find an actual application in practice in general or in quantum information processing in particular .",
    "for example , it is known that for quantum continuous variables teleportation @xcite the necessary resource , i.e. the two - mode squeezed entangled state , is produced by superimposing on a beamsplitter two single - mode squeezed states whose squeezing directions must be perpendicular to each other . yet , as at present it remains unknown what happens and what are the benefits if one or both of the superimposed states would exhibit squeezing in more than one direction .",
    "such kinds of work are exciting and do deserve further efforts ."
