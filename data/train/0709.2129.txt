    "the situation is analogous to hydrogen atom in ordinary mechanics , where classically the electron is expected to in - spiral towards the proton leading to a singularity .",
    "this behavior is cured when quantum mechanics is taken into account leading to a stable non - singular hydrogen atom .",
    "in general relativity , two of the most relevant forms of singularities are the big - bang cosmological singularity , as well as black - hole singularities .",
    "a central question to be answered by any quantum theory of gravity is whether these singularities are regulated by incorporating quantum effects .",
    "furthermore , if a quantum theory of gravity were to resolve the classical singularities , it would be of paramount interest as to what replaces them dynamically .    a leading candidate theory of quantum gravity is known as loop quantum gravity ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "the application of loop quantum gravity techniques to cosmological models is known as loop quantum cosmology  @xcite which has led to a resolution of the big - bang singularity , replacing it with a big - bounce for homogeneous and isotropic models  @xcite .",
    "these results provide tantalizing first hints that loop quantum gravity may indeed provide the singularity resolution hoped for in a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "thus the next step is to consider loop quantum gravity for the black hole scenario .",
    "the simplest first step in considering loop quantum black holes consists of examining the interior of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "there , the temporal and radial coordinates flip roles , and the interior becomes a kantowski - sachs cosmological model whereby the metric components are homogeneous and only time dependent .",
    "the interior therefore can be quantized in a similar fashion as loop quantum cosmology leading to the possibility that the singularity is resolved as in the cosmological case .",
    "the loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior has been initially developed in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there , the quantization indicates that the quantum einstein equations are non - singular in a similar way loop quantum cosmology was originally shown to be non - singular  @xcite .",
    "however , the question of what replaces the black hole singularity is not answered .",
    "therefore , we attempt to provide an answer as to what dynamics are predicted from the loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior .",
    "initial attempts in this direction are given in  @xcite which is based on the quantum einstein equations of the original quantization of  @xcite . however , this quantization is the direct analog of the original formulations of loop quantum cosmology which have been shown to not have a good semi - classical limit  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a crucial parameter in the construction of the hamiltonian constraint operator is taken to be a constant in the early constructions and it is this assumption that can spoil the semi - classical limit in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "an improved quantization of loop quantum cosmology whereby the parameter is assumed to explicitly depend on the scale factor has been applied in  @xcite and leads to the correct semi - classical behavior as well as more physically sensible quantum corrections to the standard cosmological dynamics .    in this paper , we consider the improved quantization scheme of loop quantum cosmology applied to the loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior .",
    "we will consider the resulting modifications to the classical interior by examining effective semi - classical equations that incorporate quantum effects . while we do not have a complete handling of the physical sector of the quantum theory owing to its complexity",
    ", the effective semi - classical description is intended to be an approximate shortcut to the physical predictions of the quantum theory . in the framework of the effective description",

    "the second corresponds to the nariai solution which will be of relevance when we discuss the modified quantum dynamics .",

    "on the other hand if we consider a coordinate rescaling of @xmath18 , @xmath19 is correspondingly rescaled such that the ratio @xmath32 is left invariant .",
    "this implies that a rescaling of @xmath18 does not rescale the value of @xmath29 .",
    "note that this point was mistaken in  @xcite where it was mentioned that a rescaling of @xmath22 can be accommodated by a rescaling in @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the classical coordinate gauge freedoms , there is an additional gauge in the loop setup pertaining to the choice in restriction of the spatial integration leading to the @xmath19 parameter . from the definitions of @xmath29 and @xmath33 in  , it is easy to see that if we choose a different size of @xmath19 then this will rescale the value of @xmath29 and @xmath33 and hence in terms of the schwarzschild solution , @xmath22 will rescale accordingly .",
    "the loop quantization is based on the phase - space variables @xmath34 all of which are invariant under a coordinate rescaling of @xmath18 .",
    "the quantization is thus manifestly invariant under the first gauge transformation .",
    "however the quantum effects in principle can depend on the second gauge freedom which does not appear classically .",
    "this will be manifested in the quantum dynamics by a dependence of the physical results on the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "any dependence of the quantum physics on this gauge freedom implies the need for additional input into the theory ( namely the specification of the value of @xmath22 ) which must be done by hand .",
    "we will show that the improved quantization we focus on in section [ gooddelta ] will be independent of @xmath22 and hence will not require additional input of its value .      an additional classical solution that will be of relevance to the discussion of the effective dynamics is the nariai solution  @xcite .",

    "moreover , the geodesic equation is simple to interpret because of the simple relation between the coordinate parameter @xmath4 and the two - sphere radius determined from @xmath28 since we have @xmath71 .",
    "however , when we come to the quantum dynamics , the relationship between the coordinate parameter @xmath4 and @xmath28 will become complicated and we will no longer be interested in the behavior of the coordinate parameter @xmath4 as a function of proper time",

    "we will see that the loop quantum dynamics imply a minimum value of the two - sphere radius @xmath28 and hence the solutions are non - singular with an in - falling particle never reaching the classical singularity .",
    "in attempting to ascertain the quantum corrections to the classical behavior implied by the loop quantization , we will work in an effective semi - classical description that leads to modifications of the classical hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the effective description is motivated from the construction of the quantum hamiltonian operator , although a more rigorous understanding of the quantum dynamics would require more sophisticated machinery .",
    "our aim here is to describe the expected dominant corrections arising from the quantum theory and as such , there is room for additional corrections that could modify some of the results presented here .",
    "evidence that the effective theory we describe provides an accurate description of the quantum dynamics is given by homogeneous and isotropic loop quantum cosmology with a massless scalar field with or without a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "the main quantum correction arises from the fact that in the loop quantization no direct operators exist corresponding to the connection components @xmath52 and @xmath33 .",
    "instead , the quantization proceeds as in loop quantum gravity by considering holonomies of the connection .",
    "the holonomies roughly consist of exponential terms like @xmath76 with @xmath77 corresponding to the _ edge length _ of the holonomy .",
    "the end result in the effective hamiltonian is to replace the classical @xmath52 terms in the hamiltonian  , with @xmath78 terms for instance .",

    "the classical limit is recovered by taking the @xmath80 limits .",
    "the @xmath79 parameters , arising from the holonomy edge lengths , are a measure of the quantum discreteness arising from the loop quantization .    in the original loop quantization of the schwarzschild interior  @xcite",

    "the solution to this issue presented in that article is to relax the assumption that the @xmath81 factors are constant and instead consider them to be functions of the triad variables .",
    "the precise prescription given leads to the non - constant factor labeled @xmath83 which varies inversely with the scale factor of the universe and with this behavior the correct semi - classical limit is achieved @xcite .",
    "thus our goal will be to consider the effective dynamics with a quantization scheme arising from the improved prescription for loop quantum cosmology given in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath79 factors will depend explicitly on the triad components @xmath29 and @xmath28 .",

    "we merely repeat the results that are relevant to our discussion .      with the considerations of the previous discussion",

    "a symmetric solution can be constructed by fine tuning the value of @xmath22 .    as we have seen in the figures , the mass parameter @xmath6 controls the mass of the first black hole whereas @xmath22 controls the mass of the second black hole .",
    "this suggests that in the effective quantum theory , @xmath22 would not be regarded as a meaningless constant of integration or a certain choice of gauge . for the constant @xmath81 quantization of the schwarzschild interior spacetime this parameter acquires an important physical meaning , and two different choices",

    "we have also considered the behavior of the kretschmann invariant , the square of the riemann tensor @xmath148 . for the metric  ( [ triadmetric ] ) , written out explicitly , this yield a rather complicated expression .",
    "however , plotting this quantity for our numerical solution also shows that the geometry of the spacetime changes significantly , from the classical schwarzschild like behavior where @xmath149 ( which diverges at @xmath150 ) towards a space of constant curvature , as expected for the nariai type metrics whose form is given by k = 4 ( + ) .",
    "plugging in the theoretical values in   gives an expected value k 124.36 m_^4 which is in good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "furthermore this asymptotic value is independent of the black hole mass .",
    "we find that the quantum effects become appreciable when the kretschmann curvature invariant approaches the planck scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : geodesici ] shows a plot indicating this behavior .",
    "the quantum effects removing the singularity can best be visualized by carter - penrose diagrams , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the classical diagrams for both the schwarzschild and nariai spacetimes are given in figure  [ figa ] .",
    "the quantum effects remove the classical schwarzschild singularity shown as the wavy line at the top of region ii in the carter - penrose diagram and glue the diagram to the shaded region of the nariai diagram .",
    "the resulting diagram of the interior is shown in figure  [ figc ] .",
    "at the level of the effective description we have presented , we have been able to answer the questions posed at the beginning , namely what replaces the singularity in the schwarzschild interior . in all of the quantization schemes",
    "we have discussed , singularity avoidance arises naturally thus providing further evidence that loop quantum gravity successfully resolves the classical black hole singularity .",
    "we have seen two possible replacements for the singularity , one in which quantum effects connect two separate ( non - identical ) black holes resembling a wormhole - like solution . the other solution predicting repulsive gravitational effects leading to an equilibrium two - sphere radius to which an in - falling particle would asymptote .",
    "the results are suggestive but can not be considered as a proof that the lqg resolves the black hole singularity .",
    "the effective equations considered here are not rigorously derived from the quantum theory and thus can only be considered approximations of the quantum dynamics . since understanding the quantum dynamics is difficult , we do not have a complete handle on when the approximation might break down .",
    "as was mentioned however , the effective equations have approximated the quantum dynamics in the models where both can be developed completely , namely the homogeneous and isotropic models of lqc sourced with a massless scalar field .    some initial attempts at constructing semi - classical states for the constant @xmath81 quantization have be made in @xcite and @xcite and it is worthwhile to compare our results with the previous work . in the works cited , numerical instabilities of the difference equation are found which bring into question whether any effective picture is valid near the singularity . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that no proper semi - classical states exist unless the immirzi parameter @xmath138 is less the the accepted value in the lqg literature raising a further question . in this article , our aim has been to probe the improved , non - constant @xmath81 quantization and thus we do not see a direct contradiction .",
    "in particular , the bound on the immirzi parameter depends explicitly on the constant value of @xmath81 and so it is not clear if a bound exists in the improved quantization .",
    "in addition , both papers evolve gaussian semi - classical states with the quantum difference equation which seem to imply that semi - classicality breaks down near the singularity . the numerical results are based on using the triad component @xmath28 as an internal clock , however , our results suggest that @xmath28 bounces and hence would not play the role of a good clock . thus to reconcile our results with those of @xcite",
    ", the numerical evolutions would probably require different initial conditions to incorporate both the expanding and contracting parts of the wave - packets at the initial instance in `` time '' .",
    "this issue is solved in the isotropic case by including a scalar field that plays the role of a global internal clock .",
    "we thus feel that our results are not in conflict with @xcite , and that all of our works requires further development of the quantum dynamics including the specification of a good internal clock , physical inner product , and dirac observables .",
    "additionally , the validity of the kantowski - sachs description of the interior could be questioned .",
    "boundary conditions must be provided for the numerical evolution at the horizon which are prescribed using classical solutions . however , this could be modified when considering a true quantization of the full spacetime .",
    "in particular , the improved quantization scheme described in section  [ gooddelta ] leads to modifications at the horizon which may require input from the full quantization . additionally , by considering the homogeneous interior , we can not probe a realistic collapse scenario .",
    "therefore , an interesting next step would be to apply the techniques described here to the inhomogeneous spherically symmetric quantization .",
    "the results described in  @xcite provide the initial steps at an amenable quantization , though the results presented there are only valid in the exterior . if the results can be extended to cover the whole spacetime , then an effective dynamics analysis could be extended . with this model",
    ", one could analyze a genuine collapse scenario .",
    "we thank abhay ashtekar and roy maartens for valuable discussion .",
    "the work of cgb was supported by research grant bo 2530/1 - 1 of the german research foundation ( dfg ) .",
    "kv is supported by the marie curie incoming international grant m1f1-ct-2006 - 022239 .",
    "here we consider an alternate behavior for the @xmath81 factors that are more heuristically motivated . in the language of",
    "@xcite this corresponds to a lattice refinement model whereby the number of vertices is proportional to the transverse area .",
    "in addition this scheme has been considered in anisotropic bianchi i models in  @xcite .",
    "a stability analysis indicates that this scheme leads to an unstable difference equation  @xcite thus it may not represent a good quantization scheme .",
    "an advantage of this scheme is that the quantum difference equation is much simpler than in the previous one and more amenable to a proper analysis of the true quantum dynamics although the instability of the difference equation could spoil this .    in this scheme",
    "we have the @xmath81 factors behaving as _ b & = & + _ c & = & . again the effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath151 ,        \\label{d1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to equations of motion with lapse @xmath107 & = & c c _ c - 3 + _ c & = & 2 p_c c _ c + & = & - + - - + _ b & = & p_b b _ b -    again we can examine where the quantum corrections are appreciable by determining where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are on the order of one . from the classical behavior ,",
    "both @xmath152 and @xmath153 blow up at the singularity and thus quantum effects are expected there . at the horizon ,",
    "@xmath152 vanishes and @xmath153 is small provided @xmath136 is small .",
    "hence with this quantization scheme , the effects near the horizon are minimal .",
    "the resulting numerical solutions are qualitatively very similar to those obtained for the constant @xmath81 quantization scheme .",
    "as discussed above , the parameter @xmath22 controls the mass of the second black hole in the effective quantum theory which can be tuned to give a symmetric spacetime .",
    "we note that similarly to the other quantization schemes , the singularity is resolved dynamically .",
