    "the existence of neutrinos of @xmath1 ev is strongly motivated by the observation of cosmic rays up to energies of order of @xmath2 ev .",
    "these cosmic ray particles , mainly composed by protons and heavier nuclei , interact in the sources ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) or during their propagation through the intergalactic medium @xcite , producing weakly decaying particles such as pions and kaons that decay into neutrinos .",
    "high energy neutrinos can also be generated as the main product of the decay of superheavy relic particles @xcite .",
    "in general , the flavor content of the flux of astrophysical neutrinos is a function of the neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "one of the main mechanisms that causes the flavor ratio to change is based on the fact that pions and muons produced in the sources lose their energy because of the interaction with the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the pion decay time is shorter than the corresponding one to the muon , and then , at sufficiently high energies , the probability of pion decay , prior to significant energy loss , is larger than the corresponding one to the muon . as a consequence , the flavor ratio at the source changes from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the transition between theses two regimes depends on the characteristics of the source .",
    "therefore , the determination of the flavor content of the flux is of great importance for the understanding of the physical processes that take place in the source .",
    "the flavor information can also be used to study the more fundamental properties of neutrinos and to identify physics beyond the standard model ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "cosmic ray observatories are sensitive to high energy neutrinos .",
    "in particular , there are two different ways to detect them .",
    "the first one consists in observing the development of horizontal air showers produced by the interactions of the neutrinos with the nucleons of the molecules of the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the second one consists in observing the showers produced by the decay of taus generated by the interaction of tau neutrinos that propagate through the interior of the earth @xcite .",
    "horizontal and quasihorizontal neutrino showers as well as earth skimming tau neutrino showers can be observed by using surface detectors or fluorescence telescopes placed over the earth s surface or in space . at present",
    "no astrophysical neutrino has been observed in cosmic ray observatories and then , upper limits on its flux have been obtained @xcite .    in this work",
    "we develop a new technique to discriminate between scenarios with different compositions of electron and tau neutrinos , by using very deep tau and electron neutrino horizontal showers .",
    "this new technique is based on the morphology of the longitudinal profiles of the horizontal neutrino showers that can be observed by means of fluorescence telescopes .",
    "in particular , we study in detail the highest energy region of the neutrino flux that is relevant for space observations with the upcoming orbital fluorescence telescopes like jem - euso @xcite and the proposed super - euso @xcite experiment .",
    "neutrinos can initiate atmospheric air showers when they interact with the nucleons of the air molecules .",
    "the probability that a neutrino interacts in the atmosphere increases with the zenith angle because of the increase of the number of target nucleons .",
    "high energy neutrinos , propagating through the atmosphere , can suffer charge ( cc ) and neutral ( nc ) current interactions .",
    "the cc interactions are the most important for the space observations because in the nc interactions most of the energy is taken by a secondary neutrino that could produce an observable air shower just in case it suffers a subsequent cc interaction .",
    "the observation of the showers produced by the hadronic component resultant from the nc interaction depends on the energy threshold of the telescope . in this work",
    "just the showers initiated by cc interactions are considered .    as a result of a cc interaction , a very high energy lepton , which takes most of the energy of the incident neutrino ,",
    "is generated , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a nucleon , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the hadronic component .",
    "typically , the produced lepton @xmath9 takes @xmath10 of the neutrino energy at @xmath11 ev , and the rest of the energy goes into the hadronic component @xmath8 . in the case of electron neutrino showers ,",
    "the produced electron together with the hadronic component initiate an air shower right after the neutrino interaction . because most of the times the electron takes most of the neutrino energy , the electron neutrino showers have characteristics more similar to the electromagnetic showers than to the hadronic showers ; however , the effects of the hadronic component are not negligible specially for showers developing in dense regions of the atmosphere ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in the case of tau neutrinos , while the hadronic component @xmath8 initiates a low energy shower immediately after the cc interaction ( first bang ) , the tau lepton produced propagates through the atmosphere almost without interacting and then , after a given distance , decays .",
    "the particles produced in the decay initiate a more energetic shower than the first one , producing a second bang .",
    "there are several channels for tau decay which can be classified in three groups @xcite ,    * electromagnetic channel : @xmath12 . * hadronic channel : @xmath13 , where @xmath8 can be pions , kaons , etc . * muonic channels : @xmath14 .",
    "the branching ratios of the electromagnetic , hadronic , and muonic channels are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the tau neutrino showers corresponding to the muonic channel are difficult to observe because of the large decay length of the muons at the energies considered , and then , only the electromagnetic and hadronic channels are relevant for the detection of tau showers . therefore , considering just the electromagnetic and hadronic channels , @xmath18 of the tau neutrino showers are of hadronic origin whereas @xmath19 are of electromagnetic origin .",
    "muon neutrino showers are initiated by the electrons generated in the dominant decay channel of the muons produced in the cc interaction . however , these showers are difficult to observe because of the large decay length of the muon at such high energies , @xmath20 km .",
    "that is why muon neutrino showers are not considered in the subsequent analyses .",
    "electron neutrino showers are simulated following the procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the charge current neutrino - nucleon interaction is simulated by using pythia @xcite , linked with the lhapdf library @xcite , which allows the use of different sets of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the cteq6 @xcite set of pdfs , the most commonly used at the highest energies , is used in this work . note that the use of a different set of pdfs has a small impact on the simulated neutrino showers @xcite .",
    "the secondary particles , produced in the interaction , are used as input in the program conex @xcite ( v2r2.3 ) , in order to simulate the shower development .",
    "the high energy hadronic interaction model used for the shower simulations is qgsjet - ii @xcite .",
    "however , our main results are not strongly dependent on this assumption .",
    "the cc tau neutrino - nucleon interaction and the production of the corresponding tau lepton , are simulated using pythia with the cetq6 set of pdfs .",
    "the decay of the tau is simulated with the program tauola @xcite .",
    "then , the particles produced in the decays are used as input in conex ( with qgsjet - ii ) in order to simulate the shower development .",
    "a library of horizontal neutrino showers is generated by using the simulation chain described above .",
    "the primary energy of the neutrinos ranges from @xmath21 ev to @xmath22 ev in steps of @xmath23 .",
    "the interaction point of the electron neutrinos and the decay of the taus are just above the earth s surface , the densest region of the atmosphere .",
    "note that the injection point is such that the trajectory of the showers starts at the vertical axis of a nadir - pointing orbital telescope at sea level .",
    "therefore , hereafter we denote very deep horizontal ( vdh ) showers to the showers initiated by the interaction of horizontal electron neutrinos or the decay of tau leptons ( generated by the interaction of horizontal tau neutrinos ) , such that the interaction point of the electron neutrinos , or the decay of the tau leptons , is placed at the vertical axis of a nadir - pointing telescope at sea level .",
    "figure [ prof ] shows the longitudinal profiles ( deposited energy per unit of atmospheric depth ) for vdh electron and tau neutrino showers of @xmath24 ev .",
    "the multiple peak structure present in the profiles is caused by the fluctuations introduced by the landau pomeranchuk migdal ( lpm ) effect , which is important for showers dominated by the electromagnetic component .",
    "note that , as can be seen from the figure , the vdh electron neutrino showers are more affected by the lpm effect .",
    "longitudinal profiles for vdh electron and tau neutrino showers of @xmath24 ev.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   longitudinal profiles for vdh electron and tau neutrino showers of @xmath24 ev.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "as mentioned before , vdh neutrino showers present a multipeak structure caused by the fluctuations introduced by the lpm effect . in particular , electron neutrino showers are more affected by this effect because they are dominated by the electromagnetic component .",
    "in contrast , tau showers are less affected by this effect , because @xmath18 of the times the tau decays are of the hadronic type .",
    "therefore , the number of peaks present in a given longitudinal profile should be a good parameter to discriminate between vdh electron and tau neutrino showers .    given a simulated longitudinal profile , the number of peaks and their positions are determined following the procedure described in ref .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ xmaxi ] shows the distribution of the position of the first peak , @xmath25 , found from the beginning of the shower , @xmath26 , for electron and tau neutrino showers of @xmath27 ev .",
    "note that the distribution function of @xmath28 for vdh electron neutrino showers is bivalued and its first peak is located at @xmath29 g @xmath30 , while the second one is centered at @xmath31 g @xmath30 .",
    "the first peak is related to the development of the hadronic component of the cascade , whereas the second one mainly reflects the electromagnetic components of the shower ( see ref .",

    "because of this , the number of vdh tau neutrino showers are suppressed compared with the electron neutrino ones at the higher energies . in particular , the ratio between the number of vdh tau neutrino showers and vdh electron neutrino showers for an incident flux with the same number of electron and tau neutrinos is given by @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the distance in the horizontal direction measured from a point just above the earth s surface , @xmath45 is the probability per unit of length to initiate an horizontal @xmath9-flavor neutrino shower at @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the probability to generate a tau lepton of energy @xmath41 given the cc interaction of a tau neutrino of energy @xmath48 with a nucleon of the atmosphere , @xmath49 g @xmath30 is the mean free path for cc neutrino - nucleon interaction calculated using the cross section of ref .",

    "however , for the case of vdh tau neutrino showers @xmath134 is smaller than the ideal case and the difference increases with the deposited energy .",

    "<S> high energy astrophysical neutrinos carry relevant information about the origin and propagation of cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> they can be created as a by - product of the interactions of cosmic rays in the sources and during propagation of these high energy particles through the intergalactic medium . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of flavor composition in this high energy flux is important because it presents a unique chance to probe our understanding of neutrino flavor oscillations at gamma factors @xmath0 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we develop a new statistical technique to study the flavor composition of the incident neutrino flux , which is based on the multipeak structure of the longitudinal profiles of very deep electron and tau neutrino horizontal air showers . </S>",
    "<S> although these longitudinal profiles can be observed by means of fluorescence telescopes placed over the earth s surface , orbital detectors are more suitable for neutrino observations owing to their much larger aperture . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we focus on the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum relevant for observations with orbital detectors like the planned jem - euso telescope . </S>"
