    "the mathematical modeling of biological networks has focused on the influence of the network structure on the functional properties of the system @xcite .",
    "insights provided by these studies have shown , for example , that structural modules and hierarchical organization in the network are often related to compartmentalization of functional processes @xcite .",
    "this is important since intracellular processes are rarely carried out by individual elements , and often involve the coordinated activity of multiple genes , proteins , and biochemical transformations . because different components may be recruited for different processes , the most fundamental aspect of the dynamics of complex intracellular networks concerns precisely the characterization of the specific parts of the network that are active under given conditions .",
    "recent research focused on the modeling of metabolic networks has shown that typical metabolic states tend to recruit a much larger number of reactions than states that maximize growth rate @xcite .",
    "this counterintuitive property is important in multiple contexts .",
    "for example , it provides a partial explanation for the apparent dispensability of a large fraction of genes in single - cell organisms @xcite , since the genes associated with reactions that become inactive in growth - maximizing states are expected not to be essential .",
    "this also explains why genetic and environmental perturbations that cause growth defect are accompanied by a burst in reaction activity @xcite .",
    "these bursts can be attributed to the transient activation of otherwise inactive reactions that are recruited by the suboptimal states that follow the perturbation @xcite , since such states tend to have a larger number of active reactions .",
    "another important implication concerns the possibility of synthetic rescues @xcite , where the inactivation of one gene can be compensated by the targeted inactivation of other genes .",
    "the inactivation of such rescue genes can thus allow the recovery of lost biological function .",
    "this is possible in part because the rescue genes correspond to genes that would be inactive in an optimal state , so that disabling them helps bring the state of the system closer to the desired optimal state @xcite .",
    "understanding the root causes of the reduced reaction activity in optimal metabolic states is then of significant interest in the characterization and study of cellular metabolism .",
    "focusing on steady - state dynamics , here we use flux - balance based analysis and linear programming techniques to establish rigorous results on the number of reactions that can be active in a given metabolic network .",
    "we derive conditions for a specific reaction to be inactive in all ( sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) or active in almost all ( sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] ) feasible metabolic states .",
    "we also establish bounds for the number of reactions that can be active in states that optimize an arbitrary linear function of reaction fluxes ( sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] ) , which are derived based on the duality principle in linear programming , and we study the uniqueness of the optimal solution for typical linear objective functions ( sec .  [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "finally , we implement numerical simulations in reconstructed _ escherichia coli _ and human metabolic networks , both to compare with the rigorous bounds and to consider nonlinear objective functions ( sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] ) . taken together ,",
    "our results show that the reduced number of active reactions in the optimal states of a linear objective function , including growth rate , are mainly determined by the presence of irreversible reactions in the network .",
    "the irreversibility constraints are shown to play a role also in nonlinear objective functions , such as the aggregated flux and mass flow activity , whose optimal solutions are shown to have a number of active reactions comparable to the corresponding number for linear functions .",
    "we consider time - independent metabolic states , which serve as an appropriate representation of the state of single cells at time scales much shorter than the lifetime of the cells , as well as of the average behavior of a large population of cells at arbitrary time scales in time - invariant conditions . under this",

    ". constraints of the form @xmath7 imposed on the exchange fluxes are used to limit the maximum uptake rates of substrates in the medium .",
    "additional constraints of the form @xmath8 arise for the reactions that are irreversible .",
    "assuming that the cell s operation is mainly limited by the availability of substrates in the medium , we impose no other constraints on the internal reaction fluxes , except for the atp maintenance flux , which is set to a fixed positive value .",
    "these additional constraints can be organized in the form @xmath9 the set of all flux vectors @xmath10 satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : mb ] ) and ( [ eqn : const ] ) defines the _ feasible solution space _ @xmath11 , representing the capability of the metabolic network as a system . because the number of fluxes @xmath12 is larger than the number of metabolic species @xmath13 , system ( [ eqn : mb ] ) is under - determined and @xmath14 is generally high dimensional .",
    "our study is formulated in the context of flux balance analysis  @xcite , which is based on the maximization of a metabolic objective function @xmath15 within the feasible solution space @xmath14 ( the superscript @xmath16 is used to denote transpose ) .",

    "this formulation is also appropriate for the derivation of the rigorous results presented below . in the particular case of growth maximization",
    ", the objective vector @xmath21 is taken to be parallel to the biomass flux , which is modeled as an effective reaction that converts metabolic species into biomass .",

    "theorem [ thm1 ] holds true independently of other constraints because the proof does not involve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : const ] ) .",
    "in particular , the sufficient condition for inactivity applies to any nutrient medium condition and does not depend on the reversibility of the reactions under consideration . in the case of the reconstructed _",

    "[ sec7 ] ) , which includes 922 ( 3328 ) unique internal and transport reactions , a total of 141 ( 475 ) reactions are always inactive in steady states as a result of the condition in theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "the next question of interest concerns the number of reactions that will be active with probability one in typical metabolic states . the stoichiometric constraints @xmath25 define the linear subspace @xmath40 ( the null space of @xmath23 ) , which contains the feasible solution space @xmath14 .",
    "however , the set @xmath14 can possibly be smaller than @xmath41 because of the additional constraints arising from environmental and physiochemical properties ( availability of substrates in the medium , reaction irreversibility , and cell maintenance requirements ) . therefore , @xmath14 may have smaller dimension than @xmath41 .",
    "if we denote the dimension of @xmath14 by @xmath42 , there exists a unique @xmath42-dimensional linear submanifold of @xmath43 that contains @xmath14 , which we denote by @xmath44 .",

    ", it follows that a typical state @xmath47 is non - optimal .",
    "equation ( [ eq : env ] ) will lead to a different number of active reactions for different nutrient medium conditions [ determined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : const ] ) ] , with the general trend that this number will be larger in richer medium conditions . in the case of the _ e.  coli _ ( human ) reconstructed network simulated in glucose minimal medium , as considered here ( see sec .

    "the latter includes the cascading - induced inactivation of some reactions due to the inactivation of different , irreversible reactions .",
    "we now turn to the central part of our study , which concerns the number of reactions that can be active in steady states that optimize a linear function of the metabolic fluxes .",
    "the linear programming problem for finding the flux distribution maximizing a linear objective function can be written in the matrix form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined as follows . if the @xmath22th constraint is @xmath66 , the @xmath22th row of @xmath64 consists of all zeros except for the @xmath38th entry that is @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . if the @xmath22th constraint is @xmath69 , the @xmath22th row of @xmath64 consists of all zeros except for the @xmath38th entry that is @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "a constraint of the type @xmath72 is broken into two separate constraints and represented in @xmath64 and @xmath65 as above .",

    "can be compactly expressed as maximizing @xmath15 in @xmath14 .",
    "the duality principle @xcite expresses that any linear programming problem ( primal problem ) is associated with a complementary linear programming problem ( dual problem ) , and the solutions of the two problems are intimately related .",
    "the dual problem associated with problem   is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the dual variable .",
    "a consequence of the strong duality theorem @xcite is that the primal and dual solutions are related via a well - known optimality condition : @xmath10 is optimal for problem   if and only if there exists @xmath80 such that @xmath81 note that each component of @xmath82 can be positive or zero , and we can use this information to find a set of reactions that are forced to be inactive under optimization , as follows . for any given optimal solution @xmath83 , eq .",

    "otherwise , the reaction may be active or inactive , depending on the choice of an optimal solution .",

    "this is justified since we can obtain @xmath91 from @xmath14 by simply imposing additional equality constraints .",
    "therefore , if we set aside the @xmath116 reactions that are required to be inactive ( including @xmath61 and @xmath62 reactions that are inactive for all @xmath47 ) , all the other reactions are active for almost all @xmath114 . consequently , @xmath118    we can also use theorem  [ thm : optimal ] to further classify those inactive reactions caused by the optimization as due to two specific mechanisms :    1 .   _ irreversibility . _",
    "the irreversibility constraint ( @xmath8 ) on a reaction can be binding ( @xmath53 ) , which directly forces the reaction to be inactive for all optimal solutions .",
    "such inactive reactions are identified by checking the positivity of dual components ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "_ cascading . _",
    "all other reactions that are required to be inactive for all @xmath114 are due to a cascade of inactivity triggered by the first mechanism , which propagates over the metabolic network via the stoichiometric constraints .",
    "these inactive reactions occur in addition to the irreversibility / cascading - induced reaction inactivation identified in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] for typical ( in fact all ) steady states .    in general , a given solution of problem   can be associated with multiple dual solutions .",
    "the set and the number of positive components in @xmath82 can depend on the choice of a dual solution , and therefore the categorization according to these specific mechanisms is generally not unique . for the example problem of fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , it is clear from @xmath119 that three reactions @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are required to be inactive in the optimal state .",

    "this reflects the fact that making @xmath123 under the stoichiometric constraint @xmath124 , along with the irreversibility constraints @xmath125 and @xmath126 , forces @xmath127 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : example](c ) ] .",
    "another possible dual solution is given by @xmath128 which leads to an alternative characterization of the same @xmath91 : @xmath129 categorizing @xmath121 and @xmath122 under irreversibility , and @xmath120 under cascading .",
    "one can indeed see graphically in the projection onto @xmath130-coordinates in fig .",
    "[ fig : example](b ) that the maximization of @xmath99 under the stoichiometric constraint @xmath131 ( which follows from @xmath101 and @xmath25 ) forces the irreversible fluxes @xmath121 and @xmath122 to be zero , which in turn forces @xmath132 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : example](c ) ] .",
    "clearly , one can also characterize the optimal solution space as @xmath133 which corresponds for example to the choice of dual solution given by @xmath134 this leads to the categorization of all three inactive reactions under irreversibility .",
    "thus , we can interpret the non - uniqueness of the categorization as the fact that different sets of triggering inactive reactions can create the same cascading effect on the reaction activity .",
    "the results above are important both because they can be applied to any linear objective function and because a significant fraction of real metabolic reactions are irreversible . in the case of the _ e.  coli _ ( human ) reconstructed network ,",
    "a total of 73.4% ( 65.6% ) of all internal and transport reactions are irreversible .",
    "moreover , a number of other reactions are effectively irreversible because the irreversibility of different reactions in the same pathway constrains them not to run in one of the two directions ; this leads to a total of 94.3% ( 74.9% ) of the reactions whose fluxes are either necessarily nonnegative or necessarily nonpositive in all steady - state solutions . in the case of growth - maximizing states for the conditions considered in our numerical experiments , out of all 922 ( 3328 ) internal and transport reactions in the reconstructed network , a total of 146 ( 106 ) reactions are inactive due to irreversibility constraints , and a total of 114 ( 293 ) other reactions are inactive due to a cascade of reaction inactivation ; some of the irreversible reactions can be assigned to either the first or the second of these two groups .",

    "the lower and upper bounds are 273 ( 113 ) and 339 ( 1180 ) , respectively .",
    "these numbers should be compared with the number 599 ( 1579 ) of reactions that are active in typical , suboptimal states .",
    "this clearly shows that optimal states are necessarily constrained to have a smaller number of active reactions , and that this is due to the presence of irreversible reactions in the network .",
    "another problem of interest concerns the uniqueness of the optimal solutions .",
    "while a number of necessary and/or sufficient conditions for this uniqueness are known  @xcite , we are not aware of any probabilistic statements in the literature addressing this issue .",

    "therefore , the left hand side also has lebesgue measure zero .",
