    "one of the most exciting recent experiments in hadron spectroscopy is the detection of a narrow baryon state from the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath7 or @xmath8 in nuclear reactions induced by photons @xcite or kaons @xcite .",
    "the extracted mass of about 1.54 gev and width of less than 21 - 25 mev are consistent with those of the pentaquark baryon @xmath0 consisting of @xmath9 quarks and predicted in the chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "its existence has also been verified in the skyrme model @xcite , the constituent quark model @xcite , the chiral quark model @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , and the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "although most models predict that @xmath0 has spin 1/2 and isospin 0 , their predictions on @xmath0 parity vary widely .",
    "while the soliton model gives a positive parity and the lattice qcd studies favors a negative parity , the quark model can give either positive or negative parities , depending on whether quarks are correlated or not .",
    "since the quantum numbers of the detected @xmath0 are not yet determined in experiments , studies have therefore been carried out to predict its decay branching ratios based on different assignments of the @xmath0 quantum numbers @xcite .    to evaluate the cross sections for @xmath0 production from these reactions ,",
    "we have employed a hadronic model that is based on gauged su(3 ) flavor symmetric lagrangians with the photon introduced as a u@xmath10(1 ) gauged particle @xcite . the symmetry breaking effects are taken into account phenomenologically by using empirical hadron masses and coupling constants as well as empirical form factors . for the reaction @xmath11 , in which @xmath0 was detected in the saphir experiment at bonn university s elsa accelerator @xcite , the predicted cross section reaches a value of about 40 nb at photon energy @xmath12 gev if the parity of @xmath0 is taken to be positive .",
    "this value is about an order - of - magnitude smaller than the 300 nb measured in the experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the reaction @xmath13 , which corresponds to the one seen in the leps experiment at spring-8 @xcite and the clas experiment at the thomas jefferson national laboratory ( jlab ) @xcite , is predicted to have a peak value of about 280 nb at @xmath14 gev , comparable to that obtained in ref.@xcite using similar hadronic lagrangians .",
    "the much larger cross section for the reaction @xmath13 than that for the reaction @xmath11 is due to coupling of the photon to the virtual @xmath15 accompanied with the produced @xmath0 @xcite , which is absent in the latter reaction .",
    "it was also pointed out in ref.@xcite that if @xmath0 is allowed to couple to @xmath3 with a coupling constant similar to the @xmath16 coupling and if one further includes the photon anomalous parity interactions with kaons , which are responsible for the decay of @xmath17 to @xmath18 , then the cross section for the reaction @xmath11 is increased to about 350 nb , comparable to that quoted in the saphir experiment , although that for the reaction @xmath13 is only somewhat enhanced . in these studies , photon interactions with the anomalous magnetic moment of nucleons",
    "are , however , not considered .",
    "including this contribution and using empirical form factors extracted from photoproduction of lambda from protons , the cross sections for these reactions have been evaluated in ref.@xcite and were again found to be a few hundred nb except that the one on protons is somewhat larger than the one on neutrons . in both ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite",
    ", it was further found that the @xmath0 production cross section is significantly reduced if its parity is negative .    besides the reactions @xmath11 and @xmath13 , the @xmath0 was also observed in the reaction @xmath1 by the clas collaboration at jlab @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in ref.@xcite that this process is likely to result from the decay of @xmath19 in the reaction @xmath20 . since",
    "this cross section has not been considered in previous studies , we shall evaluate it in this paper using the hadronic lagrangians introduced in refs.@xcite but with improved considerations of the @xmath0 coupling constants and the form factors at strong interaction vertices .",
    "our results show that the magnitude of the cross section is sensitive to the parity of @xmath0 and is thus useful in the experimental determination of @xmath0 parity .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath30 can in principle be determined from the width @xmath31 of @xmath0 .",

    "we use su(3 ) symmetry to relate @xmath30 to @xmath38 between the coupling of pentaquark @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 @xcite , with @xmath38 determined from the decay width of @xmath39 to @xmath42 , given by an expression similar to eq.([width ] ) with @xmath30 , @xmath44 , and @xmath37 replaced by @xmath45 times the @xmath46 coupling @xmath38 , the @xmath39 mass @xmath47 , and the pion mass @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the pentaquark @xmath39 is the @xmath49 in the particle data book @xcite , we then obtain @xmath50 and thus @xmath51 from @xmath52 mev , where @xmath53 mev is the total decay width of @xmath49 and 0.15 is the branching ratio for decaying to @xmath42 @xcite . however , it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that @xmath49 can not be a pure antidecuplet pentaquark baryon as it then can not have the large decay branching ratio to @xmath54 seen empirically . following ref.@xcite",
    ", we assume that antidecuplet pentaquark baryons are mixed ideally with octet pentaquark baryons . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0 remains a pure antidecuplet pentaquark baryon but the mixed pentaquark baryons ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) are octet pentaquark baryons , can be identified with the @xmath49 in the particle data book .",
    "this then leads to the coupling constant @xmath59 and thus @xmath60 . according to eq.([width ] ) , this would give a @xmath0 width of @xmath61 mev , which is smaller than that seen in photonucleon reactions @xcite but is larger than that in kaon - nucleon reactions @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath62 between @xmath0 and @xmath63 can be similarly determined from the su(3 ) relation @xmath64 .",

    ", we include also its interaction with the anomalous magnetic moment of nucleons with empirical values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . since the anomalous magnetic moment of @xmath0 is not known , we neglect its coupling to photon .",

    "the polarization vectors of photon and @xmath86 are given , respectively , by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "to take into account the internal structure of hadrons , form factors are needed at strong interaction vertices . in our previous studies of @xmath0 production in the reactions @xmath97 ,",
    "we have used the same form factor @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the three momentum of photon in the center of mass frame , for all amplitudes in order to keep the total amplitude gauge invariant .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath100 gev used in these studies is obtained from fitting the empirical charmed hadron production cross section in photon - proton reactions at 6 gev with similar interaction lagrangians based on su(4 ) flavor symmetry with empirical hadron masses and coupling constants @xcite .",
    "although this form factor suppresses the growth of total cross section with increasing center of mass energy , it does not damp sufficiently the increasing contribution of @xmath101channel diagram to the differential cross section at large four momentum transfer .",
    "this can be improved by using a form factor for the @xmath101channel amplitude that depends on the momentum of the exchanged particle instead of the momentum of the photon .",
    "since the @xmath101channel amplitude is gauge invariant by itself , the total amplitude remains gauge invariant even the form factor for the @xmath101channel amplitude is different from that for the @xmath102 and @xmath103channel amplitudes.in the present study , we follow , however , the method of ref.@xcite for photoproduction of lambda from protons by introducing different covariant form factors for the @xmath102 , @xmath101 , and @xmath103channel amplitudes , and they are given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath6 , and @xmath106 with corresponding masses @xmath107 , @xmath37 , and @xmath44 of the off - shell particles at strong interaction vertices . the cutoff parameter @xmath108 characterizes the off - shell momentum above which hadron internal structure becomes important , and its value will be determined empirically .",
    "although the @xmath101channel amplitude @xmath109 after including the form factor @xmath110 remains gauge invariant , adding form factors @xmath111 and @xmath110 respectively to the @xmath102 and @xmath101channel amplitudes @xmath112 and @xmath113 leads to terms that violate the gauge invariance .",
    "the gauge violation can , however , be removed by introducing a contact term in the interaction lagrangian that gives an additional amplitude of the form @xmath114p(p_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath115 @xcite , @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) @xcite , or @xmath118 @xcite . here , we adopt the last @xmath119 in order to maintain both crossing symmetry and the pole structure of original amplitude .",
    "to determine the value of cutoff parameter @xmath108 , we again use similar interaction lagrangians based on the su(4 ) flavor symmetry with empirical masses and coupling constants to study charmed hadron production from photon - proton reactions at center - of - mass energy of 6 gev @xcite .",
    "comparisons with available experimental data gives @xmath120 gev , which is similar to the soft form factor considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for describing experimental data on lambda production in photoproton reactions .",
    "the resulting differential cross section for the reaction @xmath20 is then @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the magnitude of the three momenta of initial - state particles in the center - of - mass frame , i.e. , @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath19 can decay into either @xmath124 or @xmath125 with a branching ratio of 2 to 1 , the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath1 is thus 2/3 of that given by eq.([dsdt ] ) .",
    "we first show in fig . [ cross1 ] the total cross section for the production of a positive parity @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath1 obtained without form factors but with different values of 1.8 ( dotted curves ) , 0 ( solid curves ) , and -1.8 ( dashed curves ) for the coupling constant @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen that the cross section with @xmath79 , corresponding to neglect of @xmath102 and @xmath103channels diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] , generally has the smallest value .",
    "this implies that @xmath102 and @xmath103channel contributions due to @xmath126 coupling are most important when we neglect the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "including form factors at strong interaction vertices according to the method described in the previous section , the resulting total cross sections are shown in fig .",

    "[ cross1 ] without form factors .",
    "furthermore , unlike the case without form factors , the dependence of the cross section on the value of @xmath62 is small .",
    "this result thus shows that the effect of form factors on @xmath128 and @xmath106 channels are much stronger than on the @xmath6 channel , which gives the dominant contribution when the hadron internal structure is taken into account .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath62 , the total cross section obtained with form factors has a peak value of 10 - 15 nb at photon energy @xmath12 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ across1 ] , we show the differential cross section for producing a positive parity @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath1 as a function of negative four momentum transfer @xmath129 for photon energies of @xmath1303 , 4 , 5 , and 6 gev and using different values of 1.8 ( dotted curves ) , 0 ( solid curves ) , and -1.8 ( dashed curves ) for the coupling constant @xmath62 . in all cases , the differential cross section peaks at small negative four momentum transfer as expected from the dominant @xmath101channel diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] .",
    "we have assumed in the above that the parity of @xmath0 is positive as predicted by the chiral soliton model @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", results from lattice qcd calculations have indicated that the mass of @xmath0 observed in experiments is consistent with that of a negative parity pentaquark baryon with spin 1/2 and isospin 0 @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the interaction lagrangians involving @xmath0 are given by @xmath131 this changes the expression for the @xmath0 width shown in eq.([width ] ) , i.e. , the @xmath132 is replaced by @xmath36 . as a result ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath30 is reduced by about a factor of 7 , i.e. , @xmath133 if the @xmath0 width is taken to be 9 mev . since @xmath49 is known to have positive parity , it could not be in the same multiplet as @xmath0 if the latter has negative parity .",
    "the su(3 ) relation used previously for relating @xmath62 to @xmath134 is then not applicable .",
    "instead , we assume that the ratio @xmath135 remains the same whether @xmath0 has positive or negative parity .",
    "this leads to @xmath136 for negative parity @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitudes for the three diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] for producing a negative parity @xmath0 are similar to those in eq.([amplitude ] ) for positive parity @xmath0 except that the factor @xmath137 should be inserted after @xmath138 in all three amplitudes .",

    "it is seen that these cross sections are insensitive to the value of @xmath62 as the dominant contribution is from the @xmath101channel diagram involving only @xmath30 .",

    "[ diagram1 ] .",
    "similar considerations for the reactions @xmath144 and @xmath145 have shown that the contribution from the @xmath17 exchange is negligible ( about a few % ) compared to that from the @xmath17 decay @xcite .",
    "it is thus safe to neglect its contribution .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath30 used in present study is determined using su(3 ) symmetry from the coupling constant @xmath146 , which can be extracted from the empirical decay width of @xmath49 to @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting value leads to a @xmath0 decay width of about 9 mev , which is between those seen in photonucleon experiments @xcite and in kaon - nucleon reactions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 width is less than 1 mev as suggested in refs.@xcite based on analyses of @xmath7 scattering data , the cross sections shown in the above , which are dominated by @xmath101channel contribution due to the @xmath16 coupling , would be reduced significantly as it is then proportional to the square of the coupling constant @xmath30 , similar to the width of @xmath0 as shown in eq.([width ] ) .",
    "the calculated cross section is also sensitive to the value of cutoff parameter used in the form factors as shown by figs.[cross1 ] and [ cross2 ] for results without and with form factors .",
    "if we use a harder form factor with cutoff parameter @xmath147 gev , which is twice the value used in present study , the resulting cross sections would increase by more than an order of magnitude . to have a reliable prediction for the cross section for the reaction @xmath1 as well as those for other @xmath0 production reactions",
    "thus requires a good knowledge on both the coupling constants @xmath30 as well as the form factors .",

    "we find that value of the cross section for producing a positive @xmath0 is 10 - 15 nb with dominating contribution from the @xmath101channel kaon - exchange diagram that involves only the @xmath16 coupling .",

    "<S> the cross section is reduced by more than a factor of 10 if @xmath0 has negative parity as given by lattice qcd studies . for both parities , the differential distribution peaks at small negative four momentum transfer as expected from the dominating @xmath6-channel kaon - exchange diagram that involves only the coupling of @xmath0 to @xmath2 . </S>"
