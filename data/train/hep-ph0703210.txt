    "@xmath0 factory experiments have accumulated a lot of data on exclusive hadronic @xmath0 decays , and have reported many interesting results  @xcite .",
    "some observables , mixing - induced cp asymmetries for @xmath6 penguin modes , branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and other observables , have exhibited some deviations from nave expectations in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is necessary to go beyond nave estimations for understanding the observed deviations , by including subdominant contributions , such as spectator and annihilation diagrams , and higher - order corrections .",
    "most of the calculations of @xmath0 decay amplitudes rely on the factorization of decay amplitudes into a product of short - distance and long - distance physics .",
    "qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite are based on collinear factorization theorem , but the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach  @xcite is based on @xmath7 factorization theorem . employing collinear factorization theorem ,",
    "some decay amplitudes involve a singularity arising from the end - point region of parton momentum fractions .",
    "an end - point singularity implies that the decay amplitude is dominated by soft dynamics and can not be further factorized .",
    "such soft contributions are regarded as phenomenological parameters , which are fitted from experimental data .    in the pqcd approach with @xmath7 factorization theorem , there is no end - point singularity because of the sudakov factor  @xcite .",
    "all amplitudes then can be factorized into parton distribution amplitudes @xmath8 , the sudakov factors @xmath9 , the jet function @xmath10 , and the hard kernel @xmath11 as  @xcite @xmath12 where the symbols @xmath13 stand for convolutions in both longitudinal and transverse momenta of partons .",
    "the distribution amplitudes , which are universal in the processes under consideration , are determined from experiments , the light - cone qcd sum rules , lattice calculations , or other non - perturbative methods , and are the main source of uncertainty .",
    "the hard kernel is characterized by the hard scale @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a hadronic scale and @xmath16 the @xmath17 quark mass , and can be evaluated as an expansion in powers of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the schematic picture of the factorization theorem is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ktfact ] .     pqcd factorization theorem for @xmath20 . ]",
    "the parton transverse momenta @xmath21 in the mesons are of the order of @xmath15 . with infinitely many collinear gluon emissions ,",
    "@xmath7 accumulate and reach @xmath22 in the hard kernel .",
    "it ensures the absence of the end - point singularities  @xcite .",
    "the hard kernels of the spectator and the annihilation contributions , as well as the emission contribution , are calculable and start from @xmath23 .",
    "pqcd has applied to various two - body @xmath0 decays at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath24 , and has made reasonable predictions for many modes .",
    "note that pqcd predicts a large direct cp asymmetry in the @xmath25 mode as a result of a large strong phase arising from scalar - penguin annihilation diagrams  @xcite .",
    "recently , a part of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions have been included in the pqcd approach  @xcite .        only the most important nlo contributions coming from the nlo wilson coefficients , the vertex corrections , the quark loops , and the magnetic penguin , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] , have been considered  @xcite , because other nlo corrections , mainly to the @xmath0 meson transition form factors , can be eliminated by choosing an appropriate scale @xmath26  @xcite . in this talk , we summarize nlo pqcd predictions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the penguin - dominated @xmath3 modes , @xmath27 being a pseudo - scalar ( vector ) meson .    this talk is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : pik ] , we discuss the branching ratios and the cp asymmetries of @xmath28 and @xmath2 with the nlo corrections . the predictions of the penguin - dominated @xmath3 decays are presented in sec .",

    "section  [ sec : summary ] is a summary .",
    "the current data of the direct cp asymmetries of @xmath28 and the branching ratios of @xmath29 listed in table  [ tab : pik_pipi ] are inconsistent with the nave expectations @xmath30    .[tab : pik_pipi ] branching ratios in units of @xmath31 and direct cp asymmetries in percentage for the @xmath28 and @xmath2 decays  @xcite .

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     pqcd predicts positive deviations , opposite to the observed ones , except for the @xmath32 case . in",
    "the @xmath33 decays , both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are almost imaginary and parallel to each other .",
    "therefore , pqcd predicts the negative @xmath36 . among the modes studied here , @xmath37 is the cleanest one , since it dose not involve @xmath35 .",
    "the predictions are basically in agreement with those in qcdf , but differ from those in qcdf@xmath38ld , which predicted @xmath39 .",
    "in this talk , we have summarized the recent works on exclusive @xmath0 meson decays in the pqcd approach , with focus on @xmath28 , @xmath2 , and the penguin - dominated @xmath3 modes .    in the nlo pqcd analysis",
    ", it has been found that the color - suppressed tree amplitude is enhanced by the vertex corrections ; the direct cp asymmetries for the @xmath28 modes have approached the observed values .",
    "the @xmath40 branching ratio is , however , still too small , compared with the measured value .",
    "nlo pqcd has also predicted the different patterns of the direct cp asymmetries among the @xmath28 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 modes as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pik ] ) , ( [ eq : pikstar ] ) , and ( [ eq : rhok ] ) . those patterns ,",
    "if confirmed by data , will support the source of strong phases from the scalar - penguin annihilation diagrams in the pqcd approach .",
    "the predicted mixing - induced cp asymmetries for the penguin - dominated modes basically show the positive deviations , @xmath43 , except for @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the central values of the current data , @xmath45 , seem to be still puzzling .",
