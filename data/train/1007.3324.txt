    "the galactic center ( gc ) has been the target of several major observing campaigns with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "one of the primary results of these campaigns has been to unveil numerous faint and spectrally hard x - ray point sources toward the gc region .",
    "hard x - ray sources , with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that peak above 1.5 kev , often arise from high extinction .",
    "@xcite uncovered @xmath10 1000 such point sources in a @xmath11 field while searching for the source of the he - like fe emission emanating from the gc . to investigate the nature of these point sources , @xcite reobserved the central @xmath12 around sgr a * for an additional 590ks , increasing the total observing time to 626 ks and the number of x - ray point sources to 2357 .",
    "more than 2000 of the sources were undetected below 1.5 kev , indicating a large amount of extinction .",
    "the line - of - sight to the galactic center has an average column density of @xmath13 @xcite , which causes the flux below 1.5 kev to experience more than @xmath14 of attenuation @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the hard x - ray sources with attenuated emission below 1.5 kev lie at or beyond the gc distance .",
    "the faintness and hardness of the x - ray emission from these sources could in theory be met by background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , but @xcite find that the number of background agn within the @xmath11 field is @xmath15 , using the source count distributions from the _ chandra _ deep field extragalactic surveys .",
    "@xcite perform a similar analysis of the number of background agns in the smaller @xmath12 field and find that between 20 - 100 of the 2076 x - ray sources detected at energies above 2kev are agn , meaning that the bulk of the hard x - ray sources lie within the galaxy near to or beyond the gc distance .",
    "@xcite enumerate the possible classes to which these unidentified x - ray sources may belong ; these include coronally active main sequence stars , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , algol binaries , wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , pulsars , low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "the soft foreground x - ray sources could in theory belong to any of these classes based on their x - ray seds ; however their low x - ray luminosity suggests that they may be more likely to be cvs or coronally active single stars . of these candidate source types , only lmxbs , hmxbs and a subclass of cvs with high magnetic fields called intermediate polars ( ips )",
    "are known to produce enough hard x - rays to be detectable through the large extinction to the gc .",
    "@xcite search for x - ray flux variability of the sources in the @xcite x - ray point source catalog .",
    "they detect 8 sources with periodic variability among the brightest x - ray sources , but the vast majority of sources are too faint to search for flux variability at similar levels .    the next step in identifying the nature of the x - ray sources is to search for them at other wavelengths .",
    "the near - infrared bandpass is well suited to this effort because stellar photospheres are bright in these bands and the average extinction is dramatically less than at optical pass - bands .",
    "however , source crowding makes definitive association between x - ray and ir sources difficult . for example",
    ", a @xmath16 radius circle at a random location within @xmath17 of sgr a@xmath3 would contain a _",
    "_ @xmath7__@xmath18 star more than 25 @xmath6 of the time and this percentage only increases with fainter magnitudes .",
    "thus , the authenticity of an individual ir / x - ray match can only be verified through spectroscopy .",
    "however , one can also examine the astrometrically identified candidate counterparts as a group , and make statistical arguments as to the presence and possible nature of true counterparts within the catalog of matched sources .",
    "several groups approach this problem by calculating the excess in the number of x - ray / ir matches over the number expected by random coincidence , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used isaac on the vlt to image fields containing 77 of the x - ray point sources discovered by @xcite .",
    "they detect a small excess in counterparts in the _ j _ and _ h _ bands , but find no significant excess in matches in the _ k _ band .",
    "however , the positions of a number of the x - ray sources in the first _",
    "chandra _ source catalog were found be inaccurate at the 0.5@xmath19 level .",
    "a reanalysis of the x - ray / ir matching of these data sets after the x - ray astrometry was improved indicates a 2 - 3 @xmath20 excess in detections over that expected from random chance in _",
    "j_,_h _ and _ k _ bands @xcite .",
    "@xcite observe the central @xmath21 gc area with the panic near - infrared camera on magellan to a confusion limit of _",
    "_ @xmath7__@xmath22 .",
    "cross - correlating their ir catalog to the x - ray catalog of @xcite , they find a strong ir / x - ray matching significance for the soft x - ray sources , but little significance for the hard x - ray sources .",
    "they calculate that no more than 10 @xmath6 of the hard x - ray point sources can have apparent _",
    "@xmath7 _ magnitudes brighter than 15 mag . assuming these hard x - ray sources reside in the gc",
    ", they conclude that certain types of x - ray binaries that have bright mass - donor stars , such as be - neutron hmxbs , must contribute no more than 10 @xmath6 to the hard x - ray source numbers .",
    "@xcite perform similar matching simulations using a catalog of @xmath10 20000 _ spitzer _ irac point sources detected at @xmath23 and @xmath24 lying within the @xmath25 field of the @xcite _ chandra _ observations .",
    "they found that the soft x - ray sources are correlated to the irac catalog , but they detect no such correlation to the hard x - ray sources .",
    "however , they note that source crowding limits their catalog to galactic center sources with @xmath26 < 12.4~mag$ ] , and actual counterparts may be much fainter than this limit .",
    "since these studies were published , the galactic center x - ray point source catalog has been updated to include a total of 2 ms of accumulated observations of the @xmath0 area around sgr a@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "9017 x - ray point sources are detected , the positions of many of which have been refined from the earlier catalogs .",
    "the majority of the sources in the catalog have astrometric errors less than 0.7  .",
    "@xcite utilize this data together with near - infrared data from the sirius camera on the 1.4 m telescope at sutherland observatory in south africa , and present a catalog of 5184 potential near - infrared candidate counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "they find that , statistically , 394 of the nir matches to the hard x - ray sources are real counterparts .",
    "this amounts to @xmath27 of the 6760 hard x - ray sources , consistent with the findings of @xcite which limit this percentage to no more than @xmath28 .    a complete accounting of the fraction of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) can provide a useful tracer of both the accumulated star formation and the ongoing star formation in the gc @xcite .",
    "the search can also yield rare and important systems , such as microquasars , x - ray pulsars , and wind - colliding binaries .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have discovered possible wind - colliding o supergiant and wolf - rayet binaries in the gc .",
    "these systems could prove to be important laboratories for studies of high - mass stellar winds and it may be that more sources of this rare type will be found amoung the gc x - ray population .",
    "the only way to positively identify individual sources is with spectroscopy . in the near infrared , active accretion manifests in emission lines , such as in br@xmath29 line emission .",
    "spectroscopic campaigns such as those described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have observed only the brightest infrared matches to x - ray sources . with the coming advent of deep multi - object spectroscopy in the near - infrared @xcite",
    ", it will be possible to comprehensively follow up nearly all potential near - infrared counterparts , greatly increasing the chance of discovering the true nature of these x - ray populations .",
    "in this work , we present new nir imaging of the deepest part of the _ chandra _ observations in the @xmath12 area around @xmath30 containing 4339 x - ray point sources .",
    "we create a catalog of 2137 candidate nir counterparts to x - ray point sources and statistically identify the locations of the true counterparts on a nir color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we also isolate the characteristics that make likely authentic counterparts easier to find amongst the large number of spurious matches .",
    "these results will greatly aid the target selection for future spectroscopic observations as well as indicating the likely types of interacting binaries we may identify within this source population .",
    "we use four sets of data in this work : the _ chandra _ x - ray point source catalog of @xcite , a near - infrared _ j_,_h _ and _ @xmath7 _ catalog from our observations with ispi at the ctio 4 m telescope , the 2mass _ @xmath1 _ all sky data release @xcite , and the _ jhk _ imaging data and catalogs of the ukidss galactic plane survey @xcite . the 2mass and ukidss data were used to photometrically and astrometrically calibrate the ispi data , while the ispi data and _ chandra _ data were used to create a crossmatched source catalog .      @xcite compile 88 _ chandra _ observations of the galactic center ( gc ) taken between april 2000 and august 2007 and find 9017 point sources over a @xmath31 field .",
    "the @xmath32 field centered on sgr a@xmath3 has been the target of 1ms of exposures and has some of the best sensitivity ( @xmath33 ergs s@xmath34 for gc sources at 8 kpc distance ) and the best positional accuracy in the x - ray catalog .",

    "the individual exposure times were short , 3.2s for _ h _ and _ @xmath7 _ and 5s for _ j _ , so that the number of saturated bright sources would be kept to a minimum .",
    "we used a 5 point dither pattern with a nod length of @xmath39 to compensate for the detector s cosmetic defects .",

    "the number of unreddened counterparts are consistent with the contribution expected from coronally active stars in the field @xcite .",
    "the fact that the x - ray spectra appear soft suggests that these sources lie within 4 kpc of the sun @xcite .",
    "since the stars can be arbitrarily closer than this distance , and dwarf stars have a wide dispersion in magnitudes , it is difficult to place further constraints on the population of unreddened ir counterparts to soft x - ray sources without spectroscopy .    the real counterparts to soft sources with @xmath260 are more mysterious since the high reddening implied by the ir color should also make the x - ray component appear hard .",
    "however , @xcite do note that for sources near the hard / soft threshhold , the uncertainty could cause a hard source to be labeled as a soft source , and vice versa .",
    "another possibility is that these systems may have internal absorption that affects the ir component more than the x - ray component . finally , for some sources that are particularly strong soft x - ray emitters , the large extinction may not soften it enough to change its hard / soft designation .",
    "one such source in our sample ( cxo174550.6 - 285919 ) , is nominally soft and reddened but spectroscopic follow - up found that it was a wolf - rayet binary in the galactic center , with a spectral class wn6b @xcite .    in  4.5",

    "the hard x - ray source cmd has three bins with a 2@xmath20 detection of 9 or more real matches ( the blue boxes in figure [ fig : hardcmd ] ) .",

    "[ fig : hardcmd ] we show the cmd positions of the 98 hard , reddened matches with a @xmath66-band detection , of which @xmath271 should be real as discussed in  4.6 .",
    "these sources represent the highest proportion of reddened authentic counterparts to hard x - ray sources that we could locate in the matched catalog .",
    "even so , half of these counterparts are spurious .",
    "since the criterion of a @xmath66 detection was used to enhance the real counterpart probability , the lower right cmd is excluded due to flux sensitivity .",
    "the unknown distance , unknown extinction and unknown intrinsic @xmath272 color make interpretation of the hard counterpart cmd complicated .",
    "nevertheless , a useful constraint on the @xmath273 magnitudes can be found by considering ranges of the uncertainty in these parameters .",
    "@xcite argue that the majority of hard x - ray sources must be farther than 4kpc from the sun , because of the extinction column required to make soft sources appear as hard .",
    "we adopt this value as the minimum distance for hard x - ray sources .",
    "for the maximum distance , we use a value of 8kpc , a reasonable value for the distance to the galactic center .",
    "there is the possibility of observing bright ir counterparts on the far side of the bulge ( with distance @xmath274 ) .",
