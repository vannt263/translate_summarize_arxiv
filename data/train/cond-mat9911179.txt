    "in the kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , significant efforts have been devoted to improve the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite one approach , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite , has been successively improved for the last two decades and now is approaching chemical accuracy ( atomization energy errors of order 1 kcal / mol = 0.0434 ev ) with further refinements in the so - called meta - gga ( mgga).@xcite the ( m)gga is desirable in that it leads to better physical quantities for various systems of interest , while it is still computationally cheap due to its semi - local nature .",
    "it is clear , however , that any local or semi - local approximation can not fully reproduce the behavior of the exact nonlocal exchange - correlation energy functional , so one needs to be aware of the limitations of these approximation schemes and the situations where they can break down .    in this article",
    ", we discuss one situation where the local and semi - local approximations of the exchange - correlation energy functional inherently break down : systems with two - dimensional ( 2d ) characteristics , which is relevant to dft computations of semiconductor devices or other physical systems with 2d character .",
    "the original motivation of the current work is recent developments in semiconductor nanotechnology that have achieved quantum dots , which offer enormous technological prospects and allow the study of novel physical phenomena due to dimensionality and electronic correlation effects.@xcite quantum dots can be achieved by confining a 2d electron gas with patterned gates .",
    "semiconductor quantum devices in general involve large ranges of electron densities and density gradients , and the effect of electron - electron interactions can be important , so they provide ideal test cases of the approximate functionals commonly used in dft . however , although dft has been already extensively applied to the study of these systems , @xcite the validity of conventional approximation schemes in these systems has not been fully addressed .",
    "hence , we investigate the robustness of various density - based three - dimensional ( 3d ) local and semi - local exchange and correlation energy functional approximations , lda , gga , and mgga , in the 2d - limit using the idealized quasi-2d electron gas and quantum dot systems .",
    "we show that there are inherent limitations resulting from the local or semi - local nature of the exchange - correlation hole in these approximations .",
    "especially , we point out that within the restricted form of the gga it is very difficult to incorporate the necessary requirement for the 2d limit while at the same time maintaining desirable features of present functionals .",
    "we contrast the limitation of these local and semi - local approximations with the nonlocal average density approximation ( ada ) , and explicitly show the improvement by employing the ada for the quasi-2d electron gas system .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] , we review the features of the lda , gga , mgga , and ada necessary for our later discussions . in particular , we emphasize that the approximations in these functionals are essentially approximations to the exchange - correlation hole . in sec .",
    "[ sec : limit ] , we first establish the limitation of the local and semi - local approximations by considering the nature of the approximations to the exchange - correlation holes in the 2d limit , and contrast them with the nonlocal approximation ( sec . [ subsec:2d_limit ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ subsec:2degas ] we explicitly show this in the 2d homogeneous electron gas with finite thickness : compared with the exact exchange energy which is finite in the 2d limit , the 3d lda , gga , and mgga exchange energies incorrectly diverge to negative infinity .",
    "especially , we point out that the direction of the gga and mgga correction to the lda should be opposite to that of the current forms .",
    "this is contrasted with the nonlocal ada approximation which has a finite 2d - limit . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : qdot ] , we investigate an idealized quantum dot system . by varying the confinement strength along one direction ,",
    "the system changes its character from 3d to 2d .",
    "we show that , while the lda , gga , and mgga give satisfactory descriptions of the isotropic limit , they again fail in the 2d - limit .",
    "present ( m)gga s are better than the lda in the isotropic 3d - limit , but they are again worse than the lda in the 2d - limit . in addition , we comment on the validity of 2d and 3d dft calculations of quantum dots at the experimentally realistic range of anisotropy . in sec . [ subsec : other ] , we discuss density functional calculations of two physical systems with 2d characters , jellium surface and the graphite .",
    "we conclude this paper by summarizing the current work in sec .",

    "thus we might expect the lda hole to be a reasonable approximation when the exact exchange - correlation hole is close to the electron .",
    "since only the spherical average of the exchange - correlation hole @xmath15 influences the exchange - correlation energy , @xcite the spherically symmetric nature of the lda hole does not necessarily represent a poor approximation .",

    "although the idea of utilizing density gradient information as a way to improve the lda was proposed in the original papers of kohn and sham@xcite , it is only in the last decade or so in which successful gga functionals have appeared .",
    "this suggests that some of the correct physics of the exchange - correlation effects , which were missing in the original naive gradient expansion approximation ( gea ) , have been incorporated in recent developments of the gga . the most important step in the development of the gga was the recognition by perdew and coworkers that the exchange - correlation hole in the gea does not correspond to a physical hole , nor does it satisfy the negativity condition of the exchange hole [ eq.([eq : rhox- ] ) ] and normalization conditions of the exchange and correlation holes [ eq.([eq : rhoxc_sum])].@xcite following their argument , the gga can be understood as an approximation of the exchange - correlation hole in which the spurious long - range part of the second - order gea exchange - correlation gea hole has been cut - off in the real space to satisfy the conditions of eq .",

    "( [ eq : rhoxc_sum ] ) .",

    "correlation is more difficult to include , but its contribution to the total energy is typically much smaller than the exchange , especially for systems with large density gradients .",
    "hence , the main qualitative results of this work , which is concerned with the strong anisotropic 2d - limit , are determined at the exchange level . for correlations , we employed pw91- and pbe - gga which are almost identical and designed to be turned off for large density gradient region as shown in fig .",

    "however , the relevant feature of the @xmath44 for the current discussion is that it ( or its exchange - correlation hole ) is still semi - local and @xmath44 is always larger than or equal to 1 since it is based on the pbe - gga ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : qdot]-(b ) , except that , for small @xmath113 , the differences between the 3d lda and ( m)gga exchange - correlation energies are smaller than the exchange case alone , which shows that the 3d lda is a good approximation with the exchange and correlation together rather than separately .    before closing this section",
    ", we comment on realistic experimental situations for quantum dots . using a value of @xmath114 mev , estimated by the vertical extent of quantum dots ( approximately @xmath115 ) ,",
    "one finds the realistic range of @xmath113 is about @xmath116 , which is not the extreme 2d - limit where we observed the breakdown of 3d local / semilocal dft approximations .",
    "hence 3d lda or ( m)gga quantum dot simulation results should be reliable for such experimentally realistic problems",
    ". further fig .",
    "[ fig : qdot]-(b ) suggests that 3d and 2d functionals are about equally applicable in this range although 3d functionals are definitely better for @xmath117 .    in addition , by comparing our 3d and 2d exx models , we can study the effect of employing strict-2d quantum dot simulations as have been adopted in many theoretical studies.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dvs3d ] , we compare the lateral components of 3d total kinetic energy @xmath118 , total external potential energy @xmath119 , and hartree @xmath120 exchange energy @xmath121 , with the corresponding 2d values . physically , the electron - electron interaction makes the electrons more extended than the noninteracting counterparts , which decreases the kinetic energy and increases the potential energy . on the other hand",
    ", the finite thickness of the 2d electron layer has the effect of softening the coulomb interaction as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec:2degas ] , which results in the increase of the kinetic energy and decrease of the potential energy than the 2d limiting values as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dvs3d ] .",
    "this effect is pronounced up to @xmath122 , and we expect this feature will be missing in the strict-2d calculations .",
    "one more noticeable point is that the anisotropy of the potential induces bigger change in the hartree @xmath120 exchange energy ( + 1.20 mev ) than those in the kinetic energy ( -0.38 mev ) and potential energy ( + 0.80 mev ) from the values of the isotropic limit .      in this subsection , we consider two physical systems with 2d character to which our study might have relevance .",
    "first example is jellium surfaces , which have recently drawn renewed interest due to the discrepancies between results from different schemes.@xcite although we believe quatum monte carlo calculation results@xcite are the most accurate , it is not our intention here to address this question .",
    "rather , the relevant point we would like to emphasize is that the conclusions of the present study are consistent with those of rasolt and geldart @xcite on the gradient corrections in the jellium surface : to support their first gradient correction coefficient having a different sign from that found in the atomic systems , they emphasized the difference between the localized and extended system and argued that their form is the proper one to use especially for jelliumm surfaces.@xcite actually , they further brought caution on forcing a `` universal '' gradient approximation form where none exists , which is a warning we feel has been largely ignored .",
    "we believe our study supports the argument of rasolt and geldart , and especially our second model system , quantum dot , is a dramatic example showing the nonexistence of a universal gga form .",
    "the second system we examine is graphite .",
    "graphite and intercalated graphite constitute another large family of materials with quasi-2d electronic properties .",
    "interestingly , in our previous invetigations , we observed that the lda gives a better description of the energy difference between the diamond and hexagonal graphite structures of c than the pw91- or pbe - gga both at the theoretical and experimental lattice constants.@xcite since the lda and gga descriptions of the diamond c are both satisfactory , we can conclude that the gga descriptions of the graphite is the origin of the problem . to trace the specific source of the error , we decomposed the self - consistent total energies at the experimental lattice constants from lda , pw91-gga , and pbe - gga calculations into kinetic , potential , and exchange - correlation energies .",
    "the kinetic + potential energy differences between the diamond and graphite structures from the lda / pbe - gga calculations were -820/-865 mev , while the exchange - correlation energy differences between the two structures were 231/386 mev .",
    "the fact that the magnitude of the kinetic + potential energy is more than two times bigger than the exchange - correlation energy , while the energy difference in the exchange - correlation part is three times bigger than the kinetic + potential part indicates that the description of the graphite in the pbe - gga functional is the main source of the deficiencies .",
    "this is closely related with our findings in the present work , that the gga gives poorer descriptions of 2d systems than the lda . in hexagonal graphite , there are eight electrons per unit cell , and two of them in the @xmath123-like state can be considered as 2d electrons , which corresponds to @xmath92 = 3.54 @xmath64 or @xmath124 = 0.41 @xmath125 . the valence - electron charge density distribution is known experimentally,@xcite so one can estimate the thickness of the electron layer @xmath126 as @xmath127 2.33 @xmath64 or @xmath128 .",
    "this correspond to @xmath129 in fig .",
    "3 , suggesting that the gga s poorer description of the energy difference between the hexagonal graphite and diamond can be explained by our findings in this work .",
    "the purpose of this work was to show the fundamental limitation of the 3d local / semi - local exchange - correlation energy functional approximations of dft by considering systems with 2d characteristics .",
    "we traced the source of the failure of the lda , gga , and mgga in 2d systems to the ( semi-)local nature of their approximate exchange - correlation holes .",
    "these local / semi - local approximations have been contrasted with a nonlocal approximation such as the ada , and the difference has been explicitly demonstrated in our first model , quasi-2d electron gas , in which the ada reproduced the correct limiting behavior .",
    "the 2d - limit can be considered as a constraint on approximate functionals .",
    "this condition is not built in most of the ( m)gga s , and we emphasized that its form is inherently too restricted to incorporate this requirement while keeping the necessary property to improve the lda for other conventional systems .",
    "our second example , an anisotropic quantum dot in which we need different signs of the ( m)gga corrections to the lda at 3d- and 2d - limits , explicitly shows the danger of expecting a universal gradient approximation form as pointed out by rasolt and geldart .",
    "@xcite two other realistic systems , jellium surface and graphite have been discussed as relevant examples . for practical device simulations , however , we pointed out that the lda and ( m)gga results should be qualitatively correct , as long as experimentally realistic situations are considered .    _ note _ after completion of the present work , we were informed that pollack and perdew have also studied the quasi-2d electron gas results using a different quantum well model , finding results in agreement with ours presented in sec.[subsec:2degas ] .",
