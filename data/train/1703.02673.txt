    "in the initial condition of the string melting version of the ampt model , we fragment the excited strings into hadrons and then decompose each hadron into its constituent quarks before the parton cascade . as a result , almost all the produced energy enters the parton cascade for possible scatterings .",
    "this is why the string melting ampt model has a clear advantage over the default ampt model in describing the anisotropic flows in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "after the parton scatterings , a quark coalescence model is used to describe the hadronization process .",
    "it combines a quark with a nearby antiquark to form a meson and combines three nearby quarks ( or antiquarks ) into a baryon ( or an antibaryon ) .    for the finite number of quarks and antiquarks in an event , the current quark coalescence model in ampt @xcite searches for a meson partner before searching for baryon or antibaryon partners .",
    "specifically , each quark ( or antiquark ) has its default coalescence partner(s ) , which are just the one or two constituent parton(s ) from the decomposition of the quark s parent hadron .",
    "this assignment is possible since currently we only have two - body elastic parton collisions .",
    "then for any available ( i.e. not - yet - coalesced ) quark ( or antiquark ) that originally came from the decomposition of a meson , the quark coalescence model searches all available antiquarks ( or quarks ) and selects the closest one in distance ( in the rest frame of the quark - antiquark system ) as the new coalescence partner to form a meson . after these meson coalescences are all finished , for each remaining quark ( or antiquark ) the model searches all available quarks ( or antiquarks ) and selects the closest two in distance as the new coalescence partners to form a baryon ( or an antibaryon ) . as a result , the total number of baryons in any event after quark coalescence is the same as the total number before , so the number of baryons is conserved by quark coalescence .",
    "similarly , the quark coalescence process also conserves the number of antibaryons and the number of mesons in an event .",
    "we now improve the coalescence method by removing the constraint that forced the separate conservation of the numbers of baryons , antibaryons , and mesons through the quark coalescence for each event .",
    "note that the conservation of the number of net - baryons is still automatically satisfied for each event , as well as the conservation of the number of net - strangeness . specifically , for any available quark , the new coalescence model searches all available antiquarks and records the closest one in relative distance ( denoted as @xmath10 ) as the potential coalescence partner to form a meson .",
    "the model also searches all available quarks and records the closest one in distance as a potential coalescence partner to form a baryon , and then searches all other available quarks again and records the one that gives the smallest average distance ( i.e. the average of the three relative distances among these three quarks in the rest frame of the three - quark system , denoted as @xmath11 ) as the other potential coalescence partner to form a baryon .",
    "when both the meson partner and baryon partners are available , the quark will form a meson or a baryon according to the following criteria : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the new coalescence parameter , which controls the relative probability of a quark forming a baryon instead of forming a meson . in the limit of @xmath14 , there would be no antibaryon formation at all while the minimum number of baryons would be formed due to the conservation of the ( positive ) net - baryon number .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit of @xmath15 , there would be almost no meson formation ( only 0 , 1 , or 2 mesons would be formed depending on the remainder when dividing the total quark number in the event by three ) .",
    "the same coalescence procedure is also applied to all antiquarks . as a result",
    ", the new quark coalescence allows a ( anti)quark the freedom to form a meson or a ( anti)baryon depending on the distance from the coalescence partner(s ) .",
    "this is a more physical picture ; for example , if a subvolume of the dense matter is only made of quarks ( with a total number being a multiple of three ) , it would hadronize to only baryons ( with no mesons ) as we would expect .",
    "we take central ( @xmath16 fm ) au+au collisions at @xmath17 gev as the example and use the same parton cross section ( 1.5 mb ) for all the results shown in this section .",
    "note that the parton phase - space configuration just before quark coalescence is statistically the same for the old and new quark coalescence models ( when using the same parton cross section ) . figure  [ fig1-r ] shows the average relative distance of the quark and antiquark in a primordial meson as well as the average relative distance among the three ( anti)quarks in a primordial ( anti)baryon as functions of the hadron rapidity @xmath18 . here",
    "a primordial hadron means a hadron formed directly from quark coalescence ( before any hadronic reactions ) , not a hadron from resonance decays .",
    "we see that the relative distance for ( anti)baryons from the new quark coalescence ( dashed curve ) is much lower than that from the old quark coalescence ( dotted curve ) ; while the relative distance for mesons is similar to the old model .",

    "figure  [ fig2-t ] shows the average coalescence time of partons in mesons and ( anti)baryons as functions of the hadron rapidity @xmath18 .",
    "we see that ( anti)baryons in the new quark coalescence ( dashed curve ) are now formed much earlier than before .",
    "this is because the old quark coalescence tends to form ( anti)baryons late , since it searches for meson partners before ( anti)baryon partners and a parton will be unavailable for ( anti)baryon formation when it is already used for meson formation . on the other hand , the new quark coalescence searches for the potential meson partner and (",
    "anti)baryon partners concurrently and then determines the hadron type to be formed , making the coalescence process more physical as well as more efficient . in addition",
    ", we see that mesons in the new quark coalescence ( solid curve ) are also formed earlier than before .",

    "[ fig3-de ] have finite widths as a result of the violation of energy conservation .",

    "for the improved string melting ampt model with the new quark coalescence , we take the lund string fragmentation parameters as @xmath23 for au+au collisions at 200 gev and @xmath24 for pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev respectively , while @xmath25 gev@xmath26 .",

    "we have seen that this has led to significant improvements on the proton and antiproton @xmath1-spectra as well as the antibaryon - to - baryon ratios for strange baryons .",
    "furthermore , since the improved model no longer forces the conservation of the baryon number ( or the antibaryon number ) of each event through the quark coalescence process , it allows the fluctuation of the baryon number ( and correspondingly the fluctuation of the antibaryon number ) of each event through quark coalescence ; therefore it is also suitable for future studies of the effects of phase transition on baryon number fluctuations .    with an improved quark coalescence ,",

    "therefore , we conclude that the string melting ampt model with the new quark coalescence provides a better overall description of the bulk matter in high - energy heavy ion collisions .    despite the more physical nature of the new quark coalescence ,",

    "in particular , we have removed the previous constraint that forced the quark coalescence process to conserve the numbers of mesons , baryons , and antibaryons in an event separately , where only the conservation of the net - baryon number needs to be required .",
    "the new quark coalescence now allows a quark to form either a meson or a baryon , depending on the distance to its coalescence partner(s ) .",
    "we then compare results from the improved ampt model with the experimental data in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies from @xmath3 gev to @xmath4 tev , including the centrality and energy dependences of antibaryon - to - baryon ratios .",
    "we show that , besides being able to describe the @xmath0 yields , @xmath1 spectra , and elliptic flows of pions and kaons at low @xmath1 , the improved model also better describes the baryon observables in general , especially the @xmath1 spectra of baryons and antibaryon - to - baryon ratios for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the string melting ampt model with the new quark coalescence thus provides a better overall description of the bulk matter in high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
