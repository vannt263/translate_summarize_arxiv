    "layered transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) have been studied for a long time , in part due to competing orders such as charge density wave ( cdw ) state and superconductivity ( sc).@xcite@xmath7@xcite the interplay between cdw and sc is the fundamental question in these systems .",
    "the cdw state can be tuned into sc via intercalation , substitution or pressure.@xcite usually , there is a dome - like phase diagram , i.e. , the cdw transition temperature decreases when the superconducting critical temperature @xmath8 increases .",
    "it indicates that cdw and sc compete.@xcite on the other hand , there are other tmdcs in which cdw and sc coexist.@xcite therefore , the relationship of these two kinds of quantum orders is not simple and is material and crystal structure dependent .",
    "charge order and superconductivity are also important ingredient in the physics of high @xmath8 cuprate oxides , yet both are much more complicated and are found in proximity to strong magnetic interactions.@xcite since layered tmdcs offer less complex crystal structure in the absence of magnetic order , they can be used to study cdw and sc at a simpler stage .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in pt , pd , cu substituted / intercalated cdi@xmath2-type irte@xmath2 with @xmath8 up to about 3 k has triggered a renewed interest in this field.@xcite irte@xmath2 shows a structural transition from a trigonal to a monoclinic phase when cooled across @xmath9 250 k.@xcite the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) , photoemission and tight - binding electronic structure calculation results show that there is the superlattice modulation with a propagation vector of @xmath10 ( 1/5 , 0 , -1/5 ) , ascribed to an orbitally driven peierls instability.@xcite however , the results from nmr , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and optical conductivity spectra measurements suggest that this structural transition may not be due to the cdw transition but due to the reduction of the kinetic energy of te @xmath11 bands.@xcite on the other hand , with pt , pd , cu substitution or intercalation , the high temperature structural transition is suppressed quickly and superconductivity appears at low temperature , indicating the competing relation between these two phenomena .",
    "isovalent substitution is an effective way to clarify the origin of the structural transition and superconductivity .",
    "it is similar to pressure because it should not induce the extra carrier density but should change the structural parameters , ionic size and electronegativity of elements , thus affecting physical properties .",
    "previous studies have shown that the structural transition at high temperatures is enhanced while the superconducting transition is suppressed by either hydrostatic ( ir@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 ) or chemical ( irte@xmath12se@xmath1 ) pressure.@xcite the latter results are ascribed to the stabilization of polymeric te - te bonds with replacing of te with the more electronegative se .",
    "this is different from other tmdcs exhibiting cdw / sc states where pressure usually suppresses the cdw state and enhances the superconducting state.@xcite    in this work , we report the physical properties of cdi@xmath2-type ir@xmath0rh@xmath1te@xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) polycrystalls .",
    "our results indicate that the high - temperature structural transition is suppressed by rh substitution gradually and the superconductivity appears at low temperature with maximum @xmath8 @xmath9 2.6 k , similar to the results of electronic doping or intercalating samples .",
    "it implies that the structural parameters such as ionic size and electronegativity of elements might be important for the evolution of physical properties in ir@xmath0rh@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ir@xmath0rh@xmath1te@xmath2 were synthesized using a solid - state reaction method as described previously.@xcite stoichiometric amounts of ir , rh , and te elements were mixed , ground , and pelletized .",
    "then , the pellets were placed in alumina crucible which is sealed into quartz tubes with refilled 0.2 atm argon gas .",
    "the pellets were sintered at 1000 @xmath14 for 15 h , followed by furnace cooling to room temperature .",
    "the process was repeated once with an intermediate grinding .",
    "the structure of the samples was characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using capillary transmission geometry in 1 mm diameter cylindrical kapton capillaries at the x7b beamline of the national synchrotron light source ( nsls ) at the brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "samples were measured using a 0.5 mm@xmath15 monochromatic x - ray beam of @xmath9 38 kev ( 0.3916 @xmath16 ) at 300 k. a perkin elmer 2d detector was mounted orthogonal to the beam path 376.4 mm away from the sample .",

    "it indicates that this phase transition is first - order , consistent with the reported value in the literature.@xcite with rh doping , the peak shifts to @xmath52 156 k and the intensity of peak also becomes weaker and less sharp than that in pure irte@xmath2 .",
    "it confirms that rh doping suppresses structural transition to lower temperature and hints at possible change from first- to the second - order nature .    at low temperature ( above @xmath8 )",

    "because the @xmath51 is proportional to the electronic density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level , similar to pt doping , rh doping likely increases the area of fermi surface companying with the suppression of structural phase transition at high temperature .",
    "it should be noted that in pure irte@xmath2 , this phase transition might not be driven by the orbital - driven peierls transition.@xcite thus , the decrease of the area of fermi surface in irte@xmath2 at low temperature might not be due to the gapping of fermi surface originating from dw transition of ir atoms , but because of the reconstruction of fermi surface caused by the crystal field effect on te atoms.@xcite with further increase in rh content , the value of @xmath51 increases slightly to 6.46 mj / mol - k@xmath15 at @xmath57 0.2 , which is different from the pt doping where @xmath51 starts to decrease when @xmath58 0.04 .",
    "it is ascribed to the decrease of dos of irte@xmath2 above the fermi level and the shift the fermi level upward due to the partial substitution of pt for ir.@xcite in contrast , assuming that the rigid band model is valid , because rh is isovalent to ir , the substitution of rh into ir could have only minor effects on the fermi level , resulting in smaller changes of dos when compared to pt substitution . on the other hand , for @xmath6 ,",

    "the s(t ) curves for superconducting samples below about @xmath80 k and above 5 k are positive , linear and indistinguishable.@xcite this implies that the fermi surfaces do change somewhat as rh enters the lattice , but only until superconductivity sets in . together with the linear specific heat coefficient , this would imply that changes in the dos at the fermi level are visible only up to @xmath57 0.1 , whereas further isovalent substitution of rh on ir site does not change the shape of the fermi surface significantly .",
    "in summary , we found that rh substitution in ir@xmath0rh@xmath1te@xmath2 suppresses the first - order structural phase transition at high temperature . when @xmath81 0.15 , the structural phase transition is absent and superconductivity sets in .",
