    "circumstellar interaction models @xcite predict two characteristic phases in the evolution of a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) over timescales of a few decades . in the first few years , the outgoing shock front is expanding through the material deposited by stellar winds from the progenitor star . during this phase ,",
    "the radio and x - ray emission decline at a rate @xmath12 with @xmath13@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "after a few decades , the shock reaches the boundary with the interstellar medium ( sn remnant phase ) , and the luminosity decline flattens .",
    "thus , studying the evolution of an ageing sn , as it evolves towards the remnant stage , can provide information on the final few thousand years of evolution of the progenitor star .",
    "characteristic temperatures of the shocked gas are @xmath15@xmath16 kev , leading to emission in the soft x - ray band .",
    "soft thermal emission may not be the only source of x - rays in an ageing sn . a large fraction of core - collapse sne ( about 87% for a solar metallicity and a salpeter initial mass function ; heger et al .  2003 )",
    "is expected to leave behind a spinning , isolated neutron star .",
    "observations of known pulsars show that a fraction of the rotational energy loss @xmath17 is converted into x - ray radiation @xcite making many neutron stars visible as young x - ray pulsars , after the central region becomes optically thin ( a few decades ; chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "if most pulsars had millisecond periods at birth , they would constitute a substantial fraction of the population of x - ray point sources in star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "conversely , limits on the x - ray luminosities of a sizeble sample of young pulsars can be used to constrain their initial @xmath17 , and hence the distribution of their spin periods at birth @xcite .",
    "since very young sne have a substantial optical depth , for these studies it is especially important to gather a sample of ageing sne , and measure or constrain the x - ray luminosity of the pulsars possibly created in those events .",

    "hence , the x - ray luminosity of a sn at an age @xmath135 depends on the wind properties of the progenitor at an age @xmath136 before the explosion . for our fitted luminosity of sn1941c , using the numerical values from @xcite , we infer a mass - loss rate @xmath137 yr@xmath1 at @xmath138 yr before the sn . for sn1968d ( table 2 ) , the inferred mass - loss rate is @xmath139 yr@xmath1 at @xmath140 yr before the sn ; for sn1980k , @xmath141 yr@xmath1 at a time @xmath142 yr .",
    "more likely , these should be considered as an order of magnitude estimates .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and mass - loss rate of sn1968d suggest that this sn is evolving to a remnant similar to cas a @xcite .",
    "the similarity between sn1968d and cas a was also noted from radio observations @xcite .    in type - ii sne , the synchrotron radio emission is produced by electrons accelerated at the outgoing shock front , where the ionized circumstellar wind is compressed , and the magnetic field locked in it",
    "is amplified @xcite .",
    "thus , the radio luminosity is also a function of @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "however , a single radio measurement at late times is generally not sufficient to determine the mass - loss rate ; one has to know other parameters such as the density profile of the ejecta and the optical depth and flux at early times ( e.g. , 1 day after the explosion ) .",
    "of the four x - ray sne discussed here , 1980k is the only one for which a detailed radio lightcurve is available @xcite . from a detailed modelling of their data ,",
    "@xcite infer a mass - loss rate @xmath144 yr@xmath1 for the first 10 yrs after the sn , possibly declining to @xmath145 yr@xmath1 after that .",
    "this is in good agreement with the x - ray estimate .",
    "we found no published radio fluxes or limits for sn1941c .",
    "there are three upper limits for sn1959d , at @xmath146@xmath147 yrs after the explosion @xcite , and a radio detection for sn1968d , @xmath146 yrs after the event @xcite . in the absence of early - time data or detailed radio lightcurves ,",
    "it may still be possible to estimate @xmath132 , by using characteristic parameters from another sn assumed as a standard template ; for example , @xcite suggest an empirical formula based on the behaviour of sn1979c .",
    "using their formula , the stellar mass - loss rate for sn1959d would be @xmath148 yr@xmath1 , and @xmath149 yr@xmath1 for sn1968d , an order of magnitude less than estimated from the x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , we suspect that eck s scaling may under - estimate some mass - loss rates . for instance , the same relation gives @xmath150 yr@xmath1 for sn1980k , three times less than calculated from detailed radio modelling ; for sn1970 g , eck s formula implies @xmath151 yr@xmath1 while the x - ray estimate is @xmath152@xmath153 yr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the mass - loss rate is important not only to determine the type of progenitor star , but also to constrain the time of transition between the sn and sn remnant phase : the outgoing shock overtakes the stellar wind bubble and reaches the interstellar medium after a characteristic time @xmath154 yr @xcite .",
    "we leave a more detailed comparison of radio- and x - ray - inferred rates in sn1980k and other x - ray sne to further work .",
    "the presence of a power - law - like emission component above 2 kev in sn1968d suggests that there may be a contribution from a young pulsar and its wind nebula .",
    "we estimate an average power - law luminosity @xmath9 erg s@xmath1 , in the @xmath10@xmath11 kev band .",
    "interestingly , this is comparable to the luminosity of crab - like systems @xcite , and in particular the crab itself and psrb0540@xmath15569 @xcite .",
    "therefore , deep x - ray observations of sne older than about 30 years are optimally suited for the discovery of very young pulsars , and hence to constrain the statistics of pulsar formation , as well as the distribution of their spins at birth .",
