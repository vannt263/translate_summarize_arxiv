    "in the last two decades , much theoretical attention has directed towards understanding the dynamics of fission . according to reports",
    ", measuring the number of neutrons emitted during fission most likely gives information on the timescale of fission as well as on the nuclear dynamics .",
    "the transition state model of fission , based on appropriate level densities , predicts the widths ( and thus lifetimes ) of fission and neutron emission .",
    "this model is also suitable for determining the pre - fission neutron multiplicity if the calculated lifetimes are long compared to the dynamically constrained fission lifetime .",
    "several groups have invested an extensive effort in measuring the number of emitted neutrons associated with fission reactions induced by heavy ions [ 1 - 17 ] .",
    "the measurement of emitted neutrons is usually limited to the measurement of pre - scission neutron multiplicity , post - scission neutron multiplicity , and therefore total neutron multiplicity .",
    "these measurements show that the transition state model of fission leads to an underestimation of the number of measured pre - scission neutrons emitted in heavy ion induced fission at high excitation energies .",
    "this discrepancy can be related to the viscosity of the hot nucleus [ 18 ] .",
    "hence , the fission lifetime of a hot nucleus is substantially longer than that determined by statistical model of bohr and wheeler [ 19 ] . as a result",
    ", it is natural to expect that a dissipative dynamical model would provide an appropriate description of nuclear fission at high excitation energies [ 20 ] .",
    "pre - scission neutrons @xmath0 , can be emitted between the ground state of the compound nucleus and the saddle point ( pre - saddle neutrons ) @xmath1 , or between the saddle and the scission points ( saddle - to - scission neutrons ) @xmath2 .",
    "the number of pre - saddle neutrons as well as the number of saddle - to - scission neutrons can be determined by a combined dynamical statistical model ( cdsm ) [ 21 - 23 ] .",
    "the contributions @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the pre - scission neutron multiplicity are also estimated by a stochastic approach based on three - dimensional langevin equation [ 24 ] .",
    "recently , a more accurate four - dimensional langevin model as an extension of the three - dimensional langevin model by adding the fourth collective coordinate ( the projection of the total spin about the symmetry axis of the fissioning nucleus ) is used to calculate the pre - scission neutron multiplicity [ 25 ] .",
    "a common assumption in the calculation of the angular anisotropy of fission fragments using by the transition state model is that all pre - scission neutrons are emitted prior to reaching the saddle - point , since it is not straightforward to separate experimentally the contribution of neutrons being emitted before the saddle - point and those emitted between the saddle and the scission points [ 26 - 35 ] .",
    "it is well known that the standard saddle - point statistical model ( sspsm ) has become the standard theory of fission fragment angular distributions and received great success since it was proposed .",
    "the effect of neutron evaporation prior to reaching the saddle - point is to reduce the temperature of the fissioning nucleus which in turn increases the fission fragment anisotropy prediction by using this model .",
    "only @xmath1 has an influence over the prediction of angular anisotropy by using sspsm .",
    "the upper limit of the angular anisotropy of fission fragments , based on the prediction of sspsm is determined by assuming that all the pre - scission neutrons are emitted before the saddle - point .",
    "the pre - saddle neutrons as a crucial quantity in determining the angular anisotropy of fission fragments by using sspsm plays a main role , although any precise method to determine it has not been introduced . in this article , we calculate the number of pre - saddle neutrons by a novel method . in this method ,",
    "the values of @xmath1 for several induced fission reactions by light particles and heavy ions are determined by the fission fragments angular distribution method .",
    "this method is based on comparison between the experimental anisotropies and those predicted by the standard saddle - point statistical model .",
    "this method is limited to the calculation of pre - saddle neutrons in induced fission in which the angular anisotropy of fission fragments has a normal behavior , i.e. , it is observed a good agreement between the angular anisotropy of fission fragments and that predicted by the sspsm .    in order to make the present paper",
    "self - contained , we present in sec .",
    "ii , an brief description of the standard saddle - point statistical model as well as the calculating method of the pre - saddle neutron multiplicity on the basis of the sspsm in detail .",
    "section iii is devoted to the results obtained in this study . finally , the concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the standard transition - state model has been used to analyze the angular anisotropy of fission fragments in fission . in the transition - state model , the equilibrium distribution over the k degree of freedom ( the projection of total angular momentum of the compound nucleus ( ) on the symmetry axis of the fissioning nucleus )",
    "is assumed to be established at the transition state .",
    "two versions of the transition - state models based on assumptions on the position of the transition state : standard saddle - point statistical model ( sspsm ) , and scission - point statistical model ( spsm ) can be used for the prediction of fission fragment angular distributions .",
    "the basic assumption of the sspsm is that fission proceeds along the symmetry axis of a deformed compound nucleus , and that the distribution of k is frozen from the saddle point to the scission point . in this model ,",
    "the fission fragment angular distribution @xmath3 for the fission of spin zero nuclei is given by the following expression  @xcite    @xmath4j_{0}[-\\emph{i}p\\sin^2 { \\theta}]}{\\textrm{erf}[\\sqrt{2p}]}.\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the transmission coefficient for fission , and the zeroth - order bessel function , @xmath7 , and the variance of the equilibrium k distribution ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath9    here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the effective moment of inertia and the nuclear temperature of the compound nucleus at the saddle point , respectively .    the angular anisotropy of fission fragments is defined as @xmath12    the nuclear temperature of the compound nucleus at the saddle point is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the excitation energy of the fissioning system and @xmath15 is the nuclear level density parameter at the saddle point .",
    "@xmath14 can be expressed by the following relation @xmath16    in this equation , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath1 , and @xmath21 represent the center - of - mass energy of the projectile , the @xmath18 value , the spin dependent fission barrier height , the spin dependent rotational energy of the compound nucleus , the number of pre - saddle neutrons , and the average excitation energy lost due to evaporation of one neutron from the compound nucleus prior to the system reaching to the saddle point , respectively . in the case of @xmath22 , the angular anisotropy of fission fragments by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) is given by the following approximate relation @xmath23    the prediction of angular anisotropy of fission fragments by using the sspsm is valid only under restrictive assumptions . at high angular momentum , or at high fissility , the rotating liquid drop model ( rldm )",
    "predicts that the fission barrier height(@xmath19 ) vanishes even for a spherical nucleus , which leads to @xmath24 .",
    "subsequently , the distribution of k is uniform and hence the prediction of the sspsm for the fission fragments angular anisotropy is nearly uniform by using eq .",
    "this predicted tendency toward isotropy for fission fragments at high angular momentum is not seen in the experiments .",
    "this discrepancy is taken as a clear indication that the width of the k distribution is not determined at the predicted spherical saddle point shape , but at a point where nucleus is more deformed .",
    "therefore , it has been proposed that the standard saddle - point statistical model breaks down at high spin and/or large values of @xmath25 of the compound nucleus ( cn ) , and the angular distribution of fission fragments is governed by an effective transition state different from saddle point transition state .",
    "it is clear that because of the hindrance to fission , a large number of particles more that those predicted by the statistical model are emitted from the fissioning system . in heavy ion fusion reactions , due to the formation of a heavy compound nucleus",
    ", the competition between neutron emission and fission describes the decay possibilities rather well . during the collective motion to the scission point",
    ", neutrons will be evaporated if energetically possible , and would be experimentally as pre - fission , or more correctly , pre - scission neutrons . a longer saddle to scission time due to the viscosity effect , will result in a higher pre - scission neutron multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of pre - saddle neutrons in heavy ion induced reactions based on the comparison between the experimental data of angular anisotropy and those predicted by the sspsm depends on the kinetic energy and the binding energy of evaporated neutron from the compound nucleus prior to the system reaching to the saddle point .",
    "the energy spectrum of evaporated neutrons is usually given by the following form ( an evaporation spectrum )  @xcite @xmath26 hence , the average kinetic energy of the emitted neutron , @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 the average excitation energy lost due to evaporation of one neutron from the compound nucleus prior to the system reaching to the saddle point is given by @xmath29 where , @xmath30 denotes the average neutron separation energy .    in this work",
    ", the average energy lost by an emitted neutron over the energy range of the projectile is calculated by eq .",

    "hence , number of pre - saddle neutrons is not sensitive to the level density parameter selected in the calculation .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are accounted by the use of rotating finite range model ( rfrm )  @xcite , while @xmath36 quantities are calculated by several models [ 39 - 44 ] . in the following sections ,",

    ", it is determined pre - saddle neutron multiplicities for several systems undergoing heavy ion induced fission in which fission fragments angular anisotropies have a normal behavior as well as those systems undergoing light particle induced fission .",
    "in order to determine number of pre - saddle neutrons in heavy ion reactions with anomalous angular anisotropies , it is necessary to predict the average contribution of non compound nucleus fission events  @xcite .",

    "studied systems , the experimental data of angular anisotropy are taken from literature [ 46 , 47 ] . as illustrated in the figure , the number of pre - saddle neutrons decreases with increasing the excitation energy of the compound nucleus .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the fission barrier height ( and thus the ground state - to - saddle point transition time ) decreases with increasing the excitation energy of the compound nucleus , which can be lead to that @xmath1 decreases with @xmath14 . in this figure ,",

    "<S> pre - saddle neutron multiplicity has been calculated for several fission reactions induced by heavy ions and light particles . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , it is impossible to determine the contribution of neutrons being emitted before the saddle point and those emitted between the saddle and the scission points . </S>",
    "<S> determination of the pre - saddle neutron multiplicity in our research is based on the comparison between the experimental anisotropies and those predicted by the standard saddle - point statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the results shows that the pre - saddle neutron multiplicity depends on the fission barrier height and stability of the compound nucleus . in heavy ion </S>",
    "<S> induced fission , the number of pre - saddle neutrons decreases with increasing the excitation energy of the compound nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> a main cause of this behavior is due to a reduction in the ground state - to - saddle point transition time with increasing the excitation energy of the compound nucleus . whereas in induced fission by light particles , the number of pre - saddle neutrons increases with increasing the excitation energy of the compound nucleus . </S>"
