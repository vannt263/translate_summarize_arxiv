    "the mass of the pseudoscalar singlet meson , the @xmath0 , has long been the focus of theoretical study . it is more than 800mev heavier than the pion , a difference that has been attributed to disconnected quark loops@xcite , which are not present in the propagators of non - singlet states .",
    "lattice calculations using quenched wilson fermions @xcite , @xmath1 wilson @xcite , and @xmath1 staggered fermions @xcite , lend credence to this idea .    in the real world , there appears to be significant mixing between the singlet and the non - singlet mesons to form the @xmath2 and @xmath0 mass eigenstates . for lattice calculations to explain the observed pseudoscalar meson spectrum",
    ", it is therefore important to consider the effect of strange quarks as well as the two light flavors . in this paper",
    "we describe the very preliminary stages of the our efforts to study the @xmath2 and @xmath0 mesons using @xmath3 flavors ( two light degenerate flavors and one heavier `` strange '' flavor ) of staggered quarks .",
    "we also note that , as the disconnected diagrams inherent in the singlet propagator are sensitive to the sea quarks , flavor singlet studies may highlight any problems which the `` fourth - root trick '' introduces into the staggered sea .",
    "the difference between singlet and non - singlet pseudoscalar mesons is evident by looking at the expression for the singlet propagator .",
    "the general pseudoscalar @xmath4 propagator is : @xmath5^\\dagger\\sum_{j}^{n_f}\\overline{q}_j(x)\\gamma_5q_j(x)\\bigg\\rangle.\\ ] ] this expression contains terms of two types :    * for @xmath6 flavors , there are @xmath6 terms with contractions of fields from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . : @xmath9\\right.^\\dagger\\sum_{j}\\overline{q}_j}(x)\\gamma_5 q_j}(x ) \\bigg\\rangle\\ ] ] these terms appear in the propagators of both the singlet and non - singlet states .",
    "* @xmath10 terms from contractions of fields at the same space - time point + @xmath11^\\dagger\\sum_{j}\\overbrace{\\overline{q}_j(x)\\gamma_5q_j}(x)\\bigg\\rangle\\ ] ] these terms are present _ only _ in the flavor - singlet and distinguish the @xmath0 from the pion .",
    "they give rise to disconnected diagrams .",
    "to understand how the disconnected terms can contribute to an increase in the singlet mass relative to the non - singlet , it is instructive to expand the total singlet propagator in terms of pions with an effective coupling of @xmath12 .",
    "the first term , the connected term , is the pion propagator : @xmath13 following that is the disconnected piece , expanded as @xmath14 , where the @xmath15th term has @xmath16 _ sea _ quark loops ( pion propagators ) : @xmath17^{i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that the entire geometric series sums to a propagator with the mass squared shifted by @xmath18 :",
    "@xmath19^{i}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{p^2+m_\\pi^2+\\mu^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in addition to giving a perturbative explanation for the heavier mass of the @xmath0 , this expansion also illustrates the importance of sea quark loops in the @xmath0 propagator .      in euclidean configuration space , the connected piece eq .",
    "[ g0 ] should have exponential behavior : @xmath21 as should the total singlet propagator : @xmath22 so we expect the ratio of the disconnected correlator to connected correlator to behave as @xmath23    in a world without sea quarks  described by quenched lattice simulations  the momentum space expansion would terminate after @xmath24 ( eq [ g1 ] ) . in such a case",
    "the behavior of the @xmath20 ratio would instead be @xcite : @xmath25 the @xmath20 ratio is a useful tool to highlight any misbehavior on the part of the sea quarks in a lattice simulation . in simulations involving kogut - suskind staggered fermions the four native tastes of sea quark",
    "are reduced to a single flavor by means of the `` fourth - root trick '' .",
    "it is possible that replacing the determinant of the fermion matrix by the fourth - root of the determinant may introduce non - local terms in the action governing the fermion sea .",
    "measuring the @xmath20 ratio and looking for deviations from the form of eq .",
    "[ full_ratio ] would be a useful way to spot any inconsistencies between the actions governing the sea and valence quarks .",
    "one such inconsistency , albeit a mild one , is already known .",
    "the fourth - root trick is applied only to the sea quarks , reducing the number of flavors orbiting a sea quark loop by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "valence quark loops still have the native four tastes of staggered fermions orbiting . as connected correlators have a single valence loop and disconnected correlators have two valence quark loops , the ratio @xmath20 is naively too large by a factor of four for staggered fermions . in the numerical discussion following",
    ", we rescale implicitly all disconnected correlators by @xmath26 to correct for this .",
    "table [ config_table ] lists the gauge configuration ensembles on which we have to date measured pseudoscalar singlet connected and disconnected correlators .",
    "the @xmath27 configs were used to test our algorithms and were generated at the university of liverpool .",
    "the @xmath28 configurations are `` coarse '' milc lattices with @xmath29fm @xcite . all",
    "are produced with the `` asqtad '' improved action @xcite .",
