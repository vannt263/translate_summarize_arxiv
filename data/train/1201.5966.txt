    "observations of the sun provide an extraordinarily detailed snapshot of stellar structure and dynamics for a single set of physical properties and at a particular evolutionary state in the life of a star . to generalize our understanding of stellar evolution , and to evaluate the degree to which the sun is typical or peculiar , it is useful to examine other classes of stars . @xcite",
    "defined several such classes , including : _",
    "solar twins _ with fundamental physical properties very similar or identical to the sun ; _ solar analogs _ which are broadly comparable to the recent past and near future of the sun ; and _ solar - like stars _ including a wider range of f and g dwarfs and subgiants .",
    "well - known solar twins such as 18  sco @xcite provide some context for the sun observed as a star , while solar analogs like @xmath3  cet , @xmath4  hyi , and @xmath5  cen a & b @xcite help calibrate stellar evolution for stars that are younger , older , and more or less massive than the sun .",
    "broader studies of solar - like stars probe the full range of relevant stellar properties and evolutionary states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the bright stars 16  cyg  a & b ( @xmath6 hd  186408 & 186427 @xmath6 kic  12069424 & 12069449 ; v@xmath76 ) have long been studied as solar analogs , with estimated ages near 68  gyr @xcite .",
    "although they are members of a hierarchical triple system with a red dwarf companion that is 10 magnitudes fainter @xcite , there are no dynamical constraints on the masses because the available data suggest an orbital period longer than 18,000 years @xcite . after the discovery of a 1.5 jupiter - mass exoplanet in an eccentric 800-day orbit around 16  cyg  b @xcite , the system generated even more interest .",
    "since then , both components have been monitored for magnetic activity , showing long - term variations around a mean chromospheric activity level well below that of the sun at solar minimum ( j.  hall , private communication ) .",
    "so far there have been no direct measurements of rotation , but gyrochronology suggests that the rotation periods should be near 30 days @xcite . as two of the brightest stars in the _ kepler _ field of view , 16  cyg  a & b can now be subjected to a long - term study that promises to yield more detailed information than is currently available for any star but the sun .",

    "we describe the data analysis methods , and in  [ sec3 ] we present the asteroseismic modeling including an evaluation of both the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec4 ] with a discussion of the results and the potential for future studies utilizing the longer data sets that will soon become available .",
    "the first full quarter of short - cadence observations ( 58.85s sampling ; * ? ? ? * ) of 16  cyg a & b were obtained by _ kepler _ between september and december 2010 ( q7 ) .",
    "both stars are significantly brighter than the photometric saturation limit .",
    "saturated flux is conserved on _ kepler _ , so no photometric precision is lost for saturated targets as long as the saturated pixels are included in the pixel aperture .",
    "pixel apertures were not designed for such bright , saturated targets and in the case of 16  cyg contain a prohibitively large number of unneeded pixels .",
    "custom masks were therefore defined from q3 full frame images to capture all of the flux using fewer pixels .",
    "the raw photometric light - curves extracted from these masks @xcite were then prepared for asteroseismic analysis in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the power spectra of both stars ( 16  cyg  a in the left panels , and 16  cyg  b in the right panels ) .",
    "the top panels include boxcar smoothed power spectra ( in grey ) over an extended range in frequency , showing not only the gaussian - like power excess due to solar - like oscillations , but also contributions to the background power - spectral density attributable to granulation ( dashed lines ) , stellar activity and/or larger scales of granulation ( dot - dashed lines ) and shot noise ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the backgrounds were fit with a three - component model , comprising two harvey - like power laws @xcite to represent granulation and activity , and a flat component to represent the contribution of shot noise .",
    "the best - fitting sum of background components is shown as a solid black line in each panel .",
    "we note that the best - fitting timescales ( @xmath100  sec , @xmath101  sec ) and peak powers ( @xmath102  ppm@xmath103hz , @xmath104  ppm@xmath103hz ) of the granulation components are both slightly greater than the solar values estimated from sun - as - a - star observations , and follow the scaling relations derived by @xcite .",
    "the bottom panels show very clear patterns of peaks due to solar - like oscillations of high radial order , @xmath105 .",
    "the quality of the oscillation spectra are exquisite , with each star showing more than fifteen radial overtones including many octupole ( @xmath0=3 ) modes .",
    "the maximum peak height - to - background ratios are comparable to those observed in photometric sun - as - a - star data  the shot noise level is so low in these _ kepler _ data that the intrinsic stellar granulation noise dominates the background across the frequency ranges where the modes are observed .    ten teams provided estimates of the frequencies of the observed modes , applying _ peak - bagging _ techniques developed for application to corot @xcite and _ kepler _ data ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these techniques varied in the details of the optimizations performed  which included classical maximum - likelihood estimation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and markov chain monte carlo methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the number of free parameters and assumptions made for fits of lorentzian - like models to mode peaks in the power spectra .",
    "the results of the ten teams were analyzed to produce final frequency sets for each star .",
    "first , we sought to identify objectively those modes for which a robust , well - determined frequency could be estimated .",
    "this involved two types of checks . in one",
    ", we identified a list of modes with good agreement between the best - fitting frequencies from various teams .",
    "this was achieved using a modified version of the procedure outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a so - called _ minimal frequency set _ of modes was produced , for which a majority of the teams estimates were retained after applying peirce s criterion @xcite for outlier rejection .",
    "a second set of checks involved visual inspection of the frequency - power spectra ( and chelle diagrams of those spectra ) , combined with objective false alarm probability ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and likelihood ratio tests ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with a list of robust modes in hand , one of the teams",
    "was then selected to re - fit these modes in both stars using a single lorentzian profile per mode ( i.e.  no rotational splitting and the inclination angle fixed at 0@xmath106 ) .",
    "this team was chosen as the one whose initial best - fitting frequencies showed the closest match to the frequencies of the minimal - set .",
    "use of frequencies from one of the teams , as opposed to some average over all teams , meant that the modeling could rely on an easily reproducible set of input frequencies ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the set of oscillation modes from the peak - bagging analysis described in  [ sec2 ] included a total of 46 and 41 individual frequencies for 16  cyg  a & b , respectively . as inputs for the stellar modeling , we supplemented these asteroseismic constraints with the spectroscopic properties of each component derived by @xcite [ @xmath107  k , @xmath108 , [ fe / h]@xmath109 ; @xmath110  k , @xmath111 , [ fe / h]@xmath112 . using these @xmath113 values to obtain bolometric corrections from @xcite and adopting @xmath114 from @xcite , we combined the extinction estimates from @xcite with the updated hipparcos parallaxes @xcite to derive luminosity constraints : @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "we calculated separate values of @xmath117 for the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints and attempted to minimize them simultaneously using the asteroseismic modeling portal ( amp ; * ? ? ?",
    "this automated method uses a parallel genetic algorithm to search a broad range of stellar parameters and objectively determines the globally optimal model for a given set of observations .",
    "although 16  cyg  a & b are members of a binary system and presumably formed simultaneously from the same material , we fit each set of constraints independently and did not force the models to have a common age or initial composition .",
    "the oscillation frequencies of the optimal models for each star are plotted as red symbols in figure  [ fig2 ] , where the observed modes are shown as black points with horizontal error bars . in both cases ,",
    "the asteroseismic @xmath117 is less than 10 and the spectroscopic @xmath117 is less than 1 , so the models represent a reasonably good match to both sets of observational constraints . in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we list the optimal values for the radius ( @xmath118 ) and for the adjustable model parameters , including : the mass ( @xmath119 ) , age ( @xmath120 ) , initial metallicity ( @xmath121 ) and helium mass fraction ( @xmath122 ) , and the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath5 ) , along with the asteroseismic @xmath117 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on each parameter ( @xmath123 ) were determined using singular value decomposition .    to evaluate the possible sources of systematic uncertainty from the ingredients and assumptions in our models , six teams were given the results from amp and asked to reproduce the fit using the same set of observational constraints with their own stellar evolution codes and fitting methods .",
    "the physical ingredients adopted by each team differed slightly from those employed by amp , allowing us to explore the degree of model - dependence in our results . the optimal parameter values from each team are listed in table  [ tab2 ] , where we combine all of them into an adopted value ( bold row ) representing the average of the individual estimates weighted by @xmath124 . the systematic uncertainty ( @xmath125 ) on each parameter reflects the variance of the results , again weighted by @xmath124 .",

    "however , the results from different teams also include small offsets due to incomplete optimization  refined sampling of each adjustable parameter will always improve the fit , and there was no uniform criterion for when to stop fine tuning . to minimize the influence of this _ technique error _ on the final results",
    ", we weight the average parameter values and uncertainties using @xmath124 from each result as a proxy for the overall quality of the fit .",
    "this ensures that the variance reflects the actual systematic differences between model physics rather than the effort expended by each team in trying to match the observations . as with amp",
    ", most of the teams did not force any of the model parameters of 16  cyg  a & b to share a common value .",
    "the exceptions were the geneva code ( which forced a common age , initial composition and mixing - length ) , and yrec ( which forced the model for b to have the same age as the optimal model for a ) .",
    "excluding these models from the average does not significantly change the values of the adopted parameters listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the solar analogs 16  cyg  a & b using three months of observations from the _ kepler _ space telescope , yielding the highest quality asteroseismic data sets for any star but the sun ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we identify a total of 46 and 41 oscillation frequencies in the two components respectively , including a clear detection of octupole ( @xmath0=3 ) modes in both stars .",
    "these modes are difficult to detect in photometric data because the bright and dark patches associated with higher degree modes are normally expected to cancel in disk - integrated measurements .",
    "the unambiguous detection of such modes from the _ kepler _ light - curves of 16  cyg  a & b is a testament to the exceptional quality of the data .",
    "we derived the properties of each star independently by fitting stellar models to the oscillation frequencies ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) and other observational constraints ( see  [ sec3 ] ) simultaneously .",
    "the initial results from fitting each star individually using the asteroseismic modeling portal ( amp ; see figure  [ fig2 ] ) yield the same initial composition within the statistical uncertainties , and a similar age for the two components . further analysis using several stellar evolution codes employing a variety of input physics",
    "allows us to quantify the model - dependence of our results , and to adopt reliable values and uncertainties from the ensemble .",
    "the adopted stellar properties of 16  cyg  a & b ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) reinforce the conclusion that the two stars share a common age ( @xmath1  gyr ) and initial composition ( @xmath2 ) , as expected for a binary system but without imposing this as a constraint for the modeling .",
    "this fundamental result bolsters our confidence in the reliability of asteroseismic inferences of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the relative size of the statistical and systematic uncertainties provides an important benchmark for what we can expect from asteroseismology with the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on the stellar radii from amp were derived from the distribution of radii in an ensemble of models that differ from the optimal model by @xmath128 for each adjustable parameter .",
    "such estimates implicitly include the influence of parameter correlations , and are consequently much larger than the systematic variation in optimal radii from different stellar evolution codes .",
    "this is not the case for adjustable model parameters like the mass and age , where @xmath125 can be 24 times larger than @xmath123 , while the two are roughly comparable for the initial metallicity and helium mass fraction . the mixing - length parameter is a special case , because the range of estimates from different stellar evolution codes reflect variations in the solar - calibrated values that arise from differences in the input physics and in the specific formulation of mixing - length theory that is implemented in each code .",
    "thus , the systematic uncertainties on @xmath5 are likely to be overestimated , and small variations in the optimal value of this parameter from different codes should not be overinterpreted .",
    "these extraordinary results were possible using just the first three months of short - cadence observations ( q7 ) from _ kepler_. nine months of data will soon be available ( q7 - 8 - 9 ) , and the stars continue to be on the short - cadence target list  at least through q12 , and hopefully for the remainder of the mission .",
    "these longer data sets will gradually yield higher frequency precision and improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the power spectra , enabling further characterization of the stars from the current frequency sets and facilitating detection of additional oscillation modes at higher and lower frequencies .    from 69 months of data",
    "we may begin to resolve rotational splitting of the non - radial oscillation modes into multiple components with different azimuthal order , @xmath129 .",
    "the variation of this splitting as a function of the radial order @xmath105 can probe radial differential rotation , while the differences between non - radial modes with different spherical degree @xmath0 can reveal latitudinal variations .",
    "such measurements of rotation may help to constrain possible scenarios to explain the different li abundances of the two stars @xcite . with 1218 months of data",
    ", the frequency precision may be sufficient to resolve oscillatory signals in the deviations from uniform frequency spacing ( so - called second differences , @xmath130 ) which reflect the acoustic depths of sharp transitions in the stellar structure , such as the helium ionization region and the base of the surface convection zone .",
    "even longer data sets will allow us to probe the influence of stellar activity cycles , which lead to small anti - correlated changes in the frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillation modes . by the end of the baseline _ kepler _ mission , and hopefully through an extended mission , these two bright solar analogs promise to yield the clearest picture yet of the future of our own sun .",
