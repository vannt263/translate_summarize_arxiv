    "hence , if @xmath388 ( in schematical notation ) belongs to @xmath389 for a double cone @xmath211 , the vacuum modular flow takes it to linear combinations of ( f_tu)^n_1(f_tu)^n_2(f_tv)^m_1(f_tv)^m_2 with @xmath390 , @xmath391 .",
    "grouping the charged factors to neutral ( even ) `` bi - localized '' products , these generators belong to the local algebra of 6 double cones @xmath392 around 6 points as indicated in fig .  3 .    in spite of the fact that two of the 6 double cones @xmath393 lie outside @xmath394 , the corresponding algebras @xmath395",

    "therefore , in the geometric re - interpretation of boundary cft , the discrete mixing ( charge splitting ) on top of the geometric modular action induces a truely `` fuzzy '' action on bcft algebras associated with double cones @xmath211 !",
    "the fuzzyness seems , however , not to be described by a pseudo differential operator , as suggested in @xcite , but rather reflects the nonlocality of an operator product expansion for bi - localized fields .",
    "also in the general case of a local chiral net @xmath73 , there is a notion of `` charge splitting '' : superselection sectors are described by dhr endomorphisms of the local net , which are localized in some interval @xcite .",
    "intertwiners that change the interval of localization ( charge transporters ) are observables , i.e. , they do not carry a charge themselves , but they may be regarded as operators that annihilate a charge in one interval and create the same charge in another interval .",
    "these charge transporters do not belong to @xmath19 , but together with @xmath19 generate @xmath98 , see the discussion in @xcite .",

    "in particular , the modular unitaries will not belong to the diffeomorphism group , but we may expect that connes spatial derivatives as in prop .",
    "recall that we have already seen ( in the remark after ( [ mixdiff ] ) ) that mixing necessarily occurs . by ( i ) of prop .",
    "6 it is not possible that @xmath98 has geometric modular action without charge splitting .",
    "we have put into relation and contrasted the two facts that    \\(i ) in diffeomorphism covariant conformal quantum field theory there is a construction of states on the von neumann algebras of local observables associated with disconnected unions of @xmath8 intervals ( @xmath8-intervals ) , such that the modular group acts by diffeomorphisms of the intervals @xcite , and    \\(ii ) in the theory of free chiral fermi fields , the modular action of the vacuum state on @xmath8-interval algebras is given by a combination of a geometric flow with a `` mixing '' among the intervals @xcite .",
    "the absence of the mixing in ( i ) can be ascribed to the choice of `` product '' states in which quantum correlations across different intervals are suppressed .",
    "( in the re - interpretation of 2-interval algebras as double cone algebras in boundary conformal field theory @xcite , the influence of the boundary was shown to weaken  as expected on physical grounds  in the limit when the double cone is far away from the boundary @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be seen from the formula ( [ angle ] ) for the mixing angle that in this limit the mixing in ( ii ) also disappears . ) on the other hand , there is some freedom in the choice of product states , which allows to deform the geometric modular flow within each of the intervals .",
    "it comes therefore as a certain surprise that the geometric part of the vacuum modular flow in ( ii ) coincides with the purely geometric flow in the product states in ( i ) , precisely when the latter are chosen in a `` canonical '' way ( involving the simple function @xmath109 on the circle , corresponding to @xmath414 in ( [ nu - sol ] ) , in the case of symmetric @xmath8-intervals , and the function @xmath126 ( [ g ] ) in the general case ) .",
    "this means that the relative connes cocycle between the vacuum state and the `` canonical '' product state is just the mixing , while for all other product states , it will also involve a geometric component .      first , is the geometric part of the vacuum flow specific for the free fermi model , or is it universal ? and if it is universal , what takes the place of the mixing in the general case ?",
    "putting aside some technical complications of the proof , the authors of @xcite claim a universal behaviour for free fields , while in this paper , we have given first indications how the geometric behaviour should `` propagate '' to subtheories and to field extensions , also strongly supporting the idea of a universal behaviour .",
    "insight from the theory of superselection sectors suggests that the mixing in the general case should be replaced by a `` charge splitting '' . on the other hand ,",
    "takesaki s theorem poses obstructions against the idea that charge splitting on top of a geometric modular flow could be the general answer ( prop .",
    "second , the notion of `` canonical '' ( @xmath152=1 ) in the above should be given a physical meaning , related to the absence of a geometric component in the connes cocycle . in the free fermi case ,",
    "the geometric part of the modular hamiltonian contains the stress - energy tensor @xmath415 , while the mixing part can be expressed in terms of @xmath416 with @xmath417 and @xmath418 belonging to different intervals .",
    "the absence of derivatives suggests that the connes cocycle is `` more regular in the uv '' in the case when the geometric parts coincide , than in the general case .",
