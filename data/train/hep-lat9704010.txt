    "monte carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermions become very computationally intensive at small fermion masses due to the zero mass singularity of the dirac operator . in order to study theories with light fermions",
    "it becomes necessary to carry out simulations with relatively large bare masses , and then extrapolate back to lower values . in studying models with chiral symmetry or dynamical chiral symmetry breaking",
    "it would be desirable to simulate the models directly in the chiral limit , without having to introduce any bare mass terms which explicitly break the symmetry .",
    "a new approach to this problem has been suggested@xcite which does not explicitly break chiral symmetry .",
    "the idea is to add additional terms to the lattice action , corresponding to chiral invariant four - fermion interactions . in the continuum limit ,",
    "as the lattice spacing reduces to zero , these additional terms are irrelevant@xcite ( in the renormalization group sense ) .",
    "however , at finite lattice spacings they favor the generation of a dynamical fermion mass .",
    "this dynamical mass removes the singularity in the dirac operator allowing for simulations with exactly zero bare fermion masses@xcite .",
    "one particular area where this may soon lead to significant progress is in the study of qcd at finite density .",
    "it is generally expected that at some density greater than that of normal nuclear matter there is a transition to a quark - gluon plasma and chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the nature and order of this transition may be an important factor in cosmological models , neutron stars , and future heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "mean field calculations at both infinite@xcite and strong@xcite gauge coupling indicate that the transition is first - order at low temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , monte carlo simulations of qcd at non - zero density have not been able to give a physically accurate description of the transition@xcite",
    ".    quenched simulations of qcd using the grand canonical formulation@xcite show the transition at a value of the chemical potential equal to one half the pion mass , vanishing as the bare quark mass @xmath1 .",
    "these results are now understood@xcite to correspond to the @xmath2 limit of a theory of @xmath3 quarks with regular action and @xmath3 quarks with the conjugate action , and are therefore unrelated to qcd .",
    "unquenched monte carlo calculations have to deal with a complex fermionic determinant due to the introduction of the chemical potential .",
    "hence , conventional monte carlo algorithms can not be applied .",
    "some results have been obtained at infinite gauge coupling by representing the partition function in terms of monomers , dimers , and baryonic loops@xcite , and also on small lattices , by using a spectral density method@xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with mean field calculations .",
    "however , it is not clear how to extend these methods to intermediate or weak gauge coupling .",
    "the evaluation of the complex determinant can also be avoided by the fugacity expansion method of refs .",
    "however , the proper physics of chiral symmetry breaking , with a massless pion , has not yet been achieved using finite quark masses with this method@xcite .",
