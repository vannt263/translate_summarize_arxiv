    "it is well known that charged particles with nonzero spin can interact with the electromagnetic field not only via the monopole but also through higher order multipoles . though these particles do receive contributions beyond the monopole at the tree level , it is interesting to investigate those contributions arising from quantum fluctuations as they can be sensitive to new physics effects . in particular , the static electromagnetic properties of charged vector bosons",
    "are parametrized by four loop - generated electromagnetic form factors : two cp - even ones ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and two cp - odd ones ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the cp - even form factors define the ( anomalous ) magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the vector boson , whereas the cp - odd ones parametrize its electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments .",
    "these form factors are model dependent and can only be generated at the one - loop level or higher orders .",
    "for instance , in the case of the charged @xmath6 gauge boson of the standard model ( sm ) , only the cp - even quantities are generated at the one - loop level @xcite , whereas the cp - odd ones can only be induced at higher orders @xcite .",
    "because of their sensitivity to new physics effects , the electromagnetic properties of the @xmath6 boson have been the subject of considerable interest and have been studied in many extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "as far as neutral particles are concerned , by time - reversal invariance they can not have static electromagnetic properties as long as they are characterized by self - conjugate fields , in which case the particle coincides with the antiparticle .",
    "this is true for instance for massive majorana neutrinos @xcite and the neutral gauge boson of the sm @xcite , which only have off - shell electromagnetic properties .",
    "the situation is different for neutral particles characterized by no self - conjugate fields , in which case the particle does not coincides with the antiparticle .",
    "for instance , massive dirac neutrinos @xcite or complex neutral vector bosons @xcite do can have static electromagnetic properties .",
    "in contrast with the case of charged particles , the electromagnetic properties of neutral no self - conjugate particles can only arise from quantum fluctuations , thereby being rather sensitive to virtual effects from new particles .",
    "even though neutral self - conjugate vector bosons are not predicted by the sm , they can arise in some of its extensions @xcite and so it is interesting to study their static electromagnetic properties .",
    "although the @xmath7 vertex can receive contributions from fermion , boson and scalar loops , we will concentrate only on the fermion contributions .",
    "the reason for this choice is that in most of the renormalizable theories the boson or scalar particles can not generate any cp - odd form factor at the one - loop level @xcite , whereas both the cp - even and cp - odd form factors do can be generated at this order by left- and right - handed fermions .",
    "this means that , the cp - odd form factors will be entirely determined by the fermion contribution in most of the renormalizable theories . in addition , while the couplings of @xmath0 to gauge boson or scalar pairs would be more model - dependent , a renormalizable coupling of @xmath0 to a fermion pair can be proposed by minimal substitution .",
    "this paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cal ] the calculation of the amplitude is presented .",
    "[ dis ] is devoted to analyze the behavior of the electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 boson in diverse scenarios of the fermion masses .",
    "emphasis is given to the properties of the form factors in the context of the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "according to the notation shown in figure 1 , the most general on - shell @xmath8 vertex can be written as @xcite @xmath9 + 2\\delta \\kappa_v ( q_\\beta g_{\\alpha \\mu}-q_\\alpha g_{\\beta \\mu})\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{4\\delta q_v}{m^2_{v}}p_\\mu q_\\alpha q_\\beta + 2\\delta \\widetilde{\\kappa}_v\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\lambda}q^\\lambda+\\frac{4\\delta \\widetilde{q}_v}{m^2_{v}}q_\\beta \\epsilon_{\\alpha \\mu \\lambda \\rho}p^\\lambda q^\\rho\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of a neutral vector boson , the @xmath10 coefficient vanishes at any order of perturbation theory since it violates gauge invariance .",
    "the magnetic ( electric ) dipole moment @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and the electric ( magnetic ) quadrupole moment @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are given in terms of the electromagnetic form factors as follows @xmath15     vertex .",
    "the large dot represents the virtual effects of left- and right - handed fermions.,width=240 ]    as for the fermion contribution , it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the only fermion interaction that can contribute to the on - shell @xmath8 vertex at the one - loop level is the following fermion - gauge coupling : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are arbitrary complex parameters .",
    "we will present a general calculation and then discuss some specific scenarios , in particular that of a neutral no self - conjugate vector boson .",
    "the contribution of the fermion pair ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) to the @xmath7 vertex is given by the two feynman diagrams shown in figure 2 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath21 and @xmath22 the charges of the fermions circulating in the loop .",
    "the charge of the @xmath0 boson is thus @xmath23 .",
    "the respective amplitude can be written down readily and the loop integral can be solved via the feynman parameter technique . below we will present separately the results for the cp - even and cp - odd form factors .",
    "@xmath24 is a fermion with left- and right - handed couplings to the arbitrarily charged @xmath0 boson.,width=384 ]      once the integration over the arbitrary momentum is done , the following cp - even form factors are obtained @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a parametric integral depending on @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have omitted a possible color factor , which should be inserted when appropriate .",
    "@xmath30 stands for an additional term in which the interchanges @xmath31 and @xmath32 are to be made .",
    "the parametric integrals read    @xmath33    with @xmath34    @xmath35    as for @xmath10 , it is zero provided that @xmath36 , _",
    "i.e. _ for a neutral no self - conjugate vector boson @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath10 is associated with a coupling of the vector boson to the photon , which is induced by the covariant derivative , this result reflects the fact that a neutral particle can couple to the photon only through the field tensor @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude for the @xmath38 coupling is nonzero and free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "after some algebra , the parametric integrals can be solved explicitly : @xmath39 @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 functions are given by @xmath45 @xmath46    @xmath47    with @xmath48 @xmath49 both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are antisymmetric under the interchange @xmath52 .",
    "the feynman parameter technique yield @xmath53 where    @xmath54    we have used shouten s identity to eliminate any redundant term .",
    "the form factor @xmath4 can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 this result is in agreement with that obtained in reference @xcite for the case of the @xmath6 gauge boson in the context of left - right symmetric models . from equation ( [ delta_k_t ] ) we can see that @xmath57 is symmetric under the interchange @xmath58 .",
    "notice that there is no fermion contribution to @xmath59 at the one - loop level , which means that the electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments arising from fermion loops are entirely determined by @xmath60 .",
    "this property was first noted in reference @xcite for a charged @xmath6 boson with left- and right - handed couplings to fermions . we have shown that this result is valid in general , regardless the charge of the gauge boson .",
    "there follows that the fermion contribution to @xmath61 is directly proportional to @xmath14 at the one - loop level in any renormalizable theory : @xmath62      one interesting case is that of a no self - conjugate neutral gauge boson @xmath1 . from the above expressions , one can readily obtain the results for this case once the replacement @xmath63",
    "is done :    @xmath64    where @xmath65    it is clear that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are antisymmetric under the interchange @xmath68 , whereas @xmath69 is symmetric .",
    "as a consequence the cp - even form factors of a neutral no self - conjugate boson vanish when the fermion masses are degenerate .",
    "in this section we will analyze the behavior of the form factors in the decoupling limit of the fermion masses . since",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are associated with lorentz structures that arise from dimension - four operators , it is expected that they are sensitive to nondecoupling effects of heavy physics . on the other hand @xmath72 and @xmath73 can not be sensitive to this class of effects since they are associated with a lorentz structure generated by a nonrenormalizable dimension - six operator @xcite . in order to analyze the decoupling properties of the form factors of the @xmath0 boson",
    ", we will focus on the loop amplitudes @xmath42 , @xmath74 , @xmath44 , and @xmath75 rather than in the form factors themselves .",
    "we will thus not make any assumption about the values of the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the electric charges @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which indeed are model dependent .",
    "the loop amplitudes are given in terms of the parametric integrals @xmath27 as follows : @xmath42 depends on @xmath76 , @xmath43 on @xmath77 , @xmath44 on @xmath78 , and @xmath75 on @xmath79 . from the analysis of these integrals",
    "we will be able to draw some general conclusions .",
    "it is thus not necessary to consider those terms obtained after making the replacement @xmath58 .    to find whether or not any heavy physics effect is present in the loop amplitudes and found the sources of nondecoupling effects",
    ", it is convenient to analyze the behavior of the parametric integrals @xmath27 in the heavy fermion limit .",
    "these integrals are given in terms of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "it is evident that any integral depending on @xmath80 vanishes as @xmath84 when @xmath85 , with @xmath86 either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "this is true for @xmath78 , which means that @xmath87 is insensitive to the effects of heavy fermions as it only depends on this integral .",
    "now consider the term @xmath83 .",
    "it can be shown that the respective integral tends to a nonzero constant value when @xmath88 or @xmath89 , and vanishes when both @xmath28 and @xmath29 become large .",
    "it follows that those integrals depending logarithmically on @xmath90 are sensitive to heavy fermions when either @xmath28 or @xmath29 is made large and the other one is kept fixed .",
    "let us now analyze the behavior of the term @xmath91 , which also contribute to @xmath76 .",
    "when @xmath28 becomes large and @xmath29 remains small , @xmath92 , but in the opposite case it tends to a constant value .",
    "of course when both @xmath28 and @xmath29 become heavy , @xmath81 tend to a nonzero constant .",
    "therefore , the integral @xmath76 is sensitive to nondecoupling effects when both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are heavy or when either @xmath28 or @xmath29 is heavy .",
    "finally , let us discuss the behavior of the term @xmath93 , which enters into the integrals @xmath94 and @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath95 both @xmath94 and @xmath79 decrease as @xmath96 and vice versa .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath97 , these integrals tend to a nonzero constant value .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 and @xmath75 are sensitive to nondecoupling effects only when the fermions are degenerate , in contrast with @xmath42 , which always is sensitive to heavy fermions .    in summary , @xmath87 is always insensitive to nondecoupling effects , @xmath98 and @xmath75 are sensitive to heavy fermions only when the fermion masses are degenerate , and @xmath99 is sensitive to nondecoupling effects in both the degenerate and nondegenerate scenarios .",
    "this is illustrated graphically in figure [ func ] .",
    "we thus can conclude that while @xmath100 is sensitive to heavy fermion effects , @xmath72 is always of decoupling nature .",
    "as far as @xmath71 is concerned , it is sensitive to nondecoupling effects provided that the fermion masses are degenerate .",
    "all these results are in accordance with the decoupling theorem @xcite , which establishes that only those lorentz structures arising from renormalizable operators can be sensitive to nondecoupling effects , whereas those structures coming from nonrenormalizable operators are suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy mass . in most of the theories , the nondecoupling effects are unobservable since they are absorbed by renormalization @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is worth analyzing separately the specific case of a neutral no self - conjugate vector boson . from equations ( 7 ) and (",
    "8) it is clear that the cp - even form factors vanish when @xmath101 and @xmath102 since they are antisymmetric under this interchange . in the case that @xmath103 , @xmath66 is sensitive to nondecoupling effects when either @xmath104 or @xmath105 , and the same is true for @xmath71 . as far as @xmath51 is concerned , it is of decoupled nature and vanishes when either @xmath106 or @xmath107 are heavy .",
    "the latter form factor goes to zero rapidly in the heavy fermion limit .",
    "although the actual size of these form factor is model dependent , we can infer their order of magnitude from the analysis of the loop functions . in figure [ func ]",
    "we show these loop functions in three scenarios of interest : @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the first two scenarios corresponds to the case of a fermion with mass of the order of @xmath113 , whereas the third one corresponds to the case of degenerate fermions . from these figures",
    "we can see that @xmath99 , @xmath98 and @xmath75 can be of the order of @xmath114 , whereas @xmath115 is one or two orders of magnitude below .",
    "thus if there is no large cancellations , @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be at most of the order of @xmath118 , whereas @xmath3 is one or two orders of magnitude below .",
    "however , @xmath117 requires that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonzero and may be further suppressed .",
    "let us now analyze the static quantities of the @xmath0 boson in two scenarios of interest . in particular , we will obtain explicit expressions for the form factors in the massless fermion and heavy fermion limits . in the first scenario",
    "we assume that there is degeneracy of the fermion masses and in the second case we assume @xmath119 and @xmath107 arbitrary , which implies that one fermion is massless or much lighter than the other one .",
    "we rewrite the static quantities of the @xmath0 boson as    @xmath120    @xmath121    and @xmath122    in the scenario with degenerate fermions ( @xmath112 ) we obtain    @xmath123    some conclusions can be drawn from these expressions .",
    "first of all , @xmath124 is constant , which means that @xmath70 always receives a contribution from a degenerate fermion doublet , regardless the value of the fermion mass .",
    "notice also that @xmath125 vanishes for @xmath126 , whereas @xmath127 takes the value @xmath128 .",
    "from here we can recover the known result for the contribution from massless fermions to the static quantities of the @xmath6 boson in the sm @xcite . in the heavy fermion limit , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which is also in accordance with the previous discussion .",
    "as for the cp - odd form factor @xmath131 , it vanishes when @xmath126 and tends to @xmath132 in the heavy fermion limit .",
    "it means that @xmath133 is insensitive to massless fermions but sensitive to a heavy degenerate fermion doublet . from equations ( [ abar])-([fbar ] )",
    "it is also clear that in this scenario there are no contributions to the cp - even form factors of a neutral @xmath1 boson , whereas the cp - odd contribution is nonzero .",
    "this result is independent of the fermion mass .",
    "let us now consider the scenario with nondegenerate fermions ( @xmath134 ) . without losing generality",
    "we consider @xmath119 and @xmath111 .",
    "we obtain @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the heavy - mass limit , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which again is in agreement with the previous discussion .",
    "as long as the cp - odd amplitude is concerned , there is no contribution to @xmath139 in this scenario as it vanishes when either @xmath140 or @xmath119 .",
    "the respective expressions for a neutral vector boson can be readily obtained after the replacement @xmath63 is done : @xmath141 in the heavy - mass limit , @xmath142 and @xmath143 . of course when @xmath126 , the degenerate fermion case is recovered and there is no contributions to the cp - even form factors .",
    "we presented a comprehensive study of the one - loop fermion contributions to the static electromagnetic properties of a no self - conjugate vector boson with arbitrary electric charge .",
    "a renormalizable coupling of the @xmath0 boson to left- and right - handed fermions was assumed .",
    "analytical expressions for the respective form factors were presented in the general case and some scenarios of interest , which can be used to evaluate the fermion contribution in the context of any renormalizable theory predicting this class of interactions .",
    "apart from the two cp - even form factors , the fermion loop gives rise to only one cp - odd form factor , namely @xmath71 . as a consequence , the contributions to",
    "the electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments turn out to be directly proportional to each other .",
    "this result is valid for any no self - conjugate vector boson , regardless its electric charge . as for the cp - odd form factor @xmath144",
    ", it turns out to be proportional to @xmath145 , thereby requiring the presence of both left- and right - handed fermions .",
    "the behavior of the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath0 boson was analyzed in several scenarios .",
    "particular emphasis was given to the heavy fermion limit , and the consistency with the decoupling theorem was discussed . as for the cp - even form factors , it was shown that @xmath100 is sensitive to heavy fermions , whereas @xmath72 is always of decoupling nature .",
    "the latter decreases rapidly , as @xmath146 , when the heavier fermion mass @xmath86 increases , which means that it is only sensitive to physics effects which are not very far from the @xmath113 scale .",
    "the cp - odd quantity @xmath71 is sensitive to heavy fermions provided that the fermions are degenerate , whereas in a nondegenerate scenario it decreases as @xmath147 .",
    "it was also found that for fermion masses near the @xmath113 scale , the loop amplitudes associated with @xmath100 and @xmath144 are of the same order of magnitude , but the one associated with @xmath72 is one order of magnitude below .",
    "since the @xmath71 form factor requires the presence of both left - handed and right - handed fermions , it depends strongly on the existence of a complex phase , which is expected to be very small in most of the renormalizable theories .",
    "we would like to emphasize that all the above remarks are valid regardless the electric charge of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "an interesting case is that of a neutral no self - conjugate vector boson , for which explicit analytical expressions were obtained . in particular , it was found that there is no contribution to the cp - even form factor of the neutral vector boson when the fermion masses are degenerate , in contrast to the cp - odd form factor , which is nonzero in this scenario .",
