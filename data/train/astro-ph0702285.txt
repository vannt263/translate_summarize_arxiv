    "the foundations of modern infrared photometry at near - infrared wavelengths ( 1 - 5 @xmath0 m ) were built upon the pioneering work of johnson and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared filters used in these early works were very broad , and the atmospheric absorption bands defined the effective widths of the filters .",
    "the filter profiles used by @xcite are shown in figure 1 , which demonstrates that the deep atmospheric absorption bands ( mostly due to water vapor ) play a significant role in determining the effective transmission of the atmosphere + telescope + filter observational system .",
    "the problem with allowing the atmosphere to define the passband is that the atmosphere varies substantially from place to place and , at any given location , from night to night ( even from hour to hour ) .",
    "hence , the reproducibility of photometric observations and conversions to other photometric systems becomes difficult or impossible to achieve . to prevent these problems ,",
    "the photometric bands should ideally be defined by only the filter transmission profiles ( if possible ) .",
    "ideally , the filter bandpasses should avoid deep telluric absorption features and any part of the telluric spectrum that has a large first derivative and/or is highly variable . in principle , filter properties can be controlled by the manufacturer , and so the specifications and characteristics of the filters are usually the only aspect of the observational system that can remain constant from instrument to instrument and site to site .",
    "if such a set of filters were easily replicable and distributed to a large number of observatories , the comparison of photometric results from various instruments , telescopes , and sites would be much more straightforward .",
    "there has never been an agreed upon filter set for the ground - based near - infrared filters . as a result , many types of filters are currently used , as illustrated in figure 2 , and summaries of infrared photometric systems in use are given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "( the former two references also provide excellent introductions to infrared photometry . ) as a result of this proliferation of filter sets , the comparison of results in different systems can be quite complicated .",
    "careful attention to the details of the photometric system employed such as that provided by @xcite and @xcite is needed .",
    "furthermore , the labels for the filters in different sets are often the same ( e.g. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) , and this can lead the unwary to mistakenly combine or compare results inappropriately .",
    "very different filters may have been used for observations despite the common label , and corrections for the differing filter ( isophotal ) wavelengths must be incorporated first before comparisons can be done . for objects with very deep absorption bands or strong emission lines ,",
    "direct comparison may not be possible .",
    "the basic difficulty of having different filters lies in the intercomparison of results from the various photometric systems . in order to make accurate comparisons ,",
    "all of the photometric points must be either ( 1 ) plotted at the filter wavelengths of the various systems , or ( 2 ) corrected to the same wavelength .",
    "the latter is the purpose behind color transformations .",
    "intercomparison of results among the different systems requires color transformations such as those provided by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the large number of color transformations highlights the need for standardization of infrared filters . as stated in the goals for this workshop : `` the astronomical community witnesses an explosive non - linear growth of observational capability  this quantum leap and its associated uncontrolled production of diverse systems of measurement disrupts the consistency of calibrated measurements  '' .",
    "figure 2 serves as a fitting testimony to the relevance of these statements .",
    "although color transformations are very helpful in combining data from different systems , the systematic effects and limited color range of the transformations make it much less desirable than having observations with a single filter set .",
    "the adoption of a standard filter set would minimize confusion about which filter set is being used and the magnitude of the color transformations . however , use of a single filter set will not eliminate the need for color transformations due to optical efficiency differences among instruments and because completely identical filters can not be fabricated for all photometric systems .    a relatively new set of filters , the mauna kea observatories near - infrared ( mko - nir ) filter set , was designed for minimizing the atmospheric absorption effects .",
    "the filter profiles are shown in figure 1 .",
    "these filters are located near the center of the high atmospheric transmission regions , and therefore the filter central wavelengths are defined by these regions .",
    "we present here a brief summary of the properties of the mko - nir filter set .",
    "this filter set is gaining acceptance in the community and thus could serve as a unified near - infrared filter set in the future .",
    "we also discuss aspects of infrared photometry that may be helpful to newcomers to infrared photometry , and we discuss a method to establish an improved photometric system for the mko - nir filter set .",
    "a filter set for 15 @xmath0 m was developed initially for the subaru and gemini telescopes .",
    "the central wavelength and bandpass were optimized by maximizing throughput while minimizing the effects of the atmospheric transmission and emission .",
    "the method to determine this was presented by @xcite .",
    "the 19962002 period was an opportune time to convince many other groups to use these filters , since there were a large number of new infrared instruments under development at the time .",
    "there was a strong motivation to combine orders for production , thus sharing the engineering and fabrication costs and thus greatly reducing the cost per filter .",
    "in addition , the filters were optimized at both 2 and 4 km altitude , and thus many observatories could use these filters . as a result",
    "these filters are now widely used at a large number of major observatories and are being employed in near - infrared sky surveys such as the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) .",
    "the detailed specifications for the fabrication of the filters and atmospheric extinction coefficients are described by @xcite , while the isophotol wavelengths ( for a vega source spectrum ) and absolute calibration are described by @xcite .",
    "there is no unique definition of the `` effective wavelength '' of a broad - band filter .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for detailed discussions of the various filter definitions .",
    "the fundamental problem is that the filters are broad relative to the wavelength scale of the variations in the source spectra .",
    "in contrast a single pixel in a spectrograph is like a filter with a very well defined wavelength simply because its wavelength span is small compared with the variations in the spectra in most sources .    as we show below",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the isophotal wavelength is the most appropriate filter wavelength definition to use .",
    "this definition is _ not _ independent of the source spectrum , which presents problems , and is the reason others have used different filter wavelength definitions in an attempt to approximate the isophotal wavelength without having to incorporate the source spectrum .",
    "to derive an expression for the isophotal wavelength we first consider the number of photo - electrons detected per second from a source with an intrinsic spectral energy distribution @xmath4 .",
    "this is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total system response given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the atmospheric transmission , @xmath9 is the product of the throughput of the telescope , instrument , and quantum efficiency of the detector , @xmath10 is the filter response function , and @xmath11 is the telescope collecting area .",
    "the system response @xmath6 is equal to the relative spectral response ( rsr ) defined by @xcite .",
    "care is needed when taking filter response functions from various sources .",
    "for example , the 2mass filter response functions have already been corrected for the extra factor of @xmath12 in the integral @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath6 are both continuous , and @xmath6 is not negative over the wavelength interval , then from equation ( 2 ) and the mean value theorem for integration there exists a wavelength , @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 rearranging this , we obtain @xmath15 where @xmath13 is known as the  isophotal wavelength \" and @xmath16 denotes the mean value of the intrinsic flux above the atmosphere ( in units of w m@xmath17 @xmath0m@xmath18 ) over the wavelength interval of the filter .    in a similar fashion , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the `` isophotal frequency '' and",
    "@xmath21 denotes the mean value of the intrinsic flux above the atmosphere ( in units w m@xmath17 hz@xmath18 ) over the frequency interval of the filter .",
    "the isophotal wavelengths and frequencies , @xmath13 and @xmath20 , respectively , for the mko - nir filters are given in table 1 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these were computed using the model atmosphere for vega recommended by @xcite and therefore strictly apply only to a0v stars . for any other source spectrum",
    ", the isophotal wavelengths would differ from those shown in table 1 .",
    "the isophotal wavelength is important and useful because it is the wavelength at which the monochromatic flux @xmath22 equals the mean flux in the passband . as stated succinctly by @xcite : `` the wavelength of the monochromatic intensity deduced from a heterochromatic measurement  is  @xmath23 . ''",
    "the use of isophotal wavelengths determined from a model of vega provides consistency with the extensive series of papers on infrared calibration by cohen and his collaborators .",
    "other definitions for the filter wavelength are discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that the ukidss program defined filters for @xmath24 and @xmath25 with effective wavelengths at 0.88 @xmath0 m and 1.03 @xmath0 m respectively , @xcite .",
    "it is typically the case that the longest filter for ccd work is named `` @xmath24 '' .",
    "the `` @xmath25 '' filter was introduced by @xcite to take advantage of the atmospheric window between atmospheric absorption at 0.955 and 1.112 @xmath0 m .",
    "the definition of the effective wavelength adopted by the sloan digital sky survey as well as the ukidss @xcite is given by ( * ? ? ? * see their equation 3 ) and is not that of the isophotal wavelength for an a0v star .",
    "therefore , the flux densities in hewett et al.s table 7 , which correspond to the flux densities of an object of zero magnitude of constant flux density over the passband , are not the monochromatic flux densities at the effective wavelengths given in their table . thus , while the flux density zero points agree well with those given in table 1 , direct comparison of the wavelengths in table 1 with that of hewett et al.s table 7 is not appropriate .",
    "photometric data points are often converted to flux densities and interpreted as measurements of the monochromatic flux at wavelengths given by the `` effective wavelengths '' of the filters , such as the isophotal wavelengths .",
    "however , what one has measured is the `` in - band '' flux passing through the filter . since photometry is unavoidably a heterochromatic ( multiwavelength ) measurement , observations of sources with very different spectral energy distributions",
    "can not be directly compared at a single wavelength unless a correction is made for the different spectral energy distributions .",
    "this is clear from the definition of the isophotal wavelength , where the spectral energy distribution must be known to compute it .",
    "the dependence of the isophotal wavelength on the source spectrum is the fundamental reason for the difficulties encountered in the interpretation and intercomparison of photometric results . to accurately know the wavelength at which a photometric data point applies",
    ", one needs to know the source spectrum , which is usually what one is attempting to determine in the first place .",
    "the application of a correction factor during photometric reductions is a means of attempting to account for the sensitivity of @xmath26 to the slope of the source spectrum , and thereby estimating the monochromatic source flux density at the isophotal wavelength of an a0v star .    to visualize this ,",
    "consider the observation of a very cool object , say @xmath27  k. suppose the standard star is much hotter , @xmath28 k. then the isophotal wavelength of the standard is inappropriate for the cool object since the flux density is weighted to the longer wavelengths compared to the standard star .",
    "if a correction is not made for the spectral energy distribution , then one will overestimate the flux density of the cool object at the isophotal wavelength of the standard . to obtain the proper flux density of the cool object at the isophotal wavelength of the standard one",
    "must apply a correction factor that reduces the flux density of the cool object .",
    "these correction factors are required for any definition of the filter wavelength , including those that are independent of the source spectrum .",
    "discussions of computing the correction factor can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all photometry is relative , and so it is necessary to define the photometric zero point by using a star or group of stars to define zero magnitude and zero colors . in establishing the @xmath29 system ,",
    "@xcite tied the @xmath30 magnitude to nine stars of the international photovisual system and the @xmath31 and @xmath32 colors to an average of six a0v stars .",
    "most optical photometric systems assume a visual magnitude of @xmath330.03 for vega .",
    "however most infrared photometric systems , such as @xcite for the c.i.t . system and @xcite for his absolute calibration work ,",
    "define vega to have zero magnitude and zero color at 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "more recently @xcite have chosen to tie the msx photometry to sirius since vega has dust emission that affects its brightness at wavelengths longer than 12 @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , in comparing near - infrared photometric systems , care is required to make sure that the assumptions about the visual and infrared magnitude of vega are consistent .",
    "@xcite assumed 0.0 mag for vega in the near - infrared , but in @xcite the nonzero magnitude of vega at @xmath30 was taken into account in establishing the 0.0 mag flux densities ( see their table 3 ) .",
    "vega is the most well - studied star for the determination of the absolute flux density .",
    "a summary of the direct comparison of blackbody furnaces to vega is given by @xcite , while @xcite used a model atmosphere to extrapolate from the absolute calibration at @xmath30 to the near infrared .",
    "@xcite show that these two methods give the identical flux density in the near - infrared .",
    "the flux density for vega shown in table 1 is from @xcite , and it is normalized to be consistent with the flux density of vega determined by @xcite . @xcite have shown that these values are consistent with the model - independent absolute calibration measurements summarized by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the absolute calibration of @xcite was found to be consistent with the extensive absolute calibration conducted by the _ midcourse space experiment _",
    "@xcite to within 1% .",
    "therefore the values shown in table 1 are consistent with the extensive absolute calibration work of cohen and his collaborators , of which @xcite is the latest in the series .",
    "nevertheless , the use of a model atmosphere for vega is fraught with difficulties because vega is a rapid rotator and is observed nearly pole - on @xcite .",
    "consequently there is a temperature gradient across the surface of vega as viewed from earth .",
    "therefore , a model atmosphere with a single fixed temperature can not provide an accurate representation of the observed flux density of vega from the ultraviolet to the near - infrared .",
    "in fact , there is no self - consistent model of vega that is applicable from the optical to the infrared .",
    "nonetheless , the single temperature model assumed by @xcite provides a close approximation to the near - infrared spectral energy distribution that we observe and has been validated by ground - based and space - based absolute calibration experiments .",
    "this does not imply the model atmosphere is a valid one but rather that the model atmosphere is empirically a good match to the near - infrared spectral energy distribution of vega .",
    "in establishing the @xmath29 system @xcite employed the technique of linearly extrapolating magnitudes to above the atmosphere .",
    "a strictly linear extrapolation is not valid due to the forbes effect ; the atmospheric extinction curve is nonlinear between zero and unity airmass . this is shown explicitly for the mko - nir filters in figure 3 .",
    "the nonlinearity of the extinction in the near - infrared passbands was discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "2 ) , @xcite , and @xcite and arises from the very strong absorption bands of water vapor in the near - infrared . as a result ,",
    "all commonly used near - infrared photometric systems ( glass , elias , persson , ukirt ) employ the method of reducing to an airmass of 1.0 .",
    "this is acceptable since all photometry is done differentially .",
    "the effects of water vapor absorption are not completely eliminated by the design of the mko - nir filters .",
    "@xcite computed the extinction for the mko - nir filters as a function of telluric precipitable water .",
    "the atmospheric extinction coefficients is shown in table 2 for 2 mm of precipitable water . for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 these values are smaller than for those given by @xcite who employed older filters with wider passbands .",
    "see also the ukirt web site , http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/ukirt/astronomy/ utils / exts.html ) .",
    "for @xmath34 and @xmath35 the calculated extinction coefficients are identical to that observed within the errors .",
    "computations of the extrapolation to zero airmass as a function of water vapor from 1 to 5 mm precipitable water suggests the variations of the magnitude at zero airmass is in the range of 0.0030.012 mag for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath34 , and in the range of 0.096 - 0.123 for @xmath35 for the mko - nir filters @xcite . for nearly all work the uncertainties in the exo - atmospheric magnitudes for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath34 are acceptable . since the uncertainties at @xmath35 are larger , care is needed if accurate exo - atmospheric magnitudes are needed .",
    "a complication arises for very cool stars that have deep water and other strong molecular absorption bands . in this case",
    ", there will be a color term in the extinction curve .",
    "good discussions on measuring the color term are given by @xcite and @xcite , and the formal derivation of the color term in photometry is given by @xcite .",
    "as this color term is rarely measured , high - precision photometry of cool objects is subject to uncertainties arising from neglecting it .",
    "the importance of this color term is that when one extrapolates the observations to zero airmass ( i.e. , above the atmosphere ) , the result should be identical to observations done completely in the absence of an atmosphere .",
    "@xcite have proposed relatively narrowband filters that minimize color transformations between observatories and instruments .",
    "the extrapolation to zero airmass for these filters is approximately linear .",
    "this filter set is important for observations where one wants to determine the absolute calibration to above the atmosphere .",
    "the absolute calibration work by @xcite and @xcite used narrowband filters exactly for this reason .",
    "the papers by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite give a set of standard stars measured in the mko - nir filter set .",
    "the magnitudes of these standard stars were largely based on the system established by @xcite .",
    "although the zero point of the system was not determined explicitly , it should be close to that of elias , namely that the colors of vega are 0.0 mag ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we discuss in this section an approach to better establish the photometric zero point of the mko - nir standards relative to a set of a0v stars .    to set the zero point of the mko - nir photometric system , one could observe a number of a0v stars and either define sirius to have zero colors as suggested by @xcite and @xcite or adopt an average of a0v stars to have zero colors after removing the interstellar extinction .",
    "the latter method was used by @xcite when they defined the @xmath29 system .",
    "thus vega has a magnitude of + 0.03 mag in the johnson system , although @xcite recently determined @xmath39 mag . in the former method",
    ", sirius is proposed instead of vega because there is no definitive model atmosphere for vega and because sirius is accessible to the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "however sirius and vega are too bright to be observed with current instrumentation .",
    "@xcite have computed the colors of stars in all spectral classes using synthetic photometry ( see @xcite for a description of this technique ) . to set the zero point",
    ", they used the vega atmospheric model adopted by @xcite and assumed that the magnitude of vega is zero at all wavelegths .",
    "this approach has the advantage that corrections can be easily made for adoption of other magnitudes for vega or an improved atmospheric model for vega .",
    "@xcite used an inhomogeneous set of sources in the literature for the spectra of the m , l , and t dwarfs .",
    "there is currently a program underway at the irtf to generate a library of moderate resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra of a large number of stars with reliable spectral types spanning the entire range of known spectral types and luminosity classes .",
    "spectra for m , l , and t dwarfs , included as part of this irtf spectral library , have already been published @xcite and spectra for f  t stars are now available on the irtf web site http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/@xmath40spex/spexlibrary/ irtflibrary.html .",
    "we are undertaking a project to use these spectra to compute synthetic photometry of the stars in the library to significantly improve on the approach taken by @xcite .",
    "the advantages of using this spectral library are ( 1 ) it covers the spectral range 0.85.0 @xmath0 m , with resolutions of @xmath41 between 0.82.5  @xmath0 m , and @xmath42 between 2.55.0  @xmath0 m , and signal - to - noise ratios greater than 100 ; ( 2 ) all of the data were obtained with the same instrument ( spex , @xcite ) and reduced in a consistent manner with the same reduction package ( spextool , @xcite ) ; ( 3 ) all flux calibrations were achieved using a0v stars , with @xmath30 mag between 58 , as spectral standards @xcite ; and ( 4 ) most of the stars in the spectral library have 2mass magnitudes available .    because the irtf spectral library calibration relies on the model of vega adopted by @xcite and observations of a0v stars , scaled to their observed @xmath30 mag and corrected for any possible reddening as estimated from their @xmath32 colors ( see *",
    "* ) , the colors of the program stars as derived from synthetic photometry , should be quite accurate . to determine the systematic uncertainties",
    ", we plan to obtain photometry on a set of unreddened a0v stars with the mko - nir filters .",
    "the average color of these stars would be defined to be zero for all filter combinations .",
    "these stars would be then observed in a fashion similar to that used for the irtf spectral library and compared to the photometric results .",
    "previous comparisons between synthetic photometry and actual measurements indicate that the uncertainties in the colors are at the level of a few percent @xcite .",
    "infrared photometry is now a mature technique with photometric accuracy comparable to that obtained in the visible wavelength range .",
    "however , standardization has not yet been achieved .",
    "combining data from different observations is generally difficult due to the diverse filter sets ( often with similar labels ) and the numerous photometric systems now in use .",
    "we advocate the use of a single filter set , and the widespread use of the mko - nir filter set is helping to achieve this .",
    "we have summarized some aspects of infrared photometry for the novice to infrared photometry filter wavelength definitions , the flux density for zero magnitude , atmospheric extinction coefficients , and color corrections to above the atmosphere .",
