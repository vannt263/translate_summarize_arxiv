    "<S> _    the standard model ( sm ) has been tested at an impressive accuracy by recent collider experiments such as lep , slc , and tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> currently no serious conflict between the data and the sm is reported . however , the @xmath18 branching fraction has been higher than the sm value at a few standard deviation level . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath19 reported in summer 1995 @xcite was actually more than three standard deviations higher from the sm prediction and stimulated many theoretical and experimental efforts . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent measurements from slc ( @xmath20 @xcite , aleph @xmath21 @xcite , delphi @xmath22 @xcite , and opal @xmath23 @xcite , however , are consistent with the sm ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 gev ) , and as a result , the 1996 world average value combining all the old and new data has come closer to the sm prediction @xmath26 @xcite . since older and newer measurements have different systematics , it is not clear at this stage whether it is appropriate to discard older measurements from the world average . in fact , delphi suggested to combine their older and newer measurements , while aleph did not </S>",
    "<S> . the central value may further evolve as newer methods are developed and the experimental inputs are updated . in view of this situation , </S>",
    "<S> it is premature to judge what the final outcome would be . therefore , it is useful to investigate the consequence of various models on @xmath27 in the light of other experimental constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that the 1996 @xmath27 value is actually more favored by various new physics scenarios than the 1995 one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 1995 average was hard to be explained by one - loop corrections to the @xmath28 vertex due to new particles . </S>",
    "<S> the 1996 average , on the other hand , is within the variation of @xmath27 values predicted in the many new physics scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> this arises a renewed interest to check the consistency of various scenarios of high @xmath27 with other existing experimental constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> currently there are two popular models which may lead to @xmath27 values higher than that in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> one is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the small @xmath29 region , where the loop of a scalar top ( mostly right - handed one ) and a chargino ( mostly higgsino - like one ) can enhance @xmath27 which attracted many discussions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other is the loop of pseudo - scalar and scalar higgs bosons in two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which can also enhance @xmath27 if @xmath29 is large . </S>",
    "<S> the first scenario is now strongly constrained by recent limits on the chargino mass from lep - ii and the scalar top mass from d0 . </S>",
    "<S> still , one can accommodate a correction to @xmath0 as large as @xmath30 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that the latter scenario is in a conflict with the lack of an enhancement in the four-@xmath31 final states from @xmath10 decay @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current experimental limit on four-@xmath31 or @xmath32 final state @xcite is , however , not as stringent as estimated in @xcite , and there still remains a possibility that this scenario may enhance the @xmath27 at a desirable level . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this letter to investigate whether this scenario is consistent with other existing constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> the 2hdm has several motivations . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it is the simplest extension of the minimal standard model which has to be confronted by experiments . </S>",
    "<S> second , the electroweak baryogenesis requires an extension of the minimal standard model to incorporate a cp - violation in the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> the 2hdm can naturally have cp - violating phases in its potential , and it is argued that it can create the value of cosmic baryon asymmetry as required by nucleosynthesis ( for a review , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> third , the 2hdm may be a part of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> a general 2hdm has a potential problem of flavor - changing neutral currents , which can be naturally avoided by either of the following two ways . </S>",
    "<S> the type - i 2hdm lets only one of the higgs doublets couple to quarks and leptons and hence the coupling matrix of the higgs bosons can be simultaneously diagonalized as the mass matrix of quarks . </S>",
    "<S> there is no flavor - changing vertex of the higgs bosons . in this case , however , a large @xmath29 does not enhance the higgs coupling to the @xmath31-quark , and hence there is no interesting large contribution to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the type - ii 2hdm lets one of the higgs bosons couple to the up - quarks while the other to the down - quarks and a large @xmath29 can enhance the coupling to the @xmath31-quark . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , either one of them can couple to the leptons . </S>",
    "<S> it is probably natural , however , to assume that the one which couples to the down - quarks also couples to the leptons because they share the same weak isospin @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed the case , for instance , in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> then it is a natural question to ask whether a large @xmath29 affects the phenomenology of the lepton sector .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a strong correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath0 in the type - ii 2hdm . from the observed lepton universality in @xmath10 decay </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath0 can not deviate from the sm prediction by more than @xmath35 at 95% confidence level almost independently from @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this upper bound is in a conflict with the current central value of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the consequence of the 2hdm on the @xmath28 and @xmath36 vertices was studied already some time ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was concluded that the correction to @xmath36 vertex was too small to be observed compared to its size to @xmath28 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that two important changes should be made to this conclusion , however . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the improved accuracy in the experimental test of the lepton universality in @xmath10 decay , and the second is the running effect of the @xmath31-quark yukawa coupling between @xmath37 and @xmath38 which was not taken into account </S>",
    "<S> . a combination of a high accuracy in @xmath39 ( defined below ) and the running effect of @xmath40 can make the @xmath36 vertex much more sensitive than previously thought .    the lepton universality in @xmath10 decay is now tested at an extremely high accuracy . for later discussion , we parameterize the possible violation of the lepton universality by the following double ratio , @xmath41 here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath42 refers to either @xmath43 or @xmath44 assuming the universality among them , and the subscript sm to the standard model values . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of using @xmath45 is that many uncertainties cancel in the double ratio . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the uncertainties in the luminosity measurement and overall width measurement nearly cancel between @xmath46 and @xmath42 . theoretically , the top quark and higgs boson masses enter the predictions of partial widths through oblique corrections , but they cancel in the ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the sm values @xmath47 is determined mostly by the kinematic factor @xmath48 to a very good approximation because of the axial - coupling dominance in lepton couplings to the @xmath10 boson . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is little theoretical ambiguity in the predicted ratio in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> we hence find that @xmath45 is the most useful quantity for our purpose .    </S>",
    "<S> we derived the experimental value of @xmath45 from the @xmath10 line shape and lepton forward - backward asymmetries reported by the lep electroweak working group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they quote measured values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and their errors and correlation including new data from the 1995 energy scan . here , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the lepton universality for the first two generations , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and using @xmath61 fit to the seven remaining parameters , we determine the ratio @xmath62 the correlations among the seven parameters are fully taken into account . normalizing it by the ratio in the standard model , we obtain @xmath63 the 95% confidence level upper bound is @xmath64 . note that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite quotes a somewhat weaker constraint on the ratio of electron and @xmath46 couplings @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which correspond to @xmath67 error in @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ratios do not assume @xmath43-@xmath44 universality and they tried to separate axial and vector couplings which are not necessary for our purpose .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we include the effect of the running of @xmath31-quark yukawa coupling between @xmath37 and @xmath38 scales which was not taken into account in the previous analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take the following procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we first take the value of @xmath68@xmath69  gev in the @xmath4 scheme as summarized by the particle data group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to run the @xmath4 mass from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , we employ the renormalization group equation at two - loop level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical values of @xmath8 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mb ] . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded region is the world average @xmath70 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic width which is consistent with our spirit to allow @xmath27 to deviate from the sm prediction . </S>",
    "<S> ] in this letter we take center values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which correspond to @xmath73gev . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss later how the results change for different choices of @xmath71 and @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.5    we do not go into the discussion of the mssm higgs sector in our letter . </S>",
    "<S> this is partly to simplify the analysis without many additional parameters in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> it is however mainly because a large contribution to @xmath0 requires a large @xmath29 with a light higgs multiplets , which in turn implies a light charged higgs boson in the context of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> such a light charged higgs boson is already strongly constrained by the cleo measurement of the @xmath75 rate . </S>",
    "<S> one needs to rely on a cancelation between the charged higgs diagram ( which always adds up with the standard model contribution ) and the chargino loop which is also uncomfortably large . </S>",
    "<S> a light charged higgs boson is further constrained also by @xmath76 @xcite and @xmath77 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though there are viable regions in the parameter space @xcite , we do not pursue this direction further in this letter . while keeping @xmath27 large in a limited region of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting question whether such a cancelation is possible within the parameter space which sufficiently suppresses @xmath78 @xcite . ]    on the other hand , a general type - ii 2hdm allows a heavy charged higgs boson naturally consistent with the @xmath78 constraint , while having neutral higgs bosons as light as 50  gev @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak @xmath79-parameter restricts the mass splitting among the higgs bosons . for light @xmath80 and @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the upper bound on the charged higgs boson mass to be @xmath82  gev at 95% cl using the precision electroweak data given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the 2hdm with light @xmath80 and @xmath81 is either only marginally consistent with these constraints , or requires some new physics to be consistent with the electroweak precision data . </S>",
    "<S> we simply assume in this letter that such new physics enters only oblique corrections and does not modify @xmath83 or @xmath84 vertices . </S>",
    "<S> we thank s.kanemura for discussions on this point . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological viability of such a light higgs spectrum was recently also stressed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the parameter range of our interest in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the 2hdm contains five physical higgs bosons , two neutral cp even states @xmath85 and @xmath86 , one cp odd state @xmath87 , and two charged states @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we decompose two higgs doublets as @xmath90 the mass eigenstates of the higgs bosons are related to the weak eigenstates as follows : @xmath91 for lighter ( @xmath85 ) and heavier ( @xmath86 ) neutral cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath92 for the neutral cp - odd higgs boson , and @xmath93 for the charged higgs boson . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , we have the following free parameters : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> below , we take the limit of the heavy charged higgs boson which is possible in the general 2hdm parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we do so because the loop of the charged higgs boson and the top quark reduces @xmath27 and hence the positive contribution to @xmath27 is maximized in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the constraint from @xmath78 is naturally avoided in this limit as well .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.5    we evaluated the diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagrams ] , and found an agreement with previous calculations @xcite .- quark and @xmath46-lepton masses in loop diagrams while we keep their yukawa coupling constants finite . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex diagrams @xmath100 are proportional to @xmath101 but lack the @xmath102 enhancement . for large values of @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in , this contribution is subdominant and the omission of @xmath40 in the diagram is justified . the diagrams with nambu  </S>",
    "<S> goldstone bosons in the @xmath103 gauge are the same as in the sm and hence are not enhanced for large @xmath29 . ] </S>",
    "<S> all the loop factors are common for @xmath31 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the only differences are in the size of yukawa coupling @xmath104 and the couplings to the @xmath10 boson , @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 . by parameterizing the loop factors from the first ( second ) diagram as @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , </S>",

    "<S> hence the first term in the bracket is simply @xmath112 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the second term is @xmath113 for @xmath46 and @xmath114 for @xmath31 , and hence is less important for @xmath31 . in order to simplify the discussion we take @xmath115 where the @xmath86 is almost decoupled from leptons and down - quarks . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 has the enhanced yukawa coupling for large @xmath29 while @xmath86 is the sm higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath95 is irrelevant to the following discussion . and @xmath39 . ] </S>",
    "<S> one can easily generalize the analysis for @xmath116 , but the strong correlation remains the same and hence the final conclusion as well . </S>",
