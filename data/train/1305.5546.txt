    "their energy is therefore pinned to zero .",
    "consequently , majoranas can only be destroyed by pairing with another and hybridizing into a dirac fermion .",
    "we focus on chiral @xmath0 superconductors . in continuum models with nonzero chern numbers ,",
    "zero - energy majoranas develop around defects , such as vortices.@xcite when the vortices are well - separated , the associated majoranas are protected from local perturbations , which could be useful in quantum computers .",
    "majoranas are also expected in lattice models of chiral superconductors ; if the gap is of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the range of the interaction , it reduces to @xmath7 in the continuum limit .",
    "in contrast to the continuum case where the range of the interaction , @xmath6 , simply rescales the gap function , the range plays a more interesting role on the lattice .",
    "previous work@xcite suggested that the inclusion of longer - ranged interactions leads to novel phases .",
    "these longer - ranged interactions in general give rise to larger chern numbers in a way that can be most easily understood when all interactions are of the same range . when all interactions are of the same range , a number of noninteracting sublattices , @xmath8 , form .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ 2nn - lattice ] , two sublattices form when only next - nearest neighbor terms are present . as separate systems",
    ", each sublattice has its own chern number , either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the chern number for the whole system is either @xmath9 or @xmath8 .    to explore the more complicated case of interactions of different ranges",
    ", we study a square lattice with a combination of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping ( respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and @xmath0 pairing ( respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) terms . the system is kept at chemical potential @xmath15 . both the hopping and pairing terms",

    "our analysis of the system shows that the phase diagram depends only on _ three _ ratios of parameters : @xmath16 and the scaled hopping terms @xmath17 , @xmath18 . for fixed values of @xmath19 , all phase transitions are lines in the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane .",
    "there are four such lines , three of which are independent of @xmath19 .",
    "when a system is tuned to one of these phase transition lines , the gap in the system collapses because a zero of @xmath20 is crossing the fermi surface .",
    "the lines constitute the phase diagram for a given value of @xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] .",
    "when @xmath21 , the phase transition lines remain fixed , and @xmath20 only has zeros at the four high - symmetry points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 because the nnn pairing terms are not strong enough to introduce any zeros into @xmath20 .",
    "the topology of the system is unaffected by the weak nnn pairing . when @xmath26 , four additional zeros are introduced into @xmath20 , permitting larger chern numbers .",
    "an analytical calculation finds all chern numbers possible with nn and nnn terms ; they range from @xmath1 to @xmath27 .",
    "chern number @xmath28 , while conceivably possible with nnn pairing terms , can not be obtained with just nnn hopping terms for the same reason that chern number @xmath3 can not be obtained with just nn pairing and hopping terms .",
    "however , the system does take on chern number @xmath2 , which is surprising because purely nnn interactions yield chern number @xmath3 .",
    "the numerical aspect of the present work characterizes the response of the model system to defects in different phases .",
    "in particular , we focus on characterizing the low - energy response , i.e. , identifying the the fundamental excitations of the system . for the numerics ,",
    "we include three kinds of position - dependent terms into the hamiltonian : edges , on - site disorder , and magnetic fields in an extreme type - ii limit with vortices in the superconducting order parameter .",
    "edges are introduced by adding terms of the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is very large past the edge , confining the states in the low energy spectrum . on - site disorder",
    "is added in a similar manner : @xmath30 takes on a value of @xmath31 with probability @xmath32 and @xmath33 with the same probability , and @xmath9 otherwise . for the magnetic field , we assume a very long magnetic screening length so that the magnetic field is constant , consistent with the sample being two dimensional . however , the superconducting coherence length @xmath34 is finite , and vortices appear in the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the output of numerical simulations are the energies and wavefunctions of the quasiparticles of the hamiltonian .",
    "the edge modes and vortex core modes are perfectly distinct in the ideal limit of infinite separation . in the realistic case of finite separation , the modes hybridize .",
    "the vortex core modes interact with each other in a similar way .",
    "the energies of the lowest vortex core modes exhibit exponentially damped oscillations as the vortices are separated , an effect theoretically predicted@xcite and numerically observed@xcite in related systems .",
    "the edges hybridize with vortices over longer length scale than the and vortices hybridize with each other .",
    "the hybridization effects also depend on the bulk parameters of the system , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , as these parameters are tuned to the phase transitions , the edge - vortex length scale diverges .",
    "such tuning is explored in a system with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( energy is given in terms of the nnn hopping strength , @xmath12 ) by adjusting the chemical potential @xmath15 , i.e. by moving along the path shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] , which crosses several phase transitions .",
    "while in the chern number @xmath2 portion of the phase diagram , we find that the spatial period of vortex - vortex oscillation increase linearly with the chemical potential : @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath15 takes on values putting the system too close to the phase transition , edge - vortex hybridization destroys the vortex - vortex oscillatory behavior .",
    "another issue addressed in the numerical simulation is the number of low - energy modes created around defects . when only nnn interactions are present , one majorana mode per vortex per sublattice forms .",
    "when the nn terms are turned on , the majoranas may hybridize down to zero or one residual zero - energy mode , for even and odd chern number , respectively@xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is some degree of protection of the additional defect mode for the chern number @xmath3 phase .",
    "the numerical simulation reveals two , apparently disorder resistant , zero energy , vortex core modes .",
    "the chern number @xmath2 phase , however , enjoys no such additional modes : only one low - energy vortex - core mode is observed in the numerical simulations .",

    ", we discuss the numerical attack on the system , with defects present , and the resulting conclusions .",
