    "subsequently , we `` equilibrate '' the system until each particle has moved on average more than several times its own diameter , and the system has reached a steady state .",

    "we clearly observe that the dynamics slows down with orders of magnitude upon increasing the packing fraction for both passive and active systems .",
    "in addition , we find that the structural relaxation time of both passive and active systems can be fitted with the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) law , @xmath19 and the mode coupling theory ( mct ) prediction , @xmath20 @xcite . for a passive hard - sphere system , we find in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite that the structural relaxation @xmath15 can be described by an algebraic mct divergence at a packing fraction @xmath21 , and an exponential vft divergence at @xmath22 . for active hard spheres",
    ", we observe that @xmath15 decreases by orders of magnitude upon increasing the self - propulsion @xmath6 at fixed @xmath17 .",
    "however , for sufficiently high densities the dynamics slows down dramatically and the structural relaxation time is again well - described by the mct and vft predictions as shown in fig .",
    "we thus find that the dynamical relaxation behavior of active hard spheres is very similar to that of passive hard spheres , as our results show clear evidence for dynamical arrest and a diverging structural relaxation time even for systems that are far out - of - equilibrium at very high activity .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we present the resulting critical packing fractions @xmath23 and @xmath24 as obtained from the vft and mct fits , respectively , as well as the critical exponent @xmath25 and prefactor @xmath26 .",
    "we find that @xmath24 as obtained from the mct fits increases monotonically with self - propulsion @xmath6 . for passive hard spheres",
    ", we find an mct critical exponent @xmath27 , which agrees with previous reported values of @xmath28 $ ] @xcite .",
    "in addition , we note that the critical exponent @xmath25 decreases slightly with increasing @xmath6 , but we also mention here that @xmath25 is extremely sensitive to the precise @xmath17-range that is used in the mct fitting as also noted in refs .",
    "@xcite . similarly , by fitting the structural relaxation time @xmath29 with the vft prediction , we find that @xmath30 also increases monotonically with self - propulsion @xmath6 , but less pronounced than @xmath24 .",
    "we also note that @xmath23 reaches a constant value @xmath31 within our statistical accuracy for @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows @xmath23 and @xmath24 as a function of the inverse activity @xmath33 .",
    "we find that the packing fraction range @xmath34 for which the dynamical relaxation is characterized by an exponential vft divergence decreases with decreasing @xmath33 , but remains finite even in the limit of infinite activity , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "this also suggests that even with infinitely strong random self - propulsions , during the process of producing rcp , the system yet undergoes an mct glass transition , in which the structural relaxation time diverges with a power law , and the obtained rcp of hard spheres still depends on the speed of compression .",
    "we also observe that the prefactor @xmath26 as determined from the vft fits decreases with activity @xmath6 , which corresponds to a stronger dependence of @xmath29 with packing fraction @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath29 allows us to classify the various glasses in terms of their `` fragility '' .",
    "the concept of `` fragility '' was originally introduced for molecular glasses to describe the sensitivity of @xmath29 to changes in temperature : fragile glasses show a strong temperature - dependence of @xmath29 , whereas strong glass - formers correspond to a weak sensitivity to temperature .",
    "the analogy between volume - dependent fragility in colloidal glasses and the temperature - dependent fragility in molecular glasses , where @xmath36 is exchanged with @xmath37 , has been demonstrated recently in experiments on deformable colloidal particles , where softer and more deformable particles lead to stronger glass behavior compared to hard particles @xcite .",
    "we thus find from our vft fits that @xmath29 depends stronger on packing fraction @xmath17 upon increasing @xmath6 as the prefactor @xmath26 decreases , which corresponds to more fragile glass behavior .",
    "the fragility is related to the structural relaxation in glasses , which can be described by activated processes like cage - breaking or barrier hopping in a complex energy landscape that reflects the possible glass configurations . upon increasing packing fraction @xmath17 ,",
    "the barriers between local minima in the energy landscape that correspond to different glass configurations increase and the system gets kinetically trapped in a local minimum at short times , and jumps only to other minima on a longer time scale due to activated dynamics . assuming that the relaxation time is determined by the barrier height of the activated process",
    ", one can determine the effective activation energy ( or entropic barrier height ) @xmath38 from the vft fits using @xmath39 .",
    "in the case of passive hard spheres , we find that @xmath40 at @xmath41 , which agrees well with the theoretical predictions of ref .",
    "however , the entropic barrier @xmath38 for passive hard spheres as obtained from the vft fits increases rapidly with @xmath17 , and reaches a value of @xmath42 at @xmath43 , which is much higher than the theoretically predicted barrier height of @xmath44 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath45 as obtained from the experimental observations and analysis of the structural rearrangements in colloidal glasses under shear @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the sharp increase in relaxation time @xmath29 and barrier height @xmath38 with increasing packing fraction @xmath17 is that a larger cooperativity of the particles is required in order to cross the barrier . for self - propelled spheres , we find that the effective activation energy @xmath38 at @xmath46 decreases to only a few @xmath47 for self - propulsions @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the particles can easily escape out of their cages due to the activated dynamics of the self - propulsions , which is consistent with the fact that @xmath46 is below the mct critical packing fraction @xmath24 .    for active hard spheres ,",
    "we observe that the relaxation time decreases by orders of magnitude as it becomes much easier for self - propelling motorized hard spheres to cross the barriers and to explore different glass configurations than for passive spheres . to better understand the effect of self - propulsion on the dynamics of hard - sphere glasses , we plot the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath49 for a system of active hard spheres with varying self - propulsions @xmath6 at @xmath50 in fig .  [ fig3]a .",
    "we observe that @xmath49 reaches a cage - trapping plateau and remains stuck in an amorphous configuration in the case of passive hard spheres , whereas for active spheres @xmath49 decays to zero within our simulations , and the relaxation time decreases significantly with self - propulsion .",
    "the common picture of glassy dynamics and barrier crossings is that a particle rattles for a long time inside a cage that is formed by its neighbours and then suddenly breaks out of its cage . to investigate whether or not the barrier crossing corresponds to an abrupt cage - breaking event and",
    "how localized these events are , we measure the four - point dynamic susceptibility , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the fluctuating part of @xmath49 , as shown in fig .  [ fig3]a .",
    "as expected , @xmath53 increases initially in time and shows a peak on a time scale that coincides with the structural relaxation time @xmath15 before it decays at longer times .",
    "the height of the peak of @xmath53 is related to the average number of particles that are dynamically correlated in the structural relaxation process @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows that the peak height of @xmath53 is @xmath54 for @xmath55 , providing support that there is almost no collective motion involved in the structural relaxation , which is to be expected as @xmath56 is far below the mct critical packing fraction @xmath24 at @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , we find clearly that the peak height increases upon decreasing the self - propulsion towards @xmath57 and thus also decreasing mct critical packing fraction @xmath24 .",
    "we note however that we were not able to determine the peak height at @xmath57 as the relaxation time exceeds our simulation time .",
    "we thus find that even for self - propelled hard spheres the structural relaxation becomes more cooperative for packing fractions close to the mct glass transition , i.e. , @xmath58 .    to corroborate our finding on the cooperative nature of the structural relaxation for self - propelled spheres , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the distribution of displacements in a system of active hard spheres at @xmath50 measured over a time window that spans the structural relaxation time @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] clearly shows that for @xmath59 the fast moving particles , i.e. , particles with displacements larger than @xmath60 , are spatially correlated , which is to be expected as the system is close to the mct glass transition .",
    "we wish to mention here that collective motion was also observed in recent simulations on a 2-dimensional active hard - disk system  @xcite . for larger self - propulsions ,",
    "i.e. @xmath61 , the motion of the particles is less correlated as the system is well below @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the dynamics becomes more fluid - like and the dynamic heterogeneities disappear in a system of active hard spheres with @xmath61 and @xmath56 .",
    "we also study the effect of self - propulsion on the cage dynamics . to this end",
    ", we measure the mean square displacement @xmath62 in a system of passive hard spheres at @xmath56 . the mean square displacement as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c shows a clear plateau at long time scales as the particles are kinetically trapped within the cages that are formed by their neighbours . to illustrate the cage effect , we present snapshots of a typical dynamical trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig3]f - g , where we highlight the particles that form the cage .",
    "we clearly observe that the cage remains intact on at least a time scale of @xmath63 with @xmath64 the mean short - time diffusion coefficient . for comparison",
    ", we also plot @xmath62 for a system of active hard spheres with @xmath65 , which shows diffusive behavior at short times , and subdiffusive behavior at intermediate time scales but without a clear cage - trapping plateau . at long time scales",
    ", @xmath62 grows linearly with time and the particles become diffusive again with a long time diffusion coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "the snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d - e show that the cage has disappeared completely within a time scale of @xmath63 , which explains the absence of any cage effect in @xmath62 ( see supplementary movie 1 and 2 ) .    finally , we investigated if a particle can break out of its cage by its own self - propulsion .",
    "we performed a simulation of a single active particle with activity @xmath67 in a system of @xmath2 hard spheres at @xmath56 , and measured @xmath62 for both active and passive spheres .",
    "we clearly find that the passive spheres are trapped within their cages as @xmath68 , whereas the single active hard sphere can jump out of its cage , although it remains a rare event .",
    "if we increase the fraction of active spheres to @xmath69 , we find that the mobility of both the passive and active spheres increases significantly resulting in long - time diffusion coefficients @xmath66 and 0.0625 for the passive and active particles , respectively . we thus conclude that a motorized particle can occasionally break out of its cage by its own self - propelling force , but there is also a collective effect , because the mobility is even more enhanced upon increasing the fraction of active spheres .    to shed light on the enhanced mobility with increased activity , we investigate the structure of the active hard - sphere system as a function of self - propulsion @xmath6 .",
    "we calculate the static structure factor @xmath70 at @xmath56 and present our results in fig .",
    "we clearly observe that the main peak of @xmath70 shifts to higher wave vector @xmath71 and becomes broader upon increasing the self - propulsion @xmath6 , which indicates that the average separation between neighboring particles becomes smaller , but the distribution of interparticle distances gets broader .",
    "we thus conclude that the structure of an equilibrium glass of passive hard spheres is different from a non - equilibrium active hard - sphere system at the same packing fraction .",
    "however , we also find that the difference in structure decreases upon increasing @xmath17 , and we speculate that the structure becomes similar in the limit of rcp as the system becomes fully jammed .",
    "the observed structural changes can be explained by the fact that particles are pushed closer together due to the self - propulsion , thereby creating more `` free volume '' for other particles , which can then break out of their cages and the glass state can melt into a non - equilibrium fluid phase .",
    "a similar melting of hard - sphere glasses was also observed in systems , where the addition of depletants instead of self - propulsions leads to a clustering of the particles and a destruction of the cages  @xcite .",
    "a similar picture emerged from a detailed simulation study on a 2-dimensional system of active hard disks , where it was found that active particles transiently stick to the neighbours found in the direction of their self - propulsion until the direction of the motion is changed due to brownian rotation  @xcite .      in this work",
    ", we used a rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath72 according to the stokes - einstein relation . to study the effect of particle rotations on the dynamics of the system , we perform edbd simulations for a system of active hard spheres with @xmath59 and rotational diffusion coefficients @xmath73 varying from 0.3 to 300 @xmath74 .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "we observe clearly that the structural relaxation time increases monotonically with packing fraction , and that the dynamics is well - described by the vft and mct predictions for all values of @xmath73 that we studied .",
    "note that @xmath75 corresponds to the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "in addition , we find that upon increasing the rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath73 , the relaxation dynamics slows down , the critical mct and vft packing fractions @xmath24 and @xmath23 decrease , and the fragility index @xmath26 increases .",
    "more specifically , we find that the relaxation dynamics of active hard spheres approaches that of passive brownian hard spheres in the limit of @xmath76 as the orientations of the self - propelling force at any time @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) become uncorrelated thereby recovering the white noise in brownian motion .",
    "in conclusion , we performed extensive edbd simulations of systems of self - propelled motorized hard spheres , and investigated the dynamical behavior of systems that are far out of equilibrium .",
    "we find that the relaxation dynamics can be sped up by orders of magnitude upon increasing the self - propulsion of the particles .",
    "this result provides an important step forward towards a better understanding of dense packings as it allows us to investigate sphere packings with fluid - like dynamics at densities close to random close packing without crossing a glass transition .",
    "for instance , the structural relaxation time of active hard spheres with a self - propulsion @xmath67 at a packing fraction as high as @xmath80 is similar to that of a passive hard - sphere system at @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , we show that the non - equilibrium mct glass transition in a system of active hard spheres is pushed from @xmath82 volume fraction in the case of passive hard spheres to packing fractions close to rcp upon increasing the self - propulsion .",
    "the non - equilibrium glass phase shows characteristics like dynamical arrest , cooperative motion , and a diverging structural relaxation time that are reminiscent of the equilibrium glass transition .",
    "thus , our findings strongly support recent theoretical predictions on the existence of a non - equilibrium glass transition in active systems  @xcite . consequently ,",
    "as the packing fraction at which the system falls out of equilibrium depends on self - propulsion , and the resulting glass phase can only be compressed further to its corresponding jammed state at infinite pressure , we expect to find a range of jamming densities that depends on activity .",
    "in addition , our structure factor data show that the structure of the equilibrium glass phase of passive hard spheres is different from that of active hard spheres , but we expect that the structure becomes similar in the limit of random close packing .",
    "additionally , we show that the effect of a self - propulsion is more pronounced for slower rotational diffusion , while the dynamics of active hard spheres becomes brownian in the limit of an infinitely large rotational diffusion coefficient .",
    "our study can also be extended to random packings of arbitrarily shaped particles , which will provide new insights in the concept of rcp as well as the glass transition of these systems .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate if active particles can be used to unjam systems that are kinetically trapped in a glass phase in order to promote the formation of the thermodynamically stable phase .",
    "we hope that our findings inspire future experimental investigations on glassy dynamics of dense suspensions of active particles or of colloidal glasses that only contain a small amount of active particles .",
    "we wish to note here that most experimental studies so far have only been focussed on dilute instead of concentrated suspensions , and that most experimental systems correspond to much lower activities @xmath83 @xcite than studied here , but the light - activated colloids @xcite , the catalytic janus particles @xcite , and the particles with a artificial magnetic flagella @xcite are capable of producing self - propulsions as high as @xmath84 , 50 , 80 , respectively , which should have a profound effect on the relaxation dynamics in concentrated systems .",
    "we perform event - driven brownian dynamics simulations  @xcite of a system of self - propelled hard spheres . to avoid crystallization",
    "we study a suspension of @xmath2 hard spheres with a gaussian size polydispersity of @xmath3 and a mean diameter of @xmath4 . even though the particles are driven and energy is continuously supplied to the system , the temperature @xmath36 is kept fixed as the solvent acts as a heat bath .",
    "the overdamped motion of particle @xmath5 with position @xmath85 and orientation @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where the potential energy @xmath88 is the sum of excluded - volume interactions between all hard spheres , and @xmath89 is the short - time self diffusion coefficient of particle @xmath5 .",
    "a stochastic force with zero mean , @xmath90 , describes the collisions with the solvent molecules , and satisfies @xmath91 with @xmath92 the identity matrix .",
    "in addition , the self - propulsion of particle @xmath5 is described by a constant force @xmath6 in the direction @xmath7 at time @xmath77 .",
