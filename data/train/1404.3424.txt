    "the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) paradigm has been very successful in explaining the structure formation on large scales",
    ". one of its predictions is a universal density profile for the dark matter halos .",
    "navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 , nfw ) suggested a simple formula to describe these density profiles , which presents a divergent inner profile ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "another prediction of the @xmath4cdm model is the number of subhalos per unit mass around the host galaxy .",
    "both predictions have been challenged on scales of dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact , a significant fraction of the rotation curves of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies and dwarf irregular galaxies are better fitted using dark halos with a density core ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the case for cores in milky way ( mw ) satellites is still debated .",
    "for instance , @xcite mentioned that the data of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal are consistent when an nfw dark matter halo is assumed .",
    "moreover , for dwarf galaxies in the field or andromeda the information is about the dark matter mass and not the density profiles , so a direct determination of the slope in the density profile is not possible . regarding the prediction in the number of subhalos , it turns out that the standard cdm model overpredicts the number of dwarf satellite galaxies in the mw and m31 .",
    "this disagreement is usually referred to as the `` missing satellite problem '' @xcite .",
    "although the detection of ultra faint galaxies within the mw halo has reduced the missing satellite problem ( e.g. simon & geha 2007 ) , a recent study by @xcite of the distribution of satellites around the mw and m31 suggests they have specific alignments forming planes that are not found in current cdm simulations . independently of this potential issue , the central densities of mw dsph galaxies are required to be significantly lower than the densities of the largest subhalos found in collisionless dm simulations to agree with current data@xcite . indeed , cdm simulations of the aquarius project @xcite suggest that the mw size halos should inhabit at least eight subhalos with maximum circular velocities exceeding @xmath7 km s@xmath8 , while observations indicate that only three satellite galaxies of the mw possess halos with maximum circular velocities @xmath9 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this discrepancy is known as the  too big to fail  problem .",
    "it has been argued that the physics of baryons must be included in order to make a fair interpretation of observations on scales of mw subhalos .",
    "for instance , mass outflows given by supernova explosions could transform a cusp into a core in some field dsph galaxies at the present time .",
    "the missing satellite discrepancy may be explained as a consequence of gas reionization that quenched the star formation in halos with maximum circular velocity less than @xmath10 km s@xmath8 , leaving hundreds of small mass halos without stars @xcite . in principle",
    "using gravitational lensing techniques could confirm the existence of these halos .",
    "however , there is still no consensus on whether mass outflows and reionization can explain the observed properties of the mw satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "additionally , it seems there could be a numerical code dependence when interpreting the results obtained from simulations @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was noted that cdm predicts massive subhalos with central densities higher than those found in satellite galaxies , meaning that there are dm subhalos that are massive but host no satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "all these problems might be related and share a common solution .",
    "the way they are correlated usually depends on the dark model paradigm @xcite , or gravity model @xcite , but a general fact is that solving one of these issues provides clues to the solution for the other issues .",
    "it it worth mentioning that although supernovae explosions seem to play a crucial role in forming cores in field dwarf galaxies and more massive systems where the gas is recycled to continue the star formation @xcite , it is unclear that the same feedback implementation works in satellite galaxies where the gas content is negligible and their stellar populations are mostly dominated by old stars . in this sense ,",
    "dark matter models where the core formation is through dm properties and not by the specifics of astrophysical processes are still viable alternative solutions .",
    "one of these alternative models is the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) model .",
    "the idea was first considered by @xcite and independently introduced by @xcite . in the sfdm model",
    "the main hypothesis is that the dark matter is a self - interacting real scalar field of a small mass ( @xmath11 ev / c@xmath12 ) that condensates forming bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) `` drops '' @xcite .",
    "we interpret these bec drops as the halos of galaxies @xcite such that the dm wave properties and the heisenberg uncertainty principle stop the dm phase - space density from growing indefinitely .",
    "these properties automatically avoid the divergent density ( cuspy ) profiles in dm halos and reduce the number of small satellites due to the mass cut - off in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "for this typical mass , it follows that the critical temperature of condensation of the scalar field is t@xmath13tev , thus , bec drops can be formed very early in the universe .",
    "there have also been numerous studies that analyzed the behavior of the scalar field at large scales @xcite , concluding that it reproduces the successes of the cdm model at those scales .    one straightforward and universal prediction of the wave properties of this model is that dm halos have core profiles since their initial formation @xcite . if halo distributions are flat from the beginning , then strong feedback blowouts are not required to produce low density distributions in dm - dominated systems .",
    "some other consequences of this particular feature have been explored in different contexts ; to fit rotation curves in lsb and dwarf galaxies @xcite , and to make strong lensing analyses @xcite .",
    "all these successes of the model have motivated us to test the model further in order to know if it can be regarded as a serious dm candidate in the universe ; conducting these tests is necessary for models whose dm properties are quite different from those of the standard classical particle description .",
    "thus , here we study the evolution of the stellar component of satellite dwarf galaxies embedded in sfdm halos orbiting within an sfdm mw - size host halo .",
    "our study provides constraints on both the final stellar distribution of dsphs and the survival of faint or ultra faint systems .",
    "we pursue this task by studying the conditions under which tidal disruption may occur in the sfdm model .",
    "previous studies have shown , using empirical core - like density profiles for dm halos , that tidal disruption can be more important than in halos with nfw profiles , especially if they pass close to the galactic disk ( see klimentowski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for collisionless simulations ) .",
    "however , until now there have not been studies addressing whether the tidal effects are strong enough to completely remove the stars in classical and ultra faint dwarf galaxies hosted by bec halos .",
    "the present work aims to investigate this issue through a series of simulations of a stellar component described by a plummer profile when it is embedded in a sfdm subhalo subject to the influence of a sfdm host halo with a disk component .",
    "we also conducted simulations without the disk to compare its effect on the stars .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 we explain the sfdm model and present the density profiles to be used in the simulations .",
    "section 3 describes the simulations , section 4 contains our results and discussions of the satellite galaxy evolution , and section 5 presents our conclusions .",
    "the dsph galaxies have low luminosities ( @xmath14l@xmath3 ) and very large dynamical mass - to - light ratios @xmath15 , which translate into a large amount of dm @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we detect the galaxies because of the stars and , in fact , using them as tracers of the potential gives us information about their potential well . here",
    "we use a plummer density profile @xcite for the stellar component of the dsph , where the mass density profile is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the stellar component , and @xmath18 is the plummer radius .",
    "one should note that @xmath18 can be related to the half - mass - radius @xmath19 through @xmath20 . in our simulations",
    ", we have set a half - mass - radius of @xmath21 pc , and a stellar mass of @xmath22  m@xmath3 , motivated by the typical values for draco , which is one of the classical dsph galaxies and also one of the least luminous satellites ( e.g. , see @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite , for draco ) .      in some of our simulations",
    "we include the potential of the mw s baryonic disk , which we model with a miyamoto - nagai potential @xcite    @xmath23    in the latter equation , @xmath24 stands for the mass of the disk , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for the horizontal and vertical scalelengths , respectively .",
    "we have set the mass of the disk to @xmath27  m@xmath3 , and the scalelengths to @xmath28  kpc , and @xmath29  kpc .            if dm is composed of scalar particles with masses @xmath30 1 ev / c@xmath12 , the galactic halos have very large occupation numbers and the field behaves as a classical field that obeys the klein - gordon equation . for sfdm halos ,",
    "the newtonian limit is enough to describe them . from the fits to the rotation curves of dm - dominated systems",
    ", it has been found that the sfdm halos of dm - dominated galaxies are well described with the ground state @xcite .",
    "however , the larger the galaxy the more important are the effects of the non - condensed states on the mass profile .",
    "the latter means that galaxies that have rc that remains flat even at large radii are better described by adding the excited state contributions @xcite .",
    "this suggests that excited states are relevant to describe mw size systems .",
    "their relevance in dwarfs is out of the scope of this work but see , for instance , @xcite . in this work",
    "we will then consider the base state to describe the dwarf dm halos .",
    "following the hypotheses mentioned above for the sf and using the temperature corrections to one loop for the scalar field , robles & matos ( 2013 ) found that after the phase transition that happens in the early universe , the field rolls down to a new minimum of the potential and reaches those values where it will remain .",
    "the structures will grow and eventually form the sf halos . assuming the field is at the minimum , the authors derive an analytical solution for a static spherical configuration that allows the presence of excited states .",
    "what they found is that for a sfdm halo in the state @xmath31 its density profile is given by @xmath32    in the latter equation , @xmath33 is the central mass density , @xmath34 , @xmath31 is a positive integer that identifies the minimum excited state needed to fit the data of a galaxy , @xmath35 is a scalelength that is determined from observations and its a free parameter ; fitting data for a given galaxy provides values for both parameters , the scale @xmath35 and the central density , and the same occurs using eq.([eq : core ] ) but for its own parameters .",
    "there is not observational evidence that determines how far the halo should extend , but we do expect that halos spread at least enough to cover up to the outermost measured data .",
    "it follows that if galaxies have stellar distributions mostly concentrated in the center with possibly some gas surrounding them , then @xmath35 would be larger than the radius where most of the stars are confined .",
    "based on the trend from the fits of works that use scalar field dark matter halos@xcite where the scale radius complies with the above condition , we may take the @xmath35 to be a truncation radius such that @xmath36 for @xmath37>@xmath35 and for all @xmath38 @xmath35 the density is given by eq.([eq : sfdm ] ) .",
    "we recall that scalar field configurations in excited states are characterized by nodes , thus , for a bounded configuration the ground state has no nodes and corresponds to @xmath39 , the first excited state has one node and it is associated with @xmath40 , the second has two nodes , and so on .",
    "we remark that from this interpretation , if we are dealing with a field configuration in the ground state corresponding to zero nodes , then eq.([eq : sfdm ] ) has no oscillatory behavior ; only those configurations in excited states have oscillations .    from equation ( [ eq : sfdm ] )",
    "we obtain the mass and rotation curve velocity profiles given by @xmath41 respectively .",
    "@xcite reported that mw dsphs that are within sfdm halos in the ground state are well described with truncation radii in the range @xmath42 0.5@xmath432 kpc , they mentioned that a common value larger than 5 kpc is disfavored by the dynamics of dsphs provided they are in sfdm halos where only the ground state is taken into account .",
    "@xcite extended this result to account for higher energy states of the scalar field in the associated sfdm halos of the mw dsphs and found that the the stellar distribution lies inside the region where the ground state of the sf is mostly confined ( @xmath44 0.5 -1.5 kpc ) , also , the presence of the first excited state does not substantially affect the innermost dark matter configuration but it does allow for the possibility of a larger truncation radius ( @xmath42 5 kpc ) , nevertheless current data in the dwarfs analyzed are insufficient to conclude the existence of other states in sfdm halos of mw dsphs and hence determining precisely the halo radius . for our generic analysis of a typical dwarf we will then consider a value of @xmath35 = 2 kpc consistent with the results suggested by the above independent analyses , additionally , notice that most of the stellar component resides inside 1 kpc in most dsphs , where the dark matter distribution is not substantially modified by the precise halo radius that is considered as shown in @xcite .",
    "for the parameters of the dwarf dm halo we then adopt the values @xmath39 and a typical radius of @xmath45 kpc .",
    "notice that for the base state @xmath39 there is no oscillatory behavior in the rc ( figure 1 ) contrary to what the case with excited states ( figure 2 ) .    for the dwarf central density ( @xmath46 ) , we select two different values that encompass the range of masses found in dwarfs , @xmath47  m@xmath3  pc@xmath48 ( model a ) and a less massive one with @xmath49  m@xmath3  pc@xmath48 ( model b ) .    in figure [",
    "fig : halos ] , the dashed lines show the circular velocity , mass , and density associated with the sfdm halos of models a ( black ( blue online ) ) and b ( gray ( cyan online ) ) .",
    "the corresponding sfdm dwarf core radius ( defined as the radius at which the central density drops a factor of two ) is @xmath50  pc for both a and b models and its presence is distinctive prediction of the model .    to compare the sfdm profiles with other cored profiles ,",
    "we also consider the following profile @xcite @xmath51 for both a and b models , we set the scale radius @xmath52  kpc ( see solid lines of figure  [ fig : halos ] ) .    for our mass models , the mass of the dark halo enclosed at @xmath53 kpc lies in the range @xmath54-@xmath55 m@xmath3 .",
    "the resulting mass - to - light ratios represent dm dominated dsphs .",
    "for instance , the mass - to - light ratios of dsphs ( [ m / l]@xmath56 ) in the mw range from @xmath57  m@xmath3/l@xmath3 ( leo i , fornax ) to @xmath58  m@xmath3/l@xmath3 ( uma ii , seg , umai ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , draco has a very low luminosity but a high estimated total mass within the tidal radius of @xmath59  m@xmath3 @xcite , this leads to a high mass - to - light ratio of @xmath60@xcite .          in the sfdm model ,",
    "the fluctuations are expected to grow faster than in the standard model @xcite , implying that galaxies are fully formed at large redshifts .",
    "in fact , some recent high redshift observations suggest the existence of well formed galaxies very early in the universe @xcite . from the results of hydrodynamical cdm simulations that model the mw",
    ", one sees that its dark and luminous matter do not substantially change since @xmath61 ( @xmath62  gyr ago ) @xcite .",
    "then , for the initial conditions , we can assume a host with similar parameters that reproduce current mw data .",
    "we found that using @xmath63",
    "m@xmath3  pc@xmath48 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65  kpc ( see thick solid lines ( purple in the online version ) in figure  [ fig : halomw ] ) in equation  ( [ eq : sfdm ] ) gives a good representation to the mw dm in the sfdm model .",
    "although a detailed analysis of the mw with the sfdm is out of the scope of this work , we obtained the quoted values following the usual procedure of estimating the parameters that model our neighborhood , that is , we search the parameters consistent with the circular velocity in the solar neighborhood and the oort constants , we find a velocity @xmath42 200 km / s at 8.5 kpc and constants a=15.5 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 and b=-14.4 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 similar to previous works@xcite , we did the estimation when the disk is present and obtained the above values for the sfdm halo and the disk parameters reported following eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    for the mw",
    "s cored dm profile ( equation  [ eq : core ] ) , we set @xmath66  kpc . the corresponding circular velocity , mass and density of the cored dm halo ,",
    "are shown with gray lines ( pink in the online version ) in figure  [ fig : halomw ] .",
    "it has to be noted that , for both ( sfdm and cored ) mw halos , the core radius is @xmath67  kpc , and that the mass estimations within 100 kpc are comparable .",
    "therefore , the dm profiles are not identical but the total mass enclosed at the halo radius is the same . given that all our satellites have orbits inside this radius , we choose @xmath35=100 kpc , principally because our main focus is to study the tidal stripping of the stellar component of these satellites , whose apocenters never become larger than 100 kpc during the simulation , as the mw dark matter mass outside this radius is not essential to our study we can truncate the halo at that point , it then follows a keplerian decay for larger radii .",
    "the wiggles found in the halo and shown in figure [ fig : halomw ] are also a particular difference of this sfdm profile with respect to other core models .",
    "we simulate the evolution of the stellar component of the dwarf galaxy , which is embedded in a rigid sfdm halo potential using the @xmath68-body code @xcite .",

    "we rerun these two simulations to compare with the empirical profile ( eq . [ eq : core ] ) referred as @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we observe from figures  [ fig : vic1 ] and [ fig : vic2 ] that the dwarf galaxy survives unperturbed for @xmath99  gyr in models @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , from models @xmath88 , @xmath95 , @xmath89 , and @xmath96 , we observe that there is a negligible effect of the mw s baryonic disk on the dwarfs that are in sfdm subhalos .",
    "the fourth pair of simulations , named as a4 and b4 , resembles cases 3 but with @xmath101 , ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 are in figure [ fig : vic2 ] and figure  [ fig : vic4 ] ) .",
    "for model @xmath102 , the stellar component of the dwarf galaxy remains undisturbed , while the @xmath103 model shows a major star mass loss .",
    "we run an extra couple of simulations for completeness as discussed in the next section .",
    "table 1 summarizes all our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the dwarf galaxy stellar mass profile at @xmath104 and @xmath105 = 10  gyr in all our simulations . from the upper left panel in figure [ fig : mass ]",
    "we see that all @xmath106 models lose some particles , but the loss is not substantial and the galaxies survive with essentially the same initial mass after @xmath107  gyr .",
    "these simulations suggest that the density is high enough to strongly bind the stars and prevent the disruption of the satellite .",
    "a similar behavior is seen when a cuspy - like profile is used @xcite , making tidal disruption an inefficient process in both core and cusp - like subhalos to reduce their stellar mass within 1kpc and therefore making it not the relevant mechanism that decreases the abundance of massive dwarf satellites around mw - type galaxies , even for orbits with close pericenters of 14 kpc .",
    "the @xmath108 models for the sfdm halo show a slightly larger particle loss than the @xmath106 models ( upper right panel in figure 6 ) except for model @xmath103 which shows a more pronounced particle loss .",
    "the small central density of the sfdm dwarf subhalo , plays a crucial role in its survival .",
    "the final mass ( at @xmath109  gyr ) for @xmath108 models is smaller than the high @xmath106 density case in all cases .",
    "this shows that even if the orbit is far from the mw disk , whenever the dm subhalos have low densities the stars in the center are susceptible to spread out more than in denser halos as seen by comparing the two upper panels in figure [ fig : mass ] within 500 pc .",
    "one of the features that is seen from the stellar mass profiles is that the stars are not heavily stripped from the dwarf sfdm halo ( excluding model @xmath103 ) .",
    "this is reassuring as it implies the dm density profile is also not strongly modified in that region and may be approximated by a fixed halo profile for orbits without small pericenters .",
    "the result is strengthened with the findings of @xcite for live subhalos with @xmath91 and a core dm profile ; even in the presence of a live disk the dm subhalos remain almost the same in the central region after @xmath107  gyr .",
    "hence , the tidal effects on the subhalo are small within @xmath110  kpc , which is about the relevant core size of our simulated subhalo . therefore we consider that our approximation of a sfdm rigid halo is sufficient as long as the subhalos do not get well inside the disk of the host halo .",
    "simulations @xmath97 and @xmath111 present a similar behavior than their sfdm counterparts ( see upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) . in these cases",
    "the stars in the outskirts get stripped more easily , moving to larger radii and , at the same time , causing the inner stars to redistribute to a new configuration that follows the background dm halo potential . for cases",
    "a , the potential well is deep enough that only a few stars are lost ; most of them remain within 1 kpc and keep the same initial profile .",
    "the @xmath98 model has lost more mass than its analog @xmath96 ( see the upper right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mass ] ) .",
    "this is due to the slight difference in the tail of the subhalo mass profile ( @xmath37 > 2kpc ) and the fact that the potential is not as deep as in cases @xmath106 , making it easier for the tidal forces to change the central stellar distribution . from figure 1",
    "we note that subhalos with a core profile have a non zero density for @xmath37>2 kpc . for smaller @xmath112 the tidal stripping and",
    "the interaction with the disk becomes stronger , especially for the stars in the outermost radius which are more easily stripped .",
    "in fact , given that the subhalo in @xmath98 is more extended than in @xmath96 , more stars are likely to get pulled toward the tail of the halo but remain inside the subhalo . in this process the now outer stars drag some of the inner stars towards outer radii producing a more extended stellar distribution than in @xmath96 , reducing at the same time the stellar mass as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "the same occurs for the @xmath113 model and its counterpart @xmath103 ( see empty and full squares in figure  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "however , the considerable disruption in both @xmath103 simulations indicates the need to include the disruption of the halo . in our simulations ,",
    "the satellites still remain due to the assumption of fixed subhalo , but we expect the dwarf halos to fully disrupt and that their stars get dispersed around the mw halo .",
    "we also conducted a couple of simulations ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) where we set the dwarf galaxy embedded in the mw sfdm halo potential with a @xmath101 including the baryonic mw disk component and similar to @xmath102 and @xmath103 models , but now we place the dwarf galaxy in an orbit inclined @xmath116 from the @xmath90 plane . in this case we observe that the dwarf galaxy gets destroyed within @xmath117  gyr .",
    "this suggests that orbits with close pericenter distances and inclination effects are factors important to the survival of low density sfdm dwarf satellites .    in order to address the dependence of our results on the stellar mass we conducted the following two pairs of simulations . in @xmath118 and @xmath119 ,",
    "the parameters are identical to @xmath102 and @xmath111 respectively , but the stellar mass of the satellite is smaller m@xmath120.these parameters correspond to the closest orbit where the tidal effects should be the largest .",
    "the other pair , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , uses @xmath123 and the parameters of @xmath96 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "we do not use parameters of @xmath103 for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraphs .",
    "these cases are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] . in the bottom left of this figure",
    "we notice that the inner mass of the satellite reduces due to the proximity to the disk s influence but the potential well is again deep enough to ensure the survival of the satellite . in the bottom right panel of the same figure",
    "we see that both cases @xmath121 lead effectively to the same result ; despite their low masses the satellites can remain with most of their initial mass after 10 gyr .",
    "we point out that this is consistent with the arguments given above for @xmath98 . in @xmath122",
    "the satellite has a much smaller initial stellar mass concentrated within @xmath110kpc , thus fewer stars are stripped during its evolution and are insufficient to drag most of the central stars toward the outer regions as opposed to @xmath98 .",
    "nevertheless , we still observe a small effect of this process in this pair of simulations .    indeed ,",
    "comparing cases @xmath106 and @xmath108 , we notice that for the cases in which orbits are far from disk the density of the subhalo is a decisive parameter for determining the mass loss but has little influence in its survival .",
    "we found that the mass loss is greater if the subhalo has smaller density , but the dwarf galaxies still survive after 10 gyr .",
    "when the satellites have orbits close to the center of the host or when they strongly interact with the disk , the subhalo central density becomes an important factor for the survival and for the number of remaining satellites ; this is consistent with previous works .",
    "it is known that in cdm simulations , the satellites with cuspy subhalos can be stripped of stars but still survive as dm - only subhalos , which could be detected with gravitational lensing techniques . here",
    "we show that if the satellites are in scalar field subhalos with central densities comparable to classical dsphs , some of their stars are stripped but the galaxies can survive with smaller masses and hence contribute to the number of dwarf satellites around a mw host .",
    "it must be noted that , in the sfdm model , the substructure is smaller due to the wave properties causing the cut - off in the power spectrum , as confirmed in @xcite .",
    "our result can be tested with hydrodynamical sfdm cosmological simulations in the future .    for the lower density dwarfs ( comparable to ultra faint dwarfs )",
    ", we obtained that they could survive but only if their orbits do not get well inside the disks of their hosts . on the other hand ,",
    "low density halos with close pericenter orbits can be fully stripped of stars if evolved for a long time even with a fixed subhalo potential , but as mentioned before we expect them to be destroyed once the fixed halo hypothesis is relaxed .",
    "therefore , we do not get dm halos that are tiny and dark , contrary to the cdm predictions where the cusp prevents total disruption .",
    "the formation of ultra faint dwarfs is still not clear but it is thought that they are the result of more massive dwarfs that were disrupted and left them as low density systems .",
    "we have seen that in the scenario of sfdm , depending on their distance to their host , these faint systems could also be produced from disrupted dwarfs with initial core profiles in the same way that they are when halos are assumed to have cusp profiles @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results point to an alternative solution to the satellite overabundance problem and the cusp - core issue by means of the quantum dm properties of the scalar field without relying strongly on the messy astrophysical processes . here",
    ", small mass subhalos with core profiles ( @xmath124 ) and with orbits not crossing the host s disk are able to survive for a long time ; otherwise the close encounters with the disk could completely destroy them .",
    "on the other hand , more massive dwarfs can get closer or farther from the host disk and still survive with core profiles . to determine the final fate of these galaxies and test the results from the present work",
    ", we will need simulations that involve the complexities of astrophysics , but we leave that for a future work .    from eq .",
    "( 3 ) we see that for larger excited states the inner region becomes more compact and the halo core sizes can become smaller . in general",
    "a superposition of states may be present in a sfdm halo@xcite , however , in @xcite they found that for a stable multi - state sfdm halo the number of bosons in excited states should decrease with increasing @xmath31 , for instance , in a multi - state composed of the ground(@xmath31=1 ) and first excited states ( @xmath31=2 ) the number of bosons in @xmath31=2 should be less than or equal to those in @xmath31=1 if the halo is to be stable , hence small core sizes are expected in massive galaxies , i.e. , those where the sf ground state provides a poor description , depending on the required number of excited states in the halo the core size can become smaller . given that dwarf galaxies are consistent with halos with only @xmath31=1 , and from to the stability constraint in the sfdm halos any contribution of higher energy states will be subdominant in such halos and the core sizes are dictated by the dominant ground state , being of @xmath42 kpc for a boson mass of @xmath4210@xmath125 ev/@xmath1 . by fitting galaxies of different sizes it is possible to constrain the number of states in the sfdm halos required to agree with observations .",
    "as noted before , dwarfs seem to lie in ground state sfdm halos , while larger galaxies seem to require more than that , however , at this point it is unclear whether there is a mechanism that predicts the final superposition of a given sfdm halo ; a statistical analysis fitting galaxies of different morphological types and sizes is required to derive such a relation .    additionally ,",
    "although we use a single state(@xmath31=4 ) as a fit to the mw , we have not addressed its stability .",
    "looking at the more general sfdm halo scenario mentioned above , it remains to be shown under what circumstances the interplay of the different particle states within a sfdm halo , in our case a mw - like halo , can lead to a stable halo with a non - negligible fraction of bosons in a single state that extends to large radii ; this is something that needs to be addressed at a later time and will be vital to the viability of sfdm .",
    "in this paper we explored within the context of the sfdm the influence that tidal forces have on an stellar distribution that is embedded in a sfdm halo with the distinctive feature of a flat central density .",
    "the satellite orbits around a dark matter halo with parameters that resemble those of the mw also modeled with a scalar field dm halo .",
    "in general , the survival of a satellite depends on effects like its orbit , density , supernova explosions , its star formation history , and merger history in case that a hierarchical model is assumed among other factors .",
    "here we focused our analysis on the mass loss of a satellite galaxy hosted by a dm subhalo with two flat central density profiles : one that is predicted by the sfdm model as a consequence of the uncertainty principle , preventing the divergence of the central density , and the second profile which is a widely used empirical model , describing core - like mass distributions , frequently encountered in the literature .",
    "we explored different central densities for the halo and concentrated on the stellar evolution under various orbits and different stellar masses for both halo models .",
    "our results show that objects like draco , with presumably large core sizes today , may have a simple explanation for their observed flat light distribution in the sfdm model because the stellar distribution remains bound even for tight orbits .",
    "a similar result was found in the context of cdm halos but on the condition of choosing more specific orbits @xcite .",
    "also , all galaxies in our @xmath106 cases with core profiles survive for 10 gyr . thus dwarf galaxies",
    "that were accreted a long time ago will still persist as satellites with perhaps slighltly smaller mass depending on the proximity of their orbits to their hosts . a comparison with the number of satellites is out of the scope of this work because for such a comparison we need to consider the uncertainties associated to specific details of the host formation and any recent major mergers that it could have had .",
    "simulations addressing this issue would be desirable .",
    "we also find a difference in the properties of the ultra faints ; we showed that tidal disruption is also a mechanism for producing ultra faint dwarfs out of more massive dwarfs .",
    "nevertheless the disruption does not produce a substantial change in the slope of the inner density profile .",
    "therefore , even with the same mechanism used in cdm to form an ultra faint dwarf there is a stark difference with cdm halos in their final density slopes .",
    "in fact , while cores are a direct consequence in sfdm , cdm halos rely on effective supernovae feedback to form cores a long time ago , otherwise they are expected to retain their divergent mass profile which may be used to differentiate these models in the future .    regarding the too - big - to - fail issue , to make a fair comparison with cdm simulations we will need a cosmological simulation that models the dark matter as a scalar field in order to study the number of the most massive halos around mw - sized hosts and determine if this represents a challenge in the sfdm model .",
    "we think that further exploring the sfdm looks promising due to the possible natural solutions that it proposes to long - standing issues of the cdm model .",
    "baryonic processes should be included in sfdm simulations as they can be more directly compared with observations .",
