    "stars with low and intermediate initial mass ( from 1 to 8@xmath2 ) loose their atmospheres towards the end of their lives ( 110gyr after their birth ) .",
    "this mass loss is intense ; approximately 5080% of the stellar mass is lost during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase . understanding this process and the composition of the gas lost from agb stars is important for understanding both stellar and galactic evolution .",
    "first , the stellar wind removes material from agb stars , reducing their mass and influencing their evolution .",
    "secondly , agb stars are among the primary sources of metal - enriched gas and dust grains in the interstellar medium of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , carbon - rich dust grains are formed solely in carbon - rich agb stars @xcite .",
    "theoretical work has suggested that agb mass - loss rates depend on metallicity @xcite , because the stellar wind is triggered by radiation pressure on dust grains and the dust is made up of astronomical metals , such as oxygen , carbon , silicon , iron and aluminium .",
    "therefore a study of extra - galactic agb stars is vital , both because it allows us to study mass loss at low metallicity , and because the distances to the parent galaxies are known , so that stellar parameters can be derived with some precision .",
    "a high sensitivity mid - infrared instrument is required for such a mass - loss study ; at present this is provided uniquely by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .",
    "the fornax dsph galaxy is the second ( after sagittarius ) most luminous dsph galaxy known in the local group .",
    "the metallicity of red giants has been measured to be as low as [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath7/h ] = log ( @xmath7/h)-log(@xmath7/h)@xmath8 where log ( h)=12 is the abundance of hydrogen by number of atoms .",
    "the metallicity of the galaxy is represented by iron abundance.]=@xmath9 and @xmath10 with a mean value of @xmath11 @xcite . this value is lower than that found in the lmc ( @xmath12 ; median value of red giants in the bar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the smc ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity of agb stars has not yet been determined in these galaxies , except for one agb star in the smc , which has been estimated at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent , within the error , with the values quoted above for red giants .",
    "thus , the fornax dsph is an ideal target to explore the lower metallicity range .",
    "fornax has globular clusters ; their ages range from 7 to 14 gyrs @xcite .",
    "@xcite found three distinct periods of star forming activity in the galaxy .",
    "the dominant population , to which the agb stars are most likely to belong , is 2 to 8 gyr old . there may have experienced star - forming activity until a few times @xmath16years ago , but this young population is small .",
    "fornax is gas poor at the present time ; @xcite reported a non - detection of h gas , although @xcite have detected more distant gas possibly associated with fornax .",
    "the distance modulus of the fornax dsph is quoted as : @xmath17=20.76mag @xcite , @xmath17=20.70@xmath180.12mag @xcite and @xmath17=20.74@xmath180.11mag @xcite .",
    "these values are consistent and we adopt 20.76mag in this paper . the fornax dsph galaxy is elliptical in shape and the major axis is longer than the minor axis by a factor of at least two @xcite . the thickness of the galaxy is negligible at its distance .",
    "the interstellar reddening towards fornax is @xmath19 @xcite , and its effect is negligible in the infrared .",
    "@xcite found red giants in the fornax dsph galaxy and @xcite established that some of these are ( agb ) carbon stars .",
    "@xcite claim to have detected 104 carbon rich stars in this galaxy .",
    "because of its low metallicity , relatively close distance , and reasonable number of agb stars , the fornax dsph is an ideal galaxy to study the influence of metallicity on the evolution of agb stars .",
    "as follow - up to our spitzer spectroscopic survey of agb stars in the lmc @xcite and the smc @xcite , we have undertaken spectral observations of carbon stars in fornax , using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite on the _ spitzer space telescope_. this study aims to investigate the spectra of the agb stars and to ascertain the influence of metallicity on agb mass - loss rates and on the composition of molecules and dust grains , down to a metallicity of one tenth of the solar value .",
    "our target selection is based on a monitoring program with the infrared survey facility ( irsf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at sutherland in south africa ( menzies et al . in preparation ) .",
    "table  [ table - targets ] lists the five targets together with their coordinates and cross - identifications .",
    "photometric measurements of the targets from the literature are summarised in table[table - magnitudes ] .",
    "the variability of these stars will be discussed elsewhere ( menzies et al . in preparation ) , but all of them show large amplitude periodic changes , and are most likely mira variables . this variability will result in spectral changes if the stars are indeed miras , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig - cm ] shows an infrared colour - magnitude diagram of our targets , where they are compared with lmc stars .",
    "our sample is located on the sequence of lmc agb stars , although the fornax stars tend to have fainter @xmath20 magnitudes than do lmc stars with similar @xmath21 colours .",
    "our three red carbon - rich stars ( fornax 13 - 23 , 12 - 4 , and 3 - 129 ) are redder in @xmath21 than anything described in a recent near - infrared survey of fornax @xcite and probably have the thickest shells of any agb stars in that galaxy .    the fornax dsph galaxy is roughly elliptical in shape , although the ellipticity varies slightly depending on the distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "all of our targets are located within an ellipse of 0.4deg semi - major axis and ellipticity of 0.3 ( see @xcite their fig.1 ; fig.[fig - fornax ] in our work ) .",
    "a colour - magnitude diagram of fornax @xcite shows the ` agb bump ' , which marks the beginning of the agb phase ; stars in this bump belong to an intermediate age population . because of the typical age of agb stars , it is most likely that our targets also belong to the intermediate age population , which has a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "contamination by young ( @xmath231gyr ) carbon stars is possible , but not likely .",
    "such young carbon stars would have high luminosities , close to the agb luminosity limit , which are not found for any of our sample ( fig.[fig - cm ] ) .",
    "in addition , the population of such young carbon stars must be small .",
    "@xcite found [ fe / h]@xmath24 among some red giants from optical high spectral resolution observations , but the majority were between @xmath25 and @xmath26 according to the medium resolution spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "the median of the ` current ' metallicity of red giants is [ fe / h]@xmath27 according to spectroscopic observations of over a hundred stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a planetary nebula , which is carbon - rich , shows [ fe / h]@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that [ fe / h]@xmath29 is a reasonable assumption for the population we are dealing with .",
    "two of our targets were identified as carbon stars by @xcite .",
    "the other three targets were not included in their sample , because they selected carbon stars with @xmath30 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are modeled using the radiative transfer code dusty @xcite .",
    "the quality of these sed fits with the observations are illustrated in fig.[fig - dusty ] .",
    "a spherical geometry is assumed for the circumstellar envelope , and the circumstellar shells are filled with material from the radiatively driven wind , which is moving at a constant velocity .",
    "the photospheric spectrum of the central star is calculated with a hydrostatic model including molecular opacities @xcite .",
    "an effective temperature of 2800k is adopted .",
    "we also tried a 2650k spectrum which often worked well for stars in the lmc and smc @xcite , but this lower temperature did not result in a good fit for the fornax spectra .",
    "this may be a consequence of the difference between the samples from the various galaxies ; the lmc and smc stars have redder @xmath21 colours ( fig.[fig - cm ] ) .",
    "as details of carbon to oxygen ratios are unknown , a c / o ratio of 1.1 is assumed in the hydrostatic model .",
    "although this is typical of values found for galactic carbon stars , at lower metallicity the c / o ratio may well be higher @xcite .",
    "the assumed c / o ratio affects most strongly the depth of molecular bands , and we minimize its impact by concentrating on a relatively featureless wavelength range of the spectra for this particular exercise .",
    "furthermore , the elemental abundances ( except for carbon ) used by dusty modelling are the solar values @xcite , which are also inappropriate for stars in fornax . in spite of these limitations , we prefer the hydrostatic model spectra over simple blackbodies ( bbs ) .",
    "we compared sed fits using blackbody curves the star and hydrostatic model spectra as a heating input of dusty .",
    "the simple blackbody requires a lower optical depth to reproduce the sed .",
    "for example , fornax 13 - 23 and fornax 3 - 129 are fitted with @xmath313.0 , and 8.25 with bb input , respectively .",
    "however , the models with bb input have difficult in fitting near - infrared spectra . the low optical depth required by the bb model",
    "is probably a consequence of the lack of molecular absorption , thus the more efficient heating of grains especially at shorter wavelength .    the temperature at the inner radius of the dust shell is assumed to be 1000k @xcite .",
    "dust grains are a mixture of amorphous carbon @xcite and sic @xcite .",
    "the fractions which give the best fit are 5% sic and 95% amorphous carbon .",
    "we also attempted to fit the observed sic bands with 3% and 10% sic mixtures , but the former does not create any sic bands at 11@xmath32 m , while the latter produces sic bands that are too strong to fit the spectra of our targets .",
    "the grain size distribution is assumed to be @xmath33 to 0.25@xmath32 m according to a power - law distribution of the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xcite",
    ". a gas - to - dust ratio of 200 is the default of dusty .",
    "although we note that the ratio might be higher at lower metallicity @xcite , no dependence has yet been measured .",
    "this ratio is important when the optical depth is converted to the mass - loss rate .",
    "the outer radius of the shell is fixed at @xmath36 times the inner radius of the circumstellar shell .",
    "changing the outer radius has minor effects on the sed @xcite .",
    "the dusty model fit produces the terminal outflow velocity and mass - loss rate for a luminosity of @xmath37 .",
    "as we derive the luminosity by scaling the emerging spectrum from dusty , we recalculate the dust mass - loss rate accordingly .    the dusty model itself",
    "has an uncertainty of 30% in mass - loss rate and expansion velocity , as noted in the dusty manual .      figs .",
    "[ fig - dusty ] and [ fig - dusty - lin ] shows the model fits to the spectra and the parameters used for these fits are listed in table[table - dusty ] .",
    "we use three spectra which show clear sic excesses to fit the 11.3@xmath32 m sic excess and the general shape of the sed .",
    "we attempted to fit the other two spectra with negligible sic excess ( fornax 4 - 25 and fornax 6 - 13 ) and found that the optical depth at 0.55@xmath32 m was @xmath38 .",
    "the fornax 4 - 25 and 6 - 13 spectra seem to be photospheric in origin , with little circumstellar contribution to the infrared . integrating over the @xmath39 photometry and the spitzer spectra of fornax 6 - 13 ,",
    "using spline fitting @xcite , we obtained a luminosity of 5721@xmath40 ; fitting gave an upper limit to the mass - loss rate of @xmath41@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "the same spline fitting is adopted for fornax 4 - 25 , using @xmath42 and spitzer spectra , resulting in a luminosity of 5621@xmath40 , but with lower accuracy than for the other targets .",
    "an upper limit to the mass - loss rate is @xmath41@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "these photometric observations are not simultaneous with the spitzer measurements , in contrast to the study by @xcite , increasing the uncertainty in the instantaneous luminosities .    there are some features which the dusty models do not fit well , in particular the 7.5@xmath32 m and 13.7@xmath32 m absorptions due to c@xmath5h@xmath5 .",
    "a similar problem was also found in fitting some lmc and smc agb spectra @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecular bands are included in the model for the stellar atmosphere , which is used as an input to dusty models , but the observed bands are stronger than predicted . as discussed later , the parameters used in the models are appropriate for galactic stars , and the metallicity dependence of the molecular band strengths may well contribute to this problem",
    ". there could be additional effects , such as some c@xmath5h@xmath5 originating from the extended atmosphere which is lifted by the pulsation above the photosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "circumstellar molecular absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also not included in dusty .",
    "the mass - loss rates for the three reddest stars are of the order of @xmath43@xmath44",
    ". this would be only a moderate mass - loss rate for galactic carbon stars .",
    "the comparison assumes that the gas - to - dust ratio in the fornax dsph galaxy is the same as in our galaxy .",
    "the bolometric luminosities estimated from fitting a radiative transfer model are comparable to other estimates , such as those from near - infrared , @xmath21 , colours @xcite .",
    "the values range between @xmath45$]=3.9 and 4.1 , which is comparable to the mean luminosities found for carbon stars in the lmc , but slightly higher than those found for smc stars @xcite .",
    "fig.[lum_massloss ] shows the derived mass - loss rate as a function of luminosity and a comparison with values for lmc and smc stars @xcite .",
    "little metallicity dependence of the mass - loss rate is found , at least for the dust mass - loss rate .",
    "the fornax mass - loss rates are at the upper end of the smc mass - loss rates at a given luminosity .",
    "however , we are unable to fit the fornax stars with lower mass - loss rates ( fornax 4 - 25 & fornax 6 - 13 ) , so there is an obvious selection effect .",
    "lmc stars appear to reach a higher mass - loss rate than the smc and fornax stars at a given luminosity , as noted by @xcite .",
    "the assumptions made in deriving the total mass - loss rates are the expansion velocity of the circumstellar shell and the conversion factor from dust mass - loss rate to gas mass - loss rate .",
    "@xcite assumed an expansion velocity of 10kms@xmath3 for all the stars in their study .",
    "the velocity is derived from dusty fitting in our work and we find that the fornax stars have expansion velocities in the 16 to 25kms@xmath3 range .",
    "this gives us larger mass - loss rates for the fornax stars by a factor of up to 2.5 over those obtained from the @xcite assumption .",
    "nevertheless , in the log scale of fig.[lum_massloss ] , this is a minor effect .",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio is assumed to be 200 in both this work and by @xcite .",
    "this ratio may have a metallicity dependence , and @xcite estimates @xmath46[z / h ] for carbon stars , where @xmath47 is the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "if this is correct , the gas - to - dust ratio in fornax will be about twice what it is in the smc and the fornax stars will have higher gas mass - loss rates than derived above .",
    "we discuss this further below ( sect.[metal - dependence ] ) .",
    "fig.[color_massloss ] shows the mass - loss rate as a function of infrared colour .",
    "the wavelength bands are defined so as to avoid major molecular or dust features , thus the colour measures the ` continuum ' spectrum reasonably well . in fig.[color_massloss ] , a correlation is found between the infrared colour and the mass - loss rate . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "this colour gives the approximate mass - loss rate with a factor of two to five uncertainty , depending on the colour .",
    "@xcite estimated the dust mass - loss rate of two of the sources in our sample , using the infrared colour index @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "their dust mass - loss rates have been converted to gas mass - loss rates assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 200 and are listed in table[table - dusty ] ; they are consistent with our estimates to within a factor of two",
    ". at least some of the difference will be due to the input stellar spectra , i.e. , our work uses a hydrostatic model while @xcite assume a blackbody .",
    "nevertheless , the consistency shows that the infrared colour method can be used to estimate the mass - loss rates , as found for galactic agb stars @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared colour also shows a correlation with mass - loss rate ( fig.[color_massloss ] ) , especially when using colours that minimize the influence of strong molecular bands .",
    "note that unlike some colour measurements , e.g. @xmath49 $ ] , our values are constructed from spectra and are therefore simultaneous and not affected by variability .",
    "the carbon stars in the fornax dsph galaxy tend to have fainter absolute @xmath50 magnitudes at a given @xmath21 colour ( fig.[fig - cm ] ) than lmc carbon stars .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the mean magnitudes of carbon - rich stars at the tip of the agb are @xmath23@xmath20@xmath51mag and @xmath23@xmath20@xmath52mag for the lmc and smc , respectively , while the mean magnitude of 26 carbon stars in fornax gives @xmath23@xmath20@xmath53mag .",
    "the difference between the lmc and smc samples was also discussed in ( fig .  2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite concluded that the low @xmath23@xmath20@xmath54 is due to the lack of younger ( 0.31  gyr ) carbon stars in fornax .",
    "the population analysis by @xcite also supports this interpretation ; the star formation rate declined during the period from a few hundred gyr to 1gyr ago , so we are unlikely to find young ( 0.31 gyr ) carbon stars in fornax . in other words ,",
    "agb stars in the fornax dsph galaxy are , on average , probably older than those found in the lmc and the smc .",
    "the ratio of sic to continuum is smaller in fornax stars than in our galaxy or in the lmc , but comparable to that in the smc .",
    "the fornax spectra are well fitted if the mixture of dust grains is 5% sic and 95% amorphous carbon , although the error in our estimate is large .",
    "as @xcite found , the fraction of sic dust grains is lower in carbon stars in the lmc and smc than those in our galaxy ( 10% ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "stars in the fornax dsph galaxy follow this same trend with metallicity .",
    "the fraction of sic dust in the grains is probably correlated with the silicon elemental abundance in the atmospheres of carbon stars .",
    "the temperature in the helium burning shell does not become high enough for @xmath55-captures on magnesium , and the abundance of @xmath56si can be assumed to be unchanged during the agb phase .",
    "the abundance of silicon has been measured in two red - giants in the fornax dsph galaxy @xcite .",
    "they find silicon abundances in metal poor stars higher than implied by a simple scaling from the metallicity as represented by [ fe / h ] .",
    "these two stars have approximately 5 and 25% of the solar silicon abundance ( [ si / h]=@xmath26 and @xmath57 ) , while their iron abundances are [ fe / h]=@xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the metal - poor star shows a silicon abundance excess , presumably due to the detailed history of its formation @xcite .    a mass fraction of 5%  sic grains and a gas - to - dust ratio of 200 in mass , implies that 25%  of the silicon atoms are in the dust , if the envelope has a solar metallicity . here",
    "we assume the solar abundance of silicate is 7.55 , on a scale of log n(h)=12 .",
    "for [ si / h]=@xmath57 , _ all _ silicon atoms would need to be in the sic dust grains .",
    "we expect our stars to have somewhat lower metallicity , corresponding to the peak of the stellar metallicity distribution , say [ fe / h]@xmath27 and the silicon abundance ( [ si / h ] ) could be @xmath60 . inverting the estimation , the gas - to - dust ratio needs to be @xmath61 or larger , to account for the sic mass fraction of 5% .",
    "if we consider the uncertainty in this estimate of the sic fraction , then the gas - to - dust ratio must be in the range 800 to 240 to provide a fraction of 10% to 3% of the dust as sic .",
    "this may be the first , albeit indirect , indication for a higher gas - to - dust ratio at significantly sub - solar metallicity .",
    "if it is correct , then the mass - loss rates in agb stars at these low metallicities could be even higher than values given in table[table - dusty ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the gas - to - dust ratio discussed here largely depends on the uncertainty of our estimated sic fraction .",
    "various parameters , but particularly the optical constants of the dust grains and the dust grain size distribution , require refinement if further progress is to be made .",
    "furthermore , the exact compositions mixed in with the sic dust grains @xcite might change towards lower metallicity , resulting in different sic dust masses .",
    "although it is possible that the gas - to - dust ratio increases at lower metallicity the actual values remain very uncertain . due to these uncertainties , we continue to assume that the gas - to - dust ratio is 200 for the remaining discussion .",
    "the dust mass is dominated by amorphous carbon .",
    "the quantity of amorphous carbon grains is affected by two factors , viz .",
    "c / o ratio @xcite and initial metallicity @xcite .",
    "the lack of evidence for lower mass - loss rates at lower metallicity is explained with a higher c / o ratio towards low metallicity .",
    "a strong dependence of mass - loss rate on c / o ratio is reported from hydrodynamical models for carbon - rich stars @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the stability of the co molecule ; in carbon stars all available oxygen atoms are locked into carbon monoxide and excess carbon atoms are available to form carbon - bearing molecules and amorphous carbon dust grains . as new carbon atoms reach the surface of these agb stars , the c / o ratio increases and the amount of carbon available to form grains also increases .",
    "the c / o abundance of the target stars in the lmc , the smc and fornax have not been measured directly .",
    "a number of carbon stars in the smc have c / o ratios of 1.05 to 1.1 @xcite .",
    "that sample probably contains blue carbon stars , which have little or no circumstellar envelope .",
    "the c / o ratio increases towards the end of the agb phase , but such stars develop a thick circumstellar envelope and hydrostatic models can not be used for them , because the molecular lines are filled in by emission from circumstellar dust grains .",
    "c / o ratios above 2 are found in lmc and smc pne @xcite . at metallicities below those of the smc and lmc , the final c /",
    "o ratios are expected to be even higher due to low initial oxygen abundance , and an additional effect of efficient third - dredge up @xcite .",
    "the c / o ratios of our targets are therefore likely to significantly exceed 1.1 , leading to the observed efficient amorphous dust production .",
    "this result i.e. , the lack of dependence of mass - loss rates on metallicity for carbon - rich stars , is in contrast to what is found for oxygen - rich stars , where there is an obvious metallicity dependence @xcite . this is because dust driven winds in oxygen - rich stars are dominated by the amount of silicate , and ultimately by the intrinsic silicon elemental abundance @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocities of oxygen - rich shells are also smaller at low metallicities @xcite . in contrast , carbon stars are strongly affected by carbon production during the agb phase ; thus the different dependence of mass - loss rate on metallicity can be understood .",
    "the molecular band strengths of carbon - rich stars show a metallicity dependence @xcite .",
    "recent studies using infrared spectrometers on the very large telescope @xcite showed that the c@xmath5h@xmath5 equivalent widths increase towards lower metallicity , based on samples from the galaxy , the lmc and the smc .",
    "the carbon - rich stars in the fornax dsph galaxy follow the same trend of as those found in similar smc stars . for infrared colours [ 6.4]@xmath62[9.3]@xmath540.5 , the largest c@xmath5h@xmath5 equivalent widths",
    "are found for stars in the smc and the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "although fornax has a lower metallicity than the smc , no further metallicity dependence is seen below the smc value .    as discussed in the previous section , a higher c / o ratio is likely in carbon - rich stars at lower metallicity .",
    "c@xmath5h@xmath5 formation relies on excess carbon atoms after all oxygen atoms are locked into carbon monoxide .",
    "thus the higher c / o ratio results in the higher abundance of c@xmath5h@xmath5 at lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "fig.13 in @xcite shows that the fraction of c@xmath5h@xmath5 in the atmosphere increases drastically up to c / o @xmath63 , but at ratios higher than this the amount of c@xmath5h@xmath5 increases only slowly .",
    "this is because c@xmath5h@xmath5 is reactive with carbon resulting in increasingly larger carbon bearing molecules .",
    "thus , below the smc metallicity , little metallicity dependence of the c@xmath5h@xmath5 equivalent width is found , because this molecular abundance becomes insensitive to the c / o ratio .",
    "c@xmath5h@xmath5 is thought to be a parent molecule in the formation of pahs , as indicated by chemical models @xcite .",
    "it is still unknown whether pahs are formed during the agb phase or afterwards .",
    "they may already form in the atmospheres or inner circumstellar envelopes of carbon - rich agb stars , where the gas density is reasonably high and chemical reactions occur easily @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of pahs from agb stars might be due to a lack of uv radiation , which is probably required to excite pahs .",
    "pahs might be photon - processed during post - agb evolution @xcite .",
    "alternatively , pahs may be formed during the post - agb or proto - planetary nebula phase , where pahs are commonly found .",
    "the chemistry in this phase is dominated by strong radiation from the central star @xcite .",
    "if pahs are indeed formed during the agb phase , an over - abundance of c@xmath5h@xmath5 in a low metal environment will affect the growth of these important molecules .",
    "the overabundance of c@xmath5h@xmath5 at low metallicity will remain through the post - agb phase , as is illustrated by the fact that the lmc post - agb star smp11 has more abundant carbon - bearing molecules @xcite than comparable galactic post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a lower limit of c / o = 2 for one lmc post - agb star .",
    "this overabundance of c@xmath5h@xmath5 may also occur in an smc post - agb star @xcite .",
    "thus , at sub - solar metallicity , it is likely that c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecules are abundant in carbon - rich evolved stars .      from near - infrared colours",
    ", @xcite found about 100 agb candidates in the centre ( 18.5@xmath6418.5arcmin@xmath3 ) of the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "their infrared colours suggest that at least 20 of these agb stars are carbon - rich ( @xmath65 and @xmath6614mag ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the reddest carbon stars found by @xcite have @xmath67mag . an estimate of mass - loss rate can be obtained from the @xmath21 colors of these 20 agb stars of the order of @xmath68@xmath2yr@xmath3 or less , although this number is not very precise owing to the large dispersion of the @xmath21 vs mass - loss rate relation found by @xcite . including our carbon stars , the total mass - loss rate from known carbon - rich stars in fornax dsph galaxy",
    "is estimated to be about @xmath6@xmath2yr@xmath3 at most , adopting a gas - to - dust ratio of 200 .",
    "three stars in our sample ( fornax 13 - 23 , 12 - 4 , 3 - 129 ) contribute more than two thirds of the total mass - loss rate . studies of galactic agb stars showed that stars with higher mass - loss rates ( above @xmath69@xmath2yr@xmath3 ) dominate the total gas output from agb stars @xcite . therefore the much bluer agb stars in fornax",
    "are assumed to contribute very little to the total mass lost from the entire agb population .",
    "this total mass - loss rate is smaller than the value found for wolf lundmark melotte ( wlm ) , a dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group with a similar metallicity range to fornax .",
    "@xcite estimated the total mass - loss rate from agb stars as [ 0.72.4]@xmath70@xmath2yr@xmath3 , which is a factor of 50 larger in wlm than the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "the number ratio of carbon- to oxygen - rich stars is reported to be 12 in wlm @xcite ; thus the mass - loss rate from carbon - rich stars is almost identical to that from the entire agb population .",
    "the visual absolute magnitudes ( @xmath71 ) of the galaxies are @xmath72 and @xmath73 for wlm and fornax , respectively .",
    "if @xmath71 is a measure of the number of stars in a galaxy , wlm has a 2 to 3 times larger the number of stars than fornax has ; the number of stars in the galaxies is insufficient to explain the difference in total mass - loss rate from carbon - rich stars .",
    "the assumed gas - to - dust ratio is a factor of 6 to 13 larger in @xcite , but still not sufficient to explain the result .",
    "the difference might be caused by the presence of younger stars in wlm , and the absence of such stars in fornax . in wlm ,",
    "a recent increase in star formation rate is indicated starting 12.5gyr ago @xcite .",
    "young ( @xmath74gyr ) carbon stars dominate the mass output from agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this population is missing in the fornax dsph galaxy .    as a dwarf irregular galaxy",
    ", wlm has a much larger hi mass than the fornax dsph : 40%  of its total mass compared to @xmath75 for fornax @xcite .",
    "a removal of gas from dsph in early phase is a consequence of this that difference @xcite .",
    "however , the feedback from the young agb stars also accentuates the difference in gaseous contents , on top of the influence of the galaxy s initial gas content .",
    "the absolute magnitude of fornax 4 - 25 is estimated as @xmath76mag , using the @xmath50 magnitude and colour dependent bolometric correction @xcite .",
    "the period - luminosity relation for galactic carbon stars @xcite gives @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the period in days , for this luminosity .",
    "the observed period of fornax 4 - 15 is @xmath79 @xcite , thus this fornax star fits on the period - luminosity relation for galactic stars very well .",
    "no obvious metallicity dependence has been found for the agb period - luminosity relation .",
    "this period and mass - loss rate relation for galactic star gives mass - loss rate of @xmath80@xmath2yr@xmath3 at @xmath79 .",
    "this mass - loss rate is consistent with the upper limit ( @xmath41@xmath2yr@xmath3 ) obtained by this work is consistent .",
    "the 514@xmath32 m spectra of agb stars in the fornax dsph galaxy confirm the prevalence of carbon - rich stars at low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath81 ) .",
    "stars with @xmath82 show spectra dominated by c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecules , together with co bands and sic dust excess , while only a trace of the 7.5@xmath32 m c@xmath5h@xmath5 is found in stars with @xmath83 .",
    "detection of the sic dust excess shows that these agb stars have developed circumstellar envelopes through mass loss .",
    "we compare our results for fornax with carbon - rich stars in our own galaxy , the lmc and the smc .",
    "the fornax dsph galaxy is the lowest metallicity galaxy for which the carbon - rich star population has been studied in the mid - infrared .",
    "the c@xmath5h@xmath5 molecular bands , with respect to the infrared colour , tend to be stronger towards lower metallicity .",
    "no reduction in the mass - loss rate is found for lower - metallicity carbon stars .",
    "the dust composition does depend on the metallicity , with a lower mass - fraction of sic dust grains , but the amount of amorphous carbon , which constitutes the dominant fraction of dust grains , seem to be unchanged . if the fraction of sic dust grain is correct , the gas - to - dust ratio could be as high as 400 at one tenth of the solar metallicity , but a more detailed investigation of gas mass - loss rates is required .",
    "this study of agb mass loss in a low - metallicity environment should be broadly useful for other studies of dust and gas recycling within metal poor galaxies .",
    "our study reveals that the gas supply from agb stars into the interstellar medium is not lower at lower metallicity , but the fraction of sic dust grains does appear to be lower .",
    "the total amount of gas expelled from agb stars is less in the fornax dsph galaxy than in the dwarf irregular wlm , in spite of a similar total mass and metallicity .",
    "the difference is attributed to the younger stellar population in wlm .",
