    "the fluorescence at steady - state was proportional to the number of atoms in the mot .",
    "in contrast to alkali atoms , tm mot at 410.6  nm normally can operate without a repumping laser  @xcite because the cooling radiation acts as a repumper itself and return atoms which were optically pumped to @xmath19 back to @xmath13 via @xmath20 .",
    "frequency scan of 530.7 nm laser across @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances resulted in corresponding dips in the mot fluorescence ( see fig .",

    "we identified two transitions by the different fluorescence dynamics as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motfluorescence](b ) .",
    "excitation of an atom to the @xmath23 component of the upper level would predominantly be followed by a spontaneous decay to @xmath19 sublevel of the ground state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rellev ] ) and loss of the atom from the mot .",
    "after the laser frequency was tuned out of this resonance , the population of mot recovered with the trap loading time constant ( 200  ms ) .",
    "in contrast , when the laser frequency was scanned through the cyclic @xmath22 transition , the number of atoms in the mot remained unchanged and the fluorescence signal recovered promptly .",
    "the latter happened because exited atoms were slow enough to stay in the trapping region ( the radiative decay time @xmath24 of investigated level is about 460 ns ) .    to verify our understanding of the underlying processes we repeated the described experiment , but applied an additional repumping laser beam of 2.4  mw ( 1  w/@xmath18 ) at 410.6  nm that pumped the atoms from the hyperfine @xmath19 sublevel back to @xmath13 of the ground state through the @xmath20 sublevel ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : sasetup ]    the described above mot - loss measurement of hfs did not provide enough accuracy due to the complicated resonance profiles and insufficiently accurate frequency scan calibration . for more accurate measurement we used frequency modulation saturated absorption spectroscopy in a vapor cell  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sasetup ] .",
    "tm vapor stainless steel cell at the temperature of about 720  c was enclosed in a magnetic shield . to stabilize the frequency of the 530.7  nm laser we locked it to a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity using pound - driver - hall technique  @xcite .",
    "stabilization provided the expected laser line width below 100  hz  @xcite .",
    "long - term drift of fabri - perot cavity was measured to be 1.3  khz / s by monitoring the frequency interval between the @xmath22 resonance and a particular tem@xmath25 mode of the cavity .    in our configuration",
    "the probe beam was formed by reflecting the pump beam . since saturated absorption is accompanied by power broadening of the transition , it was advantageous to reduce the laser power to the lowest level . to detect weak absorption signals we used frequency modulation of the laser beam and lock - in detection .",
    "the modulation at the frequency of 60 khz was applied using the acousto - optical modulator aom-2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sasetup ] ) .",
    "central frequency of aom-2 was 203  mhz .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath13 hyperfine components of the ground state were initially populated almost equally at the cell temperature of 720  c. we extracted the frequency difference of the transitions @xmath22 and @xmath26 from the lock - in amplified saturated absorption signal .    for frequency scanning we used aom-1 driven by signal of rf - generator centered at 211  mhz .",
    "scan range of aom was about 50  mhz and did not allow to cover the 614  mhz frequency gap between the @xmath22 and @xmath26 transitions . to observe both transitions simultaneously , we used bichromatic radiation with one of the beams being frequency - shifted by an auxiliary aom-3 for 600  mhz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sasetup ] ) . a typical scan for both @xmath22 and @xmath26 transitions with 14  mhz separation",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "the left resonance is formed by unshifted laser beam and the right is by frequency - shifted one .",
    "the crossover resonance at the picture is a feature of the saturated absorption method that results from the interaction of atoms with both beams  @xcite .",

    "this corresponds to saturation parameter @xmath31 , where    @xmath32    is the transition saturation intensity .",
    "the extinction coefficient was about 30% for both beams .",

    "is described in the next sec .",
    "[ sec : fittingandresults ] .",
    "frequency modulation in nonlinear spectroscopy may result in complicated line shapes of the observed transitions .",
    "a number of analytical results describing line shapes in some specific experimental conditions are presented in  @xcite . in the current setup we used low modulation frequency @xmath33 and small modulation index @xmath34 , that allows to describe the observed signals in terms of a steady - state absorption function @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "if the phase of the laser beam is modulated @xmath36 the absorption will adiabatically follow the instantaneous laser frequency , producing the signal @xmath37",
    "@xmath38    the regime of low frequency modulation allows for the straightforward interpretation of the observed signals in a wide range of experimental conditions .",
    "in particular , the eq .",
    "[ eq : adfmresp ] imposes no limitations to the laser power , total energy absorption or the details of nonlinear interaction .",
    "moreover , the various mechanisms of line broadening are naturally taken into account by eq .",
    "[ eq : adfmresp ] , in contrast to more sophisticated models of refs .",
    "@xcite .    to describe the experimental signal we chose @xmath35 to be the lorenzian function with the same width for all three resonances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] ) .",
    "this choice is justified by the fact that the observed spectral linewidths are only about 30% larger than their natural linewidths .",
    "a number of effects may lead to shift and broadening of resonances in satureted - absorption spectorscopy .",
    "these effects may introduce error in measurements and have to be carefully analyzed .",
    "below we discuss the shift and broadening mechanisms that took place in our experiment and estimate associated uncertainties in hfs measurement .      in saturated absorption",
    "spectroscopy the detected signal rapidly decreases as the pump and probe intensities go below the saturation intensity @xmath39 .",
    "operation at high laser intensities , however , results in power broadening of the observed resonances . in the case of atomic transitions between levels with angular moments @xmath10 and @xmath40 the power - broadened linewidth @xmath41 may be calculated as @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the laser beam intensity and @xmath44 is a numerical factor . in a well - known case of two - level system @xmath45 . however , as showed our numerical calculations based on direct bloch equations solution , for cyclic atomic transitions @xmath46 with @xmath47 in linearly polarized light @xmath44 approaches 0.5 .",
    "the origin of the reducing factor @xmath44 is best illustrated in the case of atom interacting with a linearly polarized laser beam and the quantization axis being directed along the light polarization  @xcite .",
    "for the multilevel atom every upper magnetic sublevel is populated only by absorption from the ground sublevel with the same magnetic number , @xmath48 .",
    "absorption rate @xmath49 is reduced compared to these of two - level atom by the corresponding clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath50 @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the saturation parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the populations of the lower and upper magnetic components . if we consider a particular case of @xmath56 transition , we will find the only relevant coefficient @xmath57 and will reproduce the result for a two - level system @xmath58 with @xmath44 being 1 .",
    "however for transitions between levels with higher @xmath10 the situation is different . in this case @xmath59 and larger light intensity is needed in order to make the stimulated transition rates comparable with the spontaneous decay rates .    in the case of our experiment",
    "the power broadened linewidth is calculated to be 380  khz at @xmath60 .",
    "we note , that intensity here is the single - beam intensity , since at moderate powers the width of the saturated - absorption resonances is the average of the power - broadened widths corresponding to the pump and the probe intensities  @xcite .",

    "this resulted in additional broadening of 7  khz .",
    "deviation of the pump and probe beams from counter - propagating plane waves generally results in shift and broadening of saturated - absorption resonances .",
    "the finite absolute curvatures of the wavefronts and slight misalignment of beams may lead to residual doppler broadening ( so called `` geometrical broadening '' ) .",
    "in particular , the pump and probe beams misalignment ( b.m . ) of finite angle @xmath63 leads to the gaussian broadening of  @xcite @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the light wavevector and @xmath66 is the doppler velocity of atoms . for our setup @xmath67",
    "m / s and the beams misalignment was estimated to be @xmath68  rad that corresponds to the broadening of about @xmath69  khz .    in our experiment",
    "the time of flight of atoms through the laser beams is much longer than the inversed natural linewidth . in this case",
    "the broadening caused by the wavefront curvature ( w.c . ) of the gaussian beam also has essentially the same geometrical origin and may be estimated as  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the rayleigh length , assumed to be the same for pump and probe beams . for",

    "[ eq : rsatabslineph ] predicts signals almost indistinguishable from @xmath78 , but with a slightly larger effective line width . for our conditions we found the line broadening to be about 10  khz .",
    "we note , that at finite modulation frequency also an in - quadrature signal presents @xmath79\\cos(\\omega_m t).\\ ] ] the small admixture of quadrature component results in a slight variation in the detected line width and line shape with the demodulation signal phase change . for the present experiment , however , the effect of quadrature component is of the same negligible order ( @xmath80  khz ) as the correction to the in - phase component by eq .",
    "[ eq : rsatabslineph ] .",
    "resonance broadening by modulation is not accompanied by shift , and thus introduce error only via statistical uncertainty in determining the peak positions .      in order to reduce the influence of magnetic field",
    "the vapor cell was enclosed into a magnetic shield .",
    "in addition , the zeeman splitting was greatly suppressed by similar lande @xmath81-factors of the lower and the upper transition levels ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "conservative estimate of the zeeman shift is less then 10  khz .",
    "we made an upper estimate of the collisional effects by measuring the positions of atomic resonances at different vapor temperatures 640730  c ( corresponding vapor pressure range @xmath83@xmath84  mbar ) .",
    "no collisional broadening was observed at the level of 100 mhz / mbar and no collisional shift was detected with uncertainty 50 mhz / mbar .",
    "thus , the contribution of collisional effects into the line width was below 40 khz and the contribution into the hfs measurement error was below 20 khz .    the photon recoil effect @xcite was @xmath85  khz .",
    "ll source & uncertainty , khz + statistics & 20 + wavefront curvature & 150 + zeeman splitting & @xmath86 + collisional shift & @xmath87 + ule cavity drift & @xmath88 + total uncertainty & 160  khz +      the results for the line broadening and the hfs measurement uncertainty are summarized in tab .",

    "the natural linewidth of the transition was consistently reported in a few works , the most recent result being @xmath12  khz  @xcite . from our experimental data",
    "fit we extracted the observed line width of @xmath89  khz , which provides a reasonable agreement between the estimated and observed broadened lines .",
    "we estimated the error in the hfs measurement as root sum square of the contributions listed in the tab .",
    "[ tab : errbudget ] .",
    "it can be seen that the net uncertainty of 160  khz was dominated by the shifts of resonances due to wavefront curvature , while the statistical error did not exceed 20  khz .",
    "another source of uncertainty was a long - term drift of fabri - perot cavity used for laser frequency stabilization .",
    "typical drift rate was 1.3  khz / s yielding 30  khz shift for the time of measurement .",
    "an independent method to assess the measurement error was provided by the crossover resonance position .",
    "comparison of the measured crossover resonance frequency and its expected value relative to the transitions peaks @xmath90 resulted in the discrepancy of 100  khz , which is consistent with the error estimate given in the tab .",

    "[ eq : ajdef ] ) @xmath94    the latter result is consistent with the value , previously reported by kuhl  @xcite , but is 20 times more accurate .",
    "we reported the measurement of the hyperfine structure of @xmath0 @xmath1 level in thulium atom , which is used for second - stage laser cooling .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of the level was previously measured within uncertainty of 3  mhz using interferometery in atomic beam  @xcite .",
    "the result of our measurement agrees with the previous result , but the accuracy is improved more than an order in magnitude . the reported in  @xcite value of hfs constant @xmath7 agreed with theoretical calculations presented in  @xcite within the measurement uncertainty , and thus our new value may provide a better error estimate for theoretical calculations .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in or measurement was the frequency shift of saturated - absorption resonances due to the wavefront curvature .",
    "we also estimated contributions of other line shift and broadening mechanisms , in particular , line broadening due to frequency - modulation and power broadening in the case of transition between degenerate atomic levels .",
    "the total estimated broadening agrees with the experimental observation .",
    "this work was supported by rfbr grants 15 - 02 - 05324a , 15 - 02 - 03936a and the program of fundamental researches of the ras `` extreme light fields and its applications '' .",
    "in linear spectroscopy the intensities of transitions between hyperfine components of two levels are given by their line strengths @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 denotes the upper and lower levels of the transition . using this relation the transitions between different hyperfine components may be readily identified in experiment . however , in saturated - absorption experiments the relation  ( [ linestrength6j ] ) may yield qualitatively wrong results .",
    "our experiment provides an example when the observed most intense line is not the one expected from eq .",
