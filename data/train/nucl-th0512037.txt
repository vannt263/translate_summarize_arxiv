    "for the first time the knc @xmath1 has been investigated by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite within a non  relativistic potential model approach @xcite .",
    "they have predicted the following parameters of the knc @xmath1 : 1 ) the binding energy @xmath13 , 2 ) the width @xmath14 of the non  pionic two  body decays @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and 3 ) the total width @xmath18 by including the open pionic channels @xcite .",

    "the main aim of this paper is to formulate a phenomenological model for the knc @xmath1 enabling to explain the experimental data by the finuda collaboration @xcite . for this",
    "we use the phenomenological approach for the description of kaonic atoms and strong low  energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 interactions , which has been recently developed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "following the analysis of the energy level shift and width of the ground state of kaonic deuterium @xcite , we adduce the general formulas for the binding energy and the width of the knc @xmath1 . in section 3",
