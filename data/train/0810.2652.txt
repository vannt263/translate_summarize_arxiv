    "if we have the following observations for a solar - type star : a set of p - mode frequencies , measured abundances , and an identified g mode , we can investigate how these observations may constrain some of the physical processes occuring in the interior of a star .",
    "suppose that the stellar model is a main sequence 1 m@xmath0 star , and that we can calibrate the age of the star using the radius and luminosity .",
    "then the _ free _ parameters that remain to be fitted in the star are the initial mass fractions of hydrogen and metals @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the velocities of diffusion of these elements @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , ( assuming that other microscopic processes may not be `` observable '' ) , where @xmath6 denotes helium .",
    "let s denote these set of parameters as * p*. using * p * we can calculate a stellar model which will give us the _ expected observables _ , * b * ( expected p - mode frequencies , abundances etc . ) .",
    "if we have a set of observations * o * , then in order to find the * p * that most adequately reproduce * o * , we can use the following equation iteratively , until we make * o * as close as possible to * b * : @xmath7 @xmath8*p * are the parameter corrections to make to the initial guess * p@xmath9 * , @xmath10 are the measurement errors , and * uwv@xmath11 * is the singular value decomposition of the sensitivity matrix , which can be written as @xmath12 and @xmath13 has some zero values to stabilize the inversion ( see @xcite ) . once * p * have been found , then the theoretical uncertainties @xmath14(*p * ) can be calculated for each @xmath15 parameter @xmath16 the partial derivatives were calculated using the cesam code _",
    "code devolution stellaire adaptatif et modulaire _ @xcite and adipls @xcite .",
    "we took the standard solar model as a reference using the abundances of @xcite , and calibrated these models in radius and luminosity to an accuracy of @xmath17 as described in @xcite .",
    "the reference parameters for the models are @xmath18 and @xmath19 cm s@xmath20 .",
    "using only p - mode frequencies to determine the parameter uncertainties ( using eq .  [ eqn : one ] ) the diffusion coefficients @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can not be disentangled .",
    "their uncertainties remain too large ( 189% , 217% and 422% respectively ) when we assume that we have _ only _ these observations with errors of the order of 1.3@xmath21hz , meanwhile the values for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are 3% and 24% .",
    "however , to show the effect that each of the observations has on the determination of the parameters , figure 1 shows how the uncertainties in each of the parameters reduce relative to these values , as extra observables such as abundances and g modes are included .",
    "each of the bars represents from left to right the following additions to the set of observations :    * _ blue _ reduce the errors on the p - mode frequencies by almost a factor of 2 ( from 1.3 @xmath21hz  0.7@xmath21hz ) * _ green _ include abundance measurements of he , c , n and o * _ yellow _ include abundance measurements of li and be ( @xmath10 = 0.1 dex for all abundances ) * _ red _ include 1 identified g mode    after including all of these observations , the final parameter uncertainties are : 1% , 6% , 28% , 57% and 72% respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note the various effects of adding in new observables .",
    "firstly , reducing all of the uncertainties by almost a factor of 2 should result in a corresponding reduction in the uncertainties by this same amount .",
    "the blue bars clearly indicate that this is the case .",
    "when we include the abundance measurements of he , c , n , o with an observational error of 0.1 dex , the uncertainties in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 reduce by almost a factor of two ( green ) .",
    "these same abundances have little effect for constraining the diffusion velocities .",
    "however , including be and li measurements has a significant impact on the determination of the metal diffusion velocity @xmath5 ( yellow ) , reducing its uncertainty to 72% ( @xmath2420% of its original value ) . finally , the inclusion of one identified g mode has most impact on constraining @xmath3 and then @xmath4 ( red )",
    ".      the final uncertainties may be sufficiently low that the observations do contain enough information to be able to distinguish safely between initial metal mass fraction @xmath2 and diffusion of this @xmath5 ( our original scientific question ) .",
    "assume that we have two new sets of observations , and that these * o * really come from a solar model with 1 ) lower @xmath2 and 2 ) lower @xmath5 .",
    "if we use eq .",
    "[ eqn : dp ] to fit the new * o * ( separately ) while using the reference set of parameters as * p@xmath9 * ( the initial guess ) , we will obtain non - zero negative values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , _ only if _ the observations contain sufficient information . if there is not enough information contained in the observations , then @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the values of @xmath8p ( relative to the original value of * p * , for scaling purposes ) for some of the parameters of the models , when attempting to fit a set of observations generated from a model with a reduced @xmath2 ( red ) and a reduced @xmath5 ( blue ) . as the figure shows , some non - zero @xmath8p are needed to account for the new observations .",
    "* when inverting using the lower @xmath2 model observations ( red ) , @xmath25 is negative .",
    "this means that we need to reduce the original @xmath2 value to a lower one  consistent with the input model .",
    "however , we also see a negative contribution to @xmath5 ; ideally @xmath5 would not change , because it was not changed in this model , just as @xmath1 does not change . * when inverting using the lower @xmath5 model observations ( blue )",
    ", we obtain a much more negative @xmath26 ( but no change in @xmath2 ) , indicating a necessary downward revision of only @xmath5  consistent with the input model .",
    "these results are preliminary , but encouraging : there is some indication in the set of observables that we may be able to distinguish between initial metal abundance and diffusion of this using abundance measurements and seismic data .",
