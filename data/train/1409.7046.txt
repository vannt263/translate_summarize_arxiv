    "let @xmath176 be an injective simplicial map .",
    "the proof consists of several steps :      we first explain how the map @xmath39 induces a map @xmath177 between the corresponding arc graphs . here",
    ", the arc graph of a surface @xmath178 is the simplicial graph @xmath179 whose vertices are arcs on @xmath178 , and where two arcs are adjacent in @xmath179 if and only if they have disjoint interiors .",
    "let @xmath180 and consider @xmath181 . since @xmath182 and @xmath183 , theorem [ invariant - arc ] applied to @xmath184 implies that there exists a unique arc @xmath55 on @xmath2 such that @xmath185 .",
    "we set @xmath186 we state the next observation as a lemma , as we will need to make use of it later . in what follows",
    ", @xmath187 denotes geometric intersection number between arcs .",
    "part ( 1 ) is an immediate consequence of the construction of @xmath188 . for part ( 2 )",
    ", one may first extend @xmath49 and @xmath81 to a triangulation of @xmath2 and then apply ( 1 ) . finally , to see ( 3 ) note that there exist adjacent vertices @xmath198 such that @xmath48 and @xmath199 .",
    "since @xmath200 and @xmath201 are also adjacent , the result now follows from ( 1 ) .        indeed ,",
    "once proposition [ arcs ] has been established , theorem [ isom ] will follow as a combination of lemma [ l:3 ] ( 1 ) and theorem a of disarlo @xcite , which states that two arc graphs are isomorphic if and only if the underlying surfaces are homeomorphic ; we remark that this result is originally due to irmak - mccarthy @xcite in the particular case when @xmath203 and @xmath204 .          before proving lemma [ nonflip ] , observe that if two arcs @xmath206 are edges of the same triangle of a triangulation @xmath50 , then @xmath207 and @xmath208 are edges of the same triangle on @xmath14 . to see this , note that two arcs @xmath206 are edges of the same triangle if and only if there exists an arc @xmath209 such that @xmath210 and @xmath211 for all @xmath212 .",
    "the desired conclusion now follows from parts ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of lemma [ l:3 ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath188 induces a map from the set triangles determined by @xmath50 to the set of triangles determined by @xmath200 .",
    "moreover , if two triangles share a given arc @xmath213 , then their images under @xmath188 share the arc @xmath207 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a triangulation , and suppose @xmath48 is unflippable , so @xmath50 contains the arcs @xmath49 and @xmath55 depicted in figure [ f : nonflip ] , as we draw again in figure [ f : nonflip2 ] .",
    "extend @xmath49 and @xmath55 to a triangulation @xmath52 that contains the solid arcs in figure [ f : nonflip2 ] .",
    "consider the triangulation @xmath214 obtained from @xmath52 by flipping @xmath55 to the arc @xmath215 of figure [ f : nonflip2 ] ; as such , @xmath214 determines two triangles @xmath216 and @xmath217 that share exactly two arcs , namely @xmath49 and @xmath215 .    by the preceding paragraphs and by lemma [ l:3 ] , the triangles @xmath218 and @xmath219 share exactly two arcs , namely @xmath207 and @xmath220 .",
    "lemma [ l:3 ] implies that @xmath188 preserves the property of having intersection number 0 ( resp .",

    ", @xmath225 bounds a once punctured disk on @xmath14 whose interior contains the interior of @xmath207 ; in other words , @xmath207 is unflippable with respect to @xmath201 , and hence is unflippable with respect to @xmath200 .            to prove that",
    "@xmath39 is surjective , let @xmath229 . by the connectivity of @xmath10",
    ", we may assume that @xmath75 is adjacent to @xmath200 , for some @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath227 , we have that @xmath230 for some @xmath52 adjacent to @xmath50 , as desired .      first ,",
    "since @xmath39 is surjective , part ( 1 ) of lemma [ l:3 ] implies that @xmath188 is surjective as well .",
    "we claim that @xmath188 is also injective .",
    "let @xmath231 with @xmath232 . if @xmath233 then @xmath207 and @xmath225 are distinct and disjoint , again by lemma [ l:3 ] ( 1 ) , and hence we are done .",
    "thus assume @xmath234 ; equivalently , @xmath235 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath39 is an isomorphism , we obtain @xmath236 and thus @xmath237 , which is what we set out to prove .",

    "in other words , @xmath35 ; recall that @xmath36 denotes the subgraph of @xmath29 spanned by those triangulations of @xmath14 that contain @xmath19 .",
    "now , @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the surface obtained from @xmath14 by cutting open along every element of @xmath19 ; note that @xmath240 .",
    "the surface @xmath239 need not be connected ; let @xmath241 be its connected components .",
    "by slight abuse of notation , the map @xmath39 induces a map @xmath242 write @xmath243 for the projection onto the @xmath244-th factor .",
    "using the same notation as in the previous section , let @xmath247 be the map on arcs graphs induced by @xmath39 , and choose @xmath213 .",
    "up to reordering indices , we may assume that @xmath248 .",
    "we claim that if @xmath249 satisfies @xmath233 , then @xmath250 as well .",
    "indeed , it suffices choose a third arc @xmath89 such that @xmath251 , so that @xmath252 by lemma [ l:3 ] .",
    "the claim now follows from since @xmath253 is connected .    in the light of the claim above",
    ", we may view @xmath39 ( again abusing notation ) as a map @xmath254 noting that @xmath255 .",
    "since @xmath2 is not exceptional and connected , it follows that @xmath39 is induced by a homeomorphism @xmath256 by theorem [ isom ] .",
