    "in a former paper ( kovcs & walker 1999 , hereafter kw99 ) we have shown that the distances derived from double - mode rr  lyrae ( rrd ) stars are systematically larger than the ones obtained from the standard baade - wesselink ( bw ) analyses of rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the latter distances are in similar conflict also with the bw results of cepheids ( e.g. , gieren et al .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is still unknown ( cacciari et al .",
    "this contributes further to the ambiguity at the @xmath6@xmath7  mag level over the luminosity scale of the rr  lyrae stars , and consequently , over the distances to the nearest globular clusters and galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study the applicability of double - mode variables in the distance calibration in more detail .",
    "the discovery of a large sample of fundamental & first overtone ( fu / fo ) and first & second overtone ( fo / so ) cepheids in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by the ogle team ( udalski et al .",
    "1999a , hereafter u99 ) enables us to derive the distance to the cloud and thereby adding another piece of information to the dispute over the distance of the magellanic clouds .",
    "double - mode ( or beat ) cepheids in the smc have been discovered previously by the major microlensing projects ( macho , alcock et al .  1997 ; eros , beaulieu et al .",
    "however , it is only the ogle team who publishes the data in standard colors ( i.e. , in johnson @xmath8 and in kron - cousins @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , for the time being , we decided to employ their data only .",
    "we use the periods , average @xmath10 colors and @xmath8 magnitudes of the 23 fu / fo and 70 fo / so cepheids published by u99 .",
    "although they presented also @xmath11 colors , we decided not to use them , because of the few data points in @xmath12 . for reddening we accepted their values derived for the various fields from a method based on red clump stars ( see u99 and the _ ftp _ site mentioned above ) .",
    "in computing the distance modulus , we follow almost entirely the method of kw99 . here",
    "we repeat only the basic steps and assumptions .    for any double - mode variable , from the pulsation models we obtain relations between the physical parameters and the periods @xmath13 where @xmath14 or @xmath15 for the fu / fo and fo / so variables , respectively .",
    "the other parameters have their usual meaning . in principle , from the observed color we can determine @xmath16 and from other information we also have approximate values for the hydrogen and metal abundances .",
    "therefore , we can invert the above relations to compute the luminosity ( and mass ) . next ,",
    "the distance modulus @xmath0 is computed simply from the comparison of the observed @xmath8 magnitude and the calculated absolute magnitude from @xmath17 by using a bolometric correction ( @xmath18 ) formula and proper interstellar reddening .",
    "the existence of the two types of beat cepheids in smc enables us to estimate @xmath0 in two different ways . because of the different dependence of the periods on the physical parameters in the two types of variables",
    ", this will allow us to calculate @xmath0 in an optimum way and put constraints on @xmath19 , one of the most important parameters entering in this method .",
    "the other crucial parameter is the _ zero point _ of @xmath16 , which can not be constrained from the present data , but , in principle , it is also possible to do .",
    "the main assumptions entering in our approach are the following :    * fu / fo and fo / so variables have the same chemical composition . *",
    "linear nonadiabatic and purely radiative pulsation model periods are applicable to the observed periods . * the smc has small spatial extent relative to its distance . * current color ",
    "temperature calibrations are reliable enough .",
    "as regards the technical details , it should be mentioned that we used the same standard , purely radiative linear pulsation code as in kw99 .",
    "a large number of models were computed with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and using opal96 opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) .",
    "the distribution of the various elements in @xmath19 corresponds to that of the sun . unlike in the case of rrd models",
    ", we could not find a simple way to invert eq .",
    "therefore , in finding the values of @xmath26 which fit the observed periods the best for the given @xmath16 , @xmath27 and @xmath19 , we used a straightforward search in the interpolated fine grid of the original model sequences .",
    "as far as the @xmath28 and @xmath18 calibrations are concerned , we used the stellar atmosphere models of castelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and obtained the following formulae through least squares fits in a parameter space relevant for beat cepheids ( i.e. , @xmath29k , @xmath30 , @xmath31}=-1.5 - 0.0 $ ] ) @xmath32 } \\hskip 2 mm , \\\\",

    "the above @xmath18 is adjusted to @xmath36 and yields @xmath37 .",
    "the zero point of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is only marginally higher than that of blackwell & lynas - gray ( 1994 , hereafter blg94 ) ( see also clementini et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is based on the infrared flux method ( irfm ) .",
    "other , more recent irfm - based @xmath16 calibrations ( blackwell & lynas - gray 1998 , hereafter blg98 ; alonso et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter a99 ) yield lower zero points ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "we caution however , that these differences are based on @xmath28 calibrations , and the corresponding formula of a99 can be employed only after applying a transformation from their johnson @xmath40 to @xmath9 ( fernie 1983 ) .",
    "this could perhaps be one of the reasons why we get ( somewhat curiously ) better agreement between blg94 and a99 with the temperatures calibrated by @xmath11 . in the next section",
    "we will check the sensitivity of the derived distance modulus against the various @xmath16 scales .",
    "finally we note that for the calculation of the gravity we used the following formula @xmath41 which has been derived from a simple pulsation equation and black - body relation .",
    "this formula has a maximum error of @xmath42 , assuming that @xmath43 .",
    "to characterize the quality of the fit , for each variable , we calculated the following quantity @xmath44 where @xmath45 or @xmath46 for the fu / fo and fo / so variables , respectively . the difference between the observed and calculated periods are denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "we found basic difference between the two types of variables in respect of the behavior of @xmath48 . in figs .  1 and 2 we show representative gray maps and one dimensional slices along the minimum values of @xmath49 .",
    "for better visibility , in the gray maps we used a relatively low resolution , and therefore we considered only the minimum value of @xmath49 in each pixel ( the scans were performed on a much finer grid ) .",
    "we see that the minimum ( indicated by the black pixels ) is much more pronounced for the fu / fo than for the fo / so variables .",
    "this is nicely seen also in the slices along the minimum values .",
    "in addition , there is also a slight offset of @xmath50 for @xmath51 between the observed and theoretical values .",
    "although this problem might bear some theoretical significance , it is completely unimportant in the present context ( see table 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the shallow minima of the fo / so variables yielded more stable @xmath0s , depending ( much ) less on the various parameter changes than those of the fu / fo variables .",
    "this , together with their large number , make them very valuable for the purpose of distance estimation .",
    "-0 mm    -0 mm    -0 mm    -0 mm    the calculation of the distance modulus was performed for each @xmath19 listed in the previous section . by applying the temperature scale given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the individual @xmath0s are plotted in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "we employed the @xmath4 criterion for filtering out a few outliers ( the number of these variables never exceeded two ) .",
    "the most striking feature of these plots is the large sensitivity of @xmath52 ( @xmath0 of the fu / fo variables ) against the variation of @xmath19 .",
    "this is in contrast with the very _ weak sensitivity _ of @xmath53 .",
    "these properties and the @xmath54 condition allow us an optimum estimation of @xmath19 .",
    "( we note in passing that the other natural criterion , minimum dispersion of all individual distance moduli , leads to the same conclusion . ) as it is seen in fig .  4",
    ", the present results prefer a somewhat lower abundance than the one most often used in the context of the smc cepheids . with @xmath35 ,",
    "our close to optimum @xmath19 corresponds to [ fe / h]@xmath55 , whereas the usually quoted value is @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath57 , see luck et al .",
    "we think that this is a fair agreement and a good sign of the consistency between the present , completely independent estimation of @xmath19 and those obtained by direct spectroscopic observations ( of other cepheid variables ) .    -0 mm    -5 mm    -0 mm    -5 mm    although fig .",
    "4 shows that the exact @xmath54 condition is still not satisfied for @xmath58 , and a somewhat lower @xmath19 would be more appropriate , the difference is within the reasonable error limit , and therefore , in the estimation of @xmath0 , we use the result obtained at @xmath58 .",
    "when weighted by the number of stars , we get @xmath59  mag for the average rounded distance modulus . by using the lower @xmath16 scale of a99 , a similar match is found at @xmath58 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case",
    "we get @xmath60  mag . due to the large number of variables ,",
    "the formal statistical errors are very small in both cases : @xmath61  mag .",
    "much more significant sources of errors are the various systematic effects and zero point ambiguities .",
    "table 1 summarizes the changes in the distance moduli caused by the most significant potential sources of these kinds of errors .",

    "it is difficult to assess the size of the systematic errors in the various quantities .",
    "the numbers entering in the table are our best guesses on the @xmath4 errors ( for notation simplicity we used positive changes everywhere ) .",
    "the assumed ambiguity in @xmath16 is based on the difference between a99 and blg94 .",
    "we think that this is a generous overestimation of the true error , because of the ambiguities mentioned in sect .  2 and because of the smaller difference obtained in a comparison with the other current scale of blg98 ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from the table :    * fu / fo variables are ( much ) more sensitive to the systematic changes than fo / so variables . *",
    "the most serious source of error is the zero point ambiguity in the @xmath16 scale . *",
    "considering only the fo / so variables , which dominate the value of the average distance modulus , and assuming that the various errors are independent , we get @xmath89  mag for the total estimated systematic error .",
    "by using the relative distance of @xmath90  mag determined by udalski et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , the present determination of the smc distance leads to an lmc distance modulus of @xmath91  mag .",
    "this value is magically close to the value of @xmath92  mag , derived from the application of the same method to galactic double - mode rr  lyrae stars and using the relative distance of a few lmc globular clusters ( kovcs 2000 ) . considering that this result was derived on a completely different data set",
    ", we think that the agreement is remarkable .",
    "this result suggest that the present models and input physics are more compatible with the observations than implied by buchler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from their beat and bump cepheid studies .",
    "as given in table 1 , the most important source of ambiguity in this method is the potential error in the zero point of the temperature scale . even if we consider this ambiguity , it is not possible to lower the distance modulus by more than @xmath93  mag .",
    "this emphasizes further the contradiction between this ` long ' and other ` short ' distances , obtained e.g. , by statistical parallax and red clump methods ( udalski et al .",
    "1999b , see however romaniello et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
