    "the radioactive @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopes decay into their daughter stable nuclei with lifetimes of the order of a few @xmath3 yr .",
    "these times are short enough , compared to the typical timescales of galaxy evolution , that the observations of these isotopes clearly identify the locus of the present nuclesynthetic enrichment through the galaxy .",
    "observations of the @xmath4 emission from the radioactive @xmath0 at 1.809 mev have been reported by several missions over the last 15 years and show that @xmath0 is mostly confined in the disk of the galaxy with some prominent areas of emission corresponding to the vela and cygnus regions ( diehl & timmes 1998 ) .",
    "many sources can be responsible for the production of @xmath0 in the galaxy , among them core collapse supernovae , wr stars , novae and agb stars .",
    "unfortunately the observations do not provide a strong constraint on the dominant source of production yet .",
    "there is another measurable quantity , however , that could help to distinguish between the various competing sources .",
    "in particular @xmath5 from the radioactive @xmath1 may be a good discriminant for the origin of galactic @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , core collapse supernovae should produce comparable amounts of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 while all the other candidates produce a much smaller amount of @xmath1 compared to @xmath0 .",
    "a few years ago we started a series of papers devoted to the study of the presupernova evolution and explosive nucleosynthesis of massive stars , in the range 13 - 35 @xmath2 , as a function of initial mass and metallicity ( chieffi et al .",
    "1998 , limongi et al .",
    "2000 , chieffi & limongi 2004 ) .",
    "no mass loss was included into those computations . at present",
    "we are addressing the presupernova evolution and explosion of massive stars with mass loss in a more extended range of mass , namely between 13 and 120 @xmath2 ( chieffi & limongi in preparation ) . in this paper",
    "we preliminarily discuss the production of @xmath0 and @xmath6 in two selected massive star models , namely a 25 and a 80 @xmath2 , of initial solar metallicity .     and",
    "@xmath1 ( thick solid lines ) for the 25 @xmath2 model before the explosion .",

    "lower panel _ : internal profile of @xmath0 , @xmath1 together with their cumulative values ( thick solid lines ) for the 25 @xmath2 model after the explosion . also in this case the most abundant isotopes are shown .",
    "the y - axis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is not shown and ranges between 0 and @xmath7 . ]",
    "in stars , @xmath0 is produced by proton capture on @xmath8 and destroyed by @xmath9 decay into @xmath10 and by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 reactions ( clayton & leising 1987 ) . in massive stars ( @xmath14 ) @xmath0 can be produced by ( 1 ) hydrostatic h burning , ( 2 ) hydrostatic c and ne burning and ( 3 ) explosive c and ne burning .",
    "any @xmath0 produced by these stars is ejected by both stellar wind and explosion in different proportions depending on the initial mass .",
    "@xmath1 is produced by the sequence @xmath15 .",
    "this sequence is mainly powered by the @xmath16 reaction , that is efficient during ( 1 ) hydrostatic he burning , ( 2 ) hydrostatic c burning and ( 3 ) explosive ne burning .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in two massive star models , namely a 25 and a 80 @xmath2 , of initial solar metallicity .",
    "these models have been computed with the latest version of the franec code ( chieffi & limongi 2004 ) .",
    "mass loss have been included following the prescriptions of ( 1 ) vink et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) for the blue supergiant phase ( @xmath17 ) , ( 2 ) de jager et al . ( 1988 ) for the red supergiant phase ( @xmath18 ) and ( 3 ) nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) during the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "the explosion has been computed adopting a ppm hydro code in the framework of the piston method .",
    "the initial velocity of the piston is set in order to eject all the matter above the iron core . as a consequence",
    "the final kinetic energy is different depending on the progenitor mass .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the internal profiles of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the 25 and a 80 @xmath2 models respectively .",
    "the upper panels refer to the pre explosive abundances while the lower panels refer to the final explosive ones .     model .",
    "the y - axis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the lower panel is not shown and ranges between 0 and @xmath19 . ]    in the 25 @xmath2 star the bulk of @xmath0 is produced by the ne shell during the presupernova evolution ; then it is completely destroyed by the explosion and reproduced , farther out in mass , by the explosive ne and c burning . hence , in this case , the final yield of @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis . on the contrary",
    "the @xmath1 produced by the c convective shell during the presupernova evolution is only marginally affected by the explosive ne and c burning .",
    "hence the total final yield of @xmath1 ( @xmath21 ) is due , by more than 70% , to its hydrostatic production .",
    "let us eventually note that no @xmath1 is synthesized in a sizeable amount within the he convective shell .    in the 80 @xmath2 star the production of @xmath0 is more complicated than in the 25 @xmath2 .",
    "indeed @xmath0 is initially produced during the presupernova evolution by the central h burning .",
    "roughly half of this @xmath22 is lost by stellar winds during the wolf - rayet phase , while the remaining is burnt during the following he burning .",
    "another episode of @xmath22 production occurs during the subsequent c and ne shell burning phases so that the final profile of @xmath0 , that is present within the star at the moment of the explosion , is shown in the upper panel of figure 2 .",
    "the effect of the explosion is to completely destroy the @xmath0 produced by the hydrostatic ne burning shell and to reproduce it farther out in mass . the final total yield of @xmath0 ( @xmath23 ) is due to the sum of the @xmath0 present in the stellar wind ( @xmath24 ) , the one that survived the explosive nucleosynthesis ( @xmath25 ) and the one due to the explosive burning ( @xmath26 ) . at variance with the 25 @xmath2 model , the he convective shell dominates the final nucleosynthesis of @xmath1",
    "( see the upper panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "such an occurrence is due to the fact that , in this case , the he convective shell is exposed to a temperature high enough that the @xmath16 reaction becomes extremely efficient .",
    "such a high temperature obviously induces also a large he consumption ( @xmath27 in mass fraction ) within the he convective shell .",
    "the final total yield of @xmath1 ( @xmath28 ) is due to the sum of the @xmath1 produced by the he convective shell ( @xmath29 ) , the one produced by the c convective shell ( @xmath30 ) and the one produced by explosive ne and c burning ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "no @xmath1 is present within the stellar wind .",
    "we have discussed the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in two massive star models , namely a 25 and a 80 @xmath2 , of initial solar metallicity .",
    "we have shown that in the 25 @xmath2 model , the final yield of @xmath0 is dominated by explosive c and ne burning while @xmath1 mainly comes from the convective c shell ( @xmath32 ) and to a lesser extent ( @xmath33 ) by explosive c and ne burning .",
    "on the contrary , in the 80 @xmath2 model @xmath0 comes from : stellar wind ( @xmath34 ) , convective c shell ( @xmath35 ) and explosive c and ne burning ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the final yield of @xmath1 is dominated by the he convective shell by more than 85% .",
    "no @xmath1 is present in the stellar wind .",
    "we explored the dependence of the final @xmath0 yield on the explosion energy and we found that it remains essentially constant up to , at least , final kinetic energies of the order of a few foes .    as a final comment",
    "let us note that the @xmath37 ratio is 0.68 and 1.77 for the 25 and the 80 @xmath2 models respectively .",
    "these ratios are both well above the upper limit ( @xmath38 ) reported by the @xmath39-ray instruments presently in space . a detailed discussion of the theoretical steady state @xmath37 prediction , in the light of the present uncertainties in the computation of the stellar models ,",
    "will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
