    "the decay channel of the higgs boson to two photons is one of the most important channels for the higgs searches at the lhc .",
    "the current measurements report on the following values of the signal strength : @xmath3 ( atlas )  @xcite , @xmath4 ( cms )  @xcite .",
    "they are both consistent with the sm prediction ( @xmath5 ) , but do not exclude the possibility of deviations due to new physics ( np ) contributions",
    ". for the @xmath6 channel there are still not enough data to draw significant conclusions .",
    "the loop - induced decays of the higgs boson are important for the np searches , because in this type of processes the contributions from the new particles can be comparable to the sm ones . in the inert doublet model ( idm )",
    "the @xmath7 width is not modified with respect to the sm , while the @xmath8 and @xmath6 can receive corrections due to the @xmath9 exchanged in a loop .",
    "also , the invisible higgs decays can modify the signal strengths , augmenting the total width of the higgs boson .",
    "so the @xmath8 channel is a perfect one to reveal some information about the extra scalars present in the idm  @xcite . as the experimental results are not conclusive yet",
    ", we analyze both the case of enhancing and suppressing , as compared to the sm , the two - photon decay rate .",
    "the idm is a two higgs doublet model with the scalar fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 interacting according to the following scalar potential  @xcite @xmath12+\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\lambda_{1}(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})^{2}+\\lambda_{2}(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})^{2}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ * & & + \\lambda_{3}(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})+\\lambda_{4}(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{5}\\left[(\\phi_{s}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{d})^{2}+(\\phi_{d}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{s})^{2}\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all the parameters are real and @xmath13 .",
    "we set the yukawa interactions to type i , i.e. , only the @xmath10 doublet couples to fermions .",
    "the vacuum state is such that only @xmath10 develops a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) :    @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the mass matrix written in terms of the component fields of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is diagonal , so the two doublets do not mix .",
    "the particle spectrum of the idm consists of a sm - like higgs boson @xmath16 which originates from @xmath10 and thus couples to fermions and gauge bosons just like the sm higgs boson , and four so - called dark ( or inert ) scalars which originate from @xmath11 and do not couple to fermions at the tree level .",
    "the masses of the particles read @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the model ( the lagrangian and the vacuum state ) is exactly symmetric under a @xmath19 symmetry , such that : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . due to the @xmath19-parity conservation ,",

    "@xcite to provide a viable dark matter ( dm ) candidate . in this work",
    "we choose @xmath23 to be the lightest among the dark scalars .",
    "the dm particle of mass in three regions agrees with the wmap measurements of the dm relic density ( @xmath24 at @xmath25  @xcite ) : light dm ( @xmath26 ) , intermediate dm ( @xmath27 ) and heavy dm ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the model is in agreement with current experimental and theoretical constraints : positivity of the potential , perturbative unitarity , stability of the inert vacuum , electroweak precision tests and the lep constraints on the scalars masses , see e.g. ref .  @xcite . as @xmath23 is the dm candidate it has to be the lightest of the dark scalars , i.e. @xmath29 , @xmath30",

    "@xmath32 where the narrow width approximation has been used .",
    "moreover , the facts that the main production channel of the higgs boson is the gluon fusion , and that the cross section for this process in the idm is the same as in the sm have been taken into account .",
    "this rate can be modified with respect to the sm prediction ( @xmath5 ) in two ways .",
    "first , the invisible decay channels ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) can augment the total decay width of the higgs boson @xmath35 .",
    "their widths are controlled by the masses of the neutral dark scalars and their couplings to  @xmath16 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "secondly , the charged scalar can be exchanged in loops leading to modification of the partial decay width of the higgs boson to two photons , @xmath38 .",
