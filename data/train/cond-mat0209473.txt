    "in the following we perform a validity test of the formulae ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) when using microscopic model , describing superconducting properties of a system with two hybrydized electronic bands . the cooper - pairs attraction , responsible for the superconducting properties , we choose in the form of the intersite interaction restricted to only one band ( one superconducting order parameter ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model can be written in the form ( great canonical ensemble )              two electronic bands are characterized by the hopping intergrals @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ; @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) . the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 denote the hybridization and intersite cooper - pairs attraction , respectively .",
    "the electronic annihilation ( creation ) operators ( @xmath118 ; @xmath123 ) are denoted by @xmath124 @xmath125 , respectively , where @xmath126 is the lattice site index . for simplicity",
    ", we consider simple cubic ( sc ) lattice . similarly to ref .",
    "[ 26 ] we apply the mean field approximation ( see the third term in ( 55 ) )                            where @xmath140 ( we assume @xmath141 ) is the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter ( @xmath142 - symmetry ) .",
    "looking at the expressions ( 61)-(63 ) and ( 65 ) we see that the only dispression in our system is generated by the formfactor ( 64 ) of the sc lattice .",
    "it means that we can convert @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the true density of states of the sc lattice given by the jelitto formula [ 27 ] .",
    "applying the standard green s function approach ( cf e.g. [ 28 ] ) we can find a set of transcendental equations of the type ( @xmath118 ; @xmath145 )            where @xmath149 is the average number of electrons per lattice site .",
    "the calculations of all necessary quantities to check the formulae ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) are very laborious and lead to very complicated expressions ( to long to present here ) .",
    "therefore we are forced to describe only the general calculation scheme and to present final , numerical results .",
    "the implicit equations ( 66)-(68 ) allow to calculate the temperature dependence of the square amplitude @xmath150 ( it is just the order parameter in the sense of the landau s theory ) and @xmath151 as function of temperature .",
    "the calculation of the specific heat per lattice site @xmath152 can be performed with the use of ( 58 ) when calculating      and differentiating it with respect to @xmath154 .",
    "this differentiation is , however , very laborious because @xmath150 and @xmath151 fulfil the equations ( 66)-(68 ) and are also temperature dependent . in other words",
    ", we have to differentiate them with respect to @xmath154 to calculate the temeprature derivatives of @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( necessary to check the formulae ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath0 ( phase transition from superconducting to normal state ) can be obtained from the equation ( 67 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath0 should fulfil the following equation      the function @xmath156 in ( 70 ) is exactly the same as in the rhs of ( 67 ) but we have additionally assumed that the order parameter is equal to zero ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we should also calculate the derivative @xmath157 .",
    "it can be performed by the differentiation of the equations ( 70 ) , ( 66 ) and ( 68 ) with respect to @xmath158 ( we put @xmath13 therein ( the order parameter is equal to zero ) ) . in such a way we have",
    "all necessary quantities to check the formulae ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) .",
    "these formulae we should first rewrite in the following way ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 @xmath161 ( the second landau s parameter per lattice site ) ) .",
    "thus , we obtain              the results of our calculations are presented in fig .",
    "1 . we see ( fig .",
    "1a , c ) that @xmath165 and the temperature derivative of the chemical potential exhibit jumps at @xmath13 whereas the coefficient @xmath166 is a continuous function at the critical point ( fig .",
    "it results in the jump of the specific heat per lattice site @xmath152 ( fig .",
    "1d ) at @xmath13 .",
    "it would be interseting to know whether the temperature behaviour of the coefficients ( fig.1a , b , c ) in ( 73 ) is a general property of all superconductors ( when write the specific heat in the form ( 73 ) ) or only a property of this particular model .",
    "this question needs a verification from the experimental ( nobody has proved it till now ) and also from the theoretical point of view ( when consider another microscopic models ) . from the other hand , the model we have applied here ,",
    "should qualitatively reproduce all general properties of superconductors .",
    "therefore it is very probably that only coefficient @xmath167 and the temperature derivative of the chemical potential exibit jumps at the critical point whereas the coefficient @xmath168 is a continuous function for these materials .",
    "the plots of the derivatives @xmath169 and @xmath170 are given in fig .",
    "1e and fig .",
    "1f , respectively . calculating the lhs of ( 71 ) and ( 72 ) independently by means of the data displayed in the figs 1c - f we obtain almost the same value of the second landau s parameter per lattice site @xmath171 @xmath172 .",
    "it also means that the formula ( 46 ) is automatically fulfilled ( see fig .",
    "1c , d , e ) .",
    "the general , phenomenological relations ( 16 ) , ( 22 ) and ( 25)-(28 ) together with their analogs ( 40)-(45 ) seem to be very important for superconducting systems in the practice because they connect different macroscopic thermodynamical quantities at the critical point .",
    "they also allowed to obtain interesting cross - relations ( 29)-(36 ) and ( 46)-(53 ) between different critical jumps and the critical temperature derivatives or between the separate jumps . due to a variety of relations",
    "we have a possibility to estimate in an indirect way many of the critical jumps without performing experiments .",
    "such a possibility can especially be interesting in many cases where experiments are difficult to perform and the information gained in this way can be decisive as e.g. the indication for the hole - type superconductivity in the high-@xmath173superconductor @xmath174 ( see refs [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] for details ) .        the derived critical relations ( 29)-(36 ) and ( 46)-(53 ) are also valid for a more general case of superconducting , correlated systems with many order parameters ( multiband systems ) .",
    "as a consequence of electronic correlations the critical temperature @xmath0 is the same for all order parameters ( all of them vanish for @xmath175 ) . to make a proof of the statement that the relations ( 29)-(36 ) and ( 46)-(53 ) are valid in this case we consider the gibbs potential in the form @xmath176 as a generalization of the gibbs potential ( 4 ) after taylor expansion with respect to the order parameters @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath179 , @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) have similar meaning as in the formula ( 4 ) . using the orthogonal transformation @xmath182 the bilinear form in ( n.1 )",
    "can always be diagonalized ( @xmath180 ) and instead of the formulae ( n.1 ) we obtain the following expression ( similar to ( 4 ) ) @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( @xmath178 ) are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath186 .",
    "the quantities @xmath187 ( @xmath178 ) can be treated as `` new '' order parameters because of the reciprocal relation @xmath188 and due to the fact ( see ( n.4 ) ) that @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) vanish at the same critical temperature @xmath0 as the order parameters @xmath177 ( @xmath190 ) . from the minimum principle ( @xmath191 , @xmath190 ) we obtain @xmath192 and this equation can be used to eliminate @xmath185 ( @xmath190 ) from the expression ( n.3 ) .",
    "we obtain in this way very similar expression to ( 9 ) , it is @xmath193 to each @xmath194 and @xmath187 ( @xmath190 ) we apply analogous assumptions to ( 7 ) and ( 8) where the lower index @xmath126 should be added .",
    "repeating the calculations similar to the described above ( see ( 10)-(28 ) ) we obtain analogous expressions to ( 16 ) , ( 22 ) and ( 25)-(28 ) .",
    "these new expressions , however , can easily be obtained from ( 16 ) , ( 22 ) and ( 25)-(28 ) when replace @xmath195 ^ 2 $ ] on the rhs of them by a new quantity @xmath196 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this new quantity is irrelevant when forming the quotients ( see ( 29)-(33 ) ) because it cancels out .",
    "thus , the formulae ( 29)-(33 ) and the resulting cross relations ( 34)-(36 ) remain unchanged .",
    "exactly the same can be said about the formulae ( 46)-(53 ) which remain also the same when apply the procedure described in this section with respect to the helmholtz potential @xmath197 as a generalization of ( 39 ) for the case of superconducting systems with many order parameters ."
