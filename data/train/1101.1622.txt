    "the discovery of extended flat rotation curves in the outer parts of disk galaxies three decades ago ( bosma 1978 ; rubin et  al .",
    "1978 ) was decisive in ushering in the paradigm shift that led to the now standard cosmological model dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the need for dark matter on cosmological scales is also firmly established from observations of the cosmic microwave background , type ia supernovae , weak lensing , and galaxy clustering ( see , e.g. , spergel et  al .",
    "numerical simulations of structure formation within the @xmath9cdm cosmology make firm predictions for the structure and mass function of dark matter haloes in the absence of baryons ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; bullock et  al .",
    "2001 ; macci et  al .  2007 ;",
    "navarro et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it is still unclear , however , whether this standard model can reproduce the observed properties of the universe at galactic and sub - galactic scales .",
    "there are problems related to the inner density profiles of dark matter haloes ( e.g. , de blok et  al .",
    "2001 ; swaters et  al .",
    "2003 ; newman et al .",
    "2009 ) , reproducing the zero point of the tully - fisher relation ( e.g. , mo & mao 2000 ; dutton et  al .",
    "2007 ) , and the amount of small - scale substructure ( e.g. , klypin et  al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; stewart et  al .",
    "there are three classes of solutions to these problems : those that invoke galaxy formation processes that modify the properties of dark matter haloes ; those that change the nature of dark matter itself ; and those in which dark matter does not exist .",
    "thus , measuring the density profiles of the dark matter haloes of galaxies of all types is a stringent test for galaxy formation theories .    from an observational point of view , little is known about the detailed distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of disk galaxies , despite the great investment of telescope time and high quality measurements of hundreds of rotation curves ( e.g. , carignan & freeman 1985 ; begeman 1987 ; courteau 1997 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; verheijen 1997 ; swaters 1999 ; de blok et  al .",
    "2001 ; swaters et  al .",
    "2003 ; blais - ouellette et  al .  2004 ;",
    "simon et  al .  2005 ; noordermeer et  al .",
    "2005 ; simon et  al .",
    "2005 ; chemin et  al .  2006 ; kuzio de naray 2006 ; de blok et  al .",
    "2008 ; dicaire et  al .",
    "2008 ; epinat et  al .",
    "the fundamental reason is the so - called _ disk - halo degeneracy _ :",
    "mass models with either maximal or minimal baryonic components fit the rotation curves equally well , leaving the structure of the dark matter halo poorly constrained by the kinematic data alone ( e.g. , van albada & sancisi 1986 ; van den bosch & swaters 2001 ; dutton et  al .",
    "stellar population models are able to place constraints on stellar mass - to - light ratios , allowing inference about the baryonic contribution to the overall mass profile",
    ". however , there are a number of uncertainties which limit the accuracy of this method ( e.g. , conroy et  al .  2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "these include systematic uncertainties such as the unknown stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and the treatment of the various stellar evolutionary phases in stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models .",
    "these result in about a factor of 2 uncertainty in the stellar masses estimated from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting .",
    "moreover , for a given imf and sps model , there are uncertainties in the star formation histories , metallicities and extinction which introduce ( @xmath12 ) random errors in measurements of stellar masses for individual galaxies at the level of 0.15  dex ( e.g. , bell & de jong 2001 ; auger et  al .",
    "2009 , gallazzi & bell 2009 ) .",
    "nevertheless , galaxy colours and dynamical mass estimates have been used in combination by various authors to place an upper limit on the stellar mass - to - light ratio normalisation , favoring imfs more bottom light than salpeter for spiral galaxies and fast rotating low - mass elliptical galaxies ( bell & de jong 2001 ; cappellari et  al .",
    "2006 ; de jong & bell 2007 ; see , however , treu et al .",
    "2010 , auger et al .",
    "2010 , and van dokkum & conroy 2010 for massive ellipticals ) .",
    "however , as theory generally predicts more dark matter in the inner regions of disk galaxies than is consistent with standard imfs ( dutton et  al .  2007 ; dutton et  al .",
    "2010b ) a lower limit to the stellar mass would provide a more useful constraint for @xmath9cdm .",
    "several other methods have been used to try and measure disk galaxy stellar masses , independent of the uncertainties in the imf .",
    "these include : 1 ) vertical velocity dispersions of low inclination disks ( bottema 1993 ; verheijen et  al .  2007 ;",
    "bershady et  al .  2010 ) , 2 ) bars and spiral structure ( weiner et  al .  2001 ;",
    "kranz et  al .  2003 ) , and 3 ) strong gravitational lensing by inclined disks ( maller et  al .",
    "2000 ; winn et  al .",
    "none of these methods have thus far yielded conclusive results .",
    "an approach combining strong gravitational lensing plus kinematics holds great promise , because it takes advantage of the different geometries of disks and haloes , which results in three effects that enable the disk mass to be measured .",
    "1 ) an inclined disk will present a much higher projected surface density than a face - on disk , with resulting image positions and shapes that depend on the disk mass fraction .",
    "2 ) an edge - on disk is highly elliptical in projection , more than expected for any realistic dark matter halo , with resulting total mass ellipticity depending on the disk mass fraction 3 ) strong lensing measures mass projected along a cylinder ( within the einstein radius ) , whereas stellar kinematics ( rotation and dispersion ) measure mass enclosed within spheres ( see ) . for spherical mass distributions of stars and dark matter ,",
    "the ratio between the projected mass within a cylinder of radius , @xmath13 , and the enclosed mass within a sphere of the same radius , @xmath13 , is _ independent _ of the relative contribution of the two mass components ( left panel ) .",
    "therefore , in order to break the degeneracy one has to assume a radial profile shape for both components ( e.g. , treu & koopmans 2002 , 2004 ; koopmans & treu 2003 ; koopmans et al . 2006 ; treu et al .  2010 ; auger et al . 2010 ) .",
    "typically this involves assuming the baryonic mass follows the light , and then assuming a functional form for the dark matter halo .",
    "however , for a disk plus halo system , this ratio is _ dependent _ on the relative contribution of the two components ( right panel ) . thus if the spherical and cylindrical masses can be measured accurately enough ,",
    "the disk halo degeneracy can be broken without assuming a specific radial profile shape for either component . furthermore ,",
    "strong lensing plus kinematics can place constraints on the 3d shape of the dark matter halo ( e.g. , koopmans , de bruyn , & jackson 1998 ; maller et  al .  2000 ) which is of interest because @xmath9cdm haloes are predicted to be non - spherical ( e.g. allgood et  al .  2006 ; bett et  al .  2007 ;",
    "macci et  al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the power of the strong gravitational lensing method has not yet been fully realised , primarily due to the scarcity of known spiral galaxy gravitational lenses . prior to the slacs survey ( bolton et  al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) only a handful of spiral galaxy lenses with suitable inclinations to enable rotation curve measurements were known : q2237@xmath140305 ( huchra et  al .",
    "1985 ; trott & webster 2002 ) ; b1600@xmath14434 ( jackson et  al .  1995 ; jaunsen & hjorth 1997 ) ; pmnj2004@xmath01349 ( winn et  al .  2003 ) ; cxocyj220132.8@xmath0320144 ( castander et  al .  2006 )",
    ". however , most of these systems are doubly - imaged qsos which provide minimal constraints on the projected mass density .",
    "q2237@xmath140305 is a quadruply - imaged qso , which gives more robust constraints , but since the einstein radius is small compared to the size of the galaxy , the lensing is mostly sensitive to the bulge mass , not the halo ( trott et al . 2010 ; van de ven et al . 2010 ) .    the final slacs lens sample ( auger et  al .",
    "2009 ) is comprised of 98 strong galaxy - galaxy lenses , among these , 16 have been classified morphologically as type s or s0 .",
    "inspired by this , we have extended the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss , york et  al .",
    "2000 ) spectroscopic lens selection technique specifically to spiral galaxy lenses . in the resulting swells survey ( treu et  al .  , in prep , referred to hereafter as paper i ) we have assembled a larger sample of late - type galaxy - scale gravitational lenses for detailed mass modelling . in this paper , the second of the swells series , we present a detailed and self - consistent mass model of the spiral galaxy lens sdssj2141@xmath00001(ra=21:41:54.67 , dec=@xmath000:01:12.2 , j2000 ) , constrained by both kinematic and lensing data .",
    "as we will see , this galaxy is disk - dominated , with a disk inclination of @xmath15 ; this set - up approximately maximises the projected disk mass while allowing an accurate rotation curve to be measured .",
    "the original spectroscopic observations of sdssj2141@xmath00001were obtained on sdss plate  989 , with fiber  35 , on mjd  52468 .",
    "the latest public sdss - dr7 ( abazajian et  al .  2009 ) petrosian magnitudes ( uncorrected for extinction ) for the lens galaxy are @xmath16 with errors @xmath17 . the sdss measured redshift for the lens galaxy is @xmath18 , and the velocity dispersion is @xmath19",
    ". the spectrum also exhibits nebular emission lines at a background redshift of @xmath20 ( bolton et  al .",
    "2008 ) . with these redshifts",
    "the scale in the lens plane is @xmath21 , while in the source plane it is @xmath22 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in we",
    "present the imaging observations of sdssj2141@xmath00001from keck and the hubble space telescope , and then infer the structure of the stellar mass distribution of the galaxy in the presence of its dust from these data in . with this information in hand",
    "we then define a three - component mass model for the galaxy in , and describe how it is constrained by the imaging data ( although we choose not to use the stellar mass inferred from the sed at this stage ) . in ,",
    "we describe the preparation and analysis of the strong lensing data . in",
    "we present the spectroscopic observations of sdssj2141@xmath00001from keck . then in we present fits to the lensing and kinematics data using three combinations : lensing only ; kinematics only ; and lensing plus kinematics .",
    "this joint analysis yields constraints on the stellar mass of the disk and bulge ; returning to the stellar masses inferred from the stellar population modelling of the sed we , discuss implications of our results for the stellar imf in . in & we discuss our results for the density and shape of the dark matter halo .",
    "we conclude in .    throughout , we assume a flat @xmath9cdm cosmology with present day matter density , @xmath23 , and hubble parameter , @xmath24 .",
    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system . unless otherwise stated , all parameter estimates are the median of the marginalised posterior pdf , and their uncertainties are described by the absolute difference between the median and the 84th and 16th percentiles ( such that the error bars enclose 68% of the posterior probability ) .",
