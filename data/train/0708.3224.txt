    "let @xmath1 be positive integers .",
    "it is well - known that every sufficiently large integer can be written as a non - negative integer linear combination of the @xmath3 if and only if @xmath2 .",
    "the _ frobenius problem _ ( so - called because , according to brauer @xcite , `` frobenius mentioned it occasionally in his lectures '' ) is the following :    given positive integers @xmath1 with @xmath2 , find the largest positive integer @xmath4 which _ can not _ be represented as a non - negative integer linear combination of the @xmath3 .    _ the chicken mcnuggets problem _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) . if chicken mcnuggets can be purchased at mcdonald s only in quantities of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 pieces , what is the largest number of mcnuggets that can not be purchased ?",
    "the answer is @xmath8 .",
    "although it seems simple at first glance , the frobenius problem on positive integers has many subtle and intriguing aspects that continue to elicit study . a recent book by ramrez alfonsn @xcite lists over 400 references on this problem .",
    "applications to many different fields exist : to algebra @xcite ; the theory of matrices , counting points in polytopes ; the problem of efficient sorting using shellsort ; the theory of petri nets ; the liveness of weighted circuits ; etc .    generally speaking",
    ", research on the frobenius problem can be classified into three different areas :    * formulas or algorithms for the exact computation of @xmath9 , including formulas for @xmath0 where the @xmath3 obey certain relations , such as being in arithmetic progression ; * the computational complexity of the problem ; * good upper or lower bounds on @xmath9 .    for @xmath10 , it is folklore that @xmath11 this formula is often attributed to sylvester @xcite , although he did not actually state it .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) gives an efficient algorithm to compute @xmath0 for two elements .",
    "for @xmath12 , efficient algorithms have been given by greenberg @xcite and davison @xcite ; if @xmath13 , these algorithms run in time bounded by a polynomial in @xmath14 .",
    "kannan @xcite gave a very complicated algorithm that runs in polynomial time in @xmath15 if @xmath16 is fixed , but is wildly exponential in @xmath16 .",
    "however , ramrez alfonsn @xcite proved that the general problem is np - hard , under turing reductions , by reducing from the integer knapsack problem .",
    "so it seems very likely that there is no simple formula for computing @xmath4 for arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , recent work by einstein , lichtblau , strzebonski , and wagon shows that in practice the frobenius number can be computed relatively efficiently , even for very large numbers , at least for @xmath17 .",
    "another active area of interest is estimating how big @xmath0 is in terms of @xmath1 for @xmath18 .",
    "it is known , for example , that @xmath19 .",
    "this follows from wilf s algorithm @xcite .",
    "many other bounds are known .",
    "one can also study variations on the frobenius problem .",
    "for example , given positive integers @xmath1 with @xmath2 , what is the number @xmath20 of positive integers not represented as a non - negative integer linear combination of the @xmath3 ?",
    "sylvester , in an 1884 paper @xcite , showed that @xmath21 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to generalize the frobenius problem to the setting of a free monoid . in this framework ,",
    "we start with a finite , nonempty alphabet @xmath22 , and consider the set of all finite words @xmath23 . instead of considering integers @xmath1 , we consider words @xmath24 . instead of considering linear combinations of integers , we instead consider the languages @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "actually , we consider several additional generalizations , which vary according to how we measure the size of the input , conditions on the input , and measures of the size of the result .",
    "for an application of the noncommutative frobenius problem , see clment , duval , guaiana , perrin , and rindone .    in order to motivate our definitions",
    ", we consider the easiest case first : where @xmath27 , a unary alphabet .",
    "suppose @xmath28 , for @xmath29 .",
    "the frobenius problem is evidently linked to many problems over unary languages .",
    "it figures , for example , in estimating the size of the smallest dfa equivalent to a given nfa @xcite .    if @xmath30 , by @xmath31 we mean @xmath32 , the complement of @xmath33 . if @xmath33 is a finite language , by @xmath34 we mean the cardinality of @xmath33 .",
    "evidently we have    suppose @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and write @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 is co - finite if and only @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath36 is co - finite , then the length of the longest word in @xmath38 is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "this result suggests that one appropriate noncommutative generalization of the condition @xmath37 is that @xmath41 be co - finite , and one appropriate generalization of the @xmath0 function is the length of the longest word not in @xmath36 .",
    "but there are other possible generalizations . instead of measuring the length of the longest omitted word",
    ", we could instead consider the _ state complexity _ of @xmath36 . by the state complexity of a regular language @xmath33 , written @xmath42 , we mean the number of states in the ( unique ) minimal deterministic finite automaton ( dfa ) accepting @xmath33 . in the unary case",
    ", this alternate measure has a nice expression in terms of the ordinary frobenius function :    let @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath43    since @xmath37 , every word of length @xmath44 will be in the set @xmath45",
    ". thus we can accept @xmath45 with a dfa having @xmath46 states , using a `` tail '' of @xmath47 states and a `` loop '' of one accepting state .",

    "we now turn to the main results of the paper . given as input a list of words @xmath1 , not necessarily distinct , and defining @xmath64 , we can measure the size of the input in a number of different ways :    * @xmath16 , the number of words ; * @xmath65 , the length of the longest word ; * @xmath66 , the total number of symbols ; * @xmath67 , the state complexity of the language represented by the input . *",
