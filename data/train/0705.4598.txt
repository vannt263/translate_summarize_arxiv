    "who would have thought it would be so fruitful ? in the past two years , cdf and  have produced over 35 separate results using  mesons .",
    "this represents the largest component of the tevatron b - physics program , and , indeed , puts the  meson in the position of being the second - most prolific particle , in terms of physics output , in the tevatron zoo  right after the top quark .",
    "this handy hadron has been used to study such diverse topics as qcd model building , physics beyond the standard model , the electro - weak symmetry breaking mechanism , and  violation , to name just a few . in all of these areas ,",
    "recent  results have sharpened our knowledge of the standard model and its weaknesses substantially .",
    "success comes at a price though  at least for conference audiences .",
    "the overwhelming number of results means that we can not discuss any of their beautiful facets in detail ; this article is already long enough .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on emphasizing the breadth of physics issues addressed by studies of the  meson , and will show how our understanding of these issues has improved since data from run ii at the tevatron has been analyzed .",
    "obviously , this represents a snapshot of the tevatron -physics program , taken with up to 1.3  of data .",
    "the fermilab tevatron accelerator continues to deliver proton - antiproton collisions to cdf and  at a furious pace . at the time of the conference",
    "each experiment had recorded over 2  of data , with more rolling in every day .",
    "the final section of these proceedings will then be devoted to a brief discussion of what we plan to do with the bounty of  mesons that will come with this additional data .",
    "before we embark upon a description of results , it s instructive to examine the capabilities of the tevatron collider experiments in areas important to the study of  mesons .",
    "both cdf@xcite and @xcite are well suited to take advantage of the large number of  mesons produced in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron .",
    "the  production rate within the cdf and  detector acceptance is around 600 hz , at luminosities of .",
    "this can be compared to around 1 hz at the b - factories , when they run at the @xmath0(5s ) resonance ; and 5000 hz at the upcoming lhcb experiment .",
    "thus the tevatron is the only facility where  mesons are produced currently in any large numbers .",
    "this large  production rate , however , is dwarfed by the rate of  bunch crossings ( 1.7 mhz ) meaning that triggers are critical to the b - physics program at the tevatron . both cdf and",
    "use three - level trigger systems and rely heavily ( almost exclusively in s case ) on single or di - lepton signals to collect samples of  mesons .",
    "makes use of its excellent muon detectors to construct low  threshold single- and di - muon triggers without resorting to muon impact parameter cuts , which bias decay length distributions , except at the highest tevatron luminosities .",
    "cdf uses both electrons and muons for b - physics triggers , but applies impact parameter cuts to most single - lepton triggers .    because the cdf trigger system is capable of accepting events from its first level at a rate of up to 30 khz ( the corresponding  level-1 bandwidth limit is around 2 khz )",
    ", the cdf collaboration has been able to design triggers that select , at level-1 , events with two tracks forming a vertex displaced from the primary  interaction point .",
    "such events are enriched with fully hadronic decays of mesons , which allows cdf access to the wide range of important studies that can be done using these decay modes .    for many of the analyses discussed in this article",
    "the primary means of identifying  mesons is through their semileptonic decay : @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "this decay has a branching fraction of 7.9%@xcite , and its identification highlights many of the experimental challenges that face cdf and . to begin with",
    ", there is the issue of lepton identification .  has the advantage here because of their muon detectors , which extend to pseudo - rapidities ( @xmath3 $ ] ) between @xmath42 , while cdf s muon system covers only @xmath5",
    "additionally , the  muon system is shielded by 1218 interaction lengths of material ( a factor of around three more than cdf s ) and includes toroidal magnets for local muon momentum measurements . taken together , these reduce many muon background sources in   to a negligible level .",
    "identification of  meson decays , on the other hand , requires excellent tracking capabilities .",
    "the experiments use @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 decay modes of the @xmath10  ( and charge conjugates ) in a range of analyses .",
    "cdf has the edge here , mainly because of the larger volume of their tracking system ( extending from radii of 1.5  137 cm , as compared to the tracker , which spans 2.8  52 cm ) and the larger number of space - point measurements it makes ( normally more than 100 for cdf , but only @xmath1120 for ) .",
    "this allows cdf to reconstruct multi - particle invariant masses with significantly better accuracy than , making combinatorial backgrounds less of a problem .",
    "finally , both detectors reconstruct displaced vertices with similar resolution , although cdf does a slightly better job because their tracking extends to lower radii .",
    "as we will see , resolution is particularly important in -mixing analyses , where time structures on the order of 100 fs must be reconstructed .",
    "both the cdf and  tracking systems are capable of this feat in the reconstruction of semileptonic  decays , having average resolutions in the 15 - 20 fs range .",
    "however , because of cdf s large fully hadronic  decay sample , they are also able to take advantage of the better vertexing resolution ( @xmath1210 fs ) achievable in these types of decay .    using these upgraded detectors ,",
    "both experiments have been able to accumulate  meson data samples that contain orders of magnitude more events than have previously been observed at lep or run i at the tevatron ( 19921996 ) .",
    "now let s look at what we ve done with this harvest .",
    "knowledge of the basic properties of the  meson  how it is produced , how massive it is , how long it lives , how it decays  is the foundation upon which we build all subsequent studies using the particle .",
    "accurate measurements of these quantities are thus essential for the tests of the standard model , and the searches for its extensions , described later",
    ". however ,  property determinations are also useful in themselves as tests of our ability to use qcd , whether through models or by lattice calculations .",
    "measurements made by cdf and  since the start of run ii have substantially increased our knowledge in the full range of this area .",
    "let s start with production .",
    "a major question here concerns whether the fragmentation of quark - antiquark pairs into heavy flavor hadrons is governed by universal functions independent of the type of collisions producing the quarks .",
    "cdf has made preliminary measurements of the relative fragmentation fractions of hadrons in collisions .",
    "their preliminary measurement of the  fraction relative to that of and uses @xmath13 decays in 0.36  of data : @xmath14 where the last error reflects the uncertainty on the @xmath15 branching ratio .",
    "when corrected for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , their measurement , @xmath18 = ( 12.7 @xmath4 3.8)% is consistent with , but slightly higher than the lep average of ( 10.4 @xmath4 0.9)%@xcite , indicating that no large differences in fragmentation between and  are likely .",
    "mass and lifetime are also important properties of the  meson , and run ii results have dramatically improved our knowledge of them . before the start of run ii , the  mass world average of 5369.6 @xmath19 2.4 mev@xcite was dominated by 32  candidates reconstructed by cdf . using 0.22  of data from run ii",
    ", corresponding to 185 candidate decays , cdf has improved this measurement by almost a factor of three to 5366.01 @xmath19 0.73 @xmath4 0.33 mev@xcite . on the lifetime side , both cdf and",
    "have contributed to a factor of two improvement in the accuracy of the mean  lifetime measurement since the start of run ii : from @xmath20 = 1.461 @xmath4 0.057 ps in 2003@xcite to @xmath20 = 1.451 @xmath21 ps in 2006@xcite .",
    "although each experiment has measured the  lifetime in several different modes , which contain different mixtures of -even and -odd states ( as discussed later in this article ) , the most precise measurement , @xmath20 = 1.398 @xmath4 0.044 @xmath21 ps , currently comes from s analysis of @xmath22 decays in 0.40  of data@xcite .    using the new average  lifetime , we find agreement with predictions of the lifetime ratio @xmath23 , calculated using heavy quark effective theory , at the 2.3-sigma level :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "as a final note to this section on  measurements using the , cdf has taken the first steps toward measuring direct -violation in the  system using their preliminary @xmath24 measurement , discussed previously .",
    "in addition to measuring the branching ratio for this mode , they also determine its asymmetry : @xmath25 which differs from zero by 2.5-sigma and is in good agreement with the standard model expectation of @xmath110.37@xcite .",
    "looking back on the last few years , we can take pride in the good use to which the  meson has been put at the tevatron in run ii .",
    "we have observed many decay modes of this particle for the first time and are zeroing in on an observation of the flavor changing neutral current in  decays , while being only a factor of 30 away from the standard model prediction for .",
    "we have also made remarkable progress in our understanding of mixing , with a first observation of its oscillation frequency after more than a decade of searching ; and new sensitivity to the -violating phase in this system .",
    "however , we certainly do not plan to rest on our laurels .",
    "the tevatron is operating extremely well , delivering luminosity at a pace where we can expect a total run ii data sample of up to 8  per experiment .",
    "in addition , both experiments are upgrading their capabilities , with s new layer-0 silicon detector of particular importance to the b - physics program .",
    "although the larger instantaneous luminosities seen by cdf and  will force the imposition of more restrictive triggers , significantly larger  data samples should be available in the next 12 years .",
    "as many of the measurements presented here remain statistics limited ( a notable expectation is the extraction of from  and ) this added data should allow a vibrant continuing program of measurements of rare decay modes and -violation in the system .",
    "you have , most certainly , not heard the last of the  meson at the tevatron !",
    "i would like to thank the  and cdf b - physics working group convenors , brendan casey , cheng - ju lin , manfred paulini , and andrzej zieminski , for their help in preparing this presentation .",
    "my warmest gratitude also goes to the conference organizers for preparing such a fascinating program ( not to mention the excellent food , drink , and skiing ) !",
