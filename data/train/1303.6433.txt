    "the handbag approach to hard exclusive leptoproduction of photons and mesons off protons has extensively been studied during the last fifteen years .",
    "this approach is based on factorization of the process amplitudes in hard subprocesses , e.g.  @xmath1 , and soft hadronic matrix elements parametrized in terms of gpds .",
    "this factorization property has been shown to hold rigorously in the generalized bjorken regime of large photon virtuality , @xmath2 , and large energy @xmath3 but fixed @xmath4 . since most of the data , in particular those from the present jlab , are not measured in this kinematical regime one has to be aware of power corrections from various sources .",
    "which kind of power correction is the most important one and is to be taken into account is still under debate .",
    "nevertheless progress has been made in the understanding of the dvcs and dvmp data . in this talk ,",
    "presented at qcdn12 and spin12 ( see @xcite ) , i am going to report on an extraction of the gpds from dvmp @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the gpds are constructed from double distributions ( dds)@xcite where the latter are parametrized as zero - skewness gpds times weight functions which generate their skewness dependence .",
    "the anstze for the zero - skewness gpds consist of their corresponding forward limits multiplied by exponentials in mandelstam @xmath5 with profile functions parametrized in a regge - like manner with slopes of appropriate regge trajectories and constants for the @xmath5 dependence of their residues .",
    "these profile functions are simplified versions of more complicated ones proposed in @xcite . at small momentum fractions ,",
    "@xmath6 , they fall together with the ones used in @xcite . because of a strong @xmath7 correlation observed in @xcite the regge - like profile functions",
    "can only be applied at small @xmath8 .",
    "the forward limits of the zero - skewness gpds are in some cases ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) given by the usual parton densities , in other cases ( for the @xmath0-type ones ) they are parametrized like the parton densities with a number of free parameters adjusted to experiment .    in sect .  2 some details on the extraction of the gpds",
    "are presented . in sects .",
    "3 @xmath0 is discussed and in sect .",
    "4 the transversity gpds . a summary is given in sect .",
    "as an example we quote the convolution formula for the production of longitudinally polarized vector mesons : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 either @xmath9 or @xmath0 .",
    "similar convolution formulas hold for transversely polarized vector mesons and for pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the subprocess amplitude @xmath17 for partonic helicity @xmath18 is to be calculated perturbatively using @xmath19-factorization .",
    "this means that in the subprocess quark transverse degrees of freedom as well as sudakov suppression @xcite are taken into account .",
    "the emission and reabsorption of the partons by the protons are treated collinearly .",
    "this approach also allows to calculate the amplitudes for transversely polarized photons and like - wise polarized vector mesons which are infrared singular in collinear factorization .",
    "the transverse photon amplitudes are rather strong for @xmath20 as is known from the ratio of longitudinal and transverse cross sections for @xmath21 and @xmath22 production @xcite . the approach used in @xcite bears similarity to the color dipole model @xcite .",
    "there is another problem with vector meson production : in collinear factorization the cross section for the production of @xmath21 drops as @xmath23 with increasing @xmath24 while experimentally @xcite it approximately falls as @xmath25 . in the above sketched approach the required suppression of the amplitudes at low @xmath24",
    "is generated by the evolution of the gpds and by @xmath26 effects . in @xcite",
    "however gpds are proposed which have a much stronger evolution than those used in @xcite .",
    "at least for hera kinematics the gpds advocated for in @xcite lead to fair fits of the hera data on dvmp in collinear factorization .    in @xcite parameters of the dds",
    "are fitted to the available data on @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath27 production from hermes , compass , e665 , h1 and zeus .",
    "the data cover a large kinematical range : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , i.e. bjorken-@xmath6 and , hence , skewness , is small .",
    "data from the present jlab ( characterized by large @xmath4 and small @xmath3 ) are not taken into account in these fits because they are likely affected by strong power corrections at least in some cases ( e.g. @xmath21 production ) .",
    "constraints from nucleon form factors and from positivity bounds @xcite are taken into account .",
    "the analysis is strongly simplified by the fact that , for small @xmath4 , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 cross sections are under control of contributions from the gpd @xmath9 , other gpds can be ignored .",
    "since @xmath9 is rather well fixed by many constraints ( pdfs , nucleon form factors ) the vector meson cross sections allow to pin down the remaining few free parameters of @xmath9 .",
    "all other gpds are much less well known than @xmath9",
    ". their extraction requires polarization observables or hard leptoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the latter process is however complicated to analyze since many gpds contribute at the same level .",
    "the analysis performed in @xcite leads to a fair description of all the mentioned data .",
    "what has been learned about the gpds from this analysis is summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] . for details of the parametrization and values of the parameters it is referred to @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the gpds extracted in @xcite have been exploited to compute dvcs to leading - twist accuracy and leading - order of pqcd while the bethe - heitler contribution is worked out without any approximation .",
    "it should be realized that , to this level of accuracy , collinear emission and reabsorption of the partons from the protons forces the partonic subprocess of dvcs to be collinear as well .",
    "a detailed comparison of this theoretical approach with experiment performed in @xcite , reveals reasonable agreement with hermes , h1 and zeus data and a less satisfactory description of the large - skewness , small @xmath3 jlab data ( see talk by f. sabatie this conference ) .",
    "note that the gpds extracted in @xcite are not optimized for the latter kinematical region .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in the same spirit a dvcs analysis is performed in @xcite .",
    ".[tab1 ] status of small - skewness gpds as extracted dvmp .",
    "no information is presently available on gpds not appearing in the table . except of @xmath9 for gluons and sea quarks all gpds",
    "are only probed for scales of about @xmath30 . for comparison",
    "five stars are assigned to pdfs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "let me now discuss the gpd @xmath0 in some detail .",
    "the analysis of the nucleon form factors carried through in @xcite provided the zero - skewness gpds for valence quarks which can be used to construct the dds .",
    "since in 2004 data on the neutron form factors were only available for @xmath31 the parameters of the zero - skewness gpd @xmath32 were not well fixed ; a wide range of values were allowed for the powers @xmath33 and @xmath34 which control the large-@xmath6 behavior of the forward limits of @xmath32 . in the recent reanalysis of the form",
    "factors @xcite making use of all new data which for the neutron now extend to much larger values of @xmath5 , similar results for the valence - quark gpds are obtained but the powers @xmath35 are now better determined .",
    "not much is known about @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "there is only a sum rule for the second moments of @xmath0 @xcite at @xmath38 @xmath39 it turns out that the valence contribution to the sum rule is very small @xcite .",
    "hence , the second moments of the gluon and sea - quark gpd @xmath0 cancel each other almost completely . for parametrizations of the forward limits of @xmath0 which do not have nodes except at the end - points ( see e.g.  @xcite ) this property approximately holds of other moments as well and even for convolutions like ( [ eq : convolutions - mesons ] ) . for @xmath40",
    "there is also a positivity bound for its fourier transform with respect to the momentum transfer @xcite which forbids a large strange quark contribution and , assuming a flavor - symmetric sea , a large gluon contribution too .",
    "determining the normalization of @xmath40 by assuming that the bound for it is saturated for some values of @xmath6 ( note the bound is quadratic in @xmath41 ) , one can subsequently fix the normalization of @xmath36 from the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrulee ] ) @xcite .    for given @xmath9 , as for instance extracted from the dvmp cross sections @xcite , the gpd @xmath0 is probed by the transverse target asymmetry @xmath42\\,.\\ ] ] the data on @xmath21 production from hermes @xcite and compass @xcite",
    "are well fitted by the described parametrization of @xmath0 .",
    "however , only @xmath0 for valence quarks matters for @xmath43 since the sea and gluon contribution to @xmath0 cancel to a large extent as remarked above .",
    "fortunately the analysis of dvcs data @xcite provides additional although not very precise information on @xmath37 . to leading - order of pqcd",
    "there is no gluon contribution in dvcs and therefore @xmath37 becomes visible .",
    "the hermes collaboration has measured the transverse target asymmetries for dvcs and for the bh - dvcs interference term @xcite . despite the large experimental errors it seems that a negative @xmath37 is favored . as an example",
    "the data on the bh - dvcs interference are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aut ] and compared to the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "independent information on @xmath36 would be of interest .",
    "this may be obtained from a measurement of the transverse target polarization in @xmath44 photoproduction @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath45 cross sections versus @xmath46 .",
    "preliminary data are taken from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=37.0% ]   and @xmath45 cross sections versus @xmath46 .",
    "preliminary data are taken from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the knowledge of @xmath0 which is admittedly poor , allows for an estimate of the angular momenta the partons inside the proton carry . at @xmath47",
    "they are given by the second moments of @xmath9 and @xmath0 @xmath48\\ , , \\qquad 2j^g=\\big[g_{20}+e_{20}^g\\big]\\,.\\ ] ] the values of the @xmath9-moments can be evaluated from the pdfs , for instance from @xcite . since a negative @xmath40 is favored as we learned from the combined analysis of dvmp and dvcs , @xmath36 is positive ( remember the no node assumption ) .",
    "therefore , the second moment of the latter , @xmath49 , is positive and adds to @xmath50 which is large and positive as is known for a long time ( it represents the fraction of the proton momentum carried by gluons ) . from these considerations it follows that the total angular momentum carried by the gluons is large as well . according to @xcite",
    ", it amounts to @xmath51 .",
    "there is a second set of four gpds , the transversity ones which are characterized by opposite helicities of the emitted and reabsorbed partons . in general",
    "they play a minor role in exclusive reactions and not many phenomenological studies are devoted to them ( an example is @xcite ) .",
    "however , it became evident recently that the transversity gpds contribute strongly to leptoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence for transversity came from the @xmath52 harmonics of the @xmath27 production cross section measured with a transversely polarized target @xcite . from these data",
    "we learned that this observable is large and does not seem to vanish for forward scattering .",
    "such a behavior requires a strong helicity non - flip amplitude for transversely polarized virtual photons . within the handbag approach this amplitude is under control of the transversity gpd @xmath11 in combination with a twist-3 pion wave function @xcite",
    "this amplitude is parametrically suppressed by @xmath53 as compared to the asymptotically dominant amplitude for longitudinal polarized photons . here , @xmath54 at the scale of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a current quark mass .",
    "hence , this twist-3 effect is quite large for experimentally accessible values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover lattice qcd @xcite provides some evidence of a large gpd @xmath57 with the same sign and almost the same size for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "both the gpds , @xmath11 and @xmath60 are parametrized in an analog fashion than the other gpds and their parameters are fixed by fits to the hermes @xmath27 data @xcite and by taking recourse to the lattice - qcd results . with",
    "the gpds determined this way , the behavior of the transverse target asymmetry can be understood quantitatively and predictions for the productions of the @xmath45 and other pseudoscalar mesons have been given @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath45 cross section is dominated by the contributions from the transversity gpds except in the near forward region ; the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse cross sections is much smaller than 1 for @xmath20 .",
    "the results for @xmath45 production are in fair agreement with the large bjorken-@xmath6 ( small @xmath3 ) data from clas @xcite .",
    "another interesting prediction is that the ratio of the @xmath61 and @xmath45 cross sections is much smaller than 1 ( except in the near forward region ) in sharp contrast to expectations @xcite .",
    "also this result which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aut ] , is in reasonable agreement with preliminary clas data @xcite .",
    "i have briefly summarized the recent progress in the analysis for hard exclusive leptoproduction of mesons and photons within the handbag approach .",
    "we learned that the data on both reactions are consistent with each other in so far as they can be described with a common set of gpds .",
    "in fact the gpds constructed from double distributions and with parameters adjusted to the meson data allow for a parameter - free calculation of dvcs .    of course the gpds are not perfect , they are an approximation .",
    "improvements are required for which the future compass and jlab12 will be of help .",
    "possible improvements may include the use of more recent versions of the pdfs , eventual modifications of the parametrizations of the gpds , in particular of the profile functions of the corresponding double distributions , and allowance for a non - zero @xmath62-term .",
    "updated zero - skewness gpds @xmath9 and @xmath0 for valence quarks have already been obtained from the recent analysis of the nucleon form factors @xcite .",
