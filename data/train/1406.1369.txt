    "the inflationary paradigm was originally proposed to address the horizon , flatness , and monopole problems in the standard big - bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "moreover , inflation can be responsible for the generation of primordial density perturbations @xcite and gravitational waves @xcite by stretching quantum fluctuations over super - hubble scales .",
    "the simplest slow - roll inflationary scenario driven by the potential energy of a single scalar field gives rise to nearly scale - invariant primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "while the primordial scalar perturbation has been observed by cobe @xcite , wmap @xcite , and planck @xcite satellites as a form of temperature anisotropies of the comic microwave background ( cmb ) , gravitational waves had eluded the detection for a long time .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the relative amplitude of gravitational waves to scalar perturbations is suppressed in the standard inflationary scenario ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 and the spectral index @xmath15 of scalar perturbations are two important quantities to probe models of inflation by using cmb observations . although the planck satellite measured @xmath15 in high precision , this is not sufficient to narrow down the allowed models of inflation unless @xmath14 is constrained tightly @xcite .",
    "the detection of primordial gravitational waves is crucial to break the degeneracy between inflationary models .",
    "in fact , there is the consistency relation between @xmath14 and the spectral index of primordial gravitational waves @xmath16 : @xmath17 for potential - driven slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves is a litmus test for inflationary cosmology .",
    "recently , the bicep2 collaboration reported the evidence for the detection of b - mode polarization in the cmb @xcite .",
    "they claimed that the observed b - mode can be fit by a lensed @xmath18-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath18cdm ) model with @xmath19 . this bound is larger than the upper limit @xmath20 derived by the planck data of temperature anisotropies @xcite combined with the wmap large - angle polarization ( wp ) data @xcite .",
    "there is also an argument that the presence of the polarized dust weakens the constraints on @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "since the bicep2 measured the b - mode polarization at a single frequency ( 150 ghz ) , the upcoming independent observations at different frequencies with precise measurements of the dust polarization will be crucial to clarify whether the signal is really the cosmological origin or not .",
    "if the b - mode polarization reported by bicep2 comes from the primordial origin , it marks a milestone in the inflationary cosmology @xcite . since the primordial b - mode can be generated only from tensor or vector perturbations @xcite and vector perturbations sourced by topological defects are disfavored by the cmb data @xcite , the detection of b - mode polarization indicates an indirect discovery of inflationary gravitational waves .",
    "a relatively large value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the order of 0.1 can be explained by the so - called large field inflationary models in which the field variation @xmath21 during inflation is greater than @xmath22 , where @xmath23 gev is the reduced planck mass @xcite .",
    "the typical examples of the large - field models are chaotic inflation @xcite and natural inflation @xcite .",
    "although chaotic inflation with quartic potential is disfavored by the planck data @xcite , the non - minimal coupling @xcite can reduce the value of @xmath14 @xcite so that the model can be compatible with the data .",
    "a similar property also holds in the presence of galileon couplings @xcite and field derivative couplings to the einstein tensor @xcite .",
    "if the large - field models correspond to a realistic paradigm of inflation , the next generation interferometric detectors such as decigo @xcite and bbo @xcite may allow us to detect inflationary gravitational waves directly .",
    "these instruments are designed to measure tensor perturbations at much shorter wavelengths relative to the perturbations associated with the cmb b - mode polarization .",
    "these frequencies correspond to the mode that re - entered the hubble radius during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "the direct detection of gravitational waves @xcite contains useful information of the very early universe , such as the effective relativistic degrees of freedom @xcite and the reheating temperature after inflation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we compute the spectra of the gravitational wave background for several large - field inflationary models : chaotic inflation , natural inflation and non - minimally coupled inflation with quartic potential .",
    "then , we update the previous calculations @xcite of signal - to - noise ratios by decigo and bbo with various reheating temperatures .",
    "we also calculate signal - to - noise ratio for ultimate decigo whose sensitivity is only limited by quantum noise @xcite .",
    "we show that , even if these models are degenerate in terms of the cmb observables @xmath15 and @xmath14 , it is possible to distinguish them from the direct detection of inflationary gravitational waves .",

    "for the model ( iii ) the direct detections would be feasible for @xmath304 ( upgraded decigo ) and @xmath325 ( bbo ) .",
    "we have thus shown that the large - field inflationary models with @xmath14 larger than the order of 0.01 leave interesting observational signatures in the gravitational wave background .",
    "in particular , the models in which reheating is driven by an effective massless inflaton field can be distinguished from the massive models with a temporal matter era after inflation .",
