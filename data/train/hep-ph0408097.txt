    "at high energies , the linear evolution equations , based in the standard perturbative qcd , predict a high gluon density , requiring that the growth of the parton density has to have a limit @xcite - otherwise violation of the froissart - martin bound occurs - and expected to saturate at a scale @xmath1 , forming a color glass condensate ( cgc)@xcite . in this context , the search for signatures of a cgc description of the saturated regime is an outstanding aspect of investigation in heavy ion colliders .",
    "the first results of relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , on charged hadron multiplicity in @xmath2 collisions , were treated considering that the cgc formulation gives a natural qualitative explanation of the data@xcite .",
    "however , there are several issues to be clarified , before conclude that the dynamical of the partonic system should be described by a cgc already at rhic energies .",
    "particularly the current data are reasonably described by other models based on different assumptions @xcite . however , the charged multiplicity distribution in pseudo - rapidity for deuteron - gold collision is estimated within the cgc formalism at the deuteron fragmentation region , and pointed out as a probable signature of the saturated regime @xcite . for a review of the cgc signatures",
    "@xcite .    in order to investigate the high energy limit of the partonic interactions ,",
    "the proton - nucleus scattering was proposed as an ideal experiment to give evidences of the saturation effects described by the cgc in the proton fragmentation region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dilepton production was shown to be a sensitive probe of the perturbative shadowing and saturation dynamics in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite in the forward kinematical region .",
    "it is an interesting observable since it is a clean process in which there is no strong interaction with the nuclear medium final state .    in this work",
    "we investigate quantitative features of the dilepton production in the forward region of proton - nucleus collisions in the context of the color glass condensate .",
    "in particular , the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution is studied focusing attention to the small @xmath0 region , where the saturation effects are expected to be more significant .",
    "the main goal of this work is to show the effects of saturation at small @xmath0 described by the cgc .",
    "their presence at small @xmath0 should be considered as a possible signature of the saturation effects when contrasted with proton - proton results .",
    "this comparison is performed evaluating the ratio between proton - nucleus and proton - proton cross section .",
    "this ratio shows two diferent behaviors ; it presents cronin type peak ( if a local gaussian for the correlator function is used ) and a large suppression ( if a non - local gaussian is used ) , being a most suitable probe of the status of the cronin effect as a final or initial state effect .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section one",
    "presents a brief discussion on color glass condensate formalism . in sec .",
    "3 the dilepton production cross section within the cgc formalism is presented .",
    "the sec . 4",
    "is devoted to the study on the color field correlator , which is a fundamental factor in the cgc approach .",
    "the numerical results are given and discussed in the last section where our conclusions are also presented .",
    "the color glass condensate picture holds in a frame in which the hadron propagates at the speed of light and , by lorentz contraction , appears as an infinitesimally thin two - dimensional sheet located at the light cone .",
    "the formalism supporting this picture is in terms of a classical effective theory valid at small @xmath3 region ( large gluon density ) , and was originally proposed to describe the gluons in large nuclei @xcite .    at small @xmath3 and/or large @xmath4",
    "one expects the transition of the regime described by the standard perturbative qcd ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) , balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) ) to a new regime where the processes like recombination of partons should be important in the parton cascade @xcite . in this regime , the growth of the parton distribution is expected to saturate below a specific scale @xmath1 , forming a color glass condensate @xcite . this saturated field , meaning the dominant field or gluons , has a large occupation number and allows the use of semi - classical methods .",
    "these methods provide the description of the small @xmath3 gluons as being radiated from fast moving color sources ( parton with higher values of @xmath3 ) , being described by a color source density @xmath5 , with internal dynamics frozen by lorentz time dilatation , thus forming a color glass .",
    "the small @xmath3 gluons saturate at a value of order @xmath6 for @xmath7 , corresponding to a multi - particle bose condensate state .",
    "the color fields are driven by the classical yang - mills equation of motion with the sources given by the large @xmath3 partons .",
    "the large @xmath3 partons move nearly at the speed of light in the positive @xmath8 direction .    in the cgc approach",
    "the light cone variables are employed , where , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the variable @xmath13 is the time light cone , and @xmath14 its variable conjugated identified with the energy as @xmath15 .",
    "the large @xmath3 partons ( fast ) have momentum @xmath16 , emitting ( or absorbing ) soft gluons with momentum @xmath17 , generating a color current only with the @xmath18 component @xmath19 . in this framework , the nucleus is situated at @xmath20 , with an uncertainty @xmath21 , and there is a separation between fast and soft partons , implying that the former have large lifetime while soft partons have a short lifetime .",
    "these features assure that the color source density @xmath5 should be considered time independent , since for the emitted soft gluons ( small @xmath3 gluons ) the source is frozen in time .",
    "however , after a time interval of order @xmath22 ( @xmath23 being the energy of the source in the light - cone ) the configuration of the source is different . in order to have a gauge - invariant formulation ,",
    "the source @xmath5 must be treated as a stochastic variable with zero expectation value .",
    "for these reason , an average over all configurations is required and it is performed through a weight function @xmath24 $ ] , which depends upon the dynamics of the fast modes , and upon the intermediate scale @xmath25 , which defines fast ( @xmath26 ) and soft ( @xmath27 ) modes .",
    "the classical fields obey the yang - mills equation of motion , @xmath28 and a physical observable is obtained by averaging the solution to this equation over all configurations of @xmath5 , with the gauge - invariant weight function @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the effective theory is valid only at soft momenta of order @xmath25 . indeed , going to a much softer scale , there are large radiative corrections which invalidate the classical approximation . the modifications to the effective classical theory",
    "is governed by a functional , nonlinear , evolution equation , originally derived by jalilian - marian , kovner , leonidov and weigert ( jimwlk ) @xcite for the statistical weight function @xmath24 $ ] associated with the random variable @xmath29 .",
    "the solution for such functional evolution equation is not well determined yet and in order to make predictions or comparison with data , some phenomenological treatment should be given to the weight function . in this work",
    "an approximation to the weight function which is reasonable when we have large nuclei is used and consists in taking a gaussian form @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", most calculations in the cgc should be done quasi - analytically . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that a gaussian weight function can accommodate both the bfkl evolution of the gluon distribution at high transverse momenta , and the gluon saturation phenomenon at low transverse momenta .",
    "a non - local gaussian distribution of color sources has been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite as a mean - field asymptotic solution for the jimwlk equation and provides some modifications concerning phenomenological properties of the observables @xcite .",
    "the local gaussian weight function assures that the color sources are correlated locally , on the other side , the non - local gaussian allows correlations over large distances . in the following sections the phenomenological consequences of the choice of a local or non - local gaussian type for the weight function are investigated concerning the transverse momentum of the dileptons .",
    "at high energies , the dilepton production in hadronic collisions looks like a bremsstrahlung of a virtual photon with momentum @xmath30 decaying into a lepton pair , which can occur before and after the interaction of the quark ( momentum @xmath31 ) with the dense saturated gluonic field ( momentum @xmath32 ) of the target , in our case the nucleus @xmath4 .",

    "it is verified that at moderate @xmath0 the calculations show a cronin type peak for rhic and for lhc ( there is a suppression of the dilepton production at rhic and lhc energies comparing with the proton - proton collisions at small @xmath0 , at intermediate @xmath0 the ratio is larger than 1 , and there is a suppression at large @xmath0 up to get the value 1 ) .",
    "such peak increases and is shifted to larger @xmath0 at larger rapidities , due to the fact that the saturation scale grows with the rapidity and no evolution is taking into account .    concerning the cronin effect ,",
    "such peak is enlarged at large rapidities if the local gaussian correlator function with the same energy dependence implemented here is used @xcite , in complete disagreement with the brahms experiment at forward rapidities @xcite . in the same ref .",
    "@xcite the cronin effect was studied using a non - local gaussian distribution for the weight function and the cronin peak suppression is reached .",
    "however , there is a suppression on the normalization at centrality region , which is not consistent with the rhic data in central rapidity @xcite , emphasizing that the the non - local gaussian weight function should be the right physics at forward rapidities .    on the dilepton side ,",
    "the behavior of the ratio @xmath123 , shows the same features of the cronin peak at forward rapidities when investigated with the local gaussian ( the peak is enlarged and shifted to high @xmath0 at large rapidities ) .",

    "the suppression of the ratio @xmath123 is verified showing exactly the same features presented in the cronin effect @xcite , being a possible clean observable to study this property .",
    "although , the cronin effect was considered as a final state one in the ref .",
    "@xcite , in our analysis , the dilepton production seems to clarify this aspect .",
    "it was obtained that the cronin type peak ( or the suppression of the cronin peak ) in the dilepton @xmath0 distribution appears as an initial state effect . in the fig .",
    "( [ rationonloc ] ) the solid line represents the calculation for rapidity @xmath66 and the dashed line for rapidity @xmath141 at rhic energies . for lhc energies the long - dashed line represents the calculation for rapidity @xmath66 and the dot - dashed line for rapidity @xmath141 .    at rhic energies ,",
    "the effect of suppression appears if the nonlocal gaussian in the correlator color field is used , sugesting the measurement of such suppression , although the detectors should not be able to measure such behavior @xcite . on the other hand , at lhc energies , the suppression of the ratio @xmath142 reach large values of @xmath0 and such suppression increases with the rapidity .",
    "it is interesting to address that at lhc the experimental facilities provide a detection of dileptons in the forward region with transverse momentum above 1.5 gev , depending on the rate of the signal of the observable and on the signal from physics and machine sources @xcite .",
    "this feature assures that at lhc energies such suppression behavior should be detectable too .",
    "in this work the large saturation effects described by the color glass condensate in the dilepton production at small @xmath0 region and the dependence of the large @xmath0 spectra on the saturation scale value are verified .",
    "although at rhic , the transverse momentum distribution of the dilepton should not be measurable in the very small @xmath0 , at intermediate @xmath0 , the comparison between @xmath139 and @xmath124 cross section , provides a tool to study the cronin effect and the dynamics of the color glass condensate .",
    "particularly , the dilepton transverse momentum distribution presents the suppression of the cronin type peak , as observed in the inclusive observables , if a non - local gaussian is used .",
    "such behavior is observed in the fig .",
    "( [ rationonloc ] ) . at the lhc energies , at forward rapidities , the effect of suppression increases ( fig .",

    "such large suppression at high energies gives an indication that dilepton transverse momentum provides a clear probe of the color glass condensate description of the high energy hadronic interactions in the forward rapidity region .",

    "in addition to this analysis , in a recent work @xcite , the high @xmath0 and low mass region in the dilepton production in perturbative qcd with all - order resummation was pointed as a good probe of the gluon distribution , as was indicated in the refs .",
