    ". next , let us mention here that there is no loss of generality in assuming a space @xmath0 with ( reversible ) bicombing @xmath2 to be complete . as for two points @xmath24 in the completion @xmath25 , we may ( and must ) set @xmath26 given two sequences @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",

    "the unit ball @xmath38 is then said to be an asymptotic subset of @xmath0 .",
    "preceding the work of wenger and in the context of busemann spaces , kleiner showed an equivalence between this asymptotic rank and the more classical minkowski rank defined as follows .",
    "the _ minkowski rank _ of a space @xmath0 is the supremum over all @xmath1 for which there is a @xmath1-dimensional normed space embedding isometrically into @xmath0 .",
    "the main result for busemann spaces , the one we are about to generalize , is theorem d in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : d ] forms the missing piece to carry over ( most of ) kleiner s theorem  d to our setting and generalizes the analogous proposition  10.22 in @xcite ( with a slight improvement even in the case of busemann spaces ) .    [ thm : d ] let @xmath0 be a proper metric space with a bicombing @xmath2 and cocompact isometry group .",
    "suppose there are sequences @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and a normed vector space @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 , and @xmath36 converges to the unit ball @xmath37 in the gromov - hausdorff topology",
    ". then @xmath34 can be isometrically embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "the original proof relies in a crucial way upon properties of busemann functions that are no longer available in our context .",
    "( even for such a simple case as @xmath39 with the supremum norm , the indefinitely many ( linear ) rays issuing from @xmath40 produce only @xmath41 busemann functions . )",
    "therefore we take a quite different road and make use of the bicombing geodesics only to provide us with a barycenter map by means of which we define a riemannian integral for maps with values in spaces with bicombings . after the proof of theorem  [ thm : d ] , which involves a metric differentiation argument and a convolution like operation",
    ", we finally state the analogue to kleiner s theorem  theorem  [ thm : dreally ] . among other things ,",
    "this theorem shows the following .",
    "every proper cocompact metric space @xmath0 with a bicombing contains an @xmath1-flat ( an isometrically embedded @xmath1-dimensional normed space ) whenever it contains an @xmath1-quasiflat ( a quasi - isometrically embedded @xmath1-dimensional normed space ) .",
    "the first result of that kind was shown for manifolds of non - positive curvature in @xcite .    in section  [ chapter : barycenters ] we preliminarily develop the barycenter map and then devote section  [ chapter : asymptotic rank ] to the proofs of [ thm : d ] and [ thm : dreally ] .",
    "but first we end this section with the prior mentioned statement about passing from a possibly non - reversible bicombing to a reversible one .",
    "[ prop : forcereversible ] if a proper metric space @xmath0 admits a ( possibly non - reversible ) bicombing @xmath2 , then @xmath0 admits a reversible bicombing @xmath42 .",
    "first we claim that the existence of a bicombing is equivalent to the existence of a midpoint assignment @xmath43 ( i.e.  @xmath44 is a point such that @xmath45 ) with the additional ( conical ) property @xmath46 and this equivalence holds for any complete space @xmath0 ( which every proper space is ) .",

    "it suffices to show that , starting from @xmath63 , we can construct a symmetric midpoint assignment @xmath64 , i.e.  one with @xmath65 for all @xmath66 . for a pair @xmath67",
    "we define the sequences @xmath68 by @xmath69 we have @xmath70 by applying to the definition of the sequences as well as @xmath71 the latter results by induction over @xmath72 and the fact that @xmath73 implies @xmath74 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the set of all midpoints between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . consequently ,",
    "if the monotone sequence @xmath77 would not converge to zero , then @xmath78 for all @xmath79 and some @xmath80 thereby contradicting compactness .",
    "so both sequences converge to a common limit and we set @xmath81 .",
    "the verification that @xmath64 obeys follows when taking the limit @xmath82 of either of the inequalities @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the sequences in the construction of @xmath85 . and",
    "these inequalities are easily shown by mutual induction .",
    "now we develop the tool that forms a crucial component in the proof of the main result . in  @xcite",
    ", es - sahib and heinich introduced an elegant barycenter construction for busemann spaces , which was reviewed and partly improved in a recent paper by navas  @xcite .",
    "the construction and proofs translate almost verbatim to spaces with reversible bicombings .",
    "as such spaces may lack unique midpoints , the only modification required is to set @xmath86 . after reviewing the construction we define the integration mentioned previously .",
    "we need two more definitions before we can start . for an isometry @xmath87 and a bicombing @xmath2 on @xmath0",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _ @xmath88-equivariant _ if @xmath89=[{\\gamma}(x),{\\gamma}(y)]$ ] for all @xmath66 .",

    "we have @xmath96 .",

    "thus confronted with the task of computing @xmath99 in @xmath0 when @xmath166 , we may as well compute the linear barycenter of @xmath167 and take the preimage .",
    "this remark is of course rather trivial since a map @xmath168 as above transports one bicombing into the other , and therefore @xmath163 and @xmath165 are indistinguishable from our point of view .",
    "the fact that may not hold prevents us to define the barycenter for probability measures with , say , finite support . to address this defect ,",
    "one is tempted to define @xmath169 and hope this limit always exists .",

    "consequently our upper bound now reads @xmath188 by symmetry of this expression we may replace @xmath189 by @xmath190 . running the sum over @xmath191 and exploiting vandermonde s identity we simplify",
    "further to @xmath192 the fraction of binomial coefficients is the probability mass function of a hypergeometric distribution with parameters @xmath147 ( draws without replacement ) , @xmath193 ( balls in the urn ) and @xmath194 ( balls that count ) .",

    "we define a new rha @xmath338 on @xmath339 by @xmath340 as we defined the integral for probability measures only , the above integral is understood to be taken with respect to the measure appropriately normalized . comparing @xmath283 to @xmath338 by means of yields @xmath341 ,",

    "consequently @xmath372 from the assumed lipschitz continuity of @xmath283 .",
    "now we split the integral according to these two cases and get for the first one @xmath373 the second part can be estimated generously by @xmath374 where @xmath375 is the orthogonal projection of the unit ball @xmath38 .",

    "since the domains @xmath339 are convex , the lipschitz estimate extends to all pairs @xmath24 . to conclude step  2 , we concatenate every @xmath338 with the @xmath379-lipschitz contraction @xmath380 towards @xmath381 producing @xmath154-lipschitz maps @xmath382 . and",
    "the estimate @xmath383 together with , say , @xmath384 for all but finitely many @xmath133 ensures that @xmath382 is still an rha .",

    "keep in mind the following example of an rha , which may justify why we have to chose a density point @xmath385 in the proof below : @xmath386 , thus @xmath283 maps @xmath387 to @xmath388 and every other @xmath6 a @xmath389-step towards @xmath388 .",
