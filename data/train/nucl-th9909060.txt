    "the non - relativistic constituent quark model ( nrcqm ) predicts a much richer baryon spectrum than that observed in @xmath2 scatterings . this arises the question of the existences of the  missing resonances \" .",
    "alternatively , it is argued that the  absence \" of those resonances might originate from their weak couplings to the @xmath3 channel .",
    "therefore , efforts are also made to search for signals of those  missing resonances \" in other decay channels , for instance , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc .",
    "this revives the study of vector meson ( @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) photo- and electroproduction near threshold in both experiment and theory .    the main feature in vector meson photoproduction is the dominant diffractive phenomenon at small momentum transfer . in the @xmath0 meson photoproduction ,",
    "it has been shown in the experimental measurement  @xcite and vector - meson - dominant model ( vdm ) calculation  @xcite , that the _ unnatural _ parity exchange contribution plays a dominant role over the _ natural _",
    "parity exchange from threshold @xmath14 gev to @xmath15 gev .",
    "meanwhile , deviations from the pure diffractive phenomenon are expected since contributions from the non - diffractive intermediate resonance excitations become important .    in this work ,",
    "a @xmath1 exchange mechanism is introduced to account for the _ unnatural _ parity exchange , while a pomeron exchange model by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite is included to describe the _ natural _ parity exchange .",
    "the commonly used couplings , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are employed for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 vertices , respectively , while an exponential form factor @xmath20 comes from the integrals over the spatial wavefunctions in the harmonic oscillator basis for these two vertices . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the momenta of the incoming photon and outgoing @xmath0 meson , respectively , in the c.m . system .",
    "@xmath23 mev is the only parameter introduced for the @xmath1 exchange terms . in the _ natural _ parity exchange model",
    ", the pomeron mediates the long range interaction between a confined quark and a nucleon , and behaves rather like a @xmath24 isoscalar photon .",
    "the only parameter @xmath25 , which describes the coupling strength of the pomeron to the constituent quark , is determined by experimental data at high energies . in this way , we believe that the _ natural _ and _ unnatural _ parity exchanges have been reasonably estimated .",
    "we emphasize that a reliable description of the non - resonance contributions at forward angles is the prerequisite for studying roles played by the _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonances .    for the _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonance contributions ,",
    "an effective lagrangian is introduced into the quark - vector - meson coupling in the quark model  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the quark and antiquark fields , respectively , and @xmath29 denotes the vector meson field .",
    "the two parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the vector and tensor couplings of the quark to the vector meson , respectively , and @xmath32 mev is the constituent quark mass .    in the @xmath33 symmetry limit , those low - lying contributing states with @xmath34 in the harmonic oscillator basis are listed in table  [ table-1 ] , while those excited states with @xmath35 are safely treated degenerate with @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that the moorhouse selection rule  @xcite has eliminated those states belonging to nrcqm representation @xmath37}$ ] from contributing .",
    "[ table-1 ]    .",
    "resonances contributing in the _ s_-channel , with their assignments in the @xmath33 symmetry limit .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are the masses and total widths of resonances which are taken from ref .  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the constraint on the two parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for the resonance contributions comes from the large angle behavior in the differential cross sections . at large angles",
    ", it is the _",
    "s_- and _ u_-channel resonance contributions that play dominant roles over the _ t_-channel contributions . to reproduce the bump structures observed in experiments  @xcite ,",
    "we find that @xmath40 and @xmath41 give an overall fitting for all the data available  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : total - x ] , the total cross section ( full curve ) calculated in this model is presented .",
    "the _ unnatural _",
    "parity exchange contribution is accounted for by the @xmath1 exchange ( dashed curve ) over a large energy regime . with the energy increasing ,",
    "the pomeron exchange ( dot - dashed ) , which accounts for the _ natural _ parity exchange contributions becomes more and more important , and finally dominates the cross sections at high energies .",
    "the inclusion of the pomeron exchange terms improves the previous calculations  @xcite significantly when the photon energies are above the resonance region ( from threshold to about 2.2 gev ) .",
    "the most interesting feature from the resonance contributions ( dotted curve ) is that , although the @xmath1 exchange plays a dominant role over a large energy regime , it is the resonance contributions that definitely dominate over the other two processes from threshold to about @xmath42 gev .",
    "this feature accounts for the flattened angular distributions near threshold observed in clas experiment  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] , the angular distributions for different energy scales are presented .",
    "explicitly , it shows that the _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonance contributions ( dotted curves ) produce the bump structures at large angles , while the @xmath1 plus pomeron exchange ( dashed curves ) account for the forward angle diffractive behaviors .",
    "the energy evolution of the large angle behavior is quite sensitive to the relative sign and strength between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which makes the model prediction absolutely non - trivial .",
    "we find that that the predicted angular distributions are in good agreement with the preliminary clas data  @xcite .            our predictions for the beam polarization asymmetries",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] .",
    "the dashed curves represent the asymmetries with only the _",
    "t_-channel exchange terms , namely , the @xmath1 and pomeron exchanges .",
    "it can be justified that when only pure _ unnatural _ or _ natural _ parity exchanges contribute to the amplitudes , the beam polarization asymmetries will be zero .",
    "this rule also holds when only the @xmath1 and pomeron exchanges contribute in @xmath43 . since here",
    "the @xmath1 exchange and pomeron exchange contribute to the real and imaginary amplitudes , respectively , no interfering terms ( real - imaginary components ) appear in the beam polarization asymmetries ( the beam asymmetry only involves the real - real or imaginary - imaginary interfering components ) .",
    "this feature makes the beam polarization asymmetry interesting since the _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonance interferences can be reflected by the non - zero asymmetries . with the _ s_- and _",
    "u_-channel resonance contributions included , the beam polarization asymmetries are shown by the full curves .",
    "we find that a clear nodal structure appears at about @xmath44 .",
    "also , a flattened behavior with very small asymmetries is also found in the forward angles between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "similar feature has been observed in the preliminary data from graal .",
    "the energy evolution of the asymmetries will provide a challenge for a model prediction .    in the @xmath33 symmetry limit",
    ", it shows that two resonances @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are assigned to representation @xmath49}$ ] with @xmath50 , play dominant roles over contributions from other states .",
    "the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] show the effects without contributions from @xmath47 .",
    "this dominating behavior can be accounted for by the non - vanishing longitudinal , and electro - like transitions at the meson coupling vertex . in comparison with @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ", the contributions from @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which belong to representation @xmath53}$ ] with @xmath50 , turn out to be quite small . in the quark model symmetry limit ,",
    "only the magnetic - like transition is permitted for these two states .",

    "notations are given in the text . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : target ] , the target polarization asymmetries ( full curve ) are shown at @xmath54 gev .",
    "the dashed curves represent the asymmetries from the _",
    "t_-channel exchanges , i.e. the @xmath1 plus pomeron exchange . in comparison with the full curves in which the resonance contributions are taken into account",
    ", we find that the resonance contributions play significant roles at large angles .",
    "interestingly , with the energy increasing , the interference between the @xmath1 and pomeron exchange determines the asymmetries at small angles while at large angles it is the resonance interference that plays a dominant role .",
    "the dotted curve shows the effects when the two  missing resonances \" are eliminated from contributing .",
    "it shows that at @xmath54 gev , the nodal structures at intermediate and large angles come from the interferences of the two  missing resonances \"",
    ". the target polarization asymmetry measurement might be able to provide signals for the existence of the two  missing resonances \" .",
    "in summary , we report an improved quark model approach to the @xmath0 meson photoproduction . with very limited number of parameters , all the available data in the low - energy region can be consistently reproduced .",
