    "when the heating timescale is much shorter than the radiative cooling timescale , the overpressure of the chromosphere pumps hot plasma into the newly reconnected coronal loops that emit strong emissions in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray ( sxr ) , a process called chromospheric evaporation @xcite .",

    "explosive evaporation took place not only in the cfr , but also in the ifr .",

    "<S> in this paper , we report our multiwavelength observations of the c4.2 circular - ribbon flare in active region ( ar ) 12434 on 2015 october 16 . </S>",
    "<S> the short - lived flare was associated with positive magnetic polarities and a negative polarity inside , as revealed by the photospheric line - of - sight magnetograms . </S>",
    "<S> such magnetic pattern is strongly indicative of a magnetic null point and spine - fan configuration in the corona . </S>",
    "<S> the flare was triggered by the eruption of a mini - filament residing in the ar , which produced the inner flare ribbon ( ifr ) and the southern part of a closed circular flare ribbon ( cfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the eruptive filament reached the null point , it triggered null point magnetic reconnection with the ambient open field and generated the bright cfr and a blowout jet . </S>",
    "<S> raster observations of the _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ iris _ ) show plasma upflow at speed of 35@xmath0120 km s@xmath1 in the fe xxi 1354.09  line ( @xmath2 ) and downflow at speed of 10@xmath060 km s@xmath1 in the si iv 1393.77  line ( @xmath3 ) at certain locations of the cfr and ifr during the impulsive phase of flare , indicating explosive chromospheric evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> coincidence of the single hxr source at 12@xmath025 kev with the ifr and calculation based on the thick - target model suggest that the explosive evaporation was most probably driven by nonthermal electrons .    online - only material : animations , color figures </S>"
