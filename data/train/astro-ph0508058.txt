    "the x - ray variability of radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ) measured to date is best characterised as a red - noise process , with a power - law psd of slope @xmath1 on short time - scales ( hours to days,@xcite ) . in the last few years , longer - time - scale monitoring of agn , on time - scales of weeks to years , with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) has revealed breaks in the psds , with the psd flattening to slopes @xmath2 below the break frequency ( e.g. @xcite ) , similar to the high - frequency breaks ( around @xmath3  hz ) observed in the psds of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) .",
    "comparison of the break frequencies ( or equivalently , time - scales ) with independent measures of black hole mass shows that they scale roughly linearly with mass from the time - scales observed in bhxrbs , albeit with some scatter @xcite .",
    "this remarkable connection with the x - ray variability properties of stellar mass black - holes raises the possibility that other properties of these sources are similar .",
    "for example , since bhxrbs show a range of states with different x - ray spectral and variability properties ( see @xcite for a review ) , we can ask , do agn show a similar range of states ?    narrow line seyfert  1 ( nls  1 ) are often compared with bhxrbs in the high / soft state or very high states , since they show steep power - law x - ray spectra @xmath4 @xcite , similar to the steep power - laws observed in the high / soft state of bhxrbs  kev , which would generally not be observed in the x - ray spectra of agn , due to their lower disk temperatures ] . on the other hand , broad line seyfert galaxies have harder x - ray spectra ( @xmath5 ) and so have been compared with bhxrbs in the low / hard state . this dichotomy",
    "is also reflected in the x - ray variability of nls  1 and broad line agn , with high - luminosity nls  1 showing typically larger variability on short time - scales ( hours ) compared to broad line seyferts , which show weaker variability with increasing luminosity @xcite .",
    "comparison of psd break time - scales with independent estimates of black hole mass suggested that this difference in variability amplitude may be due to a systematically shorter break time - scale in the psds of nls  1 @xcite , consistent with the interpretation that nls  1 occupy the high / soft state , which shows a higher psd break frequency than the low / hard state ( @xmath6  hz versus @xmath7few  hz ) .",
    "more recently , using the latest revised estimates of black hole masses @xcite have shown that the break time - scales of broad line seyferts are consistent with scaling from the high / soft state , in which case the relative difference in break time - scales may reflect a more gradual dependence of time - scale on e.g. accretion rate , rather than a sharp transition between high / soft and low / hard accretion states ( see also @xcite ) . it is not clear if the normalisations of nls  1 psds are also systematically higher than those of broad line seyferts .",
    "the comparison with bhxrbs is more complicated here , since only the power - law continuum is significantly variable in high / soft state bhxrbs @xcite so the amplitude of variability ( i.e. psd normalisation ) is reduced by the presence of the constant blackbody which would not be observed in agn .",
    "a more clear - cut test of the existence of different states in agn is the shape of the broadband psd , this is because the low / hard and high / soft states in bhxrbs show a clear and simple difference in psd shape .",
    "high / soft state psds show power continuing below the break with an unbroken power - law slope @xmath2 down to very low frequencies ( @xmath8  hz , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "low / hard state psds show a second break : a cut off in the power ( to slope 0 ) below @xmath9  hz , so that there is only significant power over about a decade range in frequency @xcite .",
    "the best evidence for a low / hard state psd shape in an agn has been obtained for the broad line seyfert  1 ngc  3783 @xcite ; although the precise low - frequency shape is unclear , the psd does appear to flatten and is not consistent with an unbroken slope of -1 at the 98 per cent confidence level .",
    "in contrast , the best - quality broadband agn psd measured to date is for the nls  1 ngc  4051 , which clearly showed a continuation of power to low frequencies with slope @xmath10 over a @xmath11-decade range , consistent with a high / soft state interpretation .",
    "a similar result is also obtained for mcg6 - 30 - 15 @xcite .    in this paper , we present the broadband psd of a broad line seyfert  1.5 , ngc  3227 , emission in the mean spectrum is only 1900  km  s@xmath12 ( hence the seyfert  1.5 classification ) this is probably due to contamination by a constant narrow emission line , since the fwhm of the h@xmath13 line in the rms - spectrum is @xmath14  km  s@xmath12 @xcite . ] which shows that this agn has a high / soft state psd shape despite possessing an intrinsically hard x - ray continuum ( @xmath0 , ) and an apparently low accretion rate ( few per cent eddington ) .",
    "we also show that the psd of the seyfert  2 ngc  5506 , recently identified as an obscured nls  1 @xcite is consistent with a high / soft state shape , but has significantly lower normalisation than the psd of ngc  3227 .",
    "both agn also show different energy dependences of the psd normalisation , with ngc  3227 showing increasing amplitude of variability at lower energies while ngc  5506 shows little energy dependence of variability . in combination , these results show that the high / soft and low / hard state dichotomy can not be simply applied to describing nls  1 and broad line seyferts , at least in regard to their variability properties .",
    "we have monitored ngc  3227 from 1999 jan 2 to the present ( data obtained up to 2005 feb 24 is used here ) , and ngc  5506 from 1996 apr 23 to 2002 may 20 as part of our program to measure the broadband psds of agn . in order to efficiently sample variability over a broad range of time - scales , we observe our targets using 1  ksec snapshots with the proportional counter array , which are obtained over a range of ( roughly evenly - spaced ) sampling intervals . until the end of 2000 february ,",
    "_ rxte _ observed the sources using a combination of twice - daily , daily , bi - weekly and also monthly monitoring ( see @xcite , henceforth ump02 , for psds of several agn , including ngc  5506 , constructed using this data ) . from 2000 march to 2001 february , _ rxte _ carried out weekly observations , and also carried out intensive 4-times - daily monitoring of each agn for two months , in order to better constrain the psd on intermediate time - scales .",
    "then , from 2001 march to 2002 february ( for ngc  5506 ) , and up until the present in the case of ngc  3227 , the sampling rate of long - term monitoring increased to every two days , in order to better pin down the lower - frequency shape of the psd , which is heavily influenced by aliasing from higher frequencies ( e.g. see ump02 ) .    in order to constrain the short - term variability and measure the psd at high frequencies , we use long - look observations , of @xmath7days duration . for ngc  3227 , we obtained an archival _ rxte _ observation of @xmath15  d duration . for ngc  5506 ,",
    "as noted in ump02 , our original ` long - look ' observation was poorly sampled , so that it was only suitable for use in measuring the psd at relatively high frequencies ( @xmath16  hz , i.e. time - scales less than an _ rxte _ orbit ) .",
    "therefore in ump02 we also used an archival long - look observation with the me instrument on board _ exosat _ to constrain the psd at frequencies @xmath17@xmath18  hz , and we also use the same observation here ( see ump02 for further details ) .",
    "however , subsequently a somewhat short ( @xmath19  d ) but well - sampled _ rxte _ long - look observation ( 2001 december ) has become available , which we also use to constrain the psd over the same frequency range as the _ exosat _ data .",
    "we summarise the observations used in this paper in table  [ obstab ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     despite the different methods used to estimate black hole mass , it is worth noting that the data points which lie systematically above the high / soft state line ( i.e. with shorter break time - scales than expected ) consist of both reverberation - mapped and non - reverberation - mapped agn . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the deviation from linear scaling with cyg  x-1 may be a function of accretion rate .",
    "we examine this possibility in fig .",
    "[ mdottime ] , which shows the ratio of the observed psd break time - scale to that expected from linear scaling with the high / soft state break time - scale in cyg  x-1 , versus the ratio of bolometric luminosity , @xmath20 to the eddington rate for the given black hole mass ( @xmath21  erg  s@xmath12  m@xmath22 ) , which is a proxy for the accretion rate ( in eddington units ) , assuming a constant efficiency .",
    "the bolometric luminosities are obtained from the literature and are generally estimated by integrating the available spectral energy distributions of the agn ( see table  [ bkmasstab ] for references ) . however , since no such estimates exist for mrk  766 or ngc  5506 , we estimated the bolometric luminosity by applying a bolometric correction factor of 36.6 to the 2 - 10  kev x - ray luminosities .",
    "] ( the 2 - 10  kev x - ray luminosity of ngc  5506 is estimated using the _ rxte _ data , while for mrk  766 it is obtained from @xcite ) .",
    "there does appear to be an overall trend for higher accretion rate agn to show shorter break time - scales , in agreement with the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "however , ngc  3227 and ngc  5506 show break time - scales systematically shorter than other agn of similar mass and accretion rate .",
    "note that the errors due to uncertainty in the mass are not accounted for in the figure . since mass affects both @xmath23 and the break time - scale ratio , the errors on both axes are correlated : if the assumed mass is increased , data points move proportionately down and to the left , if it is decreased , data points move up and to the right . in this way , ngc  3227 and ngc  5506 could be made more consistent with the other agn if the current masses for ngc  3227 and ngc  5506 are overestimated",
    ". however , it seems unlikely that all the agn data points can be made consistent with a single break - time - scale ratio in this way , because to do so would require making a high accretion - rate agn such as ark  564 even more super - eddington than is already implied by its small black hole mass .",
    "cyg  x-1 transitions to the high / soft state at @xmath24  @xmath23 @xcite , and its bolometric luminosity does not seem to increase much above this value ( e.g. see @xcite ) . thus if cyg  x-1 in the high / soft state were placed on the same plot as the agn ( at a break time - scale ratio of 1 , by construction )",
    ", it would be consistent with the agn data points at similar accretion rates .",
    "the different energy - dependence of psd normalisations in ngc  3227 and ngc  5506 may result from the presence of different constant emission components in these sources , or intrinsically different spectral variability .",
    "for example if the spectral shape of the variable continuum is not itself intrinsically variable , a constant component with a harder spectrum than the variable continuum component could dilute the fractional amplitude of variability at harder energies , to produce an overall reduction in psd amplitude with increasing energy , as observed in ngc  3227 .",
    "evidence for constant hard components can be seen in several other agn , including ngc  5506 , using the ` flux - flux plot ' method of spectral analysis ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . in ngc  5506 , this constant component , which may be associated with disk reflection in other agn @xcite , is relatively weak , which might explain the weak energy dependence of the psd normalisation in this source .",
    "consistent with this possibility , @xcite find no evidence for an accretion disk reflection component in the x - ray spectrum of ngc  5506 .",
    "note that , since any constant component in ngc  5506 is probably weak , the relatively small psd normalisation observed in ngc  5506 compared to ngc  3227 is likely to be intrinsic to the varying continuum , and not simply due to dilution by constant components of different strength .",
    "it is possible that the much stronger energy - dependence of the psd normalisation observed in ngc  3227 is due to a stronger constant reflection component in this source . to check this possibility , in fig .",
    "[ fvfplot ] we show a flux - flux plot ( see @xcite for details of the method ) for ngc  3227 , made with the 3 - 5  kev and 7 - 15  kev monitoring data used here ( but excluding the period four months on either side of the peak absorption of the 2001 event ) . unlike the ngc  5506 data , which is well fitted by a linear plus constant model ( see @xcite ) , the ngc  3227 data is best fitted with a power - law of index @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for 8 degrees of freedom ) with no constant component required .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this simple power - law description of the flux - flux plot corresponds to intrinsic spectral pivoting of the varying continuum about an energy of a few hundred kev .",
    "therefore the energy dependence of psd normalisation in ngc  3227 is intrinsic to the varying continuum , and not caused by a constant hard component . in other words , the flux changes ( at least on long time - scales ) observed in all bands are caused primarily by the pivoting of the continuum , with the relatively larger changes at softer energies being a natural result of this effect .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the flux variability observed in ngc  3227 results largely from spectral pivoting , the variations in the total luminosity integrated to high energies should be less than the variations we observe .",
    "we note that ngc  4051 also shows spectral pivoting @xcite and a relatively large amplitude of variability compared to other agn @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these large amplitude variations may simply be an effect of the spectral pivoting , combined with the relatively low , 2 - 10  kev energy band which we use to observe the varying continuum .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity variations in these agn may not be much different from those in other agn , in which case the explanation for the observed differences may lie with the origin of spectral pivoting .",
    "@xcite point out that spectral pivoting can arise when the variability is driven by seed photons from the disk , which compton - cool the corona . on the other hand ,",
    "if the variability is driven mainly by variations in the corona itself , feedback effects due to disk heating may lead to a constant spectral shape .",
    "therefore the energy dependence and amplitude of psd normalisation may give clues to the ultimate origin of the variability , either in the disk or the corona .",
    "for completeness , we also note that gravitational light bending models suggested to explain the weak variability of the reflection component in mcg6 - 30 - 15 and other agn @xcite , could also produce behaviour in a flux - flux plot which mimics spectral pivoting ( see @xcite ) . for this model to apply in ngc  3227 however",
    ", the reflection component would need to be well hidden ( e.g. strongly smeared out ) , since no evidence for a broad iron line feature is seen in the x - ray spectrum , even at low continuum flux levels ( e.g. @xcite ) , where the equivalent width of such features is greatest in light bending models @xcite .    finally , we point out that the observed psd normalisations of ngc  5506 and ngc  3227 bracket the psd normalisation of cyg  x-1 ( which is @xmath27 in the 8 - 13  kev band which is undiluted by the constant thermal emission , @xcite ) .",
    "the range of agn psd normalisations appears to be intrinsic to the variability process , and not simply due to the presence of constant components of different strengths .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the psd normalisation is correlated with parameters such as accretion rate or black hole mass , although the similarity between the long - term variability amplitudes of ngc  4051 and ngc  3227 ( with very different spectral shapes , masses and accretion rates ) would suggest that it is nt . therefore , after taking account of stochastic variations , some of the scatter in relations between short - term variability and optical line width @xcite , or black hole mass @xcite may be due to intrinsic differences in psd normalisation , caused by some currently unknown mechanism .",
    "it is commonly assumed that nls  1 are analogous to bhxrbs in the high / soft or very high states , whereas ` normal ' broad line seyferts are compared with the low / hard state .",
    "ngc  3227 shows that this assumption is too simplistic , at least with regard to using the variability as a diagnostic of the ` state ' .",
    "there may indeed be a tendency for nls  1 to show high / soft state psds ( e.g. ngc  4051 is the best example to date , @xcite ) , but broad line seyferts can also show high / soft state psds .",
    "this is not surprising , since the transition from the low / hard to high / soft state in bhxrbs occurs on average at about 2 per cent of the eddington luminosity @xcite , similar to the eddington fraction estimated for ngc  3227 , assuming the reverberation - mapped mass of @xmath28  m@xmath29 @xcite . in fact , many nearby broad line agn exceed this eddington fraction ( e.g. see table  3 in @xcite ) , so it is likely that many luminous broad line agn are found in the high / soft or very high states .",
    "the analogy of nls  1 with the high / soft state in bhxrbs is made because both nls  1 and high / soft state bhxrbs typically show steep power - law continuum spectra , with photon indices @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , ngc  3227 shows an intrinsically hard continuum with photon index @xmath0 @xcite , saturating at @xmath30 at high fluxes [ c.f .",
    "ngc  4051 which saturates at @xmath31 @xcite ] , with its flux - flux plot showing no evidence for additional strong reflection which would flatten an otherwise steep primary continuum .",
    "therefore , the variability of ngc  3227 demonstrates that continuum spectral shape and psd shape are not simply correlated .",
    "a source may show a high / soft state psd together with a low / hard state x - ray spectrum .",
    "we have used x - ray monitoring of the seyfert galaxies ngc  3227 and ngc  5506 over a broad range of time - scales to construct broadband psds for these agn , and demonstrated that both psds are consistent with being the same shape as psds of bhxrbs in the high / soft state .",
    "we further rule out the possibility of a low / hard state psd in ngc  3227 , so that , together with mcg6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , it represents the second clear example ( after ngc  4051 ) of a high / soft state psd in an agn .",
    "the normalisation of the psd of ngc  3227 is significantly larger than that of ngc  5506 , and unlike ngc  5506 , ngc  3227 shows a strong energy dependence of psd normalisation , with greater variability at lower energies . both the energy dependence of normalisation and the large variability amplitude may be a result of spectral pivoting of the power - law continuum of ngc  3227 at high energies , also similar to ngc  4051 .",
    "however , the main result to come out of this work is the fact that ngc  3227 , _ unlike ngc  4051 _ is a broad line seyfert  1.5 with an intrinsically hard x - ray spectrum , yet it has a broadband x - ray variability psd reminiscent of bhxrbs in the high / soft state .",
    "the combination of a low / hard - state - like x - ray spectrum with a psd reminiscent of the high / soft state suggests that the current nomenclature for the various states is inappropriate",
    ". therefore it may be necessary to refer to separate variability and spectral states , which are connected in some complex but as yet unknown way .",

    "<S> this result demonstrates that , at least where variability is concerned , broad line seyferts with hard x - ray spectra ( photon index @xmath0 ) are not simply the analogues of the low / hard state in bhxrbs , and the dichotomy of nls  1 and broad line seyferts can not be simply interpreted in terms of the two states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the psd normalisation in ngc  3227 is strongly energy dependent , with larger variability amplitudes at lower energies , unlike ngc  5506 which shows little energy - dependence of variability . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this difference is caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in ngc  3227 at high energies , which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in the 2 - 10  kev band in this agn . using the new psd data and new results in the literature , we replot the psd break time - scale versus mass plot for all agn with psd breaks measured so far , and demonstrate that higher accretion - rate agn appear to have relatively shorter break time - scales for their black hole mass than lower - accretion rate agn .    x - rays : galaxies  galaxies : active  galaxies : seyfert  galaxies : individual : ngc  3227  galaxies : individual : ngc  5506  methods : statistical </S>"
