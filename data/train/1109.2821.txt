    "property a is a geometric condition on metric spaces introduced by yu @xcite for studying coarse embeddability into hilbert spaces .",
    "it amounts to a non - equivariant generalization of amenability . among many important consequences of property a are the validity of the coarse baum - connes conjecture ( which , in turn , implies the strong novikov conjecture ) , the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture on the existence of positive scalar curvature , and gromov s zero - in - the - spectrum conjecture .",
    "it is the work of higson and roe @xcite that characterized property a in terms of analytical conditions , which are similar to classical conditions characterizing amenable groups .",
    "since amenable groups are of property a , and they can also be characterized by vanishing of certain bounded cohomology groups , higson proposed to characterize property a groups by cohomological conditions .",
    "several related results in this direction have recently appeared in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in @xcite brodzki ,",
    "niblo , and wright give a characterization of property a for metric spaces via the construction of an asymptotically invariant cohomology theory , while in @xcite douglas and nowak give a partial characterization of property a in terms of bounded cohomology .",
    "the program in @xcite was completed by brodzki , niblo , nowak , and wright in @xcite using bounded cohomology with certain coefficients .",
    "in particular , they show that @xmath0 has property a if and only if for every appropriate coefficient module @xmath3 , @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "monod has obtained a similar characterization in @xcite , where property a is further shown to be equivalent to the relative injectivity of a class of banach modules associated to the group .    in the current paper",
    ", we expand upon the methods of @xcite by examining the relative bounded cohomology of the countable discrete group @xmath0 with respect to a finite family of subgroups , @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath6 . for each choice of coefficient module",
    ", there is a long - exact sequence relating @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the bounded cohomology of the subgroups @xcite .",
    "we then define relative property a for @xmath0 equipped with a left - invariant proper metric relative to a finite family of subgroups @xmath1 .",
    "this is given as a relative version of yu s original definition .",
    "several equivalent formulations of relative property a are developed , including analogues of amenable actions on a compact space and reiter s condition .",
    "most importantly , @xmath0 has relative property a with respect to @xmath1 , if and only if for any @xmath9-geometric @xmath0-@xmath10 module @xmath3 , the map @xmath11 is surjective . in conjunction with the results of @xcite , we arrive at the following theorem .",
    "suppose that the countable discrete group @xmath0 has relative property a with respect to the finite family of subgroups @xmath1 . then @xmath0 has property a if and only if each of the subgroups @xmath12 has property a.    in particular , this generalizes the theorems of ozawa @xcite and dadarlat - guentner @xcite for relatively hyperbolic groups , and is similar in spirit to osin s results on finite asymptotic dimension @xcite .",
    "the following theorem describes conditions that ensure relative property a.    suppose that a finitely generated discrete group @xmath0 acts cocompactly on a uniformly discrete metric space with bounded geometry , @xmath13 . fix a family of representatives @xmath14 of orbits of @xmath0 in @xmath15 , and let @xmath1 be the family of subgroups occurring as the stabilizers of elements of @xmath14 . if @xmath16 has property a , then @xmath0 has relative property a with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "a corollary to the theorem is the following result on a complex of groups .",
    "suppose the finitely generated discrete group @xmath0 is the fundamental group of a developable finite dimensional complex of groups whose development is a locally finite complex with property a. then @xmath0 has relative property a with respect to the vertex groups .",
    "in particular , if each vertex group has property a , then @xmath0 has property a.    this also gives an extension of a theorem of @xcite , where it is shown that a finite dimensional cat(@xmath17 ) cube complex has property a. we have the following corollary which generalizes a theorem of bell @xcite and guentner - tessera - yu @xcite for property a groups .",
    "suppose that the finitely generated group @xmath0 acts cocompactly on a locally finite , finite dimensional cat(@xmath17 ) cube complex . if any vertex stabilizer has property a , then @xmath0 has property a.    by specializing the definition of relative property a , we formulate a notion of relative amenability .",
    "a countable discrete group @xmath0 is relatively amenable to a finite family of subgroups @xmath1 if there is a @xmath0-invariant mean on @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the disjoint of all @xmath20 for @xmath12 .",
    "our characterization of relative property a gives a cohomological characterization of relative amenability as well .",
    "this allows one to determine amenability for a group in terms of group actions on metric spaces , via a corollary to theorem [ thm : relamenactiononspace ] which states the following :    suppose the countable discrete group @xmath0 acts cocompactly on a uniformly discrete metric space with bounded geometry .",
    "if the space is amenable in the sense of block and weinberger @xcite , and any point stabilizer is amenable , then @xmath0 is amenable .",
    "we anticipate that this will provide many new examples of amenable groups .",
    "we would also like to point out that from the works of guentner - kaminker @xcite and ozawa @xcite property a for countable discrete groups is equivalent to the exactness of the group @xcite .",
    "we will discuss a relative version of the exactness in a future publication .",
    "we now outline what will follow .",
    "in section 2 we recall the definition of property a for uniformly discrete metric spaces of bounded geometry .",
    "we then review the bounded cohomology interpretation of property a given in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we review relative bounded cohomology and the bieri - eckmann type long - exact sequence relating relative and absolute bounded cohomologies @xcite .    in section 4",
    "we introduce the notion of relative property a. this is based on the existence of a countable set @xmath21 on which the group acts cofinitely , with the elements of @xmath1 and their conjugates appearing as the point stabilizers .",
    "we then give several equivalent descriptions of relative property a. our notion of relative property a has the benefit that if @xmath1 consists of only the trivial subgroup , our definition reduces to the statement that @xmath0 itself has property a. from the work of ozawa @xcite , groups acting cofinitely on uniformly fine hyperbolic graphs provide examples of groups satisfying relative property a with respect to the vertex stabilizers .",
    "( in particular , this includes relatively hyperbolic groups , amalgamated free products , and hnn extensions . )    in section 5 we give a cohomological characterization for relative property a. in the case that each of the subgroups are of property a , a long - exact sequence argument implies property a for the group .",
    "we show that a finitely generated group acting cocompactly on a property a metric space has relative property a with respect to the point stabilizers .",
    "it is known by @xcite that locally finite , finite dimensional cat(@xmath17 ) cube complexes have property a , so that a group acting cocompactly on such a complex has relative property a with respect to the vertex stabilizers .",
    "consequently , if each of the vertex stabilizers have property a then the group itself has property a.    finally , in section 6 we propose a definition of relative amenability .",
    "our notion of relative amenability , in the case of a single subgroup , reduces to monod and popa s notion of co - amenability @xcite .",
    "it is also equivalent to the amenability of the quasi - regular representation of @xmath0 on @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a cohomological characterization for relative amenability is obtained by specializing that for relative property a. it is then shown that if a group is relatively amenable with respect to a family of amenable subgroups , then the group is amenable .",

    "<S> in particular a relative bounded cohomological characterization shows that if @xmath0 has property a relative to a family of subgroups @xmath1 and if each @xmath2 has property a , then @xmath0 has property a. this result leads to new classes of groups that have property a. in particular , groups are of property a if they act cocompactly on locally finite property a spaces of bounded geometry with any stabilizer of property a. specializing the definition of relative property a , an analogue definition of relative amenability for discrete groups are introduced and similar results are obtained . </S>"
