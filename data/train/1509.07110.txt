    "since the 2012 discovery of enhanced high - temperature superconductivity in single - layer fese / srtio@xmath0  @xcite , the quest to reproduce , understand , and extend this finding remains urgent .",
    "single - layer fese weakly coupled to bilayer graphene is non - superconducting down to 2.2 k  @xcite , but when deposited on srtio@xmath0(001 ) , exhibits a superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 up to 65 k  @xcite or 109 k  @xcite .",
    "efforts to elucidate the microscopic mechanisms behind this transformation have presently led to divergent viewpoints  @xcite . at the crux of the debate",
    "is whether single - layer fese / srtio@xmath0 exemplifies a novel pairing mechanism involving cross - interface phonon coupling , or whether it shares a common electronic mechanism with other iron chalcogenides already seen .",
    "indications of the first viewpoint were brought forth by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements , which revealed that the primary electronic bands possess faint `` shake - off '' bands offset by 100 mev  @xcite .",
    "the replication of primary band features without momentum offset suggests an electron - boson coupling sharply peaked at @xmath11 @xmath12 0 .",
    "the boson was initially hypothesized to be an o phonon mode and subsequently observed on bare srtio@xmath0(001 )  @xcite .",
    "model calculations have demonstrated that phonons can enhance spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing in fese  @xcite .",
    "others have argued that phonons alone can account for a significant portion of the high @xmath10  @xcite .    an alternative",
    "but possibly complementary viewpoint is that electron doping underlies the primary enhancement of @xmath10 in single - layer fese / srtio@xmath0 .",
    "early experiments observed that as - grown films become superconducting only after a vacuum annealing process  @xcite .",
    "this procedure presumably generates interfacial o vacancies donating electron carriers  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments showed that multilayer fese , which does not exhibit replica bands from coupling to srtio@xmath0 phonons , can still develop superconductivity ( @xmath10 up to 48 k suggested by arpes ) when coated with k atoms  @xcite .",
    "two observations from these latter experiments are crucial .",
    "first , the dome - shaped evolution of @xmath10 with doping refocuses attention on electronic ( spin / orbital ) mechanisms of pairing  @xcite .",
    "second , the enhanced @xmath10 emerges from a parent , bulk nematic phase , characterized in multilayer fese by a small orthorhombic distortion  @xcite and a large splitting of the fe @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands  @xcite .",
    "nematic order , defined more generally as broken rotational symmetry with preserved translational symmetry , is a hallmark of the parent phase of iron - based superconductors .",
    "importantly , both spin and orbital fluctuations that are candidate pairing glues can condense into parent nematic order  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 @xmath12 0 nematic fluctuations that extend beyond phase boundaries can enhance @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism operates in any pairing channel , with increased effectiveness in a 2d system  @xcite .",
    "recent dft calculations have shown that bulk and single - layer fese exhibit a propensity towards shearing , but that strong binding to cubic srtio@xmath0 suppresses this lattice instability  @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to ask whether in addition to suppressing nematic order , this binding may push the heterostructure closer to a nematic quantum critical point , with intensified fluctuations .    to investigate the possible role of nematicity , we use scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) imaging . by generating scattering through moderate disorder ,",
    "quasiparticle attributes such as spin / orbital / valley texture , or the superconducting order parameter , are manifested in selection rules that underlie the interference patterns .",
    "stm also affords dual real- and momentum - space visualization of electronic states within nanoscale regions .",
    "previous stm works have uncovered @xmath132 electronic patterns in parent ca(fe@xmath14co@xmath15)@xmath16as@xmath16",
    "@xcite , laofeas  @xcite , nafeas  @xcite , and superconducting orthorhombic fese  @xcite .",
    "in addition , remnant nematic signatures were detected in the nominally tetragonal phases of nafeas  @xcite and fese@xmath17te@xmath18  @xcite._these latter observations motivate our present investigation .",
    "can local disorder or anisotropic perturbations pin nanoscale patches of otherwise - fluctuating nematicity in single - layer fese / srtio@xmath0 , signaling proximate nematic quantum criticality ? or is the heterostructure too far from a nematic phase boundary for fluctuations to persist and boost @xmath10 ? _",
