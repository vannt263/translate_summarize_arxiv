    "<S> we analyze _ citeulike _ , an online collaborative tagging system where users bookmark and annotate scientific papers . such a system can be naturally represented as a tripartite graph whose nodes represent papers , users and tags connected by individual tag assignments . </S>",
    "<S> the semantics of tags is studied here , in order to uncover the hidden relationships between tags . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the clustering coefficient reflects the semantical patterns among tags , providing useful ideas for the designing of more efficient methods of data classification and spam detection ..    the recent development of the world wide web is characterized by a growing number of online social communities . in many such cases , </S>",
    "<S> individuals provide bits of information - about either their tastes , opinions or interests - and software applications gather and organize them into a database , allowing the browsing of the whole information collected so . </S>",
    "<S> a class of such collaborative systems focusses on collecting users online bookmarks with either a general approach or a more specialized one . in particular , some websites have been recently born to store user  generated scientific bibliographies .    in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> the elementary contribution , the `` post '' , is made of three ingredients : a user , an article and an annotation of it by a number of tags chosen by users . in exchange for this voluntary contribution </S>",
    "<S> , a user can browse others bibliographies and annotations . </S>",
    "<S> tags are an alternative classification method with respect to traditional taxonomies , where items belong to `` taxa '' represented as a tree  like set of categories : here , each category contains in turn a number of more specialized sub  categories , and so on until the desired resolution of classification is been reached . instead , in tagging systems items are tagged by users characterized by diverse tagging strategies depending on a number of individual variables . </S>",
    "<S> the set of tag  resource relations in such a community is called a `` folksonomy '' .    </S>",
    "<S> such communities are now extremely popular , storing hundreds of thousands posts and more . </S>",
    "<S> the tagging system we analyze here , _ citeulike _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , has been built , at the time of our survey , by ca . </S>",
    "<S> 180000 references annotated by ca . </S>",
    "<S> 48000 tags supplied by ca . </S>",
    "<S> 6000 users . </S>",
    "<S> our dataset includes about 550000 `` tag assignments '' : each assignment is a t - uple ( user , resource , tag ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of chronologically ordered tags , in particular , can be interpreted as a stream of words , to which one can applies the traditional statistical text analysis to uncover how human behavior affects it .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical analysis of word occurrences in a written text has shown that word frequencies are power  law distributed according to the zipf s law , according to which a large number of words appears in a text only a few times , while a few words occur orders of magnitude more often @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such feature has been modeled by many models based on the preferential attachment principle , that is , the assumption that authors employ already used words with a probability proportional to the current word frequency . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been observed that the rate of new words decrease with the text  </S>",
    "<S> length @xcite , that is , the number of distinct word @xmath0 in a text of length @xmath1 scale as @xmath2 with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , models in literature assume that new words are introduced at a constant growth rate , so that their total number , i.e. the vocabulary , is a linear constant of the total number of words ( both new or repeated ones ) used so far @xcite .    yet , to discover the semantical properties of _ citeulike _ , one rather represents it by means of the network formalism , which proved fruitful in the analysis of many natural and social phenomena involving unsupervised interacting units : in a network perspective , elementary interacting agents or objects are represented by nodes , interactions by edges connecting them </S>",
    "<S> . the widespread success of such approach has been triggered by the discovery that many networks instances one encounters in reality share common statistical properties with no external tuning . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the degree @xmath4 , that is , the number of edges pointing to a node , follows in many cases a broad distribution @xmath5 with long tail decaying algebraically as @xmath6 with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> if edges have varying intensities , each of them is attached a weight @xmath8 representing its intensity ; accordingly , a node is characterized by its @xmath9 , equal to the sum of the weights of edges pointing to it . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of @xmath10 , too , is power  </S>",
    "<S> law distributed in many real weighted network instances . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore many such networks exhibit a strong transitivity , i.e. with high probability , the neighbors of a node are themselves connected by an edge , with respect to purely random realization of a network with equal number of nodes and links . </S>",
    "<S> networks sharing the above properties are currently named `` complex networks '' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the network approach has also been recently adopted to analyze the semantical structure of tagging systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tags can be represented by networks in different ways , in order to study how the behavior of users maps into the dynamical or topological features . </S>",
    "<S> a more recent stream of research deals with the organization of tags , which are implicitly linked by hierarchical and logical associations emerging despite the diversity of users as their number is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying semantical organization of tags reveals the dominant trends within a tagging community and allows to improve its navigability . </S>",
    "<S> recently , algorithms have been introduced in order to infer a taxonomy of tags from a folksonomy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical properties we observed in the _ citeulike _ data are consistent with the findings obtained in similar surveys , confirming that tags in collaborative systems form complex networks indeed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have investigated how the underlying semantics of tags reflects on the topology of the network .    as a matter of facts , </S>",
    "<S> tags provided by users come with no explicit hierarchy beside the chronological ordering , leading authors to analyze the stream of tags as a text  like sequence of words . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the time  ordered sequence of tags displays statistical properties already observed in written texts , such as the fat  tails in the word frequency distributions or the sub - linear vocabulary growth .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis confirms the sub - linear vocabulary growth observed in written texts . </S>",
    "<S> the number of distinct tags @xmath11 introduced by users after @xmath12 assignments grows approximately as @xmath13 , as shown in figure [ sublinear ] although the pace is slightly smaller than in other collaborative tagging systems already surveyed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of tags , too , reported in [ wordsfreq ] , reminds that of words observed in written texts , algebraically decaying according to the zipf s law @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the sole frequency of tags as a function of time does not convey much information about the semantics , although it reflects the different centrality of associated concepts in the underlying knowledge organization . to investigate tag pair relations </S>",
    "<S> , one has to represent the unit elements of a tagging system as nodes of a network .    </S>",
    "<S> the dataset we focus on can be naturally represented as a tri  partite network , where each node represents either a user @xmath14 , a resource @xmath15 or a tag @xmath12 ; if a tag assignment @xmath16 exists , an edge is drawn from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , and from @xmath15 to @xmath12 . since in a single user s </S>",
    "<S> post a resource can be tagged more than once , one post can correspond to multiple tag assignments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although efficient algorithm have been developed to analyzed such tri  partite network @xcite , the heterogeneity of nodes discourages in general the application of traditional network methods , mainly conceived to deal with network connections representing peer - to - peer relationships . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to study how tags are organized we chose to project the tri  partite networks on the tag space . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the tag co  occurrence network we study is composed by nodes representing tags only , between which an undirected edge of weight @xmath8 is drawn if @xmath8 distinct resources are labeled by both tags .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting network displays some of the typical features of weighted scale  free networks . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the distribution of the sum @xmath17 of the weights of edges pointing to a given node , or the _ strength _ of the node : such distribution @xmath18 , plotted in figure [ strength - dist ] , exhibits a clear power  </S>",
    "<S> law decay @xmath19 , with @xmath20 for large values of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the heterogeneity of the observed nodes weights does not necessarily reflects the centrality of corresponding concepts , that are supposed to be assigned together with a wider range of more specialized concepts , in the underlying hierarchy of tags . </S>",
    "<S> as it has been already shown @xcite , reshuffling the tag assignment in order to destroy the logical association among words does not change dramatically the shape of @xmath18 , which proves that the @xmath21 heterogeneity is more a consequence of frequency distribution broadness than of the varying roles of concepts in the semantical organization of the whole vocabulary .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the tag co  occurrence network unveils some semantical feature of the underlying ontology if , instead of focussing on the properties of single nodes , one turns to the inspection of quantities involving its environment . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such is represented by the analysis of the neighbor average degree @xmath22 of nodes with degree @xmath4 , where the degree is the number of incoming edges of a node .    in our study </S>",
    "<S> we examined instead the clustering properties of the tag co  occurrence network through the clustering coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> such coefficient @xmath23 counts the average density of triangles involving nodes with degree @xmath4 or , in other words , the probability that the nearest neighbors of a node with degree @xmath4 are in turn connected one to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this reads    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is 1 if a link exists between @xmath26 and @xmath27 and 0 otherwise , and @xmath28 is the frequency of nodes with degree @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity has been found to characterize most complex networks found in nature and society , where it takes substantially larger values with respect to a purely random networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the clustering coefficient are often associated to the hierarchical organization of nodes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the clustering coefficient appears to encode a signature of semantical relations between words . as represented in figure [ clustering - real ] </S>",
    "<S> , the clustering coefficient @xmath23 in _ citeulike _ decays algebraically for large values of the degree @xmath4 , according to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the clustering value displays an apparent fluctuation at @xmath30 . by inspecting the nodes corresponding to such value </S>",
    "<S> , one discovers that the sharp rise taking place at al @xmath30 corresponds to a non  existing resource labelled by @xmath31 distinct uncorrelated randomly chosen tags , which mimics the a spam contribution to the collaborative systems .    </S>",
    "<S> one is led thus to conjecture that the overall semantical organization of concept represented by tags is encoded in a characteristic behavior of the clustering coefficient @xmath23 , so that tags assigned in a semantically inconsistent way fall far away from this behavior . to verify such conjecture , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed the same statistical analysis after removing from the data set the tag assignments related to the spam  like page . as shown in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ clustering - real ] , after the removal the clustering coefficient follows a more regular behavior , confirming that the strong fluctuation observed above was due indeed to the presence of a single meaningless set of assignments involving a single resource . </S>",
    "<S> tags assigned only to the spam resource form a complete co  occurrence network , so that their clustering coefficient is equal to @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the behavior of clustering coefficient of the tag co  occurrence networks can be used as a test for models representing the tag semantical organization or , equivalently , how users choose tags when annotating a resource . as noted in literature @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , users typically use tags hierarchically , labelling a resource by tags related to the same topics but with different generality , adding more specialized tags as the number of collected resources grows .    on a very basic level , we have tested how such hierarchical tagging , affects the topology of the tag co  occurrence network by a simple toy model defined in the following . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that tags are organized on a taxonomy , that is , a tree  like structure stemming from a seed node , where each node corresponds to a tag and is an offspring of another tag belonging to the same branch of knowledge with higher generality . at discrete time steps </S>",
    "<S> , a new post is added to the system , with a new resource and 2 tags . </S>",
    "<S> the first tag can be a new one , with probability @xmath33 : in such case , the new tag is an offspring of a tag randomly chosen among the already employed ones . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the first tag is chosen at random among the already employed ones . </S>",
    "<S> the second tag is either chosen at random from within the whole set of used tags or , with probability @xmath34 , it is chosen according to hierarchy : in such case , the second tag is drawn at random among the nodes that lie on the shortest path length from the first tag to the seed node on the tree  like taxonomy .    </S>",
    "<S> the tag co  occurrence network resulting from the above algorithm share some features of the _ citeulike _ one , if we assume a time  dependent @xmath33 which reproduces the sub - linear vocabulary growth observed in reality , and by a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath34 , which mimics the relevance of hierarchy in tagging activity . to reproduce the growth rule , </S>",
    "<S> we have set @xmath35 and imposed that @xmath36 and @xmath37 where the number of resources @xmath38 , the number of tag assignments @xmath39 , the number of tags @xmath40 and @xmath41 are set to the same values they take in _ </S>",
    "<S> citeulike_. as a result , this yields @xmath42 and @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> .    as shown in figure [ strength - dist ] , the strength distribution @xmath18 of tags is a scale  free one with a good agreement with reality in the decaying exponent for large values of @xmath17 if one sets @xmath44 . for such choice of the parameter , the clustering coefficient reproduces qualitatively the algebraic decay observed in _ </S>",
    "<S> citeulike _ , as shown in figure [ summarymodel ] , although the absolute value differs of orders of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> we have found , thus , a simple model that captures the complex features of a tag co  occurrence network issued from the dataset describing an online collaborative tagging system , _ </S>",
    "<S> citeulike_. in particular , by assuming that users label resources by hierarchically associated tags , the probability distribution of nodes strength is reproduced for a suitable choice of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the model reproduces qualitatively the decaying asymptotic behavior of the clustering coefficient @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> such quantity encodes a signature of the semantical organization of concepts represented by tags , so that malicious or meaningless tag assignments can be detected by inspecting the perturbation to the clustering coefficient they generate . establishing a relationship between clustering and semantics may suggest tools and algorithms for technological tasks such as automatic categorization of resources , recommendation and spam detection techniques .    </S>",
