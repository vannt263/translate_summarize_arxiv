    "the subtlety of the theory of swimming at low reynolds number has not always been fully appreciated .",
    "it is important to have simple examples for which calculations can be performed in detail .",
    "the first such example was furnished by taylor @xcite in his seminal work on the swimming of an undulating planar sheet immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid .",
    "soon after , lighthill @xcite studied the swimming of a sphere .",
    "he considered a squirming sphere with surface displacements in the spherical surface .",
    "his work was extended by blake @xcite , who considered the full class of surface displacements .",
    "the goal of the theory is to calculate the swimming velocity and the rate of dissipation in the fluid for given time - periodic deformations of the body .",
    "the rate of dissipation equals the power necessary to achieve the swimming motion .",
    "shapere and wilczek formulated the problem in terms of a gauge field on the space of shapes @xcite .",
    "they pointed out @xcite that the measure of efficiency of a stroke introduced by lighthill and blake is not appropriate . in low reynolds number swimming , unlike in the problem of stokes friction , the power is proportional to the speed , rather than the square of the speed .",
    "as a measure of efficiency shapere and wilczek therefore introduced a dimensionless number measuring the ratio of speed and power , rather than the ratio of speed squared and power .",
    "the theory of swimming at low reynolds number is based on the stokes equations @xcite . in earlier work",
    "we have extended the theory to include the rate of change of fluid momentum , as given by the linearized navier - stokes equations @xcite . as an example we studied small - amplitude swimming of a deformable sphere @xcite , and found the optimum efficiency for the class of swimming motions for which the first order flow velocity is irrotational .",
    "our definition of efficiency was analogous to that of shapere and wilczek .",
    "the calculation based on the linearized navier - stokes equations was rather elaborate .",
    "it turns out that for irrotational flow the inertial effect vanishes , so that for this class of fluid motions it suffices to use the stokes equations .",
    "this allows a simpler formalism and easier calculations . in the following we discuss the theory on the basis of the stokes equations , and in addition",
    "derive some new results .",
    "the stroke of maximum efficiency involves a significant contribution of high order multipoles .",
    "this leads us to consider an additional measure of swimming performance , allowing minimization of the energy consumption at fixed amplitude of stroke .",
    "we provide a numerical estimate of speed and power for optimal swimming via potential flow of a typical bacterium .",
    "customarily the speed is calculated for given power from stokes drag @xcite .    in the first part of the article we restrict attention to axisymmetric irrotational flow .",
    "the fluid flow velocity can be derived from a scalar potential which satisfies laplace s equations .",
    "it is therefore natural to introduce multipoles in analogy to electrostatics @xcite . to linear order",
    "the pressure disturbance vanishes .",
    "the swimming speed and the power are bilinear in the surface displacements .",
    "the class of potential flows is important because of the connection to inviscid flow theory based on the full set of navier - stokes equations , as relevant for swimming at high reynolds number @xcite .",
    "subsequently we study more general axisymmetric polar flow .",
    "this involves modes with vorticity and a non - vanishing pressure disturbance , and requires the use of an additional set of multipoles .",
    "it turns out that the more complicated flow with vorticity leads to a significantly higher maximum efficiency than found for potential flow .",
    "again we consider the measure of swimming performance based on energy consumption at fixed amplitude , and provide a numerical estimate for a typical bacterium .",
    "we consider a flexible sphere of radius @xmath0 immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid of shear viscosity @xmath1 . at low reynolds number and on a slow time scale the flow velocity @xmath2 and the pressure @xmath3 satisfy the stokes equations @xmath4 the fluid is set in motion by time - dependent distortions of the sphere .",
    "we shall study periodic distortions which lead to swimming motion of the sphere .",
    "the surface displacement @xmath5 is defined as the vector distance @xmath6 of a point @xmath7 on the displaced surface @xmath8 from the point @xmath9 on the sphere with surface @xmath10 .",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath2 is required to satisfy @xmath11 this amounts to a no - slip boundary condition .",
    "the instantaneous translational swimming velocity @xmath12 , the rotational swimming velocity @xmath13 , and the flow pattern @xmath14 follow from the condition that no net force or torque is exerted on the fluid .",
    "we evaluate these quantities by a perturbation expansion in powers of the displacement @xmath15 .    in the first part of the article we restrict attention to motions for which to first order in the displacement the flow is irrotational , so that the flow velocity is the gradient of a scalar potential , @xmath16 we specify the surface displacement by assuming an expression for the first order potential .",
    "we assume the flow to be symmetric about the @xmath17 axis , so that in spherical coordinates @xmath18 , defined with respect to the center of the sphere in the rest system , the potential takes the form @xmath19 .",
    "the potential @xmath19 tends to zero at infinity , and can be expressed as the poisson integral @xmath20 with a source density @xmath21 localized within the sphere of radius @xmath0 .",
    "to first order the pressure remains constant and equal to the ambient pressure @xmath22 .",
    "we regard the source density @xmath21 as given , and define the surface displacement from @xmath23 instead of @xmath15 we regard @xmath24 as the expansion parameter . for given source density @xmath21 one can evaluate the first order potential @xmath19 by use of eq .",
    "hence one finds the first order flow velocity @xmath25 by use of eq . ( 2.4 ) .",
    "since this tends to zero faster than @xmath26 , the force exerted on the fluid and the swimming velocity @xmath27 vanish to first order .",
    "the rotational velocity @xmath28 and the torque vanish automatically by symmetry .",
    "we consider in particular harmonic time variation at frequency @xmath29 , with source density @xmath30 with suitably chosen functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "since the no - slip condition is nonlinear , the solution of the flow problem involves harmonics with all integer multiples of @xmath29 .",
    "we perform a perturbation expansion in powers of the two - component source density @xmath33 . to second order in @xmath34 the flow velocity and the swimming velocity",
    "take the form @xmath35 both @xmath36 and @xmath15 vary harmonically with frequency @xmath29 , and can be expressed as @xmath37 expanding the no - slip condition eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) to second order we find for the flow velocity at the surface @xmath38 hence the swimming velocity can be evaluated as @xcite @xmath39 the time - averaged swimming velocity is given by @xmath40 where the overhead bar indicates a time - average over a period @xmath41 .",
    "the remainder @xmath42 oscillates at frequency @xmath43 .",
    "to second order the rate of dissipation @xmath44 is determined entirely by the first order solution .",
    "it may be expressed as a surface integral @xcite @xmath45 the rate of dissipation is positive and oscillates in time about a mean value .",
    "the mean rate of dissipation equals the power necessary to generate the motion .",
    "in explicit calculations we expand the source density and the first order potential in spherical harmonics .",

    "it is natural to extend the potential and the corresponding velocity field inside the sphere .",
    "the first order potential outside the sphere is expanded as @xmath51 with dimensionless multipole coefficients @xmath52 .",

    "the crucial identities ( 3.11 ) and ( 3.16 ) are proved by use of the generating function of the legendre polynomials , or by use of known identities relating the polynomials .",
    "the question arises how to maximize the mean swimming velocity for given mean rate of dissipation .",
    "this leads to an eigenvalue problem for the set of multipole coefficients @xmath65 , @xmath79 the mathematical discussion is simplified by truncating the matrices at a maximum @xmath80-value , say @xmath81 .",
    "we call the truncated @xmath82-dimensional matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the truncated matrices correspond to swimmers obeying the constraint that all multipole coefficients for @xmath85 vanish .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( 3.12 ) that there is a degeneracy in the problem .",
    "the sum for the mean velocity consists of a sum of two interlaced chains . in the one chain the @xmath86-coefficients for even @xmath80 and the @xmath87-coefficients for odd @xmath80 appear . in the other chain",
    "the @xmath86-coefficients for odd @xmath80 and the @xmath87-coefficients for even @xmath80 appear .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider the first type of chain .",
    "eigenvectors of this form with the coefficients for the second chain put equal to zero can be mapped onto eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue with the two chains interchanged .",
    "we call eigenvectors of the first type even , and eigenvectors of the second type odd .",
    "the degeneracy corresponds to invariance under a shift in time by @xmath88 .",
    "there is also a symmetry under time reversal .",
    "eigenvalues appear in pairs @xmath89 .",
    "the even eigenvector for @xmath90 can be obtained from the even eigenvector for @xmath91 by the replacement of the @xmath87-coefficients by their opposites , leaving the @xmath86-coefficients unchanged .",
    "for the two conjugate eigenvectors the swimming velocity is equal and opposite for the same rate of dissipation .",
    "the first symmetry allows a simplification of the eigenvalue problem by a reduction of the matrix dimension by a factor one half .",
    "there is a duplication in the matrices @xmath69 and @xmath77 which can be removed by use of complex notation .",
    "thus we introduce the complex multipole moment @xmath92 and correspondingly instead of eq .",

    "basing ourselves on the stokes equations , rather than the linearized navier - stokes equations , we have developed a simpler discussion of the swimming of a sphere at low reynolds number with the restriction to potential flow solutions than was presented before @xcite .",

    "correspondingly , the eigenvalue problem which yields the swimming stroke of maximum efficiency , is relatively simple .",
    "subsequently we have extended the derivation to the complete set of axisymmetric polar solutions of the stokes equations .",
    "an additional set of multipole moments corresponding to flows with vorticity needs to be introduced .",

    "the additional flow solutions allow a considerable enhancement of efficiency , defined as the dimensionless ratio of speed and power . as in the case of irrotational flow ,",
    "the maximum efficiency is attained for a stroke characterized by multipoles with a significant weight at high order .",
    "this indicates that the efficiency is not the most suitable measure of swimming performance .",
    "therefore we have considered a measure of performance based on a comparison of energy consumption for strokes with the same amplitude .",
    "the measure allows selection of a stroke with minimum energy consumption in a class of possible strokes .",
    "the optimal stroke selected in this manner involves multipoles of relatively low order and is expected to be of physical interest .",
    "although the spherical geometry provides only a crude approximation to the shape of most microorganisms , it has the advantage that the mechanism of swimming can be analyzed in great detail .",
