    "the boerdijk - coxeter helix ( bc helix , tetrahelix ) @xcite@xcite is an assemblage of regular tetrahedra in a linear , helical fashion ( figure  [ f : philicesa ] ) .",
    "this assemblage may be obtained by appending faces of tetrahedra together so as to maintain a central axis or , alternatively , r.w .",
    "gray @xcite has produced a description of the bc helix by partitioning into 4-tuples the points of @xmath0 given by the sequence @xmath1 @xmath2[parametrictetrahelix ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 designates the tetrahedral edge length .",
    "( the sequence of faces used while appending , or the sign of the second term in , determine the chirality of the helix . ) due to the irrational value of @xmath7 , it may be observed that the bc helix has an aperiodic nature , in that the structure has no non - trivial translational or rotational symmetries .",
    "here , we describe a modified form of the bc helix that has both translational and rotational symmetries along / about its central axis . figures  [ f : philicesb ] and [ f : philicesc ] show two such modified structures .    0.3     0.3     0.3",
    "the assembly our modified bc helices is distinguished from that of the canonical bc helix in that an additional operation is required between appending tetrahedra to the helix .",
    "this operation is depicted in figure  [ f : makeaphilix ] . starting with a tetrahedron @xmath8 , a face @xmath9 is selected onto which an interim tetrahedron , @xmath10 , is appended .",
    "the @xmath11 tetrahedron is obtained by rotating @xmath10 through an angle @xmath12 about an axis @xmath13 normal to @xmath9 , passing through the centroid of @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting structure depends , principally , on two choices in this process .",
    "firstly , as with the bc helix , the sequence of faces , @xmath14 , selected in the construction of the helix will determine its _ underlying chirality_i.e .",
    ", the chirality of the helix formed by the tetrahedral centroids .",
    "faces may be selected so that some sequences produce right - handed helices , while others produce left - handed helices ( and , certainly , some sequences do not produce helices at all ) .",
    "secondly , there is the choice of the magnitude and direction of the rotation . in the present writing",
    ", we will use the convention that a facial normal vector @xmath13 is pointed away from the face @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath13 points away from the interior of @xmath15 . consequently",
    ", positive values of @xmath12 will correspond to right - handed rotations about @xmath13 , while negative values will produce left - handed rotations . ( and , certainly , a canonical bc helix is obtained for @xmath16 . )",
    "a convenient method of assembly for a modified bc helix is by usage of two transformations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a reflection across face @xmath20 on tetrahedron @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a rotation about an axis normal to this face , passing through its center .",
    "0.3     0.3     0.3     a modified bc helix is formed by applying @xmath23 to the vertices @xmath24 , of tetrahedron @xmath15 to produce @xmath10 .",
    "finally , @xmath25 is obtained by applying @xmath26 to the vertices of @xmath10 , that is : @xmath27 by applying these transformations in an alternating fashion , first to each @xmath15 and then to @xmath10 , a modified bc helix is assembled .",
    "when referring to a modified bc helix , we use the term _ period _ to refer to the number of appended tetrahedra necessary to return to an initial angular position on the helix , and will say that the structure is _ periodic _ when such an integer exists . for almost all values of @xmath12 ,",
    "the associated modified bc helix is aperiodic , however , the resulting structure is periodic for certain values of @xmath12 .",
    "here , we use the term _ m - bc  helix _ to designate a modified bc helix with a period of @xmath28 tetrahedra .    using analytical and numerical methods ,",
    "our group has found modified bc helices with periods of @xmath29 tetrahedra , with the exception of a 6-bc helix . in an upcoming paper",
    ", we demonstrate the impossibility of a modified bc helix with a period of 6 tetrahedra .",
    "table  [ t : periods ] provides a summary of these bc helix periodicities and their corresponding values of @xmath12 , assuming an assembly face sequence @xmath30 that produces a right - handed helix .",
    "( for a sequence that produces a left - handed helix , one only needs to change the sign of the angular values in table  [ t : periods ] . )    ._m_-bc helix periods and their corresponding values of @xmath12 , assuming tetrahedra are appended in a sequence @xmath30 which produces a right - handed helix . for values of @xmath12 corresponding to a left - handed underlying helix , the sign of @xmath12 must be changed . in this table",
    ", @xmath31 designates the golden ratio .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in @xcite , we present novel modifications of icosahedral and pentagonal bipyramid aggregates of tetrahedra involving a rotation through an angular value of @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the golden ratio .",
    "as indicated in table  [ t : periods ] , this value of @xmath12 corresponds to 3 and 5-bc helices . for this reason , as well as the appearance of this angle in fuller s `` jitterbug transformation '' @xcite",
    ", we will focus on the 3 and 5-bc helix in the present writing . in section  [ s : fperiod ]",
    ", we will provide an explicit construction of a 5-bc helix , along with some additional properties of this structure . in section  [ ss:3period ] , the same is done for the 3-bc helix .",
    "in this section we will describe the assembly of the 3 and 5-bc helices .",
    "the approach used here generates a primitive set of tetrahedra following the method of assembly described in section  [ s : genphilix ] while using the value of @xmath12 in .",
    "modified bc helices of arbitrary length may then be generated by translating copies of this primitive set along the helix s central axis ( explicitly provided below ) . due to the presence of the golden ratio in",
    ", we refer to such a structure by the name `` _ _ phi__lix '' .    in order to keep the expressions simple , we choose the starting tetrahedron in a convenient way .",
    "the expressions for any desired philix axis can be obtained by multiplying the values given here by the corresponding rotation matrix . at the conclusion of each of the sections below",
    ", the appropriate transformation is offered to align the philix axis with the _",
    "z_-axis of @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the sign of @xmath12 will determine whether a 3 or a 5-period philix is generated according to the following rule :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( _ i _ ) _ when the chiralities of the rotation by _",
