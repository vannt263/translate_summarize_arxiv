    "recently , the quantum dynamics of microscopic systems have been observed due to the development of experimental methods .",
    "for example , the quantum mechanical magnetization processes of single molecular magnets ( smm ) have attracted much interest .",
    "various new aspects of quantum effects are seen in such systems@xcite .    to investigate the energy level structures of smm molecules , electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments",
    "have been conducted for @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the quantum tunneling effect was monitored by a proton nmr in @xmath1@xcite and the dynamics of each magnetic atom was studied using nmr on mn atoms in @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the esr signal was also studied in @xmath2@xcite .",
    "complex susceptibility has been studied for a long time , and the effects of the exchange and/or dipolar interactions between the numerous constituent spins have been clarified @xcite . in order to evaluate the esr spectra for spatially - structured systems , theoretical approaches for obtaining line shapes from a microscopic view point have recently been proposed by focusing on the effects of the interactions between spins , using direct numerical evaluations of the kubo formula @xcite , along with a field theoretical approach@xcite . in these previous works ,",
    "the line width comes from the interactions between the spins , which are described by the hamiltonian system , and the line shape is given by an ensemble of delta - functions .",
    "the effects of contact with the thermal bath have not been studied , even though the thermal effect has attracted interest in studies of microscopic processes .",
    "thus , an approach becomes necessary to introduce the effects of the surroundings , which cause the temperature dependent width of each resonant peak in the complex susceptibility .    in order to take these effects into account",
    ", we have to study an extended system in contact with a thermal bath , and consider the dynamical effects from the thermal bath . for this purpose ,",
    "the time - evolution of the reduced density operator is usually studied , which is obtained by projecting - out the degrees of freedom of the thermal bath .",
    "a standard formalism has been established for the equation of motion for the reduced density operator@xcite , which is generally called the quantum master equation .",
    "this formalism has been successfully applied to various fields .",
    "for example , the natural line width of a two - level ( spin ) system has been estimated@xcite , and systems with interacting spins@xcite and nonlinear spin relaxation@xcite have been studied .",
    "a rapid thermal bath correlation was assumed in these studies , and analyses were therefore made in the markovian limit .",
    "however , the effect of the finite correlation time of the thermal bath becomes important when we are interested in phenomena where the time scale of the system is comparable to that of the thermal bath .",
    "then , we have to take into account the time - correlation function of the thermal bath and the initial condition of the density operator in the above mentioned master equation . in the equilibrium state of the total system , which consists of the system , the bath , and the interaction between them ,",
    "the density operator is not given by a decoupled form .",
    "therefore , we need to take the contribution from it into account , even though this effect has often been ignored by assuming a factorized form of the density operator . in the regression theorem@xcite , we obtain the time evolution for the average of a quantity for the factorized initial condition and estimate the correlation function from it , which is good in the markovian limit@xcite .",
    "however , for short time phenomena , we need to estimate the correlation function of the quantity in a non - markovian evolution , treating the initial correlation correctly@xcite .",
    "for example , tanimura@xcite obtained an exact hierarchical formulation with a functional integral for the spectral distribution of an ohmic form with a lorentzian cutoff .",
    "breuer and petruccione@xcite studied the effects of the initial correlation on the dynamics of a spin - boson system , and pointed out the importance of their contribution .",
    "however , they did not obtain an explicit form for the correlation function or the complex susceptibility as a function of the frequency .    in the present paper",
    ", we provide a formulation for the complex susceptibility by extending the nakajima - zwanzig type of master equation without discarding the non - markovian effect and the initial correlation .",
    "we derive an equation for the motion of the response function .",
    "then we consider the equation of motion of the quantity @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the initial density operator for the total system and @xmath5 is a system operator .",
    "we include the initial correlation between the relevant system and the bath , which is called the  inhomogeneous term \" of the master equation .",
    "since the equation is described by a time - convolution(tc ) type of equation for the non - markovian dynamics , the laplace transformation can be explicitly evaluated . here",
    "we obtain a concrete form of the complex susceptibility .",
    "it should be noted that the obtained formula is easily evaluated , even in interacting spins , by a concrete numerical calculation .",
    "moreover , by using the hilbert - schmidt ( h - s ) representation , the formula is compactly expressed . in the present formulation , we can include the frequency shift due to a system - bath interaction , which comes from the imaginary part of the memory term expressed by the principal value integral of the correlation function of the thermal bath operators .",
    "while we present the formula up to the second order of cumulants , it could easily be extended to the higher orders .",
    "we apply the obtained formula to spin systems linearly interacting with a bosonic bath . for a single spin system , we study the dependence of the line shape on the type of system - bath coupling , e.g. , the case of pure dephasing , in which only the diagonal component of the spin interacted with the bath , and the case of longitudinal relaxation , in which the off - diagonal components interacted with the bath ( the non - adiabatic interaction ) .",
    "we find that the initial correlation and the frequency shift due to the memory kernel are more dominant in the pure dephasing case than in the non - adiabatic interaction case .",
    "owing to the usage of the h - s representation , we could extend our formalism to multiple - spin systems in a straightforward way .",
    "for a linearly coupled spin chain , the dependence of the peak shift on the angle between the chain and the static field has been studied as the nagata - tazuke effect@xcite . as an example of an application to multispin systems , we study the dependence , including the effects of the thermal environment .",
    "we also study the relationship between the line shape and the geometrical configuration in a three - spin system on a triangle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we provide a general formulation of susceptibility in sec .",
    "the application of the obtained formula to the linear spin - boson model is given in sec .",
    "3 . discussions and concluding remarks are given in sec . 4",
    "in this section , we present a formulation of the complex susceptibility of a system in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "generally , the linear response theory gives the complex susceptibility in the form@xcite @xmath6 \\rho_{eq } , \\label{eqn:1}\\ ] ] which describes the response of the operator @xmath7 to an oscillating external field conjugate to the operator @xmath8 with the frequency @xmath9 .",
    "here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are components of the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and @xmath14 denotes an equilibrium state .",
    "if we consider the response in a pure quantum state , the time evolution of @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 and @xmath14 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath19 is the partition function of the system at a temperature @xmath20 @xmath21 . on the other hand , to analyze the complex susceptibility under dissipation , we need to describe the time evolution of @xmath15 by taking into account the interaction between the relevant system and a thermal bath .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the dynamics in contact with a thermal bath are not only given by the quantum dynamics of the system , but are also affected by memory effects inherent in the contact with the thermal bath .",
    "the memory effect is often treated in the so - called markovian approximation@xcite .",
    "this approximation is often used to study the time evolution of the reduced density operator of a system , which leads to the quantum master equation .",
    "as long as the equation has the so - called lindblad - kossakowski - sudarshan form@xcite as in the field of quantum optics , the density operator is positive definite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the markovian approximation may violate the positivity of the density operator . in particular , in a spin - boson model , the breakdown of the positivity has been explicitly reported .",
    "a method to amend this breakdown has been proposed using a kind of slippage supplement in the initial conditions@xcite .",
    "using the markovian time evolution with this supplement enables us to simulate the time evolution of non - markovian time evolution , but its validity is limited in a time region larger than the correlation time of the thermal bath@xcite .    since experimental development",
    "has accelerated in recent years , we need to formulate a line shape theory that can correctly describe the non - markovian effect , including the region of the correlation time of the thermal bath . moreover , the term for the system - bath correlation at an initial time in the equation for the time evolution of the density operator has often been ignored .",
    "however , the importance of this term has been pointed for obtaining a correct description of the dynamics@xcite .",
    "finally , we also need a compact formula that can be evaluated by a concrete numerical method . for this purpose",
    ", we will present a straightforward way to derive a complex susceptibility that includes the initial correlation as well as the non - markovian effect .",
