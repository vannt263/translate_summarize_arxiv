    "it is interesting to study whether some of these predictions can be extended to finite size multilayer graphene stacks ( such as ribbons and flakes ) .",
    "moreover , due to recent advances in fabrication of less than 10 nm wide nanoribbons with the control of their edge morphology @xcite and observing magnetic edge states in few - layer graphene ribbons @xcite , our studies of interplay of magnetism and electric field effects in multilayer nanoribbons have important implications in interpreting experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the electronic structure of multilayer graphene nanoribbons using _ first principles _ electronic structure method @xcite and address the interplay of magnetism , perpendicular external electric field and the energy gap .",
    "our study suggests the existence of three classes of energy gaps in multilayer armchair nanoribbons , and strong dependence of magnetic properties on the edge alignments and the number of layers in multilayer zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "we discuss the effect of a perpendicular external electric field on multilayer nanoribbons and find that gaps can be enhanced in metallic abc - stacked nanoribbons whereas in other nanoribbons , gaps decrease with increasing electric field or remain almost zero .",
    "we begin by describing the computational method and the parameters used for this study in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we present the electronic structure of multilayer armchair nanoribbons and discuss the width dependence of energy gaps . band structure of multilayer zigzag nanoribbons and the interplay of band structure , edge magnetism and resulting gaps will be discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v , we discuss the external electric field effects on the energy gaps of ab- and abc - periodic ribbons . in the following discussions , the direction of the applied external electric field",
    "is taken to be perpendicular to the ribbon layers .",
    "finally we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "-alignment and @xmath1-alignment in multilayer graphene nanoribbons .",
    "the two edge alignments are distinguished by different ways of shifting the top layer with respect to the other in finite size multilayer graphene stacks .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of edges along which nanoribbons span infinitely . ]",
    "we use a plane - wave basis - based electronic structure method @xcite with ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite for core - valence interaction to obtain multilayer band structures . in our previous studies of bilayer nanoribbons @xcite and flakes",
    "@xcite , it was found that the interlayer distance and the appearance of edge magnetism is sensitive to the particular local or semi - local approximation used . for the sake of consistency and meaningful comparisons , the same generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite",
    "was used to capture the edge magnetism with the fixed interlayer distance of 0.335 nm .",
    "we note that van der waal s interaction , which anchors the layers of graphene together , is not addressed within kohn - sham dft and recently there have been several attempts to include these interactions seamlessly in the density functionals @xcite , which could capture the interlayer distance between graphene layers accurate to within 5@xmath2 .",
    "it was shown @xcite , however , that although van der waals interaction contribute to interlayer distance dependent total energy , it has weak influence on overall band structure at a given distance , thus we neglect the van der waals interaction in this study .",
    "the unsaturated carbon @xmath3-orbitals were passivated with hydrogen atoms and the c - h distance was fixed at 0.1084 nm . therefore ,",
    "our results are appropriate in situations where ribbons are cut in a hydrogen environment .    in graphene sheets , there are three distinct stacking arrangements , labeled by a , b and c , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) . for nanoribbons , we consider two types of edges ( armchair and zigzag ) , each with two edge alignments namely @xmath0- and @xmath1-alignments , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) . for more than two graphene layers ,",
    "the stacking combinations multiply and each stacking sequence presents a particular band structure @xcite .",
    "density functional theory predicts that periodic ab stacking ( bernal ) and periodic abc stacking ( rhombohedral ) are almost energetically degenerate in bulk graphite @xcite .",
    "recently , abc stacking was realized on a sic(0001 ) substrate @xcite experimentally , and electric field - induced gap opening was predicted theoretically in abc - stacked trilayer graphene as well as abca - stacked tetralayer graphene @xcite .",
    "thus , for multilayer ribbons with more than 3 layers , we only focus on periodic ab and abc stacking sequences .    , metallic nanoribbon , ( b ) aba-@xmath0 , semiconducting nanoribbon ( c ) abc-@xmath0 , metallic nanoribbon , and ( d ) abc-@xmath0 , semiconducting nanoribbon",
    ". the chosen widths for metallic and semiconducting ribbons are 0.86 nm and 1.11 nm which corresponds to @xmath4=8 and @xmath4=10 respectively , where @xmath4 is the number of carbon chains along the width direction . ]    , ( b ) aba-@xmath1 , ( c ) abc-@xmath0 , and ( d ) abc-@xmath1-aligned nanoribbons .",
    "three classes of the nanoribbons are clearly seen in ( a)-(d ) and specified by @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 where _ n _ is the number of carbon chains along the width direction . here _",
    "= 1,2,@xmath8,13 , which translate to nanoribbons with widths up to 5 nm . ]    to establish the ground state magnetic order for the zigzag ribbons , we tested both narrow and wide ribbons with non - magnetic , ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order between the layers , while we set ferromagnetic coupling along each edge and antiferromagnetic coupling between the two edges within the same layer , as predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "we find that interlayer antiferromagnetic order has lower energy than ferromagnetic , non - magnetic , or non - collinear magnetic order in the ribbons .",
    "we also find that the same ground state is reached with other forms of semi - local exchange - correlation potentials such as pbe @xcite , pbesol @xcite , rpbe @xcite .",
    "therefore , for calculating band structures and other related quantities in this article , we consider interlayer antiferromagnetic order as a magnetic ground state of multilayer graphene ribbons .    the nanoribbons were placed in a supercell with vacuum regions next to the width and the stacking direction . for trilayer ribbons , we used a 1.5 nm vacuum region and for tetralayer , pentalayer and hexalayer ribbons , 2 nm , 2.5 nm and 3 nm vacuum regions were used , respectively .",
    "the necessity for taking different vacuum sizes for increasing number of layers was guided by the need to avoid intercell interaction in dft in order to treat the multilayer stack as an isolated system and also the saw - tooth type implementation of electric potential in the dft code we used .",
    "the bulk trilayer graphene calculations @xcite suggested an external electric field , applied perpendicular to the ribbon layers , as high as 4 v / nm is necessary in order to achieve saturation of the gap .",
    "therefore , we use a maximum external electric field strength of 5 v / nm to study its effect on the multilayer ribbon gaps .",
    "we used 68 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and kinetic energy cut - off of 475 ev .",
    "the convergence of the calculations was tested with respect to a denser * k*-point mesh , larger energy cut - offs as well as larger vacuum sizes .",
    "in this section , we discuss the electronic structure of multilayer armchair ribbons and the width dependence of energy gaps .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows energy band structures of armchair ribbons stacked in aba and abc fashion .",
    "the fermi energy is placed at zero . like in monolayer and bilayer armchair nanoribbons , both metallic and semiconducting trilayer ribbons are possible .",
    "note that for the metallic aba nanoribbon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ) we find one linear and one quadratic band , while for metallic abc nanoribbon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) ) there is one cubic band near the fermi energy .",
    "the appearance of the low energy states and corresponding energy dispersions are consistent with the energy spectrum analysis in bulk multilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the width dependence of the ribbon gaps .",
    "we consider the ribbons with maximum widths up to 5 nm . figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the width dependent gap variation of trilayer armchair ribbons for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-alignments in aba and abc stackings .",
    "similarly as monolayer@xcite and bilayer ribbons@xcite , three classes of ribbons are clearly seen in all cases , two semiconducting ( @xmath9 ) and one metallic ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath4 denotes the number of carbon chains along the width direction and @xmath11 is an integer number .",
    "( here , because of relatively smaller gap size , we call @xmath10 ribbons as _ metallic _ though for small @xmath11 , the ribbons are actually semi - conducting . )",
    "note that compared to bilayer armchair nanoribbons , these gaps are consistently smaller @xcite . as the number of layers increases , more energy bands appear near the fermi level due to the coupling between the layers at the dft level , which reduces the gap size .      for tetralayer graphene",
    ", we consider periodic ab and abc stacking sequences with widths up to 5 nm . as with mono- , bi- and tri - layer graphene ribbons , there exists three classes of ribbons in both stacking sequences , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the origin of this decrease in gaps may again be attributed to appearance of more energy states , near the fermi level , as discussed in the previous section .",

    "in this section , we study zigzag edged multilayer ribbons and the induction of an energy gap due to edge magnetism .",
    "we first describe the interesting electronic structure and edge magnetism in trilayer zigzag nanoribbons , and then extend our discussions to multilayer ribbons .",
    "zigzag ribbons , due to their edge states , show magnetic order and their ground states are predicted to have the interlayer antiferromagnetic order , as discussed in sec .",

    "edge magnetic order induces an energy gap by breaking the flat band degeneracy ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fig5](c ) ) , several flat bands appear together at the fermi level and as a result , the system is again unstable and becomes magnetic due to the presence of comparatively large density of states .",

    "[ fig : fig5](d ) ) .",
    "the flat bands and magnetically induced energy gap are also seen in bilayer graphene nanoribbons ( see fig . 5 and 6 in ref . 18 ) .",
    "the number of flat bands at the fermi level or away from it depends on the number of graphene layers .     and @xmath1 alignments . panels ( a ) and ( b ) are , respectively , for non - magnetic and magnetic @xmath0-aligned ribbons , and panels ( c ) and ( d ) are for @xmath1-aligned ribbons",

    "the gap is 0.433 ev ( 0.118 ev ) for the zigzag ( armchair ) ribbon .",
    "the increase of the gap with increasing width after 3 nm in abc - stacked ribbons is somewhat surprising .",
    "we increased the vacuum region from 1.5 nm to 3 nm and 5 nm , and repeated the calculations for these widths but again find the same increasing trend .",
