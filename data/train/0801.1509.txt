    "transiting extrasolar planets offer our best opportunity for measuring fundamental parameters of extrasolar planets , such as radius and mass , allowing us to test our models for planetary formation and evolution . to - date",
    "the only transiting planets known in the southern sky are those discovered by surveys targeting the galactic plane ( e.g. @xcite ) and find planets around stars with typical visual magnitudes of 1617 .",
    "the superwasp - south ( wasp - s ) instrument looks for transiting planets around stars of visual magnitude 813 , and will eventually cover the entire southern sky , excluding the galactic plane .",
    "we report here the discovery of wasp-4b , a transiting hot - jupiter orbiting a star of magnitude 12.5 .",
    "this is the first discovery by wasp - s , made in collaboration with radial - velocity measurements from the coralie spectrograph on the 1.2-m euler telescope .",
    "the discovery marks the beginning of a campaign to discover brighter transiting extrasolar planets in the southern hemisphere , to complement those discovered in the north by projects including hat @xcite , tres @xcite , xo @xcite and wasp @xcite .",
    "transit searches are most sensitive to large planets with short orbital periods , and have now found nine jupiter - mass planets in orbits of less than 2 d. this has led to suggestions of a class of very - hot jupiters @xcite , with highly irradiated atmospheres ( e.g. @xcite ) , to which wasp-4b likely belongs .",
    "the wasp ( wide angle search for planets ) consortium operates two identical robotic observatories ; superwasp - north on la palma , in the northern hemisphere , and superwasp - south , in the southern hemisphere , hosted by the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "each consists of eight wide - field cameras consisting of an 11.1-cm aperture canon 200 mm f/1.8 lens backed by a 2k@xmath42k e2v ccd .",
    "the eight cameras cover 490 square degrees per pointing .",
    "wasp - s started operating in may 2006 , with a strategy of tiling six to eight fields with a cadence of 510 mins and exposure times of 30 secs .",
    "these fields rotate with the seasons , accumulating to a strip centered on a declination of 32@xmath5 , resulting in lightcurves for over one million stars brighter than 13@xmath0 magnitude . for details of the wasp project , hardware and data processing see @xcite .",
    "further details of our data analysis procedures are given in @xcite , reporting the discovery of wasp-1b and wasp-2b from superwasp - north , and in @xcite reporting the discovery of wasp-3b .        from the wasp - s data collected between 2006 may ",
    "november we identified 1swaspj233415.06420341.1 ( usno - b1.0",
    "0479 - 0948995 ) as a high - priority planetary transit candidate ; over 4000 measurements revealed a possible transit recurring every 1.3 days ( see @xcite for a description of our transit - search methods and @xcite for an account of our selection of high - priority candidates ) .",
    "a catalogue search within the 48 \" photometric aperture of 1swaspj233415.06420341.1 revealed no bright blending companions or known variable / active stars , which could mimic the photometric signature of a transiting planet .",
    "the wasp - s discovery lightcurve is shown in figure  [ figure : sw ] .",
    "a full transit of wasp-4b was observed by eulercam on the 1.2-m euler telescope on 2007 september 25@xmath0 .",
    "observations were performed in r - band and were heavily de - focussed to allow exposure times of @xmath62 mins , achieving an rms scatter of 1.8 mmags despite poor transparency conditions .",
    "part of a transit was also observed in sdss i band by the 2.0-m faulkes telescope south ( fts ) on 2007",
    "september 27@xmath0 . the wasp - s , eulercam and fts lightcurves",
    "are shown in figure  [ figure : phot ] .",
    "spectroscopic measurements were obtained using the coralie spectrograph installed on the euler telescope .",
    "coralie was originally a twin copy of the elodie spectrograph @xcite .",
    "however , triggered by the interest to carry out spectroscopic follow - up on transit candidates with this instrument , in june 2007 we carried out major changes to coralie to increase its performance on fainter stars . the fibre link and the cross - disperser optics",
    "have been removed and replaced by a new design ( queloz et al . in prep . ) . the double scrambler has also been removed and the grism and prism cross - disperser component replaced by a series of 4 schott f2 prisms of 32@xmath5 angle each .",
    "the net outcome of this new design is to maintain the spectral range from 381 to 681 nm but with a large efficiency gain of about a factor of 6 ( 8 below 420 nm ) and a spectroscopic resolution of 5500060000 ( increased by 1020% ) .",
    "the overall instrumental precision is also improved .",
    "all exposures are reduced by the automated pipeline adapted to the new optical configuration .",
    "wasp-4 was observed from 2007 september to november and the radial velocity and the @xmath7 computed using a g2-spectral template .",
    "exposures were 30 minutes in length , achieving a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath615 .",

    "blended eclipsing binaries can be identified from multi - colour photometry or through lightcurve modeling @xcite , however , the simplest and most reliable method is to search for variations in the spectral line profiles themselves .",
    "this has the added advantage of highlighting atmospheric distortion effects which can also affect the measured radial velocities .",

    "in addition to the spectral analysis , we have also used tycho b , v and 2mass magnitudes to estimate the effective temperature using the infrared flux method @xcite .",

    "these results imply a spectral type of around g7 .",

    "the stars wasp-4 and tres-3 are thought to be older , however the synchronisation time for wasp-4 would be longer still at 8 gyr ( using the method of @xcite ) , so their low rotational velocity is consistent with their not having been spun - up by their planets .    a preliminary estimate of the stellar parameters indicates that the parent star is spectral type g7v with solar metallicity .",
    "together with the short orbital period of 1.34 d this results in a blackbody planetary surface temperature , assuming zero albedo and isotropic re - radiation , of 1760 k. the orbital distance of 0.023 au places wasp-4b well within the criterion ( @xmath72 au ) for the proposed new class of pm planets @xcite .",
