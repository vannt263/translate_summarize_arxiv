    "in high-@xmath3 cuprates , [ 001]-tilt grain boundaries ( gbs ) in mgo and srtio@xmath1 bicrystal substrates have been commonly used for realizing josephson junctions as well as investigating transport properties of gbs . after the discovery of fe - based pnictide superconductors,@xcite the community became immediately interested in exploring grain boundaries in this new class of superconductors .    despite the recent success of realizing co - doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( ba-122 ) on [ 001]-tilt",
    "gb mgo and srtio@xmath1 bicrystal substrates,@xcite these substrates may not be suitable for several reasons .",
    "firstly , a large misfit between ba-122 and mgo of around 6% leads to low crystalline quality or even non - epitaxial growth under our deposition condition.@xcite secondly , the srtio@xmath1 substrate becomes electrically conductive under ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions , which may compromise transport measurements particularly near the normal - superconducting transition .",
    "however , implementation of fe for mgo and fe+mgal@xmath0o@xmath2 for srtio@xmath1 as buffer layers can solve those problems .",
    "an fe layer itself is electrically conductive , however , the recalculation of the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) and the critical current density ( @xmath4 ) is possible due to its thin layer thickness ( 20nm).@xcite in this report , the fabrication of co - doped ba-122 thin films on both [ 001]-tilt bicrystal mgo and srtio@xmath1 substrates and their transport properties are presented in detail . for the aim of bicrystal josephson junctions , substrates with a large [ 001]-tilt angle of over 20@xmath5 have been used in this investigation .",
    "a 20 nm thick fe buffer layer was deposited by means of pulse laser deposition ( pld ) on a [ 001]-tilt mgo bicrystal substrate with misorientation angle of @xmath6=36.8@xmath5 ( nominal value ) at room temperature , followed by a high - temperature annealing at 700@xmath5c .",
    "this process is very effective for obtaining epitaxial fe layers with flat surface .",
    "after the fe buffer preparation , co - doped ba-122 ( bafe@xmath7co@xmath8as@xmath0 ) with 100 nm thickness was deposited at 700@xmath5c .",
    "all deposition processes have been conducted under uhv condition .",
    "a detailed description of both fe buffer and co - doped ba-122 deposition procedure can be found in ref.@xcite . after the structural characterization described in _ sub - section 2.3 _ ,",
    "au layers were deposited on the films by pld at room temperature followed by ion beam etching to fabricate bridges of 0.5 mm width and 1 mm length for transport measurements .",
    "a mgal@xmath0o@xmath2 buffer was deposited on a [ 001]-tilt gb srtio@xmath1 bicrystal substrate with @xmath6=30@xmath5 at 650@xmath5c by pld in uhv condition ( pulse number 4000 at 40mj ) . in a pilot experiment , we have confirmed that mgal@xmath0o@xmath2 can be grown epitaxially on srtio@xmath1 ( 100 ) substrate .",
    "after the primary buffer deposition , the mgal@xmath0o@xmath2-buffered srtio@xmath1 substrate was cooled to room temperature for the secondary , fe buffer deposition .",
    "a 20 nm thick fe buffer was prepared by the same procedure as described in _ sub - section 2.1 _ except for the annealing temperature . here , a slightly higher temperature of 750@xmath5c was employed .",
    "after the fe buffer preparation , a 100 nm thick co - doped ba-122 ( bafe@xmath9co@xmath10as@xmath0 ) layer was deposited . _ in - situ _ gold layer deposition at room temperature was conducted after the ba-122 deposition for the aim of protection from possible damage during the structuring process .",

    "xrd patterns in logarithmic scale ( fig.[fig : figure1](a ) ) clearly show that the film has been grown with high phase purity and @xmath13-axis texture , i.e. with [ 001 ] perpendicular to the substrate surface .",

    "it is evident from fig.[fig : figure1](b ) that two grains with @xmath15 , which is slightly larger than the nominal value of 36.8@xmath5 , are grown due to the perfect transfer of the grain orientation from the substrate via fe buffer to the ba-122 layer . here",
