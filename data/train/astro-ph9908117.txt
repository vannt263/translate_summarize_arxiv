    "the measurement of interstellar dust grains by the dust detectors on - board the ulysses and galileo spacecraft , allows us to determine the grain mass distribution of the local interstellar dust component .",
    "impacts by interstellar dust grains were clearly identified first in the ulysses data after ulysses fly - by of jupiter in february 1992 @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that they can be distinguished from interplanetary grains by their retrograde impact direction which also coincides with the direction from which interstellar neutral helium atoms enter the solar system @xcite . a further indication that ulysses did detect interstellar grains was the nearly constant rate and direction of impacts on the ulysses detector after the spacecraft left the ecliptic plane and performed measurements at high latitudes @xcite .",
    "additionally , the measured impact velocities measured by ulysses after jupiter fly - by indicated , although subject to substantial uncertainties , that the dust velocities exceeded the local escape velocity , even if radiation pressure effects were neglected .",
    "the detection of interstellar dust grains by ulysses were confirmed by measurements with the galileo dust detector @xcite .",
    "the mass distribution of dust grains in the galactic interstellar medium is an indicator for the grain growth and destruction processes inside the medium .",
    "it was recognized very early @xcite , that in cold environments the accretion of gas onto solid particles and their agglomeration increases the number of large particles and decreases the number of small ones .",
    "grain destruction in hot environments has the opposite effect , since large particles are shattered into smaller ones and mass is removed from grains and returned to the gas phase by sputtering",
    ". the effect of a variable mass distribution can be observed by analyzing the wavelength dependence of the extinction of starlight along different lines of sight through the interstellar medium ( for a review see mathis , [ 1990 ] ) . since the shape of the extinction curve is sensitive to the mass distribution of dust grains that cause the extinction , the mass distribution can be determined , in part , by fitting the wavelength dependence of extinction @xcite .",
    "these models of the mass distribution and composition of interstellar dust are constrained by the total amount of refractory elements available in the medium to form dust grains , that is , the mass in refractory elements locked up in the dust plus the mass in refractory elements in the gas phase should not exceed the cosmic abundances of the elements .",
    "consequently , models of interstellar dust based on fits to the extinction curve do not contain large amounts of big grains , because the large mass of refractory elements contributed by the large dust grains would contradict cosmic abundance considerations @xcite .",
    "for example , the mass distribution of the mathis et al . [ 1977 ] model is cut off at grain radii of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 assuming a grain mass density of @xmath5 ) . in contradiction to this suggested cut - off , most of the grains detected by ulysses and galileo have higher masses . assuming that the mass contained in the interstellar dust grains measured with ulysses and galileo in the solar system represents the value of the dust mass density in the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) , and comparing it with the mass contained in the gas phase of the lic , it was found @xcite that the mass of refractory elements found in the lic exceeds cosmic abundance limits .    for each impact onto the dust detectors , the ulysses and galileo dust instruments measure the velocity , mass , and direction of an impacting grain @xcite .",
    "since the detectors are mounted at angles of @xmath6 ( ulysses ) and @xmath7 ( galileo ) with respect to the spin - axes of the spacecraft , the impact direction is given by the detector pointing ( rotation angle ) at the time of impact with an accuracy of @xmath8 ( field of view ) .",
    "the signal rise time is a measure for the impact velocity and the mass of the impacting grain is then derived from the impact velocity and the signal amplitude . by calibrating the instruments on the ground",
    "@xcite it was found that the derived mass depends strongly on the impact velocity ( see below ) .",
    "earlier determinations of the mass distribution of interstellar dust grains detected by ulysses and galileo @xcite used the masses derived from the measured impact velocity , which can only be determined with an uncertainty of a factor of @xmath9 , resulting in an uncertainty of the derived mass of a factor of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the mass of the dust grains can be determined with a higher accuracy if the impact velocity was determined from theoretical considerations .    in this work ,",
    "we determine the mass distribution of interstellar dust grains detected by ulysses and galileo by using impact velocities calculated from simple dynamical models .",
    "the resulting mass distribution should be more reliable , provided that the    approximated impact velocities deviate by less than a factor of @xmath9 from the true values . to visualize the contribution of different grain sizes to the number , cross section and total mass of dust grains in the lic",
    ", we use `` moments '' of the differential mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath11-th moment of the differential logarithmic distribution @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 . in section [ sec_vimodel ]",
    "we describe the procedure of the mass determination and the models used to calculate the impact velocity , section [ sec_massdis ] describes the resulting mass distributions and their moments . in section [ sec_radar ]",
    "we compare the ulysses and galileo measurements with the measurements of recently discovered @xcite interstellar radar meteors .",
    "for our analysis we use galileo dust data collected between september 1993 ( after fly - by of asteroid ida ) and july 1995 ( prior to probe release operations ) .",
    "the ulysses dataset we use contains impacts measured between february 1992 ( after jupiter fly - by ) and february 1999 ( latest data ) . since the dust datasets collected by ulysses and galileo contain impacts by interplanetary as well as interstellar grains , we have to find selection criteria that allow us to define datasets , that contain a negligible amount of other than interstellar impacts .",
    "both , ulysses and galileo have detected dust particles that had been ejected from the jovian system in streams @xcite .",
    "these streams can easily be identified in the datasets , because they occur within a short period of time .",
    "impacts of stream particles have been removed from both datasets by rejecting impacts that occur in a time interval that is associated with a stream event .",
    "interstellar particles approach ulysses and galileo from a direction that is opposite to the direction expected for classic interplanetary grains , that is grains on prograde , circular orbits .",
    "therefore , we preliminarily define interstellar datasets by selecting every impact that was measured at a rotation angle of the sensor for which the interstellar upstream direction was within the field of view of the detector . we allow for a @xmath14 margin , because interstellar grains do not move on perfectly straight lines . since the sensor has a field of view of @xmath8 , we expect no particles on prograde circular orbits to be present in the so defined datasets .",
    "we now remove impacts from the preliminary datasets for which an other than interstellar origin has been suggested . for galileo , no interplanetary source has been suggested for impacts from the retrograde direction measured outside the asteroid belt .",
    "we therefore use the dataset of @xmath15 impacts shown in figure  [ fig_galdata ] for our further analysis .",
    "when ulysses crossed the ecliptic at a heliocentric distance of @xmath16 in march 1995 , the directions of interstellar and prograde interplanetary grains were not as clearly separated as it was the case during the rest of ulysses orbit .",
    "we therefore exclude all measurements when ulysses was between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ecliptic latitude around perihelion . over the sun s poles , ulysses detected very small particles that have been interpreted @xcite as fragments of interplanetary particles ejected from the inner solar system by electromagnetic effects . to remove these particles from the ulysses dataset",
    ", we require that the measured amplitude of the ion charge signal , which increases with impact velocity and the mass of the impactor , is more than one order of magnitude above the detection threshold .",
    "the described criteria are identical to the criteria used by landgraf [ 1998 ] , but here they are applied to a more recent dataset . after removing possible interplanetary impacts from the dataset",
    "as described above , we use the dataset of @xmath19 impacts shown in figure  [ fig_ulsdata ] for our analysis .    by changing the numerical values of the parameters we use to select the datasets ( directional margin , charge signal amplitude cut - off ) we estimate the relative uncertainty in the number of interstellar particles to be smaller than @xmath20 , on a @xmath21 confidence level .",
    "the change of velocity of an interstellar grain in the solar system can easily be determined by taking into account the acceleration due to solar gravity and radiation pressure . for sub - micron grains the strength of radiation pressure ,",
    "expressed as the ratio of magnitudes of radiation pressure to gravity @xmath22 , can be in the same order ( @xmath23 ) or even larger ( @xmath24 ) as the strength of gravity . in this work we use two simple models to determine the velocity of the grains :    1 .",
    "the radiation pressure force and gravity have exactly the same magnitude and opposite directions ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore , the grains move on straight lines with their initial velocity and direction . in this case",
    "the impact velocity is simply given by the difference of the grain velocity at infinity and the spacecraft velocity .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 of radiation pressure force to gravity is given by the grain size .",
    "the velocity @xmath26 of the dust grain in the inertial ( heliocentric , ecliptic ) frame is changed by the acceleration ( @xmath27 ) or deceleration ( @xmath24 ) along its trajectory according to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath30 the mass of the sun , and @xmath31 the heliocentric distance at which the grain was detected .    for the calculation of the heliocentric grain velocity",
    "as described in the second model , we have to determine the value of @xmath22 for each individual grain .",
    "to determine @xmath22 we use mie - calculations @xcite for compact spherical grains made of astronomical silicates with bulk densities of @xmath32 , which give @xmath22 as a function of grain radius ( see figure  [ fig_bobeta ] ) .",
    "= .9    because the size @xmath33 of a grain is not measured independently by the ulysses and galileo dust detectors , it has to be derived from the measured mass @xmath34 , i.e. the mass derived from the measured impact velocity , by @xmath35{3m_{\\rm meas}/(4\\pi\\rho_{\\rm d})}$ ] . using the grain radius @xmath33 , we can determine @xmath22 which gives us the dust velocity @xmath26 from equation ( [ eqn_vecl ] ) .",
    "once the the dust velocity in the inertial heliocentric frame is established , the impact velocity @xmath36 is calculated as the magnitude of the velocity relative to the spacecraft . the mass is then given by @xmath37 & = & 1.7\\cdot 10^{-5}\\cdot q_i[{\\rm c}]\\cdot \\left(v_i[{\\rm km}\\;{\\rm s}^{-1 } ] \\right)^{-3.5},\\label{eqn_calib}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as described by grn et al .",
    "[ 1995 ] , where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the measured ion charge signal . from this mass",
    "we determine a new grain size which gives a new @xmath22 , and so forth .",
    "this iterative process gives us the value of @xmath22 and the mass of a particle in a self - consistent way .",
    "a disadvantage of this second model is its dependence on not well known properties of presumably complex dust grains .",
    "therefore , we rely on the first ( constant velocity ) model for grains for which @xmath39 is a good approximation",
    ". it was found that the constant - velocity model is a good approximation for the majority of the impacts detected by ulysses and galileo , because the mie - calculations give a mean value of @xmath22 for all particles measured in - situ is @xmath40 , and for @xmath21 of the detections @xmath22 deviates by less than @xmath41 from unity @xcite .",
    "but since we are interested in the large mass end of the distribution , where @xmath39 is not a good approximation , we apply both methods to the datasets collected by ulysses and galileo , and compare the results .    for both models described above",
    ", we assume an initial velocity of @xmath42 and an upstream direction of @xmath43 heliocentric longitude and @xmath44 heliocentric latitude .",
    "this initial velocity vector is : ( a ) compatible with the heliocentric speeds @xcite and direction of motion @xcite of the grains detected by ulysses , ( b ) close to the asymptotic velocity vector of interstellar neutral helium atoms detected by the ulysses / gas experiment @xcite , and ( c ) compatible with the relative velocity of the sun with respect to the lic @xcite .",
    "we neglect the lorentz - force exerted on the grains by interaction with the solar wind magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation as long as the direction of motion is not strongly changed by the lorentz - force , which is true for particles with masses larger than @xmath45 , since their larmor - radii are in the order of @xmath46 @xcite , much larger than the length of their path through the domain of the solar wind .",
    "we determine the grain mass distributions and their moments of the datasets described in section  [ sec_datasets ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     medium is replenished faster than by condensation in stellar outflows only @xcite .",
    "it is argued @xcite that large grains have long lifetimes in the interstellar medium and provide a source for smaller grains which can then be observed in extinction .",
    "since the ulysses and galileo measurements provide limited statistics of the number of large grains , we compare detections of interstellar radar meteors with ulysses and galileo data to determine how and if the mass distribution of interstellar dust grains detected by the spacecraft can be extrapolated to higher masses .    since the measurements by amor @xcite allow the determination of the impact trajectory and velocity of meteoroids in the earth s atmosphere , hyperbolic meteoroids can be identified .",
    "it is then possible to determine the flux of large ( @xmath47 ) interstellar meteors for various source directions .",
    "it was found that the flux exhibits an ecliptic north - south asymmetry .",
    "the flux from the northern ecliptic hemisphere ( including the upstream direction of grains detected by ulysses and galileo ) was reported to be lower than @xmath48 , whereas a flux of @xmath49 was reported from the southern ecliptic hemisphere .",
    "a discrete source direction of large interstellar grains could be identified for which a flux of @xmath50 was determined @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the large - grain - flux derived from the radar measurements with the extrapolation of the ulysses and galileo results is shown in figure  [ fig_radarcomp ] .",
    "we extrapolate the cumulative ulysses and galileo mass distribution by fitting a power - law function to the distribution of masses larger than @xmath51 , where the distribution is not affected by electromagnetic effects .",
    "the exponent of the resulting fit function is @xmath52 . from the extrapolation of the ulysses and",
    "galileo mass distribution , we expect a flux of less than @xmath53 for grains with masses larger than @xmath54 .",
    "this is compatible with the upper limit given for interstellar radar meteors coming from the same direction as the ulysses and galileo particles .",
    "the flux of interstellar radar meteors from the southern ecliptic hemisphere as well as from the discrete source is one or two orders of magnitude larger than the value expected from the extrapolation of the ulysses and galileo measurements .",
    "we have derived a mass distribution of interstellar grains from the in - situ data gathered by the ulysses and galileo dust detectors using the assumption that interstellar grains impact the detectors with velocities that are given by their initial velocity of @xmath55 at large heliocentric distances , the acceleration by solar gravity and radiation pressure , and the motion of the spacecraft . as a result",
    "we find that the number of large particles decreases and the number of intermediate size particles increases when deriving masses from calculated instead of measured impact velocities .",
    "however , we find that the values derived for        in the ulysses data we find an indication that the mass distribution of interstellar grains is time - variable , as predicted by model calculations @xcite .",
    "long - term measurements are needed to assess the significance of this variability .",
    "grn and landgraf [ 1999 ] suggest that the interstellar mass distribution in the lic consists of two parts : grain masses below @xmath56 are distributed approximately like the dust component that causes extinction in the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite . at @xmath57 a transition to a steeper mass distribution is suggested such that the large grain component still contains a significant amount of mass , but the contribution of each mass decade does not increase further for increasing grain mass .",
    "we determine the slope of the logarithmic cumulative in - situ flux - mass distribution to be @xmath58 .",
    "this figure is close to the slope of @xmath59 , for which each mass decade contributes the same amount to the total mass .",
    "unfortunately , the shape of the measured mass distribution below @xmath57 is strongly affected by heliospheric filtration @xcite and can therefore not be compared directly to the expected mass distribution . in summary",
    "we find that the in - situ measurements support the interpretation of an extended mass distribution as described by grn and landgraf [ 1999 ] .",
    "radar data collected by the amor facility in new zealand indicates that there is a large reservoir of mass in big interstellar grains in the solar vicinity . because these large grains couple to the gas phase of the interstellar medium on length scales much larger than the size of the lic @xcite",
    ", these big grains are not believed to be related to the grain population detected by ulysses and galileo , which enters the solar system from the same direction as helium atoms that originate from the gas phase of the lic .",
    "the radar measurements indicate that the majority of radar meteors arrives from the southern ecliptic hemisphere .",
    "if they were accompanied by a large number of smaller grains , ulysses and galileo would have detected them , which is not the case . since collisional evolution of large dust grains into smaller ones",
    "is believed to be an effective process in the diffuse interstellar medium@xcite , one can speculate that the grains detected by amor have been accompanied by smaller grains , but the small grains have been stopped on its way to the solar system by an interstellar cloud .",
