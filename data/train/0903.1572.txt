    "but such directed motion is also observable in the non - living world , for example in agitated granular matter @xcite . from a physicist s point of view , one of the main interests in these self - propelled systems concerns the basic principles by which directed motion is generated from isotropic energy input in the absence of an externally imposed gradient .    in the above mentioned systems the unidirectional movement of the center of mass results",
    "quite generically from a coupling to the internal coordinates under the influence of ( i ) energy input due to chemical or mechanical nonequilibrium noise and ( ii ) an asymmetric environment for the internal coordinates .",
    "a widely used model of a brownian motor implementing these principles is based on an asymmetric ratchet potential , acting on the centre of mass of the particle @xcite .",
    "models of this type date back to pioneering work of smoluchowski , feynman , and huxley ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and have subsequently attracted a lot of research activities .",
    "the basic concept is that of a brownian particle moving in an asymmetric periodic potential . due to the second law of thermodynamics ,",
    "the asymmetric energy landscape and thermal noise alone are not sufficient to generate directed motion .",
    "a common way to model the effect of the required nonequilibrium energy input is to assume that it gives rise to a rapid increase in the system temperature thus effectively resulting in a periodic switching between high and low temperature states . at high temperature",
    "the particle can freely diffuse over the potential barriers , whereas at low temperature it will be trapped in a potential well .",
    "due to the spatial asymmetry a periodic switching between these states will cause a net movement in a direction prescribed by the asymmetry .",
    "such ratchet models might serve as crude simplifications of the movement mechanism of motor proteins , where the asymmetric periodic potential results from the interaction of the motor with the track and atp hydrolysis is the cause of the sudden temperature jumps .",
    "an alternative picture of a brownian motor can be established by modelling the motor - track interaction in terms of an effective friction force @xcite . very recently",
    "an inchworm model of a self - propelled particle has been proposed in @xcite , where the required spatial asymmetry is implemented by such a friction force .",
    "this model consists of two beads connected by an elastic spring , which are driven by thermal and nonequilibrium noise .",
    "each bead experiences a different , stretch dependent friction , which is sufficient to generate a non - zero center of mass velocity in a fixed direction . on the basis of this new rectification mechanism",
    "the propulsion in systems as diverse as polar rods on a vibrating surface , dna helicase , and myosin vi on actin , can be understood in a unified way , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to further investigate the new brownian inchworm model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which so far has only been treated perturbatively and numerically .",
    "in particular , we present exact solutions for the average center of mass velocity and the distribution of internal coordinate of the inchworm in the overdamped regime .",
    "the exact solution allows for a strict derivation of some of the perturbative results and shows excellent agreement with simulation data .",
    "furthermore , the effect of a more realistic spring potential , such as the fene spring , is investigated .",
    "the brownian inchworm is described in terms of two coupled langevin equations for the positions of the two beads @xmath0 and @xmath1 under the influence of thermal and nonequilibrium noise @xcite : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the spring potential depending on the relative coordinate @xmath6 for an equilibrium extension @xmath7 .",
    "the crucial ingredient in this model is the stretch dependent friction @xmath8 , acting independently on the two beads .",
    "the thermal noise @xmath9 has gaussian characteristics with zero mean @xmath10 and correlation @xmath11 .",
    "the thermal character is expressed in the prefactor @xmath12 of @xmath9 , stemming from the fluctuation dissipation relation .",
    "likewise , we assume gaussian statistics with zero mean and delta - correlation for the nonequilibrium noise @xmath13 , which , in contrast to the thermal noise , does not satisfy a fluctuation - dissipation relation as it is considered to represent the external nonequilibrium energy input .    the two uncorrelated gaussian processes in eq .",

    "the equations of motion then read @xmath17 where @xmath18    important time scales in this system are the relaxation time of the center of mass velocity and of the fast and slow modes of the relative coordinate .",
    "when the center of mass relaxes much faster than the relative coordinate , the system is effectively in the overdamped regime and the influence of inertia can be neglected .",
    "independent of the precise values of the timescales , it is clear that , in a system where dissipation dominates , the correlation time of the noise is the shortest , that of the velocities is next ( @xmath19 ) , and that of the relative coordinate is the longest ( @xmath20 ) where @xmath21 is the spring constant , @xmath22 is a typical value of the @xmath23-dependent damping , and @xmath24 is a typical mass .",

    "let us consider the case of constant friction on bead @xmath25 while bead @xmath26 experiences",
    "stretch - dependent damping ( increasing for larger stretch ) .",
    "gaussian noise results in a high frequency of stochastic kicks compared with the relaxation rate of the relative coordinate , such that the dimer basically never relaxes while being under the influence of the noise . since bead @xmath25 has a higher mobility it will accumulate a larger displacement than bead @xmath26 whose movement is inhibited with increased stretch . ultimately bead @xmath26 follows bead @xmath25 since this direction is favoured due to the friction and the spring force . in this case",
    "the net effect of the fluctuations is a movement of the center of mass in the negative direction ( see fig .",
    "[ i_fig_inch ] ) .",
    "however , both center of mass velocity and direction of movement depend on the magnitudes of the noise strengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for @xmath29 a current reversal can be observed .",
