    "it is widely believed that the most natural and appealing explanation of the recent neutrino oscillation results is provided by the seesaw mechanism @xcite incorporated into extensions of the standard model that include a local @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the simplest models with local @xmath0 symmetry are the left - right symmetric models @xcite based on the gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "these models have the additional virtue that they explain the origin of parity violation in weak interactions as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in very much the same way as one explains the strength of the weak interaction in the standard model .",
    "stability of the higgs sector under radiative corrections calls for weak scale supersymmetry as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "it has recently been shown that if the mssm is embedded into a left ",
    "right symmetric framework at a high scale @xmath7 gev , as suggested by neutrino oscillation data and by gauge coupling unification , it helps solve some important problems faced by the mssm , viz . , the susy cp problem @xcite , the strong cp problem @xcite and the @xmath8 problem .",
    "supersymmetric models with such a high scale embedding are therefore attractive candidates for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it was noted many years ago @xcite that the electric charge formula of the left ",
    "right symmetric models , @xmath9 , allows one to conclude from pure group theoretic arguments that parity symmetry breaking implies a breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry as well with the constraint that @xmath10",
    ". this simple relation is profoundly revealing .",
    "it says that the neutrinos must be majorana particles since the lepton number breaking terms in the theory must obey @xmath11 selection rule .",
    "this conclusion follows directly if higgs triplets are used to break @xmath12 symmetry since @xmath13 for triplets , it also holds when higgs doublets are used for this purpose , since gauge invariance requires the presence of two such doublets in the mass term for the neutrinos .",
    "secondly , for purely hadronic baryon number violating processes , baryon number must change by at least two units , @xmath14 .",
    "this means that models based on left ",
    "right symmetric gauge structure can lead to the process where a neutron transforms itself into an antineutron ( @xmath2 oscillation@xcite ) , while they may forbid the decay of the proton , which is a @xmath15 process .",
    "while the above group theory argument predicts the existence of @xmath2 oscillation in left ",
    "right symmetric models , its strength will depend on the details of the model . using simple dimensional analysis",
    "it is easy to find that the lowest dimensional operators that contributes to @xmath2 oscillation are six quark operators , a typical one being @xmath16 .",
    "this operator has dimension 9 and therefore the coupling strength scales as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the scale of new physics .",
    "it is natural to identify @xmath18 with the scale of @xmath0 ( or parity ) breaking . the current lower limit on @xmath2 oscillation time , @xmath19 sec @xcite , sec @xcite .",
    "] implies an upper limit @xmath20 gev@xmath21 . for @xmath2 oscillations to be observable",
    "then , the scale @xmath18 should be rather low , @xmath22 gev .",
    "one class of models where @xmath23 transition manifests itself through higgs boson exchange has been discussed in ref .",
    "there it was shown that if the @xmath6 model is embedded into the @xmath24 gauge group , then @xmath2 oscillations can arise at an observable level if the @xmath25 breaking scale is in the 100 tev range . in these models , @xmath2 oscillation amplitude",
    "is intimately tied to an understanding of small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism as well as the breaking of quark  lepton degeneracy implied by @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "the same higgs field that breaks @xmath25 and generates heavy majorana masses for the right  handed neutrinos also mediate @xmath2 oscillations here . with the scale of @xmath25 breaking in the 100 tev range",
    ", these models would appear to be incompatible with gauge coupling unification .",
    "furthermore , such a low scale of parity breaking would not yield naturally neutrino masses in the range suggested by current experiments .",
    "if we raise the scale of parity/@xmath25 breaking to values above @xmath26 gev , so that small neutrino masses in the right range are generated naturally , then @xmath2 transition amplitude becomes unobservably small in these models .",
    "oscillation was noted in the context of a susy @xmath27 model in ref .",
    "these models possess accidental symmetries that lead to light ( @xmath28 gev ) diquark higgs bosons even though the scale of parity violation is high . as a result",
    ", the @xmath2 oscillation operator can have observable strength .",
    "unification of gauge couplings is however difficult to achieve in these models . ]",
    "does the above arguments mean that @xmath2 oscillations are beyond experimental reach based on current neutrino oscillation phenomenology ?",
    "in this letter we will show that this is not the case in a class of attractive seesaw models with local @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we will see that in these models a new class of @xmath29 operators is induced as a consequence of parity breaking .",
    "these operators lead to observable @xmath2 oscillation despite the scale @xmath30 of parity breaking being close to the conventional gut scale of @xmath31 gev .",
    "in fact , @xmath32 increases with @xmath30 and therefore one has the inverse phenomenon that increasing @xmath30 leads to stronger @xmath2 oscillation amplitude .",
    "interestingly , the scale @xmath30 implied by neutrino masses is such that @xmath2 oscillation should be accessible experimentally with a modest improvement in the current limit .",
    "we obtain an _ upper _ limit of @xmath33 sec in this class of models . this prediction becomes sharper in a concrete model where flavor symmetries reduce considerably the uncertainties in the estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that our upper limit is derived in the context of conventional seesaw models of neutrino mass without using any special ingredients to enhance @xmath2 oscillation amplitude .",
    "this should provide new impetus for an improved experimental search for @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "the basic framework of our model involves the embedding of the mssm into a minimal susy left ",

    "the electroweak gauge group of the model , as already mentioned , is @xmath34 with the standard assignment of quarks and leptons  left  handed quarks and leptons ( @xmath35 ) transform as doublets of @xmath36 , while the right  handed conjugate ones ( @xmath37 ) are doublets of @xmath12 .",

    "right symmetry group down to the mssm gauge symmetry .",
    "a singlet @xmath56 is also used to facilitate symmetry breaking in the susy limit .",
    "it has recently been shown that if there exists a @xmath57 r symmetry , the minimal model just described will solve the strong cp problem and the susy phase problem based on parity symmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath8 term will have a natural origin .",
    "one possible @xmath57 assignment was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we present a slight variant , which yields the same superpotential at the renormalizable level as in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus preserves all its success . under this @xmath57 , the superpotential @xmath58 changes sign , as do @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the quark fields @xmath61 are even , while @xmath62 transform as @xmath63 .",

    "the gauge invariant superpotential consistent with this @xmath57 r symmetry at the renormalizable level is    @xmath65    this superpotential breaks the gauge symmetry to that of the standard model in the susy limit without leaving any unwanted goldstone bosons and induces realistic quark masses and mxings .",

    ", first we note that the operator @xmath68 leads to the majorana mass for the right handed neutrino @xmath77 .",
    "the seesaw formula then leads to the relation @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "the operator @xmath72 leads to a @xmath29 operator with strength @xmath79 . leaving aside the details of the flavor structure of @xmath72 and how actually @xmath80 arises",
    ", it is clear that we have a simple linear relation between the neutrino masses and the @xmath2 oscillation time : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a dimensional constant which depends only on the details of weak scale physics and does not involve the high scale @xmath30 .",
    "we will evaluate @xmath82 in the next section .",
    "this simple relation makes it clear that our present knowledge of the neutrino masses allows a direct prediction of the @xmath2 oscillation time in the context of the supersymmetric left - right models broken by doublet higgs fields .",
    "let us now proceed to examine the expected @xmath2 oscillation time resulting from the @xmath29 operator @xmath72 of eq .",
    "an important point to note here is that since @xmath72 is a superpotential term with antisymmetric color contraction it must have antisymmetric flavor contraction as well .",
    "the flavor structure of this operator is then of the type @xmath83 , @xmath84 or @xmath85 in terms of the superfields .",
    "we must then use flavor mixings to obtain the fermionic operator of the type @xmath86 and then the six quark @xmath2 operator . the dominant contribution to",
    "this process comes from the feynman diagram shown in fig . 1 which proceeds through the exchange of a gluino and squarks @xcite and involves two @xmath87 mixings .",

    "( fig1nnbar.epsf width 8 cm )    let us first discuss the origin of the flavor mixing that changes a @xmath84 operator to the required @xmath86 operator .",
    "the dominant source for this in the present context turns out to be the mixing of @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "such mixings occur in the left ",
    "right supersymmetric model since the right  handed quark mixings are physical above the scale @xmath30 .",
    "the renormalization group evolution of the soft susy breaking mass parameters between @xmath95 and @xmath30 will then induce mixings in the right  handed down squark sector proportional to the top ",

    "this is analogous to the rge evolution in the mssm inducing squark mixing in the left  handed down squark sector proportional to the left  handed ckm angles and the top ",
    "quark yukawa coupling .",
    "we estimate this right  handed @xmath87 mixing to be @xmath96 this estimate is obtained by integrating out the rge between @xmath95 and @xmath30 assuming universality of masses at @xmath95 @xcite . since above @xmath30 , both @xmath97 and @xmath98 are part of the same @xmath12 multiplet , unlike in the mssm , @xmath98 yukawa coupling is of order one . in this momentum range ,",
    "quark yukawa coupling reduces the mass of @xmath93 . in going to the physical basis of the quarks",
    ", this effect will induce the squark mixing quoted in eq .",
    "( 5 ) . for the numerical estimate we took @xmath99 and @xmath100 and @xmath101 gev for illustration .",
    "there is a second source of flavor violation that induces @xmath102 mixing in general susy models .",
    "that is the baryon number violating yukawa couplings themselves . if we write in standard notation , the effective @xmath103violating superpotential arising from eq .",
    "( 2 ) as @xmath104 , the rge evolution from planck scale to the weak scale will induce @xmath87 mixing proportional to @xmath105 .",

    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 , we can estimate the induced @xmath91 by integrating the relevant rge @xcite to be @xmath109 recalling that @xmath110 , we see that while this source of flavor mixing may not be negligible , it would be typically smaller than the ones from the right  handed quark mixings of eq .",
    "a third source of flavor violation relevant for @xmath2 oscillations has been identified in ref .",
    "@xcite involving the exchange of the wino .",
    "such diagrams will have an electroweak loop suppression and a chirality suppression necessary to convert the left  handed squark to the right  handed one .",
    "we find that this contribution to @xmath80 has a suppression factor given approximately by @xmath111 ^ 2 \\sim 1 \\times 10^{-9}$ ] ( valid for small @xmath112 ) which is about two orders of magnitude smaller in this class of models compared to the gluino exchange diagram of fig . 1 .",
    "one has to calculate the hadronic matrix element of the six quark operator in order to obtain the @xmath4 .",
    "this has been discussed in several places in the literature@xcite .",
    "the calculations of this `` conversion '' factor can be done using crude physical arguments , according to which one has to multiply the @xmath32 by @xmath113 to obtain @xmath80 where @xmath114 is the baryonic wave function for three quarks inside a nucleon . on dimensional grounds",

    "the mass of @xmath119 can be expressed through the seesaw formula from eq . ( 2 ) as @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the dirac mass of @xmath119 . eliminating the high scale @xmath30 from this",
    ", we have from eq . ( 7 ) , @xmath122    since the value of @xmath123 can be determined from the atmospheric neutrino data under certain assumptions , we conclude that within the seesaw framework , measurement of @xmath2 oscillation will be a measure of the dirac mass of the tau neutrino .",
    "this can then be used as a way to discriminate between models of neutrino masses .    to see the specific prediction for @xmath2 oscillations within the context of the class of models under consideration ,",
    "we need to know the @xmath119 dirac mass . we can estimate it from the following relations for the dirac masses of the third generation quarks and leptons in the susy left ",

    "( 1 ) ( eg : @xmath126 ) and @xmath127 are the vevs of the mssm doublets . from eq . ( 9 ) it follows that in the limit of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we get @xmath130 .",
    "since at such high scales @xmath131 , this predicts @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , we find that unless the two terms in eq .",
    "( 9 ) for @xmath121 are precisely canceled , the dirac mass of @xmath119 will be approximately equal to @xmath133 .    using @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xmath136",
    ", we get a value for the @xmath2 oscillation time which is tantalizingly close to the present experimental lower limit @xcite . for values of @xmath137 10 times smaller than @xmath133 , and taking the supersymmetric particle masses as large as 1 tev",
    ", we see that @xmath4 is less than @xmath138 seconds , case should be about 2 , which would reduce the estimate of @xmath4 by a factor of 2 . ]",
    "which is in the range accessible to a recently proposed experiment @xcite .",
    "it would thus appear that a search for neutron - antineutron oscillation will provide an enormously useful window into neutrino mass models and as such a powerful constraint on the nature of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the prediction for @xmath2 oscillations can be sharpened if we make use of flavor symmetries to determine the coefficients @xmath139 and @xmath140 in eq .",
    "we illustrate this with a specific choice of flavor symmetry @xcite taken to be @xmath141 .",
    "the first two families of fermions form doublets of @xmath142 and have a @xmath143 charge of @xmath144 while the third family fermions are singlets under both groups .",
    "this flavor symmetry is broken by a pair of doublets @xmath145 and singlets @xmath146 . allowing for effective operators suppressed by a scale @xmath18 larger than the vevs of these fields provides a natural explanation of the fermion mass and mixing angle hierarchy .",
    "if we choose @xmath147 and @xmath148 , a resonable fit to all quark and lepton masses is obtained , including neutrinos , for @xmath149 and @xmath150 and all dimensionless couplings being order one @xcite . in this model",
    ", we can estimate the couplings @xmath139 and @xmath140 from the horizontal quantum numbers .",
    "they are @xmath151 and @xmath152 , so that could have been of order one but in the horizontal model or ref .",
    "@xcite , due to large @xmath153 mixing , it is the @xmath154 flavor entry that dominates the atmospheric neutrino mass difference and hence the horizontal suppression factor @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath156 factor is due the fact that the operator must be invariant under @xmath143 . ]",
    "@xmath157 this estimate leads to @xmath158 sec from eq .",
    "( 8) . allowing for uncertainties of order 1 in this estimate , we expect that @xmath4 not to exceed about @xmath159 sec .",
    "before we conclude a few comments are in order :    1 .",
    "the model becomes unacceptable as soon as @xmath160 is embedded into a higher symmetry such as @xmath25 or so(10 ) group because in that case , the @xmath29 operator described in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is accompanied by other r - parity violating operators coming from the same higher dimensional operator @xmath73 due to the higher symmetry .",
    "together , they would lead to unacceptable proton decay rate .",
    "thus observation of @xmath2 oscillation would be a signal of an explicit @xmath160 symmetry all the way upto the planck ( or string ) scale .",
    "2 .   baryogenesis has to proceed through a weak scale scenario since the @xmath29 interactions in the model are in equilibrium down to the tev scale and will wash out any primordial baryon or lepton asymmetry .",
    "we note that the baryon number violating interactions contained in @xmath72 themselves can potentially be the source of weak scale baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the lightest neutralino in this model is unstable and will decay via @xmath161 modes due to the presence of the effective @xmath162 operator @xmath72 .",
    "this prediction is directly testable at colliders .",
    "an alternative candidate for dark matter must be sought .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that in a large class of seesaw models for neutrino masses , despite the high scale of sessaw dictated by the current neutrino oscillation data , neutron ",
    "antineutron oscillation is in the observable range .",
    "in fact , unless the dirac masses of neutrinos are far below those deduced under simple and reasonable assumptions , we predict an upper bound on the neutron - antineutron oscillation time in the range of @xmath163 sec .",
    "this is very close to the present experimental lower limit on @xmath2 oscillations . in the most conservative theoretical scenario ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 oscillation time would be a measure of the dirac mass for the tau neutrino , given the values of squark masses .",
    "this in itself would be an extremely interesting result , since it would discriminate among theoretical models of neutrino masses .",
    "this is apart from the fundamental importance that any observation of baryon number violation will carry .",
    "we therefore strongly urge a new experimental search for neutron  antineutron oscillation .",
