    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is one of the simplest exactly solved models of driven many - particle systems with particle conserving bulk stochastic dynamics @xcite . in the extremely asymmetric case ,",
    "when particles are allowed to move in one direction only , it reduces to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) . for its description in the context of interacting markov processes we refer to @xcite .",
    "in the course of time , asep and tasep became paradigmatic models for understanding the broad variety of nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "devised to model kinetics of protein synthesis @xcite , tasep and its numerous extensions have found many applications to vehicular traffic flow @xcite , biological transport @xcite , one - dimensional surface growth @xcite , forced motion of colloids in narrow channels @xcite , spintronics @xcite , transport of `` data packets '' on the internet @xcite , current through chains of quantum dots @xcite , limit order market @xcite , to mention some .",
    "the stationary properties of the original tasep in continuous time were exactly obtained by different methods .",
    "the first exact solution was based on a recurrence relation , obtained at special values of the parameters in @xcite , and generalized by schtz and domany @xcite . using this recursion ,",
    "closed expressions for the average occupations of all sites were obtained .",
    "the stationary states of tasep and its generalization to a reaction - diffusion process with two - site interactions , were studied also by using the quantum hamiltonian formalism @xcite . a combinatorial approach and",
    "mapping on weighted lattice paths shed new light on the formulation and solution of particle hopping models in continuous and discrete time @xcite .",
    "an effective way to exploit the recursive properties of the steady states of a variety of one - dimensional processes is the matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) . according to the mpa",
    ", the stationary configuration probabilities can be expressed as matrix elements of products of operators representing particles and holes .",
    "such a matrix - product representation of the steady - state probability distribution for tasep was found by derrida , evans , hakim , and pasquier @xcite .",
    "their formalism involves two square matrices , d and e , which are infinite - dimensional in the general case and satisfy a quadratic algebra , known as the dehp algebra .",
    "krebs and sandow @xcite proved that the stationary state of any one - dimensional system with random - sequential dynamics involving nearest - neighbor hopping and single - site boundary terms can always be written in a matrix - product form .",
    "fock representations of the general quadratic algebra were studied by essler and rittenberg @xcite , who found explicit representations in terms of infinite dimensional tridiagonal matrices .",
    "quadratic algebras involved in the mpa for coninuous - time processes were studied also in @xcite    the matrix - product ansatz marked a breakthrough in the solution of tasep / asep in discrete time under periodic as well as open boundary conditions . for the definition of the different types of discrete - time updates we refer to @xcite .",
    "first , by using the mpa , the case of sublattice - parallel update with deterministic bulk dynamics was solved @xcite .",
    "the general case of asep with stochastic sublattice - parallel dynamics was studied in @xcite .",
    "next , the tasep with ordered - sequential update was solved by mapping the corresponding algebra onto the dehp algebra @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the case of parallel update ( simultaneous updating of all sites ) was solved by using two new versions of the matrix - product ansatz .",
    "one of these versions leads to a quartic algebra @xcite , in contrast to the previous cases , in which the algebra is quadratic .",
    "a different representation as a cubic algebra is obtained from a bond - oriented matrix - product ansatz @xcite . in general ,",
    "the mpa has become a powerful method for studying stationary states of different one - dimensional markov processes out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "for example , it was used to solve tasep with a defect particle @xcite , the multi - species tasep with uniform @xcite and inhomogeneous hopping rates @xcite , the discrete - time case with inhomogeneous rates in the bulk @xcite , asep with internal degrees of freedom @xcite .    a powerful technique for studying the dynamics of asep and some of its generalizations is the bethe ansatz .",
    "according to it , the amplitudes of the eigenfunctions of the transfer matrix can be expressed as a nonlinear combination of properly defined plane waves .",
    "this method was used to exactly solve the open asep @xcite , a three - parametric family of hopping probabilities , which includes tasep / asep @xcite , its discrete time versions with inhomogeneous and non local transition rates @xcite , etc .",
    "a modified algebraic bethe ansatz for the continuous - time tasep with open boundaries , based on results known for integrable quantum spin chains , is given in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the properties of the asep depend strongly on the choice of the boundary conditions , similarly to the case of systems with long - range interactions .",
    "this leads to inequivalence of the nonequilibrium statistical properties for open and closed systems .",
    "for instance , the mpa for continuous - time tasep on a ring becomes trivial : the algebra has abelian one - dimensional representation @xcite , while in the case of open boundaries the corresponding matrices are generically infinite - dimensional and non - commuting .",
    "the open system exhibits ( in the thermodynamic limit ) three stationary phases in the plane of particle input - output rates , with continuous or discontinuous transitions between them .",
    "another example is the application the bethe ansatz for obtaining the full current fluctuations in the periodic tasep @xcite , and much later in the periodic asep @xcite .",
    "we mention also , that by using a new form of the bethe ansatz the totally asymmetric exclusion process on a ring was solved for the non - stationary probabilities under arbitrary initial conditions and time intervals @xcite .",
    "the full relaxation dynamics of the tasep on a ring was solved also by the algebraic bethe ansatz method @xcite . for a review of some results obtained for different versions of asep on a ring by using the bethe ansatz we refer to @xcite .",
    "the steady state of tasep with parallel update on the ring has a pair - factorized form and exhibits nearest - neighbor correlations @xcite .",
    "a factorized form of the steady state of asep on a ring was found also in its generalizations including langmuir kinetics for the attachment and detachment transitions of particles on the chain and in a reservoir , as well in the presence of memory reservoirs @xcite . for open boundaries ,",
    "the matrix - product representation was interpreted as a pair - factorized state as on the ring modulated by a matrix - product state @xcite .",
    "an important , exactly solvable generalization of the tasep dynamics on a ring was found and studied by wlki in 2005 @xcite .",
    "that is the exactly solvable representative @xmath7 of the general class of so - called @xmath8-models , under the discrete - time dynamics of which all clusters of particles are updated independently , @xmath8 being the probability that a @xmath9-particle cluster will move as a whole one site ahead .",
    "thus , each particle has its own hopping probability @xmath10 , @xmath11 , depending on its position in the cluster .",
    "it was shown that the model with @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfies the condition for models with discrete - mass transport to have a factorized steady state @xcite . this model , to be denoted here as gtasep , is the main object of study in the present paper ( in our notation @xmath14 ) .",
    "we note that the same model was thoroughly studied in the framework of the bethe integrability in @xcite , as a particular case of the general family formulated and investigated in @xcite .",
    "our main aim here is the construction and application of a finite - dimensional matrix - product representation for the gtasep on finite chains under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the exact expressions for the main characteristics of the stationary state of the model are obtained for arbitrary fixed numbers of the lattice sites @xmath15 and the particles @xmath9 ( @xmath16 ) on the ring .",
    "the correctness of our mpa representation is proved by a parallel combinatorial derivation .",
    "the finite - size two - point correlation function is calculated within the mpa .",
    "the paper is organized in six chapters and three appendices . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the model , sec .",
    "iii presents the matrix - product algebra and its two - dimensional representation . within a combinatorial approach , in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the partition function and the average current of particles in the system .",
    "v contains derivation of the partition function , the average particle density , the current , and the pair correlation function by using the matrix - product formalism . a discussion of the approach , comparison with known results in several particular regimes of the model , as well as perspectives for further applications are given in sec .",
    "explicit results for three small systems are given in appendix  a , and some details of the calculations are presented in appendices  b and c. the main results of the study are published in @xcite .",
    "we consider tasep on a ring of @xmath15 sites , labeled clockwise by the index @xmath17 , where site @xmath18 is the nearest - neighbor of site @xmath15 in the clockwise direction .",
    "each site of the lattice can be empty or occupied by just one particle .",
    "the dynamics of the model corresponds to the discrete - time backward - ordered update with probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 defined as follows .",
    "a particle can hop to a vacant nearest - neighbor site in the clockwise direction , or stay at its place . during each moment of time",
    "@xmath19 , an update of the configuration of the whole system takes place in @xmath15 consecutive steps , passing through successive updates of all the pairs of nearest - neighbor sites in the counterclockwise order @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of a hop along the bond @xmath21 depends on whether a particle has jumped from site @xmath22 to site @xmath23 in the previous step , when the bond @xmath24 was updated , or not .",
    "( 1 ) in the case when the site @xmath22 has not changed its occupation number , the probabilities are the standard ones : if site @xmath22 remains empty , then the jump of a particle from site @xmath25 to site @xmath22 takes place with probability @xmath0 , and the particle stays immobile with probability @xmath26 ; if site @xmath22 remains occupied , no jump takes place and the configuration of the bond @xmath21 is conserved .",
    "\\(2 ) if in the previous step a particle has jumped from site @xmath22 to site @xmath23 , thus leaving @xmath22 empty , then the jump of a particle from site @xmath25 to site @xmath22 in the next step takes place with a different probability @xmath1 , and the particle stays immobile with probability @xmath27 .    note that when @xmath28 one has the standard tasep with backward - sequential update , and when @xmath29 one has the tasep with parallel update .",
    "under the above generalized dynamics , the left - hand site in each pair of nearest - neighbors @xmath21 , which is to be updated , can be either empty or occupied . with these two states we associate the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and introduce the column - vector a =    e + d    .",
    "[ a ] on the other hand , the right - hand site of such a pair @xmath21 can be in three states : empty , being empty in the previous step of the update too , occupied , and empty but as a result of a particle hopping from site @xmath22 to site @xmath23 in the previous update step . with these three states we associate the matrices @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively , and introduce the column - vector @xmath35",
    "thus , the state of the bond @xmath21 to be updated is described by the direct matrix product a . [ 1 ]    we conjecture the same update mechanism for each pair of nearest - neighbor sites as in the case of backward - sequential update , see @xcite , @xmath36 = \\hat{a}\\otimes a. \\label{t}\\ ] ] with the definition ( [ ahat ] ) of @xmath37 , this equation resembles also the stationarity mechanism suggested for the parallel update in @xcite .    the operator @xmath38 in ( [ t ] ) is a @xmath39 matrix , defined by the probabilities of the possible elementary events ( e e ) & = & 1 , + ( e d ) & = & 1 , + ( ef e ) & = & 1 , + ( d fd ) & = & p , + ( d e ) & = & 1-p , + ( df fd ) & = & , + ( df e ) & = & 1- , + ( d d ) & = & 1 . [ events ] here @xmath40 denotes the probability of the event in the brackets .",
    "hence , we obtain the following quadratic algebra : e & = & e+ ef , [ a1 ] + d & = & e , [ a2 ] + fd & = & df + pd , [ a3 ] + e & = & ( 1-p)d+(1-)df , [ a4 ] + d & = & d , [ a5 ] + fe & = & 0 [ a6 ] . the corresponding stochastic matrix @xmath38 has the explicit form =    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 1-p & 0 & 1- + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & p & 0 &    [ 2 ]    to solve the quadratic algebra ( [ a1 ] ) - ( [ a6 ] ) , we make the ansatz = e - f+c_1 , = d+c_2 [ ans ] the constants @xmath41 , @xmath42 , will be determined later . the ansatz solves trivially eq .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) is satisfied under the condition of eq .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) become equivalent .",
    "thus , the algebra reduces to the following three equations : fd = c_1d - c_2e , [ a8 ] pde - ( p-)df= c_1(1-p)d + c_2e , [ a9 ] fe=0 [ a10 ] .    to simplify , we choose @xmath43 and obtain fd = c_1d , [ a11 ] pde - ( p-)df= c_1(1-p)d , [ a12 ] fe=0 [ a13 ] .    a two - dimensional representation of the quadratic algebra ( [ a11 ] ) - ( [ a13 ] ) , depending on four free parameters @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , is provided by the matrices d= = d    1 & 0 + & 0    , e =    e & + 0 & 0    , + f=    0 & f + 0 &    , =    c_1 + e & + 0 & c_1 -    [ 16 ] .",
    "one of the most convenient forms of the above representation is obtained when @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "then , d= =    1 & 0 + & 0    , e =    1 & + 0 & 0    , [ 2par ] f=    0 & 1 + 0 &    .",

    "[ 2parc ] note that , in view of the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) , we have @xmath48 , hence , @xmath49 .",
    "the most important properties of the representation ( [ 2par ] ) are d^2=d , e^2=e,(de)= x,(de)=0 .",
    "[ prop ] in addition , we observe an interesting property of the two - dimensional representation , namely f=(de - d ) = ( e - ed)+ .",
    "[ frep ] inserting the expressions for @xmath34 in terms of the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the algebra ( [ a11]-[a13 ] ) , we obtain the cubic relations : ede = e , ded = d .",
    "[ ] together with @xmath50 , these relations amount to mapping of the quadratic algebra ( [ a11]-[a13 ] ) to the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath51 , which is thus the symmetry algebra of the gtasep on a ring .",
    "the eigenvalues of the degenerate matrix @xmath52 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "hence , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , is the crucial feature used in the following consideration .",
    "thus , the weight @xmath58 of each stationary configuration @xmath59 , given by a string of matrices @xmath60 , where @xmath31 stands for occupied site and @xmath30 for an empty one , * depends only on the number of clusters @xmath61 in that configuration : * w(c ) x^k(c ) .",
    "[ w ]    we note that another choice of the parameters , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , leads to the representation : d= =    1 & 0 + p & 0    , e =    1-p & + 0 & 0    , [ 2parh ] f=    0 & 1 + 0 & p    , hence =    1 & - + 0 & 0    , c= e+d =    2-p & + p & 0    , [ 2parch ] which has been recently derived by p. hrabk in @xcite .",
    "note that this representation does not have all the nice properties ( [ prop ] ) , because now d^2=d , e^2= ( 1-p)e,(de)= 1- .",
    "however , the matrix @xmath52 is degenerate too , with eigenvalues @xmath53 and @xmath64 , and the crucial feature @xmath65 , @xmath57 , holds true .",
    "it seems that in this case the weight of a configuration will depend not only on the number of clusters , but on the number of pairs of holes separating them .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "obviously , in a ring of @xmath15 sites and @xmath9 particles , there are @xmath66 holes , each of which is represented by an @xmath30 matrix .",
    "next , given the number of clusters @xmath67 in a configuration @xmath59 , the same number of @xmath30 matrices are associated with the boundaries @xmath52 between the clusters .",
    "hence , the remaining @xmath68 ` free ' matrices @xmath30 , each having another @xmath30 as a left neighbor , will contribute the factor of @xmath69 , irrespectively of their distribution between the clusters of particles .",
    "thus , the weight of such configuration will be proportional to : w(c ) ( 1-p)^l - nx^k(c ) .",
    "[ w1]by canceling out the configuration - independent factors @xmath70 in the nominator and the denominator ( the partition function @xmath71 ) , one arrives at the same distribution of the configuration probabilities as the one given by ( [ w ] ) .",
    "here we calculate the partition function and the average current within a purely combinatorial approach , involving a detailed analysis of all the possible configurations of a given number of particles on a finite periodic lattice , taking into account their statistical weights ( [ w1 ] ) , and by application of the multinomial theorem .",
    "where possible , we give transparent combinatorial derivation and present the tedious formal derivations in appendix b.      in the matrix - product representation each stationary configuration is represented as a string of the matrices @xmath30 ( for an empty site ) and @xmath31 ( for an occupied site ) , e.g. @xmath72 , with a length equal to the number of lattice sites @xmath15 .",
    "due to the projective properties of these matrices , the weight @xmath73 of a configuration @xmath74 is proportional to the number of clusters @xmath75 in the configuration , and does not depend on any other features of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath76    a more detailed description of @xmath74 is given by its cluster composition , which is represented by a partition @xmath77 of the fixed number of particles @xmath9 : @xmath78 here @xmath77 is a @xmath9-component vector with integer coordinates @xmath79 denoting the number of clusters of size @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 ( obviously , @xmath82 ) .",
    "the total number of clusters in a given configuration @xmath74 equals @xmath83    to calculate the partition function @xmath71 , we have to determine the number of configurations of @xmath9 particles with exactly @xmath84 clusters on the ring of @xmath15 labeled sites , so that @xmath85 . to solve the problem , we start by ordering the elements of the partition @xmath86 into an ordered set @xmath87 , corresponding to the clockwise position on the ring of all the @xmath84 clusters .",
    "then , to each element of @xmath87 we put into one - to - one correspondence an initial configuration , constructed as follows .",
    "first , we choose any of the @xmath84 clusters as the first one , and place its first ( leftmost ) particle at site 1 of the ring .",
    "next , we realize that the number of compositions of the @xmath9 particles into @xmath84 clusters is (    c n-1 + k-1    ) , [ parcomp ] and the composition of the @xmath66 empty sites into the same number @xmath84 of clusters is (    c l- n-1 + k-1    ) .",
    "[ empcomp ] obviously , each of the empty clusters can separate any pair of particle clusters consecutively ordered on the ring after the first one , so the number of configurations with fixed position of the first cluster is given by the product of the numbers ( [ parcomp ] ) and ( [ empcomp ] ) .",
    "finally , restoring the translational invariance of the configurations along the ring , we have to multiply the above number by @xmath15 , because the origin can be taken at any site of the ring , and divide it by @xmath84 , because the origin will @xmath84 times occur at the leftmost site of one the @xmath84 clusters . thus , taking into account that the weight of a configuration is given by eq .",
    "( [ wc ] ) , we obtain the partition function of the model ( @xmath88 ) : @xmath89 where @xmath90 . in the particular cases when there are no particles or no holes on the ring one has to set @xmath91 .",
    "an independent , but rather involved combinatorial proof of the above result is given in appendix  b.    equation ( [ wsk ] ) represents the partition function @xmath92 as a polynomial in @xmath93 .",

    "unfortunately , our matrix representation of the underlying algebra is singular at @xmath263 and we can not cover that case .    in @xcite the stationary properties of the model were obtained by using a mapping onto the zero - range process .",
    "the pair correlation function was derived by using the transfer - matrix method in the grand canonical ensemble with a subsequent choice of the fugacity yielding the prescribed average density of particles in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in contrast , we have worked entirely in the ensemble with a fixed number of particles on a finite ring , which has lead to more involved calculations .",
    "the main aim of the paper was to construct a two - dimensional matrix - product representation for the gtasep and to use it for the derivation of exact finite - size expressions for the partition function , the current of particles and the two - point correlation function .",
    "our results for the partition function and the current were checked against expressions independently derived by combinatorial methods , as well as by comparison with the results of @xcite and the well - known ones for the particular cases of parallel and backward - ordered updates .",
    "the obtained expression for the gtasep partition function is related to the corresponding zrp by the constant factor @xmath107 , just as the densities and the currents of the two processes are related .",
    "this constant factor is due to the different number of configurations in the tasep and zrp .",
    "our main new result is the derivation of the finite - size pair correlation function by the mpa method .",
    "its behavior is analyzed in different regimes of effective attraction and repulsion between the particles , depending on whether @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we have explicitly obtained an analytic expression for the pair correlation function in the limit of irreversible aggregation @xmath6 , which has confirmed the expectation that in that limit the stationary configurations contain just one cluster .    as a future continuation of the present study we intend to attempt the construction of ( infinite - dimensional ) matrix - product representations of the gtasep on open chains .",

    "consider first the problem of the combinatorial calculation of the partition function .",

    "when a configuration contains just one cluster , i.e. @xmath267 , rotations along the ring produce @xmath15 different configurations with that single cluster .",
    "the case @xmath306 is more involved : if some configuration consists of clusters with different size , i.e. , when for at least two different @xmath307 and @xmath308 one has @xmath309 and @xmath310 , then different ordering on the ring of the clusters with different size corresponds to different configurations within the same partition @xmath86 of the number of particles @xmath9 into @xmath84 clusters . on the other hand , permutation of clusters with the same size does not change the configuration , since the particles are indistinguishable .    to solve the problem , we ` closely pack ' all the @xmath84 clusters , preserving their order on the ring .",
    "thus , we obtain an initial configuration in which cluster @xmath80 is separated from cluster @xmath311 , @xmath312 , by exactly one empty site , called the ` front bumper ' of cluster @xmath80 . the number of initial configurations , corresponding to the same partition @xmath86 of @xmath9 into @xmath84 parts , equals the number to different permutations of @xmath84 clusters , among which there are @xmath313 , @xmath314 , indistinguishable clusters of length @xmath80 : @xmath315 obviously , permutations do not change the length of the close - packed configuration , and the bumper of the last ( @xmath84-th ) cluster always occupies site @xmath316 of the ring .",
    "if @xmath317 with some @xmath318 , then we can generate new configurations with the same composition @xmath87 by keeping the first cluster fixed and translating the @xmath84-th one as a hole by @xmath319 sites clockwise ; then the @xmath320-th cluster can be translated by @xmath321 sites , and so on , until we come up to the second cluster and translate it by @xmath322 sites .",
    "therefore , the total number of different configuration with the same composition and fixed position of the first cluster equals @xmath323 with @xmath324 .",
    "some particular values of the above function are : @xmath325    next , we consider rotations along the ring of each initial configuration as a whole .",
    "each time , when the first site of cluster @xmath80 , @xmath326 takes position 1 on the ring , an initial configuration appears , which corresponding to a periodic permutation ( including the identical one ) of the initial cluster arrangement .",
    "the same holds true for each of the @xmath327 configurations , generated from a given initial one by keeping the first segment fixed and relaxing the position of the remaining @xmath328 clusters .",
    "therefore , the total number of different configuration , with the same partition @xmath86 of @xmath9 into @xmath84 parts , is generated by the aperiodic permutations of the initial configuration .",
    "taking into account that the @xmath15 possible positions on the ring of the first segment of each aperiodic configurations produces the factor of @xmath15 , we obtain : @xmath329 now , by using the weight eq .",
