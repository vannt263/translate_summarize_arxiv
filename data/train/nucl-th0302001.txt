    "this paper is concerned with the differences which might arise in reactions initiated by a neutron halo nucleus like @xmath0be and a proton halo nucleus like @xmath1f or @xmath2b .",
    "halo nuclei are a special case of radioactive beams for which the last nucleon is very weakly bound , with separation energies of the order of 0.5 mev or less , and in a state of low angular momentum ( l=0,1 ) .",
    "they exhibit extreme properties like very large total and breakup cross sections .",
    "nuclear and coulomb breakup of neutron halo nuclei have been studied in great detail both experimentally as well as theoretically and are now quite well understood processes @xcite . on the other hand proton halo nuclei such as @xmath2b and @xmath1f are still under investigation .",
    "their behavior as projectiles of nuclear reactions needs to be understood better in particular as @xmath2b is partner in ( p,@xmath3 ) radiative capture reactions of great astrophysical interest for the understanding of the neutrino flux from the sun ( see for example the discussion and references of @xcite ) .",
    "also the existence of a proton halo has sometimes been questioned @xcite and results from different experiments might seem to be contradictory @xcite . for those nuclei",
    "coulomb breakup reactions in the laboratory have been used to get indirect information on the radiative capture , since it has been shown that the coulomb breakup cross section is proportional to the radiative capture cross section @xcite .    in the case of neutrons",
    "the coulomb breakup cross section is largest for heavy targets and the interplay with nuclear breakup is well understood both experimentally as well as theoretically , in particular thanks to the measurements of angular distributions for both processes @xcite .",
    "then @xmath4pb and @xmath5ni have been used as targets with beams of @xmath2b or of @xmath1f at various energies @xcite@xcite-@xcite .",
    "data on lighter targets such as @xmath6be and @xmath7si @xcite also exist . at the same time",
    "a number of theoretical papers have appeared dealing with the problem of the accuracy necessary to interpret the data @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular the problems of higher order effects in coulomb breakup , of the inclusion of e0 , e1 , and e2 multipolarities in the coulomb field and of the relative magnitude of nuclear and coulomb contributions and of their interference have been discussed at length .    a number of experimental papers @xcite have shown that for a @xmath2b projectile it is the nuclear breakup and in particular the stripping ( or absorption ) @xcite component that dominates the experimental cross section . in @xcite a @xmath7si target was used and different beam energies around 40a.mev were explored .",
    "the data of table i of @xcite show that stripping ( 110@xmath8 9 mb ) is very close to the total diffraction ( 112@xmath8 12 mb ) which contains both nuclear and coulomb components . on the other hand at the same beam energy and on the same target the one neutron breakup of @xmath0be , measured by @xcite and calculated by @xcite gave a stripping cross section of 220 mb and a total diffraction of 300 mb of which 120 mb from coulomb breakup .",
    "these results could be considered rather astonishing in view of the fact that the proton in @xmath2b has a separation energy of 0.14 mev while the neutron separation energy in @xmath0be is larger and equal to 0.5 mev . on the other hand the data of @xcite for the breakup of @xmath2b on @xmath4pb at 142a.mev provided a one - proton removal cross section of 744@xmath89 mb of which",
    "about 300 - 450 mb were estimated to be due to nuclear breakup and 311 mb to coulomb breakup .",
    "this is again a surprising result because for the system @xmath0be+@xmath4pb at 120a.mev it was calculated in @xcite that the cross sections would be 321 mb for nuclear breakup and 1050 mb for coulomb breakup , the model of @xcite being very reliable as it agrees with exclusive data @xcite .",
    "similarly , the recent data from gsi @xcite at the relativistic beam energy of 936 a.mev give for the one proton removal cross section of @xmath2b on @xmath4pb and @xmath9c , 662@xmath860 mb and 94@xmath88 mb respectively while at a similar energy ( 790a.mev ) the one neutron removal from @xmath0be on the same targets was 960@xmath860 mb and 169@xmath84 respectively @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , very recently a new theoretical work has appeared where the authors treat the nuclear breakup of @xmath1f to first order @xcite , contrary to what it has been established in the literature , namely that halo breakup should be treated to all orders in the neutron - target interaction .",
    "an a posteriori justification of the approach of bertulani and danielewicz @xcite is that the calculated nuclear breakup is larger by several orders of magnitude than the coulomb breakup .",
    "in fact the approach of @xcite can be justified with the results of another theoretical work by esbensen and bertsch @xcite on the proton halo nucleus @xmath2b , where it was shown that starting from about 40 a.mev in the reaction @xmath10 , dynamical calculations and first order perturbation theory with or without far field approximation , yields nearly the same coulomb breakup cross sections for distances of closest approach for the core target trajectory of 20 fm or larger .",
    "also in @xcite the same authors found that for @xmath1f nuclear diffraction and coulomb breakup have very similar probabilities to occur and the values are also close to those for nuclear stripping .",
    "an earlier calculation by esbensen and hencken @xcite showed that nuclear one proton removal cross sections for a @xmath2b projectile would be larger than coulomb cross sections up to target mass a@xmath11=100 .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by dasso , lenzi and vitturi @xcite .    in order to get some insight into the peculiarities of the proton halo reactions , in particular in comparison to neutron halos , we introduce here an effective treatment of proton single particle states which simplifies their treatment and makes them behaving as neutrons .",
    "related approaches have recently been introduced by other authors @xcite .",
    "we do not propose our method as opposed to dynamical calculations , but we are simply concerned with the understanding of the underlying physics and the interpretation of numerical results from more sophisticated methods such as direct solutions of the schrdinger equation or coupled channels .",
    "we show in the following how to treat proton transfer and breakup in a way that is similar to neutron transfer and breakup by using an effective potential in which the weakly bound protons behave as  normally \" bound neutrons and then we come to some simple conclusions .",
    "the basic idea is that breakup is a kind of  transfer to the continuum \" and as such its main features come from matching conditions and q - value effects @xcite .",
    ", @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ]",
    "we begin this section by noticing the differences in the treatment of a neutron halo breakup and a proton halo breakup . in ref.@xcite",
    "the neutron breakup was studied to all orders in the nuclear and coulomb fields .",
    "the nuclear potential responsible for the neutron transition to the continuum was taken to be the neutron - target optical potential .",
    "on the other hand it was shown that coulomb breakup originates from an effective repulsive force acting on the neutron and due to the core - target coulomb potential . if we were to extend the same model to proton breakup we should add the two coulomb interactions of the proton itself with its core in the initial state and with the target in the final state .",
    "now , because of the slow variation of the coulomb field , we can use the adiabatic approximation or frozen halo @xcite , for these two coulomb interactions which make the proton breakup different from the neutron breakup .",
    "the detailed derivation of the formalism is given in the appendix .",
    "the effect of the proton - core and proton - target coulomb potentials can be understood qualitatively by discussing fig . 1 which shows the potentials felt by a neutron ( dashed line ) and a proton ( full line ) in @xmath2b , @xmath1f , @xmath5ni and @xmath4pb .",
    "supposing the two particles have the same binding energy @xmath15 the proton wave function inside the potential of fig .",
    "1 is like a neutron wave function with binding energy @xmath16 up to the radius @xmath17 .",
    "the proton potential is like the neutron potential pushed up by @xmath18 where @xmath17 is the barrier radius . for any given nucleus",
    "this radius is rather larger than the nuclear or coulomb radius values usually quoted in the literature .",
    "but from fig . 1 one can see that it is the value corresponding to the barrier peak .",
    "we give these values in table i , together with the experimental binding energies of the halo state in @xmath2b and of two states in @xmath1f .",
    ".3 in    .barrier radii from fig . 1 and initial binding energies . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it appears also clear that under such conditions coulomb and nuclear breakup could not need to be calculated to all orders .",
    "also the effect of the  effective parameters \" introduced here has to be studied in more detail and results should be compared to full dynamical calculations .",
    "in this paper we have tried to draw the attention to the physical origins of the differences in the behavior in a reaction of a proton halo nucleus as compared to a neutron halo .",
    "we have shown that if the target is heavy , but also if the projectile is heavier , as in the case of @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 there is an effective barrier which makes the proton  effectively \" bound by several mev , so that some typical halo features might change in breakup reactions . in particular nuclear breakup and its stripping component could be of comparable magnitude as coulomb breakup .",
    "this could explain the apparent discrepancy in the interpretation in terms of halo structure between data from different types of experiments .",
    "also first order calculations are not completely unjustified",
    ". therefore approaches of the type used in @xcite although not very accurate would give reasonable order of magnitude predictions for weakly bound protons interacting with a heavy target but not for interactions with light targets or in the case of neutron breakup .",
    "it is known that coulomb breakup on a heavy target can be useful to simulate the ( p,@xmath3 ) reactions of astrophysical interest . however , exclusive measurements need to be done to separate coulomb from nuclear breakup . measuring proton angular distributions",
    "as done in @xcite for neutron would help disentangling the dominant reaction mechanism , but also separating the large core - target impact parameter contributions as done in @xcite is very useful .",
    "* acknowledgments *    this work was initiated while one of us ( a.b ) was visiting the theory group of the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university .",
    "she wishes to thank in particular p. gregers hansen , pawel danielewicz , betty tsang and bill lynch for the very warm and stimulating atmosphere and the hospitality extended to her .",
    "we consider the breakup of a proton halo nucleus like @xmath1f consisting of a proton bound to a @xmath21o core in a collision with a target nucleus .",
    "the system of the halo nucleus and the target is described by jacobi coordinates @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the position of the center of mass of the halo nucleus relative to the target nucleus and @xmath24 is the position of the neutron relative to the halo core , and the coordinate @xmath23 is assumed to move on a classical path .",
    "this allows target recoil to be included in a consistent way .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the kinetic energy operators associated with the coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath28 is the potential describing the interaction of the proton with the core , and it contains nuclear and coulomb parts .",
    "the potential @xmath29 describes the interaction between the projectile and the target .",
    "it is a sum of two parts depending on the relative coordinates of the proton and the target and of the core and the target@xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the proton mass , @xmath34 is the mass of the projectile core and @xmath35 is the projectile mass . both @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "are represented by complex optical potentials .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath36 describes absorption of the proton by the target to form a compound nucleus .",
    "it gives rise to the stripping part of the halo breakup .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath37 describes reactions of the halo core with the target .",
    "the potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 also includes the coulomb interaction between the proton and the target and the halo core and the target . this part of @xmath37 is responsible for coulomb breakup .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath38 is small for a halo nucleus with a heavy core .",
    "for example @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the case of @xmath41f .",
    "this property is used here to approximate the proton - target and core - target potentials by      the halo breakup is caused by the direct proton target interaction @xmath36 or by a recoil effect due to the core - target interaction .",
    "coulomb breakup of a one - proton halo nucleus is mainly a recoil effect due the coulomb component @xmath37 of the core - target interaction and is contained in @xmath43 .",
    "it is proportional to the mass ratio @xmath38 .",
    "the theory in this paper is based on a time dependent approach which can be derived from an eikonal approximation . the projectile motion relative to the target",
    "is described by a time - dependent classical trajectory @xmath44 with constant velocity @xmath45 and impact parameter @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is a unit vector parallel to the z - axis ) . as discussed in ref.@xcite the main effect of @xmath48",
    "is to give an absorption for small core - target impact parameters and thus it reduces the core survival probability .    then with the approximations ( [ vnt],[vnc ] ) to the potentials",
    "the wave function @xmath49 describing the dynamics of the halo proton satisfies the time - dependent equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hamiltonian for the halo nucleus . in the present paper",
    "we neglect the nuclear part of final state interactions between the proton and the halo core , but include the coulomb proton - core interaction @xmath52 and the final state interactions between the proton and the target . this approximation should be satisfactory unless there are resonances in the proton - core final state interaction which are strongly excited during the reaction .",
    "the proton - core potential does not act dynamically and it can not cause breakup . it gives the maximum contribution at the top of the proton - core barrier where @xmath53 .",
    "therefore we take it constant as @xmath54 .      thus in the case of a proton breakup and for a heavy target , besides the proton target nuclear potential it is necessary to include in the total hamiltonian the proton - core , proton - target and core - target coulomb potentials . the proton - target potential and the core - target potential",
    "are included dynamically but the effect on the center of mass has to be subtracted .",
    "we have then @xmath58 where charges and masses are : core ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) , halo ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) , target ( @xmath63,@xmath64 ) .",
    "we used also two ratios : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "now we approximate @xmath68 with something simpler .",
    "one approach is to make the dipole expansion .",
    "this is quite good for the core - target recoil term because @xmath69 is small , but is less good for the halo - target term because @xmath70",
    ". it would be good for large separations when @xmath71 .",
    "another possibility is to make a dipole approximation rather than a dipole expansion .",
    "it means making an approximation to @xmath68 which is reasonable over the region of the projectile by writing @xmath72 and choosing @xmath73 and @xmath74 so that , when @xmath75 and @xmath76 are alligned , the approximation fits the exact expression eq.([eq4 ] ) at @xmath77 , at the barrier tops on the left and right of the projectile ( see fig .",
    "thus we put @xmath78 in other words @xmath73 is the average of @xmath68 at the points @xmath77 , on the left and right sides of the projectile ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in this way",
    "the maximum contribution of the proton - target coulomb potential @xmath79 is taken into account to all orders .",
    "the constant @xmath74 is chosen so that @xmath80 in the limit when @xmath81 is very large the dipole expansion is good and we have @xmath82 , @xmath83 . for smaller values of @xmath81",
    "the approximate form of @xmath68 fits the exact coulomb potential near the left and right barriers of the projectile .",
    "the constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 are dependent on @xmath81 but in the calculations one would use the values at the point of closest approach in the path of relative motion .",
    "\\2 ) because the approximate form of @xmath68 is a dipole field the breakup can be calculated by the methods used for neutron breakup .",
    "the only differences would be the effective strengths @xmath74 and the effective binding energy in the initial state @xmath85 .            and the final proton wave function @xmath89 satisfies the equation@xmath90 with @xmath91 @xmath56 would just be the nuclear part of the proton - target final state interaction and the boundary condition that @xmath92 when @xmath93 is large .        with a new @xmath97 equation ( [ amp2 ] )",
    "is formally the same as the neutron breakup amplitude of ref.@xcite with the difference that the effect of the halo charge has been included in the effective energy @xmath98 .",
