    "the spectral states and the correlated timing properties of neutron star and black hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be very useful to understand the extreme environments of these sources @xcite .",
    "an excellent way to study these properties is to track these sources in the colour - colour diagram ( cd ; hard colour ( hc ) vs. soft colour ( sc ) ) and in the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ; hard colour vs. intensity ; see   [ dataanalysisandresults ] ) . from the beginning of an outburst ,",
    "the intensity of a transient black hole source increases , typically keeping the hc at a near - constant value .",
    "near the highest intensity the hc value quickly decreases , followed by an intensity decrease at a lower hc value , and a soft - to - hard transition at a lower intensity value .",
    "thus a black hole lmxb typically traces a ` q'-like hysteresis curve in the hid @xcite .",
    "it is usually believed that neutron star lmxbs do not trace hysteresis curves in cd / hids @xcite .",
    "for example , the near - eddington z sources trace out roughly ` z ' shaped tracks on time scales of hours to a day , while the less luminous atoll sources have ` c ' shaped tracks @xcite .",
    "the lower hc banana - like portion ( bs ) of the ` c ' track can be divided into upper banana ( ub ) , lower banana ( lb ) and lower left banana ( llb ) based on spectral and timing properties .",
    "the bs is traced out on time scales of hours to a day without any hysteresis @xcite . on the other hand , the higher hc extreme island state ( eis )",
    "is traced out in days to weeks , and secular motions in the form of parallel tracks are seen in eis .",
    "an atoll source moves from eis to bs via an island state ( is ) .",
    "probably the only transient atoll source showing a ` q'-like hysteresis hid curve is aql x-1 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for 4u 163653 tracks ) .",
    "such neutron star lmxbs , and more importantly sources showing intermediate tracks between ` q ' and ` c ' , can be very useful ( 1 ) to unify the black hole and neutron star accretion processes , and ( 2 ) to sort out the mismatch between the standard eis - is - bs framework and the general hysteresis phenomena . in this letter",

    "we have analyzed the low - frequency power spectra of each phase using all the pca event - mode data with a standard technique @xcite .",

    "we have fitted the continuum component of a power spectrum with a constant+powerlaw model ( describing white and red noises , respectively ) and any narrow feature with a lorentzian .",

    "while the non - photospheric - radius - expansion ( non - pre ) bursts occured in the hard state , the pre bursts and the khz qpo appeared in phase 8 ( table 1 ) .",
    "in this letter , we have studied the evolution of spectral states of the neutron star lmxb exo 1745248 .",
    "we tentatively conclude that it is an atoll source because of the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) from the spectral fitting , we find that the observed @xmath27 kev unabsorbed source flux varied in the range @xmath28 ergs @xmath29 s@xmath30 .",
    "such a large intensity variation does not happen in a source , which shows an exclusive ` z ' behaviour @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the hard colours ( fig .",
    "[ hid ] ) of exo 1745248 are consistent with those of atoll sources , but different from z sources @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the source shows parallel tracks for the higher hard colour values in hid ( fig .",
    "[ hid ] ) , which are typical of atoll sources @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) shape of the cd track for lower hard colour values looks like a banana ( fig .",
    "[ ccd ] ) .",
    "( 5 ) hard state to soft state transition of the source was plausibly quick @xcite .",
    "( 6 ) pre bursts were found in the softer state ( fig .",
    "[ ccd - hid ] ) , as usually observed for fast spinning neutron star lmxbs @xcite .",
    "( 7 ) the khz qpo was observed in the transitional state ( plausibly lb / llb ) , which is usual for atolls @xcite .",
    "( 8) vlfn at @xmath31 hz was observed in bs , and @xmath1 hz peaked noise was detected in the transitional state ( plausibly lb / llb ) , which are usual for atolls @xcite .",
    "( 9 ) red noise rms is higher in the hard state @xcite .",
    "however , although we can not confirm , there is some chance that at the most intense state , the source transformed into a z source ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because , the estimated source luminosity in this state was @xmath32 times the eddington luminosity @xcite , for a @xmath27 kev flux of @xmath33 ergs @xmath29 s@xmath30 , and assuming a 5.5 kpc source distance , 1.4 m@xmath34 neutron star mass , 6.0 stellar radius - to - mass ratio and ionized hydrogenic accreted matter .",
    "exo 1745248 is very interesting , unusual and important for the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the source exhibited a clear overall clockwise hysteresis in hid and cd ( fig .",
    "[ hid ] and [ ccd ] ) .",
    "a local anti - clockwise hysteresis is also observed in the high intensity state ( plausibly ub ) .",
    "( 2 ) in the hard state ( plausibly eis ) , unlike a typical atoll , the hard colour changed largely , and no horizontal track is present at the highest hard colour in hid @xcite . moreover",
    ", the hard - to - soft transition involved a large change in intensity , unlike several black hole sources .",
    "these caused an hid - track - shape intermediate between atoll ` c ' tracks and black hole ` q ' tracks .",
    "( 3 ) in cd / hid , the source moved from eis to ub , while usually an atoll moves to lb / llb from eis @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the cd / hid tracks of exo 1745248 could be segmented in time ( fig .",
    "[ hid ] and [ ccd ] ) .",
    "several segments can be distinguished by timing properties ( fig .",
    "[ lf - powspec ] ) , which shows that these segments are actually in different states , i.e. , not in the same state shifted by secular motions .",
    "the source typically dwells in a segment for a few days to about a month ( table 1 ) .",
    "( 5 ) exo 1745248 took at least 2.5 months to trace the bs , as opposed to a few hours to a day , which is typical for an atoll source @xcite .",
    "the cd / hid hysteresis tracks of exo 1745248 could be very useful to relate the accretion processes in neutron star systems and black hole systems (   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "finally , the hid hysteresis track of exo 1745248 , which is intermediate between the ` q'-like hysteresis track of aql x-1 and ` c'-like non - hysteresis tracks of most atoll sources , suggests that the popular eis - is - bs framework of ` c'-like tracks might be a special case of a more general hysteresis behaviour .",
    "however , observations of more such intermediate sources are required to verify this ."
