    "low - dimensional systems have long been the subject of intensive research , both on their fundamental properties and on possible applications . in this respect the recent production of atom - thick crystal carbon layers ( graphene ) has raised the possibility of the development of new graphene - based devices that exploit its unusual electronic and mechanical properties ( for a recent review see ref .  ) .",
    "the electronic spectrum of defect - free single - layer graphene is gapless and , together with the chiral aspect of the carriers in this system , leads to a perfect transmission through an arbitrarily high and wide potential barrier , i.e. , the klein paradox@xcite .",
    "that can be avoided if a gap is introduced in the electronic spectrum and may be necessary for certain applications , e. g. , for improving the on / off ratio in carbon - based transistors .",
    "there are a few methods to introduce a gap in the spectrum of graphene .",
    "one of them is to use nanoribbons in which a bandgap @xcite arises due to the lateral confinement . also , depositing graphene on a substrate such as boron nitride was found recently to result in a bandgap@xcite of @xmath1 mev . in bilayer",
    "graphene@xcite a gap can be introduced by applying a bias between the two layers or by doping one of them such that a potential difference results between the layers @xcite . changing the bias in the latter case can open and close the gap dynamically which is interesting for transistor applications .",
    "nanostructured gates can thus allow the creation of quantum dots on bilayer graphene @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the electronic properties of a biased bilayer in which the potential difference between the two layers is changed periodically .",
    "such a superlattice ( sl ) , which can be created by applying gates to the bilayer , is of interest as it shows how a one - dimensional band structure may appear in such a system .",
    "an additional motivation is that curvature effects of corrugated single - layer graphene lead to an effective periodic potential resembling that of a sl@xcite .",
    "although in a bilayer this effect would be weaker , since the bilayer is less bendable than a single layer , it might still be important .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly shows the basic formalism . in sec .",
    "iii results for the transmission and conductance through a finite number of barriers are presented .",
    "section iv shows results for the dispersion relation and the density of states in sls in bilayer graphene .",
