    "in 1953 f. s. beckman and d. a. quarles characterized isometries of @xmath2-dimensional euclidean spaces under a surprisingly mild condition when @xmath3 ( see @xcite or @xcite for alternative proofs ) . namely , they managed to show that every transformation @xmath4 which preservers unit euclidean distance in one direction is an ( affine ) isometry .",
    "they also noted that on @xmath5 or on an infinite dimensional , real hilbert space the same conclusion fails .",
    "many mathematicians have been trying to generalize this beautiful theorem .",
    "the problem of characterizing those finite dimensional real normed spaces @xmath0 such that every transformation @xmath1 which preserves the unit distance in one direction is an isometry was raised , in this general form , by a. d. aleksandrov and hence it is called the aleksandrov conservative distance problem ( see @xcite ) . in the literature",
    "these spaces are also called beckman - quarles type spaces . as far as we know",
    ", the original version of aleksandrov problem was solved only for a few concrete normed spaces ( see @xcite concerning @xmath6-norms , and @xcite where the norm is not strictly convex ) , all of them are two - dimensional .",
    "some general results are known for modified versions , for instance in @xcite w. benz and h. berens investigated the case when the transformation preservers distance 1 and @xmath2 for some @xmath7 .",
    "we also mention the paper @xcite of t. m. rassias and p. emrl where they assumed that @xmath8 is onto and it preserves distance 1 in both directions .",
    "they showed that in this case @xmath8 is not very far from being an isometry .",
    "several other results are known which are connected to the aleksandrov problem .",
    "the reader can find a number of them in the references .",
    "the original version remained unsolved even for the very special case when @xmath9 and the norm is strictly convex . here",
    "we present a unified approach which solves the aleksandrov problem in two dimensions for a much larger class of norms , which we will call urtc - norms .",
    "let us point out that the naive conjecture that every at least two but finite dimensional normed space is a beckman - quarles type space is false .",
    "however , as far as we know , counterexamples are only known in the simple case when the unit ball of the norm is a linear image of a cube ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since we will consider only two - dimensional normed spaces over @xmath5 , we can investigate @xmath10 endowed with a norm @xmath11 .",
    "we say that the norm is strictly convex , if its sphere @xmath12 does not contain any non - degenerated line segment .",
    "if three points @xmath13 satisfy @xmath14 for some @xmath15 , then these points are said to be in a regular @xmath16-position .",
    "we introduce the following notion .",
    "we call @xmath11 a urtc - norm ( unique regular triangle constructibility ) if for every @xmath17 the equation system @xmath18 is satisfied exactly for two points @xmath19 .",
    "since the function @xmath20 is continuous on @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the existence of such an @xmath24 which fulfilles is trivial .",
    "obviously , if @xmath24 satisfies , then @xmath25 fulfilles it as well .    by translation , we may have assumed that @xmath26 , and by multiplying with a non - zero scalar , we may have replaced 1 by any @xmath27 in definition 1 .",
    "we note that for the @xmath28 norm , one can find two points @xmath29 with @xmath30 such that holds for infinitely many points @xmath31",
    ". we will provide a useful characterization of urtc - norms in lemma [ urtc_lem ] .",
    "our main theorem , which reads as follows and will be proven in section [ proof_sec ] , provides an affirmative answer for the aleksandrov conservative distance problem for urtc - noms .",
    "[ main_thm ] let @xmath11 be a urtc - norm on @xmath10 , and let us consider an arbitrary transformation @xmath32 such that @xmath33 then @xmath8 is an affine isometry .",
    "we will need several lemmas before proving theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "we note that theorem [ main_thm ] can be considered as a mazur - ulam type result in two dimensions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us point out that quite the same proof works for the case if we consider two different urtc - norms on the initial and final spaces .",
    "however , dealing with the above version makes notations much simpler .",
    "furthermore , by affinity , the modified version of our main theorem says in many cases ( in fact when the unit circles of these norms are not linear images of each other ) that no transformation @xmath8 exists which preserves the unit distance .",
    "we begin with a characterization of urtc - norms . the symbols @xmath34 $ ] and",
    "@xmath35 will denote the line segment @xmath36 and the line @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "[ urtc_lem ] the following conditions are equivalent for any norm @xmath11 on @xmath10 :    * @xmath11 is not a urtc - norm , * two points @xmath38 exist such that @xmath39\\subseteq s$ ] .    in particular , every strictly convex norm is a urtc - norm .",
    "( ii)@xmath40(i ) : set @xmath41 and @xmath42 . then every @xmath43 $ ] satisfies .",
    "therefore the norm can not be urtc .",
    "( i)@xmath40(ii ) : since the norm does not have the urtc property , there exists a point @xmath44 such that at least three different solutions can be given which satisfy with @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , none of them can lie on @xmath45 .",
    "therefore at least two of them , @xmath24 and @xmath46 , lies on the same open side of @xmath45 .",
    "first , we show that @xmath47 . assuming the contrary",
    ", we can suppose , without loss of generality , that @xmath24 lies between @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "clearly @xmath49\\cup[y , y - b]\\cup[y - b ,-",
    "b]$ ] , but since @xmath50 holds , we get @xmath51 $ ] . on the one hand ,",
    "if @xmath24 lies on the opposite closed side of @xmath52 than @xmath53 , then @xmath24 has to be in the interior of @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 , this is impossible . on the other hand , if @xmath24 lies on the opposite side of @xmath56 than @xmath57 , then @xmath58 has to be in the interior of @xmath59 which is again a contradiction .",
    "therefore , indeed @xmath47 is satisfied .",
    "now , we may suppose that @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 are distinct collinear points of the unit sphere , we easily obtain that @xmath62\\subseteq s$ ] and @xmath63 , which completes the proof of this part .",
    "the shorter closed and open arcs of @xmath12 between two non - antipodal points @xmath64 will be denoted by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "we provide some basic properties of urtc - norms in the following lemma .",
    "[ basic_lem ]    * let @xmath11 be a urtc - norm . if @xmath67 such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 is positively oriented , then we have @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "* let @xmath11 be an arbitrary norm .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 is satisfied , then there exists a point @xmath75 which fulfilles @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "( i ) : clearly we have @xmath78 , and by the urtc property @xmath79\\cup[d , a+d ] ) = \\emptyset$ ] is valid .",
    "elementary observations show that if the euclidean distance between @xmath53 and @xmath80 is less than or equal to the distance of @xmath81 and @xmath80 , then @xmath82 holds .",
    "this implies @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath84 and @xmath85 $ ] , and hence @xmath86\\subseteq s$ ] is satisfied .",
    "since our norm is urtc , we obtain @xmath71 .",
    "the other case can be shown similarly .",
    "( ii ) : we consider the continuous function @xmath87 .",
    "since we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we conclude the existence of a point @xmath75 such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 holds .",
    "we define the functions @xmath90 such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are positively oriented . by the urtc property ,",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 are well - defined , moreover , we clearly have @xmath96 , and hence @xmath94 and @xmath95 are bijective",
    ". we proceed with showing that @xmath94 is continuous .",
    "the function @xmath94 is continuous .",
    "we assume indirectly that @xmath94 is not continuous , and without loss of generality we may suppose that @xmath97 is a point of discontinuity .",
    "we set @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "a quite straightforward application of lemma [ basic_lem ] gives the following monotonicity property of @xmath94 : if @xmath100 , then we have @xmath101 . by this monotonicity property",
    "we obtain that there are two points @xmath102 and @xmath103 such that either @xmath104 , or @xmath105 .",
    "both of them contradicts to the bijectivity of @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath15 .",
    "we call the 7-tupple @xmath106 a @xmath16-probe if @xmath107 holds ( @xcite , see also figure 1 ) . by the following lemma ,",
    "any three points which are in a regular @xmath16-position can be extended to a @xmath16-probe .",
    "an edge represents that the distance between the endpoints is exactly @xmath16 . ]",
    "[ probe_lem ] let @xmath11 be a urtc - norm , and let @xmath108 such that @xmath109 .",
    "then the 3-tupple @xmath110 can be extended to a @xmath16-probe @xmath111 , where we necessarily have @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , @xmath113 holds .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath110 is positively oriented .",
    "let us define @xmath114 which is trivially continuous and @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , by the triangle inequality we obtain @xmath116 @xmath117 which immediately implies the existence of a @xmath118 such that @xmath119 .",
    "we define @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the ordered 7-tupple @xmath111 is trivially a @xmath16-probe .    in the above construction we chose @xmath123 to be @xmath124",
    "now , we show that this is the only choice .",
    "since the norm is urtc , the first line of ( with @xmath26 ) implies @xmath125 .",
    "suppose that @xmath126 happens .",
    "since @xmath127 , we obtain @xmath128 .",
    "but from @xmath129 we conclude @xmath130\\subseteq d\\cdot s$ ] , which clearly contradicts the urtc property .",
    "therefore we indeed have @xmath112 .",
    "now , we are in the position to present the proof of the main result of this paper .",

    "let @xmath131 be arbitrary three points which are in a regular @xmath16-position .",
    "let us consider a @xmath16-probe @xmath132 which exists by lemma [ probe_lem ] and where @xmath133 . clearly , the 7-tupple @xmath134 @xmath135 is a @xmath16-probe as well , and therefore @xmath136 is satisfied",
    ". set @xmath137 .",
    "considering @xmath138 instead of @xmath139 , by the previous observations we conclude @xmath140 .",
    "this immediately implies that distance @xmath141 is also preserved , moreover , when @xmath142 are collinear such that @xmath143 and @xmath144 , then the same hold for their images .",
    "iterating the above method we can easily prove also the following statement : distance @xmath145 is also preserved for every @xmath146 , furthermore , when @xmath13 are collinear such that @xmath147 and @xmath148 , then the same is valid for their images .",
    "in particular , @xmath8 preserves distance @xmath2 for all @xmath146 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "next , we show that assuming distance @xmath16 is preserved implies that distance @xmath149 is preserved as well for every @xmath146 .",
    "let @xmath150 .",
    "by lemma [ basic_lem ] , there exists a point @xmath75 such that @xmath151 . set @xmath152 and @xmath153 . obviously , we have @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    ". therefore we have @xmath156 , @xmath157 , moreover , @xmath158 are collinear and @xmath159 are collinear .",
    "this implies @xmath160 , and thus @xmath161 .",
    "( see figure 3 ) .    by the above observations",
    ", we immediately obtain that @xmath8 preserves all rational distances .",
    "let @xmath29 be two arbitrary different points .",
    "for every @xmath162 we can find @xmath163 such that @xmath164 and @xmath165 . by lemma [ basic_lem ]",
    "we can find such a point @xmath75 which satisfies @xmath166 . since",
    "rational distances are preserved by @xmath8 , we get @xmath167 , and by the triangle inequality @xmath168 since this holds for every @xmath162 , we conclude @xmath169 , which means that @xmath8 is indeed an isometry .",
    "since isometries are continuous , affinity of @xmath8 follows from the preservations of midpoints which was pointed out before .",
