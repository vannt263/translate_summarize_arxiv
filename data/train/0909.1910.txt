    "the behavior of atoms , molecules and ions placed in a strong magnetic field has attracted a significant attention during the last two decades ( see , for example , the review papers @xcite ) .",
    "it is motivated by both pure theoretical interest and by possible practical applications in astrophysics and solid state physics . from the point of theory",
    ", such studies would lead to a creation of a theory of atoms and molecules in a magnetic field similar to a standard atomic - molecular physics . in practice ,",
    "even the basic elements of such a theory - a knowledge of the energy levels of the simplest coulomb systems which can exist in a magnetic field - can be important for interpretation of the spectra of white dwarfs ( where a surface magnetic field ranges in @xmath5 g ) and neutron stars where a surface magnetic field varies in @xmath6 g , and can be even @xmath7 g for the case of magnetars .",
    "it was conjectured long ago @xcite that unusual chemical compounds can appear in a strong magnetic field . in particular ,",
    "it was suggested by m ruderman @xcite and then developed by his followers ( see @xcite and references therein ) that the presence of a strong magnetic field can lead to the formation of linear hydrogenic neutral molecules ( linear chains ) situated along magnetic lines .",
    "it was assumed that in the ground state all electrons are in the same spin state with all spins antiparallel to the magnetic field line . to avoid a contradiction with the pauli principle it was further assumed that all electrons have different magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "it was considered as a characteristics of the ground state .",
    "it seems obviously correct in the case of atoms and atomic ions where the electrons are close to each other .",
    "however , it is not that obvious for the case of molecules where the electrons are situated in far distant places in space . all of them ( or , at least , some of them ) can be in the same quantum state , with the same spin projection and magnetic quantum number @xcite . this situation was observed in @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite , where in a domain of large magnetic fields the ground state was given by the state of the maximal total spin but with the electrons having the same zero magnetic quantum number ( see a discussion below ) . in @xcite",
    "qualitative arguments were presented that such chains can be of any length , thus , can contain arbitrary many protons .",
    "it seems that such a picture is oversimplified , it intrinsically assumes that the magnetic field is `` infinitely '' strong .",
    "for instance , for any exotic chain ( which does not exist in field - free case ) there must be a certain threshold magnetic field since that it begins to exists .",
    "it can well happen that such a threshold magnetic field can be beyond of realistic magnetic fields which occur in nature .",
    "this phenomenon is absent in the qualitative theory @xcite .",
    "thus , some very general features of the ruderman s picture only , like growth of the binding energies , shrinking of the size of the molecules with a magnetic field increase and maximal total electronic spin can hold for realistic high magnetic fields .",
    "it is well known that in absence of a magnetic field , in general , the hydrogenic linear chains ( polymers ) do not exist with the only exception of two shortest ones , @xmath10 and @xmath8.-ion exists in triangular geometry ] therefore , for each other chain there must occur a threshold magnetic field from which the chain begins to exist if it is realized .",
    "it seems natural to assume that the threshold magnetic field grows with the length of the chain which is defined by a number of heavy particles therein . at the moment , only those @xmath10 and @xmath8 - the shortest chains - are studied in details , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the results are far more sophisticated than those predicted in a simple qualitative picture in @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath8-molecule does _ not _ exist at a large domain of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the aim of this article is to perform a detailed quantitative study of hydrogen , helium and also mixed , helium - hydrogen linear chains with one or two electrons making an emphasis of the domain of magnetic fields @xmath11  g ) .",
    "it is shown that in the one electron case depending on the magnetic field strength the hydrogenic systems @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and even @xmath2 can exist in linear geometry .",
    "it is also shown that , as the magnetic field is increased , the exotic helium - hydrogenic chains @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 begin to exist in linear geometry ( see for a brief review @xcite ) . for all magnetic fields the system @xmath10 is stable when the system @xmath12 becomes stable at @xmath19 g . a detailed review of the current status of some one - electron hydrogenic molecular systems , both traditional and exotic , that might exist in a magnetic field @xmath20 g can be found in @xcite . for two - electron case depending on the magnetic field strength the hydrogenic chains @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath21 and at most @xmath3 can exist in linear geometry , as well as the two - electron helium chains @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the mixed hydrogen - helium chains @xmath25 , @xmath26,@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . since our study is limited to the question of the existence of a particular coulomb system the main attention is paid to an exploration of the ground state .",
    "overall study is made in framework of non - relativistic consideration by solving the schroedinger equation .",
    "it is also assumed that the born - oppenheimer approximation of zero order holds , which implies that the positions of positively - charged heavy particles are kept fixed ( they are assumed to be infinitely - massive ) .",
    "relativistic corrections are always neglected assuming that the longitudinal motion of electrons is non - relativistic for magnetic field @xmath33 g while there are no relativistic corrections to the energies of transverse motion since the spectra of non - relativistic and relativistic harmonic oscillators coincide ( we call it ` the duncan argument ' , for a discussion see @xcite ) . some preliminary results were announced in @xcite .",
    "atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath34=@xmath35=@xmath36=1 ) , although energies are expressed in rydbergs ( ry ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath37 is given in a.u . with a conversion factor @xmath38 g .",
    "let us consider the electron and @xmath39 infinitely - massive particles ( protons ) situated on a line which coincides to the magnetic line ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we call this system a linear finite chain of the size @xmath39 .",
    "if for such a system a bound state can be found it implies the existence of the ion @xmath40 in linear geometry .",
    "@xmath41 linear molecular ion in parallel configuration with a magnetic field @xmath42 oriented along the @xmath43-axis.,width=307 ]    the hamiltonian which describes this system when the magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath43 direction , @xmath44 is @xmath45 ( see fig .  [ figure1 ] for the geometrical setting and notations ) , where @xmath46 in the case of protons , @xmath47 is the momentum of the electron and @xmath48 is the operator of the spin , @xmath49 is the distance from the electron to the @xmath50th proton and @xmath51 is the distance between the @xmath50th and @xmath52th protons .",
    "@xmath53 is a vector potential which corresponds to the constant uniform magnetic field @xmath54 .",
    "it is chosen to be in the symmetric gauge , @xmath55 finally , the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the z - components of the total angular momentum and total spin operators , respectively , and @xmath59 . both @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "are integrals of motion .",
    "thus , the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 in ( [ h1e - final ] ) can be replaced by their eigenvalues @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "since we are interested by the ground state for which @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the last term in ( [ h1e - final ] ) can be omitted and the reference point for energy becomes @xmath64 .    in the equilibrium configuration",
    "the problem is characterized by two integrals of motion : ( i ) angular momentum projection @xmath60 on the magnetic field direction ( @xmath43-direction ) and ( ii ) spatial parity @xmath65 . the problem for parallel symmetric configuration is characterized by the @xmath43-parity , @xmath66 with eigenvalues @xmath67 .",
    "one can relate the magnetic quantum number @xmath60 , spatial parity @xmath65 and @xmath43-parity @xmath68 , @xmath69 in the case @xmath60 is even , both parities coincide , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , any eigenstate has two definite quantum numbers : the magnetic quantum number @xmath60 and the parity @xmath65 with respect @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the space of eigenstates is split into subspaces ( sectors ) each of them is characterized by definite @xmath60 and @xmath68 , or @xmath60 and @xmath65 .",
    "notation for the states is based on the following convention : the first number corresponds to the number of excitation - `` principal quantum number '' , e.g. the number 1 is assigned to the ground state , then a greek letter @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 , respectively , with subscript @xmath74 ( gerade / ungerade ) corresponding positive / negative eigenvalues of spacial parity operator @xmath75 .",
    "the variational method is used for a study of the hamiltonian ( [ h1e - final ] ) .",
    "trial functions are chosen following the physics relevance arguments @xcite .",
    "their explicit expression is a linear superposition of @xmath76 terms given by @xmath77 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are linear and non - linear parameters , respectively .",
    "interproton distances @xmath80 are considered as variational parameters as well .",
    "notation @xmath81 means the symmetrization of identical nuclei of the expression inside the brackets .",
    "usually , to each term in ( [ 1e - psi ] ) a certain physical meaning is given .",
    "for example , one term had all @xmath82 at @xmath83 equal being an analogue of the heitler - london wavefunction for the @xmath10-ion - describing the coherent interaction of the electron with all protons .",
    "for another term all @xmath82 , except for one , vanish being an analogue of the hund - mulliken wavefunction - describing the incoherent interaction of the electron with all protons .",
    "all other terms are different non - linear superposition of these two being an analogue of guillemin - zener wavefunction for the @xmath10-ion .",
    "we call a term for which all @xmath82 are different and unconstrained , the _",
    "general term_. needless to mention that in each particular term in ( [ 1e - psi ] ) the parameters are chosen in such a way to assure normalizability of this term as the overall function .",
    "calculations are performed using the minimization package minuit from cern - lib .",
    "two - dimensional integration is carried out using a dynamical partitioning procedure : a domain of integration is manually divided into subdomains following an integrand profile with a localization of domains of large gradients of the integrand .",
    "each subdomain is integrated ( for details , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical integration of subdomains is done with a relative accuracy of @xmath84 by use of the adaptive d01fcf routine from nag - lib .",
    "this case was considered for the sake of completeness .",
    "it is known that the hydrogen atom exists for any magnetic field strength .",
    "it is the least bound system among one - electron systems .",
    "the results for @xmath85-atom at @xmath86a.u . are calculated with a ten - parametric variational trial function which is a modification of the function introduced in @xcite .",
    "it will be described elsewhere .",
    "the results for @xmath10-ion are found with 3-term trial function ( [ 1e - psi ] ) which depends on the 10 free parameters including the interproton distance @xmath80 , it is a linear superposition of the heitler - london , hund - mulliken and guillemin - zener ( general term ) wavefunctions . for @xmath87 a.u .",
    "results are from @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath88-ion are found with a 3-term trial function ( [ 1e - psi ] ) which depends on 22 free parameters including two interproton distances @xmath80 s , it is a linear superposition of the heitler - london , hund - mulliken and a type of the guillemin - zener ( general term ) wavefunctions . for @xmath87 a.u .",
    "results are from @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath89-ion are found with 1-term trial function ( [ 1e - psi ] ) which depends on the 7 free parameters including three interproton distances @xmath80 s two of them are assumed to be equal ( symmetric configuration ) .",
    "for @xmath90 a.u .",
    "the results obtained with 3- and 7-term trial function ( [ 1e - psi ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "they lead to slightly better binding energies but do not change the qualitative picture .",
    "it is the first study of this system .",
    "the results for the @xmath91-ion are obtained using a 2-term trial function ( [ 1e - psi ] ) which depends on the 15 free parameters including four interproton distances @xmath80 s , two pairs of them are assumed to be equal ( symmetric configuration ) .",
    "in fact , it implies that a linear superposition of two general terms is taken .",
    "it is worth noting that already 1-term trial function at @xmath92a.u .",
    "gives a clear indication to the existence of the @xmath91-ion with binding energy @xmath93ry and equilibrium distances @xmath94a.u .",
    "the smallest magnetic field for which a minimum of the total energy surface in @xmath80 s was observed is @xmath95a.u .",
    "the @xmath91-ion for these magnetic fields looks like @xmath88-ion bound with a far - distant proton from each side .",
    "no indication to the existence of the @xmath96-ion in the domain @xmath97a.u . is found .",

    "for all studied magnetic fields the systems @xmath98 and @xmath10 are stable : the @xmath98-atom has no decay channels , where the total energy of the @xmath10-ion is always less than the total energy of the @xmath98-atom .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath103a.u .",

    "the @xmath12-ion never dissociates to @xmath104 but it always dissociates to @xmath105 . for higher magnetic fields @xmath106a.u . the @xmath12-ion becomes stable as well .",

    "the system @xmath13 can dissociate to @xmath12 , although the energy difference between such systems decreases gradually as the magnetic field increases .",

    "summarizing , one can state that there are two one - electron finite hydrogenic chains characterized by lowest total energy for different magnetic fields : it is the @xmath10-system at @xmath112a.u . and the @xmath12-ion at @xmath113a.u .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",

    "several more new exotic ions appear quickly forming linear chains",
    ". then similar appearance of new exotic ions happens at @xmath136a.u .",
    "it is quite interesting that the ions which already appeared ( existed ) below some magnetic field threshold , above of the threshold they become stable .",
    "it is worth noting that for fixed magnetic field the neutral systems are always the least bound ones .",
    "concluding we present a list of 1 - 2@xmath36 proton-@xmath137particle contained ions for which a certain magnetic fields exist where they are stable , @xmath138 @xmath139 among the 25 coulomb 1 - 2@xmath36 systems which ( can ) exist in a magnetic field ( see tables i - ix ) .",

    "it encourages us to an exploration of finite mass effects in a magnetic field .",
    "this issue looks quite complicated technically due to absence of a separation of variables , especially , in the case of more than two particles and non - zero total charge of the system .",
    "those two cases are exactly ones which are the most important from the point of view of obtained results : the most bound systems contain usually more than two bodies and charged .",
    "another important issue is related to relativistic corrections to our non - relativistic results .",
    "although in our understanding the duncan qualitative argument @xcite sounds physically , it needs to be checked quantitatively .",
