    "the most interesting feature in the broad - band high - energy spectrum of pks  @xmath1 is the spectral flattening below @xmath12  kev .",
    "such a flattening has been observed also by de rosa et al .",

    "this low - energy photon deficit can be best fit with a power - law harder ( @xmath102 ) than the one at energies greater than @xmath12  kev ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this low - energy photon deficit has been often observed in high - redshift flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fiore et al .",
    "1998 ; worsley et al . 2004 ) .",
    "according to fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the photoelectric absorption intrinsic to the quasar is likely to be the origin of these low - energy roll - off . however , in the case of pks @xmath1 , the tests performed to fit with a ionized absorber the low - energy data gave worst results ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) . the broken power - law is statistically required and this suggests that the spectral break is likely to be due to the intrinsic curvature of the spectrum near the low - energy end of the external - compton ( ec ) component , while the relative importance of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) component is likely to decrease due to the increasing importance of the external ( broad - line region , accretion disk , other ) radiation field ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2007 ; ghisellini et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , in the case of pks  @xmath1 , the gravitational lensing should have an impact on the spectral and variability properties of the source , but it is not clear how to weight it at high - energy .",
    "these effects in the @xmath0-ray band on distant blazars have been discussed by combi & romero ( 1998 ) and torres et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the observed hard x - rays and , probably the soft x - rays as well , are the combination of the contributions from ssc and ec , which in turn are generated from different places .",
    "therefore , the lensing can act differently , resulting in changes in spectral shape .",
    "we can also probe further on the possible intrinsic spectrum and the amplification factor corresponding to different part of the energy spectrum of pks  @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that , apart from the absorptions in table  [ tab : spec - fit ] due to the galactic column and the intervening system , the spectral break and roll - off in spectrum at low energies is caused by the difference in amplification factor .",
    "therefore , we take as the intrinsic spectrum of pks  @xmath1 the power law with @xmath7 from @xmath103 to @xmath104  kev .",
    "we extend this value to low energies , calculate the flux in the @xmath105  kev energy band and compare to the observed one .",
    "the ratio of the amplification factor at energies between below and above @xmath106  kev is estimated by the value around @xmath107 .",
    "this value appears to be too low , as it is expected that the amplification factor increases with the energy and , so far , the available modelings of the magnification factor from radio / optical observations is in the range @xmath108 ( nair et al . 1993 , swift et al . 2001 , courbin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the time variability analysis could offer another way to try estimating the impact of the gravitational lensing .",
    "pks  @xmath1 is known to be radio variable on time scales of months ( steppe et al . 1993 ) .",
    "other estimations of time scales are of @xmath109 days ( van ommen et al .",
    "1995 ) or @xmath110 days ( lovell et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in modelling pks  @xmath1 by subrahmanyan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the time lag between the two main components ( ne and sw ) is expressed as @xmath111  days , where @xmath112 is the redshift of the lensing galaxy , @xmath113 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath114  km  s@xmath35  mpc@xmath35 . by setting the lensing galaxy at @xmath16 , and @xmath115  km  s@xmath35  mpc@xmath35 , we have the time lag of the order of @xmath116  days .",
    "therefore , the time lag between the two core components might be in the range @xmath117 days .",
    "the hard x - ray variability displayed in the lightcurves of _ integral_/isgri in the @xmath3  kev band and of _ swift_/bat in the @xmath68  kev band is quite beyond this range .",
    "the source flux can vary by a factor of @xmath70 on time scales of months to year and the relatively poor statistics prevent us from establishing convincing evidences of the flux variability on shorter time scales .",
    "the observed variability might be the result of the evolutions either of the relativistic jet plasma or the inverse - compton - scattered soft target photons .",
    "it might be that , by given a steady jet plasma , the soft target photons have the density evolving over months to year , which cause the long term variability showing up at hard x - rays .",
    "de rosa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reproduced the sed of pks 1830 - 211 with a ssc+ec model , where the ec component was dominated by photon field from the torus .",
    "this scenario could fit with the observed hard - x ray variability on a year time scale , when this variability is attributed to the evolution of the soft photons target density .",
    "however , we point out that the sed built by de rosa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) has been corrected at high - energy by the amplification factor due to the gravitational lensing , which in turn is affected by large uncertainties , as we have already underlined .",
    "one of the main result of the amplification is to change the luminosity of the seed photon source and , therefore , the conclusions by de rosa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) could be severely biased by the not fully justified assumption of the amplification factor correction .",
    "a possible measurement of a time lag at hard x - rays in the future may help to resolve the contribution , if any , of the core region to the jet dominated emission .",
    "an indication might be that , as already pointed out in de rosa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , pks  @xmath1 is actually another blazar to have persistent mev emissions , which are always detectable by comptel .",
    "the other two comptel blazars which own mev emission be visible over years are 3c  @xmath118 ( collmar et al .",
    "2000 ) and 3c  @xmath119 ( zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "such a long - term steady mev emission has been discussed in zhang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for 3c  @xmath120 , in the framework of leptonic multicomponent models where the mev emission might be dominated by ec of seed photons coming directly from the accretion disk .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is argued to keep at a relatively high level to maintain the mev emission visible over the time scale of years . in the case of pks",
    "@xmath1 , such a bulk lorentz factor has been estimated to be about @xmath121 by foschini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where  given the uncertainties of the lensing at high - energies  the modelling of the sed was performed on the observed data , without any correction .    in summary",
    ", we presented here the most updated broad - band high - energy spectrum of pks  @xmath1 .",
    "the source presents a low - energy roll - off that can be explained efficiently in term of natural interplay between ssc and ec , as shown in other high - z fsrq .",
    "however , it is not clear what is the weight of the amplification factor due to the gravitational lensing .",
