    "the bilayer fluid membranes , which can form spontaneously when molecules with hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts are introduced to water , are a popular topic of research . in theoretical studies of such membranes , it is usual to work on length scales much larger than the molecular size , so that they can be considered as continuous surfaces ; two - dimensional curved spaces embedded in euclidean three - space .",
    "features commonly incorporated into mathematical models of membranes include bending rigidity @xmath0 ( disaffinity for extrinsic curvature ) , gaussian curvature modulus @xmath1 ( disaffinity for intrinsic curvature ) , spontaneous curvature due to membrane asymmetries , and for closed surfaces , constraints of constant volume , constant area and constant difference in area between the inner and outer layers . in recent years",
    ", interest has grown in membranes whose molecules have orientational order within the surface .",
    "for instance , a smectic - a liquid crystal membrane , whose molecules have aliphatic tails which point in an average direction normal to the local tangent plane of the membrane , can undergo a continuous phase transition to smectic - c phase , in which the tails tilt .",
    "the tilt is described by a two - component vector order parameter within the surface , given by the local thermal average of vectors parallel to the tails , projected onto to local tangent plane .",
    "if such a membrane has intrinsic ( gaussian ) curvature , its orientational order is frustrated , since a parallel vector field can not exist in a curved space .",
    "ordering is further frustrated on a closed surface of spherical topology ( genus zero ) , as an intrinsic vector field must have topological defects whose indices sum to the euler number of the surface ; in this case , two .",
    "_ there must be at least two vortices in the order parameter field on a sphere .",
    "the order parameter field vanishes at these defects to avoid infinite gradients .",
    "the defects are energetically costly but topologically unavoidable .",
    "the energetics of a smectic - c , genus zero membrane were studied by mackintosh and lubensky in @xcite .",
    "there are other types of orientational order .",
    "nematic order is similar to vector order except that its order parameter is locally invariant under rotations through @xmath2 .",
    "hence nematics can form defects of index @xmath3 .",
    "hexatic order is locally invariant under rotations through @xmath4 , as this is the molecular ` bond ' angle .",
    "the notion may be generalized to fluid phases with @xmath5-atic orientational order being locally invariant under rotations through @xmath6 and forming defects of index @xmath7 .",
    "if a vector ( ` monatic ' ) is represented by an arrow then we may picture an @xmath5-atic as an @xmath5-headed arrow or an @xmath5-spoked wheel . for a theoretical study of @xmath5-atic fluid membranes of genus zero ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "theoretical findings on @xmath5-atic fluid membranes of toroidal topology are presented .",
    "as the torus has genus one and euler number zero , it is possible to arrange an intrinsic vector field on a torus without topological defects .",
    "_ furry tori can be brushed smooth . )",
    "therefore it appears plausible that @xmath5-atic membranes with large order parameter coupling compared with bending rigidity may energetically favour a toroidal topology to a spherical one .",
    "the object of embarking on this research was to confirm or refute this hypothesis .",
    "as will be demonstrated , it turns out to be true , although the arrangements of ordering in the toroidal surface are far more diverse than expected .    throughout this paper ,",
    "a number of approximations are used .",
    "one approximation is the use of mean field theory .",
    "that is , no thermal fluctuations are considered .",
    "so the configuration adopted by the system is assumed to be that which minimizes its free energy .",
    "also , the lowest landau level approximation is employed in constructing the order parameter field , as discussed in section [ landau ] .",
    "the validity of these approximations is investigated in section [ validity ] .",
    "both of these approximations give rise to apparent phase transitions between separate , clearly defined states of the system , some of which may in fact be blurred by thermal fluctuations and higher landau levels , to the point where they disappear .",
    "it should therefore be understood that , where reference is made to phase transitions , it is in the context of mean field theory and the lowest landau level approximation . before studying the thermal physics",
    ", it will be necessary to introduce some tensor calculus .",
    "this is needed to describe the behaviour of an @xmath5-atic field living within a two - dimensional curved space , as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic elastic properties of the space ( _ ie .  _",
    "the membrane ) itself . in the absence of intrinsic",
    "ordering ( _ ie .",
    "_ under the influence of the membrane s elasticity alone ) , one might expect the equilibrium shape of a toroidal vesicle to be axisymmetric .",
    "however , such a vesicle is only neutrally stable with respect to one particular mode of non - axisymmetric deformation .",
    "this goldstone mode is discussed in section [ goldstone ] , in which a further approximation is introduced , limiting the range of vesicle shapes to be explored . in the sections that follow ,",
    "the ground - state configurations and energies of the order parameter field are calculated for each of these shapes , subject to the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "although some of these shapes are never energetically favoured , the behaviour of the field living on them is of interest , if only academic .",
    "finally , in section [ pd ] , the total free energy ( consisting of order - parameter field and membrane elasticity parts ) is minimized with respect to vesicle shape , to find the equilibrium configuration of the system as a function of temperature and the other thermodynamic parameters .",
    "the result is a set of phase diagrams for various values of @xmath5 , which contain phases of vesicles with different shapes and ordering .",
    "the shapes should be experimentally observable , although the intrinsic ordering is most likely not .",
    "@xmath5 is the order of rotational symmetry .",
    "as stated earlier , the fluid membrane is locally invariant under rotations through @xmath6 , and the @xmath5-atic field may be represented by a set of @xmath5-spoked wheels tessellating .",
    "clearly @xmath5 is integer .",
    "furthermore , it must be one of the set of numbers for which regular @xmath5-gons tessellate .",
    "that is , @xmath8 .",
    "these are the values of @xmath5 which park et .",
    "al .  studied in @xcite .",
    "however , consider a triangular ( @xmath9 ) lattice with long - range _ orientational _ , but no _ positional _ order ; the @xmath9 analogue of a hexatic lattice .",
    "bonds between neighbouring molecules lie at angles which are integer multiples of @xmath10 .",
    "its symmetry properties in the absence of positional order are therefore indistinguishable from its dual lattice , the hexatic , and it will form defects of index @xmath11 , in preference to the more energetically expensive index @xmath12 defects . to convince oneself of this , it might be helpful to attempt to draw a lattice which has @xmath13 rotational symmetry , but does not have @xmath4 rotational symmetry .",
    "this is only possible if one keeps strict account of the positions of the lattice sites and polygons ( _ ie .",
    "_ in the absence of dislocations ) .",
    "the following research is therefore conducted for @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 curved surface is embedded in euclidean @xmath16-space .",
    "if @xmath17 is a two - dimensional coordinate of a point @xmath18 on the surface then @xmath19 is the position vector of @xmath18 in the embedding space relative to some origin .",
    "coordinate - dependent unit basis vectors @xmath20 , where @xmath21 takes the values @xmath22 and @xmath23 to label the coordinates , are defined in the directions of @xmath24 .",
    "a coordinate - invariant metric tensor is defined on the riemannian @xmath23-space , with components , from which the area of the closed surface is calculated : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "indices are raised and lowered by the metric and its inverse , @xmath27 , in the standard manner .",
    "the extrinsic curvature tensor has components @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a unit vector normal to the surface .",
    "dot products are evaluated in @xmath30 . )",
    "its trace , @xmath31 , is the ` total curvature ' .",
    "readers may be familiar with the _ mean _ curvature which is half of this quantity .",
    "the intrinsic or gaussian curvature is given by @xmath32 .",
    "as an example , the above quantities are calculated for a sphere of radius @xmath33 , using spherical polar coordinates @xmath34 .",
    "the metric tensor may be represented by a matrix : @xmath35 with determinant @xmath36 .",
    "hence the area element for integration is @xmath37 , which is just the jacobian for spherical polars .",
    "any continuous , doubly differentiable surface has two principal radii of curvature , @xmath38 and @xmath39 at each point .",
    "these are the radii of curvature of the geodesics passing through that point which have respectively the greatest and least curvature as measured in the euclidean embedding space .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that these two geodesics are always perpendicular .",
    "if the particular coordinate basis used corresponds to these two perpendicular directions , then the curvature tensor will be diagonal , and given by @xmath40 of course , on a sphere , curvature is constant .",
    "therefore @xmath41 where the sign convention denotes the direction of the normal .",
    "however , it should be noted that , without one index raised , the components are not constant : @xmath42 clearly , on a sphere , mean curvature is @xmath43 and gaussian curvature is @xmath44 .",
    "recall that the intrinsic @xmath5-atic order in the system is orientational , not positional , and that it is locally invariant under rotations through @xmath6 . as",
    "this orientational order is intrinsic to a 2-dimensional space , in can be represented by a complex order parameter in the following way .",
    "let @xmath45 be the local angle between @xmath46 and the orientation of ordering . for vector order , this orientation is easily defined .",
    "for instance , in a smectic - c membrane , it is the direction of a molecule s aliphatic tail projected onto the local tangent plane of the membrane .",
    "however , in a nematic liquid crystal , @xmath45 may take one of two values for each molecule , depending on which end of the molecule one chooses to measure from . for our purposes",
    ", it does not matter which of these two values is assigned to @xmath45 at each point . for bond - angle",
    "orientational order , _ eg .  _",
    "hexatic , there is an @xmath5-fold ambiguity in the definition of @xmath45 but again , it does not matter which of the @xmath5 orientations is chosen .",
    "it is conventional in this case to define @xmath45 at a given molecule as the angle between the basis vector @xmath46 and the line joining that molecule to its nearest neighbour .",
    "having defined @xmath45 , the order parameter is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes a thermal average .",
    "note that @xmath49 has the appropriate rotational invariance , since a rotation of the orientation of ordering through an angle @xmath50 within the surface is represented by a rotation of @xmath49 through @xmath51 in the argand plane . hence rotating the orientation of ordering through @xmath6 corresponds an identity transformation in the complex plane .",
    "the model used is identical to that in @xcite .",
    "there is zero spontaneous curvature as the bilayers considered are symmetric , and no constraint on bilayer area difference .",
    "the vesicle s volume is also unconstrained since small solvent molecules may diffuse freely in and out , so long as the solvent is very pure ; containing no free ions , which would lead to osmotic pressure .",
    "the membrane s area @xmath52 is fixed by the number of constituent molecules .",
    "the free energy functional @xmath53/t = \\int d^2    \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}\\sqrt{g}\\ ,    \\left ( \\,r|\\psi |^2 + \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$}u|\\psi |^4    + cd^{a}\\psi d^{*}_{a}\\psi ^ *    + \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$}\\kappa ( k^{a}_{a})^2 + \\kappa_{g } k \\,\\right)\\ ] ] closely resembles the ginzburg - landau free energy for classical superconductors . for a discussion of how the thermodynamic coefficients relate to real physical and chemical quantities ,",
    "see for instance @xcite . as defined in eq.([psi ] ) , the phase of @xmath49 depends on the choice of basis vectors . hence the derivatives @xmath54 in eq.([f ] ) must be covariant in order for the quantity @xmath55 to be physical . let the basis vectors be rotated through an angle @xmath56 . consequently , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the components of the rotation matrix .",
    "given that @xmath59 , demanding that @xmath55 is invariant under the gauge transformation implies that the components of @xmath60 transform like @xmath61 so @xmath60 undergoes the usual transformation , @xmath62 , of a vector potential in a gauge - invariant derivative .",
    "but , in addition there is a coordinate rotation , @xmath63 since , in this complex number representation , a rotation of the argand plane is always accompanied by a rotation of the basis vectors .",
    "the ` spin connection ' , @xmath64 has the appropriate transformation . on the sphere , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "above the continuous transition to the disordered phase , @xmath49 vanishes and only the last two terms in the free energy eq.([f ] ) survive .",
    "these constitute the helfrich hamiltonian , describing the elastic energy of a constant area membrane .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ curvature energy , being proportional to the integral of gaussian curvature , is a _ topological _ invariant , according to the gauss - bonnet formula @xmath67 where @xmath50 is the euler number of the closed surface @xcite . for an orientable surface , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the surface s genus ; _ ie .  _",
    "how many ` handles ' it has .",
    "hence the intrinsic curvature energy is zero for a torus and @xmath70 for a sphere .",
    "the _ total _ curvature energy , @xmath71 , is a _ conformal _",
    "invariant @xcite .",
    "_ ie .  _ it is invariant under shape changes of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant vector which parameterizes the conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "a sphere has total curvature energy @xmath74 and its shape is not changed by such a transformation .",
    "this is not true for tori .",
    "an axisymmetric , circular cross section torus may be deformed by a conformal transformation . as a consequence of the circular cross - section , a component of @xmath73 parallel to the symmetry axis serves only to change the torus s size .",
    "hence there remains only a one - parameter family of non - trivial conformal transformations . with @xmath73 lying in the symmetry plane ,",
    "the surface is deformed into a non - axisymmetric torus such as the one in fig.([piccy ] ) , and as @xmath73 increases in magnitude , the asymmetry increases until , in the limit , the torus becomes a perfect sphere with an infinitesimal handle .",
    "the handle , although infinitesimal , must contain an intrinsic curvature energy of @xmath75 and finite total curvature energy . a circular",
    ", axisymmetric torus of aspect ratio ( ratio of radii of generating has total curvature energy @xmath76 which is a minimum at @xmath77 , the clifford torus , and infinite at @xmath78 , where the torus becomes self - intersecting .",
    "willmore conjectured @xcite that clifford s torus and its conformal transformations have the _ absolute _ minimum curvature energy of any surface of toroidal topology ; a conjecture that is difficult to prove , as the most general toroidal surface can not easily be parameterized : tori can even be knotted .",
    "accordingly , this paper will not explore the whole of phase space .",
    "the discussion will be restricted to axisymmetric , circular cross - section tori and their conformal transformations , with the assumption that these are close to the ground state shapes . to be consistent ,",
    "the ground - state genus - zero shape is approximated by a sphere : the deviations from sphericity calculated in @xcite are not included .",
    "the field gradient energy term in eq.([f ] ) may be re - formulated . using integration by parts ,",
    "it is simple to show that , on a closed surface , @xmath79 let @xmath80 be eigenfunctions satisfying the hermitian equation @xmath81 and the orthonormalization condition @xmath82 these are the landau levels .",
    "@xmath49 may be expanded in this complete set of functions .",
    "however , close to the mean - field transition , it is a good approximation to use only the landau levels with the lowest eigenvalue , @xmath83 . as is common in such problems , there is a degenerate set of lowest landau levels .",
    "@xmath84 scales inversely with area .",
    "so let us define a scale - invariant eigenvalue @xmath85 , by @xmath86    the free energy becomes @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are complex constants .",
    "note that the mean field transition has been lowered from @xmath90 to @xmath91 where @xmath92 . on an intrinsically flat surface , @xmath93 but it is finite and positive - definite on a surface with finite gaussian curvature .",
    "so ordering is frustrated by intrinsic curvature .",
    "eq.([eigen ] ) may be re - written as the differential equation @xmath94 \\partial_{a } \\partial_{b } \\phi_{p }    + \\left[(\\frac{\\partial_{b}-2ina_{b}}{\\sqrt{g}})(\\sqrt{g}\\,g^{ab})\\right ]    \\partial_{a } \\phi_{p }    + \\left [ \\frac{-ind_{a}}{\\sqrt{g}}(\\sqrt{g}\\,g^{ab}a_{b } ) \\right ] \\psi_{p }    = -\\frac{4\\pi}{\\cal a } \\lambda \\phi_{p } .\\ ] ] this is still general to any surface .      on a sphere , in spherical polar",
    "coordinates @xmath34 , eq.([eigen2 ] ) becomes @xmath95 which is solved by @xmath96 and @xmath80 of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 takes integer values from @xmath99 to @xmath5 .",
    "these functions form an alternative basis set to that used in @xcite and are linear combinations of that set .",
    "they are given in @xcite in a different gauge .",
    "the functions have @xmath100 zeros , which are topological defects of index @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath101-fold degeneracy reflects the freedom of the defects to lie anywhere on the surface at no energy cost to order @xmath102 .",
    "on tori , @xmath80 and @xmath85 depend on @xmath103 and @xmath73 .",
    "consider first the axisymmetric case ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "let us define coordinates @xmath105 .",
    "the azimuthal angle is @xmath106 , varying around the large generating circle and subtended at the centre .",
    "the angle @xmath107 varies around the smaller generating circle and is measured from the symmetry plane , as shown in fig.([coords ] ) .",
    "let the small generating circle have radius @xmath108 . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the following quantities are found : @xmath109 the landau level equation eq.([eigen2 ] ) becomes @xmath110 \\phi_{p }    = \\frac{4\\pi\\lambda}{\\cal a}\\phi_{p } , \\ ] ] which is manifestly invariant under @xmath111 with complex conjugation , reflecting the up - down mirror symmetry of the torus .",
    "note that changing variable from @xmath107 to @xmath112 and setting @xmath103 to zero re - creates the sphere equation ( eq.([eigensphere ] ) ) .",
    "eq.([eigentorus ] ) has separable variables and is solved by functions of the form @xmath113 for integer @xmath98 , where @xmath114f_{p }    = \\frac{4\\pi\\lambda}{\\cal a}f_{p}\\ ] ] and @xmath115 is real .",
    "it is immediately apparent from the form of eq.([eigentorus2 ] ) that @xmath116 and consequently @xmath80 and @xmath117 are degenerate pairs of states .",
    "the ground - state solutions of eq.([eigentorus2 ] ) were found numerically for various values of @xmath98 and @xmath103 , using rayleigh - ritz variational method .",
    "trial functions were synthesized from a truncated fourier series , @xmath118 which has the appropriate periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the fourier coefficients were used as variational parameters to minimize the integral @xmath119    f_{p}^{\\mbox{\\tiny trial}}\\:d\\eta\\ ] ] subject to eq.([normalization ] ) .",
    "the minimal value of eq.([variationalfunctional ] ) is an upper bound on @xmath120 , and the corresponding function @xmath121 is approximately @xmath115 .",
    "using a fourier series truncated after frequency @xmath122 creates a @xmath123-dimensional parameter space to explore in the numerical minimization .",
    "so cpu time increases very rapidly with @xmath122 .",
    "a second numerical method was also used , which involved numerically ` integrating ' eq.([eigentorus2 ] ) forward in @xmath107 from @xmath124 to @xmath125 and minimizing the resultant discontinuities in @xmath115 and its derivative , with respect to the initial conditions and @xmath85 .",
    "this method is more accurate than the rayleigh - ritz method but more difficult to use since , depending on the starting conditions , it may find a non - ground - state solution .",
    "however , it was useful in establishing the accuracy of the upper bounds .",
    "using @xmath126 , @xmath120 was found to an accuracy of 0.05% in the worst case .    in fig.([lambdagraphs ] ) , @xmath127 is plotted for @xmath128 , with data points at increments of 0.5 in @xmath103 and cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the states are labelled @xmath129 .",
    "one might have guessed that @xmath130 would be the ground state in each case . and indeed , for large aspect ratios , when the torus is almost cylinder - like , the @xmath131 states do have the lowest energy .",
    "these states are even functions of @xmath107 , being larger at @xmath132 than at @xmath133 where there is more absolute intrinsic curvature , and do not vary with @xmath106 .",
    "_ the field does not twist with respect to the coordinate lines as @xmath106 increases .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath103 , states with non - zero @xmath98 are energetically favoured .    before explaining the reason for this , it is necessary to describe these states .",
    "fig.([states ] ) depicts a selection of states for @xmath134 on a clifford torus .",
    "the nematic - order field is represented by sets of double - ended lines directed along the orientations of order in the surface of the torus .",
    "the length of each line is proportional to @xmath135 at that point .",
    "note however that the three - dimensional views of the toroidal surface cause the lines to be foreshortened at oblique angles to the line of sight .",
    "two views are shown of each field on the toroidal surface , as well as a graph of @xmath136 .",
    "note that positive @xmath98 states have a large field on the bottom of the torus and small on the top , and vice versa for negative @xmath98 .",
    "this asymmetry becomes more pronounced with increasing @xmath98 , with increasing @xmath5 , and with decreasing @xmath103 . as stated earlier , ordering is frustrated by intrinsic curvature . and",
    "the net amount of intrinsic curvature on the torus is constant .",
    "but as @xmath103 decreases , the curvature is redistributed .",
    "it becomes more negative around the hole and more positive around the outside of the torus , with the top and bottom remaining fairly flat .",
    "so this is where the field prefers to reside and be parallel .",
    "although in eq.([form ] ) non - zero @xmath98 states appear to twist with respect to the coordinate basis as @xmath106 increases , the basis itself twists on the top and bottom of the torus as the hole is circled .",
    "the two twists cancel .",
    "note that the diagram of the @xmath137 state depicts a field which is as parallel as possible on the top ` face ' of the torus .",
    "of course , the field on the inner and outer ` rims ' still contributes to the free energy so , as @xmath103 increases , the ground - state value of @xmath98 decreases by a series of ` transitions ' .",
    "this is clear in fig.([lambdagraphs ] ) .",
    "these should not be regarded as true phase transitions , since the lowest landau level approximation breaks down completely at these points . as a crossover between eigenvalues",
    "is approached , the true state is a mixture of the two states .    it should be emphasized that the tori studied here are true , curved tori , embedded in 3-space .",
    "they should not be confused with a flat torus , which is a plane with opposite edges identified , for which the above energetics would not apply .",
    "the two have the same topology , but different local geometries .",
    "when @xmath138 , the landau level equation ( eq.([eigen2 ] ) ) becomes much more complicated and its variables are no longer separable .",
    "however , rayleigh - ritz variational method is again possible , as @xmath139 but the trial wavefunctions are now complex , periodic functions of two variables .",
    "thus , synthesizing them with a truncated , two - dimensional , complex fourier series up to frequency @xmath122 produces an @xmath140-dimensional space of variational parameters to be numerically explored .",
    "hence ground - state functions of the coordinates with high frequency components can not viably be found .",
    "this is unfortunate since conformally transforming an axisymmetric torus with the coordinate system described above , leaves the coordinates very unevenly distributed over the surface , with most of the interval from @xmath141 to @xmath142 in @xmath107 and @xmath106 covering only the small ` handle ' part of the torus and only a small range covering most of the area .",
    "this problem is partly solved by a coordinate transformation @xmath143 which preserves the metric s diagonalization , where @xmath144\\tan\\frac{\\rho}{2 } & = &    [ 1-\\beta(\\alpha+1)]\\tan\\frac{\\eta}{2 } \\\\",
    "\\left[1+\\beta(\\alpha+1)\\right]\\tan\\frac{\\sigma}{2 } & = &    [ 1-\\beta(\\alpha+1)]\\tan\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although this still leaves some high frequency components in the distribution of the coordinates on the handle .",
    "using these coordinates , eq.([thing ] ) is very complicated but two special cases are already known :    * when @xmath104 , the torus is axisymmetric and @xmath120 was found by the method in section [ axisym ] .",
    "* when @xmath145 , where @xmath108 is the radius of the small generating circle , the torus becomes a sphere with an infinitesimal handle .",
    "hence @xmath96 and the ground - state function is that of a sphere with all @xmath100 zeros at the handle .",
    "unfortunately , the problem is too computer - intensive to produce any useful results for intermediate values of @xmath73 .",
    "using @xmath146 and performing the minimization in a 98-dimensional parameter space took a considerable amount of cpu time per data point . at this level , no states of intermediate @xmath73 were found to have a lower eigenvalue than the known axisymmetric or spherical states . some _ local _ minima were found but these are very likely to be artifacts of the varying reliability of the upper bound , which was high by around 10% for @xmath104 and 60% in the spherical limit .",
    "more research on this problem is planned .",
    "but for the moment , it is necessary to work with the ansatz that :    * a spherical vesicle exists when its total free energy is lower than that of an axisymmetric torus . * an axisymmetric torus exists when its total free energy is lower than that of a sphere _ and _ its field energy alone is lower than that of a sphere . * a non - axisymmetric torus exists otherwise .",
    "it was noted earlier that @xmath80 and @xmath117 are degenerate to quadratic order in @xmath49 .",
    "so , from eq.([expansion ] ) , @xmath49 is a linear combination of @xmath80 and @xmath117 , where @xmath98 has the ground - state value for the given aspect ratio",
    ". the relative proportions of the two states are determined by the @xmath147 term in eq.([f ] ) .",
    "let @xmath148 be the function which minimizes @xmath149 on a surface of area @xmath150 subject to @xmath151 , and let j be the minimal value of that integral .",
    "then eq.([f ] ) is minimized by @xmath152 in the regime of the lowest landau level approximation , where @xmath21 is real .",
    "the gauge invariance and axial symmetry of the problem allow us to choose the phases of both @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "hence @xmath155 is determined by a minimization with respect to just one parameter .    for some values of @xmath103 and @xmath98 , it is found that @xmath156 .",
    "so the ` top ' and ` bottom ' states co - exist and , although each is fairly parallel on its own side of the torus , the two do not mesh smoothly where they meet .",
    "consequently , there are @xmath157 defects each of index @xmath7 around the torus s outer ` rim ' and @xmath157 of index @xmath158 round the inside of the hole : a total of @xmath159 defects .",

    "the @xmath147 term chooses s or b on the basis of which covers the surface more uniformly .",
    "a table , giving the values of @xmath103 for all transitions between ground - state field configurations on the torus , is produced in the appendix .",

    "the free energy is a minimum when @xmath165      it was explained in section [ sphere ] that the spherical landau levels are degenerate with respect to the positions of the vortices .",

    "hence , following park et al .",
    "@xcite , the ground state configuration is taken to be that of highest symmetry .",
    "so , when @xmath166 the two zeros are antipodal .",
    "when @xmath134 , the zeros lie at the corners of a regular tetrahedron and , when @xmath167 , at the corners of an icosahedron .",
    "the values of @xmath168 were found using these configurations . for @xmath169 ,",

    "when eq.([ftor ] ) is minimized with respect to @xmath103 , some of the physical richness of the problem is lost , as many of the interesting phases and all the broken symmetry states occur on tori of aspect ratios which are not the energetic optimum . however , other interesting features arise , as will be seen in the phase diagrams in figs.([phasediags1])-([phasediags1end ] ) , which result from a phase space restricted to only axisymmetric tori , and show contours of constant @xmath103 as well as lines of first order and continuous phase transitions .",
    "the phases are labelled with the notation introduced earlier .",
    "the diagrams are plotted in the plane of the two independent combinations of thermodynamic parameters in eq.([ftor ] ) . in each case , to the far right of the diagram is the high - temperature phase , for which @xmath174 . in this phase ,",
    "only the curvature energy is non - vanishing so the aspect ratio is @xmath175 ; the clifford torus .",

    "a vesicle with small @xmath0 is easily deformed by the @xmath177-state ordering to large aspect ratios at low temperatures . at large aspect ratios , @xmath176 is close to zero . as the temperature rises , @xmath49 diminishes , and can no longer hold the aspect ratio so far from the clifford torus . as the aspect ratio falls",
    ", ordering becomes more difficult .",
    "there comes a temperature at which the torus jumps down a first order phase transition to the clifford torus , where @xmath178 . at higher values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the transition is continuous .",
    "the @xmath166 phase diagram has a tri - critical point at @xmath179 and @xmath180 . for higher values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the first order transition persists for all values of @xmath0 , and meets the continuous transition at a multi - critical point .",
    "the continuous transition here is between the high - temperature phase and the @xmath181 phase , for which @xmath182 since the gradients in fig.([lambdagraphs ] ) are positive close to the clifford torus .",
    "the free energy ( eq.([f ] ) ) has now been minimized with respect to the order parameter field s configuration and magnitude and with respect to the toroidal aspect ratio .",
    "it remains only to minimize with respect to topology , according to the prescription given in section [ non - axisym ] .",
    "figs.([phasediags2])-([phasediags2end ] ) show the resulting phase diagrams , which include spherical , and axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric toroidal phases of vesicles .",
    "no @xmath103 contours are shown in these figures .",
    "the positions of the transitions vary with @xmath183 , and transition lines are shown for various values of this quantity .",
    "figs.([phasediags2])-([phasediags2end ] ) should therefore each be regarded as several phase diagrams superimposed .",
    "the @xmath181 phases do not persist when this larger phase space is explored , except for @xmath184 , for which @xmath120 is less than the sphere value of @xmath185 , when @xmath103 is close to @xmath175 .",
    "the diagrams are each divided into shaded and unshaded regions by a heavy line . in the shaded regions ,",
    "vesicles are either spheres or non - axisymmetric tori while , in unshaded regions , either spheres or axisymmetric tori occur .",
    "consider first the @xmath166 , @xmath134 and @xmath169 phase diagrams .",
    "a transition line , whose position depends on @xmath186 separates tori from spheres .",
    "note that for @xmath187 , the transition line is closed , with spheres on the inside and tori of one sort or another on the outside , while for @xmath188 , the line is open , with spheres on the high - temperature side and axisymmetric tori on the low - temperature side .",
    "this magical value of @xmath189 is the critical value of @xmath186 at which spheres would become tori if the model described curvature energy alone and did not include terms in @xmath49 .",
    "note that in these three phase diagrams the separatrix ( the @xmath190 transition ) has a vertical limb at the value of @xmath191 at which ordering first forms on the sphere , _ ie .  _",
    "at @xmath192 .    the @xmath167 diagram in fig.([phasediags2end ] )",
    "is a little more complicated since there are two distinct phases of ordering on axisymmetric tori .",
    "again , the diagram is divided into shaded and unshaded regions .",
    "the shaded region is now split into two parts .",
    "the part on the right contains spheres if @xmath188 , and non - axisymmetric tori otherwise .",
    "the part on the left contains spheres on the high @xmath193 side of the transition line ( whose position depends , of course , on @xmath186 ) and non - axisymmetric tori on the other side .",
    "the un - shaded region , which contains axisymmetric tori and spheres , is also divided into two parts .",
    "the part in the top left of the diagram behaves as described above for the other phase diagrams .",
    "the other part may ( depending on @xmath186 ) contain a closed transition line , which , unlike the other closed transition lines we have met , has spheres on the outside and axisymmetric tori , of small aspect ratio and @xmath194 field configuration , on the inside .",
    "the four phase diagram of figs.([phasediags2])-([phasediags2end ] ) may seem complicated but they are easily understood if one remembers that : _ a ) _ they are several diagrams superimposed , and _",
    "b ) _ the regions in which spherical vesicles exist become smaller as @xmath1 increases , since spheres have more intrinsic curvature than tori . having established from these diagrams that an axisymmetric torus exists in a certain region , its aspect ratio may be found from figs.([phasediags1])-([phasediags1end ] ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the curves defining the edges of the shaded regions in figs.([phasediags2])-([phasediags2end ] ) have been slightly smoothed by hand to remove pixcellation which arose from numerical rounding errors .",
    "some order - of - magnitude calculations are now presented to give an indication of the regimes of validity of the various approximations used .",
    "the landau levels form a complete set of orthogonal functions in which to expand the order parameter ; @xmath195 .",
    "each eigenfunction @xmath80 has an eigenvalue @xmath196 defined by eqs.([eigen ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "the lowest landau levels alone may be used if @xmath197 where @xmath198 . as an indicator of the region",
    "in which this is valid , let us calculate @xmath199 for gaussian fluctuations above the continuous transition , using the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the partition function is @xmath203 hence @xmath204 so for the lowest landau levels , @xmath205 and for the next lowest level , @xmath206 .",
    "hence the ratio of correlators is @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the x - coordinate in the phase diagrams , measured with respect to the transition .",
    "we see that @xmath209 is small , and hence the lowest landau level approximation is good , when @xmath210 , the right hand side of which may be estimated from fig.([lambdagraphs ] ) . for the clifford torus , @xmath211 so the approximation is quantitatively accurate only within @xmath2123 of the transition , along the x - axis .",
    "however , figs.([phasediags1])-([phasediags2end ] ) cover a much larger region than this , in order to clarify the qualitative features of the diagrams , for which the calculation at this level of approximation is a useful guide .",
    "it should be noted that , at ` transitions ' from one lowest landau level configuration to another , @xmath213 , so the approximation must break down here , as noted in section [ axisym ] . also , in the large-@xmath103 phases below the first - order transitions , @xmath176 is higher , so the system is far from the lowest landau level regime .",
    "these phases are included in the diagrams in order to show the first - order transitions .      for this order - of - magnitude analysis ,",
    "let us treat two parts of the free energy separately : first we will demand that fluctuations in the helfrich hamiltonian may be neglected in the absence of orientational order , then , within this fixed , non - fluctuating environment , it will be required that the terms in @xmath49 satisfy the ginzburg criterion for the validity of mean - field theory .    in a simplistic calculation ,",
    "good over only a short range , the monge gauge is used to parameterize a locally horizontal surface , defining its z - coordinate as a function of x and y. keeping terms of second order in z , and expanding z in plane - wave modes : @xmath214 gives @xmath215 note that the gaussian curvature energy does not influence fluctuations as it is a topological invariant . hence @xmath216 so , for fluctuations to be negligible on the scale of the system size requires @xmath217 .",
    "this is intuitively obvious ; that a large bending rigidity is required to combat fluctuations .",
    "in fact , this simple calculation on a flatish surface is over - stringent , since intrinsic curvature , as exists in closed surfaces , reduces the size of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the ginzburg criterion is now computed for the ginzburg - landau part of the free energy .",
    "this is a comparison between the size of the discontinuity in specific heat at the phase transition , calculated with mean - field theory , and the size of the divergence in specific heat due to gaussian fluctuations .",
    "close to the transition , @xmath218 goes approximately linearly with temperature @xmath219 .",
    "hence @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the shifted mean - field transition temperature , and @xmath222 is some constant . from eq.([fsph ] ) it follows that the mean - field discontinuity in specific heat is @xmath223 for simplicity , the specific heat of fluctuations is calculated for the sphere , above the phase transition .",
    "using the quadratic form eq.([quadratic ] ) , and only the @xmath101 lowest landau levels , gives a free energy density @xmath224 .",
    "hence the singular part or the specific heat is @xmath225 giving a critical exponent @xmath226 since we are in a zero dimensional @xmath227-space .",
    "the ratio of these two specific heats is @xmath228 where @xmath229 and mean field theory is good for @xmath230 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to demanding that tree graphs dominate over one - loop graphs . )",
    "so the threshold , in the phase diagrams , between the mean - field regime and the fluctuation - dominated regime is given by the curve @xmath231 , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 , having set @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "at a height @xmath236 , this region has width @xmath237",
    ". this should be much smaller than the region of interest _ ie .  _",
    "that in which the lowest landau level approximation is valid .",
    "so @xmath238 and , by inspection , in all the phase diagrams , we are interested in @xmath239 . consequently the condition for a mean - field treatment of the order parameter to be valid in this investigation is just @xmath240 , which is always consistent with the validity of a mean - field treatment of the membrane shape , calculated above .",
    "the ginzburg - landau free energy functional is and expansion in @xmath49 , truncated at order @xmath147 .",
    "this is valid when @xmath241 . in the mean - field regime",
    ", this is always the case above the continuous transition . below the transition , @xmath242 , from eq.([size ] ) .",
    "so the inequality is marginal when @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are given above .",
    "this defines a region in the phase diagrams of width @xmath246 at a height @xmath247 , which is in the region of interest .",
    "again , let s demand that @xmath248 to be consistend with the region of validity of the lowest landau level approximation . consequently",
    ", it is required that @xmath249 .",
    "dropping constants of order unity , we find that mean - field theory , the ginzburg - landau model and the lowest landau level approximation are all valid in a region of half - width @xmath250 in the phase diagrams , given that @xmath251      close to the ordering transition , @xmath49 is very small , so the order can not deform the torus far from clifford s aspect ratio @xmath175 , or the genus - zero shape far from a sphere , so the vesicle shapes used in this theoretical investigation are undoubtedly good . as park et al .",
    "discovered in @xcite , @xmath49 wants to live in a flat space , and can achieve a flattening of the membrane via the gauge - like coupling in eq.([f ] ) .",
    "this it will do where it is large , at the expense of an increased curvature where @xmath49 is small _ eg .",
    "_ at the defects",
    ". this pay - off is unavoidable , since the integral of intrinsic curvature is topologically fixed .",
    "hence spherical vesicles are slightly deformed by the in - plane order , into rounded polyhedra , whose vertices are at the order parameter s vortices .",
    "this is the effect which has been ignored in this paper .",
    "the same process will also occur in tori , especially in those parts of the phase diagrams where ordering is predicted to deform the tori to large aspect ratios .",
    "in general , one might expect that the larger the aspect ratio , the worse the approximations of circular cross - section and axisymmetry .",
    "but nature is on our side here . since , in these large - aspect - ratio tori , @xmath49 is always in the @xmath252 configuration , which has no vortices , and becomes very uniform for large aspect ratios .",
    "so , although this approximation results in some quantitative inaccuracies , they are likely to be small .",
    "also , they must change the free energy of the torus and the sphere , if not by the same amount , then at least in the same direction .",
    "so the phase diagrams may not have exactly the right numbers , but they do have more - or - less the right shape .",
    "it is clear that orientational order in a toroidal geometry is a subject rich in physical diversity , and deserving of further study in condensed matter theory .",
    "also , introducing orientational order into the surface is an interesting way of stabilizing a torus against the massless goldstone mode of conformal transformations , without resorting to spontaneous curvature or a constraint of constant volume or bilayer area difference . as far as experimental verification",
    "is concerned , the principal results of this paper are embodied in the final four phase diagrams .",
    "the approximations used in their derivation may result in quantitative inaccuracies , but the main qualitative features of these diagrams are predicted to be seen in experiment in the future . at present an experimental realization is somewhat difficult , due to the fragile nature of laboratory - produced vesicles .",
