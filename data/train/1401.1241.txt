    "nonlinear effects due to the second harmonic have also been considered @xcite , especially in the treatment of pulses .",
    "however the focus of even these studies has been on one photon absorption processes .",
    "one of the most interesting techniques for optical injection is coherent control , an example of which involves tuning the interference of one and two photon absorption processes to achieve a target response .",
    "this has been employed for injecting carriers , spin polarization , currents , and spin currents in semiconductors @xcite , and currents in graphene @xcite .",
