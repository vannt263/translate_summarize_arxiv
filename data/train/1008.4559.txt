    "physical problems that involve probabilistic outcomes range from the statistical mechanics of large ensembles of particles to the seemingly simple games of chance such as the toss of a coin and the spin of a roulette wheel .",
    "not surprisingly , in systems with many degrees of freedom , the accompanying phase space is large , and we can expect chance to play an important role in determining how the system evolves . even in systems with a few degrees of freedom , such as those associated with games of chance governed by deterministic equations of motion , the outcomes can be random due to the amplification of small variations in the initial conditions .",
    "poincar was the first to think physically about probability in his classic paper on the roulette wheel.@xcite later hopf showed that the underlying physical processes are responsible for the regularity property of probability;@xcite that is , the observed frequencies are almost constant .",
    "this advance was particularly important because it provided a physical context for the method of arbitrary functions introduced by poincae in determining probability distributions .",
    "hopf was among the first to show the role of the laws of physics in determining the flow of initial distributions to the final states in a system that can be described in terms of probability distributions , particularly when considerations of symmetry or invariance alone do not suffice.@xcite    in the context of the coin toss , the purportedly random outcome can be understood in different ways .",
    "statistically , the equal likelihood of heads and tails is suggested from an analysis of a large sequence of experiments that sample the space of outcomes .",
    "an interpretation based on symmetry suggests that because there are only two possibilities ( for a coin of zero thickness ) , both faces should have equal probabilities .",
    "this conclusion assumes that the coin can actually explore both configurations ( heads and tails ) with equal likelihood , which is not always true in a real coin toss .",
    "for example , a coin that does not flip , but precesses as it spins can end up the same way as it started . to really understand the randomness in the outcome of a coin toss",
    ", we must introduce probability into a mathematical and physical description of the process .",
    "a distribution of initial conditions evolves dynamically leading to outcomes that have effectively  forgotten \" the initial conditions either because the system parameters and/or initial conditions take on particular ranges of values and/or the system has extreme sensitivity to initial conditions ( such as in chaotic systems with one or more positive lyapunov exponents ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the simplest situation corresponding to the case for which the system has dynamical equations that are integrable and allow us to explicitly understand how a distribution of the initial conditions leads to effectively random outcomes via a dynamical flow .",
    "a first step in incorporating probability into the physics of the coin toss was done by keller,@xcite who considered the simple but illuminating case of a coin of zero thickness spinning about a horizontal axis passing through a diameter , which eventually lands without bouncing .",
    "he showed that such a coin toss becomes fair , that is , @xmath0 , in the asymptotic limit of infinite angular velocity @xmath1 and vertical velocity @xmath2 , when the phase space of any probability distribution about some nominally deterministic initial conditions @xmath3 is homogeneously and equally divided between the possible outcomes , that is , heads and tails .",
    "he showed by explicit calculation how the flow of the dynamical system with a distribution of initial conditions to the final outcome determines the probability of the outcomes .",
    "a later report included the dynamics of bouncing in the plane into this minimal model and showed how any initial probability distribution is whittled away exponentially fast.@xcite    adding a third dimension involves a number of new effects  the coin has two more rotational degrees of freedom in addition to one translational degree of freedom ( which is irrelevant ) ; the complex dynamics of bouncing because the coin can land on its edge , side , or face and thus end up neither with heads or tails ; and the finite thickness of the coin , which is more cylinder - like .",
    "diaconis , holmes , and montgomery analyzed the three - dimensional dynamics of the toss of a coin of zero thickness,@xcite and emphasized the role of the bias induced by the initial conditions .",
    "others have studied the effects of bouncing on a substrate to understand how collisions can also lead to randomness.@xcite a recent book elaborates on the nature of randomness in mechanical games of chance , including the coin toss , by including the effects of air resistance and bouncing.@xcite these more complex models and experiments serve to confirm that the randomness in a coin toss stems primarily from the dynamical flow that acts on the uncertainty in the initial conditions .",
    "accounting for the finite thickness of a coin leads to a new possibility and increases the phase space of outcomes to include that of landing on an edge  an event that has a small but nonzero probability.@xcite for a cylindrical coin of thickness @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 , which is tossed and lands without bouncing , the probability of landing on a side is a function of its aspect ratio @xmath6",
    ". the coin will almost surely land on a face when @xmath7 , and will almost surely land on its side when @xmath8 .",
    "continuity suggests that as @xmath9 is varied , so will the probability of landing on either heads / tails or sides .",
    "this variation leads naturally to two related questions .",
    "what is the aspect ratio of a fair  3-sided \" coin ?",
    "a fair 3-sided coin is one that starts with a vigorous initial spin and large upward velocity , and lands on heads , sides , and tails with equal probability .",
    "how can we build coins with a prescribed probability for landing on their side or face ?",
    "mosteller@xcite described an anecdote about how john von neumann solved the problem of a fair 3-sided coin almost as it was posed , announcing the answer to an astonished audience ,  @xmath10 ! \"",
    "von neumann must have solved this problem using considerations of symmetry and the geometrical notion of fairness ; that is , assuming all possible orientations of the coin are likely , what proportions should the disk - like coin have so that the areal projection of its faces and sides on a circumscribing sphere are identical to each other ?",
    "although this assumption is plausible for a rapidly spinning coin , it neglects that the spinning coin must satisfy newton s equations of motion ( actually , euler s equation for rigid body dynamics ) and this equation enforces some conservation laws ( angular momentum in particular ) .",
    "this system also highlights a classical conundrum in probability known as ",
    "bertrand s paradox . \" that is , the probabilities of an event are ill defined unless the mechanism that produces the random variable is clearly prescribed.@xcite a way around bertrand s paradox is to use the principle of `` maximum ignorance , '' as given by jaynes,@xcite and then von neumann s result is correct . given the knowledge of a physical law , we must account for it , and we can not ignore the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "in this paper we use the geometry and dynamics of rigid body motion to derive simple analytical expressions for the probability of landing on heads , sides , or tails for a coin that is tossed vigorously , spins in the air , and lands without bouncing on an inelastic substrate , such as the palm of one s hand or a pile of sand .",
    "these expressions generalize the earlier results for coins of zero thickness , @xcite and allow us to see how probability depends on the geometry of the coin via its aspect ratio @xmath11 and the dynamical angle @xmath12 which characterizes the precession of the coin , as determined by its initial angular momentum .",
    "we find that a notion of fairness based on rigid body dynamics yields a fundamentally different probability distribution for the outcomes compared to the result based on the purely symmetry - based notion of fairness .",
    "in particular , the new criterion yields an aspect ratio of @xmath13 for an equal probability of heads , sides , and tails when the coins are spun rapidly .",
    "@xcite    simple experiments qualitatively confirm our theory and allow us to prescribe criteria for designing coins with a prescribed probability distribution of landing on heads , tails , or sides .",
    "our approach also allow us to illustrate the role of skill as exemplified by the ability to bias the outcome of the coin toss using the law of conditional probabilities .",

    "( b ) if the coin lands without bouncing , the side which faces up is determined by the difference between the dynamical angle @xmath16 and the static angle @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the aspect ratio of the coin .",

    "to link the physics of spin and precession to probability , we consider the phase space of initial conditions .",
    "because coins are usually flipped vigorously , we might imagine that the angle associated with the spin is uniformly distributed .",
    "this assumption does hold as shown by kemperman and engel,@xcite who proved that for vigorously flipped coins , i.e. @xmath77 , where @xmath44 is the precessional frequency as defined earlier and @xmath2 is the magnitude of the upward velocity , the quantity @xmath78 , modulo 2@xmath79 , approaches a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath80 . because the function @xmath81 in eq .",
