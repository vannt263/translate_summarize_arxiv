    "ranked set sampling ( rss ) is a powerful and cost - effective data collection technique that is often used to collect more representative samples from the underlying population when a small number of sampling units can be fairly accurately ordered without taking actual measurements on the variable of interest .",
    "rss is most effective when obtaining exact measurement on the variable of interest is very costly , but ranking the sampling units is relatively inexpensive .",
    "rss finds applications in industrial statistics , environmental and ecological studies as well as medical sciences . for recent overviews of the theory and applications of rss and its variations",
    "see wolfe ( 2012 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    ranked set samples",
    "can be either balanced or unbalanced .",
    "an unbalanced ranked set sample ( urss ) is one in which the ranked order statistics are not quantified the same number of times . to obtain an urss of size @xmath6 from the underlying population we proceed as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 sets of sampling units , each of size @xmath7 , be randomly chosen from the population using a simple random sampling ( srs ) technique .",
    "the units of each set are ranked by any means other than the actual quantification of the variable of interest .",
    "finally , one and only one unit in each ordered set with a pre - specified rank is measured .",
    "let @xmath8 be the number of measurements on units with rank @xmath9 , @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "suppose @xmath12 denotes the measurement on the @xmath13th unit with rank @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting urss of size @xmath6 from the underlying population is denoted by @xmath14 , where the elements of the @xmath9th row @xmath15 are independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) from @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the df of the @xmath9th order statistic .",
    "moreover , @xmath12s are independent for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that if @xmath20 , @xmath18 , then urss reduces to the balanced rss .",
    "the df of urss is @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as it is shown in chen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , when @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , for @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 , where @xmath28 one can easily see that @xmath29 is not equal to the underlying df @xmath30 , unless @xmath31 , @xmath18 , showing that the edf based on the urss data does not provide a good estimate of the underlying distribution @xmath32 . the properties of the edf of the balanced and unbalanced rss are studied in stokes and sager ( 1988 ) as well as chen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .     in this paper",
    ", we use the empirical likelihood method as a nonparametric approach for estimating @xmath32 . to this end , we propose two methods to estimate @xmath32 using the exponentially tilted ( et ) technique .",
    "the proposed estimators can be used as standard tools for practitioners to estimate the standard error of any well - defined statistic based on rss or urss data and to make inferences about the characteristics of interest of the underlying population .",
    "another interesting problem in this direction is to develop efficient resampling techniques for urss data , as in many cases the exact or the asymptotic distribution of the statistics based on urss data are not available or they are very difficult to obtain ( e.g. , chen et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "akin to the methods of modarres et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and amiri et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the new et estimators of @xmath32 are used to construct new resampling techniques for urss data .",
    "we study different properties of the proposed algorithms . for a hypothesis testing problem , about the underlying population mean , we show that the bootstrap tests based on the et estimators are asymptotically normal and exhibit a small bias of order @xmath0 which are desirable properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ et ] , we present et estimators of @xmath32 based on the urss data .",
    "section [ bt - urss ] considers two methods for resampling rss and urss data based on the et estimators of @xmath32 .",
    "we provide justifications for validity of these methods for a hypothesis testing problem about the population mean .",
    "section [ simulation ] describes a simulation study to compare the finite sampling properties of the proposed methods with parametric bootstrap and some existing resampling techniques for testing a hypothesis about the population mean .",
    "we consider both perfect and imperfect ranking scenarios , three different distributions and five rss designs .",
    "we compare the performance of our proposed methods with the one based on the empirical likelihood method studied in liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as well as baklizi ( 2009 ) . in section",
    "[ real data ] , we apply our methods for a testing hypothesis problem using a real data set consisting of the birth weight and seven - month weight of 224 lambs along with the mother s weight at time of mating .",
    "section [ concluding ] provides some concluding remarks .",
    "exponential tilting of an empirical likelihood is a powerful technique in nonparametric statistical inference .",
    "the impetus of this approach is the use of the estimated df subject to some constraints rather than the edf .",
    "et methods find applications in computation of bootstrap tail probabilities ( efron and tibshirani , 1993 ) , point estimation ( schennach , 2007 ) , estimation of the spatial quantile regression ( kostov , 2012 ) , bayesian treatment of quantile regression ( schennach , 2005 ) , small area estimation ( chaudhuri and ghosh , 2011 ) and calibration estimation ( kim , 2010 ) , among others .",
    "let @xmath33 be a generic sample of size @xmath6 from @xmath32 and suppose @xmath34 is the edf of @xmath35 which places empirical frequencies ( weights ) @xmath36 on each @xmath37 .",

    "we minimize an aggregated distance between the empirical weights @xmath36 and @xmath40 subject to some constraints on the @xmath40 s . more specifically",
    ", one chooses a distance @xmath41 and minimizes @xmath42 subject to @xmath43 and some other constrains such as @xmath44 , using the following lagrangian multiplier method @xmath45 where @xmath46 is often imposed under the null hypothesis in a testing problem or any other conditions that one needs to account for in practice .",
    "note that the minimization in can also be done by minimizing the distance between @xmath47 and any target estimator @xmath48 other than the edf @xmath49 .    the choice of the discrepancy function @xmath50 for the aggregated loss @xmath51 in leads to different et estimators of @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath52 is the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath32 under the kullback - leibler distance subject to the restriction @xmath43 , one often uses @xmath53 we propose two et estimators of @xmath32 based on urss data with sample size @xmath54 where @xmath7 is the set size .",
    "the et estimators are then used to propose new bootstrapping algorithms from urss data .      in this section ,",
    "we propose our first et estimator of @xmath32 which is later used to resample from within each row of @xmath55 .",
    "the idea behind the first et estimator of @xmath32 , for bootstrapping @xmath56 , is to find an estimator @xmath57 subject to the constraints @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",

    "it is worth noting that for hypothesis testing problems about the underlying population mean @xmath68 involving the null hypothesis @xmath69 , minimization in is done subject to the condition @xmath70 . using the optimum weights @xmath71 from the et estimate of @xmath32",

    "are obtained subject to constraints @xmath92 and @xmath93 , for @xmath18 , using the following lagrange multipliers problems : @xmath94",
    "in this section , we propose two new bootstrapping techniques to resample from a balanced or unbalanced ranked set sample of size @xmath6 .",
    "the first algorithm is based on the et estimator of @xmath32 in lemma [ lem1 ] to resample the entire urss while the second one uses the et estimator of @xmath32 in lemma [ lem2 ] to resample from within each row separately .",
    "we note that most of the bootstrap methods developed for rss are based on the edf and one can easily modify them using et estimators of @xmath32 .",
    "monte carlo simulation studies indicate that bootstrapping methods based on the et estimators of @xmath32 perform better than their counterparts using the edf .      to resample from the et estimator of @xmath32 given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined in we proceed",

    "* randomly draw @xmath98 from @xmath56 according to probabilities @xmath99 , order them as @xmath100 and retain @xmath101 . * repeat step 2 , for @xmath102 and @xmath103 to generate a bootstrap urss @xmath104 . * repeat steps 2 - 3 , @xmath105 times to obtain the bootstrap samples .",
    "one can easily validate the use of the et estimator of @xmath32 for different bootstrapping purposes .",
    "for example , suppose we want to carry out a bootstrap test for testing @xmath69 against @xmath106 , where @xmath68 is the unknown parameter of interest .",
    "using hall ( 1992 ) , the edgeworth expansion of the @xmath107-value for testing @xmath108 against @xmath109 based on a srs of size @xmath110 from the underlying population with the test statistic @xmath111 , is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a quadratic function and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the standard normal distribution and density functions , respectively .",
    "we consider the problem for a balanced rss case , as the following argument can also be applied to urss data with some modifications .",
    "let @xmath116 be a balanced ranked set sample of size @xmath110 from the underlying population with mean @xmath68 .",
    "we show that the et bootstrap approximation of the sampling distribution of @xmath117 is in error by only @xmath118 and the @xmath107-value obtained through the eat method has the desirable second order accuracy this is similar to results obtained in diciccio and romano ( 1990 ) . for more details",
    "see efron ( 1981 ) and feuerveger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath119 is a bootstrap sample generated from the eat algorithm .",
    "let @xmath120 be the bootstrap test for testing @xmath69 with p - value @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the mean of the bootstrap sample obtained form the et estimator of @xmath32 and @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "then , @xmath125 where @xmath126 , given by , is the p - value of the usual @xmath117-test based on a simple random sample of comparable size @xmath110 from the underlying population .    for simplicity ,",
    "we write the resampled data as @xmath127 . in order to test @xmath69 , and to ensure that the null hypothesis is incorporated into the et estimator of @xmath32",

    "the @xmath107-value for testing @xmath69 against @xmath138 using the bootstrap test statistic @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a quadratic function .",
    "now , the results follows from .      the idea behind this method is to use the et estimator of @xmath32 given by @xmath142 where @xmath143 is defined in .",

    "in this section , we compare the finite sample performance of out nonparametric eat and ear resampling methods with a parametric bootstrap ( pb ) procedure .",
    "the pb method uses a parametric test ( pt ) with an asymptotic normal distribution to test the hypothesis @xmath69 , where @xmath68 is the unknown parameter of interest and @xmath147 is a known constant .",
    "the resampling is performed using b=500 resamples and the entire experiment is then replicated 2000 times .",
    "we use several rss and urss designs with different sample sizes when the set size is chosen to be @xmath148 .",
    "we also conducted unreported simulation studies for other values of @xmath7 and we observed similar performance that we summarize below .    the rss designs that we consider are written as @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
