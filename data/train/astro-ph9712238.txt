    "astrometry and geodesy have undergone a revolution during the past three decades .",
    "this revolution was initiated in the mid-1960s by the advent of interferometry at radio frequencies using antennas separated by thousands of kilometers .",
    "developments during the following decades refined this `` very long baseline interferometry '' ( vlbi ) technique to reach its present capability of point positioning on the earth s surface at the centimeter level , and angular positioning for point - like extragalactic radio sources at the sub - milliarcsecond ( nanoradian ) level .",
    "these refinements are expected to continue until insurmountable problems are reached , probably in the sub - millimeter accuracy regime .",
    "geodetic measurements on the earth s surface have been enormously expanded and densified by satellite tracking methods developed during the past decade , but vlbi remains the prime technique for astrometry employing natural radio sources .",
    "it is unique in its ability to measure the earth s orientation in an inertial frame of reference .",
    "detection and processing of the extremely weak signals from distant radio sources requires long integration times , sophisticated data acquisition systems , and customized computers .",
    "analyses of vlbi observables involve an uncommonly broad cross - section of the disciplines of physical science , ranging from consideration of the effects of the earth s internal structure on its dynamics , to the tectonic plate motions and various terrestrial tidal effects , to quantification of turbulence in the atmosphere , to special relativistic description of the radio signals traveling from the distant sources , to general relativistic retardation . with the exception of gravimetric and oceanographic experiments ,",
    "vlbi is perhaps the most demanding technique for many aspects of global earth models .",
    "it therefore provides results that are used in a number of related fields .",
    "while extension of experiments to platforms in earth orbit and elsewhere in the solar system is in its infancy @xcite , the present review is limited to earth - based observations .",
    "a large portion of the modeling we shall discuss here is common to vlbi and earth - satellite techniques such as laser ranging to reflectors on the moon ( lunar laser ranging , llr ) and ranging to passive ( lageos , slr ) and active satellites ( global positioning system , gps ) . for these reasons ,",
    "it is important to review the complete details of current models of vlbi observables . following the principle that the accuracy of a theoretical model should exceed the accuracy of the experiments which it interprets by at least an order of magnitude , the vlbi model should ideally be complete at the 1 picosecond level .",
    "unfortunately this requirement is currently not satisfied by a number of parts of the model . as experimental techniques are refined , possibly to improve the accuracy by another order of magnitude",
    ", numerous aspects of the model will need to be re - examined .",
    "the field of radio astronomy was initiated in the 1930s by the discovery of celestial radio emission by jansky @xcite .",
    "development of instrumentation continued , and in the 1940s  @xcite used a parabolic antenna to construct the first maps of radio emission from the milky way galaxy at frequencies of 160 and 480 mhz .",
    "subsequent evolution of radio astronomy through the post - war years has been traced in the comprehensive collection of memoirs edited by . following the discovery of the powerful non - thermal radio sources called quasars @xcite , which are extremely distant and",
    "emit vast quantities of energy , intense interest developed in characterizing their intrinsic nature , as well as in using them as the basis for a novel astronomical reference frame . the 3rd cambridge survey @xcite and the parkes survey @xcite identified many of the radio sources used today for geodetic and astrometric vlbi .",
    "the basic ideas of the vlbi technique were first demonstrated in experiments detecting decametric bursts of jupiter by a group at the university of florida in 1965 @xcite .",
    "subsequent history can be traced from the first extragalactic interferometric observations by the nrao - arecibo group @xcite at 0.6 ghz on a 220-km baseline , the mit - nrao group (  @xcite ; 1.7 ghz , 845 km ) , and the canadian long baseline interferometry group (  @xcite ; 0.4 ghz , 3074 km ) .",
    "early work in geodesy , astrometry , and clock synchronization was done in 1969 @xcite , yielding accuracies in distances of 2@xmath1555 meters and in source positions on the order of 1 arc second . after the first decade spent in developing the technique , numerous applications matured in succeeding years using networks of fixed antennas .",
    "extension to transportable antennas was also implemented during the 1970s @xcite . during that period , several basic reviews of vlbi instrumentation , experiments , and",
    "analysis appeared as chapters in the series `` methods of experimental physics : astrophysics '' @xcite .",
    "some ph .",
    "d. dissertations of that era are those of , , and .",
    "after the currently standard mark iii vlbi data acquisition system was developed @xcite , large - scale international cooperation began in 1979 with the establishment of the crustal dynamics project ( cdp ) by nasa @xcite . in the 1980s ,",
    "radio interferometry progressed to the point of yielding some of the most accurately measured physical quantities .",
    "increasingly larger and more sensitive antennas were used to extend observations to ever weaker sources of emission , and the results have made important contributions to our understanding of a wide variety of astrophysical and geodynamic phenomena .",
    "such advances in instrumentation culminated in the construction of instruments such as the very large array ( vla ) in 1980 @xcite , and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) in 1993 @xcite .",
    "useful references which provide an introduction to the principles of very long baseline interferometry are several articles in the above - mentioned volume 12 of `` methods of experimental physics '' @xcite , the book by , and two reports by  @xcite .",
    "additional background material can be found in the review of geophysical vlbi applications by , and in more detail and more recently , in the three - volume compilation that summarizes the accomplishments of nasa s crustal dynamics project during the past decade @xcite .",
    "various periodic reviews , including the quadrennial iugg geodesy reports ( , ; ; ; ) , the iers annual reports , and the yearly reports on cdp results [ @xmath156  @xcite , more recently at ] , are also good sources for detailed information concerning current vlbi techniques and results .",
    "the international earth rotation service ( iers ) periodically publishes a compilation of standard models recommended for analyses of space geodetic data @xcite ; also available at . in large part , the model description in the present paper is in agreement with the specifications of these `` iers standards '' .",
    "the intent of this paper is to review astrometric and geodetic vlbi from a description of the experiments through analysis of the results , with emphasis on the details of theoretical modeling .",
    "section  [ expobs ] summarizes experiment design , single - station signal collection and recording , signal combination , and observable extraction .",
    "this section also reviews the general approach to extracting parameters of astrometric and geodetic interest from the observables .",
    "the three succeeding sections ( [ gdel]-[atmo ] ) consider the theoretical model in detail , partitioning the interferometric delay model into three major components : geometry , instrumentation ( clocks ) , and atmosphere , and presenting the best current models of each of these components .",
    "the longest section ( [ gdel ] ) deals with the purely geometric portion of the delay , wave front curvature , and gravitational bending , and considers time definitions , tectonic motion , tidal and source structure effects , coordinate frames , earth orientation ( universal time and polar motion ) , nutation , precession , earth orbital motion , and antenna offsets . sections  [ clk ] and [ atmo ] discuss the non - geometric components of the model : clocks and the atmosphere .",
    "section  [ curres ] presents a brief overview of the accomplishments of vlbi and its contributions to our understanding of astrometry and geophysics during the past two decades .",
    "section  [ impr ] outlines model improvements that we anticipate will be required by more accurate data in the future .",
    "the most convenient units for use in astrometric and geodetic vlbi are millimeters , picoseconds , and nanoradians .",
    "the first two are connected by the speed of light = 299,792,458 m / s @xmath1291 mm/3 ps , and will be used interchangeably .",
    "most commonly for the purposes of illustration , a 10,000-km baseline will be considered .",
    "a length change of 1 cm on such a baseline is equivalent to an angular change of 1 nrad ( 1 part per billion , ppb ) or 0.2 milliarcseconds ( mas ) ; the equivalent conversion factors in millimeters are 10 mm / nrad or 50 mm / mas .",
    "interferometric measurements permit resolution on the order of the wavelength of the radiation . for radio waves at the typical astrometric / geodetic frequencies of 2.3 ghz ( s band ) and 8.4 ghz ( x band ) ,",
    "the wavelengths are 13 and 3.5 cm , respectively .",
    "some recent activity is focusing on even higher frequencies , and numerous interferometric observations are planned at millimeter wavelengths , spanning the gap between the radio and optical regions . for experiments that are dominated by random errors , gains can be achieved by repeated measurements , thereby reducing the errors substantially .",
    "thus , the accuracy at x band may be expected to surpass 1 cm in many cases .",
    "early radio interferometric experiments employed antennas that were separated by distances on the order of 1 km .",
    "these experiments had the advantage that the stations shared a frequency standard , and signal correlation was performed in real time .",
    "such an arrangement is now known as a `` connected element interferometer '' to distinguish it from interferometers with separated elements that are not in direct communication .",
    "a connected element interferometer is a close analogue of the michelson stellar interferometer which manipulates signals with mirrors to produce a physical interference pattern at the detector .",
    "frequency standards ( `` clocks '' ) and the technology associated with measurements at centimeter wavelengths improved dramatically as a result of radar development during world war ii .",
    "it became possible to separate the two components of the interferometer with independent clocks and instrumentation , and to use high - speed data recording techniques , thus eliminating the need for close physical proximity .",
    "with such an arrangement there are no physical real - time interference `` fringes '' , although the terminology of optical interferometry has been carried over to the radio wavelength region .",
    "remote radio interferometry is now commonplace . with the two antennas separated by long baselines ,",
    "the experimental observables are no longer obtained in real time , but are instead generated by subsequent analysis of recorded information .",
    "such experiments have become known as `` very long '' baseline interferometry or vlbi .",
    "with the recent explosive advances in communications , computing , and data storage technology , connected element experiments over intercontinental distances may again become standard in the future .",
    "large dish antennas ( 20 to 100 m in diameter ) that are used for radio astronomy and vlbi are found in approximately 50 globally distributed locations . an equivalent number of sites have been occupied by smaller transportable antennas during the past two decades .",
    "the premier sites are at relatively high altitudes and in arid climates , which were selected to minimize the impact of atmospheric turbulence on measurement quality .",
    "a diagram of a contemporary vlbi experiment is sketched in fig .",
    "[ schemvlbi ] .",
    "two antennas , separated by a baseline @xmath73 , are simultaneously pointed at the same radio source , and detect the incoming wave front propagating along unit vector  @xmath157 .",
    "more than two antennas ( stations ) commonly participate in an experiment , but its fundamentals can be adequately illustrated by considering only one of the many pairs of stations .",
    "prior to its arrival at the first antenna , the signal has already been affected by the electromagnetic and gravitational fields that it encountered along its journey through interstellar space , the solar system , and the earth s atmosphere . between this time and the time of reception at the second antenna ,",
    "any motions of the earth also make their influence felt .",
    "all these varied aspects need to be taken into account in analyses of the experiment .",
    "we note that the vlbi technique is differential in the sense that the observables depend on the @xmath158 station locations and source positions , but they are fairly insensitive to the stations absolute geocentric locations and the origin of right ascension ( celestial longitude ) . other techniques ( @xmath156 , slr , gps ) must supply such information , which minimally consists of the geocentric position of one of the observing stations at a given epoch , and the right ascension of one source .",
    "the information content of the vlbi observables depends critically on the design of the experiment . the observing schedule ( station network , observation epochs , and local azimuth and elevation angles of the selected sources ) plays a crucial role in determining the types and precision of parameters that can be extracted in the subsequent data analyses . at a bare minimum",
    "there must be at least one observable for each parameter to be estimated .",
    "the experimenter must first decide how many parameters he wishes to measure . to consider a simple example :",
    "after having fixed the station location and clock parameters of a reference station , a typical astrometric or geodetic analysis will want to estimate , at a minimum , for each of the remaining stations three site coordinates , a zenith tropospheric delay parameter , and linear clock parameters ( offset and rate ) .",
    "in addition to these station - specific parameters , a number of `` global '' parameters are also usually estimated .",
    "these are common to the entire network , and describe the orientation of the earth ( 5 parameters ) and the positions of the sources ( 2 angular parameters per source ) ; the right ascension of one source must be fixed to establish the origin of the celestial reference frame . thus for an experiment with @xmath33 stations and @xmath159 sources , there would be @xmath160 parameters to determine , where @xmath161 . in recent years , analyses have tended to estimate increasingly larger numbers of station - specific parameters for the clocks and tropospheres , thereby increasing the coefficient of the @xmath33 term many - fold .    note that the observable delay in arrival times is approximately proportional to the scalar product of the baseline and signal propagation vectors , and thus contains information concerning both the station and source coordinates . with sufficiently redundant measurements , therefore , both the station and source coordinates are accessible to estimation , subject to the limitations imposed by only observing the scalar product . naturally , it is highly desirable to have more observables than the minimum ( @xmath160 ) required for a non - singular solution in the analysis .",
    "the additional observables permit reduction of the formal statistical uncertainties in the estimated parameters .",
    "they also allow the level of systematic errors to be characterized using various tests of the repeatability of the results .",
    "such tests may include root - mean - square of the residuals ( observed minus theoretical ) and repeatability of estimated parameters derived from subsets of the data .",
    "excess observables also leave open the option of estimating additional parameters whose importance may become known only after the data are collected . for all these reasons , the experiment design usually provides for many more observables than the expected number of parameters .",
    "in fact , a typical astrometric / geodetic experiment will have several hundred observables per baseline .    given a network of stations ,",
    "how are the source observations chosen ? to answer this question , and to generate an optimal observing schedule ,",
    "the experimenter is guided by a few key principles .",
    "first the experiment must have sufficient spatial and temporal sampling in order to permit unambiguous separation of the parameters of interest during analysis .",
    "as an example of the need for good spatial sampling , consider the dry zenith tropospheric delay parameter @xmath162 and the station local vertical coordinate @xmath163 . the measured delays @xmath139 will have sensitivities to these parameters that scale approximately as @xmath164 where @xmath7 is the elevation angle above the horizon .",
    "these two parameters will be correlated if @xmath7 is sampled only close to 45@xmath165 . in order to separate the parameters",
    "the experiment must observe sources over a wide range of elevations .",
    "in particular the low - elevation ( @xmath166 ) measurements will be most sensitive to the troposphere , while those at higher elevation angles will be most sensitive to the station vertical coordinate .",
    "next we consider the need for good temporal sampling .",
    "simply put , the experiment must sample the parameter of interest more quickly than it changes . for periodic effects",
    "this implies that one must take at least two samples within one full period of the effect of interest . in astrometric and geodetic vlbi",
    "one is often interested in tides with periods of 12 and 24 hours , 2 weeks , 1 month , a half a year , and one year .",
    "components of the earth s nutation have periods ranging from days up to 18.6 years . in practice experiments",
    "collect data at the rate of many observations per hour for a full 24-hour session .",
    "such sessions have been carried out many times per year during the last two decades , allowing vlbi to measure parameters which vary on all of the aforementioned time scales .",
    "day - long experiments also have the benefit of allowing observations through the full range of source right ascension .",
    "this minimizes problems that would otherwise arise in connecting observations from one right ascension zone to another . as a result",
    ", vlbi can avoid the zonal ra errors that have plagued optical observations which can only be performed at night . because vlbi measurements are done at microwave frequencies , they are also much less sensitive to weather ( clouds , rain ) than optical techniques .",
    "the experimenter must next decide how long to observe each source . while collecting more data bits",
    "improves the detection signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the desire to increase the snr must be balanced against the reality of finite recording bandwidths which are 50 - 100 mbits / sec for the mark iii vlbi system @xcite . as a result the optimal integration times typically range from 2 to 13 minutes . a technique known as bandwidth synthesis",
    "@xcite provides the highly accurate delays possible with a large radio frequency bandwidth , while requiring a recording bandwidth that is only a small fraction of the former .",
    "this technique has been essential in overcoming the limitations of currently available recording bandwidths . for very weak sources ,",
    "much longer integration times may be required .",
    "the coherent integration time may be extended considerably with the phase referencing technique @xcite , in which a strong nearby source is observed alternately with the weak source , and the phase of the strong source is used as a reference .",
    "lastly , we consider how best to use a given network of antennas .",
    "for antennas separated by a few thousand kilometers or less it is often practical to have all antennas simultaneously observing the same source . with such modest baselines",
    ", each station can observe over a broad spatial extent .",
    "however , for networks with baselines significantly longer than an earth radius , the desires for simultaneous visibility of the source and for broad geometric coverage start to be in conflict . because the area of the sky that is simultaneously visible from both observing sites shrinks rapidly as baselines approach an earth diameter in length , options for observing strategies become severely limited .",
    "the solution has been to create `` sub - networks '' .",
    "this observing strategy assigns a subset of the stations in the network to observe one source , while another subset of stations observes a different source .",
    "while this complicates the experiment logistics , it has allowed the design of experiments with very strong geometries .",
    "having considered the experiment design , we will now discuss how the signal is detected and recorded .",
    "for a cassegrain antenna ( see fig .",
    "[ antpic ] in sec .",
    "[ ant ] ) , the incoming signal first strikes the primary paraboloidal dish of the antenna , is then reflected up to the hyperboloidal subreflector , and finally into the feed horn on the central axis . for a prime focus antenna",
    ", the signal goes directly from the paraboloidal reflector to the feed at the focus position . past the feed horn",
    ", the signal undergoes an initial stage of amplification , either by transistor amplifiers such as field - effect or high - electron - mobility transistors or by a traveling wave maser .",
    "system temperatures typically range from 20 - 100@xmath167k at s and x band .",
    "after the first stage of amplification the signal is heterodyned from radio frequency to a lower intermediate frequency of several hundred mhz .",
    "next the signal is further heterodyned down to `` video '' frequencies . there",
    "the signal is band limited to a width of a few mhz , sampled , and digitized .",
    "lastly , it is formatted and recorded on digital video tape ( see the lower half of fig .",
    "[ schemvlbi ] ) .",
    "the signal is digitized at a minimum level of quantization to make the most effective use of the limited recording bandwidth .",
    "the digitized signals are recorded on high capacity video tapes for a period of several minutes , yielding a total of @xmath12910 gigabits of data . in routine observing sessions lasting 24 hours",
    ", this procedure is repeated many times , with as many as a hundred distinct sources sampled at several distinct hour angles .",
    "note that the independent station clocks must remain well enough synchronized to obtain signal samples that will form a coherent interference pattern .",
    "the signal flux density is on the order of 1 jansky ( jy @xmath168 w m@xmath169hz@xmath170 ) , necessitating antennas with large collecting areas and high sampling and recording rates , as well as highly sensitive and stable detectors and frequency standards .",
    "pointing and mechanical characteristics of the antenna structure must be sufficiently responsive to permit movement between sources widely separated in the sky within a few minutes .    the fundamental measurement in vlbi times the arrival of the wave front at the two ends of the baseline .",
    "in order to take full advantage of the timing precision possible with current frequency standards ( @xmath156 , hydrogen masers stable to 1 part in @xmath171 ) care must be taken to calibrate phase shifts induced by the measurement instrumentation .",
    "such phase shifts can corrupt the estimated phase and hence the group delay of the incoming signal . in order to correct for these",
    "instrumental phase shifts a technique known as phase calibration has been developed @xcite .",
    "this technique compensates for instrumental phase errors by generating a signal of known phase , injecting this signal into the front end of the vlbi signal path , and examining the signal s phase after it has traversed the instrumentation .",
    "this calibration signal is embedded in the broadband vlbi data stream as a set of low level monochromatic `` tones '' along with the signal from the radio source .",
    "typically the calibration signal power is @xmath172% of the broadband vlbi signal level .",
    "the tones are extracted from the data at the time of subsequent processing .",
    "after the signals at each antenna site are collected and recorded , the next step initiates the analysis of a vlbi experiment .",
    "the signals recorded at all participating antennas are combined pairwise , thereby producing the interference pattern .",
    "this progression is shown in fig .",
    "[ schemvlbi ] .",
    "the facilities for signal combination are called correlators .",
    "several such installations are presently operating in the u.  s.  a. ( haystack observatory , jet propulsion laboratory , u.  s. naval observatory , very long baseline array ) , germany ( bonn ) , and japan ( kashima ) .",
    "they consist of special - purpose signal processing hardware which is used to determine the difference in arrival times at the two stations by comparing the recorded bit streams .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite  discuss the details of this process . in brief , the two bit streams representing the antenna voltages as functions of time @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 , are shifted in time relative to each other until their cross - correlation function @xmath176 is maximized : @xmath177 @xmath63 is the averaging interval , @xmath178 denotes complex conjugate , and the time @xmath139 corresponds to the difference in arrival times ( the normalization is arbitrary for the purposes of our present discussion ) .    following , a simplified diagram of the processing of data bits in a vlbi correlator is shown in fig .  [ correl ] .",
    "for purposes of this illustration we have only shown 8-bit averaging , one trial delay offset ( known as a `` lag '' ) , artificially small delays , high fringe rates , and large amplitudes .",
    "various fixed delays which occur in actual implementations are omitted in order to emphasize only the essential steps .",
    "starting at the top , fig .",
    "[ correl ] shows a short segment of the bit stream from each of two stations .",
    "the data were recorded using 1-bit sampling ; when the signal voltage @xmath179 the bit is `` + '' , and when @xmath180 the bit is `` @xmath155 '' . some of the bit locations have been left blank in this illustration , in order to show more clearly only the eight bits that are followed through all steps of the example . in the second step ,",
    "the bit streams have been delayed by 2 bits for station 1 and by 1 bit for station 2 . in reality",
    "these delays are typically on the order of @xmath181 bits , where one bit is recorded every 0.25 @xmath125s . in step 3 ,",
    "the two bit streams have been cross - correlated .",
    "the resulting product is `` + '' when the corresponding bits from the two streams match , and `` @xmath155 '' when they differ .",
    "since the earth s rotational velocity induces doppler shifts on the order of @xmath182 times the observing frequency , vlbi observations at x band ( 8.4 ghz ) will have their signals oscillating at several khz .",
    "vlbi signals are typically very weak ( only 1 bit in @xmath183 or @xmath184 correlates between the two stations ) , and one must therefore average over many bits to detect the signal . to achieve this the signals must first be `` counter - rotated '' .",
    "this involves multiplying the cross - correlated bits by sine and cosine waves to remove the above - mentioned doppler shifts .",
    "thus counter - rotation may also be thought of as a digital heterodyning of the cross - correlation signal from khz to near zero frequency . in step 4 , the bits are counter - rotated by multiplying them with 3-level approximations of sine and cosine waves .",
    "( this counter - rotation can also be performed prior to cross - correlating in step 3 ) .",
    "step 5 : having been counter - rotated , the signal may now be averaged over many bits in order to allow the weak vlbi signals to be detected . for clarity",
    "the diagram shows averaging over only eight bits .",
    "the resulting cosine and sine sums are then root - sum - squared and normalized to obtain the signal amplitude , and the arctangent ( sine / cosine ) is taken to yield the signal s phase .",
    "note that for the purposes of this illustration the signal amplitudes are unrealistically large .",
    "several aspects of the process described above distort the extracted signal and must be accounted for .",
    "first we note that 1-bit sampling causes a loss in snr and introduces a @xmath185 scale factor in the amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the quantization of the delay to steps of one bit changes both the amplitude and phase , while the use of a 3-level approximation to the sine and cosine functions scales the amplitude .",
    "@xcite  and discuss these effects and their rectification in detail .",
    "the correlation process is carried out in parallel for many ( typically 14 ) frequency channels , with each channel producing average amplitudes and phases every 1 - 2 seconds , as described in the previous section .",
    "these results are stored for later analyses with post - correlation software , which is discussed in detail by .",
    "briefly , such code performs many functions in order to prepare the data for the final processing by the modeling / estimation software .",
    "some of these tasks are rejection of unreliable data by means of statistical tests , establishment of reference times @xmath64 and frequencies @xmath186 for the observables , phase calibration via the tones that were injected soon after signal detection , and removal of any rudimentary model information that was introduced during correlation .",
    "the core task of the post - correlation software is to take the set of phase samples @xmath187 from the various frequency channels @xmath188 and times @xmath189 , and to fit the set of @xmath190 with three parameters : the phase @xmath191 , the group delay @xmath141 , and the phase rate @xmath192 . to accomplish this ,",
    "the set of @xmath193 are first fourier transformed from the frequency and time domain to the delay and delay rate domain respectively .",
    "figure  [ frngamp ] shows the result of this operation for a high - snr observation .",
    "next the delay and delay rate domain data are searched for peaks ( at 763.784@xmath167ns , @xmath194ps / s for the example in fig .",
    "[ frngamp ] ) .",
    "this peak supplies the @xmath195 values for a least squares fit which determines the observables @xmath191 , @xmath141 , and @xmath196 ( phase , group delay , and phase delay rate ) .",
    "these phase - derived observables are determined ( for phase @xmath197 and circular frequency @xmath198 ) from a bilinear least - squares fit to the measured phases @xmath199 : @xmath200 where the phase , group delay , and phase rate are respectively defined as @xmath201 formal uncertainties of each observable are also produced ( for the example in fig .",
    "[ frngamp ] , @xmath202ns , @xmath203ps / s ) .",
    "when data at two distinct frequencies are present ( @xmath156 , s and x bands ) , charged particle ( ionospheric ) effects are removed by applying a simple model of dispersion , and combined ( s / x ) observables are formed ( see sec .",
    "[ ion ] , eq .",
    "[ eqiontau ] ) .",
    "problems with resolving 2@xmath204 ambiguities in the signal phase over large distances usually preclude the direct use of the phase delay observable @xmath142 .",
    "this problem can be overcome in differenced observations of pairs of nearby sources , for which `` phase connection '' is possible @xcite . under routine conditions ,",
    "the uncertainties in the delay observables are on the order of 10 picoseconds .",
    "numerous aspects of hardware , instrumentation , and software contribute to this limit @xcite . during correlation and post - correlation processing , the amount of data is compressed by a factor of @xmath205 , from terabits to kilobits .    to summarize , the interferometer is capable of producing four data types : phase delay , group delay , phase delay rate , and amplitude .",
    "the time rate of change of group delay can not be measured accurately enough to be useful for geodetic or astrometric purposes .",
    "the delay models discussed in secs",
    ".  [ gdel ] , [ clk ] , and [ atmo ] are directly applicable to either group delay or to phase delay .",
    "amplitudes are not usually modeled in astrometric / geodetic vlbi [ for an exception see  @xcite ] .",
    "phase delay rate models may be built from the delay models as discussed immediately below .",
    "the model for the time rate of change of phase delay must be constructed from either analytical or numerical time derivatives .",
    "if the latter route is taken , then only models of delay are needed .",
    "the model phase delay rate @xmath206 is approximated as a finite difference @xmath176 by @xmath207 in the limit @xmath208 , this expression for differenced phase delay approaches the instantaneous time rate of change of phase delay ( fringe frequency ) at time @xmath173 . in practice",
    ", @xmath209 must be large enough to avoid roundoff errors , but should also be small enough to allow @xmath176 to be a reasonably close approximation to the instantaneous delay rate .",
    "a suitable compromise appears to be a @xmath209 in the vicinity of 0.1 second .",
    "fortunately , the capability to model interferometer performance accurately is relatively insensitive to the choice of @xmath209 over a fairly wide range of values . to be specific ,",
    "if @xmath210 is expanded to third order in @xmath209 , the numerically evaluated rate becomes @xmath211 thus the error made in approximating the time derivative as @xmath176 is proportional to @xmath212 .",
    "this term amounts to a few times @xmath213 s / s for a 10,000 km baseline and @xmath214 s. comparisons of numerical and analytic derivatives have demonstrated equivalence of the two methods to better than @xmath215 s / s .",
    "prior to the detailed exposition in the next three sections of the theoretical modeling required by geodetic and astrometric vlbi , we present a brief summary of the vlbi modeling and parameter estimation process , its history , and key references . to form a perspective",
    ", we start by listing in table  [ errbudg ] the approximate relative importance of the various portions of the vlbi model . each tabulated maximum delay is given in distance units , and represents the potential model error that would be caused by its complete omission from the theoretical model .",
    "of the seven major components in this table , the purely geometric delay clearly dominates , since it can approach one earth diameter .",
    "aberration effects due to the earth s orbital motion are four orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the remaining components range over several orders of magnitude , with earth orientation , antenna structure , instrumentation , and atmospheric effects being the most important .",
    "most portions of the station coordinate and earth orientation models become significant only in analyses of data extending over time spans much longer than a typical observing session of 24 hours .",
    "the maximum delays arising from these models were therefore estimated for data extending over one year .",
    "models of the last four major categories , on the other hand , can exhibit their total variation over the duration of one experiment , and their maximum contributions were therefore estimated over a time span of one day .",
    "we also attempt to provide an `` error budget '' for the vlbi model by tabulating rough estimates of modeling uncertainties in the last column of table  [ errbudg ] .",
    "extreme situations are considered for these estimates : earth - sized baselines , extended sources , large antenna axis offsets , uncalibrated instrumentation , and observations at low elevations .",
    "it will be noted that many of the components can be modeled to accuracies that are several orders of magnitude better than their maximum contributions .",
    "thus , while this table indicates the general significance of the physical effects , their ranking does not necessarily reflect the uncertainties of their contributions to vlbi observables .",
    "interactions between theory and experiment are quite important in interpretation of vlbi measurements : empirical analyses point out inadequate parts of the model , which can then be improved . such iteration has taken place to varying degrees for different model components . presently , each of the three basic aspects of a vlbi measurement ( source , intervening medium , and receiver ) are seen to impose limits to vlbi resolution and accuracy that are roughly of comparable magnitude .",
    "the effort expended in improvement of various model components has by no means been proportional to their relative contributions to the observables .",
    "for example , the ionosphere can be nearly totally eliminated as an error source if the measurements are performed at two widely separated frequencies . in recent years , much more attention has focused on station motion effects , despite their smaller size . while recent methods of treating earth orientation and troposphere errors have produced substantial reductions of their contributions to the vlbi error budget , they nevertheless remain as two of the leading error sources in contemporary vlbi analyses .",
    "two other important errors are due to incomplete modeling of the time - dependent structures of the radio sources and receiving antennas",
    ". both may amount to tenths of a milliarcsecond ( mas ) ( 1 nrad , many mm ) . for day - long earth - based measurements , the dominant error is due to the troposphere : commonly used models of atmospheric propagation can be incomplete at nearly the 10 - 20@xmath167 mm level .",
    "in fact , present troposphere modeling is probably less accurate than the formal precision of the vlbi observables .",
    "details of tidal motions on the earth s surface have also not been fully characterized at the few mm level . for longer periods ( on the order of 1 year ) , aperiodic time - dependent processes come into play . at present , these are likewise not well enough understood @xmath195 at the nrad or mm level .",
    "the error budget of table  [ errbudg ] leads to a ( conservative ) total modeling uncertainty of approximately 30 mm .",
    "more complete models of the earth s tidal response and atmosphere , the physical processes in quasars , and the mechanical response of large antenna structures , will be required to realize the full potential accuracy of the vlbi technique and to reduce this limit to below 10 mm .",
    "it is hoped that this review provides a good point of departure for such model improvements .",
    "the @xmath195 model is refined by estimating model parameter corrections which best fit the data . in astrometric and geodetic applications of radio interferometry ,",
    "the values of the observables from many different radio sources are processed by a multiparameter least - squares estimation algorithm to extract refined model parameters . as the accuracy of the observables improves with advances in instrumentation ,",
    "increasingly complete models of the delays and delay rates need to be developed , which will be the thrust of this review .",
    "linear least - squares methods are employed to extract the best estimates of model parameters from the vlbi observables .",
    "fortunately , nonlinearities in this mathematical problem are small , and the @xmath195 knowledge of most aspects of the model is sufficiently good to permit efficient estimation via linearized least squares .",
    "the only operational complication is caused by the sheer volume of data : more than two million pairs of delay and delay rate observations have been accumulated in experiments through 1997 .",
    "this necessitates careful bookkeeping procedures to keep computing requirements manageable when tens or hundreds of thousands of parameters are estimated in simultaneous analyses of all extant data .",
    "the most important of these is the separation of the parameters into `` local '' and `` global '' categories in order to minimize the need to invert very large matrices .",
    "for example , in processing data which extend over many observing sessions , the clock and atmosphere model parameters apply only to individual sessions , while station and source coordinates might be determined by the entire data set .",
    "specialized least - squares or filtering methods are usually employed in vlbi parameter estimation .",
    "particular attention needs to be paid to numerical stability , and to retaining correlation information in experiments that are widely separated in time .",
    "the `` square root information filter '' ( srif ) @xcite is one such formalism for achieving these goals .",
    "severe limitations are imposed on the information content of the vlbi observables by the fact that the geometric delay measures only the scalar product of the baseline and source direction vectors .",
    "thus the data determine the @xmath158 directions of the sources and baseline , and only the orientation of the whole earth relative to the sources is strongly determined .",
    "weak ties of the baseline to geographic features of the earth are provided by effects such as the earth s motion in its orbit ( aberration ) , tidal displacements , and tropospheric delay .",
    "these fix the baseline in the terrestrial frame at an uncertainty level of a few tenths of an arcsecond .",
    "a more rigid link can only be provided by the introduction of a reference station with known coordinates ( @xmath156 , from satellite techniques ) in the terrestrial reference frame , and the adoption of a conventional origin for celestial orientation ( @xmath156 , the right ascension of one reference source ) .    a further complication in analysis is introduced by degeneracy in the parameter space of the multi - faceted model .",
    "linear combinations of a subset of the parameters describing one portion of the model may produce identical changes in the observables to those described by parameters of another portion of the model .",
    "the tidal displacements of a global network of stations provide an illustrative example : certain linear combinations of station tidal motions are equivalent to the three components of rotation of the earth as a whole .",
    "all such potential degeneracies must be identified and accounted for in parameter estimation procedures .",
    "the account of the physical models presented here is intended to be helpful in providing a general understanding of the analysis of vlbi observations . since modeling is intimately connected to the software that is used for data analysis",
    ", we take advantage of our own experience and adhere to the outline of the mathematical description of model implementation for the multiparameter estimation code `` masterfit / modest '' @xcite in the succeeding sections .",
    "the theoretical foundation of this large - scale computer implementation was laid by j.  g. williams  @xcite , who also developed many of the original algorithms .",
    "software and model development has continued at the jet propulsion laboratory since the 1970s .",
    "independent code of similar scope and ancestry is the `` calc / solve '' package , which was developed at the goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) during the same time period @xcite .",
    "this software has been used in the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) crustal dynamics and space geodesy projects ( cdp and sgp ) , national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) international radio interferometric surveying ( iris ) , and national earth orientation service ( neos ) analyses .",
    "it is an outgrowth of the original algorithms of and , and has been evolving predominantly at the goddard space flight center .",
    "numerous mutations of calc / solve over the years have resulted in at least three related , but not identical , packages used for vlbi analyses in germany @xcite , japan @xcite , and spain @xcite .",
    "more recently , independent software has been developed in ukraine @xcite , france @xcite , norway @xcite , and russia @xcite .",
    "there have been occasional comparisons between the various codes @xcite .",
    "these comparisons have been beneficial in exposing discrepancies , correcting software problems , and clarifying the physical models .",
    "such discrepancies have been surprisingly minor , given the complexity of these large computer programs .",
    "the geometric delay is defined as the difference in time of arrival of a signal at two geometrically separate points which would be measured by perfect instrumentation , perfectly synchronized , if there were a perfect vacuum between the observed extragalactic or solar - system source and the earth - based instrumentation . for earth - fixed baselines ,",
    "this delay is at most the light time of one earth radius ( 20 milliseconds ) due to non - transparency of the earth .",
    "it can change rapidly ( by as much as 3 @xmath216s per second ) as the earth rotates .",
    "while vlbi experiments are occasionally carried out with more than ten participating stations , the correlator generates observable delays and their time rates of change independently for each baseline connecting a pair of stations . without loss of generality",
    ", the delay model can thus be developed for a single baseline involving only two stations , which is what we present here .",
    "the geometric component is by far the largest component of the observed delay .",
    "the main complexity of this portion of the model arises from the numerous coordinate transformations that are necessary to relate the celestial reference frame used for locating the radio sources to the terrestrial reference frame in which the station locations are represented .",
    "we use the term `` celestial reference frame '' to denote a reference frame in which there is no net proper motion of the extragalactic radio sources which are observed by the interferometer .",
    "this is only an approximation to some truly `` inertial '' frame .",
    "currently , this celestial frame is a solar - system - barycentric ( ssb ) , equatorial frame with the equator and equinox of julian date 2000 january 1.5 ( j2000.0 ) as defined by the 1976 international astronomical union ( iau ) conventions , including the 1980 nutation series @xcite . in this equatorial frame",
    ", some definition of the origin of right ascension must be made .",
    "the right ascension is nearly arbitrary ( neglecting small aberrational , tidal , and gravitational bending effects due to the earth s changing position within the solar system ) .",
    "any definition differs by a simple rotation from any other definition .",
    "the important point is that consistent conventions must be used throughout the model development .",
    "the need for this consistency has recently led to a definition of the origin of right ascension in terms of the positions of extragalactic radio sources @xcite .",
    "interferometric observations of both natural radio sources and spacecraft at planetary encounters will then connect the optical reference frame and planetary ephemeris with the radio reference frame @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will mean by `` terrestrial reference frame '' a frame tied to the mean surface features of the earth .",
    "the most common such frame , which we use here , is a right - handed version of the conventional international origin ( cio ) reference system with the pole defined by the 1903.0 pole . in practice ,",
    "the tie is most simply realized by defining the position of one of the interferometric observing stations , and then determining the positions of the other stations under this constraint .",
    "this tie further requires that the determinations of earth orientation agree on the average with measurements of the earth s orientation by the international earth rotation service ( iers )  @xcite [ and its predecessor , bureau international de lheure ( bih )  @xcite ] over some substantial time interval ( @xmath129  years ) .",
    "such a procedure , or its functional equivalent , is necessary to tie the measurement to the earth , since the interferometer is sensitive only to the baseline vector . with the exception of minor tidal and tropospheric effects",
    ", the vlbi technique does not have any preferred origin relative to the structure of the earth .",
    "the rotation of the earth does , however , provide a preferred direction in space which can be associated indirectly with its surface features .",
    "in contrast , geodetic techniques which involve the use of artificial satellites or the moon are sensitive to the center of mass of the earth as well as its spin axis .",
    "thus , such techniques require only a definition of the origin of longitude .",
    "laser ranging to the retroreflectors on the moon allows a realizable definition of a terrestrial frame , accurately positioned relative to a celestial frame which is tied to the planetary ephemerides @xcite .",
    "the required collocation of the laser and vlbi stations is being provided by global positioning satellite ( gps ) measurements of baselines between vlbi and laser sites starting in the late 1980s .",
    "careful definitions and experiments of this sort are required to realize a coordinate system of centimeter accuracy .    except for sub - centimeter relativistic complications caused by the locally varying earth potential ( as discussed below ) ,",
    "construction of the vlbi model for the observed delay can be summarized in 7 steps as :    .",
    "specify the proper locations of the two stations as measured in an earth - fixed frame at the time that the wave front intersects station 1 .",
    "let this time be the proper time @xmath217 as measured by a clock in the earth - fixed frame .",
    "modify the station locations for earth - fixed effects such as solid earth tides , tectonic motion , and other local station and antenna motion .",
    "transform these proper station locations to a geocentric celestial coordinate system with its origin at the center of the earth , and moving with the earth s center of mass ( but not rotating ) .",
    "this is a composite of 12 separate rotations .",
    "perform a lorentz transformation of these proper station locations from the geocentric celestial frame to a frame at rest relative to the center of mass of the solar system , and rotationally aligned with the celestial geocentric frame .    in this solar - system - barycentric ( ssb )",
    "frame , compute the proper time delay for the passage of the specified wave front from station 1 to station 2 . correct for source structure .",
    "add the effective change in proper delay caused by the differential gravitational retardation of the signal within the solar system .",

    "[ clk ] ) , to tropospheric delays , and to the effects of the ionosphere on the signal ( sec .",
    "[ atmo ] ) .",
    "as indicated in step 5 , the initial calculation of delay is carried out in a frame at rest relative to the center of mass of the solar system ( ssb frame ) .",
    "first , however , steps 1 through 4 are carried out in order to relate proper locations in the earth - fixed frame to corresponding proper locations in the ssb frame .",
    "step 4 in this process transforms station locations from the geocentric celestial frame to the ssb frame .",
    "this step incorporates special - relativistic effects to all orders of the velocity ratio @xmath218 . from a general relativistic point of view",
    ", this transformation is a special relativistic transformation between proper coordinates of two local frames ( geocentric and ssb ) in relative motion . for both frames ,",
    "the underlying gravitational potential can be taken approximately as the sum of locally constant potentials caused by all masses in the solar system .",
    "the complications caused by small local variations in the earth s potential are discussed below .",
    "the initial proper delay is then computed ( step 5 ) in the ssb frame on the basis of these ssb station locations and an @xmath195 ssb source location .",
    "a small proper - delay correction is then applied to account for the differential gravitational retardation introduced along the two ray paths through the solar system , including retardation by the earth s gravity .",
    "a final lorentz transformation ( including all orders of @xmath218 ) then transforms the corrected ssb proper delay to a model for the observed delay in the celestial geocentric reference frame .",
    "note that , rather than transforming between frames , some formulations account for special relativistic effects as an @xmath219 term expanded to order @xmath220 .",
    "while this may be convenient for calculating the delay , it obscures the important physical insights that are gained by a clear definition of the reference frame used for each step .",
    "since the earth s gravitational potential @xmath221 varies slightly through the earth ( @xmath222 from center to surface ) , the specification of proper distance for a baseline passing through the earth is not as straightforward with respect to the earth s potential as it is with respect to the essentially constant potentials of distant masses . to overcome this difficulty , vlbi - derived station locations",
    "are now customarily specified in terms of the `` tdt ( terrestrial dynamic time ) spatial coordinates '' that are used in earth - orbiter models . a proper length that corresponds to a modeled baseline",
    "can be obtained through appropriate integration of the local metric @xcite .",
    "such proper lengths deviate slightly ( @xmath223  3  mm ) from baselines modeled on the basis of the tdt convention in the worst case ( a full earth diameter ) . in practice ,",
    "such a conversion is not necessary if baseline measurements obtained by different investigators are reported and compared in terms of tdt spatial coordinates .",
    "the model presented here has been compared @xcite with the `` 1-picosecond '' relativistic model for vlbi delays developed by . when reduced to the same form ,",

    "the remainder of this section provides the details for the first six steps of the general outline given above .",

    "note that the instrumental effects on delays measured using the multifrequency bandwidth synthesis technique @xcite may be different from the instrumental effects on delays obtained from phase measurements at a single frequency .",

    "we review the refractivity of the moist air composing the troposphere , discuss mapping functions which model the integrated path length through the troposphere , and finally consider the limitations to the mapping function models due to azimuthal asymmetry and turbulence in the water vapor distribution .",
    "permanent and induced dipole moments of the molecular species present in the atmosphere modify its index of refraction and thus delay the passage of radiation at microwave frequencies .",
    "the excess path delay caused by the troposphere relative to a vacuum is @xmath888 where @xmath35 is the index of refraction and @xmath522 represents the signal s path through the troposphere .",
    "since departures of @xmath35 from unity are small , normally the `` refractivity '' @xmath889 is used instead of the index of refraction .",
    "detailed discussions of the refractivity of moist air are found in , , or . to summarize these reviews ,",
    "the refractivity of moist air at microwave frequencies depends on the permanent and induced dipole moments of the molecular species present in the atmosphere .",
    "the principal species , nitrogen and oxygen , have no permanent dipole moments , and contribute only via their induced moments .",
    "on the other hand , water vapor does have a substantial dipole moment",
    ". induced and permanent dipole moments contribute to the refractivity as @xmath890 and @xmath891 , respectively @xcite , where @xmath29 and @xmath63 are the pressure and temperature of the species under consideration .",
    "this is the basis of the smith - weintraub equation @xcite : @xmath892 where @xmath893 and @xmath894 are the partial pressures of `` dry '' air and water vapor in units of millibars .",
    "the coefficients are taken from .",
    "the first term represents the aggregate induced dipole refractivity from all the dry constituents , and the second and third terms the induced dipole and permanent dipole refractivity from water vapor , respectively .",
    "thus the troposphere problem becomes a matter of modeling pressure and temperature ( @xmath893 , @xmath894 , @xmath63 ) along the ray path .",
    "typically this problem is simplified by assuming the troposphere to be a mixture of perfect gases with unit compressibilities which are nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "parenthetically , as noted by , at visible wavelengths water vapor has a smaller influence on refractivity , so that the third term is not needed to model optical refractivity .",
    "this simplifies troposphere modeling for laser techniques .",
    "one of the biggest obstacles to modeling the tropospheric delay is the non - uniform and highly variable distribution of water vapor .",
    "in contrast to the smooth exponential decrease of n@xmath854 and o@xmath854 concentrations with altitude , the h@xmath854o concentration generally decreases more rapidly within 1 - 2 km of the surface , and normally becomes negligible above @xmath1295 km altitude @xcite . figure  [ troph2o ] shows the altitude dependence of the mixing ratios of four major atmospheric constituents .",
    "the fractions of o@xmath854 , ar , and co@xmath854 are seen to remain nearly perfectly constant from the surface up to 50 km , while the water vapor fraction falls by over 3 orders of magnitude up to the tropopause altitude ( @xmath12915 km ) before leveling off at 7 ppm .",
    "water vapor content can also easily vary by 50% during the few hours around sunrise and sunset .",
    "weather changes have more pronounced effects on the wet than on the dry troposphere .",
    "the nitrogen and oxygen concentrations essentially scale with pressure while water vapor undergoes much larger concentration changes and redistribution with changing weather .",
    "the next step in generating the troposphere model is to obtain the integrated refractivity for a signal propagating from the zenith .",
    "the dry portion , primarily oxygen and nitrogen , is very nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium . as a result",
    "the zenith delay does not depend on the details of @xmath895 and @xmath63 along the signal path",
    ". the delay can be quite accurately estimated simply by measuring the barometric pressure at the surface . the dry zenith delay @xmath896 ( m )",
    "is related to the total surface pressure @xmath29 ( mbar ) as @xmath897 where the factor in the denominator corrects for a non - spherical earth @xcite , @xmath197 is the station latitude , and @xmath13 is the station altitude in km ( see eq .",

    "discuss the reason for using the total surface pressure @xmath29 instead of the dry partial pressure @xmath895 .",
    "they also explain the related and subtle distinction between ` dry ' and ` hydrostatic ' delay , which has been glossed over in the present discussion . typically , at sea level in the local zenith direction , the additional dry ( or hydrostatic ) delay that the incoming signal experiences due to the troposphere is @xmath898 nanoseconds or 2.3 meters .    at each station",
    "@xmath16 the delay experienced by the incoming signal due to the troposphere can most simply be modeled using a spherical - shell troposphere consisting of wet and dry components @xmath899 and @xmath900 : @xmath901 the total troposphere delay model for a given baseline is then : @xmath902 if @xmath903 is the unrefracted geodetic elevation angle of the observed source at station @xmath16 , we have ( dropping the subscript  @xmath16 ) : @xmath904 where @xmath83 is the additional ( dry , wet ) delay at local zenith due to the presence of the troposphere , and @xmath905 are the so - called `` mapping functions '' which relate delays at an arbitrary elevation angle @xmath7 to the zenith delays . note",
    "that since @xmath7 is the unrefracted elevation angle , refraction effects are contained within the mapping functions @xmath31 . these will be considered in some detail below .",
    "for some geodetic experiments , the observed delay can be accurately calibrated for the total tropospheric delays at the two stations , which are in turn calculated on the basis of surface pressure measurements for the dry component , and water - vapor radiometer ( wvr ) measurements for the wet component . at a fixed location , the dry zenith delay ( m )",
    "is related to the surface pressure @xmath29 ( mbar ) via eq .",
    "( [ eqtrpzen ] ) .",
    "the wet zenith delay @xmath906 can be inferred from wvr measurements performed in the vicinity of the vlbi stations at the time of the experiment .",
    "these corrections can be removed and replaced by an alternate model if desired . in the absence of such external calibrations , it was found that estimating the zenith delay as a linear function of time can improve troposphere modeling considerably .",
    "the dry and wet zenith parameters are written as @xmath907 where @xmath64 is a reference time .",
    "the time rates of change @xmath908 may then be estimated from fits to the data .",
    "the term `` mapping function '' is used to describe the relation between the tropospheric delay at zenith and an arbitrary angle @xmath7 above the horizon . throughout the history of vlbi ,",
    "extensive attention has been paid to tropospheric mapping functions , in view of the dominance of tropospheric delay mismodeling in the error budget . the simplest way to relate",
    "the tropospheric delay for an oblique path to the delay for a signal received from directly overhead is to assume a flat earth covered by an azimuthally symmetric troposphere layer . since the delay is proportional to the path length through this layer , the mapping function is then simply equal to the cosecant of the elevation angle : @xmath909 . even in the early days of vlbi",
    "it was found that this approximation was inadequate , and considered corrections accounting for the earth s curvature .",
    "this led to a mapping function in the form of a continued fraction , @xmath910    the simplest function , which was widely used in early vlbi modeling in the 1970s and early 1980s , was obtained by c.  c. .",
    "it truncates marini s continued fraction and replaces the second @xmath793 by @xmath911 in order to force @xmath912 at zenith : @xmath913 the dry and wet coefficients were determined from empirical fits to ray tracing results through measured average atmospheres : @xmath914 , @xmath915 , @xmath916 , and @xmath917 . it was claimed to be accurate at the level of 1% at @xmath918 , and to become rapidly more accurate as zenith is approached .",
    "as more accurate measurements in the 1980s demanded more accurate troposphere modeling , numerous improved mapping functions were developed .",
    "many of these have mathematical forms that are slight variants of marini s continued fraction , and contain constants derived from analytic fits to ray - tracing results either for standard atmospheres or for observed atmospheric profiles based on radiosonde measurements .",
    "the functions of , , , and ( nmf , niell mapping function ) fall into this category .",
    "most of them contain parameters that are to be determined from surface meteorological measurements .",
    "the nmf function is unique in that it attempts to represent global weather variations analytically as a function of location and time of year , and contains no adjustable parameters .",
    "the nmf mapping functions provide an excellent model for situations in which data are not available to supply optimum parameters for some of the alternative mappings .",
    "their seasonal , latitude , and altitude variations are based on interpolations of the u.  s. standard atmospheres of .",
    "niell presents evidence that short term ( hours to days ) surface temperature variations are unimportant compared to the seasonal , latitude , and altitude variations of the temperature in the region from a few km up to the tropopause .",

    "it also contains the most complete set of atmospheric parameters , and we will therefore present some details for this function .",
    "several reviews have recently evaluated the multitude of tropospheric mapping functions that are now available : , , and .",
    "because of its potential to provide the most complete description of the tropospheric delay , including use of @xmath919 temperature profile data , we will give some details of the lanyi mapping function .",
    "motivation for and details of its development were given by .",
    "it is based on an ideal model atmosphere whose temperature is constant from the surface to the top of the inversion layer @xmath877 , then decreases linearly with height at a rate @xmath76 ( lapse rate ) from @xmath877 to the tropopause height @xmath390 , and is constant again above @xmath390 .",
    "lanyi s approach was to develop a semi - analytic approximation to the ray trace integral ( [ eqraytrace ] ) which retains explicit temperature @xmath375 altitude profile parameters that can be supplied from meteorological measurements .",
    "the goal was to provide an accurate approximation to ray tracing in a form that was less computationally intensive than performing a full numerical ray trace for every observation .",
    "the mapping function is expanded as a second order polynomial in @xmath162 and @xmath920 ( plus the largest third order term ) . unlike all the other functions mentioned above",
    ", the lanyi mapping function is nonlinear in @xmath162 , @xmath920 .",
    "it differs from other mapping functions in the sense that it does not conform to the linear expression ( [ eqtrpdel ] ) .",
    "in particular , we note that there is a @xmath921 cross term which couples the dry and wet delays .",
    "this nonlinear term is present because for a given dry ( wet ) zenith delay the geometric path through the atmosphere is not independent of the amount of wet ( dry ) zenith delay .",

    "the tropospheric delay is written as : @xmath922 in order to factor out the @xmath923 `` flat earth '' model , where @xmath924 \\big/ \\delta + f_{b4 } ( e ) { z{\\rm _ d}}^3 / \\delta ^2 ~. \\label{eqtrpfe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath925 and @xmath926 are the zenith dry and wet tropospheric delays , while @xmath927 is the dry atmospheric scale height , @xmath928 , @xmath929 = boltzmann s constant , @xmath930 = daily average surface temperature , @xmath931 = mean molecular mass of dry air , and @xmath932 = gravitational acceleration at the center of gravity of the air column . with the standard values of @xmath387 , @xmath27 , @xmath933 978.37 cm / s@xmath934 , and an average mid - latitude temperature @xmath930 = 292 k , the scale height @xmath927 = 8.6 km .",
    "the dry , wet , and bending contributions to the delay , @xmath935 , @xmath936 , and @xmath937 , are expressed in terms of moments of the refractivity .",
    "the latter are evaluated for the ideal model atmosphere and thus give the dependence of the tropospheric delay on the four model parameters @xmath792 , @xmath76 , @xmath877 , and @xmath390 .",
    "note that lanyi s formulation ( eq .  [ eqtrpfe ] ) differs from the simple model ( eq .  [ eqtrpdel ] ) in the presence of the `` bending '' terms @xmath938 .",
    "these account for the influence of the dry and wet constituents in bending the incoming ray path .",
    "four meteorological parameters describe the temperature @xmath375 altitude profile in the lanyi model .",

    "table  [ lanyisurf ] summarizes their standard values , and also gives the approximate sensitivities of the tropospheric delay to the meteorological parameters .",
    "these values are calculated at @xmath939 elevation , which is the approximate lower limit of validity of the lanyi model . at this elevation",
    ", the ray path traverses the equivalent of approximately 10 `` air masses '' .",
    "a fifth parameter , the surface pressure @xmath940 , may be used to calibrate the dry zenith delay via eq .",

    "the full potential of the lanyi function can only be realized if complete meteorological information is available for the time and place of a vlbi experiment . when interpolated standard global values",
    "are used for the four parameters , it is essentially equivalent to the nmf mapping .",
    "while an exceptional amount of research has been devoted to improvement of tropospheric mapping functions during the past two decades , it is nevertheless becoming obvious that present measurement accuracy also demands characterization of azimuthal asymmetry and short - term weather variations .",
    "this may be achievable via real - time auxiliary measurements ( such as wvrs ) , or statistical models of temporal and spatial correlations .      in recent years",
    "the limitations of the mapping function have become apparent in vlbi observations .",
    "winds at high altitudes , unusually strong lee waves behind mountains ( @xmath156 , owens valley , california ) , and very high pressure gradients may all limit the accuracy of an azimuthally symmetric dry troposphere model based on measurements of surface barometric pressure .",
    "rough estimates indicate that , except in such unusual cases , errors in the simple model cause sub - centimeter errors in the baseline .",
    "the accuracy in more typical situations is expected to be limited by horizontal refractivity gradients caused by equator - to - pole ( north - south ) gradients in temperature , pressure , and humidity .",
    "these gradients were first accounted for in analyses of satellite laser ranging experiments by  @xcite .",
    "east - west gradients caused by motion of weather systems passing over a site may also contribute to the breakdown of the simplified mapping function model .",
    "the limits of validity of the azimuthal symmetry assumption in vlbi analysis are starting to be investigated @xcite .",
    "while the limitations of dry mapping are small and in the case of north - south gradients may be modelable , the wet component of the atmosphere ( both water vapor and condensed water in the form of clouds ) is not so easily modeled .",
    "it is known to be highly variable in time and space @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence @xcite is that it is `` clumpy '' , and not azimuthally symmetric about the local vertical at a level which can cause many centimeters of error in a baseline measurement .",
    "furthermore , because of incomplete mixing , surface measurements are inadequate in estimating this contribution which even at zenith can reach 20 or 30 cm .",
    "ideally , this portion of the tropospheric delay should be determined experimentally at each site at the time of the vlbi measurements .",
    "often the interferometer data themselves are used to quantify the effect of the water vapor as part of the parameter estimation process .",
    "independent quantitative estimates of the amount of water vapor along a path through the atmosphere can be made by employing `` water vapor radiometers '' ( wvr ) .",
    "these instruments measure the intensity of thermal emission due to transitions between rotational energy levels of the water molecule at microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "they are steerable in both elevation and azimuth , have half - power beam widths of 6@xmath941 9@xmath165 , and measure sky brightness temperatures at several frequencies near 22@xmath167 and 31@xmath167ghz .",
    "while there is not a unique correspondence between the sky brightness temperature and water vapor content , current data retrieval procedures appear to be capable of accuracies as good as several mm of path delay @xcite .",
    "recent measurements along the lines of sight of vlbi observations @xcite have yielded wet troposphere delays that agree with vlbi parameter estimates on the level of a few mm , and give a threefold reduction in residuals .",

    "such calibrations have not been routinely available for the bulk of vlbi data collected during the past two decades .",
    "because state - of - the - art wvr measurements have not been routinely available , vlbi analyses should at the minimum model the neutral atmosphere at each station as a two - component effect , with each component being an azimuthally symmetric function of the local geodetic elevation angle .    in an effort to properly account for unmodeled",
    "wet troposphere errors , a model of the spatial and temporal spectrum of wet troposphere refractivity fluctuations was developed by .",
    "this treuhaft - lanyi model assumes that tropospheric delay errors are dominated by fluctuations in the distribution of water vapor .",
    "furthermore , the model assumes that these fluctuations are well described by a kolmogorov spatial distribution that occurs in the bottom 1 - 2 km of the troposphere and is carried over the site by a constant wind on the order of 10 m / s .",
    "it introduces realistic variations of the troposphere with both time and geometry through this `` frozen flow '' assumption .",
    "the model is parametrized in terms of a `` rockiness '' coefficient , wind direction and speed , and the height of the turbulent layer .",
    "the treuhaft - lanyi model is used to generate an @xmath195 observable covariance matrix which is then included in the least squares parameter estimation procedure .",
    "it provides estimates of correlations of the tropospheric delays observed in different parts of the sky at different times .",
    "correlations between phase rate observables are ignored .",
    "demonstrates that they typically do not exceed @xmath942 , and decay to much smaller values on time scales of a few minutes . by accounting for spatial variations and not just temporal variations ,",
    "the treuhaft - lanyi technique differs from filters which parametrize the troposphere as a stochastic time - varying parameter @xcite .",
    "lack of knowledge of the parameters required by the covariance model presently limits its potential for improving vlbi parameter estimates .",
    "some of these parameters , which characterize the strength , extent , and direction of the turbulent flow , are starting to be quantified @xcite .",
    "an important benefit of this technique is that data strength is not used to estimate frequent troposphere parameters in cases where the latter are not of primary interest .",
    "thus the variances of the estimates of some important parameters ( @xmath156 , baselines , source positions ) are smaller than would otherwise be obtained .",

    "it must be noted that both current celestial and terrestrial reference frames exhibit a pronounced northern bias . due to the dominance of observing stations in the northern hemisphere , there has been nonuniform coverage of both the earth s surface and the celestial sphere . for example , fewer than one fifth of the 50 best - determined itrf sites are in the southern hemisphere , and fewer than one third of the 212 sources that are included in the new icrf are at negative declinations ( figs .",
    "[ icrf ] and [ itrf ] ) .",
    "it is expected that future development of observatories in the southern hemisphere will remedy this situation to the extent possible with the limited land area available south of the earth s equator .",
    "the motion of the earth as a whole , as well as its surface and bulk composition and structure , are also areas in which vlbi measurements have made significant contributions .",
    "there are basically two classes of earth - related applications .",
    "they pertain either to orientation of the structure as a whole , or to motions of its crust .",
    "both categories have varied root causes : solar system dynamics and internal , oceanic , and atmospheric processes on the earth .",
    "manifestations of most of these complicated motions are for the most part far removed from ordinary human experience .",
    "one exception may be the irregular slowing of the earth s rotation , which necessitates the introduction of occasional `` leap seconds '' in order to keep synchrony between the earth s rotation and atomic time .",
    "many of the remaining effects have amplitudes that are only on the order of a meter or less at the earth s surface , but their characterization is of crucial importance in building a coherent picture of our planet and its environment",
    ".    precise specification of the orientation of the earth is of practical importance , for example , in navigating spacecraft to other planets .",
    "the seemingly minuscule errors of parts per billion are magnified into errors of kilometers near jupiter .",
    "predictions of future earth rotation values ( particularly ut1 ) lose accuracy very rapidly for times past a few weeks after the date of measurement and extrapolation .",
    "continuous monitoring of earth rotation is therefore imperative for applications that require high - quality real - time utpm .",
    "substantial help in this regard comes from a perhaps unexpected source : the global distribution of atmospheric winds or more precisely total atmospheric angular momentum ( aam ) , which is widely monitored in real time for weather forecasting .",
    "measurements of the rotation of the earth and the wandering of its spin axis relative to the crust contain a great deal of information related to diverse physical processes . while to a good approximation the rotation rate is constant , it has slowed considerably over geological time scales .",
    "the length of a day was only 18 hours 900 million years ago as determined from recent analyses of tidal sediments @xcite .",
    "a number of phenomena come into play in determining the rotation rate , ranging from the lengthening of the earth - moon distance , to frictional and electromagnetic forces between the earth s core and mantle , to frictional forces between winds and ocean water and the surface .",
    "presently the rate of deceleration is much larger than the billion - year average , on the order of 2 ms per day , but it is known to have reversed sign within the last hundred years @xcite .",
    "the spin axis has a quasi - periodic motion that describes an approximate circle of @xmath129 20 m diameter ( see fig .",
    "[ pmplt ] ) in @xmath129  300 days whose center also wanders by tens of meters over decades ; the size of the circle fluctuates with a period of approximately 7 years .",
    "in addition to motions with respect to the earth s crust , the spin axis also exhibits motion in inertial space ( nutation ) .",
    "the two nutation angles are usually included along with the three quantities describing earth rotation to form a set of five `` earth orientation '' parameters . the radio interferometric technique , along with other space geodetic experiments , has brought about orders - of - magnitude improvements in measurements of small irregularities in these motions , thereby opening prospects for detecting numerous periodic and aperiodic processes .",
    "we summarize the present accuracy of earth orientation determinations , and present examples of contributions of the results to two diverse fields of geophysics .    with a network of several stations that are reasonably uniformly distributed over the surface of the earth , and separated by baselines on the order of an earth radius , it is possible to infer the earth orientation parameters to an accuracy level that is better than 1 mas ( a few nanoradians , or parts per billion ) .",

    "[ pmplt ] and [ rotplt ] show the variation of the position of the spin axis relative to the crust , and the rate of rotation , during a part of the 1980s and 1990s . as seen in fig .",
    "[ pmplt ] the spin axis follows a nearly circular path , with a diameter that oscillates between a few meters and 20 m with a period of approximately seven years .",
    "the deceleration of the earth s rotation rate is seen in the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ rotplt ] as a lag behind atomic time ( tai ) .",
    "the resulting excess length of day is seen in the top part of the figure : it exhibits a rich spectrum which is just now beginning to be understood in detail .",
    "the dominant oscillations are caused by the annual interchange of atmospheric angular momentum with the solid earth .",
    "experimental determinations of the earth s rotation rate show that it is not constant at the level of a few parts per billion .",
    "there are annual and semiannual cycles in the length of day , both with amplitudes of approximately 0.3 ms and minima in january and july @xcite .",
    "since the early 1980s it has been known that most of this variability is well correlated with the total aam @xcite .",
    "refinement of this correlation was made possible by the superior precision of vlbi relative to classical earth orientation measurements using optical techniques .",
    "variations in the atmospheric angular momentum are transferred ( via friction and forces on mountain ranges ) to variations of the angular momentum of the solid earth , conserving total angular momentum .",
    "this discovery has made substantial improvements in our ability to perform short - range forecasts of earth rotation .",
    "global weather measurements play a significant role in this process , and their rapid availability is crucial in improving forecast quality @xcite . as with most global geophysical measurements ,",
    "the spatial and temporal density is inadequate at some level .",
    "relatively few weather stations operate in the southern hemisphere , and the strong winds at high altitudes ( pressures of 100 to 1 mbar ) are significant @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dominant 0.6-ms effect of atmospheric angular momentum , a number of smaller meteorological and tidal effects contribute to irregularities in earth rotation . before considering some selected examples of these ,",
    "we discuss the remaining components of earth orientation : the two nutation angles that specify earth orientation in an inertial frame . in response to torques exerted by the sun and moon",
    ", the earth s spin axis oscillates in fundamental modes distributed over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the amplitudes of these motions can be calculated fairly precisely based on classical dynamics . at the discrimination level of modern measurement techniques ,",
    "however , the theoretical models are not adequate .",
    "the relatively poorly understood internal structure of the earth plays a large role in some of these motions , and empirical measurements have just begun to shed light on the underlying mechanisms . in the 1970s it became increasingly clear that the then - standard woolard nutation model was insufficiently accurate for analyses of modern data .",
    "based on the theoretical work of and , wahr developed a new nutation series @xcite , which was adopted by the international astronomical union in 1980 @xcite .",
    "these two series describe the time variation of the nutations in longitude and obliquity by superposing oscillations at a total of 106 frequencies , with amplitudes of 0.1 mas precision . only a few years after the adoption of the 1980 iau model",
    ", vlbi measurements revealed significant errors , predominantly at semiannual , annual , and 18.6-yr periods . initially pointed out these discrepancies , and gave improved estimates of a number of amplitudes from vlbi analyses .",
    "subsequently interpreted them as manifestations of irregularities in the figure of the earth s inner core .    as an example of the ability and evolution of vlbi techniques in the measurement of the earth s spin axis in inertial space , fig .",
    "[ nutplt ] shows plots of the two nutation angles @xmath462 and @xmath463 during the history of regular astrometric vlbi measurements .",
    "the plots show corrections to the standard ( 1980 iau ) theoretical model of nutation .",
    "it is apparent that there are highly regular deficiencies at the 10-mas level .",
    "yearly and semiannual frequencies are clearly visible , along with long - term ( linear and 18.6-y period ) discrepancies of considerable size .",
    "the dominant nutation in longitude , with a period of 18.6 years , is difficult to separate from precession ( 26,000-yr period ) with short data spans .",
    "only recently has the history of vlbi observations reached a time span of one 18.6-yr period , permitting this decoupling .",
    "determinations of the nutation amplitudes and precession at the levels of a milliarcsecond and a few tenths of mas / yr , respectively , have been made by , , , and .",
    "the value of the precession constant which was determined from optical measurements in the 1970s @xcite has been found to be in error by 3 mas / yr . most recently , it has been found that torques from bodies other than the sun and moon can contribute to nutation of the earth at a level of 0.1 mas @xcite .",
    "these have not yet been directly detected , but evidence is accumulating that accounting for their cumulative effect improves the fit of the vlbi model to experiment .",
    "another revision of the official iau nutation series is expected to include several hundred additional terms , and to correct many amplitudes on the basis of empirical vlbi determinations .",
    "gravitational forces from the solar system , predominantly the sun and moon , cause a rich spectrum in the tidal response of the solid earth and its oceans and atmosphere .",
    "direct motions of the earth s crust ( with amplitudes on the order of a meter ) are quite obvious in vlbi analyses , but smaller secondary effects on station positions and earth orientation also cause measurable effects , and need to be considered .",
    "one of the first estimates of the solid earth s tidal response was the determination of love numbers from vlbi by : @xmath945 , @xmath946 , and a phase lag @xmath947 .",
    "more recent work @xcite shows that the response factors at numerous tidal frequencies can be reliably obtained from analyses of vlbi measurements .",
    "perhaps the most important of the secondary tidal effects is the modification of earth orientation by mass redistribution in the oceans by global tides .",
    "this affects both the rotation rate ( ut1 ) and orientation of the spin axis ( pm ) .",
    "made the initial attempts to model these `` fast utpm '' variation amplitudes . in the early 1990s several independent determinations by vlbi and slr of the earth orientation amplitudes induced by 8 ocean tidal components gave results in good agreement with each other @xcite .",
    "initially their agreement with purely theoretical values based on global tide models was not good , but it is improving @xcite , as the global tide model is refined by topex / poseidon results .",
    "agreement is now at the level of 10@xmath948as .",
    "in addition to affecting the orientation of the whole earth , global redistribution of mass in the oceans by tidal action also causes local motions of stations on the earth s crust .",
    "these `` ocean loading '' amplitudes have been incorporated in vlbi models since the 1980s @xcite , and can amount to motions of several cm .",
    "although their small size places them close to the current resolution limit of vlbi , long data spans are capable of yielding significant direct determination of their amplitudes @xcite . by analogy with oscillations in the distribution of ocean water , variations in the atmospheric pressure at an observing site",
    "can also cause long - term vertical motions with amplitudes of many mm .",
    "this `` atmospheric loading '' has been detected in vlbi analyses @xcite .",
    "another minor systematic effect which has only very recently been identified is post - glacial rebound : the slow relaxation of the earth s crust in response to melting of the thick ice sheets which covered it during the last glaciation .",
    "the dominant motion is vertical , and theoretical models produce estimates of several mm / year @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , determination of the vertical component of station motion is notoriously weak relative to the two horizontal components , because of the strong correlation of the vertical with the zenith tropospheric delay .",
    "nevertheless , recent empirical estimates for a number of vlbi observing stations with sufficiently long observation histories @xcite have produced results that are in fair agreement with theoretical models @xcite .",
    "a limitation to the stability of the terrestrial reference frame , which is also of great interest for its own sake , is the motion of the tectonic plates that constitute the earth s solid surface .",
    "since this possibility was proposed by wegener in the early part of the 20th century , the existence of tectonic motion has been confirmed for time scales of millions of years .",
    "this was achieved by detailed cataloging of magnetization properties of crust near active plate boundaries @xcite . as the time base for space",
    "geodetic station motions became sufficiently long in the 1980s , the astonishing result emerged that present - day ( decade scale ) plate motions are very similar to those inferred from paleomagnetic data ( myr scale ) .",
    "this attests to the relatively smooth character of the forces driving plate tectonics . at present , the rates of motion of more than a dozen tectonic plates that have been occupied by vlbi stations are known to within fractions of mm / year @xcite .    as an example of the manifestation of tectonic station motion , fig .",

    "several points of interest are illustrated by the time history of this particular baseline .",
    "first , the north american ( alaska ) and pacific ( hawaii ) plates are one of the fastest moving pairs of tectonic plates , converging at nearly 5 cm / yr . second , there is nearly perfect agreement of the measured rate of change ( @xmath15546 mm / yr ) with the nuvel model rate of @xmath15545 mm / yr . third , the weighted root - mean - square scatter about a perfectly linear trend is approximately 7 mm , which is a typical result for a baseline of this length ( @xmath1294700 km ) , and amounts to 1.5 ppb .",
    "fourth , the evolution of the vlbi technique is illustrated by the increased frequency of experiments and the decrease in baseline length uncertainties during the 1980s and 1990s .",
    "fifth , even the current theoretical models have some systematic errors , which may be manifested in some of the departures from linearity , @xmath156 , in 1994 - 96 .",
    "finally , the general stability of the experimental techniques is shown by the smooth transitions at the epochs of both a large natural and a man - made perturbation at kauai : the hurricane damage in late 1992 and the transition to a new antenna , 40 meters distant , during the summer of 1993 are hardly noticeable in fig .",

    "in addition to the global effects of the atmosphere ( aam ) that were already mentioned in connection with the above discussion of earth rotation , we consider two additional aspects here . at best , empirical estimation can yield time series of accurate atmospheric parameters , whose applicability is unfortunately limited to the times and locations of the experiments .",

    "<S> interferometry at radio frequencies between earth - based receivers separated by intercontinental distances has made significant contributions to astrometry and geophysics during the past three decades . </S>",
    "<S> analyses of such very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) experiments now permit measurements of relative positions of points on the earth s surface , and angles between celestial objects , at the levels of better than 1  cm and 1  nanoradian , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the relative angular positions of extragalactic radio sources inferred from this technique presently form the best realization of an inertial reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> this review summarizes the current status of radio interferometric measurements for astrometric and geodetic applications . </S>",
    "<S> it emphasizes the theoretical models that are required to extract results from the vlbi observables at present accuracy levels . </S>",
    "<S> an unusually broad cross - section of physics contributes to the required modeling . </S>",
    "<S> both special and general relativity need to be considered in properly formulating the geometric part of the propagation delay . while high - altitude atmospheric charged particle ( ionospheric ) effects are easily calibrated for measurements employing two well separated frequencies , the contribution of the neutral atmosphere at lower altitudes is more difficult to remove . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , mismodeling of the troposphere remains the dominant error source . </S>",
    "<S> plate tectonic motions of the observing stations need to be taken into account , as well as the non - point - like intensity distributions of many sources . </S>",
    "<S> numerous small periodic and quasi - periodic tidal effects also make important contributions to space geodetic observables at the centimeter level , and some of these are just beginning to be characterized . </S>",
    "<S> another area of current rapid advances is the specification of the orientation of the earth s spin axis in inertial space : nutation and precession . </S>",
    "<S> highlights of the achievements of vlbi are presented in four areas : reference frames , earth orientation , atmospheric effects on microwave propagation , and relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the order - of - magnitude improvement of accuracy that was achieved during the last decade has provided essential input to geophysical models of the earth s internal structure . </S>",
