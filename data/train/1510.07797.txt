    "the beam pattern is defined by a broad - band ring - loaded corrugated feedhorn @xcite which couples light onto a planar detector chip that sits above a waveguide back short to prevent leakage of electromagnetic fields .",

    "the fts was calibrated using a microwave transmitter in a frequency range between 80 and 170 ghz .",
