    "the debate about the distance to the lmc has an epic history full of controversial and dramatic claims ( walker 2003 ) , and yet in recent years a standard distance modulus has emerged due primarily to the completion of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) key project to measure the hubble constant ( freedman et al .",
    "the standard modulus , @xmath1 mag , yields @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ( total error ) in excellent agreement with that derived from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ : @xmath4 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which lends considerable support to its accuracy .",
    "moreover , it is a recent trend in the literature that most new lmc distance measurements indicate @xmath5 = 18.5 mag , and that many systematic errors in prior studies are being found and corrected . in order to illustrate the trend , this review",
    "is restricted to mostly refereed journal papers published since january , 2002 .",
    "alves et al .  ( 2002 ) presented and analyzed the first near - infrared data for lmc red clump giants .",
    "the @xmath6-band data were obtained with the sofi infrared imager at the new technology telescope .",
    "additional @xmath7 and @xmath8 data were obtained with wfpc2 onboard the _ hst_. a comparison of multiwavelength luminosity functions of the lmc red clump with those of the _ hipparcos _ red clump yielded simultaneously the mean interstellar reddening correction and true lmc distance modulus : @xmath9 ( random and systematic error , respectively ) .",
    "pietrzyski & gieren ( 2002 ) also used @xmath6-band red clump data to derive @xmath10 , as did sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who obtained @xmath11 .",
    "the reddening correction accounts for the 0.02 mag discrepancy between the results of alves et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and pietrzyski & gieren ( 2002 ) .",
    "sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) include the systematic errors associated with the red clump population correction and the geometric tilt of the lmc in their reported error bar .",
    "despite these minor differences , the _ hipparcos_-calibrated red clump distance to the lmc has probably converged .",
    "it is encouraging that 3 independent estimates of the apparent @xmath6 magnitude of the lmc red clump all agree to within an accuracy of 12% .",
    "figure 1 shows the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) in the lmc . these are unpublished _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 color - magnitude data for 17 different fields on lines - of - sight to lmc microlensing events .",
    "i have applied the average reddening correction derived from multiband red clump data for 6 of the fields ( alves et al .",
    "the trgb calibration from bellazini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is shown assuming @xmath12 mag .",
    "the weak metallicity dependence of the calibration is expressed in terms of color .",
    "note that the colors of the lmc trgb stars suggest a range of metallicities from [ fe / h ] = @xmath13 to @xmath14 dex with a mode of about @xmath15 dex .",
    "this comparison shows that the trgb and red clump methods yield superb agreement with the standard lmc distance modulus",
    ".    0.3 cm",
    "recent distance estimates based on cepheid variable stars in the lmc have made use of the densely sampled light curves available from microlensing surveys like macho and ogle .",
    "theoretical pulsation models reproduce the detailed shapes of period - folded light curves , and best - fit models yield the fundamental parameters of each cepheid , like luminosity and effective temperature , and hence the distance .",
    "the cepheids used for this analysis are those which display a secondary luminosity maximum each pulsation cycle . these so - called `` bump '' cepheids collectively represent the hertzsprung progression because the bumps occur at earlier phases in the pulsation cycle as period increases .",
    "bono et al .",
    "( 2002 ) modeled the ogle @xmath8-band light curves for 2 bump cepheids and found @xmath16 mag .",
    "keller & wood ( 2002 ) modeled the macho @xmath7 and @xmath17 light curves for 20 bump cepheids to derive @xmath18 .",
    "both studies also found a level of core overshoot in good agreement with the calibration from eclipsing binaries ( ribas et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the use of pulsational models of bump cepheids to derive the lmc distance is a promising method .",
    "however , only a small fraction of the available data have been used so far .",
    "i have identified 183 bump cepheids with periods of 5 to 25 days in the macho database , and out of these 117 are also found in the ogle database , and 89 in the catalog of four - color light curves published by sebo et al .",
    "furthermore , 153 of these bump cepheids are found in the 2mass database , which provides partial light curve coverage in the near - infrared .",
    "models will eventually be constructed for all of the lmc bump cepheids , and parameter estimation will employ more multiwavelength data .",
    "table  1 lists the average differences between the ( intensity - weighted ) mean magnitudes published by ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) and sebo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) relative to the macho data for bump cepheids .",
    "the implication is a @xmath7-band offset of @xmath19  mag between sebo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and ogle ; however , sebo et al .  ( 2002 ) report a + 0.04 mag offset . hence the different comparisons of the same two datasets yield different results .",
    "i note that their average is weighted differently and their comparison is only for cepheids with periods greater than 10 days .",
