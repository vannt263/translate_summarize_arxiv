    "in this paper we revisit the discussion of the heat kernel and the unusual properties of the heat trace expansion for a general self - adjoint realization in @xmath0 of the regular - singular operator ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the space of smooth functions with compact support in @xmath4 .",
    "the heat trace expansion of @xmath5 for @xmath6 is well - understood in @xcite and in @xcite , and in fact does not exhibit new phenomena , compare in particular the general discussion of gil , krainer and mendoza @xcite .",
    "the intricate case is rather @xmath7 , where the relation between the explicit approaches of @xcite , @xcite and the methods of the heat kernel construction in @xcite is less obvious .",
    "the regular - singular operators @xmath5 arise naturally in the spectral geometry of spaces with isolated conical singularities , modelled by a bounded generalized cone @xmath8 over a closed riemannian manifold @xmath9 of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "this includes the example of a higher - dimensional disc @xmath11 , where the euclidean metric takes the form @xmath12 with respect to standard polar coordinates .",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath13 is a symmetric operator in @xmath14 and takes the form @xmath15 under the unitary transformation ( see @xcite )    @xmath16    the laplacian @xmath17 unitarily transforms to @xmath18 the spectral decomposition on the cross section @xmath19 decomposes @xmath20 into a direct sum of operators @xmath5 over the @xmath21-eigenspaces of @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested here in the operator over the kernel of @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) @xmath24    the spectral properties of @xmath25 for general self - adjoint boundary conditions have been subject of careful analysis by falomir , muschietti , pisani and seeley in @xcite as well as by kirsten , loya and park in @xcite . in both instances",
    "the authors uncovered new unsual phenomena in the heat trace expansion of @xmath25 , if the boundary conditions at @xmath26 do not define the friedrichs extension .",
    "their ( and our ) result reads as follows .    [ main ] the self - adjoint boundary conditions of @xmath25 at @xmath26 are parametrized by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the friedrichs extension .",
    "we write @xmath29 for the corresponding self - adjoint realization . with @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the euler - mascheroni constant , we find for @xmath32 @xmath33    note the absense of fractional @xmath34-powers due to missing contribution from the regular boundary in the present setup .",
    "both discussions of @xcite and @xcite have been performed independently from the earlier work by mooers @xcite , who in particular constructed the heat kernel of @xmath25 for a general self - adjoint realization and observed its non - polyhomogeneity in case of a non - friedrichs extension at @xmath26 .",
    "however , @xcite did not elaborate further on the particular structure of the non - polyhomogeneous heat kernel and its heat trace behaviour , leading to the natural question of whether her analysis can be reconciled with the explicit results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hereby , certain computational inconsistencies in @xcite become apparent , see remark [ error ] .    in this note",
    "we address this issue and show how the heat trace expansion results in @xcite follow straightforwardly from the heat kernel construction of mooers in @xcite . at various points we chose to provide arguments , alternative to @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first classify the self - adjoint realizations for @xmath25 in  [ self - adjoint - section ] , and study the solution to the signaling problem in  [ signal - section ] . the solution to the signaling problem is the central ingredient in the construction of the heat kernel for general self - adjoint boundary conditions , which is explained in ",
    "[ heat - section ] and is basically a revision of @xcite . in  [ auxiliary ] we establish well - definement of the various expressions in the general heat kernel formula . in the final  [ unusual - section ] we derive the heat trace expansion directly from the heat kernel structure in  [ heat - section ] , thus reproving theorem [ main ] by a different method .",
    "the author would like to thank thomas krainer for helpful remarks and gratefully acknowledges the support by the hausdorff research institute at the university of bonn .",
    "consider the differential operator    @xmath35    acting on @xmath36 .",
    "we always denote by @xmath37 the space of smooth functions with compact support in @xmath38 .",
    "we define the _ minimal _ closed extension @xmath39 to be the graph closure of @xmath25 , which is a densely defined and symmetric operator .",
    "maximal _ closed extension is @xmath40 .",
    "we then have the following well - known characterization of the maximal domain @xmath41 , written out in various sources , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ max - domain ] let @xmath42 .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath43 depending only on @xmath44 , and a continuously differentiable @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 moreover , for any @xmath50 the following green s identity holds @xmath51       an extension @xmath52 is self - adjoint , if @xmath53    consequently we obtain a self - adjoint extension of @xmath25 by choosing the following boundary operators on @xmath54 @xmath55 we define then @xmath56 the extensions @xmath57 define self - adjoint realizations of @xmath25 by proposition [ max - domain ] , and in fact classify completely all self - adjoint boundary conditions at @xmath26 .",
    "the fundamental component in the heat kernel construction of mooers in @xcite is the _ signaling solution _ @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , defined for any given @xmath60 , as a solution to the so - called _ signaling problem _",

    "similarly , differentiating @xmath80 explicitly in the first argument , we find @xmath81 and consequently , @xmath82 .",
    "it remains to identify @xmath83 .",
    "we write @xmath84 where @xmath85 by smoothness of @xmath86 . then , substituting @xmath87 in the integrals below , we find @xmath88 for the first integral and @xmath89 ( note @xmath78 is fixed ) we obtain @xmath90 for the second integral @xmath91 we obtain similarly @xmath92 as @xmath93 , and hence indeed find @xmath94 .    it should be noted that the naive expansion of @xmath75 does not lead to a closed expression of @xmath95 , which requires rather integral transform arguments and is the fundamental aspect of the next section .",
    "we can now discuss the heat kernel for a self - adjoint operator @xmath96 with @xmath27 . by the duhamel principle ,",
    "the heat trace expansion of any self - adjoint extension of @xmath25 in @xmath0 with boundary conditions @xmath97 at @xmath26 and separated boundary conditions at @xmath98 , differs from the heat trace expansion of @xmath29 ( trace integral taken over @xmath99 $ ] ) by the classical trace contribution from the regular boundary @xmath98 and @xmath100 , cf .",
    "for instance lesch ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.4.11 ) .",

    "note @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the convolution kernel mapping @xmath110 to @xmath95 .",
    "we make @xmath111 explicit using the laplace transform . for any @xmath112 , not growing exponentially as @xmath113 , the laplace transform is defined as follows @xmath114 the inverse laplace transform is given for any @xmath115 and analytic @xmath116 , integrable over @xmath117 , by @xmath118    [ g ] @xmath119    we compute , cf . @xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the modified bessel function of second kind , and in the definition of @xmath122 we fix the branch of logarithm in @xmath123 .",
    "we assume that @xmath124 is not of exponential growth as @xmath113 , so that @xmath125 is well - defined for @xmath126 .",
    "the bessel function @xmath127 admits an asymptotic expansion , see @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the euler constant .",
    "consequently @xmath130 taking the inverse laplace transform , we obtain @xmath131 where each @xmath132 exists and @xmath133 , uniformly as @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , indeed @xmath134 this yields the following explicit expression for the laplace transform of @xmath109 @xmath135    as already noted at the end of  [ signal - section ] , the explicit expression for @xmath136 , obtained in lemma [ g ] by means of integral transforms , can not be obtained by naive expansion of @xmath80 in @xmath137 directly .",
    "[ error ] a similar argument may be performed using fourier transformation instead of the laplace transform .",
    "the fourier transform has been used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.4 ) , where however the factor @xmath138 from is incorrectly missing .",
    "more precisely , the scaling argument outlined in @xcite determines the fourier and the laplace transform of @xmath109 to be given by @xmath139 only up to an additive constant , which can not be specified by her method .",
    "returning back to and taking the laplace transform of its third identity , we obtain @xmath140    where the inverse laplace transform in the formula for @xmath141 is given explicitly as follows .",
    "for any @xmath142 and @xmath143 we have a priori @xmath144 the latter two integrals behave as @xmath145 , as @xmath146 , and hence vanish in the limit . consequently @xmath147    well - definement of @xmath148 , and regularity of @xmath149 is not obvious and requires a detailed analysis of @xmath141 , which is the content of  [ auxiliary ] below .",
