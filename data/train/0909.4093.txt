    "variability in non - magnetic , cataclysmic variable ( cv ) close binaries has been largely attributed to instabilities .",
    "outbursts in recurrent and classical novae can be caused by thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf or by a thermal and viscous instability in the disk .",
    "the latter outburst involves cycling from low - to - high thermal and viscous states ( see e.g. , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 and references within ) , and thus cycling from low - to - high mass transfer rates ( see e.g. , lasota 2001 ) , that results in a release of accretion energy as mass is drained onto the white dwarf .",
    "this type of outburst is similar to that experienced by cv dwarf novae ( dn ) , but larger in scale , and by transient x - ray binaries that have neutron stars or black holes as the primary star in the binary .",
    "another type of instability , a tidal instability , results in cv dn su uma and nova - like ( nl ) outbursts , of which the larger amplitude and longer duration superoutbursts involve both a thermal - viscous instability and a tidal instability . both cv dn su uma and nl outbursts and superoutbursts show characterisitc hump - shaped modulations , known as positive superhumps , in their light curves .",
    "positive superhumps have periods that are a few percent longer than the orbital period .",
    "in addition to positive superhumps , some non - magnetic cv dn systems ( e.g. , tt ari ) show negative superhumps in their light curves .",
    "these negative superhumps have a period that is a few percent shorter than the orbital period .",
    "negative superhumps are suggested to be a consequence of a partially tilted disk ( patterson et al .",
    "1993 ) or are related to a warped accretion disk ( petterson 1977 ; murray & armitage 1998 ; terquem & papaloizou 2000 ; murray et al .",
    "2002 ; foulkes , haswell , & murray 2006 ) .",
    "our previous numerical simulations ( wood , montgomery , & simpson 2000 ; montgomery 2004 , montgomery 2009 ) show that negative superhumps can be produced by a disk fully tilted out of the orbital plane . in montgomery ( 2009 )",
    ", we suggest that the source to the negative superhump is extra light from inner annuli of a tilted accretion disk , and this extra light waxes and wanes with the amount of gas stream overflow and particle migration to inner annuli as the secondary orbits .",
    "accretion disks have been postulated to warp or tilt via a potpourri of sources .",
    "for example , disk tilt in x - ray binaries can be from gas streaming at an upward angle from the inner lagrange point for one half of the orbit and at a downward angle for the second half of the orbit ( boynton et al . 1980 ) .",
    "in some cvs , a disk tilt can be held constant by a gas stream that is fed via the magnetic field of the secondary ( barrett , odonoghue , & warner 1988 ) . also for cv systems , a disk tilt instability can result from a coupling of an eccentric instability to lindblad resonances ( lubow 1992 ) .",
    "a vertical resonant oscillation of the disk midplane can be caused by tidal interactions between a massive secondary and a coplanar primary ( lubow & pringle 1993 ) . a warping instability can be caused by irradiation from the primary ( pringle 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "a warping can be caused by direct tidal forces from a secondary orbiting on an inclined orbit ( e.g. , papaloizou & terquem 1995 , larwood et al .",
    "1996 , larwood 1997 , larwood & papaloizou 1997 ) . a disk tilt can be induced if the secondary has a body axis that is tilted relative to the orbital plane ( roberts 1974 ) .",
    "a disk warp can be caused by misalignments of the spin axis of a compact and/or magnetized primary and the disk axis ( see e.g. , kumar 1986 , 1989 ) . to date , no consensus has been found regarding the source to a disk tilt or warp .",
    "we do acknowledge that murray & armitage ( 1998 ) find that cv dn accretion disks do not tilt significantly out of the orbital plane by instabilities .",
    "regardless of how an accretion disk tilts or warps , non - coplaner accretion disks should precess in the retrograde direction , that is , the direction opposite to spin and orbital motion .",
    "precession is the motion of a body axis around a fixed axis in space .",
    "retrograde precessional motion traces out a cone around the cone s symmetric axis , a fixed axis in space .",
    "two sources are known to generate retrograde precession .",
    "one is torques acting on the body .",
    "a second kind is fast precession which applies to bodies that are free .",
    "an example of the latter is a coin thrown into the air in such a way that the coin spins fast , but the normal to the coin wobbles .",
    "of the two , many typically cite torques as the source to retrograde precession .",
    "for example , retrograde precessional activity has been suggested for x - ray binaries ( e.g. , katz 1973 , larwood 1998 , wijers & pringle 1999 ) , for common systems that produce jets ( e.g. , livio 1999 ) , for protostars ( e.g. , papaloizou & terquem 1995 , larwood et . al",
    ". 1996 , larwood 1997 ) , for quasars and supermassive black holes ( e.g. , romero et al .",
    "2000 , caproni & abraham 2002 ) , for cvs ( barrett et al . 1988 , patterson et al .",
    "1993 , harvey et al .",
    "1995 ) , to name a few .",
    "katz ( 1973 ) suggests that the permanently tilted edge of a disk precesses due to the tidal field of the secondary .",
    "roberts ( 1974 ) suggests that the secondary precesses due to the tidal field of the primary and the tilted disk retrogradely precesses as a consequence .",
    "barrett et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and kondo et al .",
    "( 1983 ) suggest that particles may be orbiting a tilted disk and as a result , the disk retrograde precesses .",
    "patterson et al . ( 1993 ) notice a near 2:1 ratio of the negative - to - positive precessional periods of several cv systems that exhibit both modulations in their light curves , and they note that this ratio is curiously similar to that of the earth which has a retrograde nodding precessional period @xmath0=18.61 yr and a prograde precessional period @xmath1=8.85 yr ( see e.g. , stacy 1977 ) .",
    "patterson et al . ( 1993 ) suggest that the source to retrograde precession in these cv dn systems may be the same as that which causes the earth to retrogradely precess .",
    "petterson ( 1977 ) suggests that the earth s retrograde precession is caused by outside forces , namely tidal torques on the earth s bulge by the moon and sun with the moon having the most effect due to its closer proximity to earth .",
    "hence , patterson et al . (",
    "1993 ) suggests that a tidal torque by the secondary on a tilted accretion disk could be the source to retrograde precession in cv dn non - magnetic , accreting disks .",
    "others have found that only portions of their disk retrogradely precesses . for semidetached binaries , bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show that a one - armed spiral shock wave can be generated in inner annuli of cooler disks ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) .",
    "they find that their inner annuli spiral wave precesses retrogradely , but the disk does not .",
    "based on their numerical simulations , they show that the wave is generated by sheared elliptical orbits .",
    "they suggest that the sheared elliptical orbits are due to retrograde precession within the disk , and the retrograde precession is due to an influence by the mass - losing star by the processes discussed in kumar ( 1986 ) and warner ( 1995 , 2003 )",
    ". however , this suggestion can not be correct because kumar ( 1986 ) finds that retrograde precession is due to the tidal influence of the secondary on a tilted disk s outer annulus , not inner annulus , and because the simulations by bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) do not have warped or tilted disks ( private communication ) .    in this work , we test the idea of patterson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) on the tilted accretion .",
    "we assume the disk is fully tilted out of the orbital plane because our previous works ( wood , montgomery , & simpson 2000 ; montgomery 2004 , montgomery 2009 ) are successful in showing that fully tilted disks retrogradely precess . in addition , our works also generate negative superhump modulations in our artificial light curves that have the correct shape and negative superhump periods of the right percentage as compared with observations . in this work",
    "we do not explain how accretion disks tilt but instead check to see if the source to retrograde precession is like that which causes the spinning , tilted earth to retrogradely precess . in  2 of this paper ,",
    "we develop a generic theoretical expression to describe retrograde precession using the earth - moon - sun system as a model . in  3 , we reduce the generic theoretical expression by considering the geometry of the system and by making appropriate assumptions , thereby obtaining expressions generated or used by others to describe retrograde precession in protoplanetary , protostellar , x - ray , black hole , and non - magnetic accreting cv binary systems . in  4 ,",
    "we summarize our numerical simulations . in  5 , we list observational data .",
    "is  6 , we compare retrograde precessional values obtained from our theoretical expressions with those obtained from our numerical simulations and with those obtained from observational data . in  7 , we provide a discussion and in  8 , we summarize , conclude , and list future work .",
    "we consider two systems , one being the earth - moon - sun system and one being a non - magnetic , accreting cv dn system where the accretion disk is misaligned with the orbital plane . in the earth - moon - sun system ,",
    "the spinning earth is known to have an oblate spheroidal shape .",
    "the resultant equatorial bulge is not symmetric about earth s rotation axis . as such , a net torque on this equatorial bulge results in the rotational axis of the earth precessing in the opposite sense to the earth s spin and earth s orbital directions .    to simplify the many - body problem of the earth - moon - sun system and to generate like coordinates among the two systems , we only consider net torque effects by the sun on the earth .",
    "figure 1 , top panel , exaggerates the earth and sun size and distance scales to show details . in this panel ,",
    "the sun is the small sphere on the @xmath3 axis located at a distance @xmath4 from the origin .",
    "the earth is the large oblate spheroid that is centered at the origin in the ( @xmath5 ) coordinate system of the ecliptic .",
    "the @xmath6 axis defines the normal to the ecliptic and orbital motion @xmath7 is prograde .",
    "the ( @xmath8 ) coordinate system ( @xmath9 not shown ) is the equatorial system of the earth .",
    "earth rotates around the @xmath10 axis with angular velocity @xmath11 .",
    "as shown , the angle from the @xmath6 to the @xmath10 axes is the obliquity @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 share the same axes and thus they coincide with the line of equinoxes at this instant in time in the earth - sun system ( or with the line of nodes in the non - magnetic , accreting cv dn system ) .",
    "also note that @xmath10 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 are in the same plane and thus eulerean rotation is about the @xmath15 axis .",
    "because the gravitational attraction forces differ from a point on earth nearer to the sun , denoted by the force vector @xmath16 , than a point on earth further from the sun , denoted by the force vector @xmath17 , torques around the origin result .",
    "figure 1 , bottom panel , represents the cv dn system and is similar to figure 1a except that the oblate spheroidal earth is replaced with a massive primary star @xmath18 that has angular velocity @xmath19 and that is surrounded by a disk of mass @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "also , the sun is replaced with a secondary star of mass @xmath22 . in this non - magnetic cv dn system ,",
    "the massive primary can not be seen as it is smaller in size compared to the disk size .",
    "we assume that the separation @xmath4 of the system is much larger than the thickness of the disk , and we assume that the disk has negligible mass compared to that of the primary . like the top panel ,",
    "this bottom panel is not to scale .",
    "ultimately we seek the retrograde precession of the line of nodes in the spinning , tilted cv dn system .",
    "to find this precession , we use the precession of the equinoxes in the earth - sun system as a model .      for continuous bodies ,",
    "its angular momentum vector @xmath23 is related to its angular velocity vector @xmath24 in any coordinate system through a linear transformation matrix known as the moment of inertia tensor @xmath25 , @xmath26 using a right - hand coordinate system whose general coordinates are ( x,y,z ) , we can identify the diagonal elements of the matrix as the moment of inertia coefficients and the off - diagonal elements as the products of inertia .",
    "if we assume , for example , that @xmath27 is about the @xmath14 axis and therefore @xmath23 is along the @xmath14 axis , then @xmath28    if the density @xmath29 of a solid is known , then the moment of inertia can be found from @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the perpendicular radial distance from any rotational axis , @xmath32 is small volume element , and density is a function of radius . in cartesian coordinates , the moment of inertia tensor is @xmath33 dv'\\ ] ] where dv=dxdydz. if cylindrical coordinates are desired , then we can integrate from @xmath34 to @xmath35 along the @xmath36 axis where @xmath37 is the height of the cylinder , from @xmath38 to @xmath39 along the @xmath40 axis where @xmath39 is the radius of the cylinder , and from @xmath41 to @xmath42 along the @xmath43 axis .",
    "however , the solution to this integral is most easily found using curvilinear coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 with scale factors @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for a circular cylinder . in this solution , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",

    ", the potential we seek is that of the earth and thus we center this attracting body at the origin of our coordinate system . as shown in figure 2 ,",
    "the attracting body has mass @xmath60 ; an elemental mass @xmath61 is located at a distance @xmath62 from the center of mass of the attracting body and at an angle @xmath63 to the line of centers connecting the center of mass of the attracting body to the center of mass of a far - away point mass object @xmath64 .",
    "we assume in the earth - sun system that the sun is located at a distance @xmath4 where @xmath65 .",
    "the potential @xmath66 at the far away point mass object is    @xmath67    where we have assumed that earth has uniform density @xmath29 and rotation is possible about the line of centers . in this equation , @xmath68 is the universal gravitational constant .",
    "this potential is that of maccullagh , a result that is applicable for slightly non - spherical celestial bodies and for @xmath65 .",
    "this potential is valid for the oblate spheroidal earth in the earth - moon - sun system .",
    "we assume that this potential is also valid for the spinning , tilted cv dn system even though the primary is surrounded by a disk ( and hence the geometry is by far not spherical ) and the radius of the white dwarf primary plus accretion disk is not significantly less than the distance to the point mass secondary star . as the first term in the potential dominates over the other terms ( of which only the second term is shown as all others are assumed negligible ) and as @xmath21 , the potential is most affected by @xmath64 and @xmath69 . as @xmath18 is assumed spherical and of uniform density and as the secondary is significantly further away than compared with the radius of the primary , we accept this potential as valid for the spinning , tilted cv dn system .",
    "we note that the second term in equation ( 4 ) is not negligible as the disk s geometric shape affects the potential via the moment of inertia .",
    "we also note that as the radius of the disk is dependent on the mass ratio of the system , with smaller mass ratios yielding larger disk radii , accretion disks in small mass ratio systems may be subject to additional perturbations .",
    "these additional correction terms are not considered in this work .      in figure 2 ,",
    "the earth in the earth - sun system and the primary in the cv dn system are the attracting mass bodies that are centered at the origin .",
    "the sun and the secondary star are considered to be the far away point mass objects . as the potential is evaluated at the far away point mass object ,",
    "the force , which is proportional to the gradient of the potential , is on the far away point mass object . by",
    "newton s third law , the far away point mass object exerts an equal and opposite force on the attracting body .",
    "as the forces are not co - linear , a torque about the origin arises .",
    "figure 1 is exaggerated to show non - colinear forces .    because the spinning earth has rotational flattening and because the earth s spin axis is tilted , the force pulling on the near - side of earth ( i.e. , the side closer to the sun ) is greater than the force pulling on the far - side of the earth , and a net non - zero torque results about the @xmath13 axis ( see figure 1 , top panel ) . in the spinning ,",
    "tilted cv dn system , a torque about the origin arises for the same reasons - because the disk is tilted and spinning and because this combination results in non - colinear near and far side forces on the disk ( see figure 1 , bottom panel ) . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the body is rotating counter - clockwise about the @xmath10 body axis , and the body moment of inertia coefficients are along the body axes ( @xmath70 ) .    by definition ,",
    "the net torque around the origin of the body is @xmath71 x @xmath72 where any force @xmath73@xmath66 ) .",
    "as @xmath74 x @xmath74 = 0 , then the @xmath75 in equation ( 4 ) is the only term that is not just a function of radius but also a function of ( x,y,z ) .",
    "therefore , we reduce equation ( 4 ) to @xmath76 where we have evaluated the potential at a distance @xmath77 from the origin .",
    "the net torque in the ( @xmath8 ) coordinate system is @xmath78 by employing transformation equations ( see e.g. , goldstein 1980 ) , we can rotate the net torque from the ( @xmath8 ) coordinate system to that of the ( @xmath5 ) coordinate system ( see figure 1 ) . in this transformation , we assume that the obliquity angle @xmath12 remains constant , the orbit is circular , and the mean orbital motion is @xmath79 as shown in figure 1 .",

    "therefore , @xmath85 and @xmath86 is zero .",
    "we can not simplify @xmath87 any further but we we can substitute the identity @xmath88 into @xmath89 . because the magnitude of this torque is not constant , we need to take averages . for example , the magnitude is a minimum at either of the equinoxes and a maximum at either of the solstices in the earth - sun system .",
    "likewise , the magnitude is a minimum when the primary , secondary , and the disk s line of nodes align and a maximum when the primary , secondary , and disk s line of antinodes align .",

    "the direction of the trace is retrograde to the direction of the spin of the body and orbit as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the angular speed of the trace is the magnitude of the precessional angular velocity .",
    "thus , to find the retrograde precession we need to find the time rate of change of the angular momentum and equate that to the torque found in equation ( 14 ) .    to establish the total angular momentum ,",

    "the source to disk tilt in non - magnetic systems remains unknown , and we leave this as future work . as figure 5 shows , a fully tilted disk may look like a disk warp as the system retrogradely precesses . in figure 5 , we only show one half of the total disk precessional period .      in montgomery ( 2009 ) , we find that if the entire disk is tilted , then the gas stream can overflow a disk face and reach inner annuli . as the secondary orbits , the gas stream flows over one face of the disk for @xmath2471/2 an orbit and the flows over the other face of the disk for @xmath2471/2 an orbit .",
    "the location where the gas stream transitions on the disk rim from flowing over to under and vice versa ( i.e. , the nodes ) precesses in the retrograde direction . like the slow westward movement of the first point of aries along the equator of the earth",
    ", the line of nodes also has a slow westward movement along the rim of the disk .",
    "if the disk precesses as a unit and the line of nodes shifts westward by a small amount each orbit , then the location where the gas stream strikes the innermost annuli must also shift westward by a small amount each orbit .",
    "that is , the spinning , tilted ring formed near the innermost annuli of the disk and formed by the gas stream overflowing the tilted disk also precesses in the retrograde direction .",
    "therefore , to explain precession in our numerical simulations , we net the retrograde precession of the tilted , rotating ring and the tilted , rotating disk .",
    "bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) finds that only their spiral density wave retrogradely precesses , not the entire numerical simulated cv accretion disk .",
    "observations by patterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) do not indicate that disks precess differentially .",
    "numerical simulations by murray ( 1998 ) do not indicate that disks precess differentially .",
    "our results do not indicate that disks precess differentially .",
    "papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) analytically show , and larwood et al .",
    "( 1996 ) numerically verify , that rigid body precession of a keplerian disk is possible so long as the sound crossing time scale in the disk is small compared to the precession time scale of the disk .",
    "we find in montgomery ( 2009 ) that the entire disk needs to tilt for additional particle migration to reach inner annuli and produce negative superhumps .",
    "we find in this work that both outer and inner annuli precess in fully tilted disks .",
    "these results suggest that partially retrogradely precessing non - magnetic cv dn tilted accretion disks are unlikely .",
    "driven precession involves torques on a body .",
    "one example is a wobbling coin on a table .",
    "the coin spin rate is slow but its wobble rate is fast due to a torque on the body .",
    "another example is a spinning top inclined at an angle from the vertical .",
    "the spin rate is fast but the precession rate is slow due to torques on the body .",
    "the precession of the earth due to tidal torques by the moon and the sun is another example of a slow precession rate compared to earth s ( relatively ) fast spin rate . for a cv dn system with @xmath186 , we previously calculated the retrograde precessional period to be approximately 80 hours . this period is slow compared to the primary s rotation period of around one hundred seconds , if we assume that the primary s rotation period is similar to that at the disk edge .",
    "therefore , driven precession could be a viable source of retrograde precession in cv dn systems that show negative superhumps in their light curves .",
    "katz ( 1973 ) , roberts ( 1974 ) , katz et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , kondo et al . ( 1983 ) , kumar ( 1986 , 1989 ) , barrett et al . ( 1988 ) , warner ( 1995 , 2003 ) are all examples of those employing or assuming torques to induce retrograde precession .",
    "as we show in figure 4 , retrograde precession in cv dn disks is likely due to the same source that causes the earth to retrogradely precess , that is , by tidal torques .",
    "the difference in precessional values of the earths equinoxes and a cv dn s line of nodes is due to the geometric shape of the precessing object ( e.g. , oblate spheroid , disk , etc . ) , the state of matter ( i.e. , fluid , solid , etc . ) , and any effects due to the accretion stream .",
    "bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) generate a spiral density wave in innermost annuli of their numerical simulated cv disks .",
    "their spiral density wave is caused by sheared elliptical inner disk annuli .",
    "they find that only the spiral density wave retrogradely precesses , and they cite kumar ( 1986 ) as the source to retrograde precession .",
    "however kumar ( 1986 ) finds the retrograde precession due to a tilted disk s outer annuli and thus can not be the source to retrograde precession of the spiral density wave .",
    "however , we may be able to help bisikalo et al .",
    "lubow & shu ( 1975 ) find that pressure can be generated in the disk due to shocks that are induced by gas stream overflow , and lubow ( 1991a , b ) finds that additional pressure due to spiral density waves could cause the disk to retrogradely precess .",
    "if the inner disk has a spiral density wave instead of a dense ring , then the net retrograde precession can still be explained by the solid line in figure 4 .",
    "that is , the disk would retrogradely precess due to combined effects due to tidal torques and pressure from a spiral density wave located near the innermost disk annuli ( instead of a ring ) .",
    "we plan to show this in a future work .",
    "negative superhumps are found in observational systems with high mass ratios , long orbital periods , and high mass transfer rates . in montgomery ( 2009 ) , we find that the negative superhump can be due to extra light being emitted from inner disk annuli .",
    "the extra light is modulated by gas stream overflow that strikes inner disk annuli and by particle migration as the secondary orbits . for this result to be true",
    ", we find in montgomery ( 2009 ) that the disk must be fully tilted .",
    "the source to disk tilt has not yet been resolved and we leave this as future work . fully tilted disks could be subject to driven torques that cause the disk to retrogradely precess .",
    "patterson et al . ( 1993 ) suggest that the retrograde precesison in cv dn accretion disks may be by the same source that causes the earth to retrogradely precess .",
    "using the earth - moon - sun system as a model , we generate a generic theoretical expression for a spinning disk that is misaligned with the orbital plane to test this idea .",
    "we assume the potential of maccullogh is valid for our spining , tilted disk that contains a massive primary that is smaller than the thickness of the disk and the distance to the secondary .",
    "our expression matches that which describes the precession of earths equinoxes .    by making appropriate assumptions ,",
    "we reduce our generic expression for retrograde precession to those generated by others , or to those used by others , to describe retrograde precession in protostellar , protoplanetary , x - ray binary , non - magnetic accreting cv dn , quasar and black hole systems . because our generic expression reduces to those generated by others for a variety of systems , retrograde precession by tidal torques on a spinning , misaligned",
    "primary may be ubiquitous .",
    "previous expressions treated the disk or ring as rigid and/or did nt include the effects on the disk by the accretion stream .",
    "because the disk is fully tilted , the gas stream overflows one face of the disk and particles migrate to inner annuli , creating a spinning , tilted ring that is denser than its surroundings as shown in our numerical simulations .    in this work",
    ", we generate a theoretical expression for the retrograde precession of a spinning , tilted ring .",
    "we assume that the rotation rate of the primary matches that of the inner rim of the spinning , tilted ring .",
    "this implies that the axes of the ring and the primary align .",
    "we show that the net retrograde precession in cv dn non - magnetic accretion disks needs to include the effects due to both the precessing disk and the precessing ring .",
    "if we include the net moment of inertia due to the disk and the ring , then our theoretical expression agrees well with our numerical results .",
    "our findings support the suggestion by patterson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) that tidal torques like those by the moon and the sun on the spinning , tilted earth are the source to retrograde precession in spinning , tilted cv dn accretion disks .    in our theoretical expression and our numerical simulations ,",
    "we assume an average primary mass @xmath248 that matches the average primary mass @xmath241 found by smith & dhillon ( 1998 ) .",
    "if the results in smith & dhillon ( 1998 ) and this work are correct , then from figure 4 we find that v1193 ori and hs 1813 + 6122 secondaries may have stellar masses .",
    "the scatter in observational precessional values seems to be mostly from differing geometrical disk shapes .",
    "the scatter could also be from any density waves that may be present in the disk .",
    "bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) finds that a spiral density wave is generated in innermost annuli of their numerically simulated cv accretion disks .",
    "they find that their spiral density wave retrogradely precesses .",
    "pressure effects generated within the disk from a spiral density wave could add to retrograde precession .",
    "the disk could retrogradely precess due to combined effects due to tidal torques and pressure from a spiral density wave .",
    "we plan to show this in a future work , and we anticipate that the result is the same solid line shown in figure 4 .",
    "however , unlike that found by bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we expect the disk to still precess as a unit .",
    "we do note that we did not consider significant mass loss of the secondary over time and this may also affect precessional values",
    ". if the mass lost by the secondary is not significantly acquired by the primary and is instead mostly lost via e.g. , winds , jets , or circumbinary disks , then the geometric shape of the disk , moment of inertia , mass ratio , and/or orbital period changes and thus so changes the precessional values .",
    "whether the retrograde precession and orbital period values change one - to - one is not fully understood and we leave this as future work as well .",
    "the author would like to acknowledge an aas small research grant and a ucf - uf space research initiative that enabled us to generate this work on our eight - node server .",
    "we would like to thank undergraduate mark guasch for colorizing the disks for this work and undergraduate jon edmiston for finding the elements of the moment of inertia tensor for a rigid elliptical disk .",
    "we thank graham wynn and luigi stella , the reviewer and scientific editor for apj , respectively , as their comments enabled a manuscript that flowed better than the original version .",

    "<S> net tidal torque by the secondary on a misaligned accretion disk , like the net tidal torque by the moon and the sun on the equatorial bulge of the spinning and tilted earth , is suggested by others to be a source to retrograde precession in non - magnetic , accreting cataclysmic variable ( cv ) dwarf novae systems that show negative superhumps in their light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this idea in this work .    </S>",
    "<S> we generate a generic theoretical expression for retrograde precession in spinning disks that are misaligned with the orbital plane . </S>",
    "<S> our generic theoretical expression matches that which describes the retrograde precession of earths equinoxes . by making appropriate assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> we reduce our generic theoretical expression to those generated by others , or to those used by others , to describe retrograde precession in protostellar , protoplanetary , x - ray binary , non - magnetic cv dn , quasar and black hole systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that spinning , tilted cv dn systems can not be described by a precessing ring or by a precessing rigid disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find that differential rotation and effects on the disk by the accretion stream must be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that the best description of a retrogradely precessing spinning , tilted , cv dn accretion disk is a differentially rotating , tilted disk with an attached rotating , tilted ring located near the innermost disk annuli . in agreement with observations and numerical simulations by others </S>",
    "<S> , we find that our numerically simulated cv dn accretion disks retrogradely precess as a unit . </S>",
    "<S> our final , reduced expression for retrograde precession agrees well with our numerical simulation results and with selective observational systems that seem to have main sequence secondaries .    </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that a major source to retrograde precession is tidal torques like that by the moon and the sun on the earth . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , these tidal torques should be common to a variety of systems where one member is spinning and tilted , regardless if accretion disks are present or not . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the accretion disk s geometric shape directly affects the disk s precession rate . </S>"
