    ", subsequent generations are connected to this initial core which results in a tree - like structure @xcite .",
    "today it is well - understood that dendrimers composed of flexible units adopt a so - called dense core structure , that is , the average segmental density has its maximum at the center of the molecule @xcite .",
    "this is easily derived from the fact that flexible dendrimers can assume a great number of conformations in which the terminal groups can fold back .",
    "hence these flexible dendrimers do not exhibit a well - defined surface given by the terminal groups of the last generation .",
    "the average density profile thus derived can be used to calculate the interaction of flexible dendrimers in solution .",
    "thus these structure are well - understood by now @xcite .",
    "much less attention has been paid to dendrimers consisting of rigid units @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig0 ] ( a ) shows the chemical structure of such a rigid dendrimer which is solely composed of stiff units @xcite . while the dendritic scaffold of flexible dendrimers in solution can adopt a large number of conformations which follow from rotations about various bonds , dendrimers consisting of such rigid units exhibit a rather well defined structure in solution .",
    "this fact has been shown recently by small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) @xcite .",
    "hence , these systems may serve as model systems for interacting _ monodisperse _ particles in statistical physics .    here",
    "we present a comprehensive discussion of the interaction of rigid dendrimers in solution .",
    "two systems involving rigid dendrimers are examined in the present paper , namely polyphenylene dendrimers of the fourth generation in solution ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ( a ) ) and stilbenoid dendrimers of the third generation in solution ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the problem to be addressed is that of structural properties over a range of dendrimer concentrations . in general",
    ", the effect of mutual interaction of dissolved species with number density @xmath0 in a scattering experiment can be embodied in the structure factor @xmath1 defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scattering intensity of the single particle , @xmath4 the volume of the particle , @xmath5 the form factor ( normalized to unity for @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is the magnitude of the scattering vector ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 : wavelength of radiation , @xmath10 : scattering angle ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the contrast of the solute resulting from the difference of the average scattering length density and the scattering length density of the solvent . up to now",
    ", mutual interaction has only been addressed because scattering experiments require finite concentrations in order to obtain data with a reasonable statistics @xcite .",
    "hence , the effect of mutual interaction of the dissolved dendrimers has only been considered when extrapolating the data to vanishing concentrations .",
    "details of such a data evaluation may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we determine the correlation functions and structure factors @xmath1 within the framework of an interaction site model and compare these results to experimental data @xcite .",
    "moreover , the validity of the predictions of both scaled particle theory and fundamental measure theory are investigated .",
    "a systematic comparison is made between the results of the theories and experimental data for two differently shaped dendrimers in solution , in order to quantify the influence of the shape of the particles on the quality of the predictions of the theories .",
    "we demonstrate that rigid dendrimers present a new class of strictly monodisperse model colloids whose interaction can be conveniently studied in solution . in this way",
    "we show that these systems allow us to re - consider the basic statistical mechanics of rigid objects in solution and to compare theory and experiment for the first time in a rigorous fashion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly recapitulate the analytical models necessary to calculate the scattering intensity for a system of interacting rigid bodies .",
    "thereafter the theory will be compared to experimental results obtained for the rigid dendrimers shown in figs .",

    "the systems under investigation are solutions . however ,",
    "in view of the mesoscopic scale of the particles , the solvent will be considered as a structureless continuum .",
    "spatial pair correlations of an isotropic fluid of identical particles , each carrying @xmath12 distinct interaction sites , are characterized by a set of intermolecular site - site total correlation functions @xmath13 , where the indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 run over sites on each of two particles and @xmath16 is the particle number density .",
    "these functions are related to a set of intermolecular site - site direct correlation functions @xmath17 by the generalized ornstein - zernike relations of the  reference interaction site model  ( rism ) , which in fourier space read @xcite @xmath18 where the @xmath19 are the fourier transforms of the intramolecular correlation functions .",
    "the set of generalized ornstein - zernike equations must be supplemented by a set of closure relations .",
    "if the interaction sites are simply the centers of exclusion spheres of diameter @xmath20 , to account for steric effects , a convenient closure is the percus - yevick approximation @xcite @xmath21 the experimentally accessible structure factor @xmath1 is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the particle - averaged total correlation function .",
    "the particle - averaged intramolecular correlation function @xmath24 characterizes the geometry of the distribution of the sites , and hence the geometric shape of the particles . while the particle - averaged intramolecular correlation function accounts for the interference of radiation scattered from different parts of the same particle in a scattering experiment , the local order in the fluid is characterized by @xmath25 or @xmath1 .",
    "the rism has been proved to be a successful theory of the pair structure of many molecular fluids ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of macromolecular and colloidal systems , with very large numbers of interaction sites , the number of coupled rism equations becomes intractable , and a considerable simplification follows from the assumption that the direct correlation functions @xmath26 are independent of the indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to the  polymer reference interaction site model  ( prism ) theory first applied by schweizer and curro to long flexible polymers @xcite .",
    "prism neglects end effects in that case .",

    "@xmath29 is independent of the particle number density because the particles are not deformed due to intermolecular interactions for typical concentrations in the fluid state .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the building units of the dendritic scaffold of polyphenylene dendrimers of the fourth generation ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ( a ) ) are rather well - localized and no back folding of the terminal groups occurs @xcite .",
    "a general feature of the polyphenylene building block is its finite angle formed by two subsequent phenyl groups @xcite .",
    "this is due to the strong repulsion between their @xmath31-hydrogen atoms that prevent a co - planar conformation . as a consequence ,",
