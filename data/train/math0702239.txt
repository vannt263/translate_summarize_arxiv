    "by the farkas - minkowski - weyl theorem a convex polyhedron in @xmath0 has two representations .",
    "it can either be described by a finite set of linear inequalities ( facets ) or by a finite set of generators ( vertices and rays ) .",
    "precise definitions are given in section [ sec : basic_notations ] .",
    "one of the most fundamental problems in the theory of polyhedra and its applications , such as combinatorial optimization or computational geometry , is the conversion between two different descriptions .",
    "many algorithms for this representation conversion have been proposed ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for certain classes of polyhedra efficient methods",
    "are known , but there is no approach known which efficiently solves the problem in general .",
    "programs like cdd @xcite , lrs @xcite , pd @xcite , porta @xcite ( or polymake @xcite either relying on some of the others or using its own method closely related to ` cdd ` ) allow conversion of the representation of a polyhedron .",
    "since the programs are implementations of quite different methods , their efficiency may vary tremendously on a given example .",
    "many interesting polyhedra both pose difficulties for the standard representation conversion approaches and have many symmetries that could potentially be exploited . in many applications",
    "it is sufficient ( or at least necessary ) to obtain a list of inequalities or generators up to symmetries . in the present paper",
    "we give a brief survey of approaches that can be used for the representation conversion problem up to symmetries .",
    "we do not discuss their asymptotic complexity ( which , in the worst case , is not encouraging ) , but rather refer to previous papers where the methods have proven themselves on difficult instances that could not otherwise be solved . for the new approach discussed in section [ sec : sym - pivoting ] we provide some experimental data ourselves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : basic_notations ] we give some basic notations and facts from the theory of convex polyhedra . in section [ sec : symmetries ] we consider different notions of symmetries and describe how they can practically be obtained using a graph automorphism computation . in section",
    "[ sec : orbits ] we describe the group theoretical notions used in the representation conversion methods discussed in the remainder of the paper . in section",
    "[ sec : subpolytope ] we consider decomposition methods which reduce the given problem to a number of smaller problems .",
    "these approaches have been used quite successfully by different authors . in section [ sec : cascade ] we describe the incremental _ cascade algorithm _ and in section [ sec : sym - pivoting ] we show how symmetry can be exploited in a simplex pivot based algorithm .",
    "in this section , we give a brief introduction to some basic concepts and terminology of ( convex ) polyhedra . for more details on polyhedra",
    ", we refer to the books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    given the vector space @xmath0 , denote by @xmath1 its dual vector space , i.e.  the vector space of linear functionals on @xmath2 .",
    "a _ convex polyhedron _",
    "@xmath3 can be defined by a finite set of linear inequalities @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "if the number of inequalities @xmath8 in the description is minimum , we speak of a non - redundant description .",
    "the dimension @xmath9 of @xmath10 is the dimension of the smallest affine subspace containing it . under the assumption that @xmath10 is full - dimensional , i.e.  @xmath11",
    ", every inequality @xmath12 of a non - redundant description defines a _ facet _ @xmath13 of @xmath10 , which is a @xmath14-dimensional convex polyhedron contained in the boundary of @xmath10 .    by the farkas - minkowski - weyl theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite , corollary 7.1a ) , @xmath10 can also be described by a finite set of generators : @xmath15 where @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "if the number of generators is minimum , the description is again called _ non - redundant_. in the non - redundant case , the generators @xmath18 , @xmath19 , are called _ vertices _ and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , are the _ extreme rays _ of @xmath10 . in case @xmath10 is bounded we have @xmath22 and we speak of a _",
    "convex polytope_.    the _ representation conversion _ from a minimal set of generators into a minimal set of linear functionals ( or vice versa ) is called the _ dual description problem_. by using homogeneous coordinates , the general inhomogeneous problem stated above can be reduced to the homogeneous one where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for example , we embed @xmath25 in the hyperplane @xmath26 in @xmath27 and consider the closure of its conic hull .",
    "the so - obtained polyhedron @xmath28 , with @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , is referred to as _ polyhedral cone_. by duality , the problem of converting a description by homogeneous inequalities into a description by extreme rays is equivalent to the opposite conversion problem .",
    "so for simplicity we assume from now on that @xmath3 is a _",
    "polyhedral cone _ given by a minimal ( non - redundant ) set of generators ( extreme rays ) .",
    "if @xmath33 we say that @xmath10 is generated by @xmath34 .",
    "we want to find a minimal set @xmath35 with @xmath36 by choosing a suitable projection , it is possible to reduce the problem further to the case where @xmath10 is full - dimensional and does not contain any non - trivial linear subspaces .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 span a @xmath37-dimensional linear subspace , we may just choose ( project onto ) @xmath37 independent coordinates . the appropriate projection ( i.e.   equations of the linearity space ) can be found efficiently via gaussian elimination .",
    "in other words , without loss of generality we may assume the @xmath18 span @xmath0 ( @xmath10 is full - dimensional ) and the linear inequalities @xmath38 span @xmath1 ( @xmath10 is pointed ) .",
    "a _ face _ of @xmath10 is a set @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an element of @xmath41 the polyhedral cone _",
    "dual _ to @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath42 .",
    "the faces of a pointed polyhedral cone are themselves pointed polyhedral cones .",
    "we speak of a @xmath37-face , if its dimension is @xmath37 .",
    "the faces form a ( combinatorial ) lattice ordered by inclusion , the _ face lattice _ of @xmath10 .",
    "the rank of a face in the lattice is given by its dimension .",
    "each face is generated by a subset of the generators of @xmath10 and therefore it is uniquely identified by some subset of @xmath43 . in particular , the @xmath44-dimensional face is identified with the empty set @xmath45 and @xmath10 itself with the full index set @xmath43 .",
    "all other faces of @xmath10 are identified with some strict , non - empty subset @xmath46 .",
    "we write @xmath47 for two faces of @xmath10 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "two @xmath37-faces of @xmath10 are said to be _ adjacent _ , if they contain a common @xmath50-face and are contained in a common @xmath51-face .",
    "in particular , two extreme rays ( @xmath52-faces ) are adjacent , if they generate a common @xmath53-face and two facets are adjacent , if they share a common @xmath54-face ( a _ ridge _ ) . by the properties of a lattice , for two faces @xmath55 and @xmath56 , not necessarily of the same dimension , there is always a unique largest common face @xmath57 contained in them , and a unique smallest face @xmath58 , containing both .",
    "any sub - lattice @xmath59 $ ] of the face lattice consisting of all faces containing @xmath60 and contained in @xmath58 is known to be isomorphic to the face lattice of some pointed polyhedral cone of dimension @xmath61 .",
    "note that this is a special feature of face lattices of polyhedra , which is not true for general lattices .",
    "in particular the _ diamond property _ holds for face lattices : every sub - lattice of rank  @xmath53 carries the combinatorics of a @xmath53-dimensional polyhedral cone , namely a face @xmath60 of rank  @xmath62 , a face @xmath58 of rank @xmath63 and two faces @xmath55 and @xmath56 of rank @xmath37 . the rank  @xmath53 sub - lattices are in one - to - one correspondence to pairs of adjacent faces .",
    "a _ polyhedral complex _",
    "@xmath64 is a set of polyhedral cones ( the _ cells _ of @xmath64 ) satisfying the following two properties :    1 .   if @xmath65 then every face of @xmath10 is also in @xmath64 .",
    "2 .   for all @xmath66 , @xmath67 is a face of both @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    the facets of a polyhedral cone",
    "@xmath10 form a polyhedral complex , the _ boundary complex _ of @xmath10 .",
    "polyhedral complex @xmath70 is a _ subdivision _ of polyhedral complex @xmath64 if every cell of @xmath64 is the union of cells in @xmath70 and every cell of @xmath70 is contained in some cell of @xmath64 .",
    "a subdivision is called a _ triangulation _",
    "if every cell is a simplicial cone , i.e.  is the conic hull of exactly @xmath71-extreme rays . by the homogeneous embedding of polytopes",
    "discussed above , we may equally discuss boundary complexes , subdivisions , and triangulations for polytopes .",
    "two faces ( cells ) of a polytopal complex have empty intersection exactly when the corresponding cones intersect only at the origin .",
    "in this paper we are especially interested in the case where some non - trivial group acts on the given polyhedron @xmath10 .",
    "the _ combinatorial automorphism group _ of @xmath10 , generated by @xmath72 extreme rays , is the subgroup of @xmath73 of all permutations ( acting on ray indices @xmath43 ) which preserve the whole face lattice of @xmath10 .",
    "thus the combinatorial automorphism group acts not only on the generating rays , but also on the set of facets ( inequalities ) , and more generally on the sets of faces of a given dimension .",
    "moreover , it preserves the inclusion relation among faces .",
    "it is known that the combinatorial automorphism group of @xmath10 can be computed from the incidence relations between extreme rays and facets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given generators @xmath74 of a polyhedral cone @xmath10 and a subgroup @xmath75 of the combinatorial automorphism group of @xmath10 , we want to obtain the facets of @xmath10 up to symmetry , that is , one representative @xmath46 from each orbit under the action of @xmath75 .    if no group or only a small group is given , we usually still want to exploit as much symmetries of the given polyhedron as possible in the representation conversion .",
    "that is , ideally we would like to compute the full combinatorial automorphism group .",
    "however , we do not know how to compute it without computing the facets , which is precisely the problem we want to solve .",
    "so we have to settle for a compromise and work with a more restricted type of automorphism .",
    "note though , that one may obtain the full combinatorial automorphism group of @xmath10 , after the facets have been computed    in many cases the combinatorial automorphism group ( or some nontrivial subgroup ) may reflect geometric symmetries , for example if it has a representation as a subgroup of @xmath76 acting naturally on @xmath0 and the polyhedral cone @xmath10 .",
    "the group of all matrices in @xmath76 preserving @xmath10 is called _ linear automorphism group _ of @xmath10 .",
    "since a linear automorphism permutes the set of extreme rays @xmath77 , we naturally obtain a representation as a permutation group @xmath78 .",
    "it is important to note here that although the induced permutation group is finite , the linear automorphism group of @xmath10 is not necessarily so , and it can be quite awkward .",
    "think for example of the quadrant in @xmath79 generated by the two non - negative coordinate axes .",
    "the induced permutation group is @xmath80 , its linear automorphism group however is @xmath81    as explained in section [ sec : basic_notations ] we may limit our discussion to the special case of a full - dimensional , pointed polyhedral cone @xmath10 generated by @xmath82 .",
    "the elements @xmath83 of the linear automorphism group of @xmath10 satisfy @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is an induced permutation and @xmath86 .",
    "note , in case @xmath10 is the homogenization of a @xmath14-dimensional polyhedron @xmath87 , the linear automorphism group of @xmath10 corresponds to the so called _ projective automorphism group _ of @xmath87 , that is , the set of all projective maps preserving @xmath87 .",
    "we are not aware of any practical algorithm to compute linear ( or projective ) automorphism groups or to decide if two polyhedral cones are linear ( or projective ) isomorphic .",
    "a _ restricted isomorphism _ of two full - dimensional vector families @xmath88 and @xmath89 in @xmath0 is given by a matrix @xmath90 such that there exists a permutation @xmath91 satisfying @xmath92 for @xmath93 . a _",
    "restricted automorphism _ of a vector family is a restricted isomorphism of @xmath94 with itself .",
    "we speak of a restricted isomorphism between two polyhedral cones generated by the two vector families @xmath94 and @xmath95 , if it is a restricted isomorphism between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "note though that the definition of restricted isomorphisms for polyhedral cones depends strongly on the choice of generators .",
    "since such generators are only unique up to any positive factor , the choice of generators is very crucial . in practice",
    "the situation is usually not so bad as there is often a natural choice for the generators .",
    "the big advantage of restricted isomorphisms is that we can compute them by obtaining the graph isomorphisms for an edge colored graph . given a vector family @xmath96 spanning @xmath0 we define the positive definite matrix @xmath97 let the graph @xmath98 be the complete graph with vertices @xmath18 and edge colours @xmath99 . then the following holds :    [ prop : isomorphism - equivalence ] let @xmath100 be two finite vector families .",
    "then every isomorphism of the edge coloured graphs @xmath98 and @xmath101 yields a restricted isomorphism of @xmath94 and @xmath95 and vice versa .",
    "in practice the popular and very nice program nauty @xcite by mckay can be used to check for graph isomorphisms or compute the group of automorphisms .",
    "note however , that the current version only takes vertex coloured graphs as input .",
    "we therefore have to transform our edge coloured graph to a somewhat larger vertex coloured graph that preserves the automorphism group ( see for example @xcite ,  p.25 ) .",
    "let @xmath102 be the matrix obtained from @xmath94 .",
    "denote by @xmath103 the unique square root of @xmath104 , that is , the positive definite @xmath105 matrix @xmath103 with @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 for @xmath17 .",
    "then the edge colours @xmath108 of the graph @xmath98 are exactly the inner products @xmath109 of the transformed vectors @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in the same way we obtain @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath95 .",
    "now let @xmath83 be a restricted isomorphism for @xmath94 and @xmath95 with associated permutation @xmath85 .",
    "then we have @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , the matrix @xmath116 is orthogonal and satisfies @xmath117 .",
    "this implies @xmath118 , i.e.  the restricted isomorphism of the vector families @xmath94 and @xmath95 corresponds to an isomorphism between the edge coloured graphs @xmath98 and @xmath101 .",
    "suppose on the other hand @xmath119 be an isomorphism between the edge coloured graphs @xmath98 and @xmath101 . by reordering elements",
    ", we may simply assume @xmath120 .",
    "instead of looking for a solution of @xmath121 we consider the equivalent equations @xmath122 .",
    "since the @xmath18 generate @xmath0 , we find a basis @xmath123 of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath124 , respectively @xmath125 is the @xmath105 matrix formed by @xmath126 , respectively @xmath127 , then the matrix equation @xmath128 takes the form @xmath129 .",
    "so , the matrix @xmath130 is orthogonal and we have for any @xmath131 and @xmath132 : @xmath133 this yields @xmath134 and since the @xmath114 form a basis of @xmath0 the relation @xmath135 are implied .",
    "thus we obtain a restricted isomorphism between @xmath94 and  @xmath95 .",
    "in order to generate facets ( or more generally faces ) of a polyhedron up to symmetries , it is necessary to deal with orbits of faces . in this section",
    "we briefly indicate what the basic tasks are that we have to accomplish and how these can be approached .    as before",
    ", we assume that a polyhedral cone @xmath10 is given by a set of generators @xmath74 which define the extreme rays of @xmath10 .",
    "each face is represented by a subset of @xmath136 which corresponds to the indices of generators incident to the face .",
    "we assume @xmath78 is some subgroup of the combinatorial automorphism group of @xmath10 , hence a permutation group acting not only on the set of indices @xmath136 ( respectively rays ) , but also on the whole face lattice of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the dimension of a face and inclusion between faces are preserved by every group element .    in the most general form ,",
    "the problem we have to solve is the following : given two subgroups @xmath137 and @xmath138 of @xmath73 and a list @xmath139 of @xmath137-inequivalent faces , we need to be able to obtain a list @xmath140 of @xmath138-inequivalent faces .",
    "for example , if @xmath141 is trivial , the list @xmath142 simply is a list of pairwise unequal faces and we may obtain @xmath140 by testing for @xmath138-equivalence : starting with @xmath143 and then subsequently adding @xmath144 for @xmath145 to @xmath140 , if it is not @xmath138-equivalent to any element in @xmath140 . clearly , this _ orbit fusion _ can be applied whenever @xmath146 .    in case @xmath147 it is necessary to `` break some symmetry '' and _ split ( factorize ) orbits_. this can be done with the _",
    "double coset decomposition _",
    ", described in section [ sec : canonical - rep ] .",
    "note , if neither @xmath146 nor @xmath147 , one could in principle convert the @xmath137-orbits into @xmath138-orbits in two steps , by either using the intersection group @xmath148 or the group @xmath149 generated by @xmath137 and @xmath138 and obtaining @xmath75-orbits in an intermediate step .",
    "orbit fusing and splitting is a typical and essential task when generating discrete structures up to isomorphism ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a common task is to decide whether or not two faces are @xmath75-equivalent , that is , whether or not the corresponding subsets of @xmath136 lie in the same orbit under the action of @xmath75 .",
    "the dimension of a face ( rank in the face lattice ) and its cardinality are quickly testable invariants .",
    "other invariants can easily be obtained , for example by looking at the action of @xmath75 on pairs , triples , or other @xmath37-tuples of indices ( generators ) , respectively on lower dimensional faces .",
    "the number of elements from each such orbit included in a face is a @xmath75-invariant .",
    "unfortunately , there is no clear rule how many such sets have to be chosen , so one has to rely on heuristics .",
    "if we only consider restricted isomorphisms , metric invariants can be used as well , for example the set of pairwise inner products between generators , discussed further in section  [ sec : metric - invariants ] .    when all invariants are satisfied , then group computations must be done . for small groups",
    "it is possible to simply generate the whole orbit of a face .",
    "if the size of available memory is a problem , we may just keep a _",
    "canonical representative _ for the orbit , for example the lexicographical minimum ( when viewed as a subset of @xmath136 ) . these can be found for example by a backtrack method ( see section  [ sec : implementing_orbits ] ) .",
    "assume @xmath150 and that a list of @xmath137-orbits is given . in order to obtain a list of @xmath138-orbits , we may split each orbit @xmath151 , with a representative face @xmath60 , by the well known _",
    "double coset decomposition _",
    "for example in @xcite and @xcite ) : the group @xmath137 can be decomposed into _ double cosets _",
    "@xmath152 where @xmath153 are elements of @xmath137",
    ". then the orbit @xmath151 is decomposed into @xmath154 hence into @xmath155 orbits @xmath156 with @xmath157 .",
    "note that the more straightforward algorithm of generating the full orbit or of computing a decomposition of @xmath137 into cosets @xmath158 is slower and/or requires more memory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental data structures used to work with permutation groups are _ bases and strong generating sets _ ( bsgs ) ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) . based on them a backtrack search on cosets of a point stabilizer chain can be used to obtain canonical representatives , to decide on ( non-)equivalence as well as to obtain stabilizers of subsets of @xmath136 ( faces ) .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an elaborate version is the _ partition backtrack _ introduced by leon @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are known to work quite well in practice , although from a complexity point of view the problems are known to be difficult .",
    "that is , there is no ( worst - case ) polynomial time algorithm known to solve these problems .",
    "even worse , it is somewhat unlikely that there exist polynomial time algorithms , since the _ graph isomorphism problem _ , not known to be in @xmath159 , is reducible to them in polynomial time ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the computer algebra system gap @xcite provides functions for generation of full orbits ( orbit ) stabilizer computations ( stabilizer ) and equivalence tests ( representativeaction ) .    in the case where we have special knowledge of the group @xmath75 or its representation",
    ", it might be much easier to obtain canonical representatives or to compute stabilizers of faces .",
    "for example , we may have a situation where the symmetric group @xmath73 acts on @xmath72 elements ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "another example where the action of the symmetric group is used is described in @xcite ( see @xcite for corresponding computer code ) . typically , polyhedra arising in combinatorial optimization are convex hulls of @xmath160-vectors , where each coordinate ( variable ) represents an edge of a complete directed or undirected graph with @xmath72 vertices on which @xmath73 acts . in @xcite a method for obtaining canonical representatives in this situation is described .",
    "in this section we describe two methods which reduce the facet generation problem under symmetries to a number of smaller instances of facet generation problems .",
    "in contrast to the original problem , solving the smaller problems ( for sub - cones ) may be feasible for available software , such as cdd or lrs .",
    "these techniques have been proven to be successful in practice , in cases where standard approaches failed .",
    "we mainly distinguish two approaches , the _ incidence decomposition method _",
    "( see section [ sec : incident ] ) and the _ adjacency decomposition method _ ( see section [ sec : adjacency ] ) .",
    "both methods are reasonably natural and have been used separately by different authors .",
    "the incidence decomposition method reduces the problem of facet generation to a number of smaller problems , in which we generate facets that are incident to some extreme rays . as before let @xmath10 be a polyhedral cone in @xmath0 , generated by @xmath161 .",
    "assume @xmath78 is some permutation group acting on the face lattice of @xmath10 .",
    "the set of extreme rays ( indices ) falls into orbits under the action of @xmath75 . for each orbit",
    "we consider a representative @xmath162 ( index @xmath12 ) and generate a list of @xmath75-inequivalent facets of @xmath10 incident to it .",
    "then , in a post - processing step the lists of facets obtained in this way are merged to a list of @xmath75-inequivalent facets of @xmath10 ( see section [ sec : orbits ] ) . since every @xmath75-orbit of facets of @xmath10 contains a facet which is incident to one of the chosen representatives , the resulting list is complete",

    "a nice feature of the adjacency decomposition method is that the adjacencies of the most symmetric facets , which are usually the most difficult to treat , may not have to be considered .",
    "this is due to the well known _",
    "balinksi s theoreom _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , theorem 3.14 ) :    [ balinski](@xcite ) let @xmath10 be a @xmath71-dimensional , pointed polyhedral cone .",

    "two vertices @xmath205 are connected by an edge @xmath206 if @xmath207 .",
    "then , the graph @xmath75 is @xmath208-connected , i.e.  removal of any @xmath209 vertices leaves it connected .    using balinski s theorem",
    ", we know that if the number of facets in unfinished orbits ( i.e.  those whose neighbors are not known ) is less than @xmath179 , then any @xmath75-inequivalent facet in the unfinished set must be adjacent to some already completely treated facet .",
    "this simple criterion has proven  @xcite , @xcite to be extremely useful in dealing with examples arising in the geometry of numbers .      both , the incidence decomposition method and the adjacency decomposition method reduce the facet enumeration problem for a @xmath71-dimensional polyhedral cone @xmath10 to a number of facet enumeration problems for cones in dimension @xmath179",
    ". these lower dimensional problems may be too difficult to treat with a standard method as well and therefore we might apply the incidence or adjacency decomposition method to these lower dimensional problems recursively .",
    "so we may speak of the _ recursive incidence decomposition method _ , the _ recursive adjacency decomposition method _ and the _ recursive decomposition method _",
    ", if a mixture of both is applied .",
    "the recursive incidence decomposition method has successfully been used for computing the vertices of the metric polytope @xmath210 in @xcite , whereas the recursive adjacency decomposition method has successfully been used in @xcite and @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , and to our surprise , a recursive mixture of both has not been used so far .",
    "the crucial steps for the recursion are `` @xmath211 '' ( where @xmath155 is some extreme ray ) for the incidence method ( see section [ sec : incident ] ) and `` @xmath212 '' ( where @xmath60 is some facet ) for the adjacency decomposition method ( see section [ sec : adjacency ] ) . in both cases the problem is to obtain a list of facets for a @xmath14-dimensional polyhedral cone @xmath60 , whose extreme rays are given .",
    "again we can exploit symmetries . as a result of a call of the incidence or adjacency decomposition method for @xmath60",
    ", we obtain a list of @xmath213-inequivalent facets of @xmath60 ( ridges of @xmath10 ) , where @xmath213 is some group acting on the face lattice of @xmath60 which we have to provide . in a post processing step",
    "we then have to obtain a list of @xmath214-inequivalent ( respectively @xmath215-inequivalent ) facets of @xmath60 ( ridges of @xmath10 ) out of it .",
    "note though , that the groups @xmath213 and @xmath216 may be unrelated , that is , the elements of @xmath213 do not have to be elements of @xmath216 and vice versa .",
    "think of examples where @xmath10 is a polyhedral cone without any symmetries , but with a facet having some symmetries .",
    "vice versa , since we did not assume that @xmath213 is the full ( combinatorial ) symmetry group , not even the stabilizer @xmath217 of @xmath60 in @xmath214 has to be a subgroup of @xmath213 . in the latter case we may simply replace @xmath213 by the group generated by @xmath217 and @xmath213 , so that we assume @xmath218 .",
    "in this way we possibly enlarge the group and speed up the computations .",
    "moreover , we are able to use the double coset decomposition ( see section [ sec : double - cosets ] ) to split each @xmath213-orbit @xmath219 of facets of @xmath60 into a finite number of @xmath215-orbits @xmath220 , where the @xmath221 represent the double cosets .",
    "using the described decomposition methods recursively it might happen that we compute the facets of some sub - cones several times .",
    "for example if a face @xmath60 satisfies @xmath222 for a facet @xmath55 of a polyhedral cone @xmath10 , then there is exactly one other facet @xmath56 such that @xmath223 .",
    "hence , if we apply the adjacency decomposition method to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then we have to compute the dual description of @xmath60 two times . clearly , the number of such repetitions increases as the recursion depth increases .",
    "moreover , equivalent sub - cones may occur in different parts of the face lattice .",
    "( recall that any sub - lattice of the face lattice is the face lattice of some polyhedral cone . ) to handle this , we propose to use a _ banking system_. that is , given a difficult sub - cone @xmath10 of which the facets have been computed up to symmetries , we store with @xmath10 ( represented by generators ) its group of restricted automorphisms and a representative for each facet orbit .    what about the recursion depth needed to practically solve a given polyhedral conversion problem ? if we split the problem into subproblems with either decomposition method then some of the subproblems may be easy to solve and may not require a recursive treatment , others might be impossible to treat without such . the implementation  @xcite allows one to provide a heuristic function to choose whether to recursively apply the adjacency decomposition method , but in choosing the right level of recursion requires some trial and error . from our computational experience with this code ( for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the _ incidence number _ of a face ,",
    "that is , the number of extreme rays contained in it , gives a good measure for how difficult the representation conversion is for it .",
    "we therefore propose to treat the faces with low incidence numbers first and as much as possible without recursion . for subproblems to be potentially solved with pivoting methods ( possibly up to symmetry as below ) , the `` probing feature '' of lrs",
    "can be used to test for expected difficulties of a subproblem .    finally , let us remark , that parallelization is a possible way to speed up the ( recursive ) decomposition methods as well ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly sketch here the _ cascade algorithm _ by jaquet @xcite , which is a symmetry exploiting version of _ fourier  motzkin elimination_. for this observe first that a @xmath71-dimensional polyhedral cone @xmath10 generated by @xmath82 can be obtained as the projection of an @xmath72-dimensional polyhedral cone with @xmath72 linear independent generators @xmath224 . without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath225 is a basis of @xmath0 .",
    "we set @xmath226 for @xmath227 and @xmath228 for @xmath229 .",
    "let @xmath230 be the orthogonal projection of @xmath231 onto @xmath232 .",
    "then for the cone @xmath233 we have @xmath234 .",
    "the cone @xmath87 is simplicial , since the family @xmath235 is a basis of @xmath231 .",
    "take the @xmath72-dimensional polyhedral cone @xmath87 and the projection @xmath236 of @xmath231 on a @xmath237-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "the facets of the projection @xmath238 are either projections of facets of @xmath87 or projections of intersections of facets of @xmath87 . in the fourier ",
    "motzkin elimination we first compute the facets of @xmath87 and then successively obtain the facets of @xmath239 from one of these two cases .",
    "note , since @xmath87 is a simplex , the facets of @xmath87 are simply given by the @xmath237-subsets of extreme rays of @xmath87 .    in the cascade algorithm",
    "we also consider symmetries in each step : if @xmath75 is a group of symmetries of the polyhedral cone @xmath10 , then the induced symmetry group on @xmath240 is the stabilizer of the set of vertices @xmath241 under @xmath75 , which we denote by @xmath242 .",
    "so , in order to compute the orbits of facets of @xmath240 under @xmath242 we need to compute the orbits of facets and ridges of @xmath243 , first under @xmath244 and then under @xmath245 using the double coset method .",
    "it is well known that the fourier ",
    "motzkin method depends in a critical way on the ordering of generators @xmath193 of @xmath10 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the cascade algorithm introduces another such dependency as the size of the set - stabilizers vary enormously according to the chosen ordering . among the many possible orders of the generators , it is not clear which ordering is best .    in practice fourier ",
    "motzkin elimination suffers from generating many redundant inequalities .",
    "this problem can be eliminated by using the related _",
    "double description method _  @xcite . for a description of how to use the double description method to perform the fourier ",
    "motzkin projection steps without introducing redundant inequalities , see  @xcite , section  4.1 .",
    "since for certain classes of input , the most successful methods for the polyhedral representation transformation problem ( without taking symmetries into account ) are based on the pivot operation of the simplex method , it is natural to consider whether pivoting techniques can be adapted to the symmetric setting .      for the purposes of this discussion , by _ @xmath37-basis _",
    ", we mean a set of @xmath37 extreme rays generating the linear span of a @xmath37-face of a pointed polyhedral cone .",
    "two @xmath37-bases are _ adjacent _ if they share @xmath62 extreme rays .",
    "when @xmath37 is not specified , we refer to @xmath14-bases of a @xmath71-dimensional polyhedral cone .",
    "note that the bases of a polyhedral cone depend not only on the combinatorial information contained in the face lattice , but also on the linear dependencies among extreme rays incident to a given face .",
    "when discussing @xmath14-dimensional polytopes or their @xmath71-dimensional homogenizations , we use basis to refer interchangeably to a @xmath14-basis of the homogeneous cone or a @xmath54-basis of the polytope ( i.e. , @xmath179 vertices spanning a facet of the polytope ) .",
    "the _ basis graph _ has as nodes the bases , and as edges the pairs of adjacent bases . in the",
    "so - called _ non - degenerate _ case each facet of a @xmath71-dimensional cone is a @xmath14-dimensional simplicial cone . by a perturbation argument , for any cone there exists a triangulation of the boundary which is combinatorially equivalent to the boundary of a polyhedral cone with simplicial facets ; it follows by balinski s theorem that the basis graph is at least @xmath14-connected .",
    "one of the earliest published methods of polyhedral representation transformation  @xcite is based on an exhaustive exploration of the basis graph . using the pivot operation of the simplex method",
    ", adjacent @xmath14-bases can be found in time proportional to the number of input generators and the dimension ( for details , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "pivoting methods based on reverse search  @xcite have memory usage independent of the output size . in the present work we consider only more direct methods based on generation ( and storage ) of the basis graph up to symmetry .",
    "in the typical case , generating the entire basis graph is impractical , even if it is not stored .",
    "this is because of the enormous number of bases that correspond to each facet in the degenerate ( i.e.non-simplicial facet ) case . in the non - symmetric",
    "setting , perturbation has been widely used to reduce the size of the basis graph under consideration , in particular via the lexicographic ( symbolic ) perturbation discussed further in section  [ sec : symbolic ] .",
    "we consider one way in which perturbation can be applied in the symmetric case in section  [ sec : orb - perturb ] .",
    "there is some tension between the notions of symmetry and perturbation though : whereas perturbation allows us to reduce the size of the basis graph , usually some of the given symmetries are lost .",
    "so there is a tradeoff in which ideally the quotient graph of the obtained new basis graph with respect to its remaining symmetries is as small as possible .",
    "the performance of pivoting based methods under symmetry is determined not by the total size of the basis graph , but by the number of orbits of bases .",
    "this number is not determined by the number of orbits of extreme rays and the number of orbits of facets .",
    "we define the _ basis automorphism group _ to be the subgroup of the combinatorial automorphism group that acts on the basis graph . to see that this is a non - trivial restriction , consider the cone generated by the following ( row ) vectors in @xmath246 @xmath247 combinatorially ,",
    "it is ( the homogenization of ) a pyramid over an octahedron , and its combinatorial automorphism group is the @xmath248 element octahedral group .",
    "the basis automorphism group has only @xmath249 elements ; in particular the orbit of the first @xmath71 generators ( as a basis ) is of size @xmath52 .",
    "[ ex : crosspolytope ] the regular @xmath71-cross polytope @xmath250 has one orbit of @xmath71-bases and one orbit of @xmath14-bases with respect to its automorphism group",
    ".    since the @xmath71-cross polytope is simplicial , ( i.e. , its facets are all simplices ) its @xmath14-bases are exactly its facets .",
    "observe that at most one pair of vertices in a @xmath71-basis must consist of an opposite pair @xmath251 , since any two pairs are co - planar .",
    "it thus follows from the pigeonhole principle that a @xmath71-basis consists of a facet , along with one vertex not on that facet .",
    "all such simplices are equivalent under the automorphism group of the cross polytope .    for a slightly more involved example , let @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "the _ wreath product _ of @xmath10 with @xmath254 is defined as @xmath255    so loosely speaking , the wreath product of @xmath10 and @xmath254 is obtained by attaching to the vertices of @xmath254 pairwise orthogonal subspaces , each containing a copy of @xmath10 .",
    "the wreath product @xmath256 of a regular @xmath71-cross polytope @xmath10 with a regular @xmath257-cross polytope @xmath254 has dimension @xmath258 , @xmath259 vertices , @xmath260 facets and one orbit of vertices , facets , and @xmath261-bases with respect to its linear automorphism group .",

    "we consider @xmath94 here as a matrix ( with @xmath18 as rows ) , and let @xmath342 denote the column vector of corresponding @xmath343st coordinates in @xmath95 . following the conventions of section  [ sec : basic_notations ] , we suppose @xmath344 is @xmath52 if @xmath345 is a vertex , and @xmath44 if it is an extreme ray .",
    "we consider the polyhedron @xmath346 @xmath347 the polyhedron @xmath346 may be thought of as @xmath348 intersected with the hyperplane @xmath26 . by duality , to find the generators of @xmath346 is equivalent to finding the facets of @xmath10 .",

    "it follows that @xmath350 is a fixed point of @xmath349 .",
    "applying proposition  [ prop : fixedpoint ] to our dual representation , we see that orbitwise perturbing the right - hand side vector according @xmath351 will preserve the symmetries of @xmath188 .",
    "the perturbed system thus has the form @xmath352 where @xmath353 for @xmath354 and @xmath336 is the index of the orbit containing @xmath18 . to ensure an orbitwise lexicographic perturbation",
    ", we will insist @xmath355 where by @xmath356 we mean that @xmath332 is much smaller than @xmath330 , i.e.  it is not possible to combinatorially change the polyhedron defined by by choosing @xmath357 smaller . to implement this symbolically , we need a modification of the standard lexicographic pivot rule ( see  @xcite or  @xcite for more details ) .",

    "pivot_. we start by choosing a column index @xmath336 to leave @xmath365 . to find a column index to replace @xmath336",
    ", we need to find @xmath367 where @xmath368 and @xmath369 . in our case ,",
    "where @xmath370 , we may decompose @xmath371 , and thus the ratio test into two parts @xmath372 and @xmath373 . because the values of the @xmath374 are chosen very small ,",
    "the second part is considered only to break ties .",
    "we write @xmath375 where column @xmath336 of @xmath376 is defined by summing the columns of @xmath377 corresponding to orbit @xmath336 of generators , and multiplying by @xmath378 . because of the ordering , in order to evaluate @xmath379 we proceed column by column in @xmath376 , reducing the set of ties at each iteration .        consider facets @xmath380 and @xmath55 that are equivalent under some symmetry of the basis automorphism group . this same symmetry acts as an isomorphism between the corresponding basis graphs .",
    "it follows that when we discover a basis @xmath381 defining a new orbit , but the facet @xmath60 spanned by @xmath381 is known , we do not need to explore the neighbours of @xmath381 since they will be explored in our canonical ( i.e.  discovered first ) facet in the orbit of @xmath60 . in order to ensure orbits",
    "are not discarded , we are careful not to mark @xmath381 as known until its canonical discovery .",
    "although this pruning does not reduce the number of orbits of bases explored , it can reduce the number of actual bases visited ( and tested for isomorphism ) , since bases of a given orbit are not revisited in every copy of the facet @xmath60 . as an example , consider the @xmath277 quadrilateral facets illustrated in figure  [ fig : rotate ] , with rotational symmetry yielding @xmath382 orbits of bases .",

    "basis @xmath383 has vertices @xmath384 around the boundary of the facet.,height=144 ]    without pruning , a depth first search visits all of the bases ; with pruning only @xmath385 of @xmath386 bases are visited ( see figure  [ fig : prune ] ) .",
    "the speedup obtained depends roughly on the number of facets visited by the unpruned search , which is bounded by the number of basis orbits .",
    "c@c    &      in the case where our symmetry group preserves the inner product between pairs of vectors , as is the case for the restricted automorphisms discussed in this paper , we may take advantage of this in several ways .    for any face or basis @xmath387 to be tested for isomorphism , we may construct a graph ( analogous to that constructed in proposition [ prop : isomorphism - equivalence ] ) whose nodes are the vectors of @xmath387 and whose edges are the angles between them .",
    "this graph contains geometric information not present in the index sets representing @xmath387 , which can help to speed up an algorithm to find an isomorphism . a simpler observation , and equally widely applicable , is that the set of pairwise inner products of two isomorphic faces or bases must be equal .",
    "this allows us to store orbit representatives in a data structure such as a hash table or a balanced tree , with the key to the data structure being the set of inner products .",
    "this permits more efficient isometry testing by retrieving exactly those orbit representatives which pass the inner product invariant .",
    "it is computationally easy to test whether a given linear transformation @xmath388 is in the restricted automorphism group @xmath389 of vector family @xmath94 .",
    "since we are interested in restricted automorphisms carrying basis @xmath387 to basis y , we can additionally test if @xmath390 for some @xmath391 ( where @xmath392 can be computed by the same techniques as proposition  [ prop : isomorphism - equivalence ] ) .",
    "we have only implemented an exhaustive search of @xmath392 , and this is naturally only effective when @xmath392 is quite small . in principle",
    "it should be possible to integrate the test for @xmath388 being a restricted isomorphism into a backtracking procedure to search for @xmath393 .",
    "much as in the case of polyhedral representation conversion without symmetries , a certain amount of trial and error seems to be necessary to decide on the the best method to attack a given conversion problem up to symmetries .",
    "currently decomposition methods have the best record of solving interesting problems ; on the other hand current software requires a certain amount of user intervention in the form of choosing how to treat subproblems .",
    "it would be helpful to automate this process . in this context",
    ", a virtue of the pivoting methods is that good methods to estimate their running time exist  @xcite .",
    "it would be beneficial , not just when working with symmetry , to have effective methods ( or at least heuristics ) for estimating the running time of incremental methods .",
