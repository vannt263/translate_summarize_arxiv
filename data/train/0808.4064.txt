    "accreting black hole binaries radiate most of their energy in the x - ray bandpass , and the wealth of recent x - ray data means that their spectral behaviour in this energy range is well characterized . at high accretion rates ( typically more than a few per cent of the eddington luminosity ) the accretion flow is dominated by an optically thick and geometrically thin disc , extending to the last stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "this disc emits most of its power at @xmath01 kev ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , though it is always accompanied by a soft tail of emission to higher energies .",
    "by contrast , at lower luminosities the spectrum is dominated by a hard tail , usually attributed to comptonization of soft seed photons in hot , optically thin plasma , peaking at @xmath0100 kev .",
    "this soft - hard spectral transition indicates a change in the nature and geometry of the accretion flow , most plausibly due to the inner disc being evaporated into a radiatively inefficient flow ( see e.g. the reviews by mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "strong evidence for this picture comes from the recent _ swift _ monitoring campaign on the outburst of the low mass x - ray binary xte j1817330 ( rykoff et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter r07 ) , where the low energy bandpass of the ccd detector gives for the first time a direct detection of the disc during the soft to hard transition and in the hard state ( r07 , gierliski , done & page 2008 , hereafter gdp08 ) . while the derived inner disc radius is strongly model dependent in the hard state ( simple fits indicate that the disc is not truncated while more complex models require a truncated disc : r07 and gdp08 ) , all models give a larger inner radius in the transition spectra than in the soft state ( r07 , gdp08 ) , as expected if a receding inner disc triggers the soft - hard transition ( gdp08 ) .",
    "studies of the corresponding radio behaviour tie the jet firmly into the accretion flow .",
    "the hard state has a steady jet whose radio power increases with the x - ray luminosity of the flow .",
    "this emission is suppressed in the soft , disc dominated state , but there can be strong radio flaring during rapid transitions from the hard to soft states .",
    "this is probably due to faster ejected material ( perhaps the remains of the jet supporting , large scale height plasma from the low / hard state ) catching up with the slower , steady jet from lower luminosity states , giving rise to strong shock acceleration ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; done et al . 2007 ) .",
    "by contrast with this wealth of data in the x - ray and radio bandpass , the optical is surprisingly poorly studied .",
    "there is a broad consensus that the reprocessing of the soft x - ray emission from the outer disc should dominate the optical emission in the soft state ( e.g. van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ; vrtilek et al .",
    "1990 ; esin et al .",
    "2000 ; hynes et al . 2002 ; 2005 ) , but low / hard state is much less clear .",
    "there can still be an important contribution to the optical emission from reprocessed x - ray illumination of the outer disc ( e.g. esin et al . 2000 ) but the emission from the jet can also be important , as can the companion star ( e.g. russell et al .",
    "disentangling these in an individual spectrum is not easy , but these models predict a different optical to x  ray luminosity ratio , @xmath1 , from a series of spectra at different mass accretion rates .",
    "theoretical models of the optical emission from irradiation and from the jet predict @xmath2 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) and @xmath3 ( russell et al .",
    "2006 ) , respectively .",
    "however , observations of a sample of low mass x - ray binaries ( where the companion star should make negligible contribution to the optical emission except in quiescence ) in the hard state shows @xmath4 law , roughly consistent with either disc reprocessing or the jet ( russell et al .",
    "studies of the correlated x - ray / optical rapid ( subsecond ) variability seem to give a much better distinction between jet and disc models , since the disc reprocessing model gives a clear prediction that the optical light curve is a lagged and smeared version of the x - ray light curve .",
    "the lack of smearing of the lagged optical variability in the few cases where this has been attempted gives clear evidence for a jet contribution ( malzac et al .",
    "2004 ; gandhi et al .",
    "2008 ) .    here",
    "we revisit the problem of disentangling the origin of the uv / optical emission from snapshot spectra .",
    "we again use the _ swift _ data from the outburst of xte j1817330 ( r07 ; gdp08 ) but this time focus on the simultaneous optical / uv photometry which accompanies each x - ray ccd spectrum .",
    "r07 showed that the uv flux tracks the square root of the 210  kev x - ray flux in all the data , and interpreted this as evidence for a reprocessing origin in both the soft and hard states .",
    "we build a simple physical model of reprocessing in the outer disc , and confirm the conclusion of r07 that this produces the optical / uv flux .",
    "however , we also show that simple flux - flux correlations mask a clear increase in fraction of bolometric flux which is required to be reprocessed and thermalized into the optical / uv as the source enters the hard state .",
    "while this could signal a switch to the jet dominating the optical / uv flux , we also show that this is also consistent with the same constant illuminating geometry as inferred for the soft state as the reflection albedo will change markedly for the changing spectral shape .",
    "however , it does also seem likely that there is a small jet contribution as well , since this is required by weak cross - correlation signal between the rapid optical and x - ray variability in a similarly bright hard state of gx339 - 4 ( gandhi et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we caution that the flux correlations resulting from reprocessing are not simple .",
    "more sophisticated physical models of x - ray illuminated discs are required in order to clearly predict the expected optical / uv flux from an irradiated disc , including the self - consistent vertical structure of the illuminated disc atmosphere , its reflection albedo and full emission spectrum ( e.g. jiminez - garate et al .",
    "2002 ) . only with such models will snapshot spectra be able to constrain the relative contribution of jet and illuminated disc in the hard state , and be able reliably estimate the solid angle of the directly illuminated outer disc .",
    "we use publicly available _ swift _ data of the 2006 outburst of xte j1817330 .",

    "we use the xspec model redden to account for uv absorption , with fixed @xmath5 = 0.215 mag ( see r07 ) .",
    "the x - ray fits always underpredict the optical / uv flux , and we quantify this by the ratio of the observed to extrapolated flux in the uvw1 filter of the uvot . this ratio is plotted as a function of mjd in fig .",
    "[ fig : excess ] , showing that it remains relatively constant throughout the outburst in the high / soft and transition states ( as defined in gdp08 ) but increases markedly in the low / hard state .",
    "the excess is highly significant irrespective of uncertainties in reddening e.g. in observation 1 the uv excess drops from 5.7 to 1.5 when @xmath5 is changed from 0.215 to 0 mag . in the next section",
    "we build a physical model of the irradiated disc that can fit this observed uv excess .",

    "we concentrate on how this total emission ( irradiated inner disc and compton tail ) can change the temperature structure of the outer disc by irradiation to produce the observed optical / uv emission .",

    "gdp08 considered the effect of irradiation of the disc by the compton tail , with luminosity @xmath12 .",
    "this irradiation will be most concentrated in the overlap region between the disc and hot flow , so given the uncertainties in geometry , gdp08 simply assumed that the irradiating flux was constant between @xmath13 and @xmath14 and zero elsewhere .",

    "the derived disc size in these data is fairly large , and the uvw1 filter used for the correlation is mostly on the irradiation dominated shoulder rather sampling the outer disc rayleigh - jeans tail ( see fig . [",

    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "thus there is a variable bolometric correction for the 210  kev flux even in the soft state spectra .",
    "we show all these effects explicitly by simulating the spectrum of an irradiated disc for typical soft state spectral parameters ( inner and outer radii fixed at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , weak compton tail of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) with fixed @xmath73 ( see table [ tab : thir ] ) .",

    "if we used the full bolometric flux for the correlation , this point should lie on the same line as the soft - state correlation .",

    "we _ strongly _ caution against using optical / uv  x - ray flux - flux correlations as a diagnostic of the origin of the optical flux . the ` reprocessing signature ' of @xmath81 is only very approximate , depending on the size of the disc and the changing bolometric correction from @xmath63 depending on spectral shape ( especially if there are spectral transitions ) .",
    "_ swift _ observations of xte j1817330 during its outburst clearly show that the uv emission is in excess of a simple extrapolation of the standard multicolour blackbody disc fitting the x - ray band ( r07 ) .",

    "the outer disc can be irradiated in two different ways .",
    "firstly , a wind or corona can form above the disc and scatter the central x - rays down . as discussed in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", the fraction @xmath37 of the central luminosity that is reprocessed , thermalized and reemitted as blackbody ( defined by equation [ eq : fout ] ) depends on the fraction which illuminates the disc , @xmath26 , the fraction of this which is absorbed , @xmath82 , and the fraction of this absorbed flux which thermalizes , @xmath83 . in case of the scattering wind / corona",
    "the geometry - dependent factor is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the solid angle of the wind / corona seen by the central source and @xmath86 is the optical depth of the wind / corona along the line of sight from the central source . in case of direct irradiation",
    "the illumination fraction is simply @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the solid angle of the outer disc seen by the central source .",
    "the most intriguing result reported in this paper is constancy of @xmath37 in the soft state .",
    "the disc temperature changes by a factor 3 , the comptonization - to - disc ratio varies by an order of magnitude , the bolometric luminosity changes dramatically , while the reprocessed fraction remains fairly constant at @xmath89 .",
    "this is possible only when the albedo , @xmath29 , the thermalization fraction , @xmath83 , and the illumination fraction , @xmath26 , remain constant throughout the soft state .",
    "the alternative is a fine tuning of the above parameters to maintain a constant @xmath37 .",
    "here we discuss constancy of these three quantities and draw possible physical scenarios for the irradiation of the outer disc in xte j1817330 in the soft spectral state .",
    "x - ray illumination heats the top skin of the disc up to the compton temperature , and this material escapes as a wind if the thermal velocity at this temperature is faster than the escape velocity ( begelman et al . 1983 ) .",
    "simulations show that the column density and solid angle of this wind give @xmath90 ( woods et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , this wind is produced only at large radii , above @xmath91  cm for a @xmath92 black hole , where @xmath93 is the compton temperature in units of @xmath94  k ( begelman et al . 1983 ) .",
    "the compton temperature is about a half of the disc temperature for soft state spectra , so even at the outburst peak with the disc at 0.9  kev this gives @xmath95 . that makes the radius at which the wind can be produced comparable to our estimate of the outer disc radius of @xmath96 cm .",
    "hence , it seems likely that the disc is too small to effectively drive a powerful wind .",
    "instead , an x - ray heated ( static ) corona develops above the disc .",
    "it can still scatter flux down onto the disc and this scattered fraction should still strongly depend on the irradiating flux i.e. be @xmath97 .",
    "fully iterative calculations of the self consistent vertical structure produced by an x - ray illuminated disc are complex ( e.g. jimenez - garate , raymond & liedahl 2002 ) , but this material is observed in the highly inclined neutron star systems ( the accretion disc corona and dipping sources ) . the compilation of dipping sources by daz trigo et al .",

    "the solid angle of this material is probably @xmath100 ( e.g. frank , king & lasota 1987 ) , hence the illumination fraction should be @xmath101 ( 37)@xmath102 . this number can be consistent with the observed @xmath37 , depending on the actual value of @xmath29 and @xmath83 ( see section [ sec : albedo ] ) , but it should _ decrease _ by an order of magnitude as the luminosity declines .",
    "this contradicts the observations .",
    "hence it seems more likely that the disc is directly illuminated , where the constant illumination fraction , @xmath103 , is a natural consequence of a constant disc geometry .",
    "detailed calculations show that the ( steady state ) disc shape is convex , so a pure disc can not self - illuminate ( dubus et al . 1999 ) , but the self - consistent x - ray illuminated disc vertical structure is more complex , and can lead to a thicker disc ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "2002 ; loska , czerny & szczerba 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , the disc can be warped , so that the outer edge is directly illuminated .",
    "such warps are inferred from the long term periods seen in some x - ray binary light curves ( e.g tananbaum et al . 1972 ) and may be produced simply by irradiating the disc ( petterson 1977 ; pringle 1996 ) .",
    "the reflection albedo and fraction of non - reflected flux which can thermalize are both strongly depend on the vertical structure of the disc .",
    "material at the local blackbody temperature is effectively neutral in terms of soft x - ray opacity , so soft x - rays are absorbed rather than reflected .",
    "thus the decreasing disc temperature as the soft state declines predicts a decreasing reflection albedo .",
    "we can estimate the albedo for any of our model spectra by convolving them with the neutral reflection code reflect in xspec .",
    "the range of soft - state spectra used in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] ( i.e. decreasing temperature from 0.9 to 0.3  kev with constant @xmath48 = 0.05 ) give an albedo which decreases from @xmath00.02 to 0.008 .",
    "these albedos are so small that the change in absorbed flux , which is @xmath104 , is negligible .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the reprocessed flux should be a constant fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the strongly increasing opacity at softer x - ray energies seen in neutral material also means that the softest x - rays are absorbed at such small depths in the disc that their luminosity does not thermalize . instead of forming a blackbody spectrum ,",
    "the energy is emitted predominantly as line and recombination continuum above the lyman limit .",
    "thus the reprocessed emission in the optical / uv is only a very small fraction of the total reprocessed flux .",
    "conversely , hard x - rays penetrate deeper down into the disc , and thermalize ( e.g. suleimanov et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the thermalization fraction can be estimated as the fraction of luminosity emitted above 2  kev , @xmath105 .",
    "this factor changes from 0.4 to 0.05 as the soft state temperature changes from 0.9 to 0.3  kev ( the highest and lowest temperature in the soft state models of fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] ) .",
    "thus the combined effect of albedo and thermalization in neutral material means that the reprocessed flux should change by a factor @xmath106 , i.e. by a factor 8 .",
    "our observation of a constant @xmath37 then requires that the illumination fraction , @xmath26 , increases by this amount to offset the changing thermalization fraction !",
    "this seems very contrived .",
    "instead , it seems more likely that the x - ray illumination produces a thin ionized skin over the disc .",
    "this increases its albedo to close to unity in the limit where skin is completely ionized so that only the energy from the very hardest x - rays is not reflected due to compton down - scattering .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened as similarly high albedo is also inferred from the lack of irradiation of the companion star .",
    "this implies that the disc opening angle is at least @xmath107 , so the outer disc solid angle is not negligibly small .",
    "the only way to the explain the observed weak optical emission from reprocessing is if most of the x - rays are reflected ( van paradijs 1983 ; van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "only the highest energy x - rays are absorbed by such a highly reflective disc , and these form only a small fraction of the illuminating flux in the soft state which may remain constant as the soft state declines .",
    "all this flux thermalizes so @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "our value of @xmath73 implies that the disc intercepts a fraction @xmath110 of the total bolometric flux for @xmath111 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "the constant reprocessed fraction , @xmath37 , seen in the soft state is most easily interpreted if the outer disc is directly illuminated and has a constant albedo and thermalization efficiency .",
    "the latter two conditions are probably easier to achieve if the disc has an ionized skin ( self - consistently produced by the illumination : jiminez - garate et al .",
    "if so , the spectral change to the hard state will produce a large change in albedo as the luminosity of the hard state peaks at energies around 100  kev where compton down - scattering means that the energy must be absorbed by the disc .",
    "the minimum albedo for the hard state spectra is around @xmath00.6 even for completely ionized material , thus we expect an apparent increase in reprocessed flux by a factor @xmath06 for a soft state albedo of @xmath00.95 , as observed !",
    "thus it seems most likely that there is no change in reprocessing geometry as the source makes a transition to the hard state , but that there is a change in albedo .",
    "we develop a simple physical model of an x - ray illuminated disc , where some fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( both the disc and comptonized tail ) can illuminate the outer disc .",
    "we assume that such cool material has a reflection albedo which is around @xmath00.3 and that all the non  reflected luminosity can thermalize to the local blackbody temperature . fitting this to the broadband optical / uv / x - ray _ swift _ spectra of the outburst of the black hole binary xte",
    "j1817330 shows that the optical / uv emission in the soft state is consistent with a reprocessing of a constant fraction of the bolometric x - ray luminosity .",
    "this argues against a scattering origin for the illumination , as the optical depth / solid angle of a wind / corona from the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines .",
    "instead it is much more likely that the outer disc is directly illuminated by the central source , and maintains a constant opening angle throughout the soft state .",
    "however , we estimate that for neutral material the reflection albedo should be very small , and the thermalization fraction should change markedly as the soft state declines , requiring a fine tuned increase of the irradiation geometry in order to produce the constant reprocessed fraction .",
    "instead it seems more likely that there is an ionized skin which develops over the disc , giving a much higher reflection albedo and a constant thermalization fraction .",
    "if so , then the change in albedo which results as the source makes the transition to a hard state spectrum can explain the apparent jump in fraction of reprocessed flux at this point with a constant reprocessing geometry .",
    "this would argue against a significant additional contribution from the jet to this hard state optical / uv emission .",
    "these results highlight the additional physical insight which is derived from fitting even simple physical models of an illuminated disc as opposed to flux - flux correlations .",
    "we urge further development of more sophisticated models which properly include the albedo and thermalization effects now that such excellent data are available to constrain the illumination geometry of the outer disc .",
