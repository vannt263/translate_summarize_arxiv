    "in weisskopf et al .  ( 2004 )  hereafter paper i we presented the first _ chandra_-letgs ( low energy transmission grating spectrometer ) phase - averaged and phase - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of the crab pulsar . in that paper",
    "we set an upper limit to the thermal emission from the neutron star s surface , essentially unblemished by any contaminating signal from the pulsar s wind nebula . here",
    "we present the results of new _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations that made use of a high resolution camera ( hrc ) shutter .",
    "the hrc serves as the readout for the letgs . using the shutter ,",
    "together with a factor of two for increased observing time , allows for more high - time resolution data over our previous observation by an order of magnitude and thus more meaningful phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "after briefly describing the observation and data reduction (  [ s : obs ] ) , we discuss the analysis of the measured spectra (  [ s : anares ] ) .",
    "we update the work of paper i regarding the interstellar abundances in the line of sight to the pulsar and other relevant parameters (  [ s : pas ] ) .",
    "we do not repeat the discussion in paper i concerning the impacts on the spectroscopy from using different scattering coefficients and cross - sections , nor do we repeat the comparison of our results with certain other previous measurements .",
    "we present (  [ s : svar ] ) new , more precise , measurements of the variation of the non - thermal spectral parameters with pulse phase and the implications .",
    "we discuss constraints on the surface temperature of the underlying neutron star (  [ s : temp ] ) assuming two different models for the thermal emission and fitting the data as a function of pulse phase allowing the power law component to vary .",
    "this approach yields a less - biased approach to measuring , or setting upper limits to , the thermal spectral parameters .",
    "we discuss ramifications of the temperature measurements (  [ s : imp ] ) and summarize our findings (  [ s : sum ] ) .",
    "in this paper we make use of data ( obsid 9765 ) we obtained in 2008 , january . as with our previous observation ( paper i )",
    "these data were taken using _",
    "s low - energy transmission grating ( letg ) and high - resolution camera spectroscopy detector ( hrc - s )   the letgs . for this observation",
    ", however , we also inserted one of the hrc s shutters to occult most of the positive order , a significant fraction of the zero order , and some of the negative order flux .",
    "this was done deliberately to prevent the total counting rate from exceeding the telemetry limit .",
    "not exceeding the telemetry limit , in turn , allows us to make full use of the hrc time resolution without having to employ the severe filtering described in paper i which dramatically reduced the amount of detected events with time resolution good enough to resolve the light curve of the pulsar .",
    "in addition , and also to keep the telemetry rate low , the two outer hrc - s detectors were turned off .",
    "we processed all data using _ chandra _  x - ray center ( cxc ) tools .",
    "level 2 event files were created using the ciao script hrc_process_events with pixel randomization off and caldb 4.4.1 .",
    "the program axbary was used to covert the time of arrival of events to the solar system s barycenter . using lextrct ( developed by one of us , aft )",
    "we extracted the pulsar s dispersed spectrum from the images .",
    "the extraction used a @xmath3-pixel - wide ( cross - dispersive ) region centered on the pulsar , in 2-pixel ( dispersive ) increments .",
    "this extraction width is the standard extraction region for which the ciao - derived response functions apply for the central hrc - s detector . for the letg s 0.9912-@xmath4",
    "m grating period and 8.638-m rowland - circle radius , the letgs dispersion is 1.148  / mm .",
    "consequently , the spectral resolution of the binned data ( two 6.4294-@xmath4 m hrc - s pixels ) is 0.01476  . because of the occultation of the hrc shutter , we only considered the minus - order dispersed spectrum .",
    "the occultation is a geometrical effect with the shutter occulting progressively less and less of the negative order with the degree of obscuration varying from about 75% at 3.8 kev to only about 10% at 0.3 kev .",
    "the response function is the standard ciao response but applying a correction factor simply determined from the ratio of the minus - order obsid 759 ( paper i ) flux to that seen in the obsid 9765 data to account for the effect of shuttering .",
    "we restricted all data analysis to the ( first - order ) energy range 0.3 to 3.8 kev .",
    "the upper spectral limit avoids contamination from the zeroth - order nebular image ( see fig . 1 in paper i ) ; the lower limit is placed at a level where the first order flux effectively goes to zero .    selecting the appropriate region of the data to be used as",
    "the background estimator requires some care as one must deal with the dispersed flux from the nebula which includes such bright features as the inner ring ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2000 ) . to determine the background we studied the flux at the deepest portion of pulse minimum ( phase range @xmath5 to @xmath6 , fig .",
    "[ f:3 ] ) in the spectral region corresponding to 0.3 to 3.8 kev in first order and projected onto the cross - dispersion axis ( fig .",
    "[ f : back ] ) .",
    "we chose pulse minimum for this study to avoid having the pulsar dominate the projected data .",
    "based on the information shown in fig .",
    "[ f : back ] , and to estimate the background , we extract data from two 15-hrc - pixel - wide bands starting 15 pixels to either side of the pulsar s dispersed image .",
    "note that just beyond ( more negative ) @xmath7 pixels in fig .",
    "[ f : back ] there is a slight rise traceable to the dispersed spectrum of features near the pulsar , showing that extending the background region much wider would be a mistake .",
    "of course the asymmetric nature of the background in the cross - dispersion direction due to features in the nebula makes the selection of regions to either side of the dispersed spectrum a necessity , so that the average provides an accurate background estimate .",
    "as in paper i , whenever we fit data to a particular spectral model we allow for interstellar absorption using cross - sections from vern , verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and interstellar absorption tbvarabs , wilms , allen & mccray ( 2000 , references therein ) , allowing for absorption by interstellar grains .",
    "in addition , owing to the small effective aperture of our observation of the pulsar , we also allow for the effects of diffractive scattering by grains on the interstellar extinction using a formula based on the rayleigh  gans approximation ( van der hulst 1957 ; overbeck 1965 ; hayakawa 1970 ) , valid when the phase shift through a grain diameter is small .",
    "details may be found in paper i. we analyzed the data using the xspec ( v.11.3.2 ) spectral - fitting package ( arnaud 1996 ) . to ensure applicability of the @xmath8 statistic",
    ", we merged spectral bins as needed to obtain at least 100 counts per fitting bin ( before background subtraction ) .",
    "response functions were first generated using the ciao threads mkgarf and mkgrmf and then corrected for the occultation of the shutter blade .",
    "the effective areas were generated using standard ciao tools and caldb 4.4.3      we present here the results of our analysis of the phase - averaged spectrum , although we will not use this spectrum to search for an additional thermal component nor to measure phase - independent parameters .",
    "these tasks are more appropriately accomplished using the phase - resolved spectrum (   [ s : svar ] ) , a point also emphasized by jackson & halpern ( 2005 ) .",
    "fitting the phase - averaged data to a power law spectrum and allowing for interstellar absorption , a variation in the abundance ratio of oxygen to hydrogen , and small - angle scattering by intervening dust give an excellent fit , @xmath8 of @xmath9 for @xmath10 degrees - of - freedom ( @xmath11 ) . the best - fit spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : spectrum ] .    in table",
    "[ t : phavg ] we list the best - fit parameters , but now fix the dust scattering factoring as was done in paper i to make comparisons . as a convenience for the reader ,",
    "the first line in the table repeats the results from paper i. the second line shows how these results change using the more recent response function , background extraction regions , etc .",
    "the reader will note that there are differences between line 1 and 2 of the table that are beginning to approach statistical significance , primarily the change in the hydrogen abundance is lower ( 3.68 as compared to 4.20 ) .",
    "the differences are mostly a consequence of the evolution of the calibration of the letgs effective area .",
    "the differences between the results for the same data ( lines 1 and 2 of table  [ t : phavg ] ) emphasize that we have ignored ( as many x - ray astronomers do ) the possibility that there are any errors in the response functions !",
    "the final comparison is between our current results ( line 3 of table  [ t : phavg ] ) and the updated results for obsid 759 .",
    "as before , there are differences , but none of them at the 3@xmath12 level .",
    "the largest differences , in the normalization and in the powerlaw index may be a reflection of inaccuracies at the 5%-level in our correction to the response function for the insertion of the blade .",

    "the normalization was set assuming a distance to the crab of 2 kpc .",
    "the surface magnetic - field parameter was set at @xmath14 gauss , although results are not terribly sensitive to this choice .",
    "the model also requires the gravitational mass @xmath15 and the circumferential radius @xmath16 of the neutron star .",

    "simulations with fake data have shown this to be correct .",
    "we believe that this happens because the nsa spectrum has a hard tail which makes it difficult to distinguish from the power law .",
    "here we apply cooling theory for neutron stars and formulate constraints on the internal structure of the crab pulsar that can be inferred from the observational upper limits of its effective surface temperature @xmath20 (  [ s : bb ] &  [ s : nsa ] ) .",
    "current cooling theories ( e.g.   page , geppert & weber 2006 , page et al .  2009 , yakovlev & pethick 2004 , yakovlev et al .",
    "2008 ) state that any isolated neutron star of the crab pulsar age ( @xmath21 yr ) should be at the neutrino cooling stage and have an isothermal interior . the preceding cooling stage of internal thermal relaxation , when the neutron star core is noticeably colder than the crust ( because of stronger neutrino cooling of the core and slower thermal conduction in the crust ) , lasts no longer than @xmath22 yrs .",
    "that stage should be over .",
    "the interior of the pulsar then should be highly isothermal having the same internal temperature @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the internal temperature redshifted for a distant observer ( thorne , 1977 ) .",
    "the local ( actual ) temperature @xmath25 in the isothermal interior is @xmath26% higher than @xmath24 , with the stellar core being somewhat hotter than the crust . a noticeable temperature gradient in a thermally relaxed star survives only near the surface , in the outer heat - blanketing envelope ( gudmundsson , pethick & epstein 1983 ) with thickness not higher than a few tens of meters . in the envelope ,",
    "the temperature drops from the temperature inside the star to the effective surface temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the temperature drop depends on the matter composition and on the magnetic field in the envelope ( which affects the thermal conductivity ",
    "see potekhin , chabrier , & yakovlev 1997 , potekhin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the cooling of the crab pulsar ( as of all isolated neutron stars of ages @xmath27 yrs ) is driven by neutrino emission from its interior , mainly from the superdense core .",
    "the decrease of the internal temperature @xmath23 with time is determined by the physics of the core , being insensitive at this cooling stage to the physics of the envelope .",
    "therefore , the internal cooling of a star with a given internal structure is the same for any heat - blanketing envelope ( looks the same from inside ) but the surface temperature is affected by the particular properties of the envelope ( looks different from outside ) .",
    "there are numerous versions of current cooling theories as cited above and they are still poorly constrained by observations .",
    "the theories comprise different compositions and equations of state ( eoss ) of neutron star cores , different neutrino emission properties and models for superfluidity of baryons ( which affect heat capacity and neutrino emission ) . in spite of the large number of scenarios , the cooling of isolated thermally relaxed neutron stars with an isothermal interior is mostly regulated by the three factors",
    "is not observed for a given neutron star , which is so for all currently observed isolated neutron stars except for the star in the cas  a supernova remnant ( heinke & ho 2010 ) . in this case",
    "one can glean more information as to the neutron star structure ( page et al .",
    "2011 , shternin et al .",
    "( e.g. yakovlev et al .",
    "2011 ) : ( i ) the neutrino cooling rate ; ( ii ) the properties of the heat - blanketing envelope ; and ( iii ) the stellar compactness .",
    "the neutrino cooling rate @xmath28 [ k s@xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the neutrino luminosity of the star ( redshifted for a distant observer ) , and @xmath32 is the heat capacity ( see , e.g. eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) in yakovlev et al .",
    "it is instructive ( yakovlev et al .",
    "2011 ) to introduce the normalized cooling rate @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neutrino cooling rate of the _ standard neutrino candle _ , a neutron star with the same @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath24 , but with a non - superfluid nucleon core that is cooling via the ordinary modified urca process of neutrino emission . for isolated neutron stars without any additional internal heat sources ,",
    "physically allowable values of @xmath35 may vary from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( e.g. yakovlev et al .",
    "if @xmath38 this implies standard neutrino cooling , @xmath39 very slow cooling ( e.g.   when the modified urca process is suppressed by superfluidity ) and @xmath40 fast cooling ( accelerated by direct urca processes , pion or kaon condensates , or by neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of neutrons ) .    we have employed the models of heat - blanketing envelopes of potekhin , chabrier , & yakovlev ( 1997 ) and potekhin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which may contain some mass @xmath41 of ( light - element ) accreted matter and have a dipole magnetic field @xmath42 ( with @xmath43  g at the magnetic equator for the crab pulsar ) .",
    "the effective temperature of a magnetized star varies over the surface with the magnetic poles being hotter than the equator .",
    "cooling theory ( e.g. potekhin , chabrier & yakovlev 1997 ) suggests one use the effective temperature averaged over the surface ( it defines the thermal luminosity of the star ) .",
    "the effect of the given magnetic field on the cooling is weak although included in our calculations .",
    "the effect of the envelope on the cooling is regulated then by @xmath41 which varies from @xmath44 for a standard iron envelope to @xmath45 for a fully accreted envelope .",
    "larger @xmath41 are not realistic because light elements transform into heavier ones at the bottom of the envelope through electron capture and nuclear reactions .",
    "the compactness of the star can be characterized by the parameter @xmath46 which is the ratio of the schwarzschild radius to @xmath16 . according to yakovlev et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , one can distinguish not very compact ( @xmath47 ) and very compact ( @xmath48 ) neutron stars .",
    "values @xmath49 are forbidden by the causality principle ( e.g.haensel , potekhin & yakovlev 2007 ) .",
    "thus , for the neutron star in the crab , the cooling is mainly determined by the three parameters , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the majority of realistic models of neutron stars have @xmath51 and we restrict ourselves to these models .",

    "the long - dashed curve is for the same star but with a fully accreted envelope .",
    "the dot - dashed curve corresponds to a star with strong proton superfluidity in the core and an iron heat - blanketing envelope ; the short - dashed curve is for a star with the same core but for a fully accreted envelope ; the dotted curve is for the same core but for a partly accreted envelope with @xmath53 .",
    "( see text for details . ) ]    our new observational upper limits on @xmath20 are high , comparable to the highest surface temperatures which a cooling neutron star can have .",
    "thus these @xmath20 limits allow the crab pulsar to have almost any theoretically possible neutrino cooling rate ( from very fast to very slow ) .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to compare the upper limits on @xmath20 for the crab pulsar with theoretical models of the warmest cooling neutron stars .",
    "this comparison is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] .",
    "the figure shows some theoretical cooling curves ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the data for stars other than the crab are taken from the same references as in shternin et al.(2011 ) .",
    "the cooling curves are calculated for a model of a neutron star whose core consists of nucleons and has the eos of akmal , pandharipande & ravenhall ( 1998 ) ( apr ) .",
    "specifically , we use a version of the apr eos denoted as apr  i in gusakov et al .",
    "the maximum mass of a stable neutron star with this eos is @xmath55 ; the powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission is allowed in stars with @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] we take a star with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 km ) . the upper limit of @xmath52 for the crab pulsar ( @xmath59}=6.30 $ ] ; @xmath60  mk ) is from the blackbody fits at the 3@xmath12 level for this choice of @xmath15 and @xmath16 (   [ s : bb ] ) .",
    "the solid line in fig .  [ fig : ts ] is the basic cooling curve for a non - superfluid apr @xmath61 neutron star with the iron heat blanket ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this star cools via the modified urca process , its @xmath63 , and thus it represents the standard neutrino candle .",
    "its internal temperature at the crab age would be @xmath64  k , with the neutrino cooling rate @xmath65 k  yr@xmath66 .",
    "the basic curve goes below the @xmath52 upper limit for the crab pulsar .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the crab pulsar is the standard neutrino candle is compatible with the given upper limit .",
    "this conclusion can also be made from previous work , e.g. kaminker et al.(2006 ) .",
    "next we consider two cooling regulators  the neutrino emission rate @xmath35 in the stellar core ( to change the internal temperature @xmath24 ) and the amount @xmath41 of light elements in the envelope ( to change @xmath52 for a given @xmath24 ) .",
    "the long - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] shows cooling of the same standard candle but with a fully accreted envelope .",
    "light elements increase the thermal conductivity , make the envelope more heat transparent , and increase @xmath52 ( for a given @xmath24 ) .",
    "the increase is substantial but can not raise the cooling curve above the @xmath52 upper limit for the crab pulsar .",
    "thus , the crab pulsar can well be the standard neutrino candle inside and have a fully - accreted envelope outside .",
    "the pulsar can also be warmed by reducing its neutrino emission below the standard level . the dot - dashed line in fig .  [ fig : ts]shows the cooling of the same star as in the previous paragraph with the iron heat - blanketing envelope , but with strong proton superfluidity in the core .",
    "this superfluidity greatly suppresses the modified urca process of neutrino emission and the bremsstrahlung emission of neutrino pairs in proton - proton and proton - neutron collisions ( and also suppresses proton heat capacity in the core ) . under these conditions",
    ", the star cools via neutrino bremsstrahlung emission in neutron - neutron collisions .",
    "in this scenario , the normalized neutrino cooling rate is small , @xmath67 , and the core warmer .",
    "exact values of the critical temperature for onset of proton superfluidity are unimportant here ; the critical temperature in the core should be higher than a few times of @xmath68  k to establish this very slow cooling regime .",
    "it is thought to be one of the slowest cooling regimes that can be realized in a cooling star ( without additional heat sources ) and it produces stars with the hottest cores .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows that this hottest star has about the same surface temperature as the standard neutrino candle with a fully accreted envelope ; it is not forbidden by our observations .",
    "the short - dashed curve in fig .  [ fig : ts ] displays cooling of the neutron star with the same very slow cooling rate as previously but now with a fully - accreted envelope . with respect to the basic solid cooling curve ,",
    "its surface temperature is increased by two factors : by proton superfluidity in the core ( @xmath67 ) and by accreted matter in the envelope ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the large increase makes the surface exceptionally warm , with @xmath52 higher than the upper limit for the crab pulsar .",
    "our observational upper limit to @xmath52 does restrict this particular model .",
    "thus , if the crab pulsar does have strong proton superfluidity ( @xmath67 ) it can only have a partially accreted envelope , with @xmath70 .",
    "this is demonstrated by the dotted cooling curve calculated for @xmath71 ; it hits the observational @xmath52 limit .",
    "we also considered a sequence of cooling models with progressively weaker proton superfluidity in the crab pulsar core .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 varies then from @xmath72 for strongly superfluid to @xmath73 for a non - superfluid star . at @xmath74",
    "we find @xmath52 lower than the observational upper limit for any @xmath41 .",
    "all these models are therefore allowed by the observations . at lower @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath75 the pulsar surface would be warmer than the observational limit in disagreement with our observations .",
    "our conclusions are fairly independent of neutron star mass .",
    "indeed we have considered a wide range of masses from 1 to 1.8  @xmath17 ( for stars with the apr eos ) .",
    "the cooling curves stay essentially the same , and the observational upper limits do not change much ( figs .",
    "[ f : kt_bbnorm ] &  [ f : kt_nsa ] ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath76 from the blackbody fits for an @xmath77 ( @xmath78 km ) star .",
    "moreover , the cooling curves stay nearly the same for a large variety of eoss of dense nucleon matter .",
    "these include the 9 original versions of the phenomenological pal eos ( prakash , ainsworth & lattimer 1988 ) , as well as 3 other versions of this eos with the symmetry energy of nuclear matter proposed by page & applegate ( 1992 ) ; and the sly eos ( douchin & haensel 2001 ) .",
    "these neutron star models are all not very compact ( @xmath79 ) which justifies our consideration of not very compact stars ( see above ) .",
    "the very weak dependence of the cooling curves on @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the eos for standard candles and for very slowly cooling neutron stars is not new and has been in the literature [ starting from the paper by page & applegate ( 1992 ) ; see , e.g. yakovlev & pethick ( 2004 ) , for references ] .    instead of the 3@xmath12",
    "upper limits of @xmath52 we could also use less conservative 2@xmath12 limits .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath80 ( @xmath81  mk ) , for the @xmath61 neutron star with the apr eos .",
    "in this case we obtain @xmath82 ( very slow or any faster cooling ) for an iron envelope , @xmath83 ( standard or any faster cooling ) for a fully accreted envelope .",
    "also , the upper limits of @xmath52 , inferred from neutron star atmosphere fits (  [ s : nsa ] ) , are higher than for the black - body fits [ e.g.@xmath84 and @xmath85 for the @xmath61 apr star ] ; they would of course be less restrictive .    for completeness",
    "we note that massive neutron stars may become especially compact .",
    "if they were also slow neutrino coolers , their cooling curves would depend on the compactness parameter @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) , and their @xmath52 would noticeably decrease with increasing @xmath50 ( at @xmath48 ) ( yakovlev et al .",
    "such ( less realistic ) models would be less restricted by the observational @xmath52 limits .",
    "let us remark that according to the majority of current theories massive neutron stars cool faster than the standard neutrino candles due to the onset of fast neutrino emission in their cores .",
    "the mass range of stars which demonstrate faster cooling is very uncertain .",
    "our @xmath52 limits do not constrain the parameters of the crab pulsar if it is a rapidly cooling star .",
    "we note that our model for proton superfluidity to suppress the neutrino emission should be considered as an example .",
    "one may use a more general approach ( yakovlev et al .",
    "2011 ) introducing the normalized neutrino emission rate @xmath35 without specifying a physical model of neutrino emission .",
    "the cooling equation contains @xmath35 , and it is @xmath35 that can be constrained from the observations .",
    "thus there could be several physical models of stellar interior which give the same @xmath35 , and the cooling theory itself can not discriminate between them .",
    "the conclusions above follow from cooling calculations already available in the literature ( particularly , from the results of kaminker et al .",
    "we have repeated these calculations drawing special attention to the crab pulsar ; our fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] is similar to the right panel of fig .  2 of kaminker et al .",
    "notice , that our short - dashed curve goes higher than the analogous curve in kaminker et al .",
    "this is both because we assume a fully - accreted heat - blanketing envelope @xmath86 , while kaminker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) took @xmath87 , and because we employ stronger proton superfluidity in the core .",
    "this difference of cooling curves reflects the uncertainty of the present cooling theory but does not affect our principal conclusions .",
    "finally , we emphasize that at the present stage it would be better to use the model - independent formulation of the cooling theory ( yakovlev et al .",
    "2011 ) , introducing @xmath35 instead of employing any specific physical cooling model , especially when interpreting data .",
    "we have obtained new _ chandra _  data of the crab nebula and its pulsar .",
    "the new data were collected in such a manner to prevent telemetry saturation of the letgs and thus enable efficient collection of high - time resolution data from the pulsar .",
    "we have analyzed these data and re - analyzed our previous observation of the phase averaged spectrum to update spectral parameters .",
    "the updated phase - averaged spectral parameters no longer ( paper i ) indicate that the crab line - of - sight is under abundant in oxygen given the abundances and cross - sections employed in the spectral fitting . in all our analyses ,",
    "we have accounted for the contribution of scattering by interstellar dust to the extinction of x rays in an aperture - limited measurement   a consideration ( often ignored ) in spectral analysis of point sources observed with _",
    "s exceptional angular resolution .",
    "here we have measured , for the first time , the magnitude of that extinction in the direction of the crab pulsar .",
    "in addition , we have measured with a high precision the spectrum of the pulsar as a function of pulse phase and at _ all _ pulse phases .",
    "we find highly significant variation of the power law spectral index as a function of phase and have discovered an unusual behavior of the spectral index as the pulse rises out of pulse minimum on its approach towards the peak of the primary pulse .",
    "interestingly , this behavior appears to be connected to a similar feature in the variation of the optical polarization as a function of pulse phase as well as variations of the gamma - ray spectral index . in both slot- and outer - gap models for phase - resolved radiation from the crab ,",
    "the x - ray emission comes from synchrotron radiation of secondary pairs .",
    "the variations in x - ray spectral index are thus mapping the variations in pair spectrum with phase , although neither of these models currently includes the physical elements that produce the observed spectral variations .",
    "therefore , the more accurate measurements presented in this paper will be a challenge to future modeling , and they have the hope of helping us understand the pair cascade processes in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "we have commented on the differences in measured parameters subsequent to analyzing the same data with different releases of the response functions .",
    "our experience emphasizes the importance of accounting for the uncertainties in the response functions when analyzing data .",
    "one might estimate the level of those uncertainties by noting differences in spectral parameters using the old ( paper i ) and new ( this paper ) response functions , however , this might be too extreme as the newer response functions are a product of several proven refinements .",
    "perhaps then these differences can serve as estimators of upper limits to the variations .",
    "we urge the various observatories to provide users with response functions with errors and the tools use them .",
    "finally , we clarify the means by which the observational data as to the thermal emission may be connected to theories of neutron star cooling and neutron star structure .",
    "our principal conclusions , only slightly dependent on the eos of the pulsar core , pulsar mass , and pulsar radius , are :    * our upper limits to the surface temperature @xmath52 of the crab pulsar weakly restrict the normalized neutrino emission rate @xmath35 ( in units of standard candles ) in the pulsar core and the amount of light elements @xmath41 in the heat - blanketing envelope . *",
    "our observations allow the pulsar to have a neutrino emission rate @xmath74 ( 1/6 of the standard neutrino cooling or higher for the fastest cooling ) for any amount of light elements in the blanketing envelope . for lower neutrino emission rates from @xmath88 to @xmath89",
    "( the lowest rate on physical grounds , e.g. due to strong proton superfluidity in the core ) , our observations constrain the pulsar to have only a limited mass of accreted material ( with @xmath70 at @xmath90 ) .",
    "the absence of strong restrictions on the properties of the crab pulsar follow from the current 3@xmath91 upper limit on @xmath52 .",
    "nevertheless , this state of affairs has its own advantage .",
    "there is still a chance that the crab pulsar is _ warm _ , with the surface temperature @xmath52 only slightly below the present upper limit .",
    "while our upper limit is not very restrictive , a _ real measurement _ of the surface temperature just below the present upper limit would be more restrictive , indicating that the crab pulsar is one of the warmest neutron stars .",
    "for instance , if the temperature @xmath92  k ( @xmath93 ) were measured , we would have @xmath94 ( slow cooling ) for an iron envelope , @xmath95 ( ten times faster than the standard cooling ) for a fully accreted envelope , and generally @xmath96 for a partially accreted envelope .",
    "thus we would be able to constrain the neutrino emission rate within two orders of magnitude .",
    "this large uncertainty comes from the unknown mass of the accreted matter .",
    "if @xmath41 were known , @xmath35 would be even better constrained .",
