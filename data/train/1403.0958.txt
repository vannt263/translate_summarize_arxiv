    "observational evidence favoring the disk - wind model includes the relatively high degree of polarization among bal quasars in general and in bal troughs in particular ( e.g. , ogle et al .",

    "have been argued to accrete at particularly high eddington ratios ( e.g. , ganguly et al .",
    "2007 ) , as inferred based on apparent [ o  iii ] weakness ( yuan & wills 2003 ) .",
    "quasars also possessing low - ionization bals ( lobals , in contrast to the more common high - ionization only hibals ) in particular tend toward weak [ o  iii ] and seemingly lack [ ne  v ] ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "after accounting for intrinsic absorption , luo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) estimate that 1740% of bal quasars are still weak , and suggest that weak quasars may more easily launch outflows ( due to reduced overionization ) with potentially large covering factors .",
    "an initial lack of detected bals among radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) was interpreted to indicate that jets and bals were mutually exclusive ( e.g. , stocke et al .",
    "this paradigm was challenged by a series of discoveries of individual bal rlqs ( e.g. , becker et al .",
    "1997 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1998 ; wills et al .  1999 ;",
    "gregg et al .  2000 ) and then undermined by the identification of a population of bal rlqs ( e.g. , becker et al .  2000 , 2001 ; menou et al .  2001 ;",
    "shankar et al .  2008 ) , mostly detected in the vla 1.4  ghz first survey ( becker et al .  1995 ) with systematic optical spectroscopic coverage obtained by the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; white et al .",
    "2000 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "several bal rlqs display radio spectral and/or morphological properties similar to those of compact steep spectrum ( css ) or ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio sources , which are commonly presumed to be young ( e.g. , stawarz et al .",
    "2008 ) , although in general bal rlq radio morphologies do not require youth ( bruni et al .",
    "2013 ) . additionally , dust - reddened quasars ( plausibly newly active ; urrutia et al .  2008 ; glikman et al .",
    "2012 ) appear more likely to host low - ionization bals ( urrutia et al .",
    "2009 ) , suggesting that at least `` lobals '' may be linked to source age rather than inclination .",
    "these observations , in concert with the remaining scarcity of bals within strongly radio - loud and lobe - dominated objects , have revived alternative `` evolutionary '' models ( gregg et al .  2006 ) that associate bals with emerging young quasars clearing their kpc - scale environment through outflows spanning equatorial through polar ( e.g. , zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) latitudes ( though a purely evolutionary model requires fine - tuning to match observations ; shankar et al .",
    "the reality may lie between a stark orientation / evolution dichotomy , with some types of quasars more able to host winds that themselves have a range of covering factors ( richards et al .",
    "2011 ; dipompeo et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) . in any event ,",
    "it is currently unclear whether bals in rlqs have a similar physical origin to those in rqqs , or indeed whether bals in rlqs are even a homogeneous class .",
    "variability studies provide one method of assessing bal structure , and they can potentially constrain the location and dynamics of the uv absorber . in principle , bal variability could be induced through an alteration in the ionization parameter as a result of fluctuations in the incident flux ( e.g. , trevese et al .",
    "2013 ) ; the variability timescale then constrains the absorber density ( netzer et al .",
    "2002 ) and/or distance ( narayanan et al .  2004 ) . however , this is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism for cases in which the c@xmath0iv variability is confined to a restricted velocity segment within the full bal absorption trough , which indeed constitute the majority of observed variability behavior ( e.g. , gibson et al .",
    "2008 ; capellupo et al .",
    "2013 ; see also discussion of saturated c@xmath0iv outflows in the latter ) .",
    "alternatively , depth changes within bal profiles may plausibly arise from dynamical restructuring of the absorber along the line of sight , with the variability timescale providing estimates of crossing speeds and location ( risaliti et al .",
    "2002 ; capellupo et al .",
    "simulations suggest that although the shielding component of the wind can be dynamic ( sim et al .",
    "2012 ; see also observational x - ray results from saez et al .",
    "2012 ) , synthesized absorption profiles are relatively constant at lower velocities whereas variabilty becomes more pronounced at higher velocities , which correspond to well - shielded material streaming to larger distances ( proga et al .",
    "such disk azimuthal asymmetries can potentially link variability , at differing amplitudes , across multiple velocity components ( filiz ak et al .",
    "in general , dynamical wind outflow models can produce extremely complex behavior ( e.g. , giustini & proga 2012 ) .    broad absorption line variability within radio - quiet quasars",
    "has now been characterized through several studies , many of which make use of sdss data for one or more epochs of coverage . bals in rqqs often show minor depth changes within narrow portions of troughs ( barlow 1993 ; lundgren et al .  2007 ; gibson et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ; capellupo et al .  2011 ; hereafter b93 , l07 , g10 , and c11 , respectively ) .",
    "variability is perhaps more common within shallower or higher - velocity bals ( l07 ; c11 ) which are occasionally even observed to disappear completely ( filiz ak et al .",
    "bals of greater equivalent width ( @xmath7 ) tend to show greater absolute changes in @xmath7 , and bals spanning a wider velocity range tend to show variability within a larger absolute subset of velocity bins ( gibson et al .",
    "2008 , their figure 9 and equation 1 , respectively ) . however , the absolute value of the fractional change in @xmath7 is greater in bals of lower @xmath7 ( l07 ) , and similarly within a given velocity segment shallower absorption increases the likelihood of variability ( c11 ) .",
    "acceleration of bals is rarely observed ( e.g. , hall et al .",
    "2007 ; gibson et al .  2008 ) .",
    "changes in velocity width can sometimes transition features out of ( or into ) formal bal classification ( e.g. , rodrguez hidalgo et al .",
    "2013 ; misawa et al .  2005",
    "; see also discussion in gibson et al .",
    "2009a ) , indicative of a connection between narrow - absorption line or mini - bal troughs and the more extreme bals .",
    "while bal variability is not necessarily monotonic , in general bals in rqqs tend to vary more often and more strongly on longer timescales ( gibson et al .",

    "the percentage of rlqs displaying significant bal variability is 21%@xmath437% ( poisson errors ; table  3 and appendix  a ) , lower than is typical for bal rqqs on similar timescales ( e.g. , c11 ) .",
    "it is possible that this comparison could be influenced by systematic differences in how bal variability is measured across different studies ; for example , our approach of locking continuum and emission line fit parameters as well as bal edges between epochs wherever possible may produce lower changes in @xmath7 than would result from completely independent fitting and measurement at each epoch .",
    "an additional point of concern is that our identification of variability is sensitive to noise .",
    "there is an apparent anti - correlation between bal variability and optical magnitude ( at @xmath70 significance ) for the combined rlq and rqq sample .",

    "both bal rlqs and bal rqqs also tend to have larger absolute ( but not fractional ) changes in equivalent width within stronger bals ( figure  11 ) .",

    "correlation tests again provide agreement in identifying a significant if moderate trend for both rlqs and rqqs , again with larger best - fit slopes for rqqs .",
    "note that the mean and median timescales are similar in the two groupings of rlqs split by average bal equivalent width , so we can be confident that this is a distinct trend from the correlation with timescale ( the average equivalent widths are also similar between the rlq groups split by timescale ) .",
    "this is not the case for the rqqs , so here the rlqs provide a cleaner demonstration of the trends ( previously discovered in rqqs ; see @xmath91 ) toward increasing bal variability on longer timescales or ( in an absolute but not fractional sense ) within stronger bals .",

    "the longest separation measurement is plotted with larger symbol size , while for rqqs only the longest separation measurement is plotted for clarity . for both rlqs and rqqs",
    "the velocity width of the varying regions tends to be only a few thousand km  s@xmath11 , as previously found for rqqs by gibson et al .",
    "these and the previous results are consistent with a simple scenario in which component segments within a given bal have a uniform and independent probability to vary , as could arise from moving material at different radial velocities passing transversely through the line of sight .",
    "it would also be of interest to compare and contrast variability within the si@xmath0iv absorption region to that discussed here for c@xmath0iv bals .",
    "unfortunately , our sample is selected in @xmath87 for c@xmath0iv coverage and several of these bal rlqs do not have si@xmath0iv coverage , which makes a robust statistical comparison difficult . in rqqs , si@xmath0iv absorption may be more variable than c@xmath0iv ( capellupo et al .  2012 ; but see also g10 ) and segments at similar velocities may show coordinated variability ( g10 ; capellupo et al .",
    "2012 ) ; a larger sample ( restricted to higher redshifts ) could test whether this also holds for rlqs .",
    "we next investigate continuum variability in bal quasars .",
    "one motivation for considering optical continuum variability is that it could be indicative of direct incident flux altering the absorber ionization state ( e.g. , trevese et al .",
    "2013 ) or covering factor .",
    "however , such potential connections are better explored with euv or x - ray observations ( e.g. , gallagher et al .  2004 ; saez et al .  2012 ; hamann et al .  2013 ) , which directly probe the high - energy radiation relevant to bal shielding and driving .",
    "of greater relevance , a mutual origin of bal outflows and optical emission in the accretion disk might link continuum and absorption line variability ; for example , a particularly inhomogeneous disk in some quasars ( e.g. , speculatively due to near - eddington accretion ) might facilitate the launching of absorbing clumps that are then observable as bals .",
    "optical magnitudes at multiple epochs were obtained from the catalina sky survey ( drake et al .",
    "2009 ) , data release 2 .",
    "these unfiltered ccd measurements of the quasar optical continua are plotted for bal rlqs in figure  13 and for bal rqqs in appendix  b. the magnitudes are screened for outliers using two passes of 3@xmath16 rejection , after which the median magnitude is taken as the baseline brightness ( dashed line in each frame ) .",
    "timescales are converted to rest - frame with mjd 53000 as the fixed zero point ( for reference , the dr2 release date for sdss is 53079 ) .",
    "the plots show a running mean calculated within rest - frame timescale bins of 200  d for bins containing at least 4 valid measurements ( plotted as a solid red line ) .",
    "we quantify optical continuum variability using a structure function , following the general approach of rengstorf et al .",
    "( 2006 ; see also vanden berk et al .  2004 ; di clemente et al .",
    "in addition to comparing optical continuum variability in bal rlqs versus bal rqqs , we wish to test whether optical continuum variability is linked to bal variability .",
    "given the high - cadence but irregular monitoring of the catalina sky survey and the desired application of a uniform procedure for assessing variability within each bal quasar , we choose to bin the @xmath16-clipped magnitudes within intervals of 20 rest - frame days ( here we are only interested in variability on longer timescales ) prior to calculating the structure function .",
    "errors within each bin are estimated including both the provided measurement uncertainties and the empirical scatter and then additionally enhanced by 30% .",
    "this slight initial smoothing and conservative inflation of errors does not impact the relative ranking between individual objects or the bal rlqs versus bal rqqs comparison but may give somewhat lower absolute structure function values than other approaches .",
    "the structure function is then considered for time lags up to 1000 rest - frame days , binned by 100 days .",
    "for each individual quasar , the sum of these 10 measurements ( or weighted for truncated coverage ) is used to quantify optical continuum variability , and these values are listed in figure  13 and appendix  b.    4.2 .",
    "both bal rlqs and rqqs show greater variability on longer timescales , and tend toward similar variability for any given interval . ]",
    "the structure functions for bal rlqs and for bal rqqs averaged across objects ( rather than across raw magnitude measurements ) are given in figure  14 .",
    "the previously known tendency for quasars to display greater variability on longer timescales ( e.g. , above references ) is clearly also present for bal quasars , both rlqs and rqqs .",
    "there does not appear to be a significant difference between bal rlqs and bal rqqs in optical continuum variability ( see figure  14 ; if anything , bal rlqs may be less variable ) .",
    "the mean continuum variability for bal rlqs ( for consistency again filtering out objects with @xmath61   ) is @xmath88 , similar to the value of @xmath89 for bal rqqs .",
    "from 41 bal rlqs , 7 ( 3 ) or 17% ( 7% ) show mild ( strong ) continuum variability ; in comparison , from 85 bal rqqs , 22 ( 7 ) or 26% ( 8% ) show mild ( strong ) continuum variability .",
    "we find no significant correlation between optical continuum and bal variability ( table  6 and figure  15 ) .",
    "several previous studies have identified a tendency for rlqs to be more variable than are rqqs ( e.g. , vanden berk et al .",
    "2004 ; garcia et al .  1999 ; and references therein ) .",
    "we speculate that those samples include a substantial number of rlqs for which the inclination is close to the line of sight ( including blazars ) and that some of the variability in such rlqs may be jet - linked .",
    "the similarity between bal rlqs and bal rqqs might then support some geometric dependence to bal outflows ( i.e. , our rlqs are not viewed down the jet ) .",
    "this is consistent with the intranight optical variability analysis of joshi & chand ( 2013 ) , which found similar low variability in bal rlqs and bal rqqs .",
    "regardless of the underlying physical explanation , the optical continuum results further support that variability in bal rlqs is similar to ( or modestly less than ) that in bal rqqs .",
    "the absolute change and absolute fractional change in equivalent width are plotted versus radio luminosity and radio loudness in figure  16 .",
    "no strong dependencies of bal variability upon radio properties are apparent .",
    "the median and mean values of @xmath2 , or @xmath3 are similar for rlqs split at either @xmath56 or @xmath57 , and ks tests find no significant differences in their distributions ( table  5 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by kendall and spearman correlation tests ( table  6 ) , which show no significant correlation ( probability @xmath90 in all cases ) of @xmath2 or @xmath3 with either @xmath17 or @xmath8 . at most",
    "there is a very slight tendency , not statistically significant , for increased @xmath3 toward higher @xmath8 values .",
    "however , this may be influenced by the relatively large ( within our sample ) @xmath3 values of a few lobe - dominated quasars , for which the @xmath8 values tend to be high ( figure  16 ) and might indeed be somewhat overestimated due to inclusion of lobe emission or intrinsic reddening depressing the optical continuum .",
    "groupings of rlqs divided by @xmath64 or @xmath55 also do not show any significant trends , with the exception of an apparent anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath8 for rlqs with @xmath91    that may again be related to sample inhomogeneity ( in this case , two varying rlqs that have large @xmath64 timescales ) .",
    "it may be noted from figure  16 that the lobe - dominated rlqs tend toward greater fractional variability than the core - dominated rlqs .",
    "indeed , the mean @xmath3 is @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) for lobe - dominated ( core - dominated ) rlqs , and ks tests support marginal ( @xmath94 ) inconsistency .",
    "however , the small number of lobe - dominated bal rlqs in our sample , as well as their generally greater @xmath64 and smaller @xmath55 values ( median 1500  d versus 600  d and 11    versus 20   , respectively ) , indicates additional study is required to confirm these conclusions .",
    "anecdotally , other cases of notable bal variability in lobe - dominated rlqs are known ; for example , hall et al .  (",
    "2011 ) report dramatic variability in the mg  ii and fe  ii absorption features in the lobe - dominated rlq fbqs j1408 + 3054 ( the redshift of @xmath95 precludes optical coverage of the c@xmath0iv region ; this is a `` felobal '' object that shows absorption within lower ionization features , in this case including iron ) .",
    "studies of the radio spectral indices of non - bal and bal rlqs have found that bal rlqs tend to have steeper values of @xmath96 , suggestive of greater inclinations to the line of sight ( dipompeo et al .",
    "2012 ; bruni et al .",
    "this is consistent with a geometrical dependence to bal structure , although it does appear that outflows can exist at equatorial - to - polar latitudes . within our sample , there is no strong dependence between @xmath96 and bal variability in core - dominated bal rlqs ; lobe - dominated rlqs , with generally steep radio spectral indices , may tend toward somewhat greater absorption variability as discussed above .      in a disk - wind scenario , outflows launched from a rotating disk could maintain an approximately keplerian transverse velocity while traveling radially , and consequent changes in the covering factor as clouds move across the ( extended ) source can provide an explanation for the observed minor shifts in depths at constant line - of - sight velocity that characterize bal variability in rqqs ( gibson et al .",
    "2008 ; g10 ; capellupo et al .",
    "if lobe - dominated rlqs , known to be more inclined than core - dominated rlqs , indeed show enhanced bal variability , then ( particularly given the lack of correlation between variability and general radio properties ) this requires some geometrical dependence of the bal outflow structure .",
    "the very presence of bals in flat - spectrum , core - dominated rlqs is likely incompatible with a strictly equatorial outflow , but simulations of line - driven disk winds indicate that material may be ejected at a range of angles relative to the accretion disk ( e.g. , giustini & proga 2012 ) . for the bal rlqs considered here , it appears unnnecessary to invoke an evolutionary phase , in which the quasar is nearly completely enshrouded , to explain the presence of bals .",
    "recall , however , that our sample is composed almost exclusively of hibals , and lobals may have distinct properties ( @xmath91 ; white et al .",
    "2007 ) .     or @xmath8 .",
    "the lobe - dominated rlqs tend to display greater absolute and fractional variability than the core - dominated objects . ]",
    "the lack of any apparent correlation between bal variability and ( core plus lobe ) radio loudness or luminosity would seem to suggest that the strength of the jet does not exercise a controlling influence upon the absorbing outflow . while the scarcity of bal rlqs with both high values of @xmath8 and large c@xmath0iv absorption @xmath7 ( figure  1 ) could indicate a physical connection ( see also shankar et al .",
    "2008 for modeling of the radio - loud and bal fractions ) , it might alternatively be due simply to a low likelihood for any given object to possess , independently , extreme radio and bal properties .",
    "if the jet and wind are not intimately connected in bal rlqs , this provides an interesting contrast with the situation for binaries , for which it is found that the jet - aided development of a radiation - driven wind can remove sufficient material to starve a jet ( e.g. , neilsen & lee 2009 ) , in a feedback cycle between the `` low / hard '' and `` high / soft '' states .",
    "the longer timescales ( scaling with black hole mass ) in quasars , perhaps in concert with a greater influence of the corona upon the accretion structure than operates in binaries , appear to permit dual - mode feedback with both the high - velocity , low - mass jets and the relatively lower - velocity , higher - mass winds ( e.g. , proga et al .",
    "2010 ) capable of significant energy injection into their surroundings . if indeed mechanical power is ejected primarily in the form of jets below @xmath97 and as winds at higher accretion luminosities ( king et al .",
    "2013 ) , rlqs may sit near this boundary .",
    "rlqs also hosting bals might therefore be expected to be particularly efficient at quenching star - formation within their host galaxies .",
    "we have carried out a study of c@xmath0iv bal variability within a representative sample of 46 rlqs , using 78 pairs of spectra collected with rest - frame separations of 806000  d. our primary results are the following :    \\1 .",
    "changes in bal structure are generally either modest or statistically insignificant ; the mean absolute fractional change @xmath3 is @xmath98 , somewhat lower than the @xmath99 found in a matched sample of bal rqqs .",
    "bal variability in rlqs , where observed , typically consists of a slight change in the depth of a portion of the absorption trough , qualitatively similar to bal rqq variability ( see @xmath93.2 , 4.1 , table  5 , appendix  a ) .",
    "bals in rlqs vary more on longer timescales ( as do bals in rqqs ) .",
    "the absolute fractional change in equivalent width is correlated with @xmath64 , and the mean @xmath3 is @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) for @xmath76  d ( @xmath77  d ) ( see @xmath94.1 , table  5 , figure  10 ) .",
    "bals of larger equivalent width tend to show greater absolute ( but not fractional ) changes in equivalent width , for both rlqs and rqqs , perhaps due to their coverage of more discrete velocity segments ( see @xmath94.1 , table  6 , figure  11 ) .",
    "bal rlqs and bal rqqs show similar optical continuum variability patterns ( if anything , bal rlqs are less variable ) and both vary more on longer timescales , in common with non - bal quasars ( see @xmath94.2 , figures  1314 , appendix b ) .",
    "\\5 . radio loudness and luminosity do not influence bal variability .",
    "the mean @xmath2 and @xmath3 values for rlqs divided at @xmath57 or @xmath56 are similar , and neither measure of bal variability is significantly correlated with either @xmath8 or @xmath17 for these bal rlqs ( see @xmath94.3 , table  6 ) .",
    "lobe - dominated rlqs apparently show greater fractional bal variability than do core - dominated rlqs : the mean @xmath3 is @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) for lobe - dominated ( core - dominated ) rlqs .",
    "however , the small number of lobe - dominated bal rlqs in our sample , as well as their generally greater @xmath64 and smaller @xmath55 values here , indicates additional study is warranted to confirm these conclusions ( see @xmath94.3 , figure  16 ) .    in summary ,",
    "bal variability in rlqs appears to occur in a similar manner as in rqqs ( consistent with a common physical mechanism , such as a disk wind ) , but at perhaps weaker amplitude or with lesser frequency .",
    "the lack of dependence upon radio properties suggests that the jet in rlqs does not strongly influence the absorber , while the potential greater variability in lobe - dominated objects supports some geometrical dependence to the outflow structure .",

    "<S> the sample consists primarily of high - ionization bal quasars , and a substantial fraction have large bal velocities or equivalent widths ; their radio luminosities and radio - loudness values span @xmath12.5 orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained 34 new hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) spectra of 28 bal rlqs to compare to earlier sdss data , and we also incorporate archival coverage ( primarily dual - epoch sdss ) for a total set of 78 pairs of equivalent width measurements for 46 bal rlqs , probing rest - frame timescales of @xmath1806000  d ( median 500  d ) . in general , only modest changes in the depths of segments of absorption troughs are observed , akin to those seen in prior studies of bal rqqs . also similar to previous findings for rqqs , </S>",
    "<S> the rlqs studied here are more likely to display bal variability on longer rest - frame timescales </S>",
    "<S> . however , typical values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath140@xmath4% lower for bal rlqs when compared with those of a timescale - matched sample of bal rqqs . </S>",
    "<S> optical continuum variability is of similar amplitude in bal rlqs and bal rqqs ; for both rlqs and rqqs , continuum variability tends to be stronger on longer timescales . </S>",
    "<S> bal variability in rlqs does not obviously depend upon their radio luminosities or radio - loudness values , but we do find tentative evidence for greater fractional bal variability within lobe - dominated rlqs . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced bal variability within more edge - on ( lobe - dominated ) rlqs supports some geometrical dependence to the outflow structure .    </S>",
    "<S> galaxies : active  galaxies : jets  quasars : absorption lines </S>"
