    "classical spin models have called the attention of statistical - mechanics and magnetism researchers throughout many years  @xcite .",
    "many techniques have been used in their study , both analytical and numerical , in such a way that a reasonable knowledge of their equilibrium thermodynamics has been achieved , and specially , of their critical properties . among those models",
    ", one could mention the classical spin models , which present the xy ( @xmath17 ) and heisenberg ( @xmath18 ) as particular cases .",
    "an interesting formulation of a @xmath19-vector classical model comes when one adds a kinetic term to its hamiltonian , i.e. , the spin variables may be interpreted as classical rotators ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the terminology `` inertial model '' is currently used .",
    "this additional term does not pose difficulties in the calculation of equilibrium properties within a canonical - ensemble approach , but it turns possible to derive equations of motion for each rotator , which can be integrated by means of a molecular - dynamics procedure . in this way",
    ", the dynamical behaviour of these models can be investigated numerically without the need of introducing any particular type of probabilistic transition rules for changing the microscopic states .",
    "the inertial ferromagnetic xy model was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , within a fully - coupled framework ( i.e. , infinite - range interactions ) , a limit where the mean - field approach becomes exact . mostly referred to as `` hamiltonian mean field '' ( hmf ) model , it became paradigmatic in the study of the dynamical behaviour of classical many - body hamiltonian systems , and it has given rise to a large amount of works  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting features in the hmf model concerns the appearance of metastable states , for some particular initial conditions , whose lifetime grows by increasing the total number of rotators , that could be interpreted as a breakdown of ergodicity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a generalization of the hmf model was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by introducing a distance  @xmath1 between rotators at sites  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 of a given lattice .",
    "moreover , the two - body interaction was assumed to decay with  @xmath1 , like a power - law , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the index  @xmath6 controls the range of the interactions , in such a way that one recovers both the hmf and nearest - neighbour - interaction models in the particular limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . in between these two limits",
    ", one finds an important change of behaviour in the thermodynamic quantities , yielding two physically distinct regimes , namely , the long- ( @xmath20 ) and short - range ( @xmath21 ) interaction regimes  @xcite . in the latter",
    ", one has the usual extensive and intensive quantities , whereas in the former , one may find also nonextensive thermodynamic quantities  @xcite .",
    "this generalization is usually referred to as  @xmath6-xy or  @xmath6-hmf model , and it also has been studied by several groups  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the fully - coupled inertial version of the ferromagnetic heisenberg model has been much less investigated in the literature  @xcite .",
    "metastable , or quasi - stationary states ( qsss ) , also occur for this system , similar to those that appear in the hmf model ; their lifetime diverge by increasing the total number of rotators  @xmath0 , which implies that the order in which the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath22 ) and the infinite - time limit ( @xmath23 ) are considered , becomes important .",
    "more specifically , if we let @xmath22 first , the system remains trapped in these qsss , never reaching the final boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium state , most probably being the qss itself the final state in such a case . in these metastable states ,",
    "thermodynamical quantities , like temperature and magnetization , do not coincide with the canonical - ensemble predictions .",
    "herein , we will modify the fully - coupled inertial ferromagnetic heisenberg model , by introducing a distance  @xmath1 between rotators at sites @xmath2 and  @xmath3 of a given lattice .",
    "analogously to the @xmath6-hmf model  @xcite , the rotator - rotator interaction will be taken to decay with the distance like a power - law , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the interaction part of this hamiltonian has already been studied analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite , within a canonical - ensemble approach to the equilibrium state of the corresponding model , where it was shown that if the two - body interaction is appropriately scaled , a universal thermodynamical behaviour is achieved for @xmath24 , e.g. , relations involving temperature  @xmath25 , magnetization  @xmath26 , and internal energy  @xmath9 become @xmath6-independent in this interval . apart from this study of the equilibrium state , an investigation of the dynamical behaviour of the above - mentioned heisenberg model , and particularly , how the qsss may be affected by the exponent  @xmath6 , has never been addressed in the literature , to our knowledge . in the present work",
    "we study this model on a ring , i.e , @xmath27 with periodic boundary conditions , using molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the qsss behaviour by varying the energy , number of particles , and range of the interaction , i.e. , the exponent  @xmath6 . in the next section",
    "we define the model , the appropriate scaling for the interactions , the canonical - ensemble solution , equations of motion , and initial conditions to be used in the molecular - dynamics procedure . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of our simulations , showing an agreement with some analytical results known in the literature for the equilibrium state , in some particular limits ; most importantly , we show the existence of qsss for energies  @xmath9 below criticality ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "such qsss , which were verified herein for initial conditions corresponding to zero magnetization , appear for values of  @xmath6 in the range @xmath12 , being characterized by durations  @xmath11 that increase for increasing values of  @xmath0 , like those found numerically and analytically in previous works of the similar model of xy rotators  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our main conclusions .",
    "first , let us define the model in terms of  @xmath0 localized interacting classical rotators , on a @xmath28-dimensional hypercubic lattice , through the hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath5 and @xmath30 represents a vector with  @xmath18 components , assigned to the rotator at site  @xmath2 ( similar to a classical heisenberg spin variable ) , allowed to change its direction continuously inside a 3-dimensional sphere of unity radius , leading to the constraint @xmath31  .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 depicts the corresponding angular momentum ( we are considering moments of inertia equal to unit , so that angular momenta and angular velocities are equivalent quantities ) .",
    "the coupling constants may be identified as @xmath33 , where  @xmath1 measures the ( dimensionless ) distance between rotators  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , defined as the minimal one , given that periodic boundary conditions will be considered .",
    "one should notice that the interaction term defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_heisenberg ] ) is long - ranged for @xmath20 , in the sense that if  @xmath34 the partition function does not admit a well - defined thermodynamic limit  @xcite , e.g. , the internal energy per particle diverges in the limit  @xmath35 , so that the system is said to be nonextensive  @xcite .",
    "consequently , in order to calculate the thermodynamic limit adequately whenever  @xmath20 , the quantity  @xmath36 has to be defined appropriately to ensure a total energy proportional to the system size  @xmath0 . for  @xmath7 this",
    "is attained with  @xmath37 , the so - called kac s prescription  @xcite . for a general @xmath38",

    "the need of the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ntil_definicao ] ) , for systems characterized by long - range interactions , began to be realized within a generalized ferrofluid model  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this proposal was applied successfully to a controllable - range interaction ( @xmath6-dependent ) curie - weiss model , where it was shown numerically that by considering such a scaling , the magnetization per particle follows a thermodynamical equation of state ,  @xmath48 , that becomes independent of  @xmath6 in the nonextensive regime  @xcite .",
    "moreover , applications of this scaling for lennard - jones - like systems were carried in ref .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned works , the correctness of the conjectural scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ntil_definicao ] ) has been verified in several other systems , suggesting that it should be valid for a wide variety of systems with long - range interactions  @xcite .    a systematic analysis of eq .",
    "has been particularly undertaken for the @xmath6-xy model  @xcite , whose hamiltonian is identical to eq .  , but",
    "@xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath49 is treated as a two - dimensional classical rotator , allowed to change its direction continuously inside a circle of unit radius . for this system , it was shown both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite that , for @xmath24 , the prescription  ( [ eq : ntil_definicao ] ) associates to the @xmath6-xy model the same thermodynamical behaviour as the one previously known for the case @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the work of ref .",

    "hence , the nontrivial part for the calculation of equilibrium properties of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_heisenberg ] ) comes from the interaction term  @xmath52 .",
    "this term may become troublesome to deal analytically for dimensions @xmath53 , and to our knowledge , it has been investigated analytically only for @xmath27 , i.e. , the linear chain , in some particular regimes of @xmath6 , namely , @xmath54 and @xmath8 .",

    "the growth of  @xmath11 for increasing  @xmath0 represents a well - known feature in models of rotators , like the hmf and @xmath6-xy ( with @xmath141 ) models  @xcite , as well as the inertial heisenberg model  @xcite , yielding significant physical consequences , some of them directly related to the applicability of bg statistical mechanics .",
    "more specifically , the order in which the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath22 ) and the infinite - time limit ( @xmath23 ) are considered becomes mostly relevant in the present case , in such a way that if the thermodynamic limit is carried first , one should remain in a  qss forever .",
    "this may be viewed as a breakdown of ergodicity , with the system being trapped in  a  qss , never reaching the  bg equilibrium state ; consequently , time averages and ensemble averages do not coincide , violating a basic assumption of bg statistical mechanics .",
    "the qss represents the final state in this case ; whether it should be interpreted as a truly equilibrium thermodynamical one represents an important question beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "herein we have defined the duration  @xmath11 of a given qss ( e.g. , those exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_vs_tempo_3_alphas ] ) , as the time at which  @xmath131 presents its halfway between the values at the qss and its corresponding  @xmath132 .",
    "the fact that we are computing this time interval starting from @xmath161 , including a short transient regime before reaching the qss , does not affect our final results , since this small transient becomes negligible in the final computation of  @xmath11 , for sufficiently large values of  @xmath0 . according to this ,",

    "our estimate agrees with the one of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , where @xmath165 was computed .",
    "curiously , such an estimate has also been found numerically for qsss of the hmf model , with similar initial conditions ( zero magnetization )  @xcite , being supported through analytical approaches in ref .",
    "one should mention that in the case @xmath159 the qsss are more difficult to be observed , appearing only for sufficiently high values of  @xmath0 , such that data points for smaller  @xmath0 are not exhibited . in spite of such difficulties ,",
    "our simulations suggest that one should have @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "although relevant , it is not possible to propose a particular scaling behaviour describing the decrease of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath6 , on the basis of the present numerical simulations .",
    "such a scaling deserves further computational efforts , from which one could obtain a larger number of data points for an appropriate plot of @xmath14 versus @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the xy case ) .",
    "the behaviours of the duration  @xmath11 of the present qsss with respect to the total energy  @xmath9 , as well as its decrease with the parameter  @xmath6 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : behavior_qss_ua ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : behavior_qss_ua](a ) we exhibit data of simulations of @xmath136 rotators , for three values of  @xmath6 ( @xmath134 , and @xmath135 ) , varying the energy in the range @xmath166 .",
    "these results show that  @xmath11 grows exponentially for increasing  @xmath9 in this range , as can be seen more clearly through the log - linear representation in the inset .",
    "although  @xmath11 may become very large as @xmath167 , from the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : t_vs_tempo_varios_u ] one sees that the gap between the kinetic temperature of each qss and the equilibrium state , represented by  @xmath132 , decreases as  @xmath9 approaches  @xmath140 .",
    "hence , in this case , the qsss disappear by means of the difference between these two quantities , which goes to zero as @xmath167 , so that for @xmath168 one finds no qsss .",
    "the dependence of  @xmath11 on the interaction - range parameter  @xmath6 ( @xmath169 ) is presented in fig .",

    "we have carried molecular - dynamics simulations on a one - dimensional hamiltonian system , composed by  @xmath0 classical localized heisenberg rotators on a ring .",
    "we have considered the two - body interaction characterized by a distance  @xmath1 between rotators at sites  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , decaying with the distance  @xmath1 as a power law , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . in this way",
    ", one may control the range of the interactions by changing the parameter  @xmath6 , and specially , two well - known cases may be recovered , namely , the fully - coupled ( i.e. , mean - field limit ) and nearest - neighbour - interaction models , in the limits  @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . for the first time in the literature , we have numerically established the validity of the correct scaling for spin dimensionality @xmath173 . considering this scaling , one obtains the same thermodynamical behaviour for any  @xmath6 in the range @xmath174 , as analytically predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of the model by following the time evolution of a single copy of rotators , for energies  @xmath9 below its critical value ( @xmath10 ) , considering initial conditions corresponding to zero magnetization .",
    "analogously to what happens for the similar model of xy rotators , we have verified the existence of quasi - stationary states ( qsss ) for values of  @xmath6 in the range @xmath12 .",
    "but , in contrast to the xy rotators , the allowed number of initial conditions of the present model is substantially larger .",
    "the particular types of initial conditions that will lead the system to robust qsss was discussed , representing a very relevant matter for further analytical investigations . for a given energy  @xmath9 , our numerical analysis indicated that the durations  @xmath11 grow by increasing  @xmath0 , following a power law , @xmath13 , where the exponent @xmath14 gets reduced for increasing values of  @xmath6 in the range @xmath12 ; particularly , our results suggest that @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "the relevance of establishing the growth of @xmath11 with  @xmath0 accurately , achieved herein by considering sufficiently large values of  @xmath0 , may be assessed if one takes into account the fact that in spite of the large amount of effort dedicated to the @xmath6-xy model , this matter is still controversial for this system ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the particular scaling behaviour , describing the decrease of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath6 , requires further computational efforts and is left for future investigations .",
    "moreover , for the initial conditions and energy range considered , we have shown that the duration of the qsss grows exponentially with the energy , @xmath175 , for  @xmath0 and  @xmath6 fixed .",
    "our simulations have indicated that the gaps separating the kinetic temperature of these qsss and their corresponding equilibrium temperatures  @xmath132 become larger for smaller energies , dropping to zero as @xmath139 . in this way , the qsss disappear by means of the difference between these two quantities , which goes to zero as  @xmath167 , so that for @xmath168 one finds no qsss .",
    "we have found qsss over a wide range of energies , typically for @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) , although these states presented zero magnetization throughout a smaller interval , @xmath151 .",
    "it should be mentioned that we have chosen to explore more deeply the qsss associated with a given value of energy ( @xmath142 ) , where such states could be observed easily through simulations of a single copy of rotators .",
    "however , the results presented herein for this particular energy should be valid for any similar qss ( characterized by zero magnetization ) in the range @xmath151 . by going further below the critical point , roughly for @xmath152 , qsss were still found numerically , but in contrast to the above - mentioned ones , they are characterized by finite values of magnetization , in spite of the initial conditions of zero magnetization considered . within a small energy range ( typically @xmath155 ) , the numerical data of the kinetic temperature of these qsss versus  @xmath9 yielded a negative microcanonical specific heat . although this represents a well - known feature for the hmf model , it is the first time that such a result has been verified for a system of heisenberg rotators , to our knowledge .",
    "the particular case @xmath153 of the present analysis ( carried herein for the cartesian components of angular momenta and spin variables ) , coincides precisely with the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , which have considered angular variables and their corresponding canonically - conjugated angular momenta .",
    "herein , we have extended these results for power - law decaying interactions among spin variables , by investigating situations characterized by @xmath178 , showing that interesting qsss appear for any  @xmath6 in the range @xmath12 . due to the wide diversity of possibilities for initial conditions in both spins and angular momenta in the present model , investigations for qsss under initial conditions different from the ones considered",
