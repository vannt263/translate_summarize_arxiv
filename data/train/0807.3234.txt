    "the spatial arrangement of vortices and c points is also anomalous , with these singularities forming dense clusters of a kind not found in normal speckle fields , fig . [",

    "positive ( negative ) topological charges are surrounded by a local net excess of negative ( positive ) charge , leading to charge neutrality within a characteristic distance , the screening length , that can be less than the average separation between charges [ @xmath9 .",
    "singular sources , such as a ring of finite radius but zero width [ @xmath10 , produce random fields that exhibits long - range screening [ @xmath11 .",

    "destroy the local charge neutrality that would produce short range screening , and screening sets in only asymptotically .",
    "thus , both short- and long - range screening depend upon the spatial arrangements of the charges .",
    "these arrangements are anomalous in speckled speckle , which can therefore be expected to exhibit unusual forms of screening .",
    "a major observable consequence of screening is strong damping of fluctuations of the topological charge @xmath12 .",
    "these fluctuations are characterized by their variance @xmath13 ; the behavior of @xmath13 for speckled speckle is our main concern here .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .  in section",
    "ii we discuss the charge variance in a bounded region , in section iii we review @xmath14 in normal speckle for fields with short- and with long - range correlations , and in sections iv - vii we present results for @xmath13 for four qualitatively different forms of speckled speckle .",

    "thus , long - range screening yields a charge variance that grows asymptotically as @xmath34 ; this growth rate is significantly faster than the short - range growth rate proportional to @xmath17 , but is very much slower than the unscreened rate proportional to @xmath35 .",
