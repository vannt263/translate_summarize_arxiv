    "<S> exchange splitting remains weak compared to the superconducting gap , the dominant fourier component of the josephson current is @xmath3 periodic . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to note that this result for the josephson current is different from the realization of the @xmath2 josephson effect discussed by zhang and kane @xcite which has a dominant @xmath1-periodic fourier component .    </S>",
    "<S> second , it is important to realize that so far , our results consider only the electronic system and neglect coupling to other degrees of freedom such as phonons or the electromagnetic environment . relaxing this restriction introduces inelastic relaxation processes which may be crucial for determining the experimentally observed periodicity . while relaxation between states of opposite fermion parity may be quite slow </S>",
    "<S> , relaxation beween states of the same fermion parity should be considerably more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> observation of the @xmath1 periodicity requires that the latter relaxation processes are slow compared to the period in which the @xmath1 cycle is traversed . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the two @xmath3 sections of the @xmath1 cycle involve states of the same fermion parity , so that one would always remain in the lower - energy state if the cycle is traversed slowly on the time scale of parity - conserving relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> this would make the observed josephson effect @xmath3 rather than @xmath1 periodic .    </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing to compare these results to the recent experiments on quantum spin hall junctions which observe shapiro steps and josephson radiation consistent with @xmath3 periodicity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide an interesting scenario that is in principle consistent with these observations . at the same time , this is by no means the only explanation of a @xmath3-periodic josephson effect in this system . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative scenario considers relaxation processes in a pristine quantum spin hall junction . </S>",
    "<S> consider an intermediate - length junction with at least two positive - energy andreev states for any phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> when both of these andreev states are occupied , the two quasiparticles can relax inelastically by recombining into a cooper pair . </S>",
    "<S> two positive - energy quasiparticles are created every time the phase difference advances by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if their recombination into a cooper pair is an efficient process , one would also observe a @xmath3-periodic josephson effect . </S>",
