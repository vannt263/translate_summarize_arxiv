    "the cnts were synthesized by using an injection chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) method , where a mist of ethanol , ferrocene ( 2 wt% ) , and thiophene ( 1 vol% ) was injected at a rate of 2030 ml / h into a heated gas flow reactor ( diameter 80 mm ) .",
    "a gas mixture of ar ( 3500 sccm ) and ( 4250 sccm ) were also injected into the reactor tube as a carrier gas .",
    "the temperature in reaction region was set to 1300 .",
    "the grown cnts formed a sock - like aerogel in the gas flow and were blown out with the carrier gas .",
    "the cnt aerogel was winded on a roller with the aid of liquid densification ( ethanol was used here ) . by controlling the winding number , cnt films with a thickness ranging from 1030",
    "were finally obtained .",
    "the basic structural units of the as - produced cnt films were small - sized cnt bundles , which usually had a diameter of 4050 nm and contained about 50 cnts .",
    "once the ferrocene concentration or the injection rate is increased , larger - sized bundles can be obtained . by controlling the growth parameters , such as the concentration of ferrocene and growth temperature , it was possible to change the number of cnts in a bundle and number of walls of individual cnt .",
    "raman spectra of the cnts showed a high g to d - band intensity ratio ( @xmath15 ) , corresponding to a high level of crystallinity ( figure [ fig.raman]a ) .",
    "the raman signals of radial breathing modes ( rbms ) also indicated that there existed a large number of double - walled cnts .",
    "further , thermal gravimetric analysis showed that there was about 9 wt% mass left for the as - produced cnt films after being heated up to 800 in air ( figure [ fig.raman]b ) .",

    "( a ) raman spectra obtained at different positions of one film .",
    "( b ) thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that the cnt content was more than 91 wt% by considering the oxidation of iron . ]",
    "as discussed in the main text , the entanglement was not altered after liquid densification .",
    "figure [ fig.densified ] shows two acetone - densified cnt networks . as",
    "compared to figure [ fig.entanglement]a ( in the main article ) , it is clear that the pore size had decreased from @xmath1500 nm to @xmath0100200 nm , while the feature of random distribution and aggregation structure was maintained .",
    "the densification mainly took place along the direction perpendicular to the film surface , that is , different cnt layers ( due to the winding process ) were drawn closer , while the shrinkage of film width and length was less than 25% ( but measurable ) . therefore , it became possible to introduce resin molecules into the cnt films without aggregating the cnt bundles .",
    "as the bismaleimide ( bmi ) resins had a softening point smaller than 60 and demonstrated a viscous liquid property , we call the resin - impregnated cnt films as `` wet '' films while the pure cnt films as dry ones .",
    "the tensile strength , strain at break , and toughness ( the area covered under stress - strain curve ) of the as - produced dry films were up to 180198 mpa , 2026% , and 3237 mpa , respectively ( figure [ fig.raw-tensile]a ) .",
    "stretching the dry films to align cnts is the simplest method to improve the mechanical properties . by stretching directly by 20% within one minute and then maintaining the stretching to relax for 1030 min , the films exhibited improved strengths and toughness , up to 492620 mpa and 3540 mpa , respectively . in the stretched film ,",
    "cnts became much more aligned ( figure [ fig.raw-tensile]b ) , making the modulus larger than 12 gpa .",
    "it is important to notice that , during the stretching process the cnts not only became aligned , but also aggregated to form large - size bundles ( as labelled by arrows in figure [ fig.raw-tensile]b ) .",
    "the aggregation can benefit the load transfer between cnts in the stretched dry films , however , might become weak part in composite films by impregnating bmi resins and then curing them .",
    "this is because the aggregated cnts transfer loads just depending on the intertube sliding friction while the bmi network can increase significantly the interfacial interactions with cnt surfaces and connect non - neighboring cnts , resulting in much more efficient load transfer within polymer - bridged cnts .",
    "this means , getting rid of cnt aggregation has become a challenge as important as improving interfacial interaction and cnt alignment . to further confirm the effect of aggregation",
    ", bmi resins were impregnated into the stretched dry films .",
    "as the aggregation existed , such cnt / bmi composite film exhibited a tensile strength up to only 585801 mpa , after being cured .",
    "to avoid cnt aggregation , the as - produced cnt films were impregnated with 1 wt% bmi resin / acetone solutions prior to the stretching process . by controlling the total volume of solution ,",
    "`` wet '' films at different cnt - to - resin mass ratios were produced , namely 9:1 , 8:2 , 7:3 , and 5:5 ( similarly , the ratio for dry films was 10:0 ) .",
    "the `` wet '' films had different strain at break at different mass ratios ( figure [ fig.wet-tensile ] ) .",
    "when a small amount of resins were impregnated , the resin molecules could not sufficiently cover the cnt surfaces and thus caused significant inhomogeneity within the film .",
    "therefore the film became easier to fracture .",
    "when more resins were used , the film became more and more plastic and even can be stretched by @xmath030% .",
    "this means that the wet environment gives the film enhanced processability .",
    "notice that the 10:0 sample had a different strain at break from the tensile tests shown in figure [ fig.raw-tensile]a .",
    "this is because the widths of the test samples were 10 and 2 mm for the samples in figure [ fig.wet-tensile ] and [ fig.raw-tensile ] , respectively .",
    "as compared to small samples , assembly defects ( in the as - produced cnt network ) make the fracture easier for large ones .",
    "in fact , the tensile results of large samples reflected the real processability , as the resin impregnation and stretching processes were performed on cnt films with a width of 1 cm .",
    "the low - softening - point bmi ( l - bmi ) resins were synthesized by modifying traditional bmi monomers with diallyl bisphenol a ( dba ) . besides the dba modification , the original molecular structure of bmi monomers also determines remarkably on the softening dynamics . as a comparison study ,",
    "the dba - modified resins with larger molecular weight of monomers , higher molecular rigidity , and thus higher softening point , the h - bmi resins , were also used to show their influences on the processability of cnt / bmi composite films .",
    "rheological measurement , the viscosity - temperature relationship , reveals that the viscosity of l - bmi decreased to below 20 at @xmath058 while such temperature was @xmath080 for h - bmi ( figure [ fig.bmi]a ) . by impregnating them into cnt films at the same mass ratio of 7:3",
    ", the tensile measurements showed different increase in strain at break .",
    "the cnt / h - bmi `` wet '' film fractured at @xmath015% while the cnt / l - bmi at more than 22% ( figure [ fig.bmi]b , sample width 10 mm ) .",
    "the as - produced cnt films are first impregnated by bmi resin / acetone solution . as acetone has a high infiltration ability into cnt assemblies , the impregnation can easily make all the cnt bundles surrounded by the resin molecules and avoid the aggregation of cnts .",
    "`` wet '' films containing a designed cnt - to - resin mass ratio are prepared by using the low - softening - point resins .",
    "these `` wet '' films can be directly stretched by @xmath020% in a one - step way .",
    "the one - step stretching can effectively align the cnts , however , as the lack of relaxation during the stretching , the entangled or cross - linked segments can not be fully aligned and thus hinder the densification process .",
    "a multi - step stretching method is used to introduce the relaxation process . in this way ,",
    "the `` wet '' film is always stretched slightly in each step , by 23% , and there are 510 minutes to relax the film before the next stretching .",
    "if the stretching magnitude @xmath8 depends on the current film length , after @xmath9 steps , the total stretching magnitude can be calculated by @xmath10 .",
    "( the stretching magnitude can be confirmed by the final length increase as compared to the original length . )",
    "if the stretching length @xmath11 is always fixed , the total stretching magnitude is then @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the original film length .",
    "the relaxation process plays important roles in optimizing cnt alignment and level of densification for the `` wet '' films , which can be represented by the mechanical properties of the cured samples and the mass density as well .",

    "the curing profile was 140 for 0.5 h , 170 for 3 h , 220 for 2 h , and 250 for 3 h. the introduction of 140 treatment was found to be also important to liquidize the resin molecules and further improved homogeneity in the composite structure .",
    "comparison of tensile properties between different cnt / bmi films which include the unstretched , one - step stretched ( by 10% and 20% ) , and multi - step stretched ( by 19% ) films .",
    "the cnt - to - resin mass ratio was 7:3 . ]",
    "the one - step stretching was applied by 10% and 20% , respectively , on `` wet '' films with the cnt - to - resin mass ratio of 7:3 . after being cured ,",
    "the two stretched composite films exhibited tensile strengths of 1.121.24 gpa and 1.741.92 gpa , respectively , while the unstretched composite films had strengths less than 500 mpa ( figure [ fig.one-step ] ) .",
    "this can be ascribed to the insufficient alignment of cnts .",
    "furthermore , as compared to the multi - step stretching , the lack of relaxation process resulted in inhomogeneity in the composite structure .",
    "for example , when the `` wet '' films were stretched by 19% in the multi - step way , there should not be a significant difference in alignment as compared to the 20% one - step stretched films .",
    "however , the inhomogeneity in one - step stretched films reduced the efficiency of load transfer between cnt bundles and thus hindered the increase in elastic modulus . as a result ,",
    "their tensile strengths of 2.192.79 gpa were much larger , at least by 450870 mpa .      in the multi - step stretching , we set @xmath14 and the relaxation time to be 10 min , and thus the total stretching magnitude was @xmath15 .",
    "the maximum number of steps differed from sample to sample . for the 7:3 `` wet '' film @xmath16 while for the 8:2 film @xmath17 .",
    "we also tried to stretch the film by a fixed length of 1 mm in each step ( the original length and width was about 35 mm and 10 mm , respectively ) .",
    "however , we did not observe any difference between these two treatments .",
    "to further increase the maximum stretching magnitude , studies should be performed on the cvd process where the cnt structure and formation of cnt network are determined .",
    "figure [ fig.multi-step ] shows the stress - strain curves of cured cnt / bmi films after being multi - step stretched .",
    "the highest performance was found for the 7:3 films being stretched by 34% ( @xmath18 ) . the tensile strengths and moduli ( both in units of gpa ) of these tests were 6.940/284.2 , 6.438/314.9 , 6.265/299.0 , 5.907/350.6 , 5.842/246.8 , and 5.773/211.9 , respectively .",
    "even just being stretched up to 25% , the tensile strength was still found to range from 3.83 to 6.31 gpa , higher than traditional carbon fiber / epoxy composites and recently reported high performance cnt / bmi composites .    as compared to the 7:3 mass ratio ,",
    "the 8:2 ratio resulted in a maximum stretching magnitude of @xmath027% and final tensile strengths ranging from 3.42 to 4.65 gpa .",
    "this means that for high performance composites based on polymer impregnation into cnt assemblies , the polymer content should be around 30 wt% .",
    "when more bmi were introduced into the film , like mass ratios of 6:4 and 5:5 , the bmi aggregation appeared and became structural defects to make the film more brittle than the 7:3 or 8:2 ones .",
    "herman s orientation factor ( hof ) is a commonly used parameter to characterize orientation and has been successfully used for determining the alignment level for cnt arrays .",
    "it takes the value 1 for a system with perfect orientation parallel to a reference direction , and zero for completely nonoriented samples .",
    "the calculation of hof is based on the intensity profile @xmath19 of orientation angle @xmath20 between the structural unit vector and the reference direction , according to its definition @xmath21 where @xmath22 here the intensity profile was obtained by using the ` orientation ' property of ` regionprops ' in matlab , where an sem image should be first converted to be strongly contrasted .",

    "the reference direction was taken to be the horizontal line for each image .",
    "for the original film , the orientation within [ -5,5 ] was only 9.2% in the total counting of the orientation angles .",
    "after being stretched , the [ -5,5 ] fraction increased up to 63.0% and 74.5% .",
    "however , as the stretching magnitude for the one - step stretching was only 20% in length , there were still some orientation angles larger than 40 ( 6.6% in the angle counting ) . according to these profiles , the hofs were 0.209 , 0.632 , and 0.816 , respectively . obviously , the cnt alignment was significantly improved after the one - step and multi - step stretching treatments .",

    "about 16.5 n / mm in average ( figure [ fig.load ] ) , and thus the specific strength ( by dividing the force per width by the area density ) was @xmath02.87",

    "<S> the low softening point resulted in a soft and viscous state even at room temperature , like soft wax , and thus the cnt film impregnated with bmi resins was called as a `` wet '' film . </S>",
    "<S> the less-``wet '' cnt / h - bmi films ( cnt - to - resin mass ratio 7:3 ) could be only stretched directly by 16% while the `` wet '' cnt / l - bmi films ( 7:3 ) were by @xmath120% ( see supplementary information , figure [ fig.bmi ] ) . of great importance </S>",
    "<S> , the `` wet '' feature also allowed structural relaxation as sufficient as possible during the multi - step stretching process . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , the 16%-stretched cnt / h - bmi composite films exhibited a tensile strength of @xmath01.5 gpa , as comparable to the cnt / l - bmi composites ( see supplementary information , figure [ fig.one-step ] ) , indicating that the major difference of the resins was the plasticizing ability rather than the strengthening ability </S>",

    "<S> ( f ) cross section of the optimal cnt / bmi composite structure by using focused ion beam treatment . ]    thermal treatment at 750 in ar for 1.5 h was performed on the cnt / bmi composite films to decompose bmi polymers . </S>",
    "<S> after the decomposition , the remaining bmi polymers formed flake - like particles , and thus exposed the cnts which might maintain their aggregation level . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this method can serve as evidences for cnt aggregation and unaggregation . </S>",
    "<S> two cnt / bmi composite films were tested , where the stretching process was performed before and after the impregnation of bmi resins , respectively . as shown in figure [ fig.sem]d and e , </S>",
    "<S> there was clearly no aggregation of cnt bundles by using our new processing method .    </S>",
    "<S> it was possible to observe directly the cross section of the optimal structure by using focused ion beam treatment ( figure [ fig.sem]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> although it was difficult to distinguish individual cnts , the small - sized cnt bundles were pictured perpendicular to the cross section and polymer matrix surrounded all their surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> such homogeneity maximized interface contacts and thus provided the most efficient cnt - to - polymer stress transfer . by considering the fact that the bundling within a dimension of 2050 nm was only determined during the growth </S>",
    "<S> , there is still a last step to obtain the ideal structure where individual cnts are aligned , highly packed , and unaggregated .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is no doubt that the stretching treatment improved the cnt alignment , nevertheless , quantitative characterization of alignment is still of great interest . in the present study , </S>",
    "<S> the characterization was represented by the herman s orientation factor ( hof ) which has been used to study the alignment level for cnt arrays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hof takes the value 1 for a system with full alignment and zero for completely nonoriented structures . </S>",
    "<S> the hof of the original film was only 0.209 , well reflecting the random cnt distribution . </S>",
    "<S> after being stretched by about 20% and 34% , the hof increased remarkably up to 0.632 and 0.816 , respectively . ( the calculation method and the detailed results are provided in supplementary information . )    </S>",
    "<S> * specific strengths . * </S>",
    "<S> another way to describe the tensile property is specific strength , also known as the strength - to - weight ratio . in this way it not necessary to know the film thickness . for the films multi - step stretched by @xmath025% in length , the total mass for a 2 @xmath51 cm sample was 1.15 mg , corresponding to an area density of 0.58 . </S>",
    "<S> the fracture force per sample width was about 16.5 in average ( see supplementary information , figure [ fig.load ] ) , and thus the specific strength ( by dividing the force per width by the area density ) was @xmath02.87 . when the stretching magnitude was improved to 34% , the fracture force per width was @xmath019.5 ( see supplementary information , figure [ fig.load ] ) , the area density decreased slightly to 0.46 , and the specific strength was @xmath04.24 .    the volumetric mass density for the 34% stretched film was measured to be @xmath01.55 according to archimedes principle , where the film became suspended within a mixed solution containing dichloromethane ( ) and diiodomethane ( ) with a volume ratio of 13:2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the engineering strength ( product of specific strength and volumetric density ) should be about 6.57 gpa .    * damping properties . * </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement of cnts resulted in high damping performance for the as - produced dry films ( figure [ fig.damping ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the loss factor @xmath6 at 50 hz was nearly 0.2 at room temperature , decreased gradually to 0.1 as being heated up to 400 ( figure [ fig.damping]a ) , and linearly increased with vibration amplitude ( figure [ fig.damping]b ) and frequency ( figure [ fig.damping]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for the high damping performance was suggested to be the sliding and de - bonding between cnt bundles .     </S>",
    "<S> loss factor of various films as functions of temperature ( a ) , vibration amplitude ( b ) , and frequency ( c ) . ]    for the composite structures , these energy - cost phenomenon nearly disappeared as the bmi polymers made all the bundles adhered to each other and there no longer existed the so - called `` interfaces '' between different aggregation phases . at room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the loss factor was even smaller than 0.05 for low - frequency vibrations ( figure [ fig.damping]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the glass transition of polymer , the loss factor increased remarkably above 200 .    the high loss factor of the as - produced films ( comparable to rubber ) to makes it possible to develop new - type high damping materials , based on the arrangement - induced viscoelastic behavior @xcite , while the cnt / bmi composite films can be developed as superior structural materials to be used in aerospace , automotive , and other transportation industries .    </S>",
    "<S> * electrical properties . </S>",
    "<S> * the ability to conduct electricity of a thin film is usually characterized by sheet resistance or square resistance , in units of `` ohms per square '' . </S>",
    "<S> the square resistance of the as - produced film was 1.194 , by using the four - point probe method . </S>",
    "<S> after being impregnated with bmi resins , the resistance decreased to 0.926 , owing to the densification effect . after being stretched , </S>",
    "<S> the cnt network was aligned and the connections between cnt bundles were separated by bmi resins . as a result , the resistance increased to 1.461 . </S>",
    "<S> the curing process finally fixed the composite structure where neither cnts nor polymers aggregated , and the resistance further increased to 1.931 . by considering the final film thickness of @xmath03 , </S>",
    "<S> the electrical conductivity was @xmath7 s , about 0.3% or 12% of copper s or stainless steel s electrical conductivity .    in summary , based on the unique properties of raw materials of cnts and resins ( entanglement , unaggregation , high plasticity , and low softening point ) and the multi - step stretching method , we have been able to obtain a magic composite structure where neither cnts nor polymers formed aggregated phases , a big step to approach the ideal composite structure that can fully utilize all the cnt surfaces in load transferring . </S>",
    "<S> the highest tensile strength was up to 6.94 gpa ( or about 4.24 ) , much higher than the strength of carbon fiber reinforced polymers . </S>",
    "<S> the cnt / bmi composite films also exhibited high ability to conduct electricity . </S>",
    "<S> as in such composite structure nearly all the surfaces of nanometer - sized components can be used , based on the bio - inspired aggregation control , we anticipate that the present fabrication method can be generalized for developing multifunctional and smart nanocomposites .    * methods . * </S>",
    "<S> the cnts were mainly double - walled and were synthesized with an injection chemical vapor deposition method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the grown cnts formed a sock - like aerogel and were winded on a roller with the aid of ethanol densification to obtain 2d cnt films . </S>",
    "<S> the as - produced cnt films were impregnated by bmi resin / acetone solutions with designed cnt - to - resin mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal cnt - to - resin mass ratio was about 7:3 . </S>",
    "<S> then the resin - impregnated films were stretched by more than 30% in length , in a multi - step way where sufficient structural relaxation was allowed after every step . </S>",
    "<S> the stretched films were cured according to the designed profile , namely , 140 for 0.5 h , 170 for 3 h , 220 for 2 h , and 250 for 3 h , with a pressure of 68 mpa .    </S>",
    "<S> tensile tests were performed on an instron 3365 universal test machine ( instron corp . , </S>",
    "<S> norwood , usa ) at a strain rate of 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the film samples were cut into 2.53 @xmath50.52 mm pieces , and the gauge length was larger than 10 mm . some tensile tests to show the processability </S>",
