    "scanning hall probe microscopy ( shpm ) is a popular local magnetic characterization technique @xcite . among common",
    "non - invasive magnetic imaging techniques , shpm is particularly useful due to a number of advantages . in comparison to magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) and magneto - optical imaging ( moi )",
    ", shpm enables direct quantitative mapping of magnetic field .",
    "mfm is more challenging for quantitative measurements as characterization and modeling of the magnetization of the tip are rather difficult @xcite . in comparison to moi , shpm works in a much larger magnetic field range , and offers better spatial resolution in the case when the sample is not completely flat @xcite .",
    "though shpm involves longer image acquisition time than moi unlike in a scanning probe system , in moi the whole image is acquired at one time , and involves acquisition times of a few seconds at most ) and offers worse spatial resolution compared to mfm , the unique compromise between spatial resolution and field sensitivity makes it a very useful tool for convenient non - destructive quantitative characterization over wide temperature and field ranges . over the years",
    ", efforts have been made to improve the spatial resolution and scan range @xcite , temperature range @xcite , and magnetic field resolution @xcite of shpm .    in this paper",
    "we report on a room temperature shpm system developed to characterize arrays of micro - magnets .",
    "shpm is the tool of choice for quantifying the stray fields produced by micro - magnets , which have many applications in bio - medical studies @xcite and mems @xcite .",
    "the present shpm system demonstrates the usefulness of a combination of concepts , tuning fork feedback based height control , monolithic electronics for regulation and hall signal read out , scanning with stepper motors , compared to microscopes presented before@xcite . microstructured hall probes with active area of size 1 - 5",
    "@xmath2 m have been fabricated for use in the microscope .",
    "the characteristics of the microscope include : large in - plane scan range ( up to a few mm , limited by sample topography ) with fine scan resolution ( step resolution of the motors is 0.1 @xmath2 m , which is , in principle , the minimum possible scan resolution .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of the magnetic field distribution obtained in this technique is limited by the size of the hall probes as the detected magnetic field is the average field over the active area of the probe ) and large @xmath3 range , allowing sample - probe distances from @xmath4 2 @xmath2 m to 35 mm , with a step resolution of 0.2 @xmath2 m , as well as large magnetic field detection ( fields up to @xmath6 1 t have been measured ) with high field resolution ( 100 @xmath2 t ) .",
    "apart from scanning , the system is also capable of fast recording of local @xmath5 profiles . in the following sections , we first describe the microscope .",
    "this is followed by some results showcasing the capabilities of the microscope .",
    "figures [ f1](a ) and [ f1](b ) show a schematic and an optical image , respectively , of the microscope .",
    "the microscope is mounted on a vibration - isolation table .",
    "vibrations from the floor are filtered by a concrete block supported by rubber dampers filled with compressed air flowing viscously between the dampers and air reservoirs .",
    "the microscope is mounted on a copper block that rests on the concrete block .",
    "the microscope consists of two separate parts , viz . , a mobile part which consists of a sample holder placed on an xyz stage , and a fixed part which consists of the probe mounted on a tuning fork .",
    "this second part includes piezoelectric elements for @xmath3-regulation , tuning fork excitation , and all electrical connections involved in the measurement .",
    "note that it is important that both of these parts rest on the same base ( in this case the copper block ) as otherwise additional and uncontrolled tilt between the sample and probe planes would arise which would lead to unnecessary complications in sample - probe distance regulation .",
    "the microscope is covered with a 50 @xmath7 50 @xmath7 60 @xmath8 opaque enclosure to minimize the influence of ambient light .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows a schematic of the complete setup . a fast lockin - amplifier ( zurich instruments hf2li , henceforth referred to as the hf2li ) @xcite serves as the primary electronics component of the microscope .",
    "it is used to provide the excitation signal as well as to measure the current from the tuning fork .",
    "it is also used to provide the hall probe excitation current as well as to measure the generated hall voltage .",
    "finally , it also provides the pid control for the @xmath3-piezo stack mentioned ( explained below ) .",
    "all control and measurement operations are performed through custom - built reliable and user - friendly labview programs developed specifically for the setup .",
    "the mobile sample stage consists of the sample holder base mounted on the primary scanning component which is a micos stepper motor stage as shown in figure [ f1](c ) .",
    "the sample can be moved in all three directions ( x , y , z ) by virtue of the stepper motors .",
    "the three micos motors used are : two linear stages precision linear stage pls-85@xcite for x and y motion , and one linear stage linear stage ls-65@xcite for z motion.the travel range in x and y directions is 50 mm and the minimum step size is 0.1 @xmath2 m .",
    "this minimum step size is precise enough for the primary purposes the microscope is built for . in our microscope , the stepper motors themselves perform the scanning , additional piezo scanners are superfluous . as a result , in principle , the maximum achievable scan range is the same as the travel range of the x / y motors = 50 mm .",
    "however , in practice , the effective scan range is limited by the properties of the sample being measured .",
    "most often , irregularities of the sample surface mean that the probe - sample distance regulation ( discussed in section [ subsubsecdistregulation ] ) can be maintained only over a smaller distance , thus limiting the scan range .",
    "we have been able to perform scans over areas as large as 2.5 mm @xmath7 2.5 mm ( cf .",

    ", 5 @xmath2 m and 7 mm @xmath7 25 mm in ref . , and 0.1 @xmath2 m and 1 mm @xmath7 1 mm in ref .. all three motors in our setup are characterized by very reliable repeatability ( negligible backlash error ) .",
    "the linear stages are controlled by a smc corvus pcicontroller @xcite installed in the pc .",
    "the system has a fast response , allowing stepping at 50 ms intervals . at this stepping interval ,",
    "a typical scan ( 200 @xmath7 200 pixel ) takes about two hours with additional overheads ( cf .",
    "section [ subsubsecscanprotocol ] for details on the scan protocol ) . in comparison , in the shpm system described in ref .",
    ", a 200 @xmath7 200 pixel scan takes several hours , and in ref .",
    "a 60 @xmath2 m @xmath7 60 @xmath2 m scan with pixel size 1.25 @xmath2 m takes about 90 minutes .",
    "the fixed probe stage consists of the hall probe glued to a commercial quartz tuning fork @xcite which is in turn glued to a probe plate ( cu coated fibre glass plate ) .",
    "electrical connections to the hall probe and tuning fork are anchored on the probe plate .",
    "the tuning fork is mechanically excited through a thickness - modepiezoceramic element below the tuning fork ( labelled excitation piezoin fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) ) @xcite .",
    "the excitation signal is provided from the first output of the hf2li ( cf .",
    "figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "this assembly is attached to a @xmath3-piezo stackextension piezoelectric element @xcite which is used for regulation of the probe - sample distance .",
    "the @xmath3-piezo stack has a vertical extension range @xmath6 32 @xmath2 m ( with input voltage range 0 - 120 v ) .",
    "voltage on the @xmath3-piezo stack is applied through one of the auxiliary outputs of the hf2li via a low noise voltage amplifier with 10x amplification ( cf .",
    "figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the piezo stack is mounted on a base block that can be tilted in order to adjust the angle between the hall probe and the sample surface .",
    "one of the primary challenges in a scanning probe setup is the ability to approach the probe as close as possible to the sample surface without crashing the probe into the sample .",
    "this is achieved by real - time control of the probe - sample distance by regulating the extension of the @xmath3-piezo stack during a scan using the amplitude of vibration of the tuning fork for feedback .",
    "tuning fork feedback based probe - sample distance control was first proposed by khaled karrai and robert d. grober @xcite and has since been widely used in near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) .",
    "this technique has been implemented in scanning squid @xcite and scanning hall probe @xcite microscopes .",
    "the voltage on the @xmath3-piezo stack is regulated by a fast closed - loop proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) control in the hf2li pid settings have been optimized based primarily on the sample surface type .",
    "typical values for samples with hard surfaces ( e.g. , thermomagnetically patterned micromagnets ) are : p = @xmath9 , i = @xmath10 s@xmath11 , d = @xmath12 @xmath2s . for samples with soft surfaces ( e.g. , topographically patterned micromagnets embedded in polymer )",
    "typical values of the parameters are : p = @xmath13 , i = @xmath14 s@xmath11 , d = @xmath15 @xmath2s .",
    "these settings correspond to an integral time constant ( p / i ) = 1 ms .",
    "the pid output is updated at 100 khz .",
    "the input of the pid is the amplitude of vibration of the tuning fork ( cf .",
    "figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "current proportional to the amplitude of vibration is generated in the tuning fork , which is amplified with a current / voltage converter of gain 10@xmath16 v / a , and passed through a high - pass filter ( cut - off frequency 8 khz ) .",
    "the amplified voltage is demodulated by the hf2li and the phase signal is fed into a phase locked loop ( pll ) .",
    "the pll ensures that the tuning fork oscillation frequency always remains in the vicinity of the resonance frequency .",
    "the excitation frequency is adjusted in order to maintain the tuning fork at resonance ( cf .",
    "figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath17 of the free tuning fork is @xmath6 32.768 khz .",
    "however , it depends strongly on environmental conditions .",
    "figure [ f3](a ) shows a typical frequency response of a tuning fork glued to the probe plate .",
    "note that @xmath17 is reduced to @xmath6 31.45 khz .",
    "figure [ f3](b ) shows the frequency response after a probe is glued to the tuning fork . in this case",
    "@xmath17 is further reduced to @xmath6 22.76 khz .",
    "@xmath17 for a tuning fork with a probe attached varies in the range 14 - 23 khz .",
    "note that the amplitude of oscillation of the tuning fork also reduces with increase in load .",
    "this is not obvious from figures [ f3](a ) and [ f3](b ) as the excitation voltage in each case is adjusted such that the amplitude at resonance is always @xmath6 1 v.    further , the amplitude of oscillation monotonically decreases on approaching the sample surface .",
    "this is the basis of the probe - sample distance regulation @xcite .",
    "figure [ f3](c ) shows a typical approach curve for a loaded tuning fork ( i.e. , after a probe is mounted on the tuning fork glued to a probe plate ) .",
    "the @xmath0-axis shows the distance of the tuning fork from the sample surface ( sample surface at @xmath3 = 0 ) .",
    "note from figure [ f3](c ) that as the probe approaches the sample surface , the resonance frequency increases before decreasing , while the amplitude of oscillation decreases monotonically .",
    "hence it is possible to maintain a fixed desired probe - sample distance if the amplitude of oscillation can be regulated .",
    "this is implemented via the pid control of the extension of the @xmath3-piezo stack using the amplitude of oscillation of the tuning fork as input as discussed above . in general , 70% of amplitude of oscillation of the tuning fork when it is far away from the sample surface is used as the desired set - point for probe - sample contact .",
    "for samples with rough and/or soft surfaces , 75 - 80% is set . from figure [ f3](c ) , z @xmath18 470 nm for 70% and 500 nm for 80% .",
    "this is the probe - sample distance which is maintained during a scan in the regulation mode ( cf . section [ subsubsecscanprotocol ] ) .",
    "the hall probes consist of heterostructures of gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) materials .",
    "the two dimensional electron gas is about 50 nm below the surface .",
    "the mesa is first etched with a chemical etch by 100 nm in order to structure the hall cross . then a multilayer of ni / au / ge is evaporated with an e - gun evaporator ( plassys ) .",
    "rapid thermal annealing allows the diffusion of the auge to the two - dimensional electron gas , thus forming the ohmic contacts with the 2deg .",
    "an additional deep etch @xmath6 10 @xmath2 m is made in order to place the hall cross exactly at the corner of the wafer .",
    "finally , the hall probes are cut with a diamond dicing machine .",
    "the electron sheet density @xmath19 is @xmath20 @xmath21 ( calculated from the relation @xmath19 = 1/(@xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the electronic charge and @xmath24 is the hall sensitivity = 200 @xmath25/t , cf .",

    "figure [ f4](c ) shows an sem image of the hall bar showing the hall cross and contact leads .",
    "the hall cross is identified by the red lines drawn on the image .",
    "the four edges of the hall cross are marked as 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the distances of the hall cross from the edges of the hall bar are shown as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "hall probes of size 1 - 5 @xmath2 m have been prepared .",
    "the particular probe shown here is of size @xmath6 4 @xmath2 m .",
    "resistance values through the probes were found to be @xmath6 15 - 17 k@xmath25 for the smaller probes and 5 - 6 k@xmath25 for the larger probes .",
    "though hall probes of smaller size have been prepared with gaas / algaas , smaller sizes are also associated with lower field sensitivity@xcite , hence the size of the present probes is suitable for our purposes .      the hall probe is excited with an ac signal from the second output of the hf2li through a 100k@xmath25 resistor in series .",
    "the hall excitation current is set in the range 10 - 50 @xmath2a ( pk - pk ) .",
    "the frequency of excitation is set at 522 hz .",
    "this was chosen empirically to correspond to minimum noise in the output signal . the amplified and filtered hall voltage is detected at the second input of the hf2li ( cf . figure [ f2 ] ) . a number of hall probes",
    "have been used in the measurements .",
    "all the hall probes show remarkably consistent magnetic field sensitivity .",
    "the hall probes were calibrated using a pre - calibrated copper coil magnet ( 16.83 g / a , or 1.683 mt / a ) @xcite .",
    "for calibration , a hall probe is placed at the center of the magnet and the hall voltage is measured for a set of values of current flowing through the solenoid ( corresponding to magnetic field values in the range -8 mt to + 8 mt , in the magnet ) .",
    "figure [ f4](d ) shows typical calibration data for one of the hall probes .",

    "[ f4](d ) it is clear that the hall resistance varies very linearly with magnetic field .",
    "from the linear fit , the hall sensitivity ( @xmath24 ) = is found to be 200 @xmath33 2 @xmath25/t for all the used probes , which is consistent with the fact that hall probe sensitivity is nearly independent of the hall cross area @xcite . in our hall",
    "probes the doping level is rather high which results in the relatively lower hall sensitivity compared to some other reported values at room temperature ( 300 k ) for gaas / algaas heterostructures ( 3000 @xmath25/t in ref .",
    ", 2000 @xmath25/t in ref . , 1750 @xmath25/t in ref . ) however , it is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we believe this also ensures that conduction always takes place preferentially in the 2deg as there are many charge carriers available .",
    "indeed , the hall sensitivity was measured at room temperature as well as down to 50 mk and is found to be nearly constant in this temperature range ( variation smaller than 5% ) .",
    "once the sensitivity of the hall probe is known , the measured hall voltage @xmath32 can be simply converted to magnetic field @xmath34 as , @xmath35 or , @xmath36 note that there is always some offset voltage , i.e. , a non - zero measured hall voltage even in zero field .",
    "this can appear due to various reasons , including misalignment of the voltage leads and/or leakage between the leads .",
    "the offset voltage is measured before each measurement and the magnetic field value is determined by subtracting this offset signal from the measured hall signal .",
    "the magnetic field resolution is limited by the noise in the output signal .",
    "the noise depends on the active area of the probe and is larger for a smaller probe . in order to obtain understanding of the sensitivity limitations of our microscope",
    "let us compare the observed noise level to the johnson - nyquist thermal noise which limits the sensitivity of measurements @xcite : @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 is the temperature and @xmath40 is the resistance of the hall sensor . at room temperature ( @xmath39 = 300 k ) , using @xmath40 = 120 k@xmath25 ( maximum contact resistance for the smallest probe , including the series resistance 100 k@xmath25 ) , @xmath41 1.424 nv/@xmath42hz . for excitation current of 10 @xmath2a ,",
    "this gives a lowest possible noise in @xmath34 of @xmath43 1 @xmath2t/@xmath42hz , or a magnetic field sensitivity of 10 @xmath2 t ( at measurement frequency 522 hz and time constant 10 ms ) .",
    "however , the magnetic field resolution in our measurements is @xmath6 100 @xmath2 t .",
    "thus additional noise sources other than the johnson noise are at the origin of this field resolution .",
    "a noise floor of @xmath6 16 nv/@xmath42hz is measured when the hall probe is not excited .",
    "it increases to @xmath6 18 nv/@xmath42hz when the probe is excited .",
    "the measured noise level is thus essentially due to the wiring of the probe , capturing ambient electrical noise , as the microscope operates in an unshielded environment .",
    "the field sensitivity in our system is in between values reported for shpm systems operating at room temperature ( 300 k ) : 0.08 @xmath2t/@xmath42hz in ref .",

    "( gaas / algaas hall probes ) .        for proper interpretation of experimental data , it is important to reliably estimate the distance between the hall cross and the sample surface . to avoid contact of the wires micro - bonded to the hall probe with the sample surface and for safety of the probe against damage by hitting the sample surface ,",
    "the probe is kept at a slight inclination w.r.t . the sample stage .",
    "figures [ f4](e ) and [ f4](f ) show side and front views , respectively , of a probe mounted on a tuning fork with a sample below , indicating the angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 the probe makes with the sample surface .",

    "the angle @xmath44 ensures that the probe does not hit the sample surface and the angle @xmath45 ensures that the edge of the hall bar closer to the hall cross touches the sample surface .",
    "the angle @xmath44 is generally set at @xmath6 9 - 10@xmath46 ( @xmath33 0.5@xmath46 , measured optically ) , which is small enough to assume that the measured signal the component of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the sample surface @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath47 5@xmath46 is usually good enough to ensure that the micro - bonded wires do not touch the sample surface .",
    "however , a larger angle is needed for safety of the probe itself .",
    "since the hall cross is rather close to the edge of the hall bar , scanning over large areas of samples with large topographic variations leads to significant bruising of the probe .",
    "while scanning with a smaller angle @xmath44 , in a number of probes , the contact closest to the edge got disconnected due to scratches induced during scanning , rendering the probe unusable .",

    "further , the @xmath56 profiles show that the field modulation effect of the pillars completely disappears beyond @xmath61 0.1 mm , where all the profiles merge into the profile expected for the bulk magnet only .",
    "we have characterized hard magnetic powder ( ndfeb ) based micro - flux sources prepared using the micro - magnetic imprinting ( @xmath2mi ) technique @xcite .",
    "more details on the @xmath2mi technique and preparation and characterization of micro - flux sources by this method can be found in ref . .",

    "( c ) @xmath56 profiles at different locations on the image as indicated by numbers in ( a).,width=6 ]      a shpm system is a potentially attractive tool for characterization of bulk magnets , as on one hand it can detect large magnetic fields , and on the other hand , it can reveal local inhomogeneities that could affect the magnet performance .",
    "our setup has been utilized for characterization of a number of mm sized bulk magnets .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows a summary of measurements on a cubic magnet ( 5 mm side length ) .",
    "shpm images in figures [ f8](a ) and [ f8](b ) show the @xmath34 distribution across a 2 mm @xmath7 2 mm area centered near the center of the magnet , at scan height @xmath48 = 100 @xmath2 m and 500 @xmath2 m ( @xmath33 1 @xmath2 m ) , respectively . note that these mentioned heights are the heights of the probe from the sample surface at the location @xmath63 , i.e. , the top - left of the image .",
    "the actual height at each point would vary according to the roughness of the magnet surface as in these sets the scans are performed in smooth horizontal planes ( in flyover mode , using an artificial flat topography for reference ) .",
    "this ensures surface corrugations do not affect the measured @xmath34 profiles .",
    "the scan resolution is 2.5 @xmath2 m ( image area 800 @xmath7 800 pixel ) .",
    "figure [ f8](a ) demonstrates inhomogeneities in the magnetic field distribution across the surface of the bulk magnet .",
    "the @xmath34 value is seen to vary in the large range of 360 mt @xmath64 540 mt over the image area .",
    "moreover , pockets of low @xmath34 ( e.g. , cf .",
    "dark blue region labelled 2 in figure [ f8](a ) ) are observed .",
    "these observations are useful because these bulk magnets are used for a variety of purposes , e.g. , to magnetize the soft magnetic microstructures discussed in section [ subsecfecopillars ] . in view of the inhomogeneous @xmath34 distribution over the magnet surface ,",
    "when such bulk magnets are used to characterize flux concentration in soft micro - magnets , it becomes important to take care in choosing the region of the surface onto which the micro - magnet array is placed .",
    "however , the image in figure [ f8](b ) at a larger height of 500 @xmath2 m from the magnet surface shows that the @xmath34 distribution is largely smoothened out at this height from the magnet surface .",
    "this means at these heights , the issue of magnetic field inhomogeneity is not as crucial as in the earlier case .",
    "this is further clarified from local @xmath56 profiles at different locations on the magnet .",
    "figure [ f8](c ) shows @xmath56 profiles obtained at five different locations on the image as indicated by the numbers in figure [ f8](a ) .",
    "interestingly , while the profiles at the corners ( locations 1 , 3 and 4 ) and center of the image ( location 5 ) show expected monotonic decrease in @xmath34 with increasing @xmath3 , in the profile at the center of the low @xmath34 region ( location 2 ) , the @xmath34 value initially increases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this continues till @xmath61 0.4 mm , beyond which the curve reverses and follows the same trend as the others . with increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the difference in local @xmath34 values at different locations decreases .",
    "this is because the detected localfield really is an average of field lines emanating from the area surrounding a given location . with increasing @xmath3 , the area over which the averaging occurs increases , and hence local anomaliesare averaged out . in general at a distance of @xmath6 1 - 2 mm",
    "the @xmath34 distribution becomes homogeneous over an image size corresponding to the height , though there is still noticeable difference between the local @xmath34 values even at heights as large as 5 mm ( cf .",
    "figure [ f8 ] ) . beyond @xmath61 10 mm ,",
    "all the curves merge into a single one , indicating uniform @xmath56 across the magnet surface over the 2 mm @xmath7 2 mm area at these heights .",
    "note that in both images in figures [ f8](a ) and [ f8](b ) , there is an overall gradient in the @xmath34 distribution along the @xmath1-direction ( top - to - bottom of the images ) .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the hall probe is kept at a tilt of @xmath47 10@xmath46 w.r.t .",
    "the sample surface , the angle  being in the @xmath65-plane .",
    "hence the effective measured component of @xmath34 changes as the probe is scanned along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "another factor contributing to this gradient could be that the scan area of 2 @xmath7 2 mm was not exactly centered at the middle of the magnet .",
    "note that there is no such gradient along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "this issue is particularly noticeable in this case due to the intense fields and large area of the magnet . in usual scenarios of smaller sized micro - magnet samples",
    "this can be ignored , as seen in sections [ subsecfecopillars ] and [ subsecumi ] .",
    "we have developed a scanning hall probe microscope capable of performing high resolution scans ( step size of 0.1 @xmath2 m ) over large areas ( few mm , limited by sample topography and tilt ) .",
    "new generation of mesa etched and precision diced hall sensors enable approaching close to the sample surface ( @xmath4 2 @xmath2 m ) resulting in images with highly resolved features ( spatial resolution of magnetic field distribution limited by the size of hall probes , 1 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "these hall probes allow detection of large magnetic fields ( @xmath6 1 t ) with high field resolution ( 100 @xmath2 t , limited by system noise during scanning ) .",
    "the afm - like tuning fork based force detection technique enables imaging in regulation mode ( probe in contact with the sample surface ) and the microscope can be also used for imaging in flyover mode at variable heights from the sample surface ( up to 35 mm ) .",
    "apart from scanning , the system is capable of recording local @xmath5 profiles . a single instrument ( the zurich instruments hf2li lockin amplifier ) serves as the primary electronics component of the microscope which significantly improves system performance .",
    "new programs have been developed for reliable operation and several enhanced functionalities such as precise sensor calibration , more efficient scanning in sets , fast acquisition of @xmath5 profiles etc .",
    "the simple design , three large range , precise stepper motors and a simple piezo stack combined with a reliable tuning fork based height control makes this microscope a very versatile tool for the control and inspection of devices and materials .",
    "the setup is being extensively used to measure stray field patterns of micro - magnet arrays as well as for characterization of bulk magnets .",
