    "the study of nucleon - nucleon inelastic collisions provides a powerful tool to deepen our insight into the properties of nucleon - nucleon interactions and baryonic resonances .",
    "a large amount of theoretical work on threshold meson production has been performed over the last years @xcite , stimulated by the precise data obtained at iucf , celsius and cosy @xcite .",
    "on the other side , double pion production reactions in the nucleon , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , have proved to be essential as a test of chiral perturbation theory @xcite and as a source of information about @xmath1 and @xmath6 @xcite . in this context , the still scantily explored two pion production channel in the collisions of nucleons and light nuclei appears as promising research area .    most of the work , both experimental and theoretical , on two pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions was performed in the seventies and in connection with the abc effect .",
    "the abc anomaly is an enhancement in the missing mass spectra close to the @xmath7 production threshold , observed for the reactions @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "although any interpretation of the abc as a resonance is excluded @xcite , the origin of it is still poorly understood @xcite . an important step towards the understanding of the abc effect has been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath11 spectra from the @xmath10 reaction at a deuteron beam energy of 1250 mev @xcite has been explained assuming that pions are independently produced in reactions involving two different pairs of nucleons from the projectile and target deuterons .",
    "nowadays , two pion production in @xmath12 collisions is being studied experimentally at celsius for beam kinetic energies between 650 and 775 mev . on the theoretical side , a microscopic model for the @xmath13 reaction",
    "has been recently developed @xcite .",
    "it includes mechanisms with the excitation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances , as well as some non - resonant contributions , and gives a satisfactory description of the available experimental data on total cross sections for most of the channels and in a wide range of energies up to 800 mev above threshold .    in this letter ,",
    "i focus the attention on the deuteron spectrum in @xmath0 measured by hollas and collaborators @xcite using a nearly monokinetic neutron beam with central momentum @xmath16 gev .",
    "this experiment is somewhat similar to the one of plouin et al .",
    "@xcite , but at lower energies ( @xmath17 mev in @xcite vs @xmath18 mev in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the analysis is simpler since , once the @xmath19 peaks are subtracted , only the double pion production mechanism is present . apart from that ,",
    "one expects that , being closer to threshold , the reaction mechanism might be simpler .",
    "the abc peaks are not present in the data ; they rather show a well defined bump at high @xmath7 missing masses , in disagreement with the models available in the literature @xcite . from this comparison ,",
    "the authors concluded @xcite that neither double-@xmath15 formation nor double - nucleon exchange provides the appropriate description of the reaction at @xmath20 gev .",
    "a similar enhancement has also been observed for the reaction @xmath21 , which is being studied using a beam of protons from cosy ( momo experiment ) @xcite , at a q value close to the one of the experiment by hollas et al .",
    "these common features point to a common dynamical description .    here",
    ", it is shown that the deuteron spectra for @xmath0 at @xmath20 gev can be understood as a consequence of the interference of two mechanisms involving the excitation of the roper resonance @xmath1 and its subsequent decay into @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the implications of this finding to the momo experiment are also discussed .",
    "the model is schematically presented in fig .",
    "it is a reduced version of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , modified for the case where one has a deuteron instead of two free nucleons in the final state .",
    "the choice of the mechanisms was based on their contribution to the total cross section for the @xmath22 reaction ; the situation for the @xmath23 channel is similar . at @xmath24 mev ,",
    "the mechanism with @xmath25 gives @xmath26 , being by far the most important .",
    "the second largest contribution comes from @xmath27 with @xmath28 ; as we will see , in the case of a deuteron in the final state , its contribution is larger with respect to the dominant @xmath25 and crucial to obtain the right shape .",
    "all other mechanisms give @xmath29 ; i do not include them all , but just the double-@xmath15 ( @xmath30 ) one in order to make contact with the model of ref .",

    "the deuteron momentum spectrum is the sum of the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 contributions . in the laboratory frame ,",

    "for the neutral pions channel , the expression is the same but with and extra @xmath41 factor , which is a consequence of having two identical pions in the final state .",
    "the difference of masses between charged and neutral pions is taken into account for the phase space , but isospin symmetry is assumed in the calculation of the amplitude .    the amplitude can be expressed as    [ eq2 ] & _ r r_1 r_2= _ r_1 r_2 ( r_1 r_2 | .",

    "the partial decay @xmath81 practically accounts for the total delta width . in the case of the roper ,",
    "the major part of the width comes from the decay into nucleon and pion and the rest from the decay into nucleon and two pions .",
    "all of them , except the small ( less than 8@xmath65 at the @xmath14 peak ) @xmath82 decay , can be calculated with the lagrangians given above .",
    "finally , let us consider @xmath50 . for the @xmath83 potential ,",
    "i calculate the diagrams assuming a pion exchange and make the substitution    [ eq9 ] d^()_t=1 ( q ) q_i q_j v_l ( q ) _ i _ j + v_t ( q ) ( _ ij - _ i _ j ) so that @xmath84 includes the longitudinal pion exchange , the transversal rho exchange , and the short range correlations that take into account the repulsive force at short distances .",
    "functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 are described elsewhere @xcite . with respect to the @xmath87 channel , in a recent analysis @xcite of the @xmath88 reaction on a proton target ,",
    "the strength of the isoscalar @xmath89 transition was extracted by parameterizing the transition amplitude in terms of an effective `` @xmath90 '' which couples to @xmath91 as the bonn model @xmath90 ( @xmath92 ) @xcite and couples to @xmath93 with an unknown strength provided by a best fit to the data ( @xmath94 ) . according to the fit , @xmath95 and @xmath96 have the same sign .",
    "therefore , we have    [ eq10 ] d_t=0 ( q ) = ( ) ^2 , where an equal @xmath97 gev for the form factor is assumed for both vertices .",
    "the explicit expressions for the amplitudes are too involved to be reproduced here , but some details of their evaluation can be traced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all the amplitudes for the free reaction @xmath98 are given in the appendix .",
    "with the ingredients described in the previous section , one can calculate the deuteron spectra at @xmath20 gev for different angles .",
    "the results are shown in fig . [ all ] .",
    "they compare quite well with the data of hollas et al .",
    "@xcite , and certainly much better than the previous models @xcite .",
    "the curves , in general , underestimate the data , maybe because there are many other mechanisms , not considered for the sake of simplicity , that , even been individually small , could in sum enhance the cross section .",
    "some of the approximations made , like the neglect of the deuteron d - wave and non - relativistic approximation in the vertices , as well as the intrinsic uncertainties of the mechanisms included can also be a source of discrepancies ; they are discussed below .",
    "the large data point at the edges of the spectra show the contamination of the @xmath19 peaks @xcite .",
    "i have also estimated the influence of the width of the neutron beam by averaging the double differential cross sections over a breit - wigner profile of 40 mev width and centered at @xmath20 gev @xcite ; the contribution of this effect is very small and irrelevant for our study .",
    "the plotted curves are obtained using the deuteron wave function derived from the paris potential @xcite ; with the bonn wave functions @xcite the results are very similar , while for the hulthen one @xcite the distributions are overall larger , up to a factor two at the position of the central bump .    the mechanism @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ diag]a ) produces spectra very similar to phase space ; its contribution is certainly the largest , but its relative size with respect to the @xmath27 mechanism is not as large as one would naively expect from estimations based on the total cross sections obtained for both mechanisms in the free @xmath13 reaction .",
    "nevertheless , it is not surprising since here we are sensitive only to a reduced phase space region and choosing a particular combination of the quantum numbers of the outgoing nucleons ( those of the deuteron ) . for this mechanism ,",
    "i have calculated the contribution of the d - wave part of the deuteron wave function and found it negligible .",
    "the @xmath27 mechanism ( fig . [ diag]b ) exhibits a wide bump at the center of the spectra ( high @xmath7 masses ) , whose maximum falls fast with the increase of the deuteron angle , and small peaks at the edges of the spectra ( low @xmath7 masses ) ; the size of these peaks does not vary appreciably with the angle .",
    "this mechanism plays a crucial role in providing the right shape to the distributions through its interference with the larger @xmath13 contribution .",
    "this interference is constructive at high @xmath7 masses and destructive at low ones .",
    "such pattern can be understood by realizing that the @xmath27 amplitude is dominated by terms proportional to the scalar product of the outgoing pions three momenta ; this scalar product has different signs in the center of the spectra , where the pions go back to back , and at the edges , where they travel together . in order to further illustrate the effect of the interference , fig .",
    "[ signo ] shows the effect of changing the relative sign of the two amplitudes .",
    "the data clearly favor a choice of the sign of @xmath99 in agreement with earlier works @xcite .",
    "the double-@xmath15 mechanism ( fig . [ diag ] ) is so small that it can hardly be distinguished in fig .",
    "[ all ] . in fig .",
    "[ deldel ] , the contribution of this mechanism alone is shown for @xmath100 gev , @xmath101 and using the hulthen wave function , in order to compare with the result of bar - nir , risser and shuster ( fig .",
    "4 b of ref .",
    "the differential cross section obtained in the case of only pion exchange is very similar to the one given by the relativistic model of ref .",
    "@xcite ; the inclusion of the rho exchange modifies the result , and the short range correlations between the initial nucleons cause a strong reduction of the strength of this mechanism . at @xmath102 mev ( @xmath103 gev ) , the @xmath104 and @xmath105 reactions",
    "are probably dominated by the double-@xmath15 mechanism ; therefore , the future data from celsius would provide an excellent opportunity to study the interplay of the described ingredients and , in particular , the role of the short range correlations .    wherever dealing with the roper resonance ,",
    "the lack of a precise determination of its properties is a problem that should be faced . in fig .",
    "[ comb ] , i investigate how the results vary with some of the uncertainties .",
    "as can be noticed , the shape is not affected by these changes , but some set of values are preferred .",
    "[ comb ] a , shows how the spectrum changes with the modification of @xmath71 , @xmath72 within the previously accepted values , while keeping the total width and the partial branching ratios fixed ; set ii gives a better agreement with the data . in fig [ comb ]",
    "b , we show the range of uncertainties that come from the variation of the total width of the @xmath14 in the limits given by the particle data book @xcite , that is from 250 mev ( lower line ) to 450 mev ( upper line ) . finally , the dependence on the partial branchings of the @xmath14 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the total width fixed to 350 mev , is studied in fig .",
    "[ comb ] c. the dashed line corresponds to a @xmath106 branching of @xmath14 to @xmath2 and a @xmath107 to @xmath3 , while for the dash - dotted one , a larger @xmath108 of @xmath2 and a smaller @xmath109 of @xmath3 ; the data prefer the latter choice .",
    "these data alone do not allow to disentangle the different effects , but , in combination with other data that will be available in the future ( like the data on @xmath105 at @xmath110 mev from celsius ) , would be an important source of information about the roper resonance .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the present model could provide an explanation to the deviation from phase space observed in the two pion invariant mass distribution of the reaction @xmath21 , studied with a proton beam of momentum @xmath111 gev @xcite .",
    "this experimental result has been interpreted with the hypothesis that the pions are preferably emitted in p - wave @xcite .",
    "an ansatz based on this idea can explain the data reasonably well but , unfortunately , the initial tail of the @xmath112 meson produced via @xmath113 can hardly produce the required strength . in fig .",
    "[ dsdt ] , we show the same observable for the reaction @xmath114 ; the shape obtained for the charged pions channel is very similar to the one observed at cosy .",
    "the neutral pion channel , though , exhibits a shape similar to the one of the charged pions , and only a factor about 1/2 smaller at the peak position , in apparent contradiction with the much smaller rate of @xmath19 pairs , compared to the charged ones , obtained in the momo experiment .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that , in the present model , the pions are almost always produced in s - wave .",
    "however , we should bear in mind that the interference pattern can be very different when the nucleons are bound in a @xmath115 nucleus instead of a deuteron .",
    "detailed calculations are , therefore , required to check if the model can explain the momo experiment .",
    "in summary , a simple model for the @xmath0 reaction has been developed , based on a previous model for the free @xmath13 and including the most important resonance contributions .",
    "it is shown that the bump in the center of the deuteron momentum spectra ( high @xmath7 masses ) observed at a neutron beam momentum of @xmath16 gev ( @xmath116 mev ) can be explained as a result of the interference of two mechanisms involving the excitation of the roper resonance : the dominant and phase - space like @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ diag ] a ) and the smaller in size @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ diag ] b ) , but determinant to obtain the right profile .",
    "the mechanism of double-@xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ diag ] c ) excitation , considered in an earlier model for the same reaction , but only including pion exchange , is significantly reduced by the short range correlations .",
    "other two pion production reactions like @xmath104 and @xmath105 , currently studied experimentally at celsius for energies between 650 and 775 mev , would be helpful to clarify this issue , the size of the spectra depends appreciably on the roper resonance and can be used , together with other two pion production reactions , to learn more about this resonance and its decay properties .",
    "finally , the present model could be helpful to understand the two - pion invariant mass distributions observed from @xmath21 at cosy .",
