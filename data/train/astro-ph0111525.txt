    "star formation is a driving force behind galaxy evolution ; it largely determines the stellar , energy ( radiant and mechanical ) , metal , and dust content of a galaxy . throughout much of the history of the universe ,",
    "a significant fraction of the galaxy population is represented by galaxies undergoing intense star formation activity ; at redshift z@xmath01 the star formation rate per unit comoving volume was roughly an order of magnitude higher than at present times ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al .  1996",
    "; cowie , songaila & barger 1999 ) . yet",
    ", a number of questions related to the evolution of intense star formation episodes remain unresolved . among them : ( 1 ) the duration , duty cycle , and star formation history of starbursts ; ( 2 ) the importance of self - triggering and propagation for the evolution of the starburst ( e.g. , walborn et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( 3 ) the impact of starbursts on the host galaxy s ism and the feedback onto the evolution of the starburst itself ; and ( 4 ) the possibility of distinct cluster and diffuse field star formation modes ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in order to begin addressing these issues",
    ", we are undertaking a comprehensive study of @xmath120 nearby ( @xmath220 mpc ) starburst galaxies covering a representative range of characteristics : morphological types ranging from dwarf irregulars ( he  2 - 10 ) to grand - design spirals ( m83 ) ; starburst star formation rates ( sfr ) from 0.1  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 to 5  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 ; metallicities from 1/13  z@xmath3 to 2  z@xmath3 ; and dust attenuations in the range 0@xmath5a@xmath63 .",
    "the data that are being collected for this study include hst ultraviolet and optical imaging in broad and narrow  band filters of the stellar continuum and selected nebular emission lines ( typically h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 for dust reddening corrections and for tracing the ionized gas , [ oiii](5007   ) and [ sii](6731   ) for mapping of photo and shock  ionized gas ) , ground  based optical imaging , and hst uv spectroscopy . in this contribution , we concentrate on the galaxy pair ngc5253ngc5236 , for which almost all needed data are available and the analysis is almost completed .",
    "the two galaxies form an interesting , complementary pair in the centaurus group : ngc5253 is a dwarf galaxy that is about 10 times more metal poor ( @xmath11/5  z@xmath3 ) and about 100 times less massive ( @xmath910@xmath10  m@xmath3 ) than its grand - design spiral companion ngc5236 ( m83 ) .",
    "the projected distance between the two galaxies is @xmath1130  kpc , and a close encounter between the two about 12  gyr ago has been suggested as the initial trigger of the star formation in ngc5253 ( rogstad , lockhart & wright 1974 ; van den bergh 1980 ; caldwell & phillips 1989 ) . despite the dissimilarities of the host galaxies , the central starbursts",
    "share some common properties : both have a sfr@xmath10.2  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 over an area of @xmath1400  pc in size ; and both are characterized by patchy dust obscuration , with relatively transparent regions counterbalanced by highly opaque areas and dust lanes .",
    "however , while in ngc5253 star formation is diffused throughout the central region ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) , in ngc5236 star formation is concentrated in a semi ",
    "annulus centered on the optical nucleus , and has possibly been triggered by the galaxy s bar ( thatte et al .",
    "2000 ; harris et al .",
    "2001 ) .    located at a distance of about 4  mpc ( sandage et al .  1994 )",
    ", the two galaxies were imaged with the hst wfpc2 from the uv to the i - band ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 , harris et al .",
    "2001 ) , yielding a resolution of @xmath112  pc per pixel , which is comparable to the typical half - light radius of stellar clusters .",
    "the uv  v  i colors of the central galaxies regions , combined with the h@xmath8 emission map , were used to constrain the ages of the stellar populations , while h@xmath8/h@xmath7 ratio maps were used to remove the effects of dust reddening from the colors and luminosities .",
    "hst stis long - slit uv spectra of the central region of ngc5253 were used to analyze in detail the characteristics of the hot star populations in this galaxy ( tremonti et al .",

    "1997 ; and figure  1 ) .",
    "the region contains about a dozen uv - bright stellar clusters , as well as diffusely distributed blue stars ( meurer et al .",
    "radio observations , however , indicate that the bulk of the most recent star formation is hidden by dust ( turner , ho & beck 1998 ; turner , beck & ho 2000 ) . the distribution of the uv emission is slightly elongated along the major axis , and is markedly different from the morphology of the ionized gas emission ( h@xmath8 ) ; the latter is circularly symmetric about a bright stellar cluster close to the geometric center of the galaxy ( ngc52535 of calzetti et al .  1997 ,",

    "is located in an area 5060  pc in size right north of the dust lane , centered on ngc5253 - 5 ( figure  1 ) .",

    "1996 ) ; observations at radio wavelengths have revealed the presence of a dusty ` supernebula ' in the area , possibly the youngest globular cluster known ( turner , beck & ho 2000 ) .",
    "although this is the most active region in the starburst , with a sfr@xmath120  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , it is not the uv - brightest : the area of peak activity is indeed rather dusty , likely still embedded in the parental molecular cloud with a@xmath14935  mag .",
    "the bulk of the observed uv emission is emerging from the less active , relatively unextincted surrounding region , extending out to @xmath1200  pc in radius .",
    "this is the region where star formation has been going on at a relatively constant pace for @xmath1100200  myr , at the modest rate of 0.2  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "apart for some evidence that star formation may be concentrating toward the center , thus moving inward , there is no other sign of a _ spatial _ evolution of the starburst in this galaxy .",
    "( left ) a view of the ngc5253 emission collected by the stis long slit , along the spatial direction .",

    "+ ( right ) the average cluster uv spectrum is compared with the average field uv spectrum .",
    "the two are markedly different ; in particular the spectrum of the field lacks broad  line profiles in nv(1240   ) , siiv(1400   ) , and civ(1550   ) .",
    "this difference excludes scattered cluster light as source of the diffuse uv light ( see the text and tremonti et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion of the nature of the diffuse light ) .",
    "the long - slit of stis was used to target a number of stellar clusters and the intracluster uv light in the center of ngc5253 , and spectra in the wavelength range 11501700     were obtained ( figure  1 and tremonti et al .",
    "eight clusters fall within the stis slit ( figure  3 ) , while the diffuse light ( marked as ` fields ' in figure  3 ) covers a region of @xmath1220@xmath151.9  pc@xmath16 in total .",
    "the eight clusters have ages between 1  myr and 8  myr , and masses between a few 100  m@xmath3 and 4@xmath1510@xmath17  m@xmath3 .",
    "the mass of cluster ngc5253 - 5 is highly uncertain , depending on uncertain dust corrections , and could be as high as 6@xmath1510@xmath18  m@xmath3 ; possibly , the cluster coincides with the ` supernebula ' detected in the radio by turner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the uv spectrum of the field is markedly different from the average spectrum of the stellar clusters , in that it lacks the broad  line profiles of nv , siiv , and civ , characteristic of o - star winds ( figure  4 ) .",
    "the diffuse uv light makes up between 50% and 80% of the total uv emission from local starburst galaxies ( buat et al .",
    "1994 ; meurer et al .  1995 ; maoz et al .",
    "1996 ) ; it has been suggested to originate from a mode of star formation that is separate from that of stellar clusters ( meurer et al .",
    "comparison of the stis uv spectra of the field with models indicate that , if the field population is produced by a separate mode of star formation from that of the clusters , this implies also a different imf between the two .",
    "in particular , while the stellar clusters are compatible with a salpeter ( @xmath8=2.35 ) imf in the range 1100  m@xmath3 , the field population needs either a steeper - than - salpeter imf slope ( @xmath193.5 ) or a standard imf slope with an upper mass cut - off at 30  m@xmath3 ( tremonti et al .",
    "steep imf slopes have been found also for the field stars of the smc and lmc , although the values are more extreme , @xmath195 , than those derived for ngc5253 ( massey et al .",
    "an alternative scenario to bimodal star formation is that of dissolving clusters . the field uv spectrum ( figure  4 ) is well modelled by a constant star formation synthetic spectrum from which the young stars ( younger than 10  myr ) contribution has been subtracted .",
    "this ` aged ' constant model can easily account for the absence of the broad lines in nv , siiv , and civ , because the o  stars have been removed from it .",
    "according to this model , the lack of massive stars in the field is due to the lack of young stars .",
    "the clusters for which ages have been derived , either from spectroscopy or photometry , are typically younger than 1020  myr . if these are representative of the clusters population in the starburst , clusters are generally younger than the field s stars .",
    "thus , it is possible that _ all stars form in clusters _ , the clusters dissolve over a timescale of @xmath110  myr and their surviving stars disperse into the field .",
    "models on the dissolution of compact stellar clusters in the center of galaxies ( kim , morris & lee 1999 ) predict that a 5@xmath1510@xmath20  m@xmath3 in ngc5253 evaporates in @xmath11520  myr .",
    "this dissolution timescale is in the required ballpark to make the scenario consistent with the measured ages of ngc5253 s clusters .",
    "the starburst in m83 is harbored in a morphologically and dynamically complex central region ( figure  5 ) . located within the main bar of the galaxy ,",
    "the center of m83 appears to contain a well - defined nuclear subsystem .",
    "the bright optical nucleus is offset from the center of the outer isophotes opposite to the starburst semi - annulus ( gallais et al .",
    "1991 ) , and a nuclear bar may separate the bright nucleus from the center ( elmegreen , chromey & warren 1998 ) .",
    "the possible double nucleus suggests that another galaxy merged with m83 in the past ; the merging event , together with the galaxy s bar , is a potential trigger of the current central starburst .",
    "dense molecular gas is concentrated to the north of the starburst semi - annulus ( israel & baas 2001 ) , perhaps a result of material collecting around an inner lindblad resonance , as suggested by gallais et al .",
    "this cold material may be feeding the central starburst ( petitpas & wilson 1998 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) at the appropriate metallicity for the galaxy ; representative model ages are marked .",
    "the starburst itself , in addition to be of comparable intensity to the event in ngc5253 , is bright at all wavelengths , from the x - ray ( ehle et al .",
    "1998 ) , through the uv ( kinney et al .  1993 ) , optical and near  ir ( gallais et al .  1991",
    "; rouan et al .",
    "1996 ) , through the mid  ir ( telesco et al .",
    "1993 ) , to the radio ( turner & ho 1994 ) .",
    "multiple dust lanes cross the center of this metal  rich galaxy , although dust is very patchy , as demonstrated by the uv  brightness of the starburst semi - annulus ( figure  5 ) .",
    "two bright mid  ir sources , possibly two very young knots of star formation , are located at the nw edge of the starburst annulus , close to and/or embedded in a major dust lane ( telesco et al .",
    "the uv  bright region of star formation breaks down into almost 400 clusters brighter than m@xmath21=18  mag ( harris et al .",
    "2001 ) , while diffuse light represents more than 20% of the total uv emission .",

    "an analysis of the colors and ew(h@xmath8 ) of the uv  bright population in m83 , analogous to that performed for ngc5253 ( see previous section ) , reveals that star formation has been continuous for the past @xmath90.11  gyr ( figure  6 ) .",
    "this is not dissimilar to what found in ngc5253 , although a larger fraction of the population in m83 contains stars older than @xmath1500  myr ( harris et al .",

    "+ ( right ) a map of the cluster positions in m83 ; each cluster is marked by its age .",
    "the grey contours trace the v  band image and the position of the bright optical nucleus is indicated by a cross .    among the @xmath1400 clusters detected in the uv with wfpc2 , 45 are bright enough to be detected also in the shallower v and i images , enabling a study of their age and mass distributions ( harris et al .",
    "again , colors and ew(h@xmath8 ) were used as complementary diagnostics for the age of the stellar clusters ( figure  7 ) .",
    "the basic result is that about 75% of the clusters more massive than 2@xmath1510@xmath17  m@xmath3 ( our low mass completeness limit ) are younger than 10  myr , and almost 50% are in the narrow age range 57  myr .",
    "no cluster older than @xmath150  myr was detected , although our images are deep enough for the purpose .",
    "while the 57  myr old clusters are distributed across the semi - annulus of star formation , clusters younger than 5  myr are preferentially located at the edges of the annulus ( figure  8) .",
    "this suggests that star formation has propagated from the interior of the annulus to its perimeter .",
    "the 57  myr population has possibly evacuated interstellar material from most of the semi - annulus , and star formation is continuing along the edges , as also evidenced by the h@xmath8 morphology .    along the semi - annulus ,",
    "there is a trend for older clusters ( ages around 1030  myr , figure  8) to be located in the southern - most region , where the largest of the h@xmath8 bubbles is also located ; whereas the peak of the current star formation is in the north - west area of the semi - annulus , close to a major dust lane and to the two mid - ir peaks ( telesco et al .",
    "this age sequence supports earlier suggestions that star formation has been propagating along the semi - annulus from the south to the north ( gallais et al .",
    "1991 ; puxley et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the full mass range for our clusters is @xmath110@xmath208@xmath1510@xmath17  m@xmath3 , and clusters more massive than a few times 10@xmath17  m@xmath3 are not expected to evaporate on timescales shorter than a few tens of myr .",
    "thus , the peak in the number of 57  myr old clusters may suggest a true burst of activity in the recent past of the galaxy . this is consistent with evolution models already developed for the center of m83 ( gallais et al .",
    "1991 , thatte et al .",
    "2000 ) : molecular gas is fed to the center by the main bar , and once enough mass is accumulated , star formation occurs .",
    "typical sizes of the clouds would imply burst durations of 1030  myr ( efremov & elmegreen 1998 ) .",
    "possibly , the current burst is a transitory flare - up of circum - nuclear star formation , but if gas feeding of the center by the bar is recurrent or continuous , so would be the bursts of star formation .",
    "the absence of clusters older than 50  myr in our images would suggest inter - burst periods @xmath2250  myr .    a more accurate understanding of the star formation history in the center of m83 is currently hampered by our limitations in pinning down the nature of the diffuse uv light .",
    "this is mainly driven by the lack of uv spectroscopic data .",
    "for instance , if the uv spectra were to indicate that the diffuse population is mainly constituted of stars older than @xmath950  myr , this would reinforce the case for a true starburst nature of the 57  myr old cluster population .",
    "a diffuse population containing signatures of young o  stars would support a bimodal star formation scenario ( in contrast with ngc5253 ) .",
    "presence of field stars in the 1050  myr age range would re - open the question of whether the current starburst is a ` true burst ' or simply part of a long duty - cycle event , because the scarcity of clusters older than @xmath110  myr could be ascribed to evaporation .",
    "preliminary results from the starburst star formation history project indicate that the morphological differences between the starbursts in the dwarf ngc5253 and in the massive spiral m83 may reflect differences in their history as well .",
    "in particular , the starburst in ngc5253 appears to be part of a time - extended ( @xmath22100  myr ) event , while the starburst in m83 could be a ` true ' burst of star formation , a short flare - up that could be separated from the next one by more than 50  myr .",
    "the latter scenario is still under investigation , and uv spectroscopy will provide a final answer .",
