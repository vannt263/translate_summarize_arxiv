    "the flux reaching the surface of the earth is about 10,000  @xmath0/(min m@xmath1 ) and the mean muon energy is 3 - 4  gev . since muons are heavy particles and do not undergo nuclear interactions , they are highly penetrating in matter and their average energy is sufficient to penetrate tens of meters of rock .",

    "in addition , considering that the entire volume of the building is continuously crossed by the flux of the cosmic ray radiation , with directions spanning several tens of degrees from the zenith , a more complex system of muon detectors distributed in different positions of the building may allow a global and simultaneous stability monitoring of the building to be performed .    limiting features of the cosmic ray radiation are the stochastic nature of the deviations of the muon trajectories , due to angular scattering suffered in crossing materials , and the rather low rate of events when detectors of reasonable size are employed .",
    "the former feature imposes the use of statistical distributions to extract the measured quantities by statistical inference and , consequently , needs the collection of sufficiently large number of events to obtain adequate measurement precisions .",

    "in  @xcite cosmic ray muon detection techniques were assessed for applications in civil and industrial engineering aimed at the monitoring of alignment and stability of large civil and mechanical structures .",

    "the described set - up was modeled in a monte carlo simulation based on the geant4 toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter  @xcite , taking into account the geometry of the press structure and the detector telescope . a realistic cosmic ray generator based on experimental data",
    "was implemented in the code in order to simulate , as realistically as possible , the momentum , angular distributions and other features of the cosmic ray radiation at the earth surface .",
    "extensive monte carlo simulations of the tracking of cosmic rays through the simulated set - up allowed the expected measurement uncertainty for the monitoring of the mechanical press alignment to be assessed .",
    "in addition , its dependence on the system geometry , presence of interposed materials between the detectors , intrinsic resolution of the detectors and elapsed time available for the measurement was determined .    in particular , the position of the middle detector ( relative to the other two ) was determined by recording the hitting positions of cosmic ray muons crossing the whole telescope and performing an appropriate statistical analysis of the simulated data . in a fixed geometrical configuration ,",
    "the standard uncertainty on the measurement of the possible misalignment of the middle detector is mainly connected to the number of events of crossing muons registered by the telescope , which is linearly proportional to the time available for the data taking .    as an example of the obtained results ,",
    "supposing a calibration time of one week , necessary to establish the reference position of the middle detector with a measurement standard uncertainty of about 85  @xmath0 m , the system should be able to detect a relative displacement of 1.0  mm in about 12  h of data taking , whereas 60  h are needed to detect a 0.5  mm displacement at 99.85% level of significance .",
    "factors affecting the system resolution performances are the telescope geometry ( detector sensitive surface and detector distances ) , which is connected with the solid angle for cosmic ray acceptance , and the thickness and position of layers of materials interposed among the detectors , which determines the amount of deviations due to multiple scattering of the muons crossing the telescope .",
    "detector intrinsic spatial resolution , on the contrary , does not seem to be a crucial parameter",
    ".    this method could be particularly useful when the parts that have to be monitored are not reciprocally visible .",
    "in addition , it makes use of a natural form of radiation , ubiquitously present on the entire earth surface , without need of artificial sources and radiological protection means .",
    "the low cosmic ray rate and its wide angular distribution around the zenith direction , which implies long data taking time to obtain significant statistics , is the main limiting factor for the application of the described method .      in",
    "@xcite it was suggested that muon stability monitoring technique could be effectively applied also to civil engineering , to supervise static stability of dams , historical monuments , such as towers or belfries , and buildings in seismic areas .",

    "the problem of the monitoring of the wooden vaulted roof of the  palazzo della loggia \" , as described in  , can be synthesized as follows : the possible displacements of a certain number of constituent elements of the wooden vaulted roof must be monitored relative to a reference coordinate system fixed with the masonry structure of the building .",
    "the total elapsed time over which the monitoring should be performed is of the order of years , and the frequency of sampling measurements of the order of days or weeks .",
    "it is worth remarking that the mechanical method actually adopted in  @xcite could only provide the measurement of the horizontal relative displacement of points of the wooden structure in opposite positions and not their absolute displacements relative to a common reference system linked to the building structure .",

    "however , the proposed method is based on a relative measurement , say considering differences between measurements performed at different times , thus the effect of the terrestrial magnetic field can be neglected .",

    "the angular deviation variance is proportional to the density of the material , its atomic number and the total amount of crossed material , and inversely proportional to the square of the muon momentum .",
    "the uncertainty in the prediction of the crossing point coordinates of the muon , in the  muon target \" plane , starting from the measurement of its trajectory in the  muon telescope \" , will depend on : position resolution of the muon detectors ; geometry of the  muon telescope \" ; distance of the  muon target \" from the  muon telescope \" ; amount of multiple scattering angular deviations and displacement of the muon trajectory , which depend on the amount of interposed materials and their positions .",
    "being these stochastic effects largely dominant , statistical distributions of the difference between measured crossing point coordinates in the  muon target \" and the predicted crossing point coordinates obtained by extrapolation from the  muon telescope \" is therefore necessary , in order to reduce the stochastic effects by statistical inference methods . using the methods developed in  @xcite , efficient unbiased estimators of the systematic displacement can be extracted by means of a statistical analysis of the distributions . in next subsections",

    "cosmic ray muons generating multiple hits in the same detector layer are rejected from the analysis .",

    "the @xmath13 distributions are not shown , since they are statistically identical to the @xmath12 ones .",
    "the number of events in each distribution is compatible with the number of expected cosmic ray muons entering the geometrical acceptance of the measurement system given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16=70  @xmath0/(m@xmath1  s  sr ) is the muon rate per unit area and unit solid angle around the zenith direction  @xcite , @xmath17 is the surface of the  muon target \" , @xmath18 is the lowest surface of the  muon telescope \" and @xmath19 is their distance .",
    "@xmath20 is the elapsed time of the data taking in seconds .    as the  muon target \" and the  muon telescope \" are exactly coaxial in the simulation , the @xmath12 distributions are symmetric and centered at zero .",
    "the shape of the distributions exhibits a central narrow peak with very long tails on both sides .",
    "this shape is due both to the intrinsic uncertainty of the  muon telescope \" in measuring the direction of the cosmic ray muon and to the multiple scattering angular deviations of the muon trajectories traversing the interposed materials . at fixed momentum and little angles ,",
    "these deviations follow a gaussian law with variance depending on the inverse square of the muon momentum  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect dominates for larger distances of the  muon target \" from the  muon telescope \" .",
    "the long tails of the distributions are due in part to low momentum muons , suffering larger deviations , and , in part , to spurious events corresponding to emission of delta rays or cosmic ray showering , most of which can be discarded with a more refined data analysis . at present , the only selection applied to these bad quality events is an arbitrary cut of both tails in the three distributions , discarding about 1.0% of the total events .",
    "the root mean squares of the @xmath12 distributions are 1.18  cm , 5.95  cm and 8.53  cm respectively for the three configurations examined .",
    "they represent the uncertainties in the prediction of the crossing coordinate of the cosmic ray muon on the  muon target \" detector extrapolated by the muon trajectory measured with the  muon telescope \" .",
    "this uncertainty depends mainly on the distance between  muon target \" and  muon telescope \" and on the amount and position of interposed materials .",
    "the mean value of the sample distribution represents an unbiased estimator of the position of the  muon target \" relative to the  muon telescope \" axis .",
    "the uncertainty on the mean value of a sample distribution is given by the well known relation  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is number of events in the distribution .",
    "in the three configurations considered and for a data taking time of 15  days , these standard uncertainties are respectively 0.03  mm , 0.37  mm , 0.78  mm .    since in the same geometrical condition @xmath22 is simply proportional to the data taking time , the measurement standard uncertainty depends only on the inverse of the square root of the data taking time . in   the relation of the position measurement standard uncertainty and",
    "the data taking time for the three examined conditions is plotted up to a data taking time of one month .",
    "as time increases the measurement standard uncertainty decreases . by fitting the plots with the general relation @xcite : @xmath23    standard uncertainty on the mean value of the sample distributions versus data taking time , for the  muon target \" in position b1 ( ) , b2 ( ) and b3 ( ) .,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    where @xmath24 is a constant depending on the geometry and materials interposed and @xmath25 is the data taking time in days , the following values for the constant @xmath24 are obtained in the three conditions considered : 1.12  mm  day@xmath26 , 1.42  mm  day@xmath26 , 2.96  mm  day@xmath26 , with the standard errors of the order of 1% .",
    "as expected , the standard uncertainty of the measurement system depends on the geometrical configuration considered , since both the root mean square of the @xmath12 distributions and the rate of useful events collected are strongly dependent on the geometry of the system and on the amount of materials interposed .    nevertheless ,",
    "although requesting different data taking times , the monitoring of the displacement of the three inspected points in the wooden vaulted roof of the  palazzo della loggia \" , using a cosmic ray tracking system , could provide performances compatible with the requested precisions and with the time scale characteristic of the deformation phenomenon .",
    "typical time scales , in the case of  palazzo della loggia \" and , in general , for historical buildings , may span over several years .    in position b1 , a measurement standard uncertainty of the order of 0.1  mm may be achieved in about one day of data taking , whereas a standard uncertainty of the order of 0.5  mm may be achieved in a week of data taking in position b2 , and in one month of data taking in position b3 , where  muon target \" and  muon telescope \" are positioned 13.0  m far apart .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the performances of the described measurement system can be enhanced in two different ways , both acting on system parameters and by improving the data analysis .",
    "indeed , equation   shows that the number of cosmic ray muons entering the acceptance of the measurement system is proportional to the product of the cross section surfaces of the  muon target \" and the  muon telescope \" .",
    "if the detector modules have the same effective surface , as in the case considered , an increase of 50% of the single module size may improve by a factor 5 the number of accepted cosmic rays , reducing of a factor 2.2 the data taking time needed to obtain the same standard uncertainty on the position measurement .",
    "further improvement can be obtained , as pointed out in  @xcite , discarding from the muon sample the low momentum muons by means of a muon adsorber in form of a thick iron plane positioned below the  muon telescope \" and followed by a further plane scintillation counter in coincidence . eliminating the low momentum muons , which suffer the largest multiple scattering deviations , and the possible electron showering that adds spurious events to the sample , the long tails of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 distribution can be reduced , reducing consequently the root mean square @xmath27 of the distributions .    as concerns the improvements in the data analysis , it was demonstrated in  @xcite",
    "that a more efficient unbiased estimator of the position and possible displacement of the  muon target \" detector can be obtained by fitting the parent population of the statistical variable @xmath12 by an appropriate analytical function and determining its shape parameters by the best fit procedure . the same best fit function , with only two free parameters , the first one representing the displacement of the whole function shape along the @xmath5 coordinate ( typically a parameter representing a central value or the mean value of the distribution ) and a second one giving the global scale factor , is then fitted to the distribution of a sample of events .",
    "the position parameter provides an estimator of the same parameter of the parent population , which is more efficient than the sample mean value is for estimating the population true mean value .",
    "this result appears reasonable , since the use of an analytical function approximating the shape of the parent population adds to the estimation procedure extra information coming from the full shape of the population , in comparison with the simple mean value parameter of the sample .",
    "the standard uncertainty of the position parameter of the best fit function is provided , in a reliable way , by the best fit procedure .    in the case studied in  @xcite",
    ", the shape of the parent population for the target detector was represented using a fitting function obtained as the sum of a number of gaussian functions with the same mean and different standard deviations and weights .",
    "the reason for this choice relays on the fact that , for a fixed value of the muon momentum , the physical process of multiple scattering produces , at a first approximation , a gaussian distribution of the deviation angle",
    ".    however , the spectrum of the cosmic ray muons at ground level is rather wide and the material thickness that they have to cross may be different from a cosmic ray to another one .",
    "in symmetric geometrical conditions , a sum of gaussian functions resulted therefore a good choice for representing the parent population .",
    "it is worth remarking that the parent population of the statistical variables under study may be obtained in two ways .",
    "either experimentally , when the conditions of the considered system make it possible , by a long calibration data taking , or , alternatively , by a monte carlo simulation of the process , taking into account in detail the structure and materials crossed by cosmic ray muons in all their possible flight paths through the system .    in  @xcite it was shown that the estimator of the true mean value of the parent population obtained by the fitting function procedure described above is 2.5 to 3.0 times more efficient than the simple sample mean value .",
    "this is indeed the ratio of the standard uncertainties of the two estimators on the same samples of data .",
    "distribution of the statistical variable @xmath12 for the  muon target \" in position b3 corresponding of a data taking of one year .",
    "the distribution likely represents the variable population .",
    "it has been fitted by a fitting function composed of the sum of four gaussian functions with the same mean ( p1 ) and different standard deviations ( p2 , p4 , p6 and p8 ) and weights ( p0 , p3 , p5 and p7).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the same procedure has been tested on the data obtained in the present simulation for the case of the position b3 , where the standard uncertainty on the sample mean value obtained by equation   is the largest .",
    "the parent population of the statistical variable was obtained generating cosmic ray events corresponding to one year data taking and cumulating them in a single @xmath12 distribution , which is shown in  .",
    "this distribution was fitted by an analytical function composed of a sum of four gaussian functions with the same mean and different standard deviations and weights . in   the result of the fitting procedure and the values of the different parameters of the fitting function",
    "are shown .",
    "then , the same function with only two free parameters , the common mean value and a global scale factor , has been fitted to the twelve samples corresponding to one month data taking .    in  , for each sample of one month data taking , the following parameters are given : in column  1 the number of the sample ; in column  2 the sample mean value ; in column  3 the standard uncertainty on the sample mean value given by equation  , where @xmath27 is the standard deviation of the sample distribution ; in column  4 the mean value of the fitting function used to fit the sample distribution ; in column  5 the standard uncertainty on the mean of the fitting function estimated by the fitting procedure .",
    "in the last two lines of   the following values are reported . in the first of them , in column  2 the average value of the mean values on the samples in the same column , in column  3 the average value of the standard errors on the sample mean values in the same column ;",
    "the error is the standard deviation of the distribution of the values . in columns  4 and  5",

    "the results reported in   show that the fluctuation of the mean value of the fitting function used to fit the sample distributions ( penultimate line column  5 ) is at least two time less that the fluctuation of the sample mean ( penultimate line column  3 ) .",

    "in this paper , the performances of a stability monitoring system , based on the tracking of cosmic ray muons , are compared with the features and performances of the actually adopted monitoring system , based on the measurements of the elongation of metallic wires stretched across the wooden vaulted roof of the  palazzo della loggia \" .",
    "the latter system has certainly demonstrated , during several years of operation , robustness , good measurement precision , promptness , reliability , at the price of complexity of installation and maintenance ( up to 25  m wires to stretch across the roof structure ) , need of large void spaces to be maintained inaccessible during the measurement , sensitivity to mechanical disturbance and variable climatic conditions , invasiveness , lack of flexibility .",
    "the former system , in spite of serious limitations in promptness and some limitations in measurement precision , may offer several advantages : ( i )  possibility to operate also when the parts to be monitored are not reciprocally visible and are separated by solid masonry structures , as walls and floors ; ( ii )  flexibility of installation :  muon telescope \" and  muon target \" can be easily located and easily moved and removed , detector disposition may be designed in relation to the specifying monitoring problem ; ( iii )  absence of moving mechanical parts ; ( iv )  compactness and absence of mechanical maintenance ; ( v )  use of a natural , high penetrating radiation , no need of artificial radiation sources and radiation protection safety instructions ; ( vi )  little invasiveness : no structural modifications requested ; ( vii )  low sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions , in particular to thermal variations ; ( viii )  possibility of global simultaneous monitoring of large parts of the building structure .",
    "these particular features may make the proposed system complementary , or even competitive for particular applications , also with other monitoring techniques typically used in this field .",
    "theodolites , laser scanners and lidar  @xcite provide accurate global position measurements , but need that the parts to be monitored be reciprocally visible in a clean atmosphere without turbulence , and request the presence of dedicated operators during the carrying - out of the measurement . moreover , they are not suitable for data taking over long periods of time .",
    "pendulums , inclinometers and extensometers  @xcite provide deformation or strain measurements in specific point positions ; these measurements must be correlated by a model of the building structure , often difficult to obtain accurately in historical buildings .",
    "global position system based methods  @xcite are hardly applicable to monitor internal parts of the building and need elaborate post processing of the data to perform high resolution position measurements .    a monitoring system based on cosmic ray muon tracking needs , conversely , the availability of a system of muon detectors with specific features and performances . in next  ,",
    "the expected characteristics of these detectors are defined and a possible good candidate , out of the many possibilities offered by the nuclear ad particle physics technologies , is identified .",
    "the design of a monitoring system based on cosmic ray muon tracking , in the form described in   or in other possible configurations , needs the availability of muon detector modules featuring characteristics suitable to satisfy the requirements of the specific application .",
    "the monitoring system may be particularly suited for applications in which the deformation under study develops over long times and must operate , for long periods , in weakly controlled conditions with low upkeep and steady data acquisition .",
    "therefore , the muon detectors should necessarily feature the following characteristics : ( i )  robustness and stability , insensitiveness to temperature and environmental modifications and limited need of maintenance by qualified personnel ; ( ii )  structural simplicity , compactness and low weight , with no use of high voltages and gas flushing , in order to simplify the operations of installation of the modules on the field , limit the invasiveness and avoid any mechanical , electrical and chemical hazard ; ( iii )  high detection efficiency to maximize the acquisition rate and minimize the data taking time needed ; ( iv )  low power consumption , all on board electronics and totally wireless communication systems to avoid , as much as possible , cabling and separate control units ; ( v )  use of standard technologies for the particle detection , electronics and data acquisition and , finally , overall low cost .",

    "in fact , it offers the possibility to cover large surfaces with high detection efficiency using well established technologies at reasonable cost , though with rough position resolution of the order of a few millimeters .    in  @xcite , muon radiography was applied to probe the internal structure of volcanoes . in  @xcite the inspections of the craters of mt .",

    "a realistic situation was considered : the exemplary case of the wooden vaulted roof of the  palazzo della loggia \" in the town of brescia , for which a stability monitoring campaign was performed , for more than ten years , by means of traditional mechanical methods .    a measurement system formed of a  muon telescope \" , to be located on a fixed part of the building ( the reference system ) and by a  muon target \" , to be positioned in the part of the building whose position has to be monitored , has been designed .",
    "the  muon telescope \" is composed of three muon detector modules , axially aligned 50  cm apart from each other , whose sensitive volume is a square 40  cm @xmath4 36  cm side and 6.0  mm thickness , made of two orthogonal layers of square scintillating fibers 3.0  mm  @xmath4  3.0  mm cross section .",
    "the  muon target \" is composed of one detector module of the same size .    in a monte carlo calculation program based on geant4 toolkit , the proposed muon stability monitoring system ,",
    "the geometry and relevant structure of the building and a realistic cosmic ray muon generator have been modeled .",
    "the procedure of measurement of the positions of three different points in the wooden vaulted roof , relative to the fixed reference system separated by a bulky wooden ceiling 15  cm thick , has been simulated .",
    "position measurement uncertainties of the designed muon monitoring system have been calculated as a function of the data taking time .",
    "the calculations demonstrated that the designed system may perform measurement precisions consistent with the amount of displacements under observation , with data taking times compatible with the time scale characteristic of the deformation phenomenon .",
    "both cyclic and systematic displacements observed in the  palazzo della loggia \" during several years of observation could have been observed , with suitable precision of less than 1.0  mm , by a monitoring system based on the tracking of cosmic ray muons .",
    "in addition , it was pointed out that the efficiency of the designed system , and consequently data taking times , may easily be improved of a factor 2 to 3 by improving the data analysis .",
    "consistent improvements in performances can also be obtained by modifying some geometrical parameters of the proposed measurement system .    in conclusion ,",
    "cosmic ray muon detection techniques are assessed for measurement applications in the field of civil engineering and may be particularly suitable for static monitoring of historical buildings , where the evolution of the deformation phenomena under study is of the order of months or years .",
    "appealing features of the proposed monitoring system are : ( i )  the use of a natural and ubiquitous source of radiation ; ( ii )  the applicability also in presence of horizontal and/or vertical building structures interposed between the reference system and the parts to be monitored ; ( iii )  the limited invasiveness , and the flexibility and easiness of installation of the monitoring system devices ; ( iv )  the possibility to design a global monitoring system , where the position of different points of the building may be simultaneously monitored relative to the same reference system ; ( v )  the use of well known physical principles and established technologies in the field of nuclear and particle physics .",
    "limiting features are the intrinsic stochastic nature of the behavior of the radiation utilized , which requests to cumulate statistical distributions to be treated by statistical inference methods , and the low rate of cosmic ray radiation , which makes this technique generally unfit for applications where promptness of response is requested .",
    "the performances of such measurement system strongly depend on the particular application under study , geometries and interposed materials .",
    "however , the system performances in the specific situation may be easily evaluated by monte carlo calculations and the system can be designed accordingly .",
    "the availability of muon detector modules featuring characteristics suitable to satisfy the specific application requirements is essential for the described technique to be realistically proposed .",
    "scintillating fibers of square cross section few millimeter side read by silicon photomultipliers sipm appear as very promising candidates , coping well the requirements of robustness , efficiency , stability and reliability , absence of any hazard , low cost that such a system should necessarily perform to be proposed for potential applications .",
