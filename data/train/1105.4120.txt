    "lorentz s equation @xcite and einstein s optical rate equations einstein are well known , very valuable , and widely used heuristic models for the description of light  matter interaction .",
    "both of them occupy an important place in the early teaching of quantum optics topics too , each of the models applying to different situations and allowing the study of different physical problems ( refractive index , laser action ) .",
    "although both models were formulated before the advent of quantum mechanics , they can be justified _ a posteriori _ within the framework of quantum optics theory in the appropriate limits.@xcite    generically speaking , formal derivations of heuristic models from first principles are important not only for aesthetic reasons and completeness arguments , but also for the clarification of their applicability domains . in this respect",
    "the situation of lorentz s and einstein s models is quite different : derivations of the former from the optical bloch equations are easily found in textbooks,@xcite but this is not the case for einstein s rate equations ( ere for short in the following ) , what results most surprising given the paramount importance of einstein s model . of course",
    "this does not mean that the connection between the optical bloch equations and ere has not been considered , as several quantum optics textbooks discuss ere and provide derivations of einstein s @xmath0 and @xmath1 coefficients for spontaneous and stimulated processes,@xcite see refs.4 - 6 .",
    "more general treatments can also be found in some textbooks such as those of refs.4,8 .",
    "but these treatments do not focus on the derivation of ere ( rather on those of einstein s @xmath0 and @xmath1 coefficients ) and , from our viewpoint , do not put enough emphasis on didactic aspects .",
    "we try to close this gap with the present article .",
    "einstein proposed his celebrated optical rate equations under the assumption of a strongly incoherent radiation , and this is the strict meaning of ere .",
    "however , similar rate equations apply when the atomic line - width ( alternatively , the decay rate of the induced electric dipole ) is much larger than the decay rates of the atomic levels ( see , e.g. , ref.3 ) , which occurs , in particular , in many laser systems and this is the reason why this approach is followed in most laser textbooks . in some quantum optics textbooks",
    "such rate equations are derived from optical bloch equations through the adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization and considering a fully coherent radiation field  unlike einstein .",
    "these derivations lead to correct rate equations but it is evident that they apply to situations ( strong atomic incoherence ) that are far from the ones where ere do ( strong radiation incoherence ) .",
    "that difference manifests not in the form of the equations ( both are rate equations involving the populations of the two atomic levels ) but in the expressions of the coefficients appearing therein : only in the limit of strong radiation incoherence the coefficient governing stimulated processes in the rate equations is einstein s @xmath1 coefficient .",
    "our treatment below shows , among other things , that the effect of radiation incoherence manifests as an increase in the decay rate of the _ ensemble averaged _ atomic dipole .",
    "hence when that effective damping rate is large as compared to the population inversion decay rate ( see below a more rigorous statement ) the adiabatic elimination of the electric dipole is justified , no matter whether the light incoherence or the atomic incoherence or both are responsible for that largeness .",
    "that procedure leads to optical rate equations in which the radiation  matter coupling constant depends both on the field spectral width and on the dipole decay rate , which however do not play a symmetric role .",
    "this explains the difference between an adiabatic elimination based on a large atomic incoherence and that based on a large light incoherence : only in the latter einstein s @xmath1 coefficient is obtained .",
    "we also notice that in common textbook derivations of the @xmath1 coefficient a weak field is assumed,@xcite a limitation absent in our derivation below .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present ere briefly . in section iii",
    "we introduce the optical bloch equations for a set of atoms and reduce them to an integro - differential equation for the ensemble averaged atomic inversion .",
    "then , upon applying a decorrelation approximation between light and atoms , the population inversion dynamics gets directly connected to the light spectrum .",
    "this decorrelation approximation , which should hold for incoherent light fields , will accompany us along all our derivations . from that integro - differential equation , in section",
    "iv we derive ere by assuming additionally a markov approximation , which is justified in the limit of very broad spectra , much broader than the atomic linewidth ( strong light incoherence ) . still adopting the markov approximation , in section",
    "v we generalize our previous analysis by considering that either the light spectrum is broad or the atomic line is ( as compared to the inversion relaxation rate ) , or both , what allows us to discuss the combined role of light incoherence and atomic incoherence . in the first case the usual ere are retrieved with the correct expression for einstein s @xmath1 coefficient while in the second case one recovers the rate equations used , e.g. , in laser modeling .",
    "a different approach is used then in section vi , where we remove the markov approximation and transform the original integro - differential equation into _ effective bloch equations_. importantly in such equations the effective ensemble - averaged atomic coherence is shown to display a decay rate which is equal to the sum of its bare decay rate and the width of the light spectrum .",
    "such effective bloch equations are analyzed in different limits , in particular when the adiabatic elimination of the effective atomic coherence is in order .",
    "this leads to an alternative derivation of ere , as well as to generalized rate equations , and allows setting the conditions under which rate equations ( ere in particular ) actually hold . in section vii",
    "we study numerically a particularly simple case ( that of a light field having only phase noise ) , which enables us to show the validity of the statistical decorrelation assumption used in all the previous derivations and to discuss a number of questions .",
    "finally the main conclusions of the work are given in section viii .",
    "ere describe the interaction of a broadband isotropic light field with a two  state atomic system .",
    "einstein@xcite postulated three basic light ",
    "matter interaction processes ( stimulated absorption and emission , and spontaneous emission ) , and established the rate equations governing the evolution of the populations of each of the atomic states . denoting by @xmath2 the population of the lower ( @xmath3 ) and upper ( @xmath4 ) atomic states , and assuming that @xmath5 is constant and large enough for individual absorptions and emissions only produce smooth temporal changes in @xmath6 , the time evolution of the populations is given by ( see appendix i for a generalized form )    [ einstein0 ] @xmath7where @xmath8 is the spectral energy density of the light field at the atomic transition bohr frequency @xmath9 , and @xmath0 and @xmath10are einstein s coefficients for spontaneous emission and stimulated processes , respectively , which neither depend on the field strength nor on time and verify @xmath11 . in terms of the normalized population inversion @xmath12 , hence @xmath13 , eqs.([einstein0 ] ) have the simpler looking form    @xmath14    we address the reader to ref.5 for a particularly didactic presentation and discussion of ere .",
    "consider a generic light field whose electric component @xmath15 we write as @xmath16 ,   \\label{e}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the field negative - frequency part ( that containing terms oscillating as @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) interacting with a collection of identical two  level atoms or molecules ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 will denote the atoms excited and fundamental states ) with bohr frequency @xmath9 and electric dipole matrix elements @xmath22 , which have been taken to be real vectors , aligned parallel to the cartesian z - axis , without loss of generality .",
    "working in the dirac picture , and after performing the rotating ",
    "wave approximation , the semiclassical optical bloch equations _ for an  individual atom _ , labeled by @xmath23 and located at @xmath24 , can be written as @xcite    [ bloch ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote , respectively , the population inversion and the slowly varying atomic coherence of atom @xmath23 described by its density matrix @xmath28 , and    @xmath29    is the complex rabi frequency of the light field at the location of atom @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "the effect of spontaneous  emission has been phenomenologically included through the damping terms , as standard semiclassical theory can not describe this process.@xcite we assume a decay rate @xmath0 for the population inversion which implies that the decay rate of the atomic coherence should be @xmath32 as we are assuming that only the upper atomic state is affected by spontaneous emission.@xcite however we shall attribute to @xmath33 a decay rate @xmath34 which includes an additional decay rate @xmath35 describing the effects of dephasing collisions ( those affecting the atomic coherence but not the population inversion ) . here",
    "we do not consider radiative collisions ( which affect both @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) in order to keep the problem simpler , but they can be easily included ( see appendix i for a brief discussion on this ) .    in order to cast our problem in a way similar to ere ( [ einstein ] ) , which involves just population inversions , we first eliminate the atomic coherence from ( [ bloch ] ) by integrating formally eq.([b2 ] ) , @xmath38 where a transient term , @xmath39 , has been dropped ( alternatively one can take @xmath40 without loss of generality assuming that the interaction is turned on at that instant ) . plugging this into eq.([b1 ] ) we get @xmath41 which is an integro - differential equation for the evolution of the population inversion of atom @xmath23 .      equation ( [ npunt ] ) rules the population inversion dynamics _ of a single atom_. as we are interested in the average evolution of the whole system  the ensemble of atoms , which is the quantity described by ere , we introduce the ensemble averaged inversion @xmath42 where averages are defined as @xmath43 and compute its evolution equation from eq.([npunt ] ) as    [ bloch2 ] @xmath44    equations ( [ bloch2 ] ) describe the average dynamics of the system in an exact way , in the sense that no approximation has been done on the original bloch equations in order to arrive at them .",
    "clearly it is necessary to evaluate the correlation function @xmath45 in order to perform the time integral in eq.([npunt2 ] ) and then arrive at a connection of bloch equations and ere .",
    "a direct comparison between eqs.([einstein ] ) and ( [ bloch2 ] ) reveals a number of important differences .",
    "a main one is that eq.([einstein ] ) has no memory ( the time derivative of @xmath46 at time @xmath47 just depends on the value of @xmath46 at the same time @xmath47 ) while in eq.([npunt2 ] ) memory effects are present .",
    "we will consider this point later because a previous issue is that in ( [ npunt2 ] ) it is not only @xmath46 ( the ensemble averaged inversion ) that rules its evolution but the individual atomic inversions , @xmath36 , through the compound correlation kernel @xmath48 a first necessary condition for ( [ bloch2 ] ) to merge with ere is then that it should be possible to decorrelate @xmath49 in ( [ corrn ] ) as    @xmath50    with @xmath51 the field autocorrelation function .",
    "indeed this is a very reasonable approximation as @xmath45 contains correlations between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while @xmath54 is assumed to have a random character . in the following",
    "we adopt this decorrelation approximation ( [ decorr ] ) , which will be checked numerically in section [ sec : numerical ] .    using ( [ decorr ] ) , the rabi frequency definition ( [ rabi ] ) , and recalling that we are assuming that radiation is isotropic and unpolarized , which allows writing @xmath55eq.([npunt2 ] ) becomes @xmath56this form is actually very interesting as it allows making direct contact with the light spectrum via the wiener - khintchine theorem as shown in appendix ii . making use of eq.([wk2 ] ) in that appendix , i.e. , @xmath57we get    [ npunt_i ] @xmath58where a factor @xmath59 has been included in the prefactor of the integral in ( [ dn1 ] ) for convenience , @xmath60 denotes the spectral energy density of the light field and @xmath61 is a frequency - shifted field autocorrelation function defined in terms of its spectrum .",
    "this is the equation we analyze throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "as we already commented in the previous section ere have no memory while eq.([dn1 ] ) has . but let us put ourselves under the conditions considered by einstein : if the light spectrum is broad ( a highly incoherent light field ) the field autocorrelation function @xmath62 defined in ( intensity ) will be a very sharp function around @xmath63 . to be more precise ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath64 the width of @xmath65 , then @xmath62 will be effectively zero but for @xmath66 , where the coherence time @xmath67 , as follows from the properties of the fourier transform . then ,",
    "if @xmath68 as well one can substitute @xmath69 and @xmath70 under the integral in ( [ npunt2 ] ) . this constitutes a markov approximation indeed as with it one assumes that the lack of correlation in the field ( which implies a large enough amount of randomness in its evolution ) provokes the complete loss of memory of the inversion @xmath71 . under this `` light incoherence '' dominated scenario eqs.([npunt_i ] ) become , after performing the time integration ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is a dirac delta like function : it is a peaked function around @xmath74 , has a height equal to @xmath75 , a width equal to @xmath76 , and verifies @xmath77 .",
    "hence , as soon as @xmath78 ( which is a very short time ) , @xmath60 can be picked out of the integral as @xmath79 , leading to    [ ere ] @xmath80which coincides with ere ( [ einstein ] ) and gives the correct result for @xmath81 ( see ref.5 ) .",
    "in our previous derivation of ere we have assumed that the light spectrum was sufficiently broad as to bring @xmath46 outside the integral in ( dn1)the markov approximation  and to make the replacement @xmath82 .",
    "nevertheless one can still adopt the markov approximation without imposing @xmath83 , and this is what we face in this section .",
    "we are hence considering the possibility that , either because the light spectrum is broad or the atomic line is , or both , ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , the function @xmath85 under the integral in ( [ dn1 ] ) is strongly peaked around @xmath63 , allowing again the substitution @xmath86 under that integral .",
    "hence , under the markov approximation eqs.([npunt_i ] ) become , after performing the time integration ,    [ mark ] @xmath87where @xmath1 reads as in ( [ b ] ) , and we defined the dimensionless coefficient @xmath88where @xmath89this expression for @xmath90 neglects transient terms proportional to @xmath91 in the final result , which is a good approximation as soon as @xmath92 .",
    "the lorentzian @xmath93 is centered at @xmath94 and has a width ( fwhm ) equal to @xmath95 , hence it represents the shape of the atomic line : coefficient @xmath96 is given by the convolution of the ( normalized ) radiation spectrum with the atomic absorption spectrum and then provides a measure of the strength of the interaction .",
    "remarkably the markov approximation ( in conjunction with the decorrelation hypothesis ) leads naturally to a rate equation description of the system dynamics .",
    "nevertheless this rate equation ( [ erez ] ) is not ere ( [ ere ] ) in general because of the presence of coefficient @xmath97 : only if @xmath98 ere are obtained .",
    "hence in order to know whether ere describe the population dynamics or not it suffices to study the behavior of @xmath97 , as we do in the following subsections .      in the case when the spectrum is very broad as compared to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 : the `` light incoherence '' limit considered in the previous section ) the lorentzian @xmath90 in ( [ zeta - def ] ) acts as an effective dirac delta by selecting , from @xmath60 , just the portion around @xmath101 . then , if the spectrum is a smooth function of @xmath102 one can substitute @xmath103 by @xmath8 and , after performing the remaining integral in @xmath102 , we get @xmath104 , corresponding to ere ( [ ere ] ) , in agreement with our first derivation .      in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath105 , the atomic linewidth is much broader than the light spectrum ; hence one should expect radiation to behave as effectively coherent . in this case",
    "it is @xmath106 that acts as an effective dirac delta in ( [ zeta - def ] ) by selecting , from @xmath107 , the portion around the peak of @xmath108 . by analogy to the previous case we call this the `` atomic incoherence '' limit .",
    "denoting by @xmath109 the frequency at the peak of @xmath108 , coefficient @xmath110 takes the following expression    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the average e.m .  energy density ( see appendix ii ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the resonant case , @xmath113 , for simplicity , in which case @xmath114 ; taking into account that @xmath115 should be proportional to @xmath116 ( a triangular approximation to the integral @xmath117)@xmath118 , we conclude that @xmath119 and then the interaction is weaker in the `` atomic incoherence '' limit than in the `` light incoherence '' limit ( the ere case ) by a factor @xmath120 . note that this `` atomic incoherence '' limit corresponds to the usual case treated in many laser textbooks , where the polarization decay rate @xmath121 is assumed to be large , which allows the adiabatic elimination of the atomic coherence ( see next section for an in  depth study of this technique ) .      to conclude this section we consider a situation where one can study , in a continuous fashion , the combined role of the light incoherence and the atomic incoherence . for this a specific form of the spectrum must be chosen .",
    "we consider the usual lorentzian form @xmath122 where @xmath64 represents the width ( fwhm ) of the light spectrum .",
    "note that we are using a resonant spectrum ; detuned cases can be treated along similar lines .",
    "the final result reads @xmath123    note that @xmath124 .",
    "this expression contains , as special cases , the light incoherence limit , in which @xmath104 and ere ( [ ere ] ) are recovered , and the atomic incoherence limit where @xmath125 , all this in agreement with our previous discussion .",
    "we see then that there is a continuous transition from the regime where ere apply , dominated by light incoherence , and that typical of laser physics , dominated by atomic incoherence .",
    "let us insist in that in both cases , and in intermediate cases as well , the system dynamics is of rate equations type , see ( [ erez ] ) , but only in the light incoherence limit true ere are obtained .",
    "in the previous sections we have been able to provide a semiclassical optics derivation of ere , with the correct expression for the @xmath1 coefficient , under the decorrelation and markov approximations , whenever the latter is due to a strong light incoherence . in this case both assumptions are closely related as both are consequences of the randomness of the incoherent radiation field .    in this section",
    "we give an alternative derivation of ere by relaxing the markov approximation , which will give us relevant information about the role of the field spectrum ( height and width ) and of the dipole relaxation on the population dynamics .",
    "let us then return to the general case represented by eq.([npunt_i ] ) , in which only the decorrelation approximation has been done . in order to obtain some general , analytic result ,",
    "a choice must be made for the form of the spectrum and we use again a lorentzian one .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we shall also assume that its central frequency is resonant with the atomic transition , although this is inessential and the derivations that follow are easily generalized to the non - resonant case . using then ( [ w_lor ] ) the intensity ( [ intensity ] ) becomes @xmath126 @xmath127 and eq.([npunt_i ] ) can be written as @xmath128 where @xmath129 the @xmath1 coefficient reads as in ( [ b ] ) , and @xmath110 is given in ( zeta ) .",
    "notice that if @xmath46 varies slowly during a time interval @xmath130 then @xmath131 can be picked out from the integral in ( [ def_q ] ) at @xmath63 ( this is the markov approximation we made in the previous section ) and , after performing the remaining integral , @xmath132 once @xmath133 , leading to ere ( [ ere ] ) but with a modified coefficient for the stimulated processes when @xmath110 differs from unity as already discussed .    the integro - differential eq.([dndt2 ] ) can be easily transformed into a pair of coupled linear differential equations by taking the time derivative of ( [ def_q ] ) ,    [ bloch_eff ] @xmath134 which are _ effective bloch equations _ with @xmath135 playing the role of a kind of normalized average medium polarization .",
    "let us recall that this set of equations is exact ( for a lorentzian spectrum ) but for the decorrelation assumption ( [ decorr ] ) , which should hold under a wide variety of conditions .",
    "furthermore notice that for @xmath136 , i.e. , for a fully coherent field hence characterized by a constant rabi frequency @xmath137 ( real without loss of generality ) , eqs.(bloch_eff ) are equivalent to eqs.([bloch ] ) ( for @xmath138 @xmath139 ) upon identifying @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath8 with @xmath142 , as it must be.@xcite    we see that by assuming the decorrelation hypothesis and by taking a lorentzian spectrum for the radiation field , the average bloch equations for the atom gas can be reduced to a pair of effective bloch equations in which the effective medium polarization decays at a rate @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the fwhm of the light spectrum . within the range of validity of the assumptions",
    "the above amounts to say that the incoherence of the radiation field is in some way transferred to the average medium polarization , manifesting as an increase in its decay rate similar to the effect of non - radiative collisions , which are accounted for by @xmath145 .",
    "notice however that @xmath64 and @xmath35 do not enter symmetrically in the equation of evolution of @xmath46 , because of coefficient @xmath97 , see ( [ zeta ] ) .      when @xmath146 is large as compared with @xmath0which is the situation we are interested in(see below for a more rigorous bound ) the effective coherence @xmath135  can be adiabatically eliminated from the effective bloch equations .",
    "we first integrate formally eq.([dqdt ] ) thus recovering ( [ def_q ] ) . repeatedly integrating ( [ def_q ] ) by parts we easily get    @xmath147 \\bar{n } \\left(t\\right ) ,   \\label{serie}\\ ] ]    and we see that for large enough @xmath148 we can approximate @xmath149 ( notice that this is the same as taking @xmath150 in eqs.([bloch_eff ] ) : the usual adiabatic elimination procedure ) . using this result in the equation for @xmath151 we retrieve ( [ erez ] ) , which was obtained under the markov approximation in that section .",
    "we see then that the latter and the adiabatic elimination of the effective coherence lead to the same result , as expected , thus completing our second derivation .",
    "notice that , as already commented , we obtain a modified coefficient for the stimulated processes as in general @xmath152 .",
    "we shall come back to this difference later .",
    "one of the virtues of this procedure is that it provides us with a simple tool to determine the conditions under which ere ( or rate equations in general ) are correct , i.e. , the conditions under which the above adiabatic elimination holds .",
    "we can estimate how large @xmath148 must be by comparing the first two terms in ( [ serie ] ) .",
    "the necessary condition is @xmath153 , which using ( [ bloch_eff ] ) leads to @xmath154 for rate equations to be valid . using @xmath155",
    "the above conditions read    [ ro0 ] @xmath156    the second condition above sets an upper limit on the field energy density which is not usually stressed .",
    "the first condition implies that the adiabatic elimination is correct independently on which of the two quantities @xmath64 or @xmath145 is the larger one : the condition is that the effective coherence decay rate be large and not whether this is due to dephasing collisions or to light incoherence , in agreement with our initial discussions .",
    "however , importantly , the result is not the same for large @xmath144 as for large @xmath145 : in the limit of large light incoherence @xmath157 one has @xmath158 and eq.([erez ] ) exactly coincides with ere , whilst in the limit of large dephasing collisions rate , @xmath159 , one has @xmath160 .",
    "this difference can be rephrased in the following way : for large @xmath64 the coefficient for stimulated processes is einstein s @xmath1 , whilst for large @xmath161 the coefficient is not @xmath1 but @xmath162 ( see endnote10 ) .",
    "this is the essential difference : einstein s @xmath1 coefficient appears only when the field is sufficiently incoherent and not when dephasing collisions are large .",
    "this is so because although dephasing collisions and light incoherence enter symmetrically in the equation for the effective atomic coherence @xmath135 , through the effective damping rate @xmath163 , they do nt in the equation for the inversion precisely because of the form of coefficient @xmath97 .",
    "we note here that in most textbooks rate equations are derived from optical bloch equations ( [ bloch ] ) through the adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization _ without _ performing any ensemble averaging that accounts for the light incoherence . in this case",
    "a constant rabi frequency is usually assumed , corresponding to coherent radiation , and the atomic dipole relaxation rate @xmath164 is assumed to be much larger than the population one because of the existence of frequent dephasing collisions . as we have seen",
    "this is a correct and legitimate way to derive rate equations , but it is not the right way for deriving ere : the price paid with this simplified presentation is an incorrect expression for the @xmath1 coefficient .",
    "compared to ere ( [ ere ] ) the system ( [ bloch_eff ] ) has an extra equation that allows for a richer dynamics .",
    "we shall now compare the solutions of both models in two different time regimes to obtain a better estimate of the necessary conditions for ere  be valid than that of inequality ( [ ro0 ] ) .      for short times after the illumination has been switched on , at @xmath165 , the predictions of both models given by ere ( [ erez ] ) and the effective bloch eqs.([bloch_eff ] ) differ .",
    "assuming @xmath166 and @xmath167 we easily obtain    @xmath168    this means that ere are overlooking the dynamics at the initial times , see fig.1(b ) , in a way similar to what happens with the application of fermi s golden rule to the photo - ionization problem.@xcite a way to cure the problem consists in taking @xmath169 out of the integral in ( [ def_q ] ) when considering the strongly incoherent limit ( i.e. , large @xmath148 ) , and retaining the exact value of the integral , i.e. , approximate @xmath170 by @xmath171 . with this approximation",
    "we get from ( [ dndt2 ] ) the modified ere ,    @xmath172    that predicts a short time evolution as in , see fig.1(b ) .",
    "we can now see clearly that the linear time dependence predicted by ere ( [ erez ] ) at short times is an artifact as we are using an approximate equation in a region ( @xmath173 ) where it is not supposed to be valid .      at long times both the rate equations ( [ erez])ere ( [ ere ] )",
    "is special case  and the effective bloch eqs.([bloch_eff ] ) reach the same steady state , @xmath174a stability analysis of ere provides further insight in how this steady state is approached : it is performed by considering a situation in which @xmath151 is close to @xmath175 and seeing how the increment @xmath176 evolves according to ( [ erez ] ) .",
    "one trivially gets @xmath177which leads to a monotonous evolution @xmath178 in which @xmath179 decreases in time .",
    "the situation is slightly more involved in the effective bloch equations case ( [ bloch_eff ] ) .",
    "like before , we introduce the two increments @xmath180 and @xmath181 [ notice that @xmath182 and obtain @xmath183which leads to an evolution of the form @xmath184 with    [ lam ] @xmath185where in the last expression we used ( [ zeta ] ) . in the strongly incoherent limit defined by @xmath186 the above eigenvalues",
    "take the simple form @xmath187 , and @xmath188 : the large and negative eigenvalue @xmath189 is responsible for a fast evolution that equalizes @xmath190 and @xmath179 , and from then on the system evolves as governed by ere .    for smaller incoherence , however , @xmath191 may become complex , thus signalling rabi oscillations with angular frequency equal to @xmath192 , which requires @xmath193 , i.e. ,    @xmath194    hence there are relaxation oscillations in the approach to steady state whenever the light spectral energy density is large enough , in the sense of eq.([ro1 ] ) , in stark contrast to the ere prediction .",
    "nonwithstanding , the observability of the oscillations must be examined because these are damped oscillations according to eq.([lam ] ) : in order that relaxation oscillations are present their frequency should be larger than , say , half their damping rate .",
    "it is easy to check that eq.([ro1 ] ) already implies that condition , hence we conclude that relaxation oscillations will occur whenever eq.([ro1 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "we conclude that there will be no _ qualitative _ differences between the predictions of rate equations and effective bloch equations , i.e. , that rate equations  are correct , whenever @xmath195 which clarifies the meaning of symbol @xmath196 in inequality ( [ ro0 ] ) . of course , that these equations actually correspond to ere also requires the light incoherence limit @xmath197 , in which case the condition becomes @xmath198 .",
    "in the previous sections we have derived ere ( and other rate equations ) by making use of two hypotheses : the decorrelation between the field and the inversion and the markov approximation . as the decorrelation hypothesis is crucial for all subsequent derivations and although reasonable because both @xmath199 and @xmath151 are random variables , we verify its validity for didactic purposes . for this aim we consider a light field having only phase noise and a tunable degree of incoherence , and take @xmath200 in order to concentrate on the role of light incoherence . we write the rabi frequency at the location of atom @xmath201 ( [ rabi ] ) as @xmath202 $ ] , with @xmath203 , and the phase follows the evolution equation @xmath204 being @xmath64 a diffusion coefficient that measures the degree of incoherence of the light field and @xmath205 a random function without correlation between atoms .",
    "a simple case in which this is verified is when @xmath206 are different realizations of white gaussian noise @xmath207 which has a mean of @xmath208 and correlation@xcite @xmath209 note that the averaging operator ( [ aver ] ) has the same effect as the stochastic averaging because we are identifying each atom with a single realization of the problem , and for this reason we keep the same symbol , namely `` @xmath210 '' , for the averaging in both pictures .",
    "the problem can thus be described by a set of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , comprising the bloch eqs.([bloch ] ) and eq.([fip ] ) :    [ stochastic ] @xmath211 note that we have omitted the atomic subscript @xmath201 as eqs.(stochastic ) are interpreted as sdes .",
    "the field model used here represents laser radiation of finite linewidth.@xcite indeed the spectral energy density @xmath60 of such field is given by , see appendix [ appendix2 ] ,    @xmath212 } \\right\\rangle e^{i\\left ( \\omega _ { 21}-\\omega \\right ) \\tau } , \\ ] ]    where eqs.([rabi ] ) , ( [ pol ] ) , ( [ wk1 ] ) and ( [ b ] ) have been used . as @xmath213 is a wiener process ,",
    "see eq.([s3 ] ) , its stochastic average is @xmath214 \\right ) \\right\\rangle = \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2}\\delta \\left\\vert \\tau \\right\\vert \\right ) $ ] , see ref.9 , and therewith we get @xmath215which is a lorentzian spectrum , as ( [ w_lor ] ) , centered at @xmath216 and having a width ( fwhm ) equal to @xmath64 . in this case",
    "@xmath217clearly @xmath64 controls the degree of incoherence as anticipated .",
    "we note that ere ( [ einstein ] ) in this case , according to ( [ w21 ] ) , reads @xmath218    we integrated numerically eqs.([stochastic ] ) by means of a fixed  step midpoint rule algorithm.@xcite the gaussian noise @xmath219 was generated with the box ",
    "muller method.@xcite depending on @xmath144 , we averaged our results over a number of @xmath220 realizations  or atoms  as many as necessary in order to obtain smooth results .",
    "we used different values of @xmath221 and @xmath64 and in all cases we fully confirmed the validity of assumption ( [ decorr ] ) .",
    "we also compared the results of the full time evolution as given by the effective bloch eqs.([bloch_eff ] ) derived in the previous section and eqs.([stochastic ] ) , as shown in fig.1 where the ensemble averaged population inversion @xmath46 is represented as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath222 for three values of the rabi frequency .",
    "no difference can be found between the two predictions , which again confirms the validity of the decorrelation hypothesis ( [ decorr ] ) .",
    "hence we arrive at the conclusion that for a field whose incoherence is solely due to phase noise , eq.([fip ] ) , the effective bloch model ( [ bloch_eff ] ) is exact , and hence also that ere ( [ erephase ] ) are exact for large enough @xmath144 , roughly for @xmath223 , see eq.([thr ] ) .",
    "we also paid attention to the influence of the number of stochastic trajectories @xmath224 .",
    "in fig.2 we represent the results of the numerical integration of eqs.([stochastic ] ) for two different sets of parameters corresponding to cases with and without relaxation oscillations ( see caption ) using different values of @xmath224 ( namely @xmath225 and @xmath226 ) . the first feature to be noticed , see fig.2(a ) , is that for @xmath227 and @xmath228 the trajectories exhibit noisy rabi oscillations which disappear for larger @xmath224 . in fig.2(b )",
    "the rabi oscillations manifest as relaxation oscillations , but a closer look reveals that also in this case the _ individual _ rabi oscillations manifest well beyond the disappearance of the relaxation oscillations . in other words ,",
    "the individual atomic behavior exhibits rabi oscillation , and it is the averaging that removes them .",
    "it is remarkable how the smooth averaged trajectories of fig.1 are approached as @xmath224 grows , and it is interesting to note that for small @xmath224 some oscillations are seen that disappear for larger values of @xmath224 .",
    "these plots suggest that @xmath229 is a large enough number of trajectories ( or atoms ) for the effective bloch model ( [ bloch_eff ] ) or ere ( [ erephase ] ) , to be valid , given the chosen parameters .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig.3 where we represent the steady state reached by the system after a long enough transient , as well as its uncertainty , as a function of @xmath224 .",
    "notice that for @xmath230 the uncertainty is almost negligible .",
    "we have provided a straight derivation of einstein s rate equations ( ere ) from the semiclassical optical bloch equation for an ensemble of closed two  level atoms or molecules .",
    "the derivation has been done by assuming the statistical decorrelation between the inversion and field correlation function , and a markov approximation owed to the ( assumed ) broad light spectrum .",
    "as well connections between ere and usual laser rate equations have been considered , showing that leading to ere which then have been analyzed in both the limit where light incoherence dominates , resulting in ere with the correct einstein @xmath1 coefficient , and the limit where atomic incoherence dominates , leading to laser rate equations . in the second derivation , the markov approximation was replaced by the assumption of a lorentzian spectrum in the radiation field .",
    "this second derivation led to a set of effective bloch equations that contain information about the radiation spectrum whose bandwidth appears as an increase in the effective coherence decay rate .",
    "then , for large enough spectral width , ere are derived by adiabatically eliminating the effective coherence . through the analysis and comparison of the solutions of both the ere and effective bloch models",
    "we have derived the conditions under which the former are applicable .",
    "we have discussed the subtle difference that exists between an adiabatic elimination based on large @xmath64 ( large spectral width ) that led to ere and provided the correct expression for einstein s @xmath1 coefficient , and an adiabatic elimination based on large @xmath231 ( large atomic coherence decay rate ) which leads to correct laser rate equations but does not provide a correct @xmath1 coefficient .",
    "in other words : einstein s @xmath1 coefficient can only be correctly derived for large spectral width .",
    "we think that this is an important issue from the conceptual and pedagogical points of view . as well , upper bounds on the field strength have been derived which should be fulfilled in order that a rate equation description is valid .",
    "finally , we have studied numerically the decorrelation hypothesis and checked the different predictions in the special case of a field having only phase noise .",
    "we think our derivations will help students in understanding more clearly how the ere model can be justified and under which conditions it can be applied .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge help from mara gracia ochoa with some numerical simulations . this work has been supported by the spanish government and the european union feder through project fis2008 - 06024-c03 - 01 .",
    "consider that besides spontaneous emission from the upper to the lower atomic state we also take into account the existence of atomic collisions able of forcing atomic transitions ( usually referred to as radiative collisions ) .",
    "if we denote by @xmath232 the rate at which these collisions transfer population from level @xmath233 to level @xmath234 ( @xmath232 depending on the temperature and on the collision cross  section of the atoms forming the gas ) , we can rewrite eqs.([einstein0 ] ) as @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",

    "be given by planck s formula,@xcite it is easy to see that @xmath239 , with @xmath240 boltzmann s constant and @xmath241 the absolute temperature .",
    "this relation between @xmath242 and @xmath243 means that , in thermal equilibrium , for each collision induced atomic excitation there must be a corresponding deexcitation .",
    "we can also add radiative collisions in the optical bloch equations in a similar way .",
    "now we must write @xcite    [ aux1 ] @xmath244 with @xmath245 .",
    "notice that , in general , @xmath246 is a good approximation .",
    "let us insist in that the above bloch equations , and also eq.([aux ] ) , apply to a _ closed _ two level atomic system . if the system is assumed to be open ( i.e. , if relaxation processes can bring the atom into atomic states different from the two that interact with the light field ) the relaxation terms need to be appropriately generalized ( see , e.g. , ref.3 ) .    by following exactly the same lines we have followed in this article , the generalized einstein eq.([aux ] )",
