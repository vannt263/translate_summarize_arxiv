    "the recent discovery of the top quark by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the fermilab tevatron has stimulated interest in top - quark physics @xcite .",
    "the standard model of the strong and electroweak interactions predicts that the top quark should behave , both in its production and decay , as a heavy version of the five lighter quarks .",
    "however , the large mass of the top quark relative to the five lighter quarks suggests that there may be something special about its properties .",
    "it is therefore crucial that we study the properties of the top quark with every probe available to us .    in this paper",
    "we study a neglected probe of the top quark : the process @xmath4 via a virtual @xmath5-channel @xmath3 boson , as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) @xcite .",
    "this process is similar to the well - known @xmath3-gluon fusion process @xcite , depicted in fig .",
    "1(b ) , in that it produces a single top quark rather than a @xmath6 pair .",
    "however , the process @xmath7 probes the top quark with a timelike @xmath3 boson , @xmath8 , while the @xmath3-gluon - fusion process involves a spacelike @xmath3 boson , @xmath9 .",
    "these processes are therefore complementary in that they probe the charged - current interaction of the top quark in different regions of @xmath10 .",
    ", involves an on - shell @xmath3 boson , @xmath11 . ]",
    "another important feature of @xmath4 is that the hadronic cross section can be reliably calculated .",
    "the quark and antiquark distribution functions are evaluated at moderate values of @xmath12 , where they are well - known .",
    "the qcd correction to this process is straightforward and can be carried out to at least @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the initial quark - antiquark flux can be constrained by measuring @xmath14 , which also proceeds via a virtual @xmath5-channel @xmath3 boson . of the @xmath3 boson",
    "can not be determined .",
    "the process @xmath15 therefore provides a constraint on the quark - antiquark flux , not a direct measurement . ] the qcd correction to the initial state is automatically taken into account via this procedure ; only the qcd correction to the final state must be explicitly calculated , and this can be done reliably since it is free of collinear and infrared singularities .. ] in contrast , the @xmath3-gluon - fusion process involves the gluon distribution function , which is not well - known .    since the most important issue to be resolved is the observability of @xmath4 above backgrounds , we concentrate on this process in the context of the standard electroweak model . in this context",
    ", @xmath4 may provide the best direct measurement of the magnitude of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "if there are only three generations , unitarity of the ckm matrix implies that @xmath16 is very close to unity ( @xmath17 @xcite ) .",
    "if there is a fourth generation , @xmath16 could be anywhere between ( almost ) zero and unity , depending on the amount of mixing between the third and fourth generations .",
    "a measurement of @xmath16 less than unity would therefore be a major discovery .",
    "including the top - quark decay , the process @xmath4 yields the final state @xmath18 .",
    "there are several background processes which must be considered in order to establish whether the signal can be observed .",
    "the dominant irreducible background , @xmath19 , was considered in ref .",
    "we reconsider this background , as well as the other important irreducible and reducible backgrounds .",
    "the full set of backgrounds we consider is :    * @xmath18 * @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 denotes a light - quark or gluon jet ) * @xmath22 * @xmath23 ( @xmath3-gluon fusion ) * @xmath24    the raw cross sections for these processes at the tevatron ( @xmath25 tev @xmath26 collider ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc , @xmath27 tev @xmath28 collider ) are given in the first column of table  1 .",

    "we evaluate @xmath32 at the same scale as the parton distribution functions , with @xmath33 @xcite . ]",
    "the cross sections include a factor of 2/9 for the branching ratio of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the cross sections listed are for @xmath36 production only ; the inclusion of @xmath37 doubles the signals and backgrounds at the tevatron , and nearly doubles them at the lhc .",

    "the event is rejected if @xmath47 gev and @xmath46 .",
    "the overall reduction factor from rejecting these events is 1/50 at the tevatron and 1/30 at the lhc .",
    "most of the remaining background events are from the leptonic decay of the extra @xmath3 boson ( @xmath65 at the tevatron , @xmath66 at the lhc ) .",
    "this is unnecessary at the tevatron , but is desirable at the lhc , where @xmath6 is the largest background . ]    in the fourth column of table  1 , we impose a cut on the @xmath67 invariant mass , @xmath39 gev .",
    "this essentially eliminates the @xmath22 background , and reduces the @xmath18 and @xmath20 backgrounds .",
    "the loss of signal is modest .",
    "if there is a higgs boson of mass less than 120 gev , it too will contribute to the background via @xmath68 @xcite , and may require a slightly higher cut on @xmath69 .    due to the enormous background from @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 denotes a jet from a light quark or gluon ) , it is necessary to tag one or both of the @xmath40 quarks from the @xmath70 signal .",
    "the most efficient means of @xmath40 tagging is with a silicon vertex detector ( svx ) .",
    "the cdf collaboration has achieved a tagging efficiency of roughly @xmath71 per `` fiducial '' @xmath40 jet ( @xmath72 gev and within the coverage of the svx ) , with a probability of less than @xmath73 for a light - quark or gluon jet to fake a @xmath40 jet @xcite .",
    "the new svx for run ii , with three - dimensional vertex information , should increase the efficiency to as high as @xmath74 while maintaining or reducing the fake rate @xcite .",
    "pixel detectors , such as those planned for the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite detectors at the lhc , could further increase the efficiency .",
    "we assume a @xmath74 tagging efficiency - tagging efficiency . ] per fiducial @xmath40 jet ( @xmath72 gev , @xmath75 ) with a @xmath73 fake rate from fiducial light - quark and gluon jets .",
    "the best signal significance is obtained by tagging both @xmath40 jets .",
    "tagging , the @xmath3-gluon - fusion background is prohibitively large .",
    "the @xmath54 jet is often below the @xmath76 gev threshold , and the @xmath40 jet from the top decay plus the spectator jet ( from the radiation of the virtual @xmath3 ) fake the signal . ]",
    "the final column in table  1 lists the cross sections including the @xmath40-tagging efficiency . with",
    "double @xmath40 tagging , the @xmath20 background is reduced to a negligible level at the tevatron .    another piece of information at our disposal is the invariant mass of the @xmath3 boson plus @xmath40 jet , @xmath77 , which equals @xmath78 for the signal but has a continuous spectrum for the @xmath18 background .",
    "unfortunately , this information can not be utilized directly .",
    "one does not know _ a priori _ which @xmath40 jet is from the top - quark decay . furthermore , the @xmath3-boson momentum must be reconstructed from the lepton momentum plus the missing @xmath79 , and this yields two solutions .",
    "thus each event has four possible assignments of momenta , leading to four different values of @xmath77 .",
    "the most straightforward method to deal with this four - fold ambiguity is to assign four values of @xmath77 to each event , and plot the differential cross section as a function of this invariant mass ( weighting each entry by 1/4 of an event ) .",

    "the signal is prominent at the tevatron , but is masked by the @xmath6 and @xmath3-gluon - fusion backgrounds at the lhc , which have the same shape as the signal .",
    "these backgrounds are enhanced at the lhc relative to the @xmath7 signal because they are initiated by gluons .    in @xmath26 collisions",
    ", the @xmath40 jet from the process @xmath80 tends to go in the direction of the proton beam @xcite .",

    "we show in fig .",

    ", the total signal is 8.8 @xmath82 on a background of 7.2 @xmath82 .",
    "the number of events acquired in 3 @xmath2 of integrated luminosity is enough for the signal to correspond to more than a @xmath84 fluctuation of the continuum background .",
    "this integrated luminosity corresponds to about 1.5 years of running at the tevatron with the main injector and the recycler ( @xmath85 ) @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath16 is close to unity , 3 @xmath2 of integrated luminosity yields a @xmath86 measurement of @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath87 measurement of the partial width @xmath88 .",
    "a @xmath89 measurement of @xmath16 requires 12 @xmath2 , which could be delivered in a little more than a year with a high - luminosity tevatron ( @xmath90 ) @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath86 measurement of @xmath91 .",
    "the systematic error in the measurement is small , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "if @xmath16 is significantly less than unity , the rate for @xmath0 is suppressed , and this process is therefore more difficult to detect . if no signal is observed with 3 @xmath2 of integrated luminosity , an upper bound of @xmath92 ( @xmath93 c.  l. ) can be deduced .",
    "the absence of a signal with 12 @xmath2 implies @xmath94 .",
    "we have shown that the process @xmath4 is potentially observable at the tevatron with 3  @xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the signal is straightforward to isolate from backgrounds , and requires tagging both @xmath40 jets .",
    "in contrast , this process is masked at the lhc by backgrounds from @xmath6 and single - top - quark production via @xmath3-gluon fusion .",
    "we hope this work will motivate a more detailed study of this process by the detector collaborations .",
    "the process @xmath4 at the tevatron may be the best direct measurement of @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath3-gluon fusion process also provides a measurement of @xmath16 @xcite , and has the advantage of a larger cross section .",
    "however , it suffers from the uncertainty in the gluon distribution function .",
    "in contrast , the quark - antiquark flux for @xmath4 is well - known , and can be constrained by measuring @xmath14 . both @xmath4 and @xmath3-gluon fusion",
