    "superconductivity occurs as a result of the second - order phase transition , accompanied by a sudden appearance of the superconducting order parameter below the critical temperature @xmath5 and the upper critical field @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this should lead to an abrupt vanishing of resistance .",
    "however , in reality resistive transitions are always broadened , especially in magnetic field .",
    "this is usually ascribed to flux - flow phenomenon caused by motion of abrikosov vortices @xcite .",
    "broadening can also be caused by spatial inhomogeneity ( e.g. variation of @xmath5 ) , or superconducting fluctuations @xcite , particularly for high temperature superconductors .",
    "finally , surface superconductivity ( ssc ) may survive up to a significantly higher field @xmath6 than bulk superconductivity @xcite , which can also smear the superconducting transition .",
    "although ssc is quite profound in polished clean superconductors @xcite , it is usually ignored for disordered , polycrysstaline films because ssc is considered to be very sensitive to the quality of the surface ( e.g. , surface passivation @xcite and order parameter suppression @xcite ) , surface roughness @xcite and surface scattering @xcite .",
    "the broadening is detrimental for superconducting devices such as transition - edge sensors @xcite and resonators @xcite .",
    "presence of several mechanisms makes the interpretation of broadening ambiguous .",
    "the lack of understanding does not allow confident extraction of fundamental parameters of superconductors , such as @xmath0 , because it is unclear which point at the transition curve corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "arbitrary criteria , such as 10 , 50 or 90 @xmath8 of the normal state resistance @xmath9 , are commonly applied which apparently does not work for high-@xmath5 superconductors with very broad transitions @xcite .",
    "therefore , clarification of the mechanism of broadening is important both for fundamental and applied research on superconductors .    in this work we study the origin of broadening of superconducting transitions in sputtered nb films .",
    "we perform simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements , which allow unambiguous ascription of @xmath0 to the bottom of resistive transition @xmath10 .",
    "the top of transition corresponds to @xmath11 times higher fields , which is close to the third critical field @xmath12 for destruction of surface superconductivity .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) nature of ssc at @xmath13 is confirmed by observation of cusp - like angular dependence of magnetoresistance .",
    "thus we conclude that surface superconductivity , rather than flux - flow , inhomogeneity or fluctuations , is the primary cause of broadening of superconducting transitions in magnetic field .",
    "our data indicates that surface superconductivity is remarkably robust even in disordered polycrystalline films and , surprisingly , even in perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "the studied sample contains several nb / al - alox / nb tunnel junctions with sputtered nb electrodes of thicknesses @xmath14 and 50 nm .",
    "junction characteristics in perpendicular fields were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to different thicknesses ,",
    "electrodes have slightly different @xmath5 of 9.2 and 8.8 k. parameters extracted from tunneling characteristics are determined by the thinner electrode , while transport measurements are made at the thicker electrode .",
    "this explains a minor difference in @xmath0 values obtained by those techniques .",
    "measurements are performed in a gas - flow @xmath15he cryostat with a superconducting solenoid .",
    "samples are mounted on a rotatable holder with the alignment accuracy @xmath16 .",
    "details of the setup can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in figures [ fig : fig1 ] ( a - c ) we show superconducting transitions of a 150 nm thick nb film : ( a ) @xmath17 in zero field and @xmath18 at @xmath19 k for field perpendicular ( b ) and parallel ( c ) to the film .",
    "it is seen that at zero field the @xmath17 transition is very sharp and does not show any extended fluctuation region or inhomogeneity . however , @xmath18 transitions are quite broad .",
    "interestingly , @xmath18 is broader when the field is parallel to the film .",
    "this confronts interpretation of broadening in terms of vortex motion because the driving lorentz force is most effective in perpendicular and vanishes in parallel field .",
    "therefore , this broadening is not consistent with either flux - flow , inhomogeneity or fluctuation mechanisms .          in order to analyze surface superconductivity scenario , first of all",
    ", it is necessary to determine bulk @xmath0 . for this",
    "we perform magneto - tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] represents a comparison of theoretically calculated ( a - c ) and experimentally measured tunneling characteristics of our nb / alalox / nb junction ( data from ref .",

    "there is a good quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental characteristics .",
    "the main spectroscopic features are the sharp sum - gap peak at @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the superconducting gap and the suppressed quasiparticle current and conductance below the sum - gap voltage . with increasing field the peak is decreasing in height and is moving to lower voltages .",
    "simultaneously the sub - gap conductance is increased .",
    "all this is due to suppression of the superconducting gap by magnetic field .",
    "the extent of suppression depends solely on @xmath25 . above @xmath0",
    "the superconducting gap vanishes and the @xmath20-@xmath21 becomes linear ( ohmic ) .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath25 uniquely determines the shape of tunneling characteristics in magnetic field .",
    "therefore , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio @xmath25 can be uniquely determined from analysis of the shape of tunneling characteristics . in fig .",

    "the overall quality of scaling is quite good , which allows confident extraction of @xmath33 .",
    "thus obtained @xmath0 is unambiguous because it is deduced as a single fitting parameter for the whole set of d@xmath27d@xmath28 characteristics at fixed @xmath30 for different @xmath29 .",

    "using the relation @xmath34 we calculate the coherence length @xmath35 nm .",
    "this small value indicates that the film is in the dirty limit with a very short scattering length due to a disordered film structure with nm - scale crystallites .",
    "thus , the studied nb film @xmath14 nm is an order of magnitude thicker than @xmath36 .",
    "this leads to an important for a further discussion conclusion that our films are bulk three - dimensional ( 3d ) superconductors practically in the whole temperature range @xmath37 .",

    "ssc in the uniform case is not expected @xcite .",
    "the 2d nature of ssc should be reflected in a cusp - like angular dependence of @xmath12 , given by the equation @xcite : @xmath40 ^ 2a(\\theta ) + \\left|\\frac{h_{c3}(\\theta)}{h_{c3}^\\perp}\\sin\\theta\\right| = 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "it is only slightly different from tinkham s 2d result with @xmath42 .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( f ) shows angular - dependencies of magnetoresistance at @xmath19 k and at different fields below and above @xmath43 t. zero angle @xmath44 corresponds to field parallel to the film .",
    "it is seen that at 2.5 t very slightly below @xmath0 , @xmath45 is flat at @xmath44 , which is characteristic for 3d bulk nb .",
    "however , at @xmath46 angular dependence acquires a 2d cusp .",
    "since the film thickness is much larger than @xmath47 , the observed 2d behavior at low @xmath30 may originate solely from ssc .",
    "the sheet surface critical current ( in a / cm ) is @xcite : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the thermodynamic critical field ( in oe ) and @xmath50 is the ginzburg - landau parameter . typically such @xmath51 is in the range from few to few tens of a / m . for our films with @xmath52 and the width of few microns",
    "the @xmath51 is in the @xmath53a range , comparable to the probe current .",
    "therefore , the results do depend on the bias , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) .",
    "this is due to strong non - linearity of current - voltage characteristics at @xmath54 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( b ) . in order to demonstrate",

    "( [ iv ] ) it is @xmath58 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( c ) we show @xmath45 curves for the ssc model calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ hc3_q ] ) and ( [ r_q ] ) for @xmath59 at different bias .",
    "calculations are made for @xmath60 and @xmath61 and for @xmath62const .",
    "for comparison we also show flux - flow type dependence @xmath63 .",
    "it is seen that the cusp in the ssc model is much sharper , primarily due to non - linearity of the @xmath20-@xmath21 .",
    "overall behavior is similar to experimental data from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) , even though in experiment a very sharp cusp at @xmath44 survives up to much higher current .",
    "the difference is due to an oversimplified assumption of angular - independent @xmath62const , used in calculations . in reality",
    "@xmath64 has a sharp maximum at @xmath44 because the lorenz force vanishes as @xmath65 .",
    "it is possible to get a better fit using a more realistic @xmath64 , but we do nt want to go in to more complicated modelling because the main purpose of calculations was to demonstrate how non - linearity of @xmath20-@xmath21 s leads to a much sharper ( compared to a simple 2d flux - flow model ) cusp in @xmath45 .      finally we discuss fluctuation contribution to the broadening of resistive transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( a ) we show normalized excess conductance @xmath66 for the data from figs . [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) in a double - logarithmic scale .",
    "such graph is usually used for analysis of fluctuation contribution to conductivity .",
    "dashed line shows @xmath67 dependence expected for 2d fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is seen that although there is a narrow range of fields close to @xmath0 with similar behavior , the overall agreement is poor . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( b ) we replot the same data in a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "it is seen that @xmath68 decays quasi - exponentially with increasing field at approximately the same rate for both field orientations .",
    "a similar exponentially decay versus both @xmath30 and @xmath29 has been reported for high-@xmath5 cuprates @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that it is generic also for conventional superconductors .",
    "such behavior is not expected for fluctuations @xcite and we argue that it is rather a signature of ssc .",
    "it is possible to distinguish fluctuation contribution from non - fluctuating ssc .",
    "ssc always leads to excess conductance , but fluctuation contribution to magnetoresistance can be both positive and negative @xcite .",
    "in particular , at low @xmath30 and at field perpendicular to the film the density - of - state contribution to fluctuations leads to excess resistance , rather than excess conductance @xcite .",
    "we clearly see such a contribution in our data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( c ) we show high - field part of excess conductance in the linear scale .",
    "it is seen that in parallel field there is always an excess conductance @xmath69 , which rapidly decreases upon approaching the surface critical field @xmath70 , but never really vanishes .",
    "the remaining tail is a signature of fluctuations that persist at any field .",
    "for perpendicular field , @xmath71 at high fields becomes _ negative _ , which is consistent with theoretical expectations for fluctuation contribution at @xmath72 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( d ) we check the power - law scaling suggested by eq .",
    "( [ r_q ] ) for ssc .",
    "it is seen that there is a good scaling in a broad field range , although extraction of the exponent @xmath57 is not very confident because it depends on the chose of @xmath12 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath73 . upon approaching @xmath12 ,",
    "deviations with opposite signs for parallel and perpendicular field orientations appear , signalizing fluctuation contributions .",
    "this indicates that ssc makes a dominant contribution to excess conductivity at @xmath74 , while fluctuation contribution starts to become significant only upon weakening of ssc at @xmath75 and takes over completely at @xmath76 .",
    "our results suggest that surface superconductivity is the primary cause of broadening of superconducting transition in magnetic field . as indicated in figs . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , @xmath7 corresponds to the bottom of transition , consistent with earlier studies @xcite , and @xmath12 to the top of the resistive transition .",
    "thus the full width of the transition is dominated by ssc .",
    "although ssc is well known for carefully polished single crystals @xcite , it is usually considered to be insignificant for disordered , rough or inhomogeneous superconducting films because of its assumed fragility and sensitivity to surface conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore , observation of a very robust ssc in our strongly disordered polycrystalline films is rather surprising , especially for field perpendicular to the film . in perfectly uniform films",
    "ssc should not occur at perpendicular field orientation @xcite . yet , ssc in perpendicular fields has been directly visualized by scanning laser microscopy for similar films @xcite and also reported for some layered supercondcutors @xcite and sintered polycrystalline mgb@xmath77 samples @xcite .",
    "presumably it is the polycrystallinity of our films that allows ssc at grain boundaries even in perpendicular fields .",
    "thus we conclude that surface superconductivity is a robust phenomenon that should be carefully considered in analysis of data close to superconducting transition .",
