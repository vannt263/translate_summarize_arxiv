    "the broad family of complex correlated oxides are the next frontier in novel materials , providing a rich variety of tunable properties that are both functionally useful and valuable in understanding fundamental condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , interfaces between perovskite - type oxides are relatively easily achieved at an atomically precise scale , yielding new and exciting properties.@xcite as these materials become more important , achieving a firm understanding of their surfaces , including the role and degree that electron correlations play , is crucial .    in strongly correlated materials ,",
    "the on - site coulomb energy , @xmath6 , leads to dynamical correlations between electrons , tending towards their localization at atomic sites .",
    "incoherent electron states , the hubbard subbands , form either side of the coherent , one electron - like quasiparticle peak ( qp ) , and are referred to as lower and upper hubbard bands ( lhb and uhb respectively ) .",
    "transfer of spectral weight away from the qp into the lhb and uhb signals the effects of stronger electron correlations .",
    "such strong correlations can have profound effects on the electronic structure and material properties , most famously leading to insulating , rather than metallic , ground states.@xcite    sr@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 are prototypical strongly - correlated perovskites , with similar spectral weight in both the incoherent ( strongly correlated ) hubbard subbands and the coherent ( one electron - like ) quasiparticle states . although the spectral function of these materials has been well studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically,@xcite there is not a well established consensus on the form of the surface and bulk components , or as the sr content ( @xmath7 ) is varied .",
    "both endmembers are correlated metals and have been reported to exhibit metal - insulator transitions in ultrathin films due to a reduction in the dimensionality and corresponding narrowing of the v  @xmath5 bandwidth.@xcite generally , the focus of photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) studies has been on obtaining bulk - representative spectra . for example , laser - pes has been used at very low photon energies , below the minimum in the photoelectron inelastic mean free path ( imfp ) , to extract bulk qp spectra,@xcite although the lhb is not accessible at these low energies .",
    "conversely , soft x - rays have also been used to increase the depth sensitivity , and pes spectra were obtained which were either independent of @xmath7@xcite or which revealed an insulating surface.@xcite more recently , some progress has been made in understanding the behavior of the spectra with @xmath7 , with several reports agreeing that the lhb of cavo@xmath2 is more intense and closer to the fermi level , @xmath8 , than that of srvo@xmath2,@xcite indicative of the effects of stronger electron correlations .",
    "additionally , band dispersions and fermi surfaces have been clearly observed in both end - members.@xcite however , the behavior of the spectra at the surface compared with the bulk has received little experimental attention , despite the role of the surface being questioned and studied in detail theoretically.@xcite moreover , our knowledge of the `` bulk '' spectra from pes has so far been limited to analytical differences between spectra containing both bulk and surface components.@xcite    recently , resonant soft x - ray emission spectroscopy ( rxes ) measurements have reported truly bulk - representative information on the strongly - correlated v  @xmath5 bands , illustrating that the effects of electron correlations are more pronounced in cavo@xmath2 than in sr@xmath9ca@xmath9vo@xmath2 , and that the surfaces of both materials are `` more correlated '' than their bulk.@xcite although valuable , comparisons between rxes and pes spectra are complicated by the quite different scattering processes and comparatively poorer resolution of rxes ( in part , owing to the broadening due to the lifetime of the core hole ) . in order to elicit quantitative information on the evolution of electron correlations from the surface to the bulk , depth sensitive measurements using the same probe are clearly desired .    hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( haxpes ) extends conventional pes measurements at ultraviolet and soft x - ray energies into the hard x - ray regime ( @xmath10  kev ) , yielding much greater depth sensitivity ( @xmath11  nm compared with 0.5  nm at ultraviolet energies).@xcite however , at such hard energies , there are several additional considerations .",
    "most importantly , the cross section for photoionization drops off at higher energies , particularly for shallow binding energies at the valence band , @xcite and practical instrument resolutions are poorer than at low energies .",
    "additionally , the electron momentum distribution is focused into much tighter angles , meaning the coverage of the brillouin zone of a typical haxpes measurement is much broader , although recent technical advances have facilitated the momentum - resolved spectral function at hard x - ray energies.@xcite    we report here a haxpes study of the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 using photon energies of 4.2  kev and 2.2  kev .",
    "the valence band of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 measured using 4.2  kev photons is quantitatively compared with _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations of the bulk , and we show that the spectra can be well described by band theory with some modest adjustments to the orbital - dependent photoionization cross - sections . additionally , we find that the evolution of the valence band electronic structure with @xmath7 is dominated by different @xmath4-site hybridization . secondly , the electronic structure of the correlated v  @xmath5 states is investigated as a function of distance into the sample from the surface .",
    "this was achieved by varying the photon energy of the haxpes measurements , and by comparison with previous surface - sensitive ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) and unambiguously bulk - sensitive rxes measurements .",
    "particular attention was paid to the _ energetics _ of the hubbard subbands , which are one of the key properties in identifying the evolution of correlated behavior .",
    "we find that spectra recorded at 2.2  kev excitation energy still contain a large surface contribution of 30  40% , despite photoelectrons at this energy often being considered bulk probes of correlated materials . however , we show that photoelectrons at 4.2  kev are found to essentially probe the bulk electronic structure .",

    "[ f : depth ] , the evolution in energy of the lhb from the surface ( ups ) to the bulk ( 4.2  kev haxpes ) can be clearly seen , as well as the agreement in energy of the lhb in the bulk haxpes and the rxes spectra .    in summary ,",
    "our results illustrate the evolution in correlated electron behavior from the surface of cavo@xmath2 and sr@xmath9ca@xmath9vo@xmath2 to the bulk .",
    "spectra at 4.2  kev agree very well with truly bulk sensitive rxes measurements , and are considered representative of the bulk correlated electronic structure . on the other hand , spectra at 2.2  kev",
    "are in good agreement with those at soft x - ray energies,@xcite but are not bulk - like and still contain a surface signal of 30  40% .",
    "we also find that reliable surface and bulk components can not be extracted from intermediate spectra , indicating that either the surface layer is not a discrete overlayer to the bulk , or that detected photoelectrons do not originate from an exponential distribution within the sample .",
    "signatures of evolving electron correlations are observed in both the spectral weight of the qp and lhb and in the binding energy of the lhb . at both the surface and in the bulk",
    ", cavo@xmath2 is found to be `` more correlated '' than sr@xmath9ca@xmath9vo@xmath2 : the correlated lhb of cavo@xmath2 exhibits greater spectral weight and is located closer to @xmath8 than in sr@xmath9ca@xmath9vo@xmath2 , in good agreement with predictions from dmft of cavo@xmath2 and srvo@xmath2.@xcite at the surface , the spectral weight of the lhb of both compounds is enhanced , and is @xmath61% closer to @xmath8 than in the bulk , indicating significantly stronger electron correlations at the surface .",
    "this result is in very good agreement with dmft calculations of the sro - terminated srvo@xmath2(001 ) surface , which indicate a 25  40% decrease in binding energy of the lhb at the surface.@xcite",
    "we have presented a detailed haxpes study of the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "measurements of the valence band have been quantitatively compared with _ ab initio _ calculations within the lda , and are found to be in good agreement after some modest empirical adjustments to the orbital - dependent photoionization cross - sections , with the @xmath4-site hybridization in the o  @xmath3 manifold mostly responsible for the differences between compounds .",
    "secondly , our results on the correlated v  @xmath5 bands support cavo@xmath2 as being a `` more correlated '' metal than srvo@xmath2 , and illustrate the significant enhancement in electron correlations at the surface compared with the bulk .",
    "the results are found to be in good agreement with dmft predictions of the evolution in the spectral function with @xmath7 and between the surface and the bulk .",
    "finally , we resolve the long - standing controversy of efforts to extract bulk information from pes by showing that photoelectrons of @xmath10  kev are required to obtain truly bulk - representative spectra .",
