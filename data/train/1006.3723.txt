    "multifragmentation is a universal phenomenon occurring when a large amount of energy is deposited in a nucleus .",
    "it has been observed in nearly all types of high - energy nuclear reactions induced by hadrons , photons , and heavy ions ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at low excitation energies ,",
    "the produced nuclear system can be treated as a compound nucleus  @xcite which decays via evaporation of light particles or fission . however , at high excitation energy , possibly accompanied by compression during the initial dynamical stage of the reaction  @xcite , the system will expand to subsaturation densities , thereby becoming unstable , and will break up into many fragments .",
    "multifragmentation has been shown to be a fast process with characteristic times around 100 fm/@xmath3 or less ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , as evident from numerous analyses of experimental data , a high degree of equilibration can be reached in these reactions . in particular ,",
    "chemical equilibrium among the produced fragments is very likely while kinetic equilibration may not be reached  @xcite .",
    "statistical models were found very suitable for describing the measured fragment yields @xcite .",
    "even though equilibration may not occur within the individual system during the primary reaction stage the processes are , apparently , of such complexity that dynamical constraints beyond the conservation laws do not restrict the statistical population of the available partition space .",
    "taking multifragmentation into account is crucially important for a correct description of fragment production in high - energy reactions . depending on the chosen projectile , it is responsible for 10 to 50% of the reaction cross section .",
    "multifragmentation , furthermore , opens a unique possibility for investigating the phase diagram of nuclear matter at temperatures @xmath4  mev and densities around @xmath5 ( @xmath6 @xmath7 denotes the nuclear saturation density ) .",
    "these equilibrium conditions coincide with those of the nuclear liquid - gas coexistence region .",
    "very similar conditions are realized in stellar matter during the expansion phase of supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the study of multifragmentation thus receives a strong astrophysical motivation from its relation to stellar evolution and the formation of nuclei , occurring at densities near or below @xmath8 and over a wide range of isotopic asymmetries .",
    "the characteristics of multifragmentation as a function of the neutron - to - proton ratio @xmath0 of the disintegrating system are , therefore , of particular interest .",
    "previous aladin experimental data have provided extensive information on charged fragment production in multifragmentation reactions  @xcite . in particular , they have demonstrated a `` rise and fall '' of multifragmentation with excitation energy  @xcite , and they have shown that the temperature remains nearly constant , around @xmath9  6  mev , during this process  @xcite , as predicted within the statistical approach  @xcite .",
    "the observed large fluctuations of the fragment multiplicity and of the size of the largest fragment in the transition region from a compoundlike decay to multifragmentation have been interpreted as manifestations of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition in small systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references given therein ) .    in this article , the study of multifragmentation is extended to isotopic effects .",
    "new data for projectile fragmentation at 600 mev / nucleon are presented together with their statistical analysis within the framework of the statistical multifragmentation model  @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained during the aladin experiment s254  @xcite in which a maximum range in @xmath0 was explored by using primary stable beams as well as secondary radioactive beams , up to the presently achievable limit on the neutron - poor side .",
    "the projectile isotopic compositions are expected to be essentially preserved during the initial stages of the collision , so that the study can fully benefit from the asymmetry of available secondary beams .",
    "the mass of the produced spectator systems varies considerably with the impact parameter and is closely linked to the transferred excitation energy .",
    "the theoretical analysis is , therefore , based on calculations for a full ensemble of spectator systems intended to reflect these properties of spectator fragmentation .",
    "the parameters describing the ensemble of excited nuclei are chosen to obtain a best possible reproduction for a set of experimental observables .",
    "we concentrate on observables describing the partition degrees of freedom and on the information they carry regarding the fragment properties at the chemical freeze - out . it is shown that a very satisfactory description of the @xmath0 dependence of multifragmentation can be obtained within the statistical framework , including that of the freeze - out temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the symmetry term coefficient in the low - density freeze - out environment , reported for @xmath10c - induced reactions on @xmath11sn isotopes  @xcite , is confirmed and found necessary to reproduce the measured mean neutron - to - proton ratios @xmath12 and the isoscaling parameters of intermediate - mass fragments .",
    "the aladin experiment s254 , conducted in 2003 at the gsi schwerionen synchrotron ( sis ) , was designed to study isotopic effects in projectile fragmentation at relativistic energies .",
    "besides stable @xmath13sn , neutron - poor secondary sn and la beams were used to extend the range of isotopic compositions beyond that available with stable beams alone .",
    "the radioactive secondary beams were produced at the fragment separator frs  @xcite by the fragmentation of primary @xmath14nd projectiles of about 900 mev / nucleon in a thick beryllium target .",
    "the frs was set to select @xmath13la and , in a second part of the experiment , also @xmath15sn projectiles which were then delivered to the aladin experimental setup .",
    "all beams had a laboratory energy of 600 mev / nucleon and were directed onto reaction targets consisting of @xmath16sn with areal density 500 or 1000 mg/@xmath17 .",
    "[ tbh ]        for the runs with secondary beams , to reach the necessary beam intensity of about 10@xmath18 particles / s with the smallest possible mass - to - charge ratio @xmath19 , it was found necessary to accept a distribution of neighboring nuclides together with the requested @xmath13la or @xmath15sn isotopes .",
    "the mean compositions of the nominal @xmath13la ( @xmath15sn ) beams were @xmath20 = 56.8 ( 49.7 ) and @xmath21 = 2.19 ( 2.16 ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "model studies confirm that these @xmath21 values are also representative for the spectator systems emerging after the initial stages of the reaction  @xcite .",
    "[ htb ]        the aladin experimental setup has been described previously  @xcite . for the present experiment ,",
    "it has been upgraded by constructing a new set of eight proportional readout chambers for the tp - music iv detector and by a redesign of all components of the electronic readout chain  @xcite .",
    "digitization of the linear signals was performed with the aid of 40-mhz sampling adc s right after the preamplifier stage , permitting digital filtering and background suppression .",
    "the readout planes on either side of the tp - music iv chamber were divided into four proportional - counter sections and three ionization - anode sections .",
    "each section extended over the full height of the chamber , and proportional and ionization sections alternated along the beam direction . with this arrangement ,",
    "either type of detector could be used to record the fragment trajectories .",
    "their horizontal coordinates , i.e. in the bending plane of the magnet , were obtained from the measured drift times while the vertical coordinates were determined from the positions along the proportional counters measured with a combination of charge - division and pad - readout techniques .",
    "the threshold for fragment detection and identification was below atomic number @xmath22 , obtained with the proportional counters .",
    "the threshold of the ionization sections was higher but they provided a superior @xmath23 resolution for @xmath24 .",
    "overall , the resolution @xmath25 ( full width at half maximum ) of the full detector was nearly independent of @xmath23 up to the projectile @xmath23 and permitted the individual identification of detected fragments according to their atomic number @xmath23 .",
    "examples of recorded inclusive @xmath23 spectra for the cases of stable @xmath13sn projectiles and radioactive @xmath15sn ( nominal ) projectiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_exp ] . they are given on an absolute scale but the recorded cross sections for very large fragments ( about @xmath26 ) are underestimated due to inefficiencies of the experimental trigger as discussed further below .",
    "the figure also shows that all elements are produced in multifragmentation reactions with an intensity that varies rather smoothly with @xmath23 . for @xmath13sn ,",
    "the recorded inclusive cross section for the production of fragments with @xmath27 is 5.9 b. charge pickup to @xmath28 appears with 8 mb in the spectrum , a value fitting well into the systematics collected for this process  @xcite .",
    "very similar cross sections were obtained for @xmath15sn projectiles .",
    "the most significant difference is the lower intensity near the atomic number of the projectile in the case of @xmath15sn , following from the reduced probability for neutron evaporation of neutron - poor heavy residue nuclei ( see below ) .",
    "traces of the neighboring nuclides in the nominal @xmath15sn beams are visible around @xmath29 .",
    "smaller differences are observed in the range @xmath30 where the odd - even @xmath23 staggering is slightly more pronounced , on the level of 10% , in the @xmath15sn case .",
    "the magnetic rigidities of detected fragments were determined by backtracing their trajectories through the magnetic field region of the aladin magnet , starting from the vectors determined with the tp - music iv detector . with an iterative procedure ,",
    "the rigidity was varied until the calculated trajectory coincided with the measured coordinates of the projectile in the target plane , perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "a thin plastic detector of 200 @xmath31 m in thickness , positioned close to the target and viewed by photomultipliers at four sides , was used for this purpose .",
    "the achieved position resolution amounted to @xmath32  mm , horizontally and vertically , over the active area of 4 x 4 @xmath17 chosen for the secondary beam experiments .    the fragments , with velocities of approximately that of the projectile ,",

    "fragment momenta were determined from the measured rigidities and atomic numbers @xmath23 and used to determine fragment masses by including the time - of - flight information given by the aladin time - of - flight wall  @xcite .",
    "the obtained time - of - flight resolution varied with @xmath23 , smoothly decreasing from @xmath33  ps ( standard deviation ) for lithium fragments to @xmath34  ps for fragments with @xmath35 .",
    "the start time was derived from the projectile arrival time measured with a second thin plastic foil of 75 @xmath31 m thickness , mounted upstream at an angle of 45@xmath36 with respect to the beam direction and viewed by two photomultiplier tubes .",

    "[ htb ]        the obtained mass resolution is about 3% for fragments with @xmath38 ( standard deviation ) , decreases to 1.5% for @xmath39 , and was found to be the same in the experiments with stable and radioactive beams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a_exp ] ) .",
    "masses are individually resolved for fragments with atomic number @xmath40 . for optimum resolution ,",
    "correct timing signals from both the front and the back layer of the time - of - flight wall had to be required .",
    "background - free mass spectra , without spurious peaks due to misidentified charges , were obtained by requiring that the @xmath23 values delivered by the tp - music iv and the two layers of the time - of - flight wall all coincided within @xmath41  units of the adopted integer value . because of the dead zones between adjacent scintillator slats and the reduced charge resolution of the time - of - flight wall for larger @xmath23 , this condition was met by one - half to one - fourth of the fragments with @xmath2 .",
    "the cross section distributions shown in fig .  [ fig : a_exp ] are , therefore , normalized with respect to the recorded @xmath23 yields .",
    "the significant differences of the isotope yields for neutron - poor and neutron - rich systems are evident .",
    "they are largest for the weaker but still identifiable peaks such as , e.g. , @xmath42b on the neutron - poor or @xmath10be and @xmath43c on the neutron - rich side of the spectra .",

    "the acceptance of the aladin forward spectrometer , in the geometry of the present experiment , was @xmath44 for @xmath45 fragments with beam velocity in the horizontal direction , i.e. in the bending plane , and @xmath46 in vertical direction . at the beam energy of 600 mev ,",
    "this corresponded to an acceptance increasing with @xmath23 from about 90% for projectile fragments with @xmath47 to values exceeding 95% for @xmath48 .",
    "these values were obtained by fitting the measured momentum distributions in transverse directions with gaussian functions and by estimating the yields lost in the tails .",
    "very similar acceptances have been observed in earlier experiments at the same beam energy  @xcite .    because of the selective coverage of the projectile - spectator decay , the quantity @xmath49 defined as the sum of the atomic numbers @xmath50 of all detected fragments with @xmath51 2 has been chosen as the principal variable for event sorting .",
    "@xmath49 represents approximately the charge of the primary spectator system , apart from emitted hydrogen isotopes , and is monotonically correlated with the impact parameter of the reaction @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy per nucleon of the spectator system is inversely correlated with @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "trigger signals for reactions in the target were derived from four plastic - scintillator paddles , each 5 mm thick , of 8 x 50 @xmath17 active area , and viewed by photomultiplier tubes at both ends .",
    "they were positioned approximately 50 cm downstream from the target at angles outside the acceptance of the spectrometer .",

    "[ fig : trig ] in which the rate of interaction triggers obtained in this way is compared to the expected event rate .",
    "the latter was obtained by subtracting event rates recorded with and without a reaction target from each other .",
    "the most notable deviation from the expected rate is seen at large @xmath49 at which the expected yields increase rapidly while the cross section recorded with the interaction trigger remains fairly flat as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "a rise of the cross section is expected on the basis of the reaction geometry as shown in the figure .",

    "the geometric prediction falls considerably below the measured yields because emitted hydrogen isotopes are not counted in @xmath49 , but probably also because the sharp - edge spherical geometry is less realistic for the more central collisions .",

    "the fluctuations at small @xmath49 are caused by multi - alpha events which enhance the even channels .",

    "in the scenario assumed for the statistical analysis , the multifragmentation process is subdivided into ( 1 ) a dynamical stage leading to the formation of an equilibrated nuclear system , ( 2 ) the disassembly of the system into individual primary fragments , and ( 3 ) the subsequent de - excitation of the hot primary fragments .",
    "for the description of the nonequilibrium stage of peripheral heavy - ion collisions , a variety of models can be used .",

    "a relation between the volume and surface capacitances of nuclei for absorbing asymmetry @xmath195 was derived by danielewicz and lee  @xcite , while kolomietz and sanzhur have used a variational approach using skyrme forces to derive equilibrium values for the volume symmetry term with surface and curvature corrections for nuclei along the @xmath184-stability line  @xcite .",

    "the obtained results show similar trends .",
    "the smaller fragments produced at higher excitations cause the effective mean symmetry term to decrease with decreasing @xmath49 in all four cases but at a slower rate than that resulting from the isoscaling analysis of the experimental yield ratios .",

    "[ sec : cha ] ) , combined with the volume - symmetry coefficient @xmath196  mev of the mass formula of myers and swiatecki  @xcite . as expected , the drop with decreasing @xmath49 is faster because of the larger surface - symmetry coefficient and close to that deduced from the isoscaling analysis . within their larger uncertainty ,",
    "the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the charge observables are thus consistent with those obtained from the isoscaling analysis of the measured isotope distributions . increased surface effects",
    "are expected if deformations and exotic shapes are present among the smaller fragments at the chemical freeze - out .",
    "the symmetry - term coefficients of the amd ground - state nuclei follow the trend exhibited by the other mass formulas . however , for excited nuclei at the breakup stage , a reduced volume term and an isospin - independent surface term for the larger imf s were found in the amd study  @xcite . from this result and from the @xmath145 analysis of fragment charge yields",
    "@xcite one may conclude that the strong decrease of @xmath133 with decreasing @xmath49 is unlikely to result from a surface effect alone .",
    "in fact , the surface term should decrease also for fragments in close vicinity of other nuclei because of residual interactions .",
    "the reduced symmetry term will then have to originate from a decrease of the overall matter density caused by the expansion of the system  @xcite and leading to expanded or deformed shapes of fragments as they are produced .",
    "these effects should be considered in the amd model but were , perhaps , not tested over the full range of possible excitations in ref .",

    "different degrees of reduction are deduced with the different methods .",
    "the lowest values for @xmath133 are obtained from the isoscaling analysis .",
    "the @xmath197  mev obtained for the center of the fragmentation regime , i.e. @xmath198 , is to be compared to 13 mev , corresponding to @xmath153  mev but carrying a large uncertainty , and to @xmath139  mev which provided the best global agreement with the charge and isotope observables studied in secs .",
    "[ sec : cha ] and  [ sec : iso ] .",
    "an answer may come from the fact that isoscaling is more sensitive to the widths of the isotope distributions and thus may give a larger weight to their tails .",
    "these quantities , on the other hand , may more strongly depend on the realization chosen for the secondary decay stage of the reaction . as discussed above , values below 14  mev are favored by the odd - even structure of @xmath12 for @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_int ] ) .",
    "[ tbh ]        the global @xmath139  mev seems close to the effective coefficient @xmath199  mev obtained from the parametrizations of myers and swiatecki or danielewicz and lee , including only surface effects of isolated nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ghot ] ) .",
    "however , the difference is significant .",
    "smm calculations using the coefficients of myers and swiatecki for the fragment description throughout , i.e. , at breakup as well as during the secondary decay stages , lead to significantly smaller @xmath12 , as shown for the @xmath13sn and @xmath13la systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : noverz_ms ] .",
    "they are not sufficient to reproduce the observed neutron richness of light fragments .",
    "when searching for possible reasons for these large differences it was found that the reduction of @xmath133 lowers the @xmath200-value for proton emission while this is not the case with the myers - swiatecki parameters . the relative probability for proton emission",
    "is thus enhanced , leading to more neutron - rich daughter nuclei .",
    "new results from a systematic study of the @xmath0 dependence of projectile fragmentation at an incident energy of 600 mev / nucleon have been presented . by employing radioactive secondary beams ,",
    "a large range of isotopic compositions has been explored , up to the present technical limit .",
    "global fragmentation observables were found to depend weakly on the projectile @xmath0 while substantial differences are observed for the isotope distributions of light fragments ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the significance of the measured charge and mass yields and correlations was investigated with the smm by performing ensemble calculations accounting for the mass - energy correlation of the produced spectator nuclei .",
    "the ensemble parameters were determined empirically by searching for an optimum reproduction of the measured fragment @xmath23 yields and correlations . the sensitivity of the liquid - drop parameters of the fragment description in the hot freeze - out environment was studied and , as a main result , a significant reduction of the symmetry - term coefficient @xmath133 was found necessary to reproduce the mean neutron - to - proton ratios @xmath12 and the isoscaling parameters of @xmath2 fragments . with @xmath139",
    "mev a globally good reproduction was obtained while even lower values are suggested by some observations .",
    "studied as a function of the impact parameter , @xmath133 is found to decrease rapidly as the multiplicity of fragments and light particles from the disintegration of the produced spectator systems increases .",
    "the reduction is larger than that expected from the decreasing fragment size and the correspondingly larger surface effects as modeled with standard mass formulas .",
    "it is interpreted as resulting from the overall reduced density of the system at breakup and the modified fragment properties in the hot environment .",
    "deformations and reduced fragment densities at chemical freeze - out contribute to producing the observed yields of neutron - rich fragments which , according to the present investigation with the smm , are particularly sensitive to the widths of the isotope distributions and thus to the symmetry - energy term at freeze - out .    the reproduction of the experimental data with the smm ensemble calculations is found to be very satisfactory . a global normalization on the level of the @xmath49-sorted event distributions was found sufficient for reaching an overall quantitative description of the @xmath23 and @xmath100 resolved fragment yields .",
    "the calculations have , therefore , also been used to address open questions regarding the isotopic compositions and temperatures of the system at the freeze - out stage .",
    "the @xmath0 independence of the breakup temperatures in the fragmentation regime , obtained from double - isotope yields of light fragments , is quantitatively reproduced by the microscopic smm temperature .",
    "the good agreement suggests that the opening phase space is sufficient to initiate the transition from predominantly residue formation to multi - fragment breakups as the transferred energy increases .",
    "changes of the isotopic evolution of the spectator system between its formation during the initial nucleon - nucleon cascades and its subsequent breakup have been ruled out as alternative explanations for the isotopic fragment compositions .",
    "a reduced difference of the system @xmath0 at breakup will result in smaller isoscaling parameters but , at the same time , require even larger reductions of the symmetry - term coefficient in order to reproduce the mean @xmath12 of intermediate - mass fragments .",
    "it is finally emphasized that the simultaneous analysis of several observables obtained from a nearly complete coverage of the spectator kinematic regime has been important for reaching the presented conclusions .",
    "the deduced modifications of hot fragments in the low - density freeze - out environment and in the presence of other fragments and nuclei can be expected to influence the modeling of astrophysical processes .",
