    "in hierarchical models of structure formation , there is a correlation between halo formation and abundances and the surrounding large scale structure  the mass function in dense regions is top - heavy ( mo & white 1996 ; sheth & tormen 2002 ) .",
    "galaxy formation models assume that the properties of a galaxy are determined entirely by the mass and formation history of the dark matter halo within which it formed .",
    "thus , the correlation between halo properties and environment induces a correlation between galaxy properties and environment .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to test if this statistical correlation accounts for most of the observed trends between luminosity and environment ( luminous galaxies are more strongly clustered ) , or if other physical effects also matter .",
    "we do so by using the statistics of marked correlation functions ( stoyan & stoyan 1994 ; beisbart & kerscher 2002 ) which have been shown to provide sensitive probes of environmental effects ( sheth & tormen 2004 ; sheth , connolly & skibba 2005 ) .",
    "the halo model ( see cooray & sheth 2002 for a review ) is the language currently used to interpret measurements of galaxy clustering . sheth ( 2005 )",
    "develops the formalism for including marked correlations in the halo model of clustering , and skibba & sheth ( 2005 ) extend this to describe measurements made in redshift space .",
    "this halo model provides an analytic description of marked statistics when correlations with environment arise entirely because of the statistical effect .",
    "section  [ mocks ] describes how to construct a mock galaxy catalog in which the luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of clustering are the same as those observed in the sloan digital sky survey . in these mock catalogs ,",
    "any correlation with environment is _ entirely _ due to the statistical effect .",
    "section  [ model ] shows that the halo model description of marked statistics provides a good description of this effect , both in real and in redshift space .",
    "section  [ sdss ] compares measurements of marked statistics in the sdss with the halo model prediction .",
    "the comparison provides a test of the assumption that correlations with environment arise entirely because of the statistical effect .",
    "a final section summarizes our results , and shows that marked statistics provide interesting information about the correlation between galaxies and their environments without having to separate the population into the two traditional extremes of ` cluster ' and ` field ' .",
    "zehavi et al . ( 2005 ) have measured the luminosity dependence of clustering in the sdss ( york et al .",
    "2000 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "they interpret their measurements using the language of the halo model ( see cooray & sheth 2002 for a review ) . in particular , they describe how the distribution of galaxies depends on halo mass in a @xmath4cdm model with @xmath5 which is spatially flat . in this description , only sufficiently massive halos ( @xmath6 ) host galaxies . each sufficiently massive halo hosts a galaxy at its centre , and may host satellite galaxies .",
    "the number of satellites follows a poisson distribution with a mean value which increases with halo mass ( following kravtsov et al .",
    "in particular , zehavi et al .",
    "report that the mean number of galaxies with luminosity greater than @xmath7 in halos of mass @xmath8 is @xmath9^{\\alpha(l ) }   \\label{sdssng}\\ ] ] if @xmath10 , and @xmath11 otherwise . in practice",
    ", @xmath12 is a monotonic function of @xmath7 ; we have found that their results are quite well approximated by @xmath13 @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "later in this paper we will also study a parametrization in which the cutoff at @xmath16 is less abrupt : @xmath17         + n_{\\rm sat}(>l|m)\\nonumber\\\\   n_{\\rm sat}(>l|m ) & = & \\left[{m\\over m_1(l)}\\right]^{\\alpha(l)}.   \\label{sdssnerfc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is motivated by the fact that semi - analytic galaxy formation models show smoother cut - offs at low - masses ( sheth & diaferio 2001 ; zheng et al .",
    "2005 ) , and that parameterizations like this one can also provide good fits to the sdss measurements ( zehavi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we use the model in equation  ( [ sdssng ] ) to populate halos in the @xmath18 outputs of the vls @xmath4cdm simulation ( yoshida , sheth & diaferio 2001 ) as follows .",
    "we specify a minimum luminosity @xmath19 which is smaller than the minimum luminosity we wish to study .",
    "we then select the subset of halos in the simulations which have @xmath20 .",
    "we specify the number of satellites each such halo contains by choosing an integer from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath21 .",
    "we then specify the luminosity of each satellite galaxy by generating a random number @xmath3 distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 , and finding that @xmath7 for which @xmath22 .",
    "this ensures that the satellites have the correct luminosity distribution . finally , we distribute the satellites around the halo centre so that they follow an nfw profile ( see scoccimarro & sheth 2002 for details )",
    ". we also place a central galaxy at the centre of each halo .",
    "the luminosity of this central galaxy is given by inverting the @xmath12 relation between minimum mass and luminosity .",
    "we assign redshift space coordinates to the mock galaxies by assuming that a galaxy s velocity is given by the sum of the velocity of its parent halo plus a virial motion contribution which is drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with dispersion which depends on halo mass ( following equation  [ sigmavir ] below ) .",
    "we insure that the centre of mass motion of all the satellites in a halo is the same as that of the halo itself by subtracting the mean virial motion vector of satellites from the virial motion of each satellite ( see sheth & diaferio 2001 for tests which indicate that this model is accurate ) .",
    "the resulting mock galaxy catalog has been constructed to have the correct luminosity function ( figure  [ lf ] ) as well as the correct luminosity dependence of the galaxy two - point correlation function .",
    "in addition , note that the number of galaxies in a halo , the spatial distribution of galaxies within a halo , and the assignment of luminosities all depend only on halo mass , and not on the surrounding large - scale structure .",
    "therefore , the mock catalog includes only those environmental effects which arise from the environmental dependence of halo abundances",
    ".     refers to the absolute magnitude in the @xmath2band .",

    "2003 ) . ]    for reasons described by sheth , connolly & skibba ( 2005 ) , the marked correlation function we measure in the mock catalogs is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the two - point correlation function in redshift space , and @xmath25 is the same sum over galaxy pairs separated in redshift space by @xmath26 , but now each member of the pair is weighted by the ratio of its luminosity to the mean luminosity of all the galaxies in the mock catalog .",
    "( schematically , if the estimator for @xmath27 is @xmath28 , then the estimator for @xmath29 is @xmath30 , so the estimator we use for @xmath8 is @xmath31 . )",
    "this measurement of @xmath32 represents the prediction of the ` standard ' model : the shape of the luminosity weighted correlation function includes the effects of the statistical correlation between halo mass and environment , but no other physical effects .",
    "this section shows how to describe the marked correlation in redshift space discussed above in the language of the halo model .",
    "details are in skibba & sheth ( 2005 ) ; in essence , the calculation combines the results of sheth ( 2005 ) with those of seljak ( 2001 ) .    in the halo model , all mass",
    "is bound up in dark matter halos which have a range of masses .",
    "hence , the density of galaxies is @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the number density of haloes of mass @xmath35 .",
    "the redshift space correlation function is the fourier transform of the redshift space power spectrum @xmath36 : @xmath37 in the halo model , @xmath36 is written as the sum of two terms : one that arises from particles within the same halo and dominates on small scales ( the 1-halo term ) , and the other from particles in different haloes which dominates on larger scales ( the 2-halo term ) .",

    "the real space power spectrum is given by setting the terms in square brackets in equations  ( [ u1 ] ) and  ( [ u2 ] ) for @xmath48 and @xmath49 to unity , and @xmath50 .",

    "thus , the calculation requires an estimate of how the central and the average satellite luminosity depend on @xmath35 .",

    "the mass - to - light ratio of an @xmath35 halo is @xmath66 $ ] : this shows explicitly that the luminosity dependence of the galaxy correlation function constrains how the halo mass - to - light ratio must depend on halo mass .",
    "this halo - mass dependence has been used by tinker et al .",

    "the symbols show measurements from our mock catalogs .",
    "the different quantities scale very differently with halo mass , with the following consequence .",
    "equation  ( [ wk1h2h ] ) treats the central galaxies differently from the others .",

    "note that , in this case , the luminosity weights are the same for the two types of terms  only the number weighting differs .",
    "however , because the mass dependence of @xmath70 is so different from that of the other two terms ( cf .",
    "figure  [ compareml ] ) , marked statistics allow one to discriminate between models which treat the central object as special from models which do not ( e.g. sheth 2005 ) .    .",

    "note that the errors in @xmath79 are strongly correlated with those in @xmath60 , so that the true error in @xmath8 is grossly ( more than a factor of ten ) overestimated if one simply sums these individual errors in quadrature",

    "comparison of these curves with the measurements yields two important pieces of information .",
    "first , on large scales ( @xmath83mpc ) , the solid and dashed curves are identical , and they are in excellent agreement with the measurements .",
    "this indicates the large - scale signal is well described by a model in which there are no additional correlations with environment other than those which arise from the correlation between halo mass and environment .",
    "this is not reassuring , since the mock catalogs were constructed to have no correlations other than those which are due to halo bias .",
    "second , on smaller scales , the solid curves are in substantially better agreement with the measurements than are the dashed curves .",
    "( a @xmath84 estimate of the goodness of fit of the two marked correlation models yields values which smaller by a factor of ten when the central galaxy is treated specially compared to when it is not . ) since the mock catalogs do treat the central galaxies differently from the others , it is reassuring that the halo model calculation which incorporates this difference is indeed in better agreement with the measurements .    .",
    "symbols show the measurements ; smooth curves show the associated halo - model predictions when the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halo is assumed to be different from the others ; dashed curves show the prediction when the central object is not special .",
    "dotted curves show the mean and rms values of the statistic @xmath8 , obtained by after randomizing the marks and remeasuring @xmath8 one hundred times .",
    "dot - dashed curves in show the one- and two - halo contributions to the statistic in our model when the central object in a halo is special . ]    in the next section , we will present measurements of marked statistics in redshift space . to see",
    "if we can use our halo model calculation to interpret the measurements , figure  [ xisvls ] compares measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath32 in the mock catalog with our halo model calculation .",
    "the format is similar to figure  [ xirvls ] : solid curves in the bottom panels show the predicted marked statistic @xmath8 when the central galaxy in a halo is treated differently from the others , and dashed curves show what happens if it is not .",
    "both curves give the same prediction for the unweighted statistic @xmath60 .",
    "the top panel shows that the halo model calculation of @xmath24 is in excellent agreement with the measurements on scales larger than a few mpc , as it was for @xmath76 .",
    "however , it is not as accurate when the redshift separations are of order a few mpc . nevertheless , the model is able to reproduce the factor of ten difference between @xmath76 and @xmath24 on small scales .",
    "we will discuss the reason for the discrepancy on intermediate scales shortly .",
    "similarly , the bottom panel shows excellent agreement between measurements and model for the marked statistic @xmath32 on large scales ( @xmath85mpc ) , both when the central object is treated specially and when it is not .",
    "in addition , the model in which the central object is special is in better agreement with the measurements on small scales .",
    "( a @xmath84 estimate of the goodness of fit of the two marked correlation models yields values which smaller by more than a factor of two when the central galaxy is treated specially compared to when it is not . ) on intermediate scales , however , there is substantial discrepancy discrepancy between the model and the mocks ; the discrepancy is more pronounced for @xmath32 than for @xmath24 .",
    "to study the cause of this discrepancy , dot - dashed lines show the two contributions to the statistic , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , separately .",
    "this shows that it is on scales where both terms contribute that the model is inaccurate .",
    "there are two reasons why it is likely that this inaccuracy can be traced to our simple treatment of the two - halo term .",
    "the suppression of power due to virial motions means that we must model the two - halo term more accurately in redshift - space than in real - space .",
    "our halo - model calculation incorrectly assumes that linear theory is a good approximation even on small scales ( e.g. scoccimarro 2004 shows that this is a dangerous assumption even on scales of order 10 mpc ) and that volume exclusion effects ( mo & white 1996 ) are negligible ( sheth & lemson 1999 discuss how one might incorporate such effects ) . because our mocks make use of both the positions and velocities of the halos in the simulations , they incorporate both these effects .",
    "thus , our simple halo - model likely underestimates @xmath32 on intermediate scales , but overestimates it on smaller scales . since this is in the sense of the discrepancy with the measurements in the mock catalogs , it is likely that this inaccuracy can be traced to our simple treatment of the two - halo term .",
    "we will have cause to return to this discrepancy in the next section , where we use our halo model calculation to interpret measurements of marked statistics in the sdss dataset .",
    "figure  [ rppisdss ] shows @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the unweighted ( solid ) and weighted ( dashed ) correlation functions of pairs with separations @xmath90 and @xmath91 , perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the measurements were made in a volume limited catalog ( 59,293 galaxies with @xmath73 ) extracted from the sdss dr4 database ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "contours show the scales at which the correlation functions have values of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 5 , when averaged over bins of @xmath92mpc in @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this format , due to davis & peebles ( 1983 ) , allows one to isolate redshift space effects on the correlation functions , since these act only in the @xmath91 direction .",

    ", the corresponding real - space quantities would be isotropic .",
    "the figure shows clearly that @xmath79 has a slightly higher amplitude than @xmath60 on the scales shown .     in the sdss .",
    "dotted curves show that the measured correlation functions are significantly anisotropic . ]",
    "the quantity studied in the previous section , for which we have analytic ( halo - model ) estimates , can be derived from this plot as follows .",
    "counting pairs in spherical shells of radius @xmath94 yields the redshift space correlation function @xmath24 .",
    "this measure of clustering is sensitive to the fact that the correlation function in redshift - space is anisotropic ; in particular , it contains information about the typical motions of galaxies within halos ( which are responsible for the elongation of the contours along the @xmath91 direction at @xmath95  mpc ) , as well as the motions of the halos themselves ( which are responsible for the squashing along the @xmath91 direction at @xmath96  mpc ) .",
    "the result of counting pairs of constant @xmath90 , whatever their value of @xmath91 , yields the projected correlation function @xmath97 ; since @xmath90 is not affected by redshift space distortions , this quantity contains no information about galaxy or halo motions , so is more closely related to the real - space correlation function .",
    "figures  [ xisdss ] and  [ projmp ] compare both these quantities with the corresponding halo - model calculations .",
    "figure  [ xisdss ] shows @xmath24 and @xmath32 measured in two volume limited catalogs extracted from the sdss database .",
    "one of these catalogs is the same as that which resulted in figure  [ rppisdss ] , and the other is for a slightly fainter sample ( @xmath98 , with 61,821 galaxies ) .",
    "error bars are estimated by jack - knife resampling , as discussed previously .",
    "the solid curves show the redshift - space halo - model calculation in which central galaxies are special , and dashed curves show the expected signal if they are not .",
    "( recall that both have the same @xmath24 . )    on large scales , both the solid and dashed curves provide an excellent description of the measurements on large scales .",
    "this agreement suggests that correlations with environment on scales larger than a few mpc are _ entirely a consequence of the correlation between halo abundances and environment _ , just as they were in the mock catalogs .",
    "since the model calculation incorporates the assumption that the halo mass function is top - heavy in dense regions , the agreement with the measured @xmath32 provides strong evidence that this is indeed the case .    the discrepancy between the halo - model calculation and the measurements on intermediate scales is similar to the discrepancy between the halo - model and the mock catalogs studied in the previous section .",
    "there we argued that this is almost certainly due to our simple treatment of the two - halo contribution to the statistic .",
    "indeed , the marked statistics in the mock catalogs behave qualitatively like those in the sdss data ( compare figures  [ xisvls ] and  [ xisdss ] ) , suggesting that the discrepancy between the halo - model calculation and the measurements are due to this , rather than to any environmental effects operating on intermediate scales .     in the sdss .",
    "top panel shows the unweighted projected correlation function @xmath97 , and bottom panels show the marked statistic @xmath99 .",
    "smooth curves show the associated projected halo - model predictions ; solid curves are when the central galaxy in a halo is treated differently than the others , whereas this is not done for the dashed curves .",
    "the upper set of dashed and solid curves show halo - model calculations which follow from equation  ( [ sdssng ] ) ; the lower set of curves assume equation  ( [ sdssnerfc ] ) . ]    on small scales , the solid curves are in substantially better agreement with the data than are the dashed curves ( @xmath84 smaller by a factor of four in both plots ) .",
    "evidently , central galaxies are indeed a special population in the data .",
    "this provides substantial support for the assumption commonly made in halo - model interpretations of the galaxy correlation function that the central galaxy in a halo is different from all the others .",
    "however , even the solid curves are not in particularly good agreement with the measurements . before attributing the discrepancy to environmental effects not included in the halo model description , we have explored the effect of modifying our parametrization of the relation between the number of galaxies and halo mass which we use ( equation  [ sdssng ] ) .",
    "figure  [ xisdss ] shows that the parametrization in equation  ( [ sdssnerfc ] ) , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , provides equally good fits to @xmath24 , but a slightly better description of @xmath32 . in this parameterization of the scaling of @xmath102 with halo mass , the minimum halo mass required to host",
    "a galaxy is not a sharp step function .",
    "further evidence in support of the parametrization in which the minimum mass cutoff is not sharp , and in which the central galaxy is different from the others is shown in figure  [ projmp ] .",

    "we showed how to generate a mock galaxy catalog which has the same luminosity function ( figure  [ lf ] ) and luminosity dependent two - point correlation function as the sdss data .",
    "we used the mock catalog to calculate the luminosity - weighted correlation function in a model where all environmental effects are a consequence of the correlation between halo mass and environment ( figures  [ xirvls ] and  [ xisvls ] show results in real and redshift space ) .",
    "we then showed how to describe this luminosity - weighted correlation function in the language of the redshift - space halo model ( equation  [ wk1h2h ] ) .",
    "the analysis showed that estimates of the luminosity dependence of clustering constrain how the mass - to - light ratio of halos depends on halo mass ( equation  [ m2l ] and figure  [ compareml ] ) .",
    "the central galaxy in a halo is predicted to be substantially brighter than the other objects in the halo , and although the luminosity of the central object increases rapidly with halo mass , the mean luminosity of the other objects in the halo is approximately independent of the mass of the host halo .",
    "our analysis also showed that measurements of clustering as a function of luminosity completely determine the simplest halo model description of marked statistics .",
    "in addition , measurements of the marked correlation function allow one to discriminate between models which treat the central object in a halo as special , from those which do not ( figures  [ xirvls ] and  [ xisvls ] ) .",
    "also , in hierarchical galaxy formation models , the marked correlation function is expected to show a signal on large scales if the average mark of the galaxies in a halo correlates with halo mass .",
    "the signal arises because massive halos populate the densest regions ; it is present even if there are no physical effects which operate to correlate the marks over large scales .",
    "we compared this halo model of marked statistics with measurements in the sdss ( figures  [ xisdss ] and  [ projmp ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the model and the measurements on scales smaller than a few mpc provides strong evidence that central galaxies in halos are a special population  in general , the central galaxy in a halo is substantially brighter than the others .",
    "( berlind et al .",
    "2004 come to qualitatively similar conclusions , but from a very different approach . )",
    "substantially better agreement is found for a model in which the minimum halo mass required to host a luminous central galaxy does not change abruptly with luminosity .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with some semi - analytic galaxy formation models , which generally predict some scatter in central luminosity at fixed halo mass ( e.g. sheth & diaferio 2001 ; zheng et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the agreement between the halo model calculation and the data on scales larger than a few mpc indicates that the standard assumption in galaxy formation models , that halo mass is the primary driver of correlations between galaxy luminosity and environment , is accurate . in particular , these measurements are consistent with a model in which the halo mass function in large dense regions is top - heavy , and , on these large scales , there are no additional physical or statistical effects which affect the luminosities of galaxies . in this respect ,",
    "our conclusions are similar to those of mo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , blanton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and abbas & sheth ( 2006 ) , although our methods are very different .",
    "we note in passing that there is a weak statistical effect for which the halo - model above does not account : at fixed mass , haloes in dense regions form earlier ( sheth & tormen 2004 ) .",
    "gao , springel & white ( 2005 ) show that this effect is more pronounced for low mass haloes ( related marked correlation function analyses by harker et al 2006 and wechsler et al .",
    "2006 come to similar conclusions ) .",
    "the agreement between our halo - model calculation and the measurements in the sdss suggests that this correlation between halo formation and environment is not important for the relatively bright galaxy population we have studied here .",
    "this is presumably because these sdss galaxies populate more massive haloes .",
    "comparisons with larger upcoming sdss datasets , with a fainter luminosity threshold ( such as @xmath108 ) , may bear out the correlation between low - mass halo formation and environment .    as",
    "a final indication of the information contained in measurements of marked statistics , figure  [ ugrms ] compares @xmath32 when the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2band luminosities are used as the mark .",
    "the underlying population is the same as that for figures  [ rppisdss][projmp ] : the sample is volume limited to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 is fixed , and only @xmath25 changes with wave - band .",
    "notice that there is a clear trend with wavelength : there is a slight anti - correlation in the @xmath0band , whereas @xmath32 rises slightly with decreasing scale when @xmath1band luminosity is the mark , and the signal is even stronger when @xmath109 is the mark .",
    "this trend with wavelength is qualitatively consistent with the predictions of semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( sheth , connolly & skibba 2005 ) and indicates that the mean @xmath3-band luminosity of the galaxies in a halo depends less strongly on halo mass than does the mean @xmath2band luminosity in a halo ( sheth 2005 ) .",
    "in the models , the @xmath0band luminosity is an indicator of the star formation rate ; our measurements suggest that the correlation between star formation rate and halo mass is weak  if it is an increasing function of halo mass at low masses , then it decreases at larger masses .     in the sdss .",
    "circles , triangles and squares show @xmath32 when the weight is @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0band luminosity respectively .",
    "for clarity , jack - knife error bars are only shown for the @xmath2band measurement , since the uncertainties are similar in the other bands . ]",
    "figure  [ umrgmr ] shows the result of weighting these same galaxies by their colors .",
    "the top panel shows results where the weight is the difference in the absolute magnitudes , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , whereas the weights in the bottom bottom panel were the ratios of the luminosities in two bands .",
    "comparison of the two panels shows the effect on @xmath32 of rescaling the weights while preserving their rank - ordering  while there are quantitative differences , the results in both panels are qualitatively similar .",
    "the @xmath32 measurements shown in the bottom panel are more widely separated because the luminosity ratio involves @xmath112 , which has the effect of weighting the redder galaxies more heavily . in particular",
    ", this analysis indicates clearly that close pairs of galaxies tend to be redder than average .",
    "sheth , connolly & skibba ( 2005 ) show that this is also the case in semi - analytic galaxy formation models .",
    "the measurements shown in figures  [ ugrms ] and  [ umrgmr ] are consistent with models in which galaxies in clusters are more massive and have smaller star formation rates than galaxies in the field . in effect , these figures demonstrate the environmental dependence of galaxy luminosities and colors , without having to divide the galaxy sample up into discrete bins of ` field ' , ` group ' , and ` cluster ' .",
    "thus , marked statistics allow one to study correlations with environment over a continuous range in density , rather than in somewhat arbitrary discrete bins in environment . in this respect ,",
    "our use of marked statistics to quantify and interpret environmental trends is very different from recent approaches which address the same problem .",
    "since marked statistics are simple to measure and interpret , we hope that they will become standard tools for quantifying the correlation between the properties of galaxies and their environments .     in the sdss .",
    "the top panel shows results when the color weight is the difference in absolute magnitudes . in the bottom panel , galaxies were weighted by the ratio of the luminosities in the two bands , so they span a greater range around the mean value .",
    "both panels show that close pairs of galaxies tend to have redder colors , although the difference is clearer when the weights span a greater range around the mean value . ]",
