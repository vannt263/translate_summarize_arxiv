    "the production of heavy quarks in two - photon collisions has interesting aspects .",
    "each of the photons can behave as either a pointlike or a hadronic particle @xcite .",
    "consequently one distinguishes in such collisions direct- ( both photons are pointlike ) , single resolved- ( one photon is pointlike , the other hadronlike ) , and double resolved ( both are hadronlike ) production channels .",
    "the resolved channels require the use of parton densities in the photon , whereas the production via the direct channel is free of such phenomenological inputs and depends only on the qcd coupling and the heavy quark mass .",
    "the heavy mass provides the hard scale for the perturbative analysis and ensures that the separation into direct and resolved production channels is unambiguous even at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) level .",
    "hence production via the direct channel is directly calculable in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and in principle the best way for examining the validity of such an analysis and for confronting the pqcd prediction with experiment .",
    "two - photon collisions can be investigated at @xmath0 colliders , where a large number of equivalent photons is generated .",
    "charm quark production in two - photon collisions has been analysed in many experiments .",
    "one has mainly studied the reaction @xmath1 with neither outgoing lepton tagged ( `` no - tag '' ) , because it proceeds predominantly via the fusion of two equivalent photons to produce open charm ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the existence of the @xmath3 has been inferred either from direct reconstruction @xcite or from unfolding the distribution of soft pions @xcite resulting from its decay . there",
    "have in addition been studies that use soft leptons @xcite and kaons @xcite to tag charm quarks .    due to the low experimental acceptance of heavy quark production in two - photon collisions",
    "this reaction has been studied also theoretically at next - to - leading order in qcd only in the single - particle inclusive case .",
    "ref.@xcite concentrated on the no - tag case , and ref.@xcite on the case where one of the outgoing leptons is tagged . at lep2 and a future @xmath0 linear collider ( nlc )",
    "the higher cms energy and large luminosity will lead to fairly copious production of charm quark pairs .",
    "thus it will become possible to measure both heavy quarks and analyse their correlations .",
    "the study of these correlations constitutes a more comprehensive test of the theory and is our purpose in this letter .",
    "heavy - quark correlations have been investigated theoretically also in hadroproduction @xcite , photoproduction @xcite and electroproduction @xcite , and experimentally in @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the no - tag case and , to eliminate the uncertainties related to the parton densities in the photon , on the direct channel only .",
    "note that the topaz collaboration @xcite has recently shown that the direct channel may be isolated experimentally from the resolved ones by detecting the photon - remnant jet , present in the resolved channels only .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe our method of calculation and in section 3 we show heavy quark correlations for lep2 , and a nlc at a center of mass energy of 500 gev .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this section we describe the method we used to calculate the qcd corrections to the process @xmath4 where @xmath5(@xmath6 ) is a heavy ( anti)-quark .",
    "we want to have full exclusive information about the final state .",
    "our method is a special case of a more general method for performing exclusive higher order qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the born process ( [ bornproc ] ) is described by the differential cross section @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the charge of the heavy quark in units of @xmath9 , @xmath10 the number of colors , and @xmath11 the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the kinematic invariants are defined by @xmath12 the virtual qcd corrections to the born process consist of the interference between the born amplitude ( depicted e.g.  in fig .",
    "a1 in @xcite ) and its one - loop corrections .",
    "explicit results have already been presented in @xcite and we will not repeat the details of the calculation here .",
    "we merely note that we regularized the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities that occur in the virtual corrections by working in @xmath13 dimensions , and absorbed the uv singularities via mass renormalization in the on - shell scheme .",
    "we are then left with only ir singularities , which appear as @xmath14 poles and factorize into a universal factor multiplying the born differential cross section , eq.([bornform ] ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung corrections at nlo are due to the radiation of a gluon from one of the heavy quarks @xmath15 since our method here is a little different from what was done previously in the literature , we give a few more details .",
    "note first of all that when a gluon is radiated from the heavy quark , no collinear singularity occurs , because it is shielded by the heavy quark mass .",
    "we divide up the phase space into a `` soft '' region and a `` hard '' region .",
    "the soft region is defined by the condition @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is an arbitrary cut - off , to be chosen small .",
    "the hard region is the complementary one .    in the hard phase space region",
    ", one can work in 4 dimensions and perform the phase space integrations numerically , allowing for easy implementation of experimental cuts .",
    "as is well known , in the soft region both the phase space and the matrix element factorize in the limit of small @xmath18 . in both cases ,",
    "one of the factors contains the quantum numbers of the gluon , and the other is only related to the lower order process . as a consequence , one may perform the integral of the momentum of the gluon in this region analytically in @xmath19-dimensions .",
    "specifically one must do the integral @xmath20 with the color factor @xmath21 . here",
    "the soft gluon phase space factor is @xmath22^{-{\\epsilon}}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that the expression in square brackets must be positive .",
    "the soft gluon matrix element factor can easily be found in the eikonal approximation , and is @xmath25 thus , upon combining both factors and integrating over the range ( [ sps ] ) , one obtains a universal factor multiplying the differential born cross section ( [ bornform ] ) .",
    "this factor contains @xmath14 poles which cancel against those originating in the virtual corrections .",
    "the soft contribution to the fully differential cross section can then finally be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the dilogarithmic function as defined in @xcite .",
    "finally , one is left with a two - to - two particle contribution ( consisting of the born and soft - plus - virtual corrections ) and the two - to - three particle contribution in the hard region .",
    "each contribution depends on the theoretical cut - off @xmath18 , but as long as @xmath18 is small enough compared to the typical scale of our process , the sum does not .",
    "this we checked explicitly .",
    "using the method described in the previous section we have constructed a monte carlo program for the reaction @xmath30 for direct photons , including the complete @xmath31 corrections , which is fully exclusive in all final state particles .",
    "we checked that we could reproduce the results in @xcite for the total cross section and single particle transverse momentum ( @xmath32 ) and rapidity ( @xmath33 ) distributions for the direct channel .",
    "we only present results for charm quark production because the bottom quark production rate is very much reduced in two - photon collisions due to charge and phase space suppression .",
    "we first list the default choices we made for various parameters for producing the results shown in the rest of this section . to compute @xmath34 we used the two loop expression with @xmath35  gev and @xmath36 active flavors , where @xmath36 is the number of flavors with mass less than the renormalization scale . for the charm quark mass we used @xmath37 gev .",
    "the center of mass energy was chosen to be 175 ( 500 ) gev for lep2 ( nlc ) . for the renormalization scale we took @xmath38 . in the present process",
    "the choice of scale only affects the value of @xmath34 .",
    "we used the weizscker - williams density of @xcite with an anti - tag angle @xmath39 of 30 ( 175 ) mrad for the case of lep2 ( nlc ) . at the nlc beamstrahlung",
    "is expected to play an important rle , so we include its effect here by adopting for its spectrum the expression given in @xcite , with parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 mm @xcite corresponding to the tesla design .",
    "for the nlc we will as default coherently superimpose the weizscker - williams density and the beamstrahlung density , in order to incorporate the case where one photon is of beam- and the other of bremsstrahlung origin .    for most results",
    "we have not used charm - to - d meson fragmentation function . for the cases that we do , which we indicate explicitly , we employed the peterson _",
    "_ parametrization @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 the value given in @xcite for the case of charm .",
    "our interest when including the fragmentation function lies mainly in how it changes the shapes of distributions , rather than their normalization .",
    "hence we choose @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "we will only present one single particle distribution here , since such distributions have already been studied in @xcite .",
    "* figure 1 : * _ single charm quark @xmath32 spectrum at lep2 , comparison of lo , nlo and nlo with fragmentation .",
    "_    fig.1 shows the single particle @xmath32 distribution at lo , nlo , and at nlo with fragmentation .",
    "we see that inclusion of nlo corrections decreases the cross section at large @xmath32 and enhances it at small @xmath32 , and that the application of the fragmentation function softens it considerably .",
    "turning to correlations , we begin by showing distributions which allow a comparison between the lo and nlo calculations . in fig.2",
    "we show the cross section versus the invariant mass @xmath46 of the heavy quark pair for lep2 and nlc at both lo and nlo",
    ".     * figure 2 : * _ @xmath46 distribution for charm for lep2 and nlc at both lo and nlo . _",
    "notice in fig.2 the sizable difference that occurs at both small and large invariant masses when including the nlo corrections .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "consider first the situation where the two photons collide with all the momentum of their parent leptons . denoting the invariant mass of the heavy quark pair in this case by @xmath47 , then at lo @xmath47",
    "is fixed at @xmath48 . at nlo",
    "it may assume smaller values , and there the cross section is positive . for @xmath49 one",
    "has at nlo also a negative contribution coming from the virtual graphs . to go back to the case of lep2 and nlc",
    "we must fold with the photon spectrum .",
    "a given @xmath47 value then contributes to the spectrum for @xmath46 under the restriction @xmath50 , so that at large @xmath46 the lo spectrum is mainly modified by the negative contribution at @xmath51 , and at small @xmath46 by the positive contributions at smaller @xmath52 .    in fig.3",
    "we show the @xmath53 distribution , defined by @xmath54 , at lo and nlo for both lep2 and the nlc .",
    "* figure 3 : * _ @xmath53 distribution for charm and anti - charm quark at lep2 and nlc .",
    "_    here @xmath55 is the azimuthal angle between the charm and anticharm in the plane transverse to the beam axis and @xmath56 is the pseudo - rapidity difference of the two heavy quarks . at lo @xmath57 , but at nlo @xmath53 may also assume values below that .",
    "note that nlo effects seem to be mostly active for @xmath58 .",
    "we now show two distributions which are only non - trivial at nlo ( and higher orders ) . in fig.4",
    "we present the @xmath32 distribution of the charm - anticharm pair , and in fig.5 the azimuthal correlation between the two heavy quarks .",
    "we also show in fig.4 the nlc curves with only beamstrahlung photons and with only weizscker - williams photons for the purpose of comparison .",
    "* figure 4 : * _ @xmath59 distribution for charm and anti - charm quark at lep2 and nlc .",
    "_     * figure 5 : * _ @xmath55 distribution for charm and anti - charm quark at lep2 and nlc . _",
    "one observes in fig.4 that at the nlc charm pairs produced by beamstrahlung photons prefer to have a lower @xmath32 than those due to ww equivalent photons .",
    "this is a consequence of the tesla beamstrahlung spectrum , which is enhanced at small @xmath60 and depleted at large @xmath60 compared to the ww spectrum ( @xmath60 is the momentum fraction of the photon relative to its parent lepton ) .",
    "in fig.5 we see that the @xmath55 distributions are all quite uniform .",
    "we observe however that at the nlc for the case of charm the beamstrahlung contribution dominates the ww one .",
    "finally we comment on the consequences of choosing different values of the renormalization scale @xmath61 and the charm mass @xmath11 . to see how figs.1 - 3 change when varying @xmath61 one can simply rescale the differences between the lo and nlo curves according the change in @xmath34 , whereas in figs.4 and 5 the whole curve will change by an overall factor .",
    "we further remark that choosing a different value for @xmath11 changes mainly the normalizations of the curves shown in this section , but not their shapes .",
    "in this paper we have presented a nlo calculation of heavy quark production in direct two - photon collisions .",
    "we have described our calculation method and presented numerical studies of various correlations between the heavy quarks .",
    "we observed that the inclusion of the nlo corrections significantly modifies the shapes and normalizations of the distributions we studied .",
    "experimentally such studies will be challenging at lep2 due to the low charm acceptance , but they are certainly feasible at a future @xmath0 linear collider .",
