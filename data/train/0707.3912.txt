    "compositeness models  @xcite attempt to explain the hierarchy of masses in the standard model ( sm ) by the existence of a substructure within the fermions .",
    "several of these models predict excited states of the known leptons .",
    "excited leptons ( @xmath2 ) are assumed to have the same electroweak su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , to the vector bosons , but are expected to be grouped into both left- and right - handed weak isodoublets with vector couplings .",
    "the existence of the right - handed doublets is required to protect the ordinary light leptons from radiatively acquiring a large anomalous magnetic moment via the @xmath5 interaction ( where v is a @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 ) .",

    "the cross section is much larger in @xmath19  collsions than in @xmath20  collsions due to the favourable valence u - quark and the helicity enhancement , specific to cc - like processes .",
