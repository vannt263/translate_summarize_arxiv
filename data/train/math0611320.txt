    "the motivating background of this paper can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed symplectic manifold . denote by @xmath1 the group of all hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of @xmath2 this important group carries a natural bi - invariant metric called the hofer metric ( a detailed description of the investigation of this metric structure can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "an analogue of @xmath1 in the case of contact geometry is the group of hamiltonian contactomorphisms @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a contact manifold ( see  @xcite appendix-4 ,  @xcite and  @xcite for basic information on contact manifolds ) .",
    "the groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 are closely related .",
    "however in contrast to the case of @xmath5 , no interesting bi - invariant metrics on the group @xmath6 are known . in  @xcite",
    "eliashberg and polterovich noticed that for certain contact manifold the universal cover of @xmath6 carries a bi - invariant partial order from which we get a natural metric space @xmath7 associated to @xmath6 .",
    "the definition of @xmath7 is somewhat indirect , and its geometry is far from being understood even in the simplest examples .    in this paper",
    "we study the geometry of @xmath7 for certain subgroups of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a prequanization space of a closed symplectic manifold @xmath0 . as we remarked above an important tool",
    "is the establishment of a connection between the geometry of @xmath7 and the geometry of the universal cover of @xmath1 endowed with the hofer metric .    finally let us mention that further developments on this subject appear in  @xcite , where in this work we refer mostly to  @xcite .",
    "a basic idea in this work is the implementation of basic notions from the theory of partially ordered groups , to the universal cover of the groups of contact transformations , of the relevant contact manifolds .",
    "so we start with the following basic definitions and constructions .",
    "let @xmath8 be a group .",
    "a subset @xmath9 is called a _ normal cone _ if    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    we define for @xmath13 that @xmath14 if @xmath15 .",
    "it is not hard to check that this relation is reflexive and transitive .",
    "if the above relation is also anti - symmetric , then we call it a _ bi - invariant partial order _ induced by @xmath16 .",
    "in this situation , an element @xmath17 is called a _ dominant _ if for every @xmath18 there exists @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 notice that the normality of the cone @xmath16 implies that for every @xmath22 @xmath23    let @xmath24 be a dominant and @xmath25",
    ". then the _ relative growth _ of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28    the above limit exists as the reader can check by himself ( see also  @xcite section 1 ) .",
    "now we want to relate a geometrical structure to the function @xmath29 defined above .",
    "denote by @xmath30 the set of all dominants .",
    "we define the metric space @xmath31 in the following way .",
    "first note that @xmath32 we define the function @xmath33 by @xmath34 it is straightforward to check that @xmath35 is non negative , symmetric , vanishes on the diagonal and satisfies the triangle inequality . thus @xmath35 is a pseudo - distance .",
    "define an equivalence relation on @xmath36 by setting @xmath37 provided @xmath38 .",
    "put @xmath39    the function @xmath35 on @xmath36 projects in a natural way to a genuine metric @xmath40 on @xmath7 .",
    "thus we get a metric space naturally associated to a partially ordered groups ( see also  @xcite for more information ) .",
    "let @xmath41 be the symplectic linear group .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 its universal cover with base point @xmath43 , the identity matrix .",
    "we can think of @xmath42 as the space of paths starting at @xmath43 up to a homotopy relation between paths with the same end point . throughout this subsection",
    "we consider the group @xmath8 to be @xmath42 .",
    "next , consider the equation:@xmath44 here , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is a time dependant symmetric matrix on @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the matrix @xmath49 on @xmath47 . the quadratic form represented by the matrix @xmath46 ,",
    "will be called the _ hamiltonian",
    "_ generating @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to verify the following two facts : + * a * ) .",
    "the set of elements @xmath50 in @xmath42 , generated by @xmath51 which are non negative as a quadratic form for each @xmath52 , establishes a normal cone .    *",
    "in particular , those elements which are generated by a * strictly * positive @xmath51 are dominants in @xmath42 .",
    "olshanskii has proved the following theorem ( see  @xcite as a reference and  @xcite as a background source ) .",
    "[ linear n.t.p.o ] in the above setting the cone establishes a non trivial partial order on @xmath42 .    in view of theorem  [ linear n.t.p.o ]",
    "we can explore the metric space @xmath7 .",
    "and indeed we have the following result .",
    "[ main linear theorem ] the metric space @xmath31 , derived from the partial order above , is isometric to @xmath53 with the standard metric .    * remark .",
    "* one can prove theorem  [ linear n.t.p.o ] using a criterion developed in  @xcite .",
    "briefly this criterion says that in order to establish a non trivial partial order it is enough to prove that there is no contractible loop in @xmath54 which is generated by a strictly positive hamiltonian .",
    "we should remark that the criterion appears in a larger context in  @xcite . in our case",
    "the criterion follows from the fact that the maslov index of any positive loop is positive , and hence the loop can not be contractible ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for more information on the maslov index ) .",
    "we start with some preliminary definitions and constructions before presenting the main results of this section ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a prequantization space of a symplectic manifold @xmath0 where @xmath55 \\in h^{2}(m,\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "topologically , @xmath56 is a principal @xmath57-bundle over @xmath58 .",
    "it carries a distinguished @xmath57-invariant contact form @xmath59 whose differential coincides with the lift of @xmath60 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath61 consisting of all contactomorphisms which preserve @xmath59 is called _ the group of quantomorphisms _ of the prequantization space , ( we will give some more basic information at the beginning of section  [ quant section ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath62 the universal cover of @xmath63 , and by @xmath64 the universal cover of @xmath1 relative to the identity .",
    "we have the following important lemma .",
    "[ cw ] there is an inclusion @xmath65 of @xmath64 into @xmath66    let @xmath59 be the contact form of the prequantization .",
    "the field of hyperplans @xmath67 is called the contact structure of @xmath56 .",
    "every smooth function @xmath68 gives rise to a smooth isotopy of diffeomorphisms , which preserve the contact structure , as we now explain .",
    "first , define the reeb vector field of @xmath59 , @xmath69 , to be the unique vector field which satisfies the following equations @xmath70    now given a smooth function @xmath46 as above define @xmath71 to be the unique vector field which satisfies the following two equations @xmath72    it is well known that the elements of the flow generated by @xmath71 preserve the contact structure .",
    "another important fact is that the vector field which correspond to the constant hamiltonian @xmath73 is the reeb vector field , and the flow is the obvious @xmath74 action on @xmath56 .",
    "now , let @xmath75 be any hamiltonian on @xmath58 and let @xmath76 be its hamiltonian vector field .",
    "let @xmath77 be its lift to @xmath56 , by definition @xmath77 is constant along the fibers of @xmath56 .",
    "we claim that @xmath78    to see this we substitute @xmath79 in equation 2 of  .",
    "we get @xmath80 remembering that @xmath81 we have the equation    @xmath82    @xmath83    for every tangent vector to @xmath56 , @xmath84 , we have    @xmath85    @xmath83    @xmath86    now note that @xmath87 this is since @xmath69 is tangent to the fibers of @xmath56 , and since @xmath77 is constant along the fibers , its differential has no vertical component with respect to any local system of coordinates .",
    "thus , we get from equation   the equation    @xmath88 for every tangent vector @xmath84 . now",
    "since the linear map @xmath89 is surjective on every point of @xmath56 , we get the equation @xmath90 the fact that @xmath60 is non degenerate gives the desired equation @xmath91    denote by @xmath92 the set of all time-1-periodic functions    @xmath93.\\ ] ]    it is not hard to check that for every representative , @xmath94},$ ] of an element of @xmath64 there is a unique hamiltonian @xmath95 which generates it .",
    "let @xmath96 be any hamiltonian .",
    "the lift of @xmath96 is the contact hamiltonian @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the projection from @xmath56 to @xmath58 ( note that the function @xmath100 is constant along the fibers of @xmath56 ) .",
    "now , @xmath100 is a contact hamiltonian function of the contact manifold @xmath56 which generates an element of @xmath62 .",
    "it is well known that every representative of an element of @xmath62 , is generated by a unique contact hamiltonian which is a lift of an hamiltonian defined on @xmath101 we further remind the reader that @xmath63 is a central extension of @xmath5 .",
    "that is we have the short exact sequence @xmath102    which is from the lie algebra point of view , the poisson bracket extension of the algebra of hamiltonian vector fields .",

    "the path @xmath108 , in @xmath63 , which is generated by the lift of @xmath107 , @xmath109 , is a lift of @xmath106 .",
    "nevertheless , it is not necessarily closed ( actually it is closed , as we show below ) . it easy to check that there is a constant , @xmath110 , such that @xmath111 generates a lift , @xmath112 , of the loop @xmath106 and this lift is a loop based at the identity of @xmath113 we claim that    * a. * the loop @xmath112 is contractible .    *",
    "b. * the constant @xmath110 equals zero .",
    "we first prove @xmath114 .",
    "since the loop @xmath106 is contractible , there is a homotopy @xmath115 \\times [ 0,1 ] \\rightarrow ham\\ ] ] such that for every @xmath116 , @xmath117 is a contractible loop .",
    "we denote by @xmath118 the normalized hamilonian which generate the loop @xmath119 .",

    "we now prove @xmath124 .",
    "first we remind the reader the calabi - weinstein invariant , which is well defined on the group @xmath125 .",
    "it was proposed by weinstein in  @xcite . for a loop @xmath126 define the calabi weinstein invariant by @xmath127    where @xmath109 is the unique hamiltonian generating @xmath128",
    "now it is clear that @xmath129)=0.\\ ] ]    we conclude that for every @xmath116 @xmath130    @xmath83 @xmath131    now since @xmath132 is normalized for every @xmath116 we get that @xmath133 as desired .",
    "the map of an arbitrary element of @xmath104 is defined in the same manner .",

    "can be shown that this map is well defined .",
    "finally , this map is clearly injective .",
    "the universal cover of @xmath63 carries a natural normal cone @xmath136 consisting of all elements generated by non - negative contact hamiltonians .",
    "the set of dominants consists of those elements of @xmath62 which are generated by strictly positive hamiltonian .",
    "the normal cone always gives rise to a genuine partial order on @xmath62 .",
    "thus one can define the corresponding metric space @xmath31 as it was explained in subsection [ basics on p.o.g ] .",

    "according to  @xcite all we need to check is that there are no contractible loops in @xmath63 which are generated by a strictly positive contact hamiltonian .",
    "such contractible loops can not exists since the calabi - weinstein invariant of any representative of a contractible loop must be zero , and thus can not be generated by a strictly positive hamiltonian .    in light of theorem  [ linear n.t.p.o ]",
