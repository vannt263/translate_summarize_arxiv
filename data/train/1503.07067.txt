    "<S> in this contribution , we present an application of a novel perturbation approach ( denoted as an overset approach ) to a generic turbulent channel flow . the derivation of the governing equations ( the non - linear perturbation equations extended with fluctuating viscous terms ) is presented as well as subgrid - scale modeling aspects which results in the overset les ( oles ) method . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the overset method is illustrated with a generic fully developed turbulent channel flow , the results of which show excellent agreement with reference direct numerical simulation data . </S>",
    "<S> the ability of the overset method to correct for an imperfect background flow is furthermore shown . </S>"
