    "the giant flares produced by highly magnetized neutron stars , `` magnetars , '' are amongst the most energetic of stellar phenomena .",
    "three such flares have been recorded since the advent of satellite borne high energy detectors .",
    "the most recent event , from sgr 1806 - 20 ( hereafter , 1806 ) , was also the most luminous , generating upwards of @xmath2 erg in a matter of minutes @xcite . at its peak",
    "the prodigious photon flux paralyzed almost all satellite instruments which viewed the event .",
    "the magnetic instability which powers such flares is likely associated with large scale fracturing of the neutron star crust @xcite , and will almost certainly excite large scale seismic motions within the star .",
    "recently , @xcite presented evidence from rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) observations of transient , high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) during the pulsating tail of the giant flare from 1806 .",
    "they found 92.5 hz qpos approximately 200 s after the onset of the flare .",
    "these qpos appear to be associated with a spectrally hard , unpulsed emission component , and are only detected during particular rotational phases .",
    "the presence of lower frequency , @xmath3 and @xmath4 hz qpo features was also claimed .",
    "@xcite suggested that these qpos may be due to global oscillation modes of the neutron star .",
    "in particular , they propose an association with torsional ( toroidal ) vibrations of the neutron star crust @xcite .",
    "toroidal oscillations can be readily excited by crust fracturing , as demonstrated by the devastating 2004 sumatra - andaman earthquake @xcite , and have periods within the range observed . coupling to the magnetosphere via the magnetic field threading the crust appears to be a plausible method of modulating the x - ray flux during the flare , but a detailed model of this process is needed .",
    "we note that barat et al .",
    "( 1983 ) suggested torsional vibrations might explain a claimed 23 ms modulation during the initial spike of the march 5 , 1979 flare from sgr 0526 - 66 .",
    "motivated by the work of @xcite we investigated the fast timing properties of the only other giant flare observed with high sensitivity instrumentation ; the august 27 , 1998 event from sgr 1900 + 14 ( hereafter , 1900 , hurley et al . 1999 ) . @xcite carried out a detailed study of the _ bepposax _ and _ ulysses _ data from this flare .",
    "they found a clear signal of the neutron star s spin frequency ( @xmath5 hz ) and its harmonics in power spectra of the event , and modelled the pulsating tail with a trapped fireball model .",
    "@xcite investigated the flare s fast timing properties with _",
    "bepposax _ , but could not search the entire event due to a dearth of high time resolution data . nevertheless , they presented evidence for a power law noise component extending above 100 hz .",
    "in this letter we report the results of a timing study of this flare using the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard rxte .",
    "we detect a transient qpo at @xmath0 hz during a @xmath6 s interval approximately 1 minute after flare onset , and a pair of persistent qpos at 53.5 and 155.5 hz associated with the rotational phase of the 84 hz signal . after describing our timing study",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our findings in the context of neutron star toroidal oscillation modes .",
    "during the august 27 , 1998 flare from 1900 , rxte was pointed at the cataclysmic variable am her , about @xmath7 away from it .",
    "the pca was configured in one of the `` good xenon '' data modes ( goodxenon16s ) with @xmath8 @xmath9s resolution .",
    "this mode was identical to one running at the time of the 1806 flare except for a longer read - out cycle ( 16 s compared with 2 s for 1806 ) that led to data gaps during the flare .",
    "nevertheless , high time resolution , unsaturated data are available for portions of the pulsating tail .",
    "1 shows the lightcurve of the flare from both the standard1 ( bottom ) and goodxenon16s ( top ) modes .",
    "the standard1 mode produces 1/8 s resolution light curves across the full pca bandpass ( nominally 2 - 90 kev ) .",
    "the gaps in the goodxenon16s data occur because the buffer is filled before it can be read out . the buffer can store 16,000 events , and is read out every 16 s , so above a mean rate of @xmath10 s@xmath11 gaps are inevitable .    because of the gaps we first searched each good data interval separately , starting with the first interval following the peak of the flare ( severe deadtime at the peak precludes a meaningful search there ) .",
    "we calculated power spectra with a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz using the good data in each interval .",
    "based on the results of @xcite we averaged the power spectra to @xmath8 hz frequency resolution to best match their reported qpo coherence values .",
    "we did not find any candidate detections in the first three data intervals , however , the power spectrum of the fourth interval ( marked by the vertical dotted lines in fig .",
    "1 ) shows a significant peak at @xmath0 hz .",
    "2 shows the power spectrum from this interval in the 10  2048 hz band at 1 hz resolution .",
    "we estimated the significance using a @xmath12 distribution with 16 degrees of freedom , which is the distribution expected based on the number of independent frequency bins averaged .",
    "we fitted the observed distribution of noise powers with a @xmath12 function and confirmed that it is consistent with the expected noise distribution ( see the inset to fig .",
    "the peak at 84 hz has a single trial probability of @xmath13 based on this noise distribution .",
    "multiplying by the number of frequency bins searched ( 2048 ) and a `` confirmation bias '' reflecting the fact that this was the fourth spectrum searched we arrive at a significance of @xmath14 , a fairly robust detection .",
    "the peak power corresponds to an average amplitude ( rms ) of 10.2% .",
    "we next constructed a dynamic power spectrum using the @xmath15 statistic @xcite .",
    "3 shows a contour plot of this spectrum and the light curve of the fourth data segment .",
    "the 84 hz signal is clearly localized in time near the largest peak of the four - peaked profile that emerged during the pulsating tail @xcite .",
    "although the signal is _ not _ centered on the peak , we can not rule out some association with its right flank .",
    "this behavior is similar to that reported by @xcite , in that the oscillations are not centered on a peak . to quantify the amplitude variation with energy we computed power spectra for different energy bands , restricting the time range to the interval in which the signal was detected .",
    "the amplitude measurements are corrected for background , using data prior to the flare as an estimate of the total background .",
    "the amplitude ( rms ) in the 12  90 kev band is @xmath16 , increasing to @xmath17 for photons above 30 kev . for photon energies",
    "less than 18 kev we have a 90% confidence upper limit of about 14% .",
    "we note that a detailed spectral study of the flare is complicated by the fact that 1900 was not in the pca field of view .",
    "israel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the qpos in 1806 had a dependence on rotational phase . to test for such behavior we computed an average power spectrum using 1.5 s intervals centered on and beginning at the rotational phase of the 84 hz signal .",
    "for the spin period we used the results of woods et al .",
    "the resulting power spectrum from 20 independent intervals is plotted in fig .",
    "4 ( middle and upper curves ) , and clearly shows an additional pair of qpos , and perhaps a third .",
    "the time interval of this spectrum extends about 90 s beyond the 84 hz detection .",
    "we fit this spectrum with a power law continuum and a pair of lorenztian profiles for the two strongest qpos .",
    "this model fits well , with a @xmath18 .",
    "the frequencies of the strongest qpos are @xmath19 and @xmath20 hz , with coherence values @xmath21 of 22 and 55 , respectively .",
    "their average amplitudes ( rms ) are @xmath22 and @xmath23 % .",
    "these qpos are very significant ; removal of the 53 and 155 hz components increases @xmath12 by 72 and 134 , respectively . the middle and top curves in fig .",
    "4 show the same power spectrum at different frequency resolution , 4 and 4/3 hz , respectively . at the higher frequency resolution ( top )",
    "there is a suggestive peak at about 28 hz . including a lorentzian for this feature improves @xmath12 by 22.1 , which is a bit better than a @xmath24 deviation ,",
    "so we consider this a tentative detection .",
    "finally , the strength of these features is a function of rotational phase . to confirm this we computed average power spectra in the same manner but centered on rotational phases _ away _ from that of the 84 hz signal .",
    "4 ( bottom ) shows the average power spectrum for phases centered @xmath25 s from that of the 84 hz signal .",
    "the qpos are clearly not detected .",
    "this analysis also confirms that the detected signals can not be detector artifacts , but must be intrinsic to the source .",
    "our results show striking similarities with those obtained for the 1806 flare by @xcite .",
    "first , we find a frequency within 8% of the 92.5 hz feature in 1806 , suggesting the same underlying mechanism .",
    "second , the strongest signal is transient , appears to be associated with a particular rotational phase and is not centered on a profile peak .",
    "although the 92 hz signal in 1806 persists for longer , this could be due to its larger overall luminosity , and we may have missed occurrences of the 84 hz signal due to data gaps . in both flares",
    "the amplitude is greater at higher photon energies .",
    "however , there is no obvious hard dc component associated with the 84 hz qpo in 1900 , as in 1806 @xcite .",
    "the firm detection of multiple qpos associated with a specific rotational phase provides compelling evidence that the modulations are related to a particular region on the stellar surface , perhaps the site of a crust fracture , or a certain magnetic field bundle .",
    "moreover , the comparisons to 1806 strongly suggest we are seeing a similar phenomenon in 1900 .",
    "@xcite conjectured that toroidal oscillations of the neutron star might explain the observed frequencies .",
    "we now explore the implications of our findings in the context of this model .    for a non - rotating , non - magnetic star , @xcite estimates the period of the fundamental ( @xmath26 ) toroidal mode ( denoted @xmath27 ) to be @xmath28 where @xmath29 km and @xmath30 .",
    "the periods of higher order @xmath31 modes ( @xmath32 modes have frequencies that are too high ) are given by @xmath33^{-1/2 } \\ ; , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where the factor in square brackets is a magnetic correction , @xmath34 g , and @xmath35 is the crustal density in units of @xmath36 g @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite argues that @xmath38 is appropriate since the mode periods are largely set by conditions in the deep crust . in deriving equation ( [ e2 ] )",
    "it is assumed that magnetic tension boosts the crustal shear modulus isotropically . however , the field configuration and corresponding non - isotropic effects could alter the magnetic correction dramatically @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that their 92.5 hz qpo , and a weaker feature at 30.4 hz could be due to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 modes , respectively .",
    "preferential excitement of higher @xmath1 modes is not unreasonable , being set by the fracture geometry : such an effect was seen in the spectrum of earth modes excited by the 2004 sumatra - andaman earthquake @xcite . with at least three frequencies in 1900",
    "we can ask if identification with a sequence of modes of different @xmath1 is plausible .",
    "we find only one reasonably plausible sequence , that where the frequencies are due to the @xmath41 ( 53 hz ) , @xmath42 ( 84 hz ) and @xmath43 ( 155 hz ) modes ( see figure 4 ) . with this sequence",
    "the inferred @xmath40 mode frequency is @xmath44 hz , lower than that for 1806 , but , intriguingly , consistent with the frequency of our tentatively detected 28 hz qpo .",
    "although the mode frequencies in this sequence do not precisely match our qpo centroid frequencies , magnetic field corrections could plausibly account for the modest offsets .",
    "the different inferred @xmath45 mode frequencies imply that the stellar parameters must differ . given an equation of state ( eos ) , equations ( [ e1])-([e2 ] )",
    "specify the relationship between mass and magnetic field necessary to give an oscillation at a desired frequency",
    "5 shows , for several eos , the stellar parameters that give @xmath40 oscillations at 28 hz ( 1900 ) and 30.4 hz ( 1806 ) .",
    "if the stars have similar magnetic field strengths , their masses must differ by more than @xmath46 .",
    "this seems unlikely unless magnetar masses differ significantly from those of other non - accreting neutron stars ; a study of radio pulsars by @xcite found the masses to be consistent with a narrow gaussian distribution , @xmath47 .",
    "more likely the stars have similar masses but different magnetic fields .",
    "if we assume that both stars have masses @xmath48 , we can immediately rule out the softest eos ; and the hardest eos predicts magnetic fields for both systems that are far larger than those inferred from timing studies @xcite . neither the ap3 nor the ap4 eos can be ruled out , given that the inferred @xmath49 mode frequency of 28 hz has a @xmath50 hz uncertainty . however , the magnetic fields that one would infer from these eos agree well with those derived from timing measurements of both stars , which suggests that 1806 has a field strength approximately double that of 1900 @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have explored the radiative mechanisms associated with magnetar flares .",
    "they associate the four - peaked profile during the 1900 flare with x - ray `` jets '' produced by the strong polarization dependence of scattering in the @xmath51 g field .",
    "these jets form close to the surface and likely reflect the multipole structure of the magnetic field .",
    "our detection of qpo signals shortly after the emergence of the four - peaked profile , in association with one of these `` jets '' , is consistent with a mechanism that produces motions at or near the stellar surface .",
    "indeed , the presence of beamed emission offers a plausible scenario to achieve large amplitudes from modest surface displacements .",
    "for example , perturbations to the magnetic field geometry could produce changes in the jet angle with respect to a distant observer , creating a large change in observed flux .",
    "the discovery of high frequency qpos with the right @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] scaling during a second magnetar flare is strong evidence that we may be seeing the influence of global toroidal modes of neutron star crusts on the x - ray emission from these objects .",
    "the recent results suggest these qpos may be ubiquitous , in which case future observations of such flares , which we know will occur , albeit infrequently , could provide a new sensitive probe of neutron star structure .",
    "efforts should be made to see that sensitive instrumentation is in place to observe the next such flare .",
