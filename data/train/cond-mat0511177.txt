    "quantum phase transitions in low - dimensional quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets ( qhafs ) have been the subject of extensive investigations during the last two decades @xcite . the transition from a _",
    "renormalized classical _ to a _ quantum - disordered _ state can be triggered by various parameters , including lattice dimerization , frustration and applied field .",
    "more recently , special interest has focused on phase transitions driven by geometric randomness of the lattice @xcite , including site and bond disorder .",
    "strong geometric disorder not only breaks translational invariance and perturbs the ground state of the pure system , but it can also destabilize renormalized classical phases with long - range order ( lro ) and drive the system to novel disordered phases .",
    "various one - dimensional qhafs with bond disorder have been found to display unconventional quantum phases@xcite .",
    "for example , the undimerized qhaf chain is driven into a _ random - singlet phase _",
    "@xcite with algebraically decaying spin - spin correlations .",
    "the low temperature susceptibility diverges as @xmath1 $ ] in this phase , independent of the details of the bond disorder .",
    "in contrast , a dimerized chain shows a _ _ quantum griffiths phase__@xcite beyond a critical disorder strength , with exponentially decaying spin - spin correlations and a non - universal power - law divergent susceptibility . in two dimensions",
    ", the clean qhaf develops antiferromagnetic ( nel ) lro at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this introduces the intriguing possibility of a genuine order - disorder transition , driven by lattice randomness , i.e. from the nel phase into one of the above unconventional disordered phases @xcite .",
    "site and bond dilution of the square lattice qhaf have been the focus of several recent studies @xcite , motivated by experiments on antiferromagnetic cuprates doped with nonmagnetic impurities @xcite . from a geometric point of view ,",
    "bond and site dilution reduce the connectivity of the lattice , ultimately leading to a percolative phase transition @xcite beyond which the system is broken up into finite clusters . in a classical spin system , this percolation transition is coupled to a magnetic transition with the same critical exponents since spontaneous magnetic order can not survive beyond the percolation threshold . in a quantum spin system , on the other hand , a progressive reduction of the lattice connectivity enhances quantum fluctuations in a continuous fashion , raising the possibility of quantum destruction of magnetic order _ before",
    "_ the percolation threshold is reached .",
    "however , recent studies of homogeneously site- and bond - diluted qhafs on the square lattice @xcite found that the magnetic transition takes place exactly at the percolation threshold , due to the fact that the percolating cluster at threshold shows lro @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents of the correlation length and of the order parameter , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are found to take their classical percolation values@xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case the magnetic transition is completely dominated by classical percolation@xcite .",
    "alternative to the above classical percolation picture is the _ quantum percolation _ mechanism , recently demonstrated in a number of model systems @xcite .",
    "this scenario is based on the fact that spins involved in locally strongly fluctuating quantum states , such as dimer singlets and resonating valence bonds ( rvbs ) , are weakly correlated with the remainder of the system . in a random network of spins ,",
    "the local strongly fluctuating states create _ weak links _ with small spin - spin correlations .",
    "if these weak links are part of the backbone of the percolating cluster , they can prevent the percolating cluster from developing long - range order .",
    "therefore , if lattice dilution favors the local formation of such states , it is possible to drive the system towards a quantum disordered state before the percolation threshold is reached , thus _ decoupling percolation from magnetic ordering_.    in this work we numerically scrutinize this quantum percolation scenario in the @xmath4 qhaf on a square lattice with _ inhomogeneous _ bond dilution @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous character of lattice randomness is the key ingredient to enhance quantum fluctuations , favoring the local formation of rvb / dimer - singlet states .",
    "based on large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations , we observe that the classical percolation scenario is preserved for moderate inhomogeneity , up to a multicritical point beyond which the magnetic transition deviates from the percolation threshold . at this point , the quantum percolation scenario sets in , leading to a novel quantum - disordered phase .",
    "such a phase has very unconventional features , i.e. a _ finite correlation length _ but a _ gapless excitation spectrum _ , and a _ diverging uniform susceptibility _ at zero temperature with a non - universal exponent .",

    "the ground state properties are systematically probed by efficiently cooling the system down to its physical @xmath29 behavior via a successive doubling of the inverse temperature @xmath3 ( ref . ) .",
    "this approach is necessary since in two - dimensional ( 2d ) diluted systems 2d correlations are often mediated by narrow quasi - one - dimensional links , such that the temperature scale at which these correlations set in is much lower than in the clean 2d case .",
    "the scaling analysis of the quantum simulation results is carried out in two complementary ways @xcite . in the first approach ,",
    "the lattice size is fixed at @xmath30 , and the entire system is simulated , including percolating and non - percolating finite clusters . in the second approach , a fundamental theoretical tool is used to ascertain the presence or absence of order in the system : we focus exclusively on the percolating cluster , i.e. discarding the finite clusters that can not carry long - range order . on a finite @xmath30 lattice with periodic boundary conditions",
    "the percolating cluster is identified as the largest cluster , winding around at least one of the two spatial dimensions .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that a single run of qmc simulation evaluates the observables on both the full lattice and the largest ( percolating ) cluster . at the same time the largest cluster has non - negligible size fluctuations ( of order @xmath7 ) , leading to a significant error in the qmc data .",
    "an alternative approach , eliminating these size fluctuations , is to grow the percolating cluster freely from an initial seed up to a fixed size @xmath31 but without any restriction of lattice boundaries . starting from a single occupied bond ,",

    "a fundamental observation @xcite is that the presence or absence of magnetic order in a diluted system and the nature of the transition from order to disorder are determined by the magnetic behavior of the _ _ p__ercolating cluster . in two dimensions ,",

    "the magnetic transitions are located via scaling of the spin - spin correlation length @xmath69 , extracted from the structure factor through the second moment estimator @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneity of bond dilution breaks the discrete rotation symmetry of the lattice , such that two distinct correlation lengths @xmath70 and @xmath71 need to be considered along the @xmath72 and @xmath73 lattice directions . at critical points separating 2d long - range order from disordered phases ,",

    "the scenario of a classical percolation transition in the magnetic hamiltonian is precluded by non - linear quantum fluctuations .",

    "a detailed discussion of the nature of the quantum - disordered phase will be given in sec .",
    "[ gs ] .",
    "the evolution of the critical exponents upon tuning inhomogeneity has been investigated in ref . .",
    "surprisingly , the two multicritical points do not mark an evident discontinuity in the universality class of the model , and the classical percolation exponents appear to persist also for intermediate inhomogeneity beyond the multicritical points , changing to radically different values only in the extreme inhomogeneous limits .",
    "therefore the magnetic _ quantum _ phase transitions close to the multicritical points appear to retain a percolative character .",
    "this result can be understood within the following argument . to destroy the long - range nature of a random network",
    "it is sufficient to cut a few links on its backbone .",
    "this implies that the non - linear quantum fluctuations leading to quantum - disorder on the percolating cluster need only have _ short - wavelength _",
    "components , in contrast to conventional quantum phase transitions in translationally invariant lattices . indeed , strongly fluctuating states appearing on links made of segmented ladders or decorated chains ( see sec .",
    "[ model ] ) have a markedly local effect on magnetic correlations , i.e. they magnetically decouple the portions of the percolating cluster connected through that link .",
    "this effect is equivalent to geometrically removing that link , thus leaving two portions of the cluster disconnected @xcite .",
    "if weak links occur on the backbone of the percolating cluster , this mechanism is sufficient to lead to quantum disorder .",
    "only quantum fluctuations with wavelengths comparable to the length of the weak link are required .",
    "to reestablish magnetic correlations between the two portions of the percolating cluster disconnected by quantum fluctuations , it is then necessary to add more bonds to the cluster in order to find an alternative path for magnetic correlations to spread over the cluster .",
    "since this process is of geometrical character it endows the quantum phase transition with a percolative nature .    the above picture of a percolative quantum phase transition breaks down for strong inhomogeneity .",
    "in this limit , the building blocks of the percolating cluster are the strongly quantum fluctuating substructures depicted in fig .",
    "[ f.qlocal ] , and hence the quantum phase transition is driven by the competition between the energy scale of the gap above the ground state of such substructures and the energy scale of the spatially random couplings between the substructures . in a real - space picture",
    ", the competition occurs between the finite correlation length of the substructures and the characteristic length set by the spacing between the spatially random couplings .",
    "this competition will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "the quantum phase transition is completely disconnected from classical percolation of the lattice , and it is reasonable to expect for it to be in a different universality class , as concluded in ref .  .",
    "so far , the onset of the quantum disordered phases was discussed , approaching them from the homogeneous limit of eq .",
    "( [ e.hamiltonian ] ) . a complementary understanding of the novel quantum phase and the associated quantum phase transitions can be gained by starting from the extreme inhomogeneous limit of randomly coupled ladders ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this limit lends itself to a very simple analysis in terms of the properties of the single spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder .    in the limit of @xmath19 ,",
    "the system is composed of an array of two - leg ladders randomly coupled by @xmath6 bonds .",
    "the probability of activation of a dimer bond is reflected in the average distance @xmath85 of two @xmath6 bonds along a column separating two neighboring ladders , namely @xmath86 .",
    "a single @xmath6 bond is sufficient to connect two ladders geometrically . in other words",
    ", @xmath87 is sufficient to connect all ladder subsystems on a @xmath30 lattice . taking the limit @xmath88 ,",
    "one obtains immediately @xmath89 .",
    "thus geometrically the system percolates at any infinitesimal concentration @xmath90 and the percolating cluster is the entire lattice itself .    -.5 cm    however the system does not develop antiferromagnetic order until a finite value @xmath91 is reached .",
    "this is not surprising since each two - leg ladder has a quantum - disordered ground state with a finite excitation gap .",
    "this gap has to be overcome before the nel ordered state can become the ground state .",
    "a more quantitative argument can be formulated based on the fact that each isolated ladder has a finite correlation length @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "one can imagine a renormalization group transformation that creates effective block spins from all the spins within a correlation volume in such a way that all block spins are perfectly uncorrelated with each other ( see fig .",
    "[ f.rgladder ] ) .",
    "when turning on the @xmath6 bonds , it becomes evident that , to establish long - range correlations in the system , it is necessary to have a string of block spins percolating from one side to the other of the system .",
    "given that all block spins are independent within the same ladder , this is only possible if , on average , each block spin is connected by a @xmath6 bond to both its right and left neighboring block spin .",
    "this requires an average spacing of the @xmath6 bonds of @xmath93 on each column , which in turn leads to the following estimate of the critical concentration of dimer bonds @xmath94 despite the simplicity of the argument , this estimate is surprisingly good : @xmath95 to be compared with the qmc result @xmath96 .",
    "interestingly , this argument can be extended to the case of randomly coupled _ weakly diluted _ ladders , namely for @xmath97 .",
    "the correlation length of the ladder remains the dominant length scale of the problem , as long as it is much smaller than the new length scale introduced by the dilution @xmath98 corresponding to the average length of the ladder segments after dilution .    to test to",
    "which extent the above argument is applicable we performed sse - qmc simulations on a _ single _ bond - diluted two - leg ladder to determine the evolution of the correlation length upon dilution .",

    "this mechanism weakens the correlations along the two legs",
    ". + effect ( c ) has twice the probability compared to the effects ( a ) and ( b ) because there are twice as many leg bonds as rung bonds .",
    "the non - trivial competition between correlation enhancement ( a)-(b ) and correlation suppression ( c ) has the combined effect that in _ bond - diluted _ ladders , the correlation length always remains _ finite _ down to zero temperature .",

    "the finite - range nature of correlations is also clearly shown in the picture , along with the non - monotonic decay of correlations with distance .",

    "this clearly shows that the system is not only gapless , but that its gapless excitations lead to singularities in the response to an external field .",

    "their central feature is the coexistence of short - range correlations together with so - called griffiths - mccoy singularities in the response functions .",

    "in this work , we have investigated the highly non - trivial interplay between quantum fluctuations and geometric disorder realized in the inhomogeneously bond - diluted quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice .",
    "we have observed that the inhomogeneous nature of bond dilution allows for a continuous tuning of quantum fluctuations from _ linear _ to _ non - linear_. inhomogeneity enables us to tune the system from a renormalized classical phase , in which the magnetic transition is purely driven by geometric percolation , to a genuine quantum regime in which the magnetic transition is decoupled from the percolation transition .",

    "bond dilution can , in principle , be realized by vacancies in the non - magnetic lattice , in particular by vacancies on the sites of the non - magnetic ions involved in the superexchange paths .",

    "the doping of the non - magnetic ions involved in the superexchange paths with other non - magnetic species introduces instead bond disorder @xcite , whose effect can in principle be arbitrarily close to that of bond dilution .    beside the technical challenges in realizing bond dilution ( and bond disorder in general ) in real antiferromagnets ,",
