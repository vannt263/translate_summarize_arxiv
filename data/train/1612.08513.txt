    "m - theory was conjectured in the mid 90s as a hidden theory : it would play a crucial pivotal role in a possible non - perturbative formulation unifying five perturbative string theories which had been established in the mid 80s .",
    "the basic tenets of m - theory are as follows :    1 .   it achieaves a complete unification of strings and d - branes in a compactified @xmath0 dimensional spacetimes .",
    "2 .   there is a unique fundamental length scale @xmath1 corresponding to the 11 dimensional planck scale .",
    "together with the radius @xmath2 of compactification of ( 10,1)-dimensional spacetime to @xmath3 dimensional spacetimes corresponding to type iia string theory ( and @xmath4 heterotic string theory ) , it sets the string scale @xmath5 and string coupling constant @xmath6 as @xmath7 the scales and couplings of the other perturbative string theories are related by duality relations .",
    "for instance , the so - called s - duality of type iib theory is explained by introducing additional compactification along one of remaining spatial directions with radius @xmath8 : the type iia and iib theories are then related by a t - duality transformation , @xmath9 thus the s - duality transformation @xmath10 of type iib theory corresponds simply to the interchange of 10th and 11th directions , @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   the underlying dynamical degrees of freedom are super - membranes ( or m2-banes ) which have an  electrical charge \" coupled to a 3-form gauge field as particular components of physical degrees of freedom of super - membranes .",
    "there are also excitations , called m5-branes , which correspond to excitations which are electro - magnetically dual to super - membranes .",
    "after compactification to @xmath3 dimensions , the super - membranes behave either as fundamental strings when one of their two spatial directions is wrapped along the compactified direction , or as d2-branes when none of the spatial directions of supermembranes are wrapped along the compactified direction .    in particular , as a consequence of these assumptions , gravitons in compactified 11 dimensions ,",
    "if momentum along the compactified direction is zero , are the ground - state modes of strings at least in the limit of small compactifcation radius , and if they have non - zero momentum along the compactified direction , are the kaluza - klein modes which should coincide with the ground - state of wrapped super - membrane with non - zero momentum in the same direction and are identified with d0-branes ( or d - particles ) of type iia string theory .",
    "this picture is valid for small compactification radius @xmath12 with fixed @xmath13 .",
    "the latter relation shows that , in the opposite limit of de - compactification @xmath14 with fixed @xmath1 , we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 , namely , a very singular limit of type iia string theory corresponding to _ infinite _ string tension and _ infinite _ string coupling . since string theory has been known only perturbatively in the limit of infinitely small @xmath17 , it is very difficult to imagine how such a peculiar limit should be formulated .",
    "one suggestive expectation is that m - theory might be described by some degrees of freedom corresponding to short strings and its kk modes or d0-branes but with some intrinsic non - perturbative interactions among them , which would make possible some mechanisms generating not only supermembranes , but also other physical degrees of freedom as some sort of bound states of d0-branes ( and short strings ) .",
    "a similar picture which seems to be compatible with the foregoing viewpoint naturally emerges itself if we envisage the dynamics of super - membranes . to study the relativistic dynamics of membranes assuming flat 11-dimensional spacetimes",
    ", we can start from a typical action @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the target space coordinates of the membrane and the ellipsis ( @xmath21 ) means other contributions involving in particular the fermionic degrees of freedom . throughout this lecture",
    ", we always use einstein s summation convention for spacetime ( and/or space ) indices in target space .",
    "the variable @xmath22 is an auxiliary field , transforming as a world - volume density under 3-dimensional diffeomorphism with respect to the parameterization @xmath23 of the world - volume of a membrane .",
    "we also used the following notation , @xmath24 which will be called  nambu - bracket \" ( or nambu - poisson bracket ) .",
    "the standard form ( dirac - nambu - goto type ) of the world - volume action is obtained by eliminating the auxiliary field @xmath25 .",
    "unfortunately , this is a notoriously difficult system to deal with , especially with respect to quantization .",
    "only tractable way which allow us a reasonably concrete treatment so far is to adopt the light - front gauge @xmath26 , breaking 11-dimensional lorentz covariance.@xcite after a further ( still partial ) gauge - fixing of the residual ( time - dependent ) re - parametrizations of spatial coordinates @xmath27 by demanding that the induced metric of the world - volume takes an orthogonal form @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath30 and also that light - like momentum density is a constant @xmath31 with the normalization @xmath32 , we are left with a constraint @xmath33 where @xmath34 for arbitrary pair of functions @xmath35 , and the effective hamiltonian , in the unit @xmath36 for notational brevity : @xmath37 where the indices @xmath38 of the target - space coordinates",
    "@xmath39 run over only so(9 ) transverse directions @xmath40 . the above constraint demands that the system is invariant under infinitesimal ( time - independent ) area - preserving diffeomorphism of spatial coordinates which still remains as residual gauge symmetry after all of the above gauge - fixing conditions : @xmath41 with @xmath42 is an arbitrary function of the spatial world - volume coordinates .    as a 3-dimensional field theory ,",
    "this is still a very nontrivial system without standard kinetic - potential terms , such as @xmath43 , of second order , but being instead equipped with ( non - renormalizable ) quartic interaction terms with four derivatives .",
    "a useful suggestion for controlling this system was made by goldstone and hoppe @xcite in the early 80s ( and developed further in ref .",
    "@xcite later ) .",
    "namely , we can regularize this system by replacing the fields @xmath44 by finite @xmath45 hermitian matrices @xmath46 where the matrix indices @xmath47 now run from 1 to @xmath48 .",
    "then , the above hamiltonian is replaced by @xmath49 ^ 2\\bigr)+\\cdots , \\label{memham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where and in what follows we use slanted boldface symbols @xmath50 ( hence , @xmath51 ) for matrices when the matrix indices @xmath52 are supressed .",
    "s are of course canonical - momentum matrices corresponding to the canonical - coordinate matrices @xmath54 s .",
    "the constraint corresponding to area - preserving diffeomorphism is now replaced by @xmath55 + \\cdots \\approx 0 ,   \\label{matrixconstaint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which generates infinitesimal unitary ( su(@xmath48 ) ) transformations of matrix variables : @xmath56 ,   \\quad   \\delta_f\\boldsymbol{p}_i = i[\\boldsymbol{f } , \\boldsymbol{p}_i ] \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is an arbitrary ( time - independent ) hermitian matrix .",
    "it should be clear that the matrix regularization is based on a formal but natural analogy between classical brackets @xmath58 and commutator @xmath59 $ ] .. ] the basic idea here is that given a finite world - volume with fixed topology we can alway use some appropriate fourier - like representation for the fields @xmath60 and take the resulting discretized fourier components of them as dynamical variables . if we have an appropriate way of truncating the infinite number of such fourier components into a finite set of components by keeping the remnant of the area - preserving diffeormorphism group as a symmetry group of this finite set , it would provide a desirble regularized version of the original system .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that , for sufficiently large @xmath48 , the above system would be capable of approximating arbitrary kinds of fixed topology of supermembrane in some classical limit and , in quantum theory , of describing the dynamics of supermembranes and other physical objects . now with a finite number of degrees of freedom , the system is completely well defined and therefore amenable to any non - perturbative studies including computer simulations .",
    "matrix models of this kind would play , at the very least , the role of the same sort that lattice gauge theories are playing in non - perturbative studies of gauge field theories .",
    "the importance of such tractable system in this sense should not be underestimated in view of the genuine dynamical nature of the m - theory conjecture .",
    "one of various remarkable facts concerning the matrix regularization of supermembrane is that the same system appears as the low - energy effective theory@xcite of @xmath48 d0-branes . in the same unit @xmath36 ( @xmath61 ) as above",
    ", the hamiltonian is @xmath62 ^ 2\\bigr)+\\cdots ,   \\label{d0hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the momentum is given as @xmath63 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath64 being an su(@xmath48 ) gauge matrix - field corresponding to local gauge transformation @xmath65 ,   \\label{gaugex } \\\\ & \\delta \\boldsymbol{a}=i[\\boldsymbol{f } , \\boldsymbol{a}]- \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{f}}{dt}. \\label{gaugea}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , the constraint appears as the gauss constraint corresponding to this local gauge symmetry .",
    "thus the original diffeomorphism symmetry is now interpreted as a local gauge symmetry .",
    "it should be noted that the gauge field @xmath64 does not play any dynamical role other than giving the gauss constraint , since the present system is only ( 0,1)-dimensional as a gauge field theory .",
    "the diagonal components @xmath66 of the matrices are interpreted to represent the motion of d0-branes , whereas the off - diagonal components are supposed to correspond to the lowest dynamical degrees of freedom of open strings connecting them .",
    "thus the zero - mode kinetic energy of d0-branes is @xmath67 .",
    "this coincides with if we assume @xmath68 .",
    "the latter identification is consistent with the assumption that d0-brane is a kaluza - klein mode with a unit quantized momentum along the compactified circle of radius @xmath2 : if @xmath2 is sufficiently small , then we have @xmath69 and hence @xmath70 for each independent d0-brane .",
    "this is the limit where we can trust the above effective low - energy hamiltonian for d0-branes ( of mass @xmath71 ) in weak - coupling string theory in un - compactified @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "note that if we separate out the center - of - mass momentum @xmath72 and the traceless part of the matrices @xmath73 we can write @xmath74\\bigr)+\\cdots ,   \\label{lfhamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where and in what follows we denote the traceless part of the matrices by putting @xmath75 symbol : @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 involves only the traceless part of the matrix variables .    now what should be the interpretation of the above coincidence ?",
    "suppose that we consider an ordinary relativistic system of @xmath48 interacting particles in flat spacetime .",
    "if we extract the center - of - mass momentum @xmath78 , the system would have invariably a mass - shell constraint of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the effective squared mass which describes internal ( lorentz - invariant ) dynamics of the whole system . using the light - like components , this can be expressed as @xmath81 in the limit of large @xmath82 , which corresponds to the so - called infinite momentum frame ( imf ) .",
    "alternatively , we can use an exact relation using light - like components , irrespectively of @xmath82 being large or small , @xmath83 which of course reduces to in the limit @xmath84 . in the case of",
    ", we can assume further that the compactification is made directly along the light - like direction @xmath85 with radius @xmath86 corresponding to the quantization condition @xmath87 by which coincides with if we identify @xmath77 with @xmath80 .",
    "this special compactification scheme along @xmath85 is known as the discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) in field theories .",
    "but we are now adopting this scheme to relativistic system of @xmath48 particles in configuration - space formulation , instead of relativistic local field theory where some subtleties are known with respect to its significance in non - perturbative properties of field theories .",
    "a crucial difference of this interpretation from the imf is that we can freely change the value of @xmath86 from infinitely small to infinitely large , by merely changing the lorentz frame with any _ fixed _ @xmath48 . in the imf interpretation , on the contrary",
    ", the radius @xmath2 of compactification is fixed irrespectively of which lorentz frame we are studying the system : thus for large @xmath88 we have to take large @xmath48 by assuming that each d - particle has fixed eleven - th momentum @xmath71 .",
    "r5.8 cm    actually , it is not at all obvious whether such an interacting theory of particles in configuration - space formulation assumed in this argument is completely consistent , as it stands , with lorentz invariance and principles of unitary quantum theory , within the restriction of a fixed number of particles without anti - particles .",
    "the peculiarity of the system such as is that the particles are interacting in a manifestly _ non - local _ fashion through mediating open strings , which correspond to off - diagonal matrix elements and mix them with particle coordinates through local gauge transformations .",
    "we can think of such mixing as an extension of quantum statistics of ordinary particles to d - branes .",
    "this is an entirely novel situation that we have never encountered previously , before the advent of string theory and d - brane excitations .",
    "it is not evident whether ( or to what extent ) our experiences with relativistic local field theory are applicable to this system .",
    "unfortunately , we have not acquired much improvement on true conceptual understandings on such non - locality and extended quantum statistics even after the two decades of various studies .",
    "a very bold hypothesis made in @xcite@xcite@xcite , following the so - called bfss conjecture @xcite made prior to it , is that the above su(@xmath48 ) gauge theory is already an exact theory of 11-dimensional m - theory in the special dlcq quantization scheme with finite @xmath48 .",
    "of course , in order to exhibit full 11-dimensional content of this theory under this assumption , we should be able to treat continuous values of @xmath89 in any fixed lorentz frame .",
    "thus definitely we have to take the limit @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the end .",
    "however , it is quite remarkable that even a finite-@xmath48 theory may have a definite and certain exact meaning related somehow to exact non - perturbative formulation of m - theory .",
    "it seems a pity that in spite of intensive studies made from the late 90s to the early 2000s , progress has practically stopped in the last decade . in this lecture",
    ", i would like to revisit and pursue the conjecture of the dlcq matrix theory as a working hypothesis in its strongest form .",
    "for the validity of this hypothesis , there is a presumption that @xmath77 is physically equivalent with the lorentz - invariant mass - square @xmath80 for finite @xmath48 .",
    "this must be true for arbitrary lorentz transformations , which are not restricted to boosts along the compactified ( 10th ) direction .",
    "under general lorentz transformation , the values of @xmath92 are mixed with transverse components @xmath72 of momenta .",
    "therefore they must be continuously varying even with finitely fixed @xmath48 . here",
    "it is important to recall again that within the framework of the dlcq scheme , the radius @xmath86 and hence @xmath89 are in fact regarded as continuously varying physical variables , since by boost transformations @xmath93 along the @xmath94-th spatial direction we have transformations @xmath95 or @xmath96 with arbitrary value of @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    now",
    "the final goal of this lecture is to demonstrate how it is indeed possible to formulate a fully lorentz - covariant matrix theory such that @xmath77 is physically equivalent to a lorentz invariant mass - square @xmath98 representing the internal dynamics of the system .",
    "this will be achieved by realizing a higher gauge symmetry which extends the usual su(@xmath48 ) gauge symmetry , and , such that after imposing appropriate light - like gauge conditions for the higher - gauge degrees of freedom , a manifestly lorentz covariant formulation which we are going to propose here reduces to the light - front matrix theory in the physical space of allowed states .",
    "it is obvious that , to realize such a covariant system , we need a new kind of symmetries which encompass and extend the su(@xmath48 ) gauge symmetry of the light - front formulation . in particular , it is crucial for the dlcq scheme that such higher symmetries are operational even for _ finite _ @xmath48 . in that sense ,",
    "the viewpoint that the matrix theory is just a mere regularization of supermembranes should be abandoned .",
    "in fact , the simple matrix theory explained in the previous section exhibits several notable features that indeed this theory itself has some fundamental significance , independently of its relation to supermembranes .",
    "it is to be noted , at the basis for such features , that the system can be regarded as a self - consisting universal system .",
    "this may be signified in the following serial patterns of the theories with increasingly larger gauge groups :    @xmath99 su(@xmath48 ) @xmath100 su(@xmath101)@xmath100 @xmath102 su(@xmath103 ) @xmath104 ,    and    @xmath102 su(@xmath105 ) @xmath100 su(@xmath105)@xmath106 su(@xmath107 ) + @xmath100 su(@xmath108 ) @xmath100 su(@xmath108 ) @xmath109 su(@xmath110 ) @xmath100 su(@xmath111 ) @xmath112 ,    and so on .",
    "in other words , the system can in principle describe arbitrary multi - body states of physical objects which are represented by smaller sub - systems with hermitian sub - matrices . in this way",
    ", we can represent various many - body d - brane configurations and simulate their general - relativistic interactions , as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been confirmed that 3-body nonlinear interactions of gravitons described by the classical einstein action of 11 dimensional supergrvatity emerge correctly@xcite even with finite @xmath48 through the perturbative loop effects of off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "this evidences our view that the su(@xmath48 ) matrix theory of finite @xmath48 already has some fundamental meaning beyond a possible approximate regularized formulation of supermembranes .    with this caveat in mind",
    ", we can still extract some useful hints about desirable higher symmetries from the membrane analogy at least at a formal level .",
    "the su(@xmath48 ) gauge symmetry of light - front matrix theory corresponds mathematically to the _ area_-preserving diffeomorphism on the membrane side .",
    "the area - preserving diffeomorphism can be regarded as a gauge - fixed version of a more general _ volume_-preserving diffeomorphism represented by @xmath113 which is the residual symmetry of the classical action after we adopt the condition @xmath114 , partially fixing the general 3-dimensional diffeomorphism .",
    "one arbitrary function @xmath115 of the area - preserving transformation which corresponds to one arbitrary hermitian matrix @xmath57 is now extended to two arbitrary functions @xmath116 and @xmath117 in .",
    "we call the infinitesimal transformation the nambu transformation , since nambu originated a generalization@xcite of hamiltonian dynamics by proposing dynamical systems in 3-dimensional  phase space \" @xmath118 in which the equations of motion are @xmath119 with two hamitonian - like generators @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in seeking for higher - gauge symmetries",
    ", it seems natural to try first to construct some matrix version of the nambu transformation , in analogy with the fact that the usual su(@xmath48 ) transformation is the matrix version of . as a preparation for proceeding to such a task",
    ", i will give a brief review on some salient features of nambu mechanics focusing its symmetry structure in the next part .",
    "part ii : nambu s generalized hamitonian mechanics",
    "as a motivation for his proposal of a generalized hamiltonian dynamics , nambu stressed that the liouville theorem for the hamitonian equations of motion is naturally extended to as @xmath122 expressing volume - perserving nature of general transformation .",
    "his motivation was a possible generalization of statistical mechanics such that the canonical ensemble is specified by two or more  temperatures \" corresponding to the existence of many conserved hamiltonians .",
    "the usual canonical poisson bracket is now replaced by a canonical  nambu bracket \" which has a triplet structure : @xmath123 a notable example from well - known dynamical systems which realizes this structure is the euler equations of motion of a rigid top : if we regard the 3 components @xmath124 of angular momentum in the body - fixed frame as canonical coordinates @xmath125 , @xmath126 where @xmath127 with @xmath128 s being the principal momenta of inertia of an assymmetrical top .",
    "nambu noted that the system of equations have a  gauge \" symmetry with respect to transformation @xmath129 of the pair of hamiltonians defined by @xmath130 which can be expressed equivalently as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is an arbitrary function of @xmath133 and @xmath134 as a generating function which implicitly determines the transformation .",
    "he also correctly noted that this is not the most general gauge transformation from the viewpoint of general volume - preserving transformations . in the latter viewpoint , would be slightly generalized to the transformations of the following form : @xmath135 with an arbitrary function @xmath136 of @xmath137 s , instead of the form @xmath138 .",
    "the reason for nambu s remark is originated from the fact that @xmath139 defined in is not the most general form satisfying , even if we consider arbitrary pair @xmath140 .",
    "locally , the most general form of the vector @xmath139 is @xmath141 with some vector gauge field @xmath142 , in terms of which the general gauge transformation keeping @xmath139 invariant is @xmath143 this would lead to .",
    "the form corresponds to a special form @xmath144 however , the form is not ensured in general by for an arbitrary scalar function @xmath145 .",
    ", which however requires that @xmath146 is independent of @xmath147 .",
    "this is impossible for most general choice of @xmath140 . whether this is possible",
    "thus depends on a particular system we consider .",
    "incidentally , the case of the euler equation is a typical example where this gauge choice is allowed .",
    "] the situation is in contrast to ordinary hamilton mechanics where the vector field @xmath148 with an arbitrary scalar field @xmath115 locally exhausts the area - preserving condition @xmath149 .",
    "nambu suggested that , to exhaust the most general form satisfying the latter condition in terms of triple bracket , the equations of motion may be extended to @xmath150 by introducing multiple pairs @xmath151 instead of a single pair @xmath152 .",
    "then in general there is no manifestly conserved  hamiltonians \" , somewhat contrary to nambu s original motivation for extending statistical mechanics . with this generalization",
    ", the above gauge transformation must be generalized to @xmath153 which then allows one to set @xmath154 for an arbitrary function @xmath145 .",
    "if we had started from the general form for the equations of motion from the beginning , a motivation for introducing the triple bracket and canonical structure such as would not arise , since then the role of hamiltonians would have been played directly by the vector gauge fields @xmath155 : no need to introduce pairs @xmath151 . in that sense",
    ", it was fortunate for us that nambu insisted on generalizing hamilton mechanics in his way using the triple bracket .",
    "nambu further studied canonical transformations @xmath156 of canonical coordinates which preserve . restricting to the simplest case of linear transformations , he noticed disappointedly that there is a difficulty in extending the canonical structure to higher - dimensional phase space , @xmath157 , of @xmath158-dimensions , on the basis of a naturally looking postulate that the canonical bracket obeys @xmath159 in a naive analogy with the hamilton mechanics .",
    "the problem is that the equations can not preserve this canonical structure whenever the time development mixes different triplets with different @xmath160 s .",
    "this implies that from the viewpoint of canonical structure it is not possible to extend the nambu mechanics to coupled many - body systems , in spite of several subsequent attempts toward such directions .    on the other hand",
    ", it is easy to generalize this system to an @xmath48-dimensional phase space @xmath161 such that the time evolution is described by a set of @xmath162 hamitonians @xmath163 : @xmath164 obviously , this preserves the @xmath48-dimensional volume as a straightforward extension of the case @xmath165 . with respect to symmetries ,",
    "these extended systems inherit the same problems as in @xmath165 with respect to possible extensions to @xmath166-dimensional phase space . in the present lecture ,",
    "we restrict ourselves only to the case @xmath165 and @xmath167 .",
    "one of nambu s further concerns was to examine whether or not the above structure could be extended to quantum theory . for that purpose",
    ", he considered the problem how the triple bracket defined by jacobian determinant in classical theory can be mapped to some algebraic structure denoted by @xmath168 $ ] , which is required to preserve the basic properties of the classical bracket , namely ,    1 .",
    "skew symmetry : @xmath169=-[b , a , c]=[b , c , a]=\\cdots ,   \\label{skew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 2 .",

    "so he discussed various possibilities of algebraic structures for the set of operators @xmath172 , including possible generalizations as , by studying slightly weakened versions of these conditions .",
    "unfortunately , however , the main conclusion was that it was difficult to realize quantization nontrivially .",
    "nambu then studied the possibilities of using non - associative algebras , but his conclusion was again not definitive .",
    "further developments of nambu mechanics rested largely upon a seminal work by takhtajan@xcite which appeared after two decades since nambu s original proposal . in this work ,",
    "it was pointed out that there exists an important identity ( now known as the  fundamental identity \" , fi ) satisfied by the nambu bracket , which generalizes the jacobi identity in the case of poisson bracket . for an arbitrary set of five functions @xmath173",
    ", it takes the form @xmath174 this ensures that the canonical structure is preserved by the time evolution described by , as can be seen by applying this identity with @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the same can be said for general infinitesimal canonical transformation defined by @xmath177 with a pair @xmath178 of arbitrary functions of the canonical coordinates .",
    "this clarifies the reason why it is difficult to generalize the system to interacting many - body cases .",
    "for instance , the postulate does not in fact satisfy the fi .",
    "this is in marked contrast to ordinary hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "also , the triple commutator does not in general satisfy the fi .",
    "this partially explains the difficulties encountered in quantization .",
    "these features indicate that the nambu mechanics is a quite restricted dynamical system which is characterized by the stringent structure of the fi . in other words",
    ", we can not expect the same kind of universality for nambu mechanics as we have in the framework of hamilton mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , we may also take a viewpoint , which is complementary to the foregoing statement , that nambu mechanics provides a new structure characterized by higher - symmetry transformations with two arbitrary functions as parameters of transformation , instead of corresponding transformation with one arbitrary function in hamilton mechanics .",
    "our standpoint in applying and extending the nambu transformation starting from is this interpretation of nambu mechanics . instead of developing further the nambu mechanics as a dynamical system ,",
    "we extract only new symmetry structure as a clue toward higher symmetries which we need for constructing a covariant version of matrix theory .",
    "it is possible to imagine dynamical systems which obey the usual hamiltonian mechanics with respect to its time evolution , but equipped with higher symmetries characterized by some appropriate ( quantized or discretized ) version of which enables us to encompass the usual su(@xmath48 ) transformation and as a special ( gauge - fixed ) case .",
    "this is precisely what we are going to try in the third part of the present lecture .",
    "before proceeding to exploration toward such a direction , i would like to make further comments on the nature of nambu mechanics .",
    "one important remark made in @xcite is that we can always regard the nambu mechanics as a special case of hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "namely , given the structure satisfying the fi , we can always define poisson brackets which are subordinated to nambu bracket , by @xmath179 where @xmath180 is arbitrary but fixed once and for all .",
    "it is easy to see that by setting @xmath181 , the fi reduces to the jacobi identity for this poisson bracket @xmath182 and the nambu equations of motion now take the form , @xmath183 with a single hamiltonian @xmath133 .",
    "another hamiltonian @xmath180 now characterizes the structure of phase space through the poisson bracket .",
    "this fact strengthens our view that the usual hamilton mechanics is far more universal as a scheme for representing dynamics , and nambu mechanics should be regarded as a special case of it characterized by higher symmetries , rather than as a new universal framework for representing dynamics .",
    "in fact the euler equations can also be formulated in terms of the standard poisson brackets of the angular momenta of the body - fixed frame which are in fact nothing but this representation : namely we have @xmath184    thus it is not unreasonable to take the standpoint , for arbitrary nambu system of equations of motion , that quantization as a means to develop a new dynamical approach should be done by elevating the subordinated poisson brackets to commutators in an appropriate hilbert space which provides a representation of the commutator algebra corresponding to a chosen subordinate poisson bracket .",
    "this may not be along nambu s original intension , but certainly is a possible and consistent attitude . in view of the presence of gauge symmetry which is intrinsic to the nambu system , one of main issues from this viewpoint",
    "would then be whether or not this provides physically unique result for different but gauge - equivalent choices of @xmath140 , rather than trying to quantize nambu brackets directly .",

    "although this might look as a deficiency from the viewpoint of constructing a universal framework of nambu mechanics , our standpoint is different as we have already discussed emphatically in part ii . from the viewpoint of symmetry",
    ", this deficiency rather turns to a merit in that it means stronger constraints in constructing theory than the case with automatic presence of derivation property .    in @xcite ,",
    "we have also proposed alternative directions in which the matrices are replaced by  cubic matrices \" @xmath191 with three indices .",

    "our standpoint would coincide with my previous remark on the direct use of vector gauge field @xmath155 in section 5 , concerning the meaning of the general form in nambu mechanics .",
    "even if so , however , the bracket notation will still be very useful and convenient in expressing invariants succinctly .",

    "let us consider the meaning of the violation of scaling symmetry , which is required in order to relate our system with light - front matrix theory .",
    "namely , the 11 dimensional planck length emerges by specifying the value of @xmath229 as an initial condition .",
    "this determines the coupling constant for the internal dynamics of the system .",
    "a natural interpretation of this situation seems that @xmath229 defines a super - selection rule with respect to scaling transformations .",
    "namely , once its value is fixed by initial condition , no superposition is allowed among different values of @xmath229 .",
    "the scale symmetry means that any two systems with different values of @xmath229 are mapped into each other with a simple rescaling of dynamical variables .",
    "thus all the different super - selection sectors actually describe essentially the same physics , apart from global scaling transformations .",
    "the initial condition just selects one of the continuously distributed super - selection sectors . in this sense , scale symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "on the other hand , scale symmetry signifies an important fact that our theory has one and only one fundamental length scale @xmath1 through spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it should be noted also that , even though states are not superposed between different values of invariant @xmath229 , states with different lorentz components of @xmath298 must be allowed to be superposed . that this is the case is seen , for instance , from the constraint , which in the light - like coordinates of the m - plane takes the form ,",
    "@xmath348 this implies that different states with different ",
    "energies\"@xmath349 or @xmath350 , in general , have different values @xmath351 or @xmath352 , respectively .",
    "the states with different energies are certainly superposed in quantum dynamics , and hence also states with different values of these components of the m - variable with fixed @xmath229 are in general superposed .",
    "incidentally , these relations show that the light - like limit @xmath353 corresponds to a singular limit @xmath354 or @xmath355 .",
    "now let us come to our last subject of this lecture .",
    "the question we have to ask is now whether and how our covariantized matrix theory can have supersymmetry , which is also one of indispensable elements ensuring the compatibility of this system with eleven - dimensional gravity .",
    "one of obstacles in formulating supersymmetry in a covariant fashion is that we have to reduce the number of degrees of freedom associated with the fermion variables in 11 dimensions : a single majonara fermion has 32 ( real ) components .",
    "if we suppose that supersymmetry is realized without spontaneous symmetry breaking , the number of physical degrees of freedom must match between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the bosonic coordinate degrees of freedom is @xmath356 for each real components of matrices in our system : @xmath357 corresponds to higher gauge symmetry and @xmath358 to the ordinary su(@xmath48 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "thus , 32 of the majorana fermion must be reduced to @xmath359 . in the classical theory of supermembrane ,",
    "this reduction is made due to the presence of a fermionic gauge symmetry , the so - called @xmath360-symmetry .",
    "it is also the case of manifestly covariant formulations of superstrings in 10 dimensions . using this @xmath360-symmetry",
    ", we can put a gauge condition on fermions , achieving the required reduction . in the same vein",
    ", we may try to find some extension of @xmath360-like fermionic gauge symmetry in our system .",
    "however , for our purpose it is sufficient if we have some way of imposing condition of reduction directly without violating lorentz covariance . in that case , the existence of such fermionic gauge symmetry is not a necessary prerequisite for a covariant formulation of supersymmetry . in this lecture ,",
    "we take this standpoint .",
    "of course , this does _ not _ mean that the fermionic gauge symmetry is impossible : at least from esthetic viewpoint , such a symmetry would be still desirable , though from a practical viewpoint it may neither be necessary nor useful .",
    "one of the reasons for our standpoint is that in the case of fermionic variables , it is impossible to separate them into the coordinate and momentum variables in a covariant fashion , since they are inextricably mixed under lorentz transformations , corresponding to their first - order nature of the dynamics of fermions .",
    "this feature necessarily leads to second - class constraints in the canonical formalism , and compels us to assign the same transformation law for all spinor components on an equal footing , which can be satisfied only for the usual su(@xmath48 ) gauge transformation .",
    "we denote the fermionic majonara variable by @xmath361 and @xmath362 : the former is the fermionic partner to the center - of - mass bosonic variables @xmath363 .",
    "the latter is a _",
    "hermitian matrix whose real components are majorana fermions separately . for notational brevity",
    ", we suppress the @xmath364 symbol for the fermion traceless matrix .",
    "one basic assumption corresponding to our standpoint explained above is that there is no fermionic counterpart for the bosonic m - variables @xmath365 .",
    "this implies that the fermionic variables do not subject to higher - gauge transformations : @xmath366)=(0,\\delta_h \\boldsymbol{\\theta } ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\delta_h\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=i[\\boldsymbol{h},\\boldsymbol{\\theta}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , as for the invariants involving only fermionic variables , we can adopt usual trace of product of matrices . for expressing invariants involving both fermionic and bosonic variables ,",
    "3-bracket notation is still necessary and useful .",
    "we first treat the center - of - mass part , which can be regarded as if it is a single _ massive _ relativistic particle .",
    "it is then natural to define its action just by adopting the standard formulation of a single relativistic superparticle,@xcite as @xmath367 which is obtained from the bosonic poincar invariant by a replacement , @xmath368 corresponding to this origin of the fermionic action , the center - of - mass system is supersymmetric under @xmath369 satisfying @xmath370 with a constant @xmath371 .",
    "@xmath372 s are 11 dimensional dirac matrices in the majorana representation .",
    "this transformation is not a linear transformation : it is characterized by the shift - type transformation of @xmath361 , signifying that @xmath361 is super - coordinate accompanying the bosonic coordinates @xmath311 .",
    "the bosonic m - variables and all traceless matrix variables are inert under this supersymmetry .",
    "note that the scaling transformation for the fermionic variables are @xmath373 , and also that the @xmath282 symmetry of the bosonic part is not spoiled : it is still valid with the covariant derivative @xmath374 and the conservation law of @xmath298 .",
    "thus the gauss law is intact , being invariant under the above supersymmetry transformation .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath361 is @xmath375 which for generic time - like @xmath296 leads to the conservation law @xmath376 thus the on - shell equations of motion for bosonic center - of - mass coordinates are not modified .",
    "the generic quantum states consist of fundamental massive super - multiplet of dimensions @xmath377 . in the special limit of light - like center - of - mass satisfying @xmath378",
    ", it is well known that this system has a local fermionic symmetry called siegel symmetry which is the origin of more general @xmath360-symmetry of string and membrane theories .",
    "@xmath379 where @xmath380 is an arbitrary majorana spinor function .",
    "this allows one to eliminate a half of components of @xmath361 adjoined with a suitable redefinition of @xmath311 .",
    "thus , a massless graviton multiplet consists of @xmath381 states .",
    "but in the present case , we are in general dealing with many - body states of such gravitons which obeys the massive representations , where @xmath382 .",
    "now we turn to traceless matrix part , describing the internal dynamics of the system . unlike the center - of - mass case",
    ", supersymmetry transformations of traceless matrices are expected to start from a linear form without shift - type contributions , but with possible nonlinear corrections of higher orders . as for the bosonic coordinates",
    ", we start from @xmath383 where we have different symbol @xmath384 for the fermionic parameter of transformation , in order to keep in mind that this transformation is independent of the previous one for the center - of - mass system .",
    "we call this supersymmetry dynamical supersymmetry . for this type of transformations",
    "to be successfully formulated , as we have discussed in the beginning of this section , we have to impose some constraints , thereby which the degrees of freedom match between bosonic and fermionic sides .",
    "this necessarily comes about by requiring that supersymmetry transformation should keep the bosonic gauss constraints consistently .",
    "if we assume naturally that @xmath296 and @xmath298 are inert under dynamical super transformation , the constraints , and , require @xmath385 respectively .",
    "there is a natural projection condition suitable for our demand , due to the existence of the m - plane in the bosonic sector .",
    "we define ( real ) projection operators @xmath386 where @xmath387 are conserved and lorentz invariant , satisfying @xmath388 where @xmath389 denotes so(9 ) directions in any ( orthogonal ) basis , being transverse to the m - plane . for the validity of these relations , it is crucial to use the orthogonality of two conserved vectors @xmath296 and @xmath298 , namely the gauss constraint associated with @xmath282-gauge transformations .",
    "thus it should be kept in mind that the dynamical supersymmetry is satisfied in each sector with definite values of these conserved and mutually orthogonal vectors .",
    "the last relation shows that we can clearly separate the directions between those ( called  longitudinal \" ) along the m - plane and those ( called  transversal \" ) orthogonal to the m - plane .",
    "this is precisely what we need in order to meet our requirements .",
    "we introduce the projection conditions as @xmath390 together with the opposite projection on @xmath384 , @xmath391 this eliminates a half of 32 majorana components , as required . using the postulate",

    "thus as expected , the dynamical supersymmetry is effective only for the spacetime directions which are transverse to the m - plane .",
    "this is natural , since as we have seen clearly in the previous section that internal dynamics is associated entirely to the transverse variables .",
    "in fact , if we adopt the light - like lorentz frame which we have introduced in discussing gauge fixing in the previous section , the projection condition is equivalent to the ordinary light - cone condition for fermionic matrices : we can rewrite by multiplying @xmath395 on both sides , as @xmath396 which reduces to @xmath397 we will give full transformation laws for dynamical supersymmetry , after showing the total supersymmetric action involving both bosonic and fermionic variables in the next section .",

    "this is not straightforward , due to the intrinsic non - locality and novel higher gauge symmetries of the present model .",
    "perhaps resolution of this problem would require full quantum mechanical treatments , remembering that interactions of subsystems , such as gravitons , are loop effects of off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "covariant re - formulation of the matrix string theory : + there is a closedly related cousin to matrix theory : the so - called matrix string theory.@xcite the latter can be regarded as a natural matrix regularization@xcite of supermembrane theory when the membranes are wrapped along the compactified circle . it may be possible to extend the present formulation to this case too . if successfully done , it may provide us a new method of dealing with second - quantized strings in a manifestly covariant fashion in ( 9,1 ) dimensions .",
    "anti d0-branes : + this is one of the most pressing but difficult issues remaining . to include anti d0-branes , the su(@xmath48 ) gauge symmetry must be extended to the product of at least two independent gauge structure with su(@xmath48)@xmath109 su(@xmath430 ) .",
    "furthermore , corresponding to the pair creation and annihilation of d0-anti d0 pairs , it should be possible to describe dynamically processes with varying @xmath48 and @xmath430 but keeping @xmath431 conserved .",
    "in other words , such a theory should be formulated in a fock space@xcite with respect to the sizes of matrices .",
    "this is a very difficult issue , to which appropriate attention has not been paid yet .",
    "+ related to this problem is that the dynamical supersymmetry is expected in general to be spontaneously broken when d0 and anti d0 coexist.@xcite@xcite then , we should expect that even the dynamical supersymmetry would be realized in an intrinsically non - linear fashion . from this point of view",
    ", the present formulation of supersymmetry must be regarded as still tentative .",
    "it might be necessary to extend the bosonic higher gauge symmetry to include higher fermionic gauge symmetry , which may be a counterpart of the @xmath360-symmetry of classical supermembranes , such that our projection condition for fermionic variables is regarded as a gauge - fixing condition for such higher fermionic gauge symmetry .",

    "<S> this lecture consists of three parts . in part </S>",
    "<S> i , an overview is given on the so - called matrix theory in the light - front gauge as a proposal for a concrete and non - perturbative formulation of m - theory . </S>",
    "<S> i emphasize motivations towards its covariant formulation . </S>",
    "<S> then , in part ii , i turn the subject to the so - called nambu bracket and nambu mechanics , which were proposed by nambu in 1973 as a possible extension of the ordinary hamiltonian mechanics . after reviewing briefly nambu s original work , </S>",
    "<S> it will be explained why his idea may be useful in exploring higher symmetries which would be required for covariant formulations of matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> then , using this opportunity , some comments on the nature of nambu mechanics and its quantization are given incidentally : though they are not particularly relevant for our specialized purpose of constructing covariant matrix theory , they may be of some interests for further developments in view of possible other applications of nambu mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the details will be relegated to forthcoming publications . in part </S>",
    "<S> iii , i give an expository account of the basic ideas and main results from my recent attempt to construct a covariantized matrix theory on the basis of a simple matrix version of nambu bracket equipped with some auxiliary variables , which characterize the scale of m - theory and simultaneously play a crucial role in realizing ( dynamical ) supersymmetry in a covariant fashion .    </S>",
