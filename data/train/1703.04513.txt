    "we propose to monitor the night sky of the southern hemisphere with a second generation of the extreme universe space observatory ( euso ) , to be flown aboard a super - pressure balloon ( sbp ) .",
    "this mission , euso - spb2 , has several exploratory and scientific objectives .",
    "euso - spb2 will be the first instrument to measure air - showers by viewing their cherenkov light from high in the atmosphere .",
    "we expect to observe a rather large sample of cosmic rays in the energy range @xmath0 , and will potentially be able to discriminate among primary protons , heavy nuclei , and photons via their characteristic cherenkov profiles  @xcite",
    ". the instrument will also be able to characterize the background for upward going showers initiated by the decay of tau leptons which are expected to be produced by earth - skimming tau neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "in addition to detection of cherenkov light , we plan to use fluorescence light to measure , for the first time , the evolution of nearly horizontal extensive air showers , which develop at high altitude in a nearly constant density atmosphere .",
    "such measurements will provide a unique channel to tune hadronic interaction models at ultrahigh energies , and may elucidate the reason why ultrahigh - energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) showers observed by ground - based detectors contain more muons than expected from existing hadronic interaction models  @xcite .",
    "importantly , euso - spb2 will serve as a pathfinder for the more ambitious space - based measurements by the probe of extreme multi - messenger astrophysics ( poemma ) , currently under study by nasa .",
    "poemma will combine the well - developed orbiting wide - field light - collectors ( owl ) concept  @xcite with the recently proposed cherenkov from astrophysical neutrinos telescope ( chant ) concept  @xcite to form a multi - messenger probe of the most extreme environments in the universe .",
    "euso - spb2 will build upon the experience of flying euso - spb in the spring of 2017 .",
    "a number of upgrades will render euso - spb2 more powerful , including a schmidt design reflecting telescope and a faster ultraviolet ( uv ) camera to increase exposure to uhecr observations .",
    "the new instrument will detect the fluorescence signal from uhecr generated air - showers of highly inclined events .",
    "euso - spb2 will be built to view the true horizon of the earth .",
    "horizontal observations will lead to much larger acceptances for inclined uhecrs , with a distance - dependent energy threshold .",
    "we are also prepared to consider additional nadir observations of the fluorescence based on euso - spb results .",
    "the combination of nadir ( euso - spb ) and tilted ( euso - spb2 ) observations will explore the power of space observatories to observe uhecr of extreme energies .",
    "a long enough flight of euso - spb2 observations will match and complement ground observations  @xcite .",
    "in addition to improving the exposure to uhecrs , euso - spb2 will study the possibility of detecting tau neutrinos via direct cherenkov light  @xcite .",
    "a coincidence veto will be developed for euso - spb2 so it can characterize the background for cherenkov signals from the decay of tau leptons , produced in charged current interactions of earth skimming neutrinos .",
    "euso - spb2 will inform the best strategy for future space missions such as poemma .",
    "the detectors aboard euso - spb2 will measure the cherenkov signals from nearly horizontal air - showers initiated by high - energy cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the instrument will use the technique of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) , which is widely used in contemporary gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "we expect a large statistical sample which will allow for study of spectral features and composition in an interesting energy regime . since good distinguishing power between baryon and photon induced showers has been shown to be feasible for an iact  @xcite we can theoretically reach a competitive photon sensitivity with a similar airborne instrument .",
    "euso - spb2 addresses the fourth science goal of the 2011 nasa strategic plan  @xcite , to `` discover how the universe works , explore how it began and evolved '' and one of the `` physics of the cosmos '' questions in nasa s 2010 science plan  @xcite : `` how do matter , energy , space , and time behave under the extraordinarily diverse conditions of the cosmos ? ''",
    "euso - spb2 directly addresses the sixth question in the connecting quarks with the cosmos report  @xcite in this report s list of `` eleven science questions for the new century , '' which is `` how do cosmic accelerators work and what are they accelerating ?",
    "'' upcoming measurements of euso - spb2 are essential to achieve the ambitious recommendations of the u.s .",
    "hep snowmass planning process : `` the bright side of the cosmic frontier : cosmic probes of fundamental physics ''  @xcite .",
    "the origin(s ) of cosmic rays remains a challenging enigma of particle astrophysics .",
    "the energy spectrum spans about eleven decades of energy , @xmath1 .",
    "the spectral shape can be described by a broken power law with three major breaks : the steepening of the spectrum dubbed the `` knee '' at @xmath2  @xcite , a pronounced hardening of the spectrum at @xmath3 , the so - called `` ankle '' feature  @xcite , and the uv cutoff at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "three additional more subtle features have been reported over the years in between the knee and the ankle : a hardening of the spectrum at @xmath5  @xcite followed by two softenings at @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the latter softening is usually referred to as the `` second knee . ''",
    "the variations of the spectral index in the energy spectrum reflect various aspects of cosmic ray production , source distribution , and propagation .",
    "there exists evidence that convinces us that the first and second knee could reflect the maximum energy of galactic magnetic confinement or acceleration capability of the sources , both of which grow linearly in the charge @xmath8 of the nucleus . in this scenario ,",
    "the first knee represents the energy range at which protons escape the galaxy and the second knee indicates where the highest-@xmath8 cosmic rays escape .",
    "the knee has been extensively studied by a number of experiments and its characteristics are by now well understood as magnetic rigidity effects for different nuclear composition  @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of the second - knee , however , is less well established and the energy at which the galactic extragalactic transition takes place is a matter of debate .    from existing iact data , we can estimate the euso - sbp2 sensitivity to high - energy cosmic ray events . if we assume a trigger threshold of 100 photoelectrons with 100 days of data collection , we find that euso - spb2 will reach a sensitivity for an energy - squared weighted flux of @xmath9 , in the energy range @xmath10 .",
    "the average cosmic ray flux in this decade of energy is @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this means that about @xmath12 cosmic ray events will be detected during the mission .",
    "measurement of the eletron and muon component of the shower will be possible via a sophisticated statistical analysis of the full data sample .",
    "such information will be invaluable for understanding the nuclear composition , and may provide the best current opportunity to clarify the origin of the second - knee ( we expect around 100 events with @xmath13 ) .",
    "observation in this energy regime will also contribute to understanding of other subtle features reported in the spectrum .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the ankle is that above @xmath14 a new population emerges which dominates the more steeply falling galactic population of heavy nuclei .",
    "the extragalactic component can be dominated either by protons  @xcite or heavies  @xcite , with the uv cutoff dominated by photopion production and photodisintegration , respectively .",
    "this is the mechanism behind the well - known _ greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin _ ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite .",
    "it has also been advocated that the ankle feature could be well reproduced by a proton - dominated power - law spectrum , where the ankle is formed as a _ dip _ in the spectrum from the energy loss of protons via bethe - heitler pair production  @xcite . in this case",
    "extragalactic protons would already have started to dominate the spectrum somewhat beyond @xmath15 .",
    "optical observations of air showers with fluorescence telescopes or non - imaging cherenkov detectors consistently find a predominantly light composition at around @xmath16  @xcite and the contribution of protons to the overall cosmic ray flux is @xmath17  50% in this energy range  @xcite . due the absence of a large anisotropy in the arrival direction of cosmic rays below the ankle  @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that these protons must be of extragalactic origin . at energies above @xmath18 ,",
    "the high - statistics data from the pierre auger observatory suggests a gradual increase of the fraction of heavy nuclei in the cosmic ray flux  @xcite . within uncertainties ,",
    "the data from the telescope array ( ta ) are consistent with these findings  @xcite .",
    "in addition , ta has observed a statistically significant excess in cosmic rays with energies above @xmath19 in a region of the sky spanning about @xmath20 , centered on equatorial coordinates ( r.a .",
    "= @xmath21 , dec .",
    "= @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "this is colloquially refer to as the ta hot spot .",
    "the absence of a concentration of nearby sources in this region of the sky corroborates other experimental evidence for heavy nuclei , whereby a few local sources within the gzk sphere can produce the hot spot through deflection in the galactic @xmath23-field .",
    "all in all , the apparent dominance of heavy nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath18 is in contradiction with the interpretations of the ankle given above .",
    "it is possible to accommodate the data with the addition of an _ ad hoc _ light extragalactic component below the ankle , with a steep injection spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , a more natural explanation of the entire spectrum and composition emerges while accounting for the `` post - processing '' of uhecrs through photodisintegration in the environment surrounding the source  @xcite . in such models",
    "relativistic nuclei accelerated by a central engine to extremely high energies remain trapped in the turbulent magnetic field of the source environment .",
    "their escape time decreases faster than the interaction time with increasing energy , so that only the highest energy nuclei can escape the source unscathed . in effect",
    ", the source environment acts as a high - pass filter on the spectrum of cosmic rays .",
    "all nuclei below the energy filter interact , scattering off the far - infrared photons in the source environment .",
    "these photonuclear interactions produce a steep spectrum of secondary nucleons , which is overtaken by the harder spectrum of the surviving nucleus fragments above about @xmath24 .",
    "these overlapping spectra could then carve an ankle - like feature into the source emission spectrum .",
    "the spectrum above the ankle exhibits a progressive transition to heavy nuclei , as the escape of non - interacting nuclei becomes efficient . reproducing the data with such a model requires a hard injection spectrum @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , simultaneously reproducing just the component of the spectrum above the ankle together with the observed nuclear composition also requires a hard source spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a plethora of source candidates have been poposed , among the most popular being active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , starburst galaxies , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite .",
    "agns are actively - accreting super - massive black holes and are sometimes associated with jets terminating in lobes , which can be detected in radio .",
    "the so - called `` radiogalaxies '' are a sub - class of agns , which contain localized regions of intense synchrotron emission known as hot spots .",
    "these regions are presumably produced when the bulk kinetic energy of the jets ejected by a central agn is reconverted into uhecrs  @xcite .",
    "uhecr acceleration is also possible in polar cap regions of the black hole magnetosphere  @xcite .",
    "centaurus a ( cen a ) is the closest radiogalaxy to earth and has long been suspected to be a potential uhecr accelerator  @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration has searched for anisotropies in the direction of cen a scanning the energy threshold between @xmath26 and @xmath27 and counting events in angular radii ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29  @xcite . the strongest departure from isotropy (",
    "post - trial probability @xmath30 ) has been observed for @xmath31 in a window of @xmath32 , see fig.[fig:1 ] ; 14 events ( out of a total of 155 ) have been observed in such an angular window while 4.5 are expected on average from isotropic distributions .",
    "starbursts are galaxies undergoing a large - scale star formation episode .",
    "their characteristic signatures are strong infrared emission ( originating in the high levels of interstellar extinction ) , a very strong hii - region - type emission - line spectrum ( due to a large number of o and b - type stars ) , and a considerable radio emission produced by recent supernova remnants .",
    "uhecr could be efficiently accelerated at the terminal shock of a galactic - scale superwind , which is driven by the collective effect of supernovae and massive star winds  @xcite .",
    "because of the high prevalence of supernovae , starbursts should posses a large density of newly - born pulsars . due to their important rotational and magnetic energy reservoirs",
    "these young neutron stars have been explored as a potential engine for uhecr acceleration  @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite demonstrates that for the most reasonable range of neutron star surface temperatures ( @xmath33 ) , a large fraction of heavy nuclei survive photo - disintegration losses in the hostile environment sustained by the thermal radiation field from the star .",
    "the spectrum of accelerated uhecrs is determined by the evolution of the rotational frequency : as the star spins down , the energy of the cosmic ray particles ejected decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "the total fluence of uhecrs accelerated in the neutron star magnetosphere is very hard , typically @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the arrival directions of the highetst energy cosmic rays recorded by the yakutsk , fly s eye , and agasa experiments can be traced back to the two nearest starbursts : m82 and ngc 253  @xcite .",
    "the possible association of the ta hot spot with m82 has not gone unnoticed  @xcite , and the possible association of auger events with ngc 253 and ngc 4945 did not escape attention either  @xcite .",
    "an apparent partnership between uhecrs and starbursts is visible in   fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "grbs are short - lived , luminous explosions at cosmological distances , thought to originate from relativistic plasma launched at the deaths of massive stars .",
    "the widely accepted interpretation of grb phenomenology is that the observable effects are due to the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding fireball  @xcite .",
    "the physical conditions in the dissipation region imply that cosmic rays can be accelerated to energies @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "uhecr acceleration at grb internal shocks may also yield a hard source spectrum  @xcite and consequently accommodate cosmic ray observations  @xcite .    even if cosmic rays include a significant component of heavy nuclei we still expect to observe an anisotropy associated with the heavy component at the highest energies , due to the anisotropic distribution of matter within the gzk sphere  @xcite . in the event that a correlation with astrophysical sources is present in the data it is important to predefine a search prescription in order to assign a meaningful _ a priori _ statistical significance to a potential observation .",
    "we follow the approach taken by the auger collaboration , in which we assume an `` interesting '' anisotropy result requires a pre - specified chance probability  @xcite . given the exploratory nature of the spb missions we will consider a 1% significance to constitute such an interesting result . for our prescription , we adopt an energy cutoff of @xmath35 , which is in the range where ta observes the hot spot .",
    "we chose our candidate objects subject to the following considerations : even though we do not know the exact declination observable during the flight the majority of candidate objects will be in the southern sky . on the basis of auger and ta data we assume euso - spb2 will not observe small - scale clustering of events , rather we chose to search for excesses in @xmath20 regions of the sky centered at the source targets .",
    "in order to be consistent with _",
    "fermi_-lat data  @xcite we adopt the hypothesis put forward in  @xcite , which postulates a local `` fog '' of uhecrs accelerated in nearby sources . in particular , we partition the probability budget equally between starbursts and radiogalaxies . more specifically , we consider the nearby radiogalaxy cen a with a 0.5% budget and starbursts ngc 253 , ngc 4945 , m83 , ngc 1068 ( assuming the latter is within the balloon exposure ) the remaining 0.5% .",
    "if ngc 1068 is not in the field of view we retain the partition of the probability budget equally between starbursts and radiogalaxies . including grbs in the prescription",
    "would introduce a considerable complexity in the analysis due to their transit nature .",
    "note that this prescription has been designed in time for the launch of the first euso - spb in late march 2017 , implying that we can also use data gathered in this flight in our search .      when the incident cosmic radiation interacts with atomic nuclei of air molecules , it produces fluxes of secondary , tertiary , and subsequent generations of particles .",
    "all these particles together create a cascade , called air shower . as the cascade develops longitudinally the particles become less and less energetic since the energy of the incoming cosmic ray is redistributed among more and more participants . the transverse momenta acquired by the secondaries",
    "cause the particles to spread laterally as they propagate through the atmospheric target .",
    "most of the air shower particles excite nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere , which fluoresce in the uv .",
    "fast uv cameras aboard euso - esp2 will record the fluorescence light produced by the particle cascades .",
    "if the primary cosmic ray is a baryon , hundreds to thousands of secondary particles are usually produced at the interaction vertex , many of which have energies above the highest accelerator energies  @xcite .",
    "these secondary products are hadrons , mostly pions with a small admixture of kaons and nucleons .",
    "when the @xmath36 s ( with a lifetime of @xmath37 ) do decay promptly to two photons , they feed the electromagnetic component of the shower .",
    "charged mesons because of a longer lifetime , not only decay but also interact strongly with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "the competition between the two processes depends essentially on the balance between interaction mean free path ( dependent on the cross - section and the density of the medium transversed ) and the mean decay length .",
    "both vary substantially with energy and become equal at a critical energy @xmath38 . for a vertical transversal of the atmosphere , such a critical energy is found to be @xmath39 for charged pions and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 for kaons  @xcite .",
    "hence , below the critical energies the decay probability becomes larger than the interaction probability . charged pions and kaons give rise to muons and muon - neutrinos in the shower .",
    "neutrinos escape detection carrying roughly 2% of the primary energy , while the highly relativistic muons propagate to the ground .",
    "the number of particles as a function of the amount of atmosphere penetrated by the cascade ( @xmath43 in @xmath44 ) is known as the longitudinal profile .",
    "a well - defined peak in the longitudinal development , @xmath45 , occurs where the number of @xmath46 in the electromagnetic shower is at its maximum .",
    "@xmath45 increases with primary energy , as more cascade generations are required to degrade the secondary particle energies . evaluating the mean and",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath45 distribution is a fundamental part of many of the composition analyses done when studying air showers .",
    "the generic shower properties can be qualitatively well understood using the superposition principle , which states that a shower initiated by a nucleus with @xmath47 nucleons and energy @xmath48 behaves to a good approximation as the superposition of @xmath47 proton showers with initial energy @xmath49",
    "this phenomenological assumption relies on the fact that the effect of nuclear binding is negligible compared to the extremely high energies of the incoming cosmic rays .",
    "thus , for a given total energy @xmath48 , showers initiated by a heavy nucleus have smaller @xmath50 than proton induced showers .",
    "shower - muon - richness is also sensitive to the nuclear composition  @xcite .",
    "euso - spb2 will be able to measure for the first time showers which develop nearly horizontally at high altitude , where the density of the atmosphere is low and nearly constant .",
    "for such showers , the competition between interaction and decay significantly modifies the average and spread of the @xmath45 distribution compared to the distributions characterizing more vertical showers .",
    "this results from the hadrons spending more time in the tenuous atmosphere where they are more likely to decay than interact as compared to a shower developing through an atmosphere of progressively increasing density . at present",
    ", hadronic interaction models extrapolated from lhc data can be vetted at higher energies only via air shower observables ( like the mean and spread of @xmath45 and muon richness ) for showers that impact the earth  @xcite .",
    "euso - spb2 observations of high - altitude horizontal showers will provide a complementary handle on hadronic interaction models due to the unique environment in which the particle cascades take place .      the announcement by the icecube collaboration of the observation of 53 astrophysical neutrino candidates in the energy range @xmath51 has been greeted with a great deal of justified excitement  @xcite . with these events , a purely atmospheric explanation for the neutrino flux",
    "is rejected at more than @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "icecube s discovery represents the `` first light '' in the nascent field of neutrino astronomy .",
    "a nearly guaranteed neutrino flux originates in the decay of charged pions , which are expected to be produced in @xmath53 or @xmath54 collisions near the cosmic ray acceleration sites , either in galactic or extragalactic sources  @xcite . since cosmic rays and neutrinos",
    "may originate at the same sites , searches for correlations in the arrival directions of icecube events and uhecrs have been carried out  @xcite . in particular , a possible association between the ta hot spot and icecube neutrinos has been studied  @xcite . in @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "collisions only muon and electron neutrinos are produced .",
    "if we assume the hypothesis of maximal mixing  @xcite , the flavor ratios arriving at earth should be within errors these ratios are consistent with icecube s observations  @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of tau neutrinos has remained elusive : no ( `` double - bang ''  @xcite ) events were found in three years of icecube data , in agreement with the expectation of 0.5 signal events  @xcite .",
    "euso - spb2 will search for up - going air showers produced by tau leptons originating from neutrino interactions below the earth s",
    "surface  @xcite . if no neutrino candidate is observed euso - spb2 measurements will help to establish the background for future experiments of this type , like the poemma space mission .",
    "there are three types of events which could occasionally be misinterpreted as neutrino induced up - going air showers : _",
    "( i ) _  random coincidences of excesses of the night earth background may occasionally exceed the detection threshold of the telescope camera ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "signals from high - energy cosmic ray induced showers ; _ ( iii ) _ shower - like signals produced by the direct interactions of cosmic rays with the focal plane of the detector .",
    "a detailed discussion of background events has been presented elsewhere  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the primary objective of using euso - spb2 for neutrino studies is to evaluate in detail the background with which future more ambitious space - based missions will have to contend . an optimist might also hope for detection of a few tau neutrino candidates .",
    "it is also possible to exploit cherenkov light detection to estimate the muon richness of air showers . in an air shower ,",
    "the electrons , positrons and muons all generate cherenkov light . in the case of highly inclined showers , however , muons propagate over much larger distances than the electrons and photons , resulting in cherenkov light topologies exhibiting `` halos '' or `` tails '' which are distinct from the spatiotemporal distribution of cherenkov light emerging from the quickly developing electromagnetic shower component , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this can enable searches for photon primaries in an energy regime complementary to other experiments , potentially yielding the best bounds for @xmath55 , as illustrated in fig  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "achieving such an exceptional sensitivity will , of course , require refinement of previously explored techniques to reject the cosmic ray background  @xcite .",
    "sufficient rejection power is not unprecedented in other cosmic ray experiments ; indeed the auger collaboration has reported photon bounds at the level of 0.1% of the total cosmic ray flux  @xcite .",
    "the experiment will have sensitivity to the muon component of the air showers , for primary cosmic rays in the energy range @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to test hadronic interaction models beyond colliders energies .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration has reported an excess in the number of muons of a few tens of percent over expectations computed using extrapolation of hadronic interaction models tuned to accommodate lhc data  @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted as a possible signal of new physics at sub - fermi distances  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of a new physics process is consistent with the non - observation of the muon excess at @xmath57 in data collected with the moscow state university extensive air shower ( eas - msu ) array  @xcite .",
    "however , in this same energy range , @xmath58 , a possible excess of muons has been observed with hires - mia  @xcite and kascade - grande  @xcite .",
    "therefore , corroborating evidence for the muon excess at lower energies is essential for our understanding of fundamental physics .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite euso - spb2 will have the potential to provide such evidence .",
    "a point woth noting at this juncture is that because euso - spb2 will not observe cherenkov light in stereo , it will not be feasible to measure all the physical characteristics of the shower simultaneously . with a mono system , we will be sensitive to the number of photons originating from electrons versus muons .",
    "however , reconstruction of the primary particle energy for an individual event depends not only on signal size , but also on impact parameter and the depth of the first interaction .",
    "in addition , the relation between the number of electrons and muons and the strength of the cherenkov signal in the two components depends on the impact parameter . therefore , our analysis of the muon content of showers as a function of energy can not be done on an event - by - event basis , but will require statistical analysis of our event ensemble .",
    "poemma will measure orders - of - magnitude more uhecr events than attained by ground - based observatories at @xmath59 .",
    "poemma has been designed to reach unprecedented geometrical apertures @xmath60 , which , after duty cycle corrections , correspond to annual exposures of more than @xmath61 at the highest energies .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "poemma will also be sensitive to ultrahigh - energy photons .",
    "the ultrahigh - energy photon flux is highly model dependent for astrophysical sources , being highly sensitive to the location of the closest sources  @xcite .",
    "ultrahigh - energy photons are the dominant component of models based on relic decays from the early universe , including super - heavy dark matter  @xcite . a clear detection of these photons would be momentous discovery .    in summary",

    "the test flight in 2020 will be used to verify performance of the instruments and analyze the data collected on background signal levels .",
    "the test flight payload will have the same functionality of the uldb instruments , but the focal surface will be only partially populated to minimize risks that could impact the schedule for a uldb science flight in 2022 . the data acquired during the flight will provide direct knowledge on the anticipated backgrounds during the uldb mission and allow optimizing the instrument parameters for the mission .",
    "it also prepares the team for the challenges of the spb campaign in new zealand .",
    "the uldb is well suited to address the science objectives .",

    "a well - known design form for achieving good image quality over a wide field is the schmidt telescope : a catadioptric design , consisting of both reflective and refractive optical elements .",
    "the schmidt design utilizes a spherical primary mirror with the stop at its center of curvature which eliminates coma and astigmatism , and a refractive plate placed at the stop which corrects the spherical aberration .",

    "[ fig : o1 ] , we show a spherical mirror which focuses collimated light emanating from the left .",

    "the off - axis light will suffer from coma and astigmatism in addition to the spherical aberration found in both beams .",

    "[ fig : o1 ] , by placing the stop at the center of curvature of the spherical mirror , the off - axis rays intersect the mirror in the exact same manner as the on - axis beam .",
    "thus , stop position eliminates the coma and astigmatism , but the image still suffers from spherical aberration .",
    "spherical aberration is a rotationally symmetric deviation from perfect focusing wavefront that follows a @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and higher even - powered radial polynomial form , where the higher orders appear as the aperture diameter increases .    to eliminate the spherical aberration ,",
    "a refractive plate is placed at the stop which provides the opposite wavefront deviation generated by the spherical mirror .",
    "since the deviation , at the lowest order , follows a @xmath87 form , one surface of the plate will have this form .",
    "however , for broad spectrum applications , the addition of this refracting component creates a wavelength dependent aberration . though the mirror creates the same geometrical error for all wavelengths , the refractive corrector will only perfectly correct the error for one wavelength . to reduce the image degradation from spherochromatism , a very small amount of optical power , @xmath88 ,",
    "is typically added to the corrector surface which balances some of the residual chromatic power and spherochromatism .",

    "the full fov is @xmath91 for the two cherenkov telescopes and @xmath92 for the fluorescence telescope system .",
    "these specifications lead to an equivalent focal length ( efl ) for the fluorescence imager of 0.83  m , and for the larger cherenkov imager , an entrance pupil diameter of 0.967  m , meaning that the optic is operating at f/0.86 .",
    "a baseline design was completed using zemax  @xcite .",
    "the material selected for the corrector is an uv transmitting poly methyl methacrylate ( pmma ) well known to the euso team and successfully used in several prototype systems . to achieve sufficient image quality , the design optimization varied : _ ( i ) _  the radius of the primary mirror ; _ ( ii ) _  the spacing between the primary mirror and the corrector ; _ ( iii ) _  the location of the physical stop , _",

    "this `` b - i - focal '' solution is to split the spherical mirror along a horizontal line and rotate the top and bottom halves about the vertical axis .",
    "the amount of rotation of the two spherical sections is @xmath93 , yielding a relative angular difference of @xmath94 .",
    "a preliminary tolerance analysis has been performed that indicates this system is extremely insensitive to misalignments . for each parameter",

    "refractive index errors , either isotropic , or spatially varying , must exceed any reasonably expected deviations to yield a measurable performance error .",
    "thermal soaks and gradients can impact the form of the optical elements , the refractive index of the corrector and the positions of the elements due to impacts on the structure .",
    "misalignments tend to have minimal impact on the image quality , but large misalignments in flight could shift the apparent position of the detector array which could either result in a pointing uncertainty or an aberration if the motion results in significant defocus .",

    "the framework includes parallel hierarchies for accessing data : the _ detector description _ for retrieving conditions data , including detector geometry , calibration constants and atmospheric conditions ; a plug - in mechanism in the atmosphere description allowing various techniques for computing fluorescence and cherenkov yields , both from parametric models and from measurements stored in databases ; and an _ event data model _ for reading and writing information that changes for each event .",
    "the detector description provides an interface from which module authors can retrieve the conditions data .",
    "data requests are relayed to a back - end comprising a registry of so - called _ managers _ , each of which is capable of extracting a particular sort of information from various data sources .",
    "the manager mechanism is configurable and relieves authors of the physics code from having to deal with the details of selecting and decoding the correct data source .",
    "managers are arranged in a `` chain of responsibility '' such that if an upstream manager can not answer a request , it is passed along to downstream managers for another try .",
    "the event data model contains raw , calibrated , reconstructed and monte carlo information , and serves as the backbone for communication between modules .",
    "the event is instrumented with a protocol allowing modules to discover its constituents at any point in processing , and thereby determine whether the input data required to carry out the desired processing are available . is also equipped to read formats employed by the most popular air shower simulation packages  @xcite .",

[ fig : esafstruct ] and [ fig : recostruct ] .",
    "both the and the esaf packages were designed to allow a great deal of flexibility and to easily change the detector configuration .",
    "this flexibility made it relatively straightforward to use the codes for the various euso pathfinders .",
    "both packages have been used for simulation and reconstruction of data for the euso - balloon detector  @xcite , the euso - ta  @xcite instrument as well as for simulation of the pending mini - euso and spb missions  @xcite .",
    "a euso pathfinder was flown aboard a balloon on august 2015 from the timmins stratospheric balloon facility in ontario . during this flight ,",
    "the instrument recorded data for about 5 hours .",
    "a laser and flasher were carried aboard a helicopter which flew beneath the balloon payload to test the instrument .",
    "the software was used to simulate the instrument and to reconstruct data taken during the flight .",

    "figure  [ f : balloon ] also shows the zenith angle distribution of reconstructed laser shots gathered during the campaign . as expected , the distribution peaks near @xmath101 as the laser was shot horizontally across the downward pointing telescope .",
    "similar studies were performed using the esaf package , including simulation of the euso - balloon response and detailed study of trigger performance .",
    "for instance , description of the simulation and reconstruction procedure used to predict the reconstruction performance is detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the euso - ta  @xcite pathfinder measurements were also simulated and reconstructed in a joint effort using both the and esaf packages  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the black rock mesa ta ( brm - ta ) telescopes were used to trigger a euso prototype instrument when an air shower was detected .",
    "data recorded by the brm - ta instrument were then used to reconstruct the shower distance , angle and energy .",
    "the simulation packages were then used to generate showers with the appropriate parameters to reproduce the euso - ta detected signal .",
    "the mapping of the real detector was introduced in both and esaf in order to take into account for the different efficiency of the pixels and for the dead pmts .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows a comparison of a measurement and simulation of an air - shower recorded by euso - ta on 13 may 2015  @xcite .",
    "several test sources like stars , flashers and laser shots were implemented in the packages in order to validate the detector response and check reconstruction .",
    "a simulation for the upcoming euso - spb flight has also been prepared , as well as the codes to read the data .",
    "a campaign of laser shots were reconstructed in .",

    "we re - implemented the native geant4 modules which handle fresnel reflections , total internal reflection , and reflections from ground or painted surfaces .",

    "the efficiency of the trigger has been studied in different cloud conditions , background , altitude and detector configurations  @xcite .",
    "a study of the cloud coverage and moon phase expected at the latitude and in the season where the balloon will fly has been performed  @xcite .",
    "we estimated the number of detectable particles to be between roughly 5 and 11 events depending on conditions the feasible spb flight durations .",
    "as in the euso - balloon case , we tested the energy reconstruction performance and estimated the fraction of reconstructable events .",
    "simulations for mini - euso have also been implemented in both and esaf .",
    "using esaf , we found that the energy threshold is over @xmath104  gev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore we tested the response of the detector to meteors , transient luminous events ( tles ) , lightnings , space debris and planes .",
    "the trigger scheme has been tested on slow - moving events , relevant , for instance , for meteor detection .",
    "the mini - euso trigger scheme is being tested on a wide range of events of different times scale and sizes .      developing tools for simulation and reconstruction of a variety of instruments within the same overarching software framework is challenging .",
    "fortunately , a large amount of the code developed so far can be straightforwardly recycled for use by euso - spb2 .",
    "it will ( of course ) be necessary to swap out the physics modules which simulate the optical systems and electronics , but the existing code provides an excellent opportunity to leverage a great deal of previous development effort .",
    "the adaption of both esaf and to the needs of euso - spb2 is underway .",
    "both of these packages will be employed for simulations in early phases of the euso - spb2 project in order to refine design of the final instrument .",
    "indeed , preliminary tests are now being carried out to assess the capability to detect the direct cherenkov light and the fluorescence light from distant events .",
    "again , the two packages will be used to cross - check one another .",
    "euso - spb2 observations can only be done on clear moonless nights .",
    "the balloon will fly in the southern hemisphere and thus subject to less light pollution than if it were exposed to the northern hemisphere , see fig .",
    "[ dark - night ] .",
    "a thorough study suggests that a 50 day flight launched at wanaka latitude of @xmath105 and about the expected time of euso - spb ( march / april ) would see between 190 and 260  hr of dark time , depending on when the launch happens relative to the moon phase  @xcite . for a 100  day flight",
    ", the fluctuations would smooth out a bit , and hence we estimate 500  hr would be a realistic number of dark hours , with no moon and between the end and start of astronomical twilight at 33  km .",
    "relative to a detector on ground , there is a loss of about 50  minutes per day because the horizon is further away and this loss factor is included .",
    "then , 500  hr/2400  hr yields a 20.8% duty cycle .",
    "since the spbs from wanaka go east , there is a jet lag effect that reduces the 500  hr by a few percent .",
    "we account for this correction by taking a duty cycle @xmath106 .",
    "this estimate does not take into account possible reduction of the duty cycle due to obscuration by clouds , and further assumes an operationally perfect detector . in our calculations",
    "we acount for the effect of cloud obscuration by introducing an scaling factor @xmath107 , which combines the trigger effects and reconstruction efficiency in the presence of clounds , as well as the fraction of time during which data are taken in clear and cloudy conditions ; namely , if the entire data sample were to be taken in clear sky conditions we have @xmath108 .",
    "preliminary esaf studies for euso - spb suggest that @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "since roughly 2/3 of the time the fov will be obscured by clouds , the previous @xmath107 estimate indicates that half of the events obscured by clouds can be considered of sufficient quality to have the same reconstruction and trigger efficiency as clear sky conditions .",
    "this agrees with previous studies for the jem - euso mission  @xcite . to estimate the event rate for euso - spb2 we conveniently define an effective duty cycle @xmath110 .      by comparing the red and blue lines in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] one can discern that the rate of events detected via cherenkov radiation , in the range @xmath111 , would be around @xmath12",
    ". there may be small variations in this ratio arriving from the effective duty cycle achieved by the instrument .    the final configuration for the euso - spb2 fluorescence detector will depend on the performance of euso - spb .",
    "therefore , we can not yet derive with certainty the expected rate of uhecr events .",
    "obviously , we expect euso - spb2 to perform better than euso - spb . in the following",
    "we provide a rough estimate of the number of events using the expected euso - spb performance as a guideline .",
    "we estimated the event rate of euso - spb with esaf taking into account clear and cloudy sky conditions , and the effect of cherenkov reflection from high level clouds  @xcite .",
    "as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig : esaf - cloudy ] we show the expected number of triggered events as a function of @xmath112 , for clear sky conditions . taking into account the reconstruction efficiency @xmath113 and correcting by the @xmath107 factor due to obscuration by clouds , we find that for a flight with 138  hr of dark time , we expect @xmath114 events , whereas for a flight of 211  hr of dark time , we expect @xmath115 events .",
    "the expected number of detectable uhecr events has also been estimated by monte carlo techniques using conex  @xcite to simulate shower development and to simulate the detector response .",
    "the results from these simulations for various pseudo - triggers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spb ] .",
    "a laser campaign was performed to assess the trigger threshold for euso - spb .",
    "the results of this campaign indicate that a 100% trigger efficiency requires a pseudo - trigger with 500 + photons at the euso - spb aperture per gtu , for 5 gtus .",
    "however , using the flux curve for the 500 + photons / gtu threshold alone does not fully capture how many events euso - spb might record .",
    "this is because 400 + photons / gtu corresponds to an 85% triggering efficiency , whereas 300 + photons / gtu corresponds to 22% triggering efficiency .",
    "the 200+/gtu and 100+/gtu pseudo - triggers are satisfied only by laser energies that did not trigger during the field tests .",
    "therefore , the total flux curve would be the sum of the 500 + photons / gtu curve , the portion of the 400 + curve not captured by the 500 + curve scaled by 0.85 , and the portion of the 300 + curve not captured by the 400 + curve scaled by 0.22 . a plot of the estimated total flux for euso - spb is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ total - flux ] .    the flux curves shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : spb ] and [ total - flux ] can be integrated to estimate the expected trigger rate .",
    "the results of these integrations are shown in fig .",
    "[ event - rates ] and can be summarized as follows : we expect 4.5 triggered events per 55 hours of operation , with an energy threshold at about @xmath116 and a photon threshold of 500 to 600 photons / gtu .",
    "this corresponds to a trigger event rate @xmath117 .",
    "as discussed above independent estimates of the trigger rates have been performed including the effect of clouds of varying altitude and thickness ( in esaf ) and assuming a clear sky ( in both esaf and ) .",
    "using the esaf reconstruction efficiency we can now translate the conex + trigger rate into a rate of reconstructed events , @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , using the esaf @xmath107 scaling factor we can take account of cloud obscuration , and for a 138 dark hour flight we expect a total of about 5 events to be recosntructed . note",
    "that this agrees with the estimate based soley on esaf simulation at the @xmath119 level .",
    "for euso - spb2 , it is likely the photon threshold will be superior by about a factor of 2 compared to euso - spb .",
    "the argument for this is as follows .",
    "the mirrors should deliver about twice as much light to the focal surface as the euso - spb lens system , and the spot size should cover about 2 pixels rather than 4 - 6 pixels .",
    "euso - spb has roughly a threshold of 500 photons / gtu and 40 photons from backgound , which yields 50 counts / gtu from signal and 4 counts / gtu from background , assuming 0.1 overall efficiency .",
    "doubling the throughput of the optical system would yeild 100 counts / gtu from signal but still 4 counts from background ( 2 pixels multiplied by 2 counts / pixel ) .",
    "this would imply an improvement on the trigger rate by factor of 2 . as the euso - spb2 fov could be @xmath73 ( as opposed to the @xmath120 fov for euso - spb ) ,",
    "the trigger rate will also increase by a factor of 2.5 for showers of interest . with this in mind",
    ", the number of reconstructed events in a @xmath121  day mission , which will be useful for physics analysis , is found to be @xmath122 all in all , we expect a sample size sufficient to perform interesting analysis .",
