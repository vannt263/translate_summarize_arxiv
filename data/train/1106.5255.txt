    "the multiorbital hubbard hamiltonian has been proposed  @xcite to be a suitable model for the description of a large variety of correlated electron transition metal compounds including nickelates , vanadates , and more recently iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors  @xcite .",
    "while new interesting phases like orbital - selective metal - insulator phase transitions , coexistence of paramagnetic with antiferromagnetic phases or coexistence of fermi liquid with non - fermi liquid behavior have been predicted for this model , there is still a strong debate regarding the true nature of the phase diagram .",
    "the reason for that lies in the complexity of the multiorbital model which includes orbital degrees of freedom , crystal field splitting effects as well as the hund s rule exchange coupling and also in the nature of the approaches used in order to investigate the model . in this work",
    ", we shall present a comparative investigation of the properties of the anisotropic two - orbital hubbard model within the single - site dynamical mean field approximation ( dmft )  @xcite as well as the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite where spatial fluctuations are included .",
    "we will focus on three major phenomena related to the multiorbital hubbard model .",
    "( i ) orbital selective phase transitions ( ospt ) which have been discussed , for instance , in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  @xcite and recently in iron - based superconductors  @xcite in the framework of dmft and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations . within single - site dmft",
    "it has been shown that the presence of ospt is dependent on various effects like the existence of inequivalent bandwidths at integer filling  @xcite , the presence of crystal field splitting at non - integer filling  @xcite , the absence of interorbital hybridization  @xcite as well as the appearance of different number of degenerate orbitals  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is unclear how these features are modified if spatial fluctuations are included in the calculations .",
    "for instance , the single - site dmft can not capture the slater physics caused by nesting effects as is the case in the spin - peierls system tiocl  @xcite where dimerization is important .",
    "( ii ) appearance of non fermi - liquid ( fl ) behavior .",
    "non - fl behavior is present in the single - site dmft calculations for the multiorbital  @xcite hubbard model and in the four - site cellular - dmft ( cdmft ) studies for the one - orbital hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "based on the mentioned calculations , the mechanism of non - fl behavior is attributed to the ferromagnetic correlation between orbitals ( hund s coupling ) in the case of multiorbital systems , while intersite antiferromagnetic correlations caused by the coulomb repulsion are suggested as the driving mechanism in the one - orbital case . in an attempt to consider the effect of spatial fluctuations in the multiorbital hubbard model , we investigated recently the mechanism of non - fl behavior  @xcite within dca .",
    "this study is developed further in the present work .",
    "( iii ) finally , we investigate the competing effect of frustrated orbitals in a multiorbital hubbard model .",
    "such a study has been motivated by the intensively discussed controversy about the origin of the observed reduced magnetic moment in fe - based superconductors  @xcite and the possible relation to the multiorbital nature of the system .",
    "bandstructure calculations together with downfolding for various families of iron - based sc compounds show that weakly frustrated @xmath3 , @xmath4 and highly frustrated @xmath5 , @xmath6 orbitals coexist  @xcite .",
    "we will show in what follows that competition of frustrated with non - frustrated orbitals induces an antiferromagnetic metallic phase with a reduced ordered magnetic moment  @xcite , as observed in iron - based superconductors .",
    "in section  [ model ] we present the model and numerical methods considered which include the single - site dmft , dca and the continuous - time qmc algorithm as impurity solver . in section  [ results ] , we discuss the appearance of orbital selective phase transitions and non - fermi liquid behavior for two models : ( * i * ) the half - filled two - orbital hubbard model with unequal bandwidths on the square lattice in the framework of a four - site dca paramagnetic ( pm ) solution and ( * ii * ) the half - filled two - orbital hubbard model on the bethe lattice with one frustrated orbital and one unfrustrated orbital using the single - site dmft with af ordering . in this model we find an antiferromagnetic metallic phase as well as a reduced staggered magnetization as a consequence of competing frustration effects . finally , in section  [ summary ] we summarize our findings .",
    "we consider the anisotropic two - orbital hubbard model with nearest- and next - nearest- hopping matrix elements : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 and orbital @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the hopping matrix element between site @xmath10 and nearest - neighbor site @xmath14 ( next - nearest - neighbor site @xmath15 ) . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are intraorbital and interorbital coulomb repulsion integrals , respectively , and @xmath18 is the ising - type hund s rule coupling term . in our calculations we set @xmath19 and @xmath20 in order to fulfill the condition @xmath21 and evaluate the model with the single - site dmft and four - site dca methods combined with a continuous - time qmc algorithm .",
    "even though dca can be considered as superior to the single - site dmft method , both approaches are faced with certain advantages and drawbacks .",
    "while the single - site dmft ignores spatial fluctuations , a notorious fermionic sign problem present in the qmc calculations disappears even in the frustrated systems with next nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath22 . on the other hand , while short - range spatial fluctuations are considered in the four - site dca approach , the qmc calculations encounter a serious fermionic sign problem for the frustrated model  @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "we first consider the anisotropic two - orbital model with different bandwidths @xmath12 and no frustration @xmath23 = 0 on the square lattice at half - filling within the four - site dca method ( model ( * i * ) above ) .",
    "although a mild fermionic sign problem with average sign around @xmath24 is observed , we believe that the results are numerically reliable .    in the dca method",
    "the reduced brillouin zone ( bz ) is determined by dividing the total bz with respect to the number of sites and the self - energies for the different cluster momenta are calculated  analogous to the dmft equation  on the reduced bz by considering the same assumption as in dmft where the self - energy is constant in the ( reduced ) brillouin zone .",
    "the dca self - consistent equations for each cluster momentum with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of sites , @xmath29 is the chemical potential , @xmath30 is the dispersion relation , @xmath31 is the matsubara frequency , and the summation over @xmath32 is calculated in each reduced brillouin zone .",
    "next , we will study the anisotropic frustrated two - orbital hubbard model on the bethe lattice at half - filling with @xmath12 and @xmath23 hopping matrix elements ( model ( * ii * ) above ) by employing the single - site dmft with an antiferromagnetic bath . the nel state , in which the magnetization of a and b sublattices are in opposite directions ,",
    "is included in the model and the dmft self - consistency equations are given as @xmath33 the sign problem is absent in the single - site impurity calculations , and the converged impurity green s functions in both cases are determined after several iterations .",
    "two possible continuous - time ( diagrammatic ) qmc algorithms for solving the dmft and dca equations have been proposed .",
    "one is based on an expansion in the impurity - bath hybridization @xmath34  @xcite term  also called strong - coupling approach  and the other one is based on an expansion in the interaction term @xmath16  @xcite , denoted as weak - coupling approach . unlike a determinant qmc method  @xcite which includes the artificial trotter error caused by discretization of the imaginary time , this error is not present in the continuous - time qmc algorithms except as numerical noise .",
    "in addition , since the matrix sizes of both diagrammatic qmc methods are smaller than that of the determinant qmc method , it is possible to access the low temperature regime . for our study",
    "we employ the weak - coupling qmc method .",
    "the reason for this choice lies in the computational effort . while the strong - coupling qmc method for the single - site impurity problem of multiorbital systems has advantages like the possibility of considering the full hund s rule coupling term without any fermionic sign problem and also the calculation at very low temperatures in strong - coupling regions , the numerical effort of such an approach increases rapidly with the number of cluster sites @xmath28 as @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in the multiorbital cluster systems the strong - coupling qmc method is computationally extremely expensive . on the other hand , the weak - coupling qmc method contains less numerical burden because the matrix size increases only linearly with @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we present results which demonstrate the appearance of ospt and non - fl behavior in the half - filled two - orbital hubbard model with different hopping @xmath12 in each orbital @xmath11 on the square lattice ( model ( * i * ) ) by employing the four - site dca calculations with paramagnetic bath .",

    "correlation is the driving force for a transfer of spectral weight from the coherent peak at the fermi level ( @xmath49 to incoherent peaks .",
    "this means that the quasiparticle weight @xmath39 at the fermi surface @xmath50 should be suppressed in a mott insulating state due to enhancement of the effective mass .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figlayer1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xmath39 at @xmath40 in the narrow band is suppressed around @xmath43 , while it remains large in the wide band .",
    "we can denote this feature as an orbital - selective phase where metallic and insulating states coexist between @xmath43 and 3.2 . in order to observe the ospt more clearly at momentum sectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we plot in figs .",
    "[ figlayer1 ]  ( b)-(g ) the spectral functions for @xmath42 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the maximum entropy method was used for analytical continuation .",

    "[ figlayer1 ]  ( f)-(g ) , both phases at @xmath57 are insulating and the gap in the narrow band is larger than that in the wide band .",

    "we first evaluate the ospt behavior of this model with the single - site dmft , as we did within the four - site dca approach in the former section .",
    "we observe that a band insulator is present since the source of the gap opening is not only the coulomb interaction but also the magnetization of the af solution .",
    "therefore , the change of the effective mass  which is related to the quasiparticle weight @xmath80  is very small in contrast to the case of a mott insulator .",

    "the difference between these two results is that @xmath81 for the frustrated orbital of our system also drops to zero at @xmath87 , while it decreases smoothly in the single - site dmft calculation with paramagnetic solution  @xcite .",

    "we find that while the system behaves as a band insulator in the k=(0,0 ) sector of the brillouin zone , it undergoes an orbital selective phase transition in the k=(@xmath97,0 ) sector .",

    "the spectral weight in each orbital shows a gap at the fermi level , indicating a mott insulating state in both orbitals .",
    "the observation of an ospt in the intermediate region is due to the different electron localization in the orbitals .",
    "the non - fl behavior is also present due to weakly ordered states with af correlations between sites and fm correlations between orbitals in the metallic regions .",
    "next , using the single - site dmft with an af solution , we studied model ( * ii * ) and found that the critical interaction @xmath16 for a metal - insulator phase transition are @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the unfrustrated and frustrated orbitals , respectively .",
    "this is a clear evidence of coexistence of two phases between the two critical @xmath16 values .",
    "an ospt is observed in this system since the strength of electron localization in both orbitals is different due to the unequal orbital frustration .",
    "the af states are a key to the gap opening and the nature of the insulating state is that of a band insulator .",
    "finally , such a minimal model may be of relevance to understand the nature of the antiferromagnetic metallic state in the iron - pnictide superconductors as well as the origin of the small staggered magnetization observed in these systems since we measure the magnetization in each orbital and find that the magnetization only increases smoothly as a function of the interaction strength in the antiferromagnetic metallic state .",

    "<S> the anisotropic two - orbital hubbard model with different bandwidths and degrees of frustration in each orbital is investigated in the framework of both single - site dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) as well as its cluster extension ( dca ) for clusters up to four sites combined with a continuous - time quantum monte carlo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this model shows a rich phase diagram which includes the appearance of orbital selective phase transitions , non - fermi liquid behavior as well as antiferromagnetic metallic states . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of employing the single - site dmft with respect to dca and the consequences for the physical picture obtained out of these calculations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we argue that such a minimal model may be of relevance to understand the nature of the antiferromagnetic metallic state in the iron - pnictide superconductors as well as the origin of the small staggered magnetization observed in these systems . </S>"
