    "graphene , as a strictly two - dimensional material , has revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications , and thus has attracted much attention in recent years.@xcite this material is also important for spintronics since the spin relaxation time ( srt ) in intrinsic graphene is expected to be very long .",
    "the underlying reason is the low hyperfine interaction of the spin with the carbon nuclei ( natural carbon only contains 1% @xmath0c with spin ) and the weak spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) due to the low atomic number.@xcite    the study of spin relaxation in graphene is still in the initial stage .",
    "some investigations have been performed on the spin relaxation due to the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism@xcite in graphene.@xcite this relaxation mechanism is from the joint effects of the momentum scattering and the momentum - dependent spin - orbit field ( inhomogeneous broadening@xcite ) .",
    "however , the previous investigations are all in the framework of single - particle approach , thus the electron - electron coulomb scattering , which has been demonstrated to be very important for the spin relaxation in bulk and low - dimensional semiconductor systems,@xcite was not included . understanding the effect of the electron - electron coulomb scattering on spin relaxation in graphene is an important problem . in addition",
    ", the coulomb hartree - fock ( hf ) term acts as an effective longitudinal magnetic field , and hence can increase the srt by more than one order of magnitude for high initial spin polarization in semiconductors at low temperature.@xcite whether it is still valid in graphene remains unchecked .",
    "also , in semiconductors the spin relaxation can be effectively manipulated by the high in - plane electric field.@xcite how the in - plane electric field affects the spin relaxation in graphene is also unclear . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the spin relaxation in graphene from the microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite which has achieved much success in the study of the spin dynamics in semiconductors . via this approach",
    ", we can explicitly include all the relevant scatterings , especially the electron - electron coulomb scattering , and understand the physics raised above .",
    "it is also noted that there is a significant discrepancy between the existing theories and the recent spin transport experiments.@xcite these experiments reported the srts of only about @xmath1  ps , at least one order of magnitude shorter than the lowest value obtained in the theory.@xcite this suggests that the srts obtained in the recent experiments are likely to be limited by an extrinsic mechanisms , e.g. , the local spin - orbit field from the adatoms.@xcite in this paper we concentrate on the relatively cleaner graphene samples by choosing low impurity densities which give a mobility higher than the values in the latest experiments , so that the effect of the adatoms can be neglected .",

    "finally , it is noted that even after considering the soc enhanced by the curvature effect , the srts from our calculation are still two orders of magnitude larger than those in recent spin transport experimental measurements.@xcite we stress that the range of impurity ( adatom ) density of the graphene samples we discuss is different from that in recent experiments , and therefore the dominant spin relaxation mechanism is also quite different .",
    "as mentioned above , the mechanism most likely limiting the srts in the recent experiments is the local spin - orbit field induced by the randomly distributed adatoms .",

    "<S> it is also discovered that the spin relaxation time increases with the in - plane electric field due to the hot - electron effect , which is different from the non - monotonic behavior in semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the electron - electron coulomb scattering in graphene is not strong enough to establish the steady - state hot - electron distribution widely used in the literature and an alternative approximate one is proposed based on our computation . </S>"
