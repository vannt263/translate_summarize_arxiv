    "the inflation paradigm @xcite is successful in explaining the horizon problem , flatness problem and the homogeneity problem in the standard hot - big - bang cosmology .",
    "the generic inflation model predicts a nearly scale - invariant primordial scalar power spectrum which has been measured accurately by the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) such as _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( hereafter _ wmap _ ) @xcite and _ planck _ @xcite satellites .",
    "however , even with precise constraints from cmb temperature fluctuations , there are still many models that predict the values of spectral index @xmath1 and its running @xmath11 which are allowed by the constraints from current data .",
    "recently , the ground - based `` background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization '' experiment just completed its second phase experiment ( hereafter bicep2 ) , which observed the cmb b - mode polarization ( divergence - free mode of polarization ) on angular scales of a few degrees @xcite ( for cosmological implications , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the cmb b - mode polarization can only be sourced by primordial gravitational waves , which is a very clean test of the primordial tensor fluctuations .",
    "results from bicep2  @xcite show that the power spectrum of b - mode polarization @xmath12 on a few degree angular scales is detected at @xmath13 confidence level ( cl ) , which clearly indicates a signature of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "if this is true , it becomes a strong observational support of the scenario in which the universe started from the inflationary exponential expansion , when the primordial tensor fluctuations are produced and stretched to super - hubble length , and later entered into the hubble horizon and decayed at small scales .",
    "indeed , this field of cmb observation has been developing very fast over the past decades and many on - going experiments are seeking such a cmb b - mode polarization signal .",
    "for instance , the _ planck _ satellite with its nine frequency channels may achieve higher signal - to - noise ratio and probe even larger angular scales than bicep2 .",
    "ground - based sptpol @xcite , actpol @xcite , polarbear @xcite and class @xcite experiments are also completing with each other to make more precise measurement on the cmb b - mode polarization signals .",
    "therefore further experiments may precisely determine not only the amplitude but also the shape of the primordial tensor power spectrum , therefore constitutes a direct test of the inflation mechanism .",
    "therefore it is important to connect the predictions from inflation models with the current observational results from bicep2 and _ planck_. in pervious _",
    "wmap _ and _ planck _ analysis papers @xcite , the authors plot the predictions of spectral index of scalar power spectrum @xmath1 and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 of various inflation models with the constraints from cmb data ( fig .  7 in @xcite and fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "while making the prediction of @xmath14@xmath0 relation for a given potential , the variation of the inflaton field is calculated by integrating the equation of motion from the end of inflation to some early epoch .",
    "this duration of inflation is assumed by to around @xmath15@xmath16 number of e - folds ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "although the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation works well , it is worth noticing the underlying assumption that during inflation , the inflaton potential ( which is typically taken as a monomial , for example , @xmath18 ) is the same as that during the first 10 e - folds of observable inflation .    with the recent measurement of tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 ,",
    "this assumption become problematic .",
    "it becomes much more challenging than before to build an inflation model , in which a simple potential describes the total @xmath16 e - folds of inflation without changing its shape and parameters . to see this , remember that the inflationary potential can be perturbatively expanded near a value of @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the change of @xmath9 value during inflation . from the effective field theory point of view , the potential derivatives up to @xmath22 are relevant and marginal operators .",
    "those operators can be naturally turned on without suppression . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath22 and higher derivatives are irrelevant operators , which are suppressed with an energy scale defined by the uv physics ( at most the planck scale ) . for the expansion to converge we need @xmath23 to be smaller than the uv completion scale of inflation .",
    "however , lyth bound @xcite suggests that , the change of the field with respect to the number of e - folds is related to the value of @xmath0 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the reduced planck mass . by substituting the current measurement of @xmath0 from bicep2 @xcite @xmath26 thus per e - fold , @xmath27 . by assuming @xmath28",
    ", we find that the inflaton field moves at least at a distance into account , to avoid model dependence .",
    "otherwise the number in could change , while keep within the same order of magnitude .",
    "also note that it is also possible that @xmath29 is not varying monotonically , to avoid large field inflation @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath30 in its field space .",
    "if this is true , @xmath23 at 60 e - folds is much greater than @xmath31 .",
    "thus the expansion is no - longer valid since all the high derivatives of @xmath32 could in principle contribute along the 60 e - folds of the inflationary trajectory .",
    "the effective field theory of inflationary background is therefore non - perturbative , and becomes out of control for higher order derivatives .",
    "the uv completion of inflation becomes a sharper problem then ever before .",
    "however , the leading uv completion paradigm , string theory , actually makes the problem worse . on the one hand ,",
    "most string inflation models predict much smaller @xmath0 and thus not consistent with the bicep2 data . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic energy scale of string theory is the string scale . for string theory to be perturbatively solvable , strong coupling had better to be small and the string scale should be lower than the planck scale ( say , 0.1 @xmath33 or lower ) .",
    "the size of extra dimension may further lower the string scale .",
    "with such a lower scale as the cutoff , the effective field becomes a greater challenge than that with the planck scale cutoff .    before bicep2 ,",
    "the major challenge for building stringy inflation models is the @xmath34-problem @xcite , with the observational @xmath34 smaller than theoretical expectations .",
    "now , a more serious @xmath29-problem emerges , leaving the observed large @xmath29 for the string theorists to explain .    in the effective field theory point of view , given the current constraint on @xmath0 , we may not be able to trust the inflaton potential along the whole 60 number of e - folds .",
    "this motivates us not to integrate the potential throughout @xmath16 number of e - folds , but to reconstruct the potential @xcite locally .",
    "therefore we focus on a local range of field values , along the first a few e - folds window . in this range , @xmath35 thus the inflationary potential expanded by eq .  (",
    "[ eq : eft ] ) is in better control .",
    "we will show that , assuming small running , with current data it is possible to accurately reconstruct the amplitude and shape of the inflaton potential within the cmb observation window of about 10 e - folds .",
    "however , in the case of large running , the uncertainty of the reconstruction becomes large when @xmath23 is comparable with @xmath36 , which corresponds to a field range of about 3 e - folds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : slow - roll ] , we explain our notations of slow - roll parameters , and show the connection with @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in sec .  [",

    "the slow - roll parameters as derivatives of the scale factor can be defined as @xmath37 note that these are not equivalent to the parameters defined by the derivatives of the inflationary potential .",
    "however , the definitions ( [ eq : def ] ) are increasingly commonly used and their role to keep track of the expansion history of inflation is by itself important .    at the leading order of slow roll",
    ", the scalar power spectrum can be written as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the spectral index of primordial power spectrum , the running of the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio for single - field slow - roll inflation is @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42    given the current measurement of @xmath0 ( eq .

    "the corresponding energy density is @xmath47 which is about @xmath48 times higher than the current large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment .",
    "therefore , the cmb experiment is essentially a high - energy experiment that probes the regime of physics unaccessible by the current ground - based accelerators .",
    "note that @xmath49 is of order the maximal temperature that the universe could get at reheating .",
    "the current preferred value @xmath50 is interestingly near the grand unification scale .",
    "it thus becomes increasingly important to understand the relation between inflation and the grand unification , including model building , reheating mechanism , and possible topological defects which might be produced at the grand unification phase transition .    the tensor power spectrum and its spectral index are @xmath51 where the second equation holds only for single - field slow - roll inflation models .",

    "current data shows @xcite @xmath86 to good precision , one can approximate @xmath87 , considering that @xmath88 is much smaller than the current experimental bound .    on the other hand , for most slow - roll models of inflation , @xmath85 is much smaller than the current bound .",
    "here we shall assume @xmath89 and @xmath90 are of the order @xmath34 or smaller , while consider both cases of large @xmath85 and small @xmath85 , motivated by observations and theory respectively .",
    "in this section we expand the inflationary potential in terms of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "since we are only interested in the range of a few number of e - folds , we are able to locally expand the potential in an effective field theory and have more confident to drop the non - renormalizable terms . in addition , higher order derivatives on the potential are highly suppressed by slow - roll parameters ( and by the largeness of @xmath31 ) practically ( unless the higher order slow - roll parameters are unusually huge ) . thus we derive the derivatives of the potential up to @xmath91th order .    in single field inflation ( without slow - roll approximation ) , the derivatives of the potential can be solved from the slow - roll parameters as @xmath92 slow - roll approximation simplifies the above equations .",
