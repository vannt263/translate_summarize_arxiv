    "accurate knowledge of the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy , r@xmath0 , is important in many fields of astronomy and space science . in particular , the primary motivation for this study was a wish to improve the accuracy of modeling the galactic aberration ( malkin 2011 ) .    over the past decades ,",
    "many tens of r@xmath0 determinations have been made , making use of different principles and observing methods , and thus characterized by different random and systematic errors .",
    "therefore , deriving a best r@xmath0 estimate from these data is not only an astronomical but also a metrological task , similar to deriving the best estimates of the fundamental constants in physics . for the latter",
    ", several statistical methods have been developed to obtain best estimates  as well as their realistic uncertainties  from heterogeneous measurements . in this study , we applied those methods to the r@xmath0 data .",
    "another goal of this study was to investigate a possible trend in the multi - year series of r@xmath0 estimates , as discussed by many authors .",
    "however , estimates of any such trend differ significantly among papers . therefore , we tried to clarify this issue using the latest results .",
    "more details are provided by malkin ( 2012 ) .",
    "for the present study , we used all r@xmath0 measurements published in the period 19922011 , with the exception of a number of results that were revised in subsequent papers .",
    "we did not use the results of glushkova et al .",
    "( 1998 ; revised by glushkova et al . 1999 ) , paczynski & stanek ( 1998 ; revised by stanek et al .",
    "2000 ) , eisenhauer et al .",
    "( 2003 ; revised by eisenhauer et al . 2005 , which was in turn revised by gillessen et al . 2009 ) . in total , 53 estimates ( listed in table  [ tab : allr0 ] ) were used .    where both random ( statistical ) and systematic uncertainties were given , they were summed in quadrature . if two different values were given for the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval , the mean value of these boundaries was used as the uncertainty in the result ( the lower and upper boundaries were close to each other in all cases , so that this approximation procedure does not significantly affect the final result ) . where authors gave several estimates of r@xmath0 without a final preference , the unweighted average of these estimates was computed .",
    ".r@xmath0 estimates used in this study .",

    "although the published r@xmath0 estimates were obtained based on different methods and samples of objects , they are consistent rather than discrepant .",
    "the results of the computation of a mean r@xmath0 value obtained using different statistical techniques converge at the level of approximately 0.1  kpc , which is much smaller than the uncertainty in the average value .",
    "note , however , that this conclusion is not evident .",
    "similar analysis of @xmath1 measurements has shown that the latter are much less consistent .",
    "as significant experience in deriving best estimates of the physical constants has shown , using various statistical methods to evaluate the best r@xmath0 estimate is very important to assess data consistency and obtain realistic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , careful astronomical consideration of the published measurements should be accompanied by a careful statistical analysis .",
    "it should be recognized that the computation of the new conventional iau r@xmath0 value is not only an astronomical , but also a metrological task .",
    "another result of this study is that any trend in the r@xmath0 estimates obtained during the last 20 years is statistically insignificant , which makes it unlikely that r@xmath0 results are significantly affected by a bandwagon effect . on the other hand , the formal errors in the published r@xmath0 estimates improve significantly with time .",
    "note that the average value r@xmath2 kpc computed in this study differs from the results of the latest direct measurements obtained from stellar orbits about sgr a * , trigonometric parallaxes to sgr b2 , and over 60 trigonometric parallaxes of masers , which give r@xmath3 kpc ( m. j. reid , priv . comm . ) , although these values are still formally consistent .",
    "on the other hand , it seems important to properly combine all results obtained based on different methods , because this provides better systematic stability of the average result .",
    "indeed , the systematic and random errors of all these results should be assessed and the corresponding correction should be applied when possible before averaging ( although this is a very difficult task ) ."
