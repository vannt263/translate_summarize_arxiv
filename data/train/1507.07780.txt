    "sonyc - short for _ substellar objects in nearby young clusters _ - is a comprehensive project aiming to provide a complete , unbiased census of substellar population down to a few jupiter masses in young star forming regions .",
    "the survey is based on extremely deep optical- and near - infrared wide - field imaging , combined with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and @xmath10 photometry catalogs , which are correlated to create catalogs of substellar candidates and used to identify targets for extensive spectroscopic follow - up . to further facilitate candidate selection , in @xcite we also performed a proper motion analysis of the lupus  3 star forming region . while the candidate selection based on optical and near - infrared photometry helps to avoid biases",
    "introduced by the mid - infrared selection ( only objects with disks ) , or methane - imaging ( only t - dwarfs ) , it comes with a cost of relatively large candidate lists affected by significant background contamination .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is therefore a necessary prerequisite to reliably characterize the low mass population in young star forming regions .",
    "thanks to our sonyc survey and the efforts of other groups , the substellar initial mass function ( imf ) is now well characterized down to @xmath00.01m@xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of the number of stars with respect to brown dwarfs lies between 2 and 6 @xcite , and the power - law slope of the mass function is @xmath11 @xmath00.6 ( dn / dm@xmath12m@xmath13 ; see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "it is clear by now that the mass function in young clusters extends below the deuterium - burning ( d - burning ) limit at @xmath14m@xmath15 , as a handful of early l - type dwarfs have been spectroscopically confirmed in ngc1333 @xcite , @xmath16 oph @xcite , @xmath17  ori @xcite , @xmath18  ori @xcite , orion @xcite , and cha - i @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of the current surveys are complete down to @xmath19m@xmath15 , leaving the mass function in the planetary - mass regime still poorly constrained .",
    "the surveys that extend to lower masses are mostly based on photometry , and still await spectroscopic follow - up . the sonyc study in ngc  1333 ( scholz et al .",
    "2012b ) is unique in this sense , as we obtained spectra of more than 85% of all photometric very - low - mass ( vlm ) candidates down to @xmath20m@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the free - floating objects with planetary masses are rare , 20 - 50 times less numerous than stars ( for planetary mass objects in range 0.006 - 0.015m@xmath5 , and stars below 1m@xmath5 ) .",
    "the mass spectrum in ngc  1333 below 0.6m@xmath5  is well described by a power - law form @xmath7 , with @xmath21 , and possibly requires lower values of @xmath11 in the planetary - mass domain . in @xmath18",
    "ori , @xcite find the same slope for the mass interval 0.250.004 m@xmath5 , and also suggest a possibly lower @xmath11 below 0.004m@xmath5 .",
    "while this result still awaits spectroscopic confirmation , three t - dwarf candidates towards @xmath18  ori have been classified as likely non - members @xcite , suggesting that the mass function in this cluster might have a cut - off at @xmath04 m@xmath15 . in the central part of upper scorpius , spectroscopy of l - type candidates",
    "@xcite and proper motions of t - type candidates @xcite favor a turn - down of the mass function below 10 - 4m@xmath15 , depending on the age assigned to the cluster , and the models used . in another photometric survey probing the planetary - mass range in the same region , but over much larger field , @xcite concludes that the mass function ( in the log - normal form ) is likely decreasing in the planetary - mass regime , although the flat function can not be discarded at this point . a proper - motion and/or spectroscopic analysis of the candidate members is needed before drawing a firmer conclusion .",
    "the surveys in star forming regions thus far are possibly in conflict with the claims of the microlensing study by @xcite , who suggest that the unbound or wide - orbit jupiter - mass objects are almost twice as common as main sequence stars .",
    "one possible mechanism for the formation of objects of this kind might be ejection of bds , and/or star forming clumps through close encounters in the early stages of cluster formation . however , the typical ejection velocities produced by simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) of up to a few kms@xmath22 might result in a population of bds distributed at the outskirts of the clusters , but not very far from it .",
    "certainly some objects at the tail of the velocity distribution might escape even further , but this can not be a substantial number .",
    "for example , at the end of the cluster simulation in @xcite , only about 17% of the low - mass stars and bds are at the distances beyond the 80%-mass radius of the cluster .",
    "therefore , if the microlensing result holds , the objects they probe should have masses below @xmath23m@xmath5 , and their over - abundances would favor a different formation scenario from the one forming the non - d - burning brown dwarfs in young clusters .    within sonyc , we have investigated the imf in the two young star forming regions , chamaeleon - i ( hereafter cha - i ; @xcite ) , and lupus  3 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the second spectroscopic follow - up of the sonyc candidates in these two regions . based on this more complete set of follow - up spectra , we can better constrain the properties of the imf at the low - mass end . in cha - i specifically , we target the candidates expected to have masses below the d - burning limit , in order to derive more definitive conclusions that contribute to the ongoing discussion about the imf in this mass regime . in section [ obs&dr ]",

    "the latter is important since we can derive firm statistical conclusions on the shape of the imf only in the region where our surveys can be considered complete .",
    "while the cha - i star forming region spreads over several square degrees on the sky , more than 80% of the known members lie within a @xmath26deg@xmath27 central stripe ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the sonyc photometric survey provided deep images of a part of this area , covering in total @xmath00.25deg@xmath27 .",
    "our fields contain 38% of the cha - i population according to the most complete census to date presented in @xcite .",

    "nir photometry is in the 2mass system .",
    "the @xmath29-band photometry was not absolutely calibrated , and is only used to separate the red from the blue sources in the ( @xmath33 ) color space ( see @xcite for details ) . ] .",
    "a list of candidate members of cha - i was selected from the ( @xmath34 ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , representing a natural extension of the previously known members towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "this list contains 142 candidate members , with @xmath28-band magnitudes between 17.5 and 24 .",
    "for cha - i members within this brightness range , bt - settl models @xcite predict masses roughly between 0.002 and 0.06m@xmath5 , for a@xmath35 , while the entire lupus  3 area appears to have a@xmath36 .",
    "we therefore use this as an upper value of extinction when deriving mass limits from the photometry . ] , and an age of 1 - 2 myr .",
    "the completeness limit of the @xmath37band catalog is 23 mag , which is equivalent to @xmath38m@xmath5  for a@xmath35 at 1 myr , or @xmath39m@xmath5  at the age of 2 myrs ( median age of cha - i members when compared to theoretical isochrones ; @xcite ) , and the distance of 160 pc .",

    "if indeed members of cha - i , the objects between these two lines should have masses between 0.003 and 0.015 m@xmath5  at 1myr or between 0.004 and 0.02  m@xmath5  at 2 myr ( for a@xmath35 ) .",
    "red diamonds mark spectroscopically confirmed members of cha - i , from sonyc and @xcite , while crosses mark non - members from @xcite .    for the second follow - up with the sofi / ntt , we targeted the sources with expected masses in the planetary - mass regime detected in our nir images ( the filled dots in the left panel of figure  [ cmd ] , located between the two horizontal lines ) , and not previously observed with vimos ( squares ) .",

    "the sonyc photometric survey in lupus  3 covers 1.4deg@xmath27 of the main cluster core , surrounding the two brightest members hr5999/6000 .",
    "previous surveys by @xcite and @xcite cover approximately this same area , plus the lower - density part of the complex to the north - east of the main core .",
    "this part , however , contains only about 10% of all the candidate members identified in the two aforementioned works .",
    "the original list of photometric candidates in lupus  3 presented in @xcite was selected from the ( @xmath46 , @xmath32 ) cmd , and contained 409 candidates .",
    "although in our catalogs we removed the sources too close to the edges of the chips , and overly elongated or blended sources ( based on sextractor output ) , some extended sources ( galaxies with almost round profiles , unrecognized doubles ) and a few artifacts ( source sitting right on a bad column , or a spike of a nearby bright object ) still made it to our candidate catalog .",
    "total of 37 contaminants of this type were found by visual inspection of the images , and have been removed from the candidate list .",
    "the final candidate list then contains 372 sources",
    ". this list can be further narrowed - down to 58 , taking into account the proper motions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as in the previous paper , we refer to this list as the `` ij - pm '' candidate list .",

    "the magnitude range of the candidate list @xmath49 is equivalent to masses 0.2 ",
    "0.007m@xmath5  for @xmath50 .",
    "in @xcite , we presented the first spectroscopic follow - up using vimos / vlt , where we took spectra of 123 photometric candidates , out of which 32 are from the `` ij - pm '' list .",
    "spectra confirmed 7 of these objects as young members of lupus  3 , all belonging to the `` ij - pm '' list .",
    "for the second follow - up , the sofi spectroscopy presented here , the targets were selected from the `` ij - pm '' list not covered by the vimos follow - up , and above the completeness limit .",
    "the second follow - up includes 19 candidates , listed in table  [ t_exp ] .",

    "the spectra were taken using sofi ( son of isaac ; @xcite ) at the eso s new technology telescope ( ntt ) during four nights in april 2014 , under the program number 093.c-0050(a ) .",
    "sofi is equiped with a hawaii hgcdte @xmath51 detector , with the pixel size projected onto the sky of @xmath52 .",
    "we used the low resolution red grism ( gr grism red ) covering the wavelength range 1.5 - 2.5 @xmath1 m , and delivering spectral resolution r@xmath53 when combined with the @xmath54 slit ( 31 spectra ) , and 300 with the @xmath55 slit ( 3 spectra ) .",
    "the seeing during the sofi observations was varying between 0.7 and @xmath56 ( values from the differential image motion monitor ; dimm ) , and the transparency was clear , except for the first few hours of the night 2014 - 04 - 17 , when some clouds have been present .",
    "the wider slit was used for the patricularly faint sources ( @xmath57 ) , during less favorable seeing conditions .",
    "the typical nod throw along the slit was @xmath58 .",
    "the complete sofi target list , along with the information about the date of observation , on - source integration time , and slit used , is presented in table  [ t_exp ] .",
    "data reduction was performed by combining the sofi pipeline recipes , our idl routines , and iraf task @xmath59 .",
    "the data reduction steps include cross - talk , flat field , and distortion corrections .",
    "pairs of frames at different nodding positions were subtracted one from another , shifted , and combined into a final frame .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the iraf task @xmath59 , and wavelength calibrated with the help of the xenon lamp arcs .",
    "the wavelength solution obtained by the pipeline has an rms error of @xmath60 .",
    "the spectra of telluric standard stars were reduced in the same way as science frames .",
    "telluric standards spectral types range between b5v and b9.5v , and show several prominent hydrogen lines in absorption , which were removed from the spectra by interpolation , prior to division with the black body spectrum at an appropriate effective temperature .",
    "this yields the response function of the spectrograph , convolved with the telluric spectrum . finally , we divided the science spectra by the corresponding response function .",
    "the error of the response function is the combination of the errors of the measured telluric spectra and the errors in the effective temperature assigned to certain spectral types .",
    "the latter is caused by assumption that the instrinsic spectrum of the calibrating star is well described by a black body of a certain temperature .",
    "the error of the measured telluric spectra is supplied by @xmath59 , through the @xmath61 keyword .",
    "it is of the order , or below 1% across most of the spectrum , except in the region between h and k - bands where the atmosphere absorbs most of the light .",
    "for the b - type telluric standards , we adopted the temperature scale from @xcite , whose @xmath62 error on the effective temperature translates to approximately @xmath63 error in the response curve .",

    "the latter scale was designed to be compatible with the evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the uncertainties in spectral types , these temperature estimates are subject to a systematic uncertainty in the temperature scale , which is difficult to predict , since it depends on various details of the models , and is probably at least @xmath128k @xcite .",
    "we therefore decide to adopt a single value of @xmath98k for all objects in the plot .",
    "different uncertainties in luminosity for objects hotter , or cooler than 2750k in figure  [ hr ] , result from the uncertainties in bc@xmath122 that were adopted from two different works @xcite .",

    "the underluminosity of the young members of star forming regions can be explained by the object being seen only through scattered light ( edge - on disk , or embedded class i sources ) , or by the accretion - modified evolution , similar to what is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the examples of the detail modeling of young underluminous objects with edge - on disks can be found in e.g. @xcite .    in cha - i ,",
    "the sequence of the objects hotter than @xmath132k is following the isochrones , and is mostly confined between those marking 1 and 10 myr .",
    "most of the coolest objects , on the other hand , fall between 10 and 100 myr , i.e. they appear systematically underluminous relative to theoretical isochrones .",
    "one possible culprit are the bolometric corrections used to calculate the luminosities .",
    "to calculate bc@xmath122 for these objects , we use the relation from @xcite , which was derived for the field dwarfs . as summarized previously in @xcite ,",
    "the bolometric corrections for young l and t dwarfs are probably not the same as those for standard field dwarfs , which may lead to underestimated luminosities for the young dwarfs .",
    "the bolometric corrections appropriate for the young late m and l dwarfs are not yet available , but a few individual values do exist in the literature . for example , @xcite derive bc@xmath122=@xmath133 for a young l3 dwarf g196 - 3b , whereas a field dwarf of the same spectral type would have bc@xmath122=@xmath134 @xcite .",
    "this difference in bc@xmath122 shifts an object by @xmath135dex in the positive y - direction , i.e. enough to fall above the 10 myr isochrone .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite , studying two planetary - mass companions to young stars , suggest that the effect might be caused by an overestimate of the @xmath91 .",
    "they were able to reproduce the observed properties of the two objects by modeling low - gravity , cloudy atmospheres experiencing non - equilibrium chemistry , and requiring the @xmath91 that is several hundred k lower than reported earlier .",
    "therefore , the position of the coolest objects in the hr - diagram with respect to the theoretical isochrones can reflect a problem with the bolometric luminosities and/or the atmosphere models in this @xmath91 regime .",
    "the latter is possibly due to treatment of dust in various models , as clouds start to form in the atmospheres of cool dwarfs with @xmath136k @xcite .",
    "based on the survey presented in this work , we can put limits on the number of vlm sources that are missing in the current census of ysos in cha - i . as in other works from the sonyc series ,",
    "we use the success rates of our spectroscopic follow up ( defined as a number of confirmed members divided by the number of the spectroscopically surveyed candidates ) , to estimate the expected number of members among the remaining photometric candidates . the listed uncertainties are the 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) , calculated using the clopper - pearson method , which is suitable for small - number events , and returns conservative cis compared to other methods @xcite .    while until now for this estimate we always considered the entire candidate lists above the completeness limit , in case of cha - i it might be more suitable to divide the candidate list in two , and consider the candidates with @xmath137 , and those with @xmath138 separately . the reason for this is the following .",
    "the candidate list with @xmath137 contains 46 objects .",
    "we took 16 spectra with vimos , and confirmed 7 members .",
    "this gives a success rate of @xmath139 ( 95% cis ) . among the candidates with @xmath138 that were specifically targeted in this most recent follow - up",
    ", we took in total 17 spectra ( 15 with sofi and 2 with vimos ) , and confirmed only 1 probable vlm members of cha - i ( the other red diamond in figure  [ cmd ] marks iso - chai-192 , whose spectral type is unclear ) .",
    "the success rate is therefore @xmath140 , which is significantly lower than for the candidates with @xmath137 .",
    "the difference can not be caused simply by different wavelength domains used in spectroscopy ( optical versus nir ) , as all but one of the members confirmed with vimos have @xmath91 below 3500k , and would have also been recognized in the nir . from the success rates mentioned above , we can now estimate the number of missing vlm members in our candidate list .",
    "the number of unconfirmed members among the remaining candidates in a sample can be calculated by subtracting the number of spectra taken by sonyc and number of objects observed by other groups from the total number of candidates in the sample , multiplied by the success rate . in the higher brightness bin ( @xmath137 ) , among our 46 candidates without sonyc spectra , we find additional 8 objects classified as members , and 4 non - members from @xcite .",
    "thus , the number of missing vlm objects with ( @xmath137 ) is @xmath141 .",
    "if we now consider the @xmath138 part of the @xmath24 cmd , it contains 60 candidates , of which 17 have sonyc spectra .",
    "one probable vlm member was confirmed by sonyc , and one additional vlm was confirmed in other surveys .",
    "we estimate therefore the expected number of members in this bin to be @xmath142 .",

    ", we can update the mass function based on the follow - up presented in this work . for this",
    "we take into account only the candidates above the completeness levels of our survey .",
    "the updated success rate in the `` @xmath145-pm '' sample is therefore @xmath146 , while for the photometric - only candidates we have @xmath147 . as in the previous section",
    ", the number of unconfirmed members among the remaining candidates in a sample can be calculated by subtracting the number of spectra taken by sonyc and number of objects confirmed by other groups from the total number of candidates in the sample , multiplied by the success rate .",
    "therefore , the estimated number of unconfirmed members in our survey is @xmath148 .",
    "the first term in this equation refers to the `` @xmath145-pm '' sample , the second to other ( photometric only ) candidates , and the quoted error is the 95% ci .",
    "we can repeat the same calculation to get an approximate number of missing bds above the completeness limit , but the result is essentially the same as for all vlm objects , i.e. any of the 0 - 11 missing objects could be either stellar or substellar .    based on these numbers ,",
    "it is evident that very few potential vlm members of lupus  3 are left to be discovered , at least down to the completeness limit of our survey , which is equivalent to @xmath149m@xmath5 , for a@xmath1445 .",
    "our survey covers a large portion of the entire lupus  3 cloud , and encompasses the entire high - extinction band around the two herbig ae / be members ( see figure  1 in @xcite ) where majority of the known members are located .    comparing lupus  3 with cha - i , we note that the success rate of spectroscopic confirmation of vlm candidates is significantly lower in the former , despite having used a homogenous method for selecting candidates .",
    "this can be explained by different contamination rates by background objects along the two lines of sight .",
    "the galactic longitude of lupus  3 is @xmath150 , which means that we are looking towards the inner , more densely populated parts of the galaxy , compared to regions along the line of sight to chamaeleon ( @xmath151 ) . the besanon milky way stellar population synthesis model @xcite yields about five times more objects in the direction of lupus  3 , than towards cha - i , within the same area on the sky and for the same photometry limits .",
    "lupus  3 is at the same time less populated : the current stellar census in this region contains roughly 80 members , while in cha - i there are @xmath0180 .",
    "higher contamination by background sources , combined with a smaller overall population is therefore the most plausible cause for different success rates in our spectroscopic surveys .      in figure  [ spt_distr ]",
    "we show the distributions of spectral types for the spectroscopically confirmed vlm population in lupus@xmath863 ( left panel ) , and cha - i ( right panel ) , found within the region covered by our surveys .",
    "the solid error bars are poissonian confidence intervals calculated with the method described in @xcite .",
    "we do not try to correct the histograms for the missing objects estimated in the previous section , because it is not clear which spectral type they would have . assuming that they have moderate extinction ( a@xmath152 )",
    ", we could distribute them in the substellar bins of the two histograms .",
    "however , our previous surveys have revealed a significant number of more embedded stellar members in the same part of the cmd where those moderately - extincted substellar members are found . in any case , the numbers of missing members are low , especially in lupus  3 , and they can not strongly affect the spectral type distribution .    the overall trend seen in the two histograms is very similar , with a rise in the number of objects at spectral types earlier than m5 , a peak at m5 , and a drop in the number of objects at later spectral types .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in other star forming regions , e.g. ic 348@xcite , @xmath16 oph @xcite , and ngc  1333 @xcite . the sharp drop in the number of objects at spectral types m7 and",
    "later is seen in all these distributions , and is certainly a real feature of the imf , and can not be attributed to the incompleteness of each survey , especially in cha - i where we are complete down to @xmath0l3 .",
    "the survey in lupus  3 is somewhat shallower , but from the analysis in section  [ discuss_lupus ] it is evident that there are very few new members left to be discovered in this region down to @xmath0l0 .",
    "even if we assume that all the objects missed by our surveys are substellar ( i.e. in the bins m7 and later ) , the drop at late spectral types would remain .",

    "clearly , there are a number of uncertainties involved in this calculation , such as the choice of the isochrones and extinction law used to derive masses , or uncertainties in distances to star forming regions . in lupus  3 ,",

    "to probe finer differences , one needs a more sophisticated analysis and better constraints on fundamental parameters .      with the masses calculated as described in the previous section , we can construct the imfs in cha - i and lupus  3 .",
    "they are shown in figure  [ imf ] , where we varied the binsize in order to achieve similar numbers of members in each bin .",
    "we choose to express the imf in the power - law form , as @xmath172 .",
    "the data needed to reproduce the plot are given in table  [ t_imf ] .",
    "in cha - i the best fit yields @xmath173 ( black solid line ) .",
    "we can also account for the number of objects missing in our census , as estimated in section  [ discuss_chai ] .",
    "it is not simple to predict the masses that these `` missing '' objects should have , because of the variable extinction in star forming regions , where more massive embedded stellar members might mix in the color - magnitude space with the less embedded substellar members .",
    "however , if we assume the typical a@xmath174 , then our missing members should be substellar .",
    "the objects in the @xmath138 bin were included in the lowest - mass bin ( @xmath175m@xmath5 ) , as they are expected to have masses below 0.015m@xmath5 .",
    "objects with @xmath176 should have spectral type m7 - l0 , and we distribute half of those in each of the two lowest - mass ( substellar ) bins . with this correction , the best - fit power - law index ( dashed red line ) becomes @xmath177 .",
    "the slope remains essentially unchanged if we put all the missing objects with @xmath176 to the more massive of the two substellar bins ( 0.03 - 0.075m@xmath5 ) . despite the caveat mentioned above",
    ", this short exercise tells us that even in the ( somewhat extreme ) case that all the missing members were substellar , the slope of the imf would not be strongly affected .    in lupus  3 , we get the best fit single power - law index @xmath178 ( bottom panel of figure  [ imf ] ) . here",
    "the lowest - mass bin contains all the substellar objects . while in cha",
    "- i all the data points seem to be consistent with a single power - law , in lupus  3 there might be an indication of the flattening of the slope in the substellar regime . for a comparison , we show the segmented power - law imf by @xcite , where the power - law slope changes at 0.5 and 0.08m@xmath5 .",
    "the kroupa imf , normalized to match the middle point of the lupus  3 imf at 0.155m@xmath5 , is shown by the dashed grey line in the lower panel of figure  [ imf ] , with the slopes @xmath179 for m@xmath180m@xmath5 , @xmath181 for @xmath182m@xmath5 , and @xmath183 for m@xmath184m@xmath5 .",
    "the possible turnover in the power - law mass function in the substellar regime that we observe in lupus  3 , has not been , to our best knowledge , reported in any other spectroscopically confirmed sample of a young cluster .",
    "one possible exception is the young , sparsely populated association @xmath185 cha , which beside the population of @xmath015 stars of spectral type k and m , does not contain any bds down to 0.015m@xmath5@xcite . assuming the star - to - bd ratio of 1.5  6 that we find for lupus  3 and cha - i",
    ", one would expect a population of 3  10 bds .",
    "however , a comparison of the mass distributions in @xmath185 cha , cha - i , and ic  348 by means of a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test , does not reveal a significant difference between the three clusters @xcite .    to test the significance of our findings for the lupus 3 power - law mass function , we first add the upper limit of 11 missing members to the substellar bin .",
    "the objects have random masses above our completeness limit for a@xmath92=0 ( 0.009m@xmath5 ) , and below the substellar limit .",
    "this case is extreme , both regarding the number of missing objects ( the estimate from section  [ discuss_lupus ] was @xmath186 ) , and by the assumption that all the potentially missing members would be substellar , since some , or even all of them could equally be stellar .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ imf_lup ] , represented by blue crosses and histogram .",
    "after adding the missing members , the bins have been redistributed to contain similar numbers of objects .",
    "black circles and histogram show the spectroscopic imf from figure  [ imf ] , restricted to masses above our conservative completeness limit at a@xmath187 ( 0.02m@xmath5 ) .",
    "we see that even after adding the upper limit of the possibly missing objects , the flattening of the slope remains . a second suitable test concerns possible influence of the extinction .",
    "here , we derived masses and a@xmath92 simultaneously by fitting the photometry to the predictions of the evolutionary models .",
    "alternatively , we could have fixed the a@xmath92 to the value derived from spectroscopy , or from a single intrinsic color ( e.g. @xmath121 , as in section  [ s_hrd ] ) . since for the majority of the objects",
    "these values do not differ by a large amount , the resulting imf looks unchanged . to further test the impact of the extinction value used to derive masses , we varied the a@xmath92 by a random amount in the interval @xmath188mag from the spectroscopic value .",
    "we have done this 1000 times for each object , and finally adopted the average mass from all the variations .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ imf_lup ] , with red open circles .",
    "we see that this has a small impact on the shape of the imf .",
    "as mentioned earlier in the paper , members of lupus  3 typically have low extinction ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "in fact , the spectroscopic sample used to plot the imf contains 98% of members with a@xmath190 . at a@xmath191 , a 0.07m@xmath5  object would fall right at the completeness limit of our survey , i.e. at the extinctions above 10 , we would not be able to detect substellar objects .",
    "however , we do not expect that many bd could be hiding at high extinctions , because in this case we should have also found some highly embedded stellar objects . the optical part of our spectroscopic survey would be sensitive to those , but we detect only one such source ( sonyc - lup3 - 1 ) , whose spectrum and sed suggest a rare geometrical configuration ( edge - on disk ) .",

    "the presence of massive ob stars might influence bd formation in clusters , since bds could form through photo - evaporation of prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "however , nearby star forming regions ( @xmath207pc ) contain extremely small populations of ob stars ( only one b star in lupus , and three in cha - i ) , and their influence on the imf of these clusters must be negligible .",

    "the data are therefore consistent with a monotonic power law mass spectrum across the d - burning limit , and down to @xmath00.005m@xmath5 .    in ngc 1333 , we find similar monotonic behavior of the low - mass imf across the d - burning limit , but do not exclude a shallower slope below this limit ( i.e. @xmath213 ) .",
    "in fact , based on more recent information about the mid - infrared colors of young ultracool objects @xcite , our upper limit on the number of the planetary - mass bds is probably too conservative , and is likely to be lower ( 4 instead of 8) .",
    "this suggests a possible break in the power - law around d - burning limit . in @xmath214ori , @xcite report the imf consistent with a smooth power law with @xmath215 down to 0.004m@xmath5 . in the range 0.004 ",

    "the saturation of their survey matches the completeness limits of ours , and their @xmath218 detection limit is at @xmath219mag .",
    "the number of the cool photometric candidates identified in the survey by @xcite is consistent with statistical expectation of a background population .",
