    "one of the subjects where a great deal of attention has been focused in the last two decades is the dynamics of nonlinear lattices .",
    "intrinsic localized modes or _ discrete breathers _ is one of the most outstanding structures that arise in those lattices @xcite .",
    "discrete breathers are periodic and localized solutions whose existence is allowed by the interplay between discreteness and nonlinearity . the existence of those structures in networks of anharmonic oscillators ( also known as klein - gordon lattices ) was firstly proven at 1994 by mackay and aubry @xcite .",
    "they established that discrete breathers can be continued from the anti - continuous limit ( i.e. the limit where there is no coupling between the oscillators ) to finite coupling as long as no integer multiple of the breather frequency resonates with the linear modes in the phonon band .",
    "this theorem also demonstrates the existence of breathers with more than one excited sites , dubbed as _",
    "these multibreathers receive special names in some cases ; for instance , breathers with all their sites excited receive the name of _",
    "phonobreathers_. if all but one of the sites are excited the multibreather is called a _ dark breather _ @xcite , in analogy to the dark solitons existing in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite .    in order to observe experimentally discrete breathers",
    ", they have to be stable .",
    "the stability of one - site breathers ( i.e. breathers with only one excited site ) was firstly proven in @xcite .",
    "it was not until 2003 where some of the authors of the present paper developed a method for determining the stability or instability of many kinds of multibreathers @xcite based on the aubry s band theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . an alternative approach , introduced in @xcite , is based in previous work by mackay _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "recently , the equivalence between both approaches has been proven @xcite .",
    "most of theoretical work related to discrete breathers has been carried on time - reversible solutions of hamiltonian lattices .",
    "non - time - reversible solutions have mostly been considered in dissipative lattices @xcite , which have many experimental applications in chains of coupled pendula @xcite , micromechanical arrays @xcite , transmission lines @xcite and josephson junction arrays @xcite .",
    "however , there have been very few approaches to non - time - reversible breathers or multibreathers in hamiltonian lattices .",
    "the existence of one of such solutions was firstly proven in the pioneer work of mackay and aubry @xcite .",
    "it was restricted to phonobreathers where there is a constant phase difference between adjacent sites .",
    "these solutions can transport energy by means of _ phase torsion _ and can be viewed as nonlinear phonons or _",
    "phasons_. later on , aubry @xcite demonstrated the existence of a generic non - time - reversible breather , independent on the excited sites .",
    "the proof was also extended to inhomogeneous lattices ( e.g. with vacancies ) and vortices .",
    "it was also proven that phonobreathers with phase torsion generate a stationary flux , and that time - reversible phonobreathers can not transport energy .",
    "finally , cretegny and aubry numerically demonstrate @xcite the existence of non - time - reversible phonobreathers in homogenous and inhomogeneous ( with vacancies ) 1-d lattices and vortices and breather `` rivers '' ( i.e. percolating clusters of breathers connecting two boundaries submitted to phase torsion ) in 2d square lattices .",
    "they also sketch some properties of the flux and its stability in 1d lattices .",
    "further applications of this theory can be found in many publications on discrete vortices in dnls @xcite and klein - gordon @xcite lattices .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we will prove by making use of the techniques developed in @xcite , a result mentioned in passing on ref .",
    "@xcite : the stability of phonobreathers depends on the phase difference between adjacent sites and the phonobreather frequency . on the other hand , we will make an analysis of the stability and flux dependence on the system parameters for two kind of potentials in klein - gordon lattices , checking the validity of the analytical predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the model equations ; section [ sec : mst ] deals with the analytical results regarding the stability for low coupling ; in order to check these results , we make an exhaustive numerical analysis of the existence and stability of phonobreathers at finite coupling in section [ sec : stab ] ; finally , we present our conclusions and some possible extension of this work in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we a consider a klein  gordon chain of oscillators with nearest - neighbours harmonic coupling .",
    "the dynamical equations are of the form :    @xmath0    where the variables @xmath1 are the displacements with respect to the equilibrium positions , @xmath2 is the on  site potential , @xmath3 is the number of oscillators , and @xmath4 is the coupling constant .",
    "we consider two paradigmatic cases of on - site potentials : morse ( soft ) potential    @xmath5 ^ 2\\ ] ]    and @xmath6 ( quartic ) hard potential    @xmath7    we look for non - time - reversible solutions of the dynamical equations ( [ eq : dyn ] ) with all the particles excited , so that the difference between the phases of the temporal oscillations of two nearest - neighbours lattice sites is a constant @xmath8 .",
    "thus , there is a phase torsion between the boundaries of the lattice of value @xmath9 . in order to fit the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and , in consequence , @xmath12 .",
    "hence , we are dealing with an anharmonic plane wave ( or a phonobreather ) with a wave number equal to @xmath8 that transmits an energy flux along the chain of oscillators @xcite .",
    "let us remark the similarities of non - time - reversible phonobreathers with q - breathers , which are localized solutions in the reciprocal space ( see @xcite for fpu and @xcite for dnls lattices ) .",
    "q - breathers can be generally considered as the superposition of a finite number of normal modes .",
    "the solutions considered in the present paper , i.e. phonobreathers , are also localized in the reciprocal space , so they can be cast as a special case of q - breathers , consisting only of a normal mode characterized by the wavenumber @xmath8 .    in order to calculate phonobreather solutions",
    "we make use of methods based on the anti - continuous limit  @xcite , that is , an orbit of frequency @xmath13 for each isolated oscillator is calculated and the coupling constant is subsequently varied with a path - following ( newton - raphson ) method . in this paper , we have used a fourier space implementation of the dynamical equations .",
    "fourier space methods are based on the fact that the solutions are @xmath14-periodic ( for a detailed explanation of these methods , the reader is referred to refs .",
    "thus , they can be expressed in terms of a truncated fourier series expansion :    @xmath15    with @xmath16 being the maximum of the absolute value of the running index @xmath17 . in the numerics , @xmath16 has been chosen as 13 .",
    "after the introduction of ( [ eq : series ] ) , the dynamical equations ( [ eq : dyn ] ) transform into a set of @xmath18 algebraic equations where the variables are @xmath19 :    @xmath20+{\\varepsilon}(2z_{k , n}-z_{k , n-1}-z_{k , n+1})=0\\ ] ]    here , @xmath21 denotes the discrete fourier transform :    @xmath22=\\frac{1}{2k_m+1}\\sum_{j =- k_m}^{k_m}v'(u(t_j))\\exp(-i k { \\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t_j),\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is a sample of times that must be chosen equally spaced :    @xmath24    and @xmath25 is calculated from the fourier coefficients @xmath26 by means of the inverse discrete fourier transform :    @xmath27    fourier space methods provide with an analytical form of the jacobian @xmath28 , whose elements are @xmath29 . figs .",
    "[ fig : breather1 ] and [ fig : breather2 ] show the profiles and time evolution of two examples of phonobreathers with different phases and potentials .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the study carried out in this paper has been twofold : on the one hand , analytical predictions on the stability of non - time reversible phonobreathers has been established by making use of the multibreathers stability theorem ; on the other hand , a numerical study on the existence and stability properties of those phonobreathers has been performed .    the multibreathers stability theorem predicts that there is a critical value of the phase difference in phonobreathers that separates stable and unstable states .",
    "this critical value depends on the phonobreather frequency for lattices with harmonic coupling and morse on - site potential whereas , for the @xmath6 potential , the critical value is @xmath30 and does not depend on the frequency . at this particular value of the phase",
    ", the theorem can not make any prediction about the ( in)stability .",
    "the analytical findings have been confirmed by means of numerical analysis , showing in addition that the stability changes above a given value of the coupling constant .",
    "it has also been confirmed that , in most cases , the aubry s band displacement predicted by the multibreather stability theorem for small coupling , is valid even for relatively high coupling . apart from this , it has been observed that phonobreathers cease to exist above a critical value of the coupling .",
    "this value coincides with a flux divergence for the morse potential or a flux vanishing for the hard @xmath6 potential .",
    "finally , it has been found that for the @xmath6 potential with @xmath31 , the ( in)stability depends on the frequency even for infinitesimally small coupling , being additionally confirmed that a second - order perturbation theory is needed in order to predict the ( in)stability at this particular value of the phase .",
    "the above mentioned results open new perspectives for future work . for instance",
    ", we have started to study the properties of vortices in square lattices , which can be pictured as multibreathers with @xmath31 .",
    "it can be interesting to apply the multibreathers stability theorem to two structures considered by cretegny and aubry : ( i ) breather `` rivers '' ( percolating cluster ) firstly and ( ii ) phonobreather with vacancy sites .",
    "finally , we have also started to study the effect of long - range interactions in the stability of non - time reversible structures .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the micinn project fis2008 - 04848 .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the critical value of the coupling parameter @xmath32 for the on - site potentials considered in the paper , i.e. the morse and the @xmath6 potentials , by making use of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this method consists in considering all the fourier coefficients zero but the first one , as this is usually considerably larger that the other coefficients .",
    "the rwa gives often surprisingly good results , taken in account its simplicity .",
    "let us consider equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyn ] ) :    @xmath33    we can write @xmath1 and @xmath34 in terms of their fourier coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath35 as    @xmath36    as @xmath37 , substituting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app : dyn ] ) we obtain    @xmath38    let us calculate the coefficients @xmath39 for the generic @xmath6 potential @xmath40",
    ". then @xmath41 or    @xmath42    as @xmath43 is real @xmath44 and , therefore , within the rwa @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "for a given @xmath47 , we can always set @xmath48 by choosing the appropriate time origin ; that is @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we only need to find the coefficients for the site @xmath47 as we can deduce any other one by using @xmath51 .",
    "let us write @xmath52 , @xmath53 and so on , for simplicity .",
    "then    @xmath54 + [ \\exp(3 i{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t)+\\exp(-3 i{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t)])=      \\nonumber\\\\      & \\mbox { } & ( z_1 + 3s\\,z_1 ^ 2)(\\exp(i { \\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t)+ \\exp(-i { \\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t ) ) + s z_1 ^ 3 ( \\exp(3 i{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t)+\\exp(-3 i{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}t))\\ , .",

    "substitution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app : fou1 ] ) for @xmath47 ( omitted ) gives @xmath57 .",
    "this equation has two solutions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which becomes also zero for the critical value of the coupling parameter @xmath32 given by :    @xmath60    therefore , @xmath61 and so are @xmath62 and @xmath1 within the rwa . the flux @xmath63 also becomes zero , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "this result does not depends on the value of @xmath64 , which measures de degree of nonlinearity of the potential . as any hard symmetric",
    "potential can be approximated by the @xmath6 potential with some @xmath65 , @xmath66 is a good approximation for all of them .",
    "however , for a soft symmetric potential @xmath64 is negative , @xmath67 , and as @xmath4 there is no value of the coupling that nullifies @xmath68 and the flux can not be nullified .    for the morse potential ,",
    "the rwa approximations is not so useful . from the numerical results we know that the critical coupling @xmath32 corresponds to a divergence of the flux @xmath63 , and therefore to a divergence of @xmath1 and its first fourier coefficient @xmath62 .",
    "then , @xmath69 tends to zero when @xmath70 and so does @xmath71 . by substitution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app : fou1 ] ) for @xmath72 , neglecting @xmath71 and simplifying @xmath62 we get @xmath73 and the critical coupling is    @xmath74    we have not been able to deduce the reason why @xmath1 becomes infinity .",
