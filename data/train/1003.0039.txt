    "understanding the evolution of galaxies  especially the first generation of galaxies  remains one of the most important topics in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "populations of galaxies in the distant universe are identified over a wide range of wavelengths , including distant red galaxies ( drgs ) , ultra luminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs ) and sub - millimieter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "many efforts to study the properties of high redshift galaxies at optical wavelengths focus on two distinct classes selected by their rest - frame uv properties : 1 ) lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) and 2 ) lyman-@xmath1 emitters ( laes ) .",
    "lbgs are selected via deep wide - band photometry , identified by the ` lyman limit ' continuum break that appears at 912   in the rest frame @xcite  though for sources at higher redshift this spectral break moves redward , approaching 1216   in the rest frame due to the lyman-@xmath1 forest @xcite absorption by intergalactic neutral hydrogen .",
    "laes are selected by either narrow - band imaging @xcite or blind spectroscopy @xcite tuned to detect lyman-@xmath1 line emission redshifted into near - ultraviolet , optical , or near - infrared wavelengths . over the past decade",
    "large samples of lbgs and laes have driven studies of star - forming galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "surveys for lbgs and laes are efficient for collecting statistical samples of high - redshift galaxies , but at @xmath20 they produce objects which are generally too faint to have their galactic continuum emission studied spectroscopically .",
    "the standard approach for studying the properties of these galaxy samples relies on stacking the photometric signal from many objects and fitting the observed mean sed against a variety of stellar population synthesis models in order to constrain parameters such as the ages and masses of the underlying stellar populations , as well as the amount of dust extinction @xcite . in principal",
    ", stellar population synthesis modeling can also provide information about dust properties ( i.e. the shape of the dust law ) and metallicity , but even the stacked sed signal at @xmath20 is insufficient to constrain these additional parameters with much confidence .",
    "broadly speaking , galaxies selected as lbgs are believed to sample more massive star - forming galaxies with an underlying older stellar population , and possibly higher dust content , while lae selected galaxies tend to be lower mass galaxies with low metallicities and very little dust @xcite .",
    "hubble space telescope imaging studies of high redshift lae galaxies imply that these sources are compact , and likely either disk - like or irregular in structure @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite modeled individual seds of 14 bright @xmath21 laes from the chandra deep field south and found a broad range in stellar population age , stellar mass , and dust extinction , which suggests that stacking sed analyses of high redshift galaxies may not be the best approach .",
    "the main hurdle involved in studying any high redshift source is the general lack of signal .",
    "distant galaxies are faint and therefore difficult to detect , and those which are identified are rarely  if ever  amenable to detailed follow - up .",
    "furthermore , those sources which are bright enough to be studied individually are drawn from the extreme bright tail of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies , and are therefore not necessarily representative of the bulk of the populations . in this paper",
    "we present two serendipitously discovered , strongly lensed high redshift galaxies : , spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 mags , and spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath26 , with @xmath27 mags , @xmath28 mags and @xmath29 mags .",
    "both objects have @xmath30 colors and magnitudes that satisfy selection criteria for @xmath31band dropouts in @xmath0 dropout surveys , as well as lyman-@xmath1 equvialent widths ( see section 2 ) sufficiently large to be selected in surveys for lyman-@xmath1 excess . at @xmath32",
    "these objects are the two brightest laes in the literature to date , and both sources are projected on the sky within  @xmath33 of the cores of confirmed strong lensing galaxy clusters .",
    "this means that the sources  once corrected for the lensing magnification  are intrinsically much fainter than the observed flux implies , and therefore provide a rare opportunity to study individual lae properties at the fainter end of the luminosity function .",
    "there is a small but growing number of magnified galaxies at high redshift that are excellent candidates for high resolution spectroscopic follow - up @xcite ; some of these galaxies have been observed in detail at optical and near - infrared wavelengths , including cb58 @xcite , `` the 8 oclock arc '' @xcite , and `` the cosmic eye '' @xcite .",
    "the two galaxies discussed in this paper are the first @xmath0 galaxies that present similar opportunities for detailed study via follow - up spectroscopy .    where necessary we calculate cosmological distances assuming a flat cosmology with @xmath34 km s@xmath35 mpc@xmath35 , and matter density @xmath36 .",
    "all magnitudes are ab .",
    "the two sources presented here were first identified as @xmath37band dropouts in @xmath38 imaging of two different strong lensing galaxy clusters , and subsequently confirmed by spectroscopy to have strong lyman-@xmath1 emission features .",
    "the two galaxy clusters were identified as part of the sloan giant arcs survey ( sgas ; * ? ? ? * ) , a blind survey for strong lensing systems in optically selected massive clusters at @xmath39 detected via the red - sequence cluster algorithm @xcite adapted to run on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) public data release catalogs .",
    "strong lensing clusters are identified by visual inspection of imaging in @xmath40band on 2 m to 4m - class telescopes for 600s in @xmath41 seeing , and the most spectacular systems have been followed - up with multi - band imaging and spectroscopy on 8m - class telescopes .",
    "one of the clusters discussed here , sdss j1343 + 4155 , appears in a recent small sample of strong lensing clusters discovered in the sdss by @xcite . the other cluster , sdss j0915 + 3826 , does not appear in any prior published work .",
    "imaging and spectroscopic observations were conducted with the frederick c. gillett telescope ( gemini north ) between the months of 2008 february and 2008 july .",
    "the gmos imaging observations were pre - imaging conducted for the purpose of spectroscopic mask design .",
    "both imaging and spectroscopy were part of gemini program gn-2008a - q-25 .",
    "the primary goal of the spectroscopic observations was to obtain redshifts of arcs to facilitate strong lensing modeling .",
    "we briefly summarize the spectroscopy here , and refer the reader to bayliss et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , in preparation , for additional details .",
    "gemini north / gmos @xmath38 photometry for both cluster fields are derived from 2x150s dithered exposures , which were executed in queue mode on february and march of 2008 .",
    "these pre - imaging data were used for spectroscopic mask design and target prioritization .",
    "gmos @xmath42band observations consisted of 6x180s dithered exposures which were scheduled as follow - up , primarily in order to measure the continuum flux of the laes , and were executed in queue mode in february of 2010 .",
    "the gmos images were reduced using the gemini iraf package .",
    "in addition to the gmos - n photometry and spectroscopy , we obtained near - infrared ( nir ) imaging of the two lensing clusters in the @xmath43 filters with the near - infrared camera and fabry - perot spectrometer ( nic - fps ) of the 3.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory ( apo ) in new mexico .",
    "the detector is a rockwell hawaii 1-rg 1024x1024 hgcdte device with a pixel scale of @xmath44 pixel@xmath35 and a @xmath45 arcmin unvignetted field of view .",
    "the apo / nic - fps @xmath46 data differs from the gemini / gmos @xmath47 significantly due to the different wavelength responses of the nic - fps and gmos detectors .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the two filters are offset by @xmath48 , and we use the prime ( @xmath49 ) throughout this paper to distinguish the apo / nic - fps @xmath46 from the gemini / gmos @xmath47 .",
    "the nir data were taken on 3 different nights in the winter and spring of 2009 .",
    "the conditions during the observing nights varied , with sub - arcsecond seeing for the sdss j1343 + 4155 @xmath50band and both @xmath51band images . the sdss j0915 + 3826 @xmath50band and",
    "both @xmath52-band images were taken in @xmath53 seeing .",
    "the observations consisted of 5-point dithers around a @xmath54 box and were reduced , registered and stacked using a custom iraf pipeline .",
    "total exposure times are 5400s , 6960s and 3500s for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52-band observations of sdss j0915 + 3826 and 7800s , 5160s and 2625s for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52-band observations of sdss j1343 + 4155 .    the sdss was used to calibrate the four optical bands and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) was used to calibrate the nir observations . prior to making any photometric measurements we first transform images in all bands to the reference frame of the @xmath55band image , @xmath56 pixel@xmath35 ( gmos - north detector , binned 2x2 ) .",
    "we then construct an empirical , normalized point spread function ( psf ) for each image based on a well - defined , non - saturated reference star .",
    "we create photometric apertures by drawing a ridge line that covers the high - redshift lae and convolving it with the appropriate psf for each image .",
    "apertures are defined by an equivalent radius , which corresponds to the radius of a circular aperture that goes out to the same isophot .",
    "we make the final magnitude measurement using a detailed sequence of sky subtraction and outlier masking steps ; first we subtract a general sky measurement and then compute the median pixel value and standard deviation inside annuli of fixed width at increasing radial distances from the source . far enough out , these median values converge to zero for an accurate sky subtraction .",
    "we average the median values at large radii and subtract this average from the image to correct the general sky subtraction .",
    "outliers are defined as pixel values that deviate by more than 5@xmath57 from the median in the respective annuli , and are replaced by the median value plus an appropriate noise term .",
    "the final magnitude is measured at an equivalent radius of twice the fwhm of the psf and corrected to an equivalent radius of @xmath58 based on the curve of growth of the psf . by defining the radius as twice the fwhm",
    ", we make sure our apertures always cover the same physical region on the sky . in the case of sgas j091541 + 382655 , a foreground galaxy lies very close to and partially on top of the lae galaxy .",
    "we use the @xmath59 package @xcite to fit a sersic profile to this galaxy in the imaging data where the lae has no measureable flux , and then scale the galaxy model by the peak flux in each band and subtract it out before measuring the lae magnitudes .",
    "when the laes are not detected ( in @xmath60 for sgas j091541 + 382655 and @xmath61 for sgas j134331 + 415455 ) , we measure a limiting magnitude , derived from the total sky noise in the aperture .",
    "we define a sky noise per pixel @xmath62 as the standard deviation of our overall sky measurement plus a contribution from the poison error made in this measurement .",
    "a pixel value of @xmath63 is added in quadrature for each pixel in our final aperture with an equivalent radius equal to twice the fwhm .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are also aperture corrected to an equivalent radius of @xmath58 .",
    "this method constrains the source to be fainter than the limiting magnitudes at @xmath64 confidence in the relevant bandpasses .",
    "all spectroscopic observations were carried out using the gemini multi - object spectrograph @xcite using custom slitmasks that were designed to target lensed sources based on their color , morphology , and positoin in the gmos imaging .",
    "after targeting all of the arc candidates , any remaining slits were placed on cluster members , easily identified by their red sequence colors .",
    "spectra were taken using the macroscopic nod - and - shuffle ( n&s ) mode available on gmos .",
    "the reasons for using n&s are threefold .",
    "first , many of the emission or absorption features that are used to determine galaxy redshifts in the range @xmath65 characteristic of the giant arcs , are in the redder part of the optical where sky lines are problematic , and n&s facilitates more accurate sky - subtraction @xcite , particularly at low spectral resolution .",
    "second , n&s sky - subtraction allows us to use very small @xmath66 microslits that can be densely packed into the cluster core ( @xmath67 ) , allowing us to target as many arcs , arclets , and cluster galaxies as possible @xcite .",
    "third , as we are primarily interested in a number of objects around the cluster center , the density of objects and the limited field of interest are perfect for block - shuffling n&s observations .",
    "spectra were taken with the r150_g5306 grating in first order which gives a dispersion of @xmath68   per pixel ( binned spectrally by two ) , with six pixels per resolution element resulting in a spectral fwhm  @xmath69 km s@xmath35 .",
    "although the r150 grating offers broad spectral range from the atmospheric cutoff to @xmath70 , the drop in sensitivity at the blue and red extremes , due both to the gmos ccd and the r150 grating efficiency , results in effective spectral coverage of @xmath71  .    the n&s technique employed in our program is nonstandard in that it involves a nod distance on the sky that is half the size of the macroscopic shuffle .",
    "the mask is designed to incorporate two submasks , each of which is a set of slits covering an area one third the size of the detector .",
    "slits for the two submasks overlap on the sky in an area that is one sixth the size of the detector ( because the nod distance is set to half the shuffle distance ) .",
    "this design allows us to place science slits for the primary target  the core of a strong lensing cluster in this case  on both submasks and obtain useful spectra for the entire duration of the n&s exposure , whereas standard macroscopic n&s results in science spectra for only half of the total exposure time .",
    "our integration times were 2400s resulting in a 1200s effective integration for each of the two submasks .",
    "two exposures were taken for each target .",
    "thus if an arc was targeted on both submasks ( typical for the most prominent arcs ) the total integration time was 4800s .",
    "n&s facilitates straightforward sky subtraction by differencing two sections of the detector ",
    "each 1/3 the size of the full detector .",
    "the spectra presented here were wavelength calibrated , stacked , extracted and analyzed using a custom pipeline based on the xidl software packagexavier / idl / index.html ] .",
    "sdss j0915 + 3826 is a new strong lensing cluster that was discovered in the sgas  discussed above .",
    "we measure redshifts for 16 cluster members in our gemini / gmos spectroscopy and combine this new data with a redshift for the bcg measured in the sdss to identify a mean cluster redshift of @xmath72 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath73 km s@xmath35 .",
    "the most prominent strong lensing feature around this cluster is a bright blue arc that we identify as a background galaxy at @xmath74 from o[ii]@xmath75 , cii]@xmath76 , ciii]@xmath77  in emission , as well as aiii@xmath78  in absorption .",
    "pre - imaging of this cluster reveals a source near the cluster core that exhibits a dramatic drop in flux from the @xmath55 to @xmath37band , as shown in figure  [ dropout ] .",
    "with gemini / gmos - n , in @xmath79 , we measure this source at @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "slits were placed on this source in both submasks for our n&s observation of this cluster and the spectra exhibit bright emission at @xmath84   which we interpret as lyman-@xmath1 @xmath85  at @xmath2 .",
    "the lae galaxy in this case is located on the sky very near to a foreground galaxy , and so we took care to account for possible contamination in the lae spectrum by light from the galaxy that falls into the slit , as this could mimic a continuum break in the source spectrum .",
    "the separation between the lae box slit and the potentially contaminating foreground galaxy is @xmath86 .",
    "examination of the radial profile of the potential contaminant in the pre - imaging observation shows that the @xmath87-band flux within the lae slit due to the galaxy is on average 1.5@xmath8810@xmath89 of the peak flux of that galaxy .",
    "the mean @xmath87-band flux of the lae within the spectroscopic aperture is 5.1@xmath8810@xmath90 compared to the peak of the contaminating galaxy , and thus assuming comparable seeing between the imaging and spectroscopic observations suggests that this object s contribution to the @xmath87-band flux within the lae aperture is approximately @xmath91 of the total light .",
    "note that given the separation between the contaminant and the slit the seeing of the spectroscopic and imaging observations would have to be grossly different to produce significant contamination ; such a mismatch is neither expected due to execution of the observations in specified conditions in queue mode , nor suggested by the spatial width of stellar spectra within the alignment boxes of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the relevant part of the extracted spectrum is displayed in figure [ spec0915 ] , and despite the low dispersion grating used for our observations the line is measurably asymmetric .",
    "we also detect continuum signal redward of the emission line and no significant signal blueward of it .",
    "this source has a strong photometric @xmath92 break  even after subtracting the emission line flux from the @xmath55band photometry .",
    "it is also very blue in @xmath93 , and is not detected in nic - fips imaging to a 2-@xmath57 limiting magnitude of @xmath94 , indicatingg that the continuum spectral slope redward of the emission feature is blue .",
    "the blue continuum redward of the emission and the strong @xmath92 break  along with the non - detection in @xmath95 , and the asymmetry of the line confirm the interpretation of the source as a lyman-@xmath1 emitting galaxy at high redshift .",
    "the most likely candidate emission lines which confuse searches for high - redshift laes are o[ii]@xmath96 , [ oiii ] @xmath97  and h-@xmath1 , but for each of these other candidate lines we would expect accompanying emission features to fall within the wavelength coverage of our spectroscopy .",

    "the relatively small wavelength range used the continuum level is consistent with a constant value .",
    "we note that our spectral flux calibration uses a standard from the gemini archive to correct roughly for the detector sensitivity as a function of wavelength , but is not suitable for measuring absolute fluxes from the spectral data . taking into account the underlying continuum and the source redshift we measure a rest - frame ew for the lyman-@xmath1 emission of @xmath99 , and combine the ew measurement with our @xmath100band photometry to calculate an observed lyman-@xmath1 line flux of @xmath10110@xmath102 ergs s@xmath35 cm@xmath90 .",
    "the second lensed lae presented here is located near the strong lensing cluster sdss j1343 + 4155 , which was previously identified as a strong lensing cluster in the sdss by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we combine our gemini / gmos spectroscopy with two cluster member redshifts from the sdss to measure a mean cluster redshift of @xmath104 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath105 km s@xmath35 from 7 cluster member galaxies .",
    "the bright arc around this lens is spectroscopically identified by @xcite as a background galaxy at z@xmath106 .",
    "pre - imaging of this cluster reveals a source near the cluster core that exhibits a dramatic drop in flux from the @xmath55 to @xmath37band  shown in figure  [ dropout ] .",
    "we measure this source at @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "we placed slits on this source in each of the two submasks for our spectroscopic n&s observations of this cluster .",
    "the spectra corresponding to these slits exhibit a bright emission line at @xmath111 , which we interpret as lyman-@xmath1 @xmath85  at @xmath3 .    the extracted spectrum around the emission feature is displayed in figure  [ spec1343 ] .",
    "the emission feature is significantly asymmetric and we measure continuum emission redward of the line , but no continuum blueward .",
    "the source is undetected in nic - fips imaging down to a 2-@xmath57 limiting magnitude of @xmath112 .",
    "similarly to the case of sgas j091541 + 382655 , this source has a blue @xmath93 color and our nir photometry implies that it has a blue continuum spectral slope redward of the emission feature . the most likely candidate emission line which could be misinterpreted as lyman-@xmath1 in this spectrum is o[ii ] @xmath96 , but we rule this out as a realistic interpretation based on the absence of h-@xmath113 @xmath114  and o[iii ] @xmath115 , both of which should fall just within the spectral range covered by our data if the source were a very red galaxy at lower redshift .",
    "other common contaminants in searches for high - redshift laes include [ oiii ] @xmath97  and h-@xmath1 , but in each of these cases we would also expect to observe other accompanying emission features given the wavelength coverage of our spectroscopy .",
    "we measure the equivalent width of the lyman-@xmath1 emission by fitting a simple power - law to the continuum spectrum redward of the emission line over a wavelength range of @xmath116 , and subtracting the underlying continuum flux from the integrated flux from the emission line .",
    "similar to the continuum fit for sgas j091541 + 382655 , the continuum level for sgas j134331 + 415455 is consistent with a constant value .",

    "using the measured equivalent widths and @xmath119 magnitudes we also calculate lensed isotropic lyman-@xmath1 line luminosities of l@xmath120 erg s@xmath121 and l@xmath122 erg s@xmath121 for sgas j091541 + 382655 and sgas j134331 + 415455 , respectively .",

    "sfr@xmath8 is lower than sfr@xmath141 by a factor of @xmath142 , which is consistent with previous studies finding that the sfr calculated from lyman-@xmath1 emission is often systematically lower than other sfr metrics  such as uv continuum flux density at 1500   by a factor of @xmath143 or more @xcite .",

    "neither source is detected at @xmath163 , which limits our ability to make detailed morophological measurements or shape fits , but we can check the object profiles against the image psfs and use our estimates of the magnification due to lensing to place some rough constraints on the physical sizes of these galaxies .",
    "studies of lae morphologies at @xmath145 using @xmath164 imaging find that the lyman-@xmath1 and restframe uv emission from these sources are spacially coincident and have half - light radii @xmath165kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that s / n@xmath166 is necessary to make robust measurements of half - light radii for laes , and find that it is difficult to distinguish between resolved and unresolved compact cores at s / n@xmath167 .",
    "the two lensed laes are best - detected in our gemini / gmos @xmath100band imaging , so this is the data we use for our morphological measurements .",
    "sgas j134331 + 315455 is slightly elongated in the tangential direction with respect to the center of the cluster .",
    "we measure its profile to be consistent with a gaussian along the tangential axis with a fwhm@xmath168 , and consistent with a gaussian of fwhm@xmath169 along the radial axis .",
    "the fwhm of the psf measured from stars in the image is @xmath170 , suggesting that the lae is unresolved along one axis and resolved along the other .",
    "this kind of morphology is natural for a strongly lensed background source where the magnification is generally much greater along one axis that the other ; a source located on the tangential caustic will be highly magnified in the tangential direction with respect to the center of the lensing potential , and magnified very little or not at all in the radial direction .",
    "we conclude that sgas j134331 + 415455 is unresolved in the radial direction and barely resolved in the tangential direction . assuming that all of the magnification factor of @xmath171 is applied in the tangential direction , we convert a fwhm of @xmath172 into a physical linear size of @xmath173kpc , which indicates that most of the emission from this galaxy originates from a region very compact in size .",
    "this constraint must be taken with the caveat that the data are lower s / n than would be optimal , but the signficant linear magnification of these sources due to gravitational lensing does enable us to probe very physically interesting scales even with ground - based imaging .",

    "the flux in the @xmath100band filter is @xmath176 lyman-@xmath1 line emission , whereas the @xmath130band filter measures only rest - frame uv continuum emission . given the spatial coincidence of the lae in the @xmath100 and @xmath130bands we conclude that the uv continuum and lyman-@xmath1 emission can not originate from regions separated by more than of order @xmath175 projected onto the sky .",
    "we have no measurement of the relative velocities of the uv continuum and the lyman-@xmath1 emission and therefore can not constrain a possible separation in velocity .",
    "sgas j091541 + 382655 is similar to sgas j134331 + 415455 in that the lae is elongated on the tangential axis relative to the center of the lensing cluster . using the @xmath59 subtracted @xmath100band image",
    ", we measure the lae to be resolved in the tangential direction , having a shape consistent with a gaussian of fwhm@xmath177 , which equates to a constraint on the physical scale of @xmath178kpc , where the lower limit on the magnification of this source translates to an upper limit in the physical size ( and again assuming that the magnification is entirely along the tangential diretion ) .",
    "we also measure the lae to have a gaussian shape with @xmath179 in the radial direction , which  given the fwhm@xmath180 measured from the psfs of stars in the image  is consistent with the source being unresolved in the radial direction . in the observer frame",
    "the equivalent width of the lyman-@xmath1 emission for this source is ew@xmath181 , from which we estimate that lyman-@xmath1 photons are contributing less than @xmath182 of the @xmath100band flux , so that we can not make any attempt to measure a spatial offset between the lyman-@xmath1 and uv continuum emission .",
    "our size constraints for both sources are in good agreement with the literature , in that we find the sizes of the laes to be consistent with compact sources of size @xmath165kpc .                  with several photmetric measurements in hand for each of our sources",
    "it becomes interesting to investigate the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the laes to try and recover the properties ( e.g. stellar mass , age , sfr , and dust content ) of the underlying stellar populations in a way that does not rely on as many problematic assumptions as , for example , the sfr estimated from the rest - frame uv continuum flux that we calculate in section 3.1 above .",
    "we compare our photometry for these sources against modified stellar population synthesis models .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite , we only summarize the main procedure here .",
    "we use the revised templates of bruzual and charlot ( cb07 , based on @xcite ) with solar metallicity , a chabrier initial mass function @xcite and @xcite dust extinction law .",
    "we investigate a range of exponentially declining star formation histories of the form @xmath183 , with @xmath184folding times @xmath1850.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 and 5 gyr , as well as single bursts ( ssp ) and continuous star formation models ( csf ) .",
    "an updated version of the code @xmath186 @xcite is used to obtain the best - fit sed at the fixed spectroscopic redshift of the source via a maximum likelihood procedure .",
    "the best - fit sed for sgas j091541 + 382655 is shown in figure [ fig : sed0915 ] and corresponds to a dust - free single burst with an age of 1.4myr .",
    "it is important to supplement the best - fit stellar population parameters with confidence intervals allowed by the photometric uncertainties .",
    "we create 1000 fake realizations of the observed sed by perturbing each broadband magnitude measurement in a manner consistent with its errorbars .",
    "this set of fake seds is fit in exactly the same manner as described above for the observed sed ; bad fits with @xmath187 are excluded .",
    "this procedure results in a very young ( age @xmath188 5myr ) and dust - free ( @xmath189 ) stellar population . though we can place constraints on the age of the observed stellar population , are data are not sufficient for the sed fits to simultaneously constrain the star formation history , and consequently the current star formation rate , for this galaxy . after correcting for a lensing magnification factor of @xmath190",
    ", we find a chabrier stellar mass of m@xmath191 m@xmath15 .",
    "sgas j134331 + 415455 is detected in only 2 bands , which is insufficient to produce a robust best - fit stellar population .",
    "instead , we compare the photometry to single burst , dust - free cb07 models of different ages to obtain some constraints on the age and stellar mass .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : sed1343 ] .",
    "the age of the observed stellar population lies in the range between 100myr and 400myr , which makes sgas j134331 + 415455 significantly older than the very young stellar population seen in sgas j091541 + 382655 . after correcting for a lensing magnification factor of 12 , we constrain the corresponding stellar masses to be within the range",
    "@xmath16 m@xmath17 m@xmath18 m@xmath15 .",
    "all of our photometric data for both of these sources sample light blueward of the 4000  break in the source frame so that the stellar population parameters obtained from the sed fitting procedures correspond to the most recent episode of star formation in each lae ; we have no power to constrain stellar mass that may be present in an underlying population of older stars .",
    "in addition to sed modeling of the photometry of both laes , we also examine the modest continuum signal that is detected for sgas j091541 + 382655 .",
    "cross correlation of our gmos spectrum for this source over a wavelength range of 1230 - 1350  ( source frame ) against the composite lbg spectrum from @xcite results in a peak at @xmath192 , in agreement with the redshift measured from the lyman-@xmath1 emission .",
    "we explicitly exclude the lyman-@xmath1 emission portion of the spectrum in this analysis so that the cross - correlation signal that we detect is entirely due to low - significance continuum features redward of lyman-@xmath1 .",
    "the composite lbg from @xcite is plotted with our gmos spectra for both targets in figures  [ spec0915 ] and [ spec1343 ] , and visual comparison of the continuum against the lbg composite spectrum suggests the presence of several strong uv metal absorption lines that are observed in well - studied lbgs at lower redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the features are at too low a significance in our data to claim a robust detection of individual absorption lines , but the cross correlation signal alone is encouraging given our low resolution spectra and limited integration time .",
    "both of the sources presented here are excellent candidates for a more aggressive spectroscopic followup effort to explore the gas properties and stellar metallicity in representative low - mass starforming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we have identified two lensed lyman-@xmath1 emitting galaxies at @xmath0 near the cores of strong lensing selected galaxy clusters .",
    "these sources are among the brightest galaxies identified at such high redshift , but their intrinsic luminosities are much lower than the observed flux due to magnification by the gravitational potential of foreground galaxy clusters .",
    "we use the available data to investigate the underlying stellar populations for these galaxies and find that the light ",
    "continuum and line emission  for sgas 091541 + 382655 likely originates from a population of young stars with low dust content .",
    "both sources are in the process of undergoing active star formation .",
    "our analysis of these two laes corroborates our current understanding of the nature of lyman-@xmath1 emitting galaxies at high redshift , and the large magnification of these sources due to gravitational lensing makes them excellent candidates for studying the individual properties of galaxies on the faint end of the l@xmath8 and l@xmath141 luminosity functions at @xmath0 .",
    "we encourage efforts to followup these sources aggressively on 8 - 10 m class telescopes in order to better study the properties of the underlying stellar populations via continuum light .",
    "these sources are also excellent targets for space - based observations , both with current @xmath164 instruments and with @xmath193 in the future ."
