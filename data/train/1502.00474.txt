    "emerging patterns due to coarsening are encountered in a huge variety of systems @xcite , ranging from magnetic systems @xcite to complex fluids @xcite and from competition in bacterial colonies @xcite to opinion dynamics in social systems @xcite .",
    "the general understanding of phase ordering kinetics @xcite is well developed for a range of systems , notably those that are curvature driven and where the size of a typical domain increases with the square root of time .",
    "power - law growth is also observed in other instances , as for example in systems with a conserved order parameter undergoing ostwald ripening @xcite .",
    "however , coarsening processes in more complex systems can yield a domain growth much slower than the algebraic growth observed in the simpler situations @xcite .",
    "systems where a logarithmic growth of the form @xmath1 is expected include spin glasses and disordered ferromagnets",
    ". in general , it is challenging , both in experimental and numerical studies , to reach the very long timescales needed to fully access the asymptotic regime .",
    "this has been a vexing issue of many years for spin glasses . on the other hand , disordered ferromagnets , while still being challenging systems , are more easily dealt with in that regard , and over the years a range of studies focusing on elastic lines in disordered media @xcite and on disordered ising systems @xcite , including the one - dimensional random field ising model @xcite , have shown that the asymptotic growth regime is indeed non - algebraic and compatible with a logarithmic growth of the domains .    a logarithmically growing length scale is not restricted to disordered systems , but is also encountered in some systems dominated by dynamical constraints rather than by quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "anomalous coarsening with logarithmic domain growth has been identified in a variety of situations with dynamical constraints , as for example in the @xmath0 model introduced by evans et al @xcite , where three different particle types swap places asymmetrically , in the model discussed by lahiri and ramaswamy @xcite , where two sublattices are considered with two types of particles on each sublattice , or in the driven two - lane particle system studied by lipowski and lipowska @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the one - dimensional @xmath0 model has enjoyed much attention in recent years @xcite , due to its unique properties combined with its amenability to exact calculations in some special cases .",
    "thus the @xmath0 model provides an opportunity to study exactly the long - range correlations in a system undergoing a non - equilibrium phase transition as well as to elucidate ensemble inequivalence far from equilibrium .    whereas most of the papers on the @xmath0 model focused on steady - state properties , only few studies directly addressed the coarsening process , the logarithmic growth and other issues related to this anomalous slow process . after having identified the anomalous slow domain growth in the @xmath0 model , evans et al @xcite proposed a simplified interface model where domains rather than individual sites are updated . in @xcite",
    "slow coarsening was shown to also exist in a two - dimensional version of the @xmath0 model .",
    "finally , in @xcite the focus was on the interface model in one dimension whose study provided some insights into aging and dynamical scaling in presence of a logarithmically growing length .",
    "in this paper we aim at further elucidating slow coarsening and relaxation processes in both the one- and two - dimensional @xmath0 models . in order to do so",
    ", we study a range of different quantities ( the time - dependent space - time correlation function and the length scale obtained from it , two - times quantities like the autocorrelation and response functions , as well as the mean displacement of individual particles during the coarsening process ) that allow us to gain a good understanding of the non - equilibrium processes taking place in this system .",
    "we thereby discuss different regimes that can be identified during the coarsening process .",
    "the effects of the system size and of the swapping rate on the domain ordering are discussed .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section we recall the model , both in one and two space dimensions , and introduce the quantities that we study in the remainder of the paper .",
    "section iii is devoted to a discussion of the time - dependent lengths that govern the coarsening process .",
    "whereas asymptotically the length in the horizontal direction increases as a logarithm of time , complicated early time regimes emerge , depending on the degree of asymmetry and the extent of the system .",
    "additional insights are provided by the mean displacement of individual particles . in section",
    "iv we study two - times quantities . whereas the autocorrelation exhibits obvious dynamical scaling properties , a complicated response of the system to perturbations ( realized through a sudden change of the swapping rates )",
    "is observed .",
    "we summarize our results in the final section .",
    "we consider particles of three different types ( called @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) moving on a two - dimensional lattice with @xmath5 sites and periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath6- and @xmath7-direction .",
    "whereas in the @xmath7-direction all exchanges are symmetric and happen with rate 1 , in the @xmath6-direction a bias is introduced that yields an asymmetry in the exchanges and , concomitantly , an asymmetrical diffusion of the particles @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by allowing exchanges between particles on neighboring sites in the horizontal direction to take place with the following rates : @xmath8 i.e. a @xmath3 particle and an @xmath2 particle to the right of the @xmath3 particle will swap places with rate 1 , whereas the same two particles will swap places with some rate @xmath9 in case their order is different .",
    "unbiased exchanges are of course recovered when @xmath10 . the driven diffusive motion that results when @xmath9 entails phase separation and the formation of ordered domains in the form of vertical stripes @xcite that are arranged in repetitions of the sequence @xmath0 where @xmath2 stands for a domain occupied by a majority of @xmath2 particles .    for comparison , we also simulate the @xmath0 model on a ring composed of @xmath11 sites @xcite where the same biased rates are used as for the horizontal direction in the two - dimensional model .    most of the data discussed below have been obtained for systems with @xmath12 .",
    "we carefully checked that this horizontal length is big enough so that it does not yield finite - size effects for the times accessed in our simulations .    in all our simulations",
    "we consider fully occupied lattices where initially every species occupies exactly one third of the lattice sites chosen at random .",
    "this is in fact a special situation in one space dimension , as detailed balance is then fulfilled @xcite so that the system relaxes to an equilibrium steady state : in case of identical coverage of the lattice by each of the species , a hamiltonian with long - range interactions can be derived .",
    "however , as soon as the particle densities are not the same for all three species , detailed balance is broken in one dimension and the steady state is a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the phase transition between the ordered phase for @xmath13 and the disordered phase at @xmath10 ( in the large volume limit ) then becomes a non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite which has been at the center of some of the recent studies dealing with the @xmath0 model .",
    "for the two - dimensional model , however , detailed balance is always broken , even when the three particle densities are identical , and the steady state is always a non - equilibrium steady state @xcite .",
    "we are using a standard scheme for our simulations where we randomly select a neighboring pair of sites . in case",
    "the particles occupying these sites belong to different species , they are exchanged with the direction - dependent rates given above .",
    "we define a time step as @xmath14 such proposed updates , where @xmath15 is the total number of sites forming the lattice .",
    "every lattice site @xmath16 can be characterized by a time - dependent three - state potts variable @xmath17 . using that description",
    ", an exchange of particles occupying neighboring sites corresponds to updating the values of the potts variables characterizing these sites . in this way",
    "it is also very easy to write down expressions for the quantities measured in our simulations .",
    "a central quantity for our analysis is the equal - time spatial correlation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the sum is over all lattice sites , and @xmath20 stands for an ensemble average over both initial configurations and noise realizations .",
    "the subtraction by @xmath21 assures that in an infinite system @xmath22 goes to zero when @xmath23 .    the space - time correlation ( [ eq : spacecorr ] ) allows the extraction of a time - dependent correlation length .",
    "as we use different swapping rates in horizontal and vertical directions , the spatial correlation , and therefore the correlation length , is direction dependent .",
    "for example , in the horizontal direction a time - dependent length @xmath24 can be obtained in a standard way by determining the intersection of the normalized correlation @xmath25 with a constant function @xmath26 : @xmath27 we carefully checked that the qualitative features of @xmath24 discussed below do not depend on the chosen value of @xmath26 .",
    "the data shown in the following have been obtained for @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , a time - dependent horizontal length can be obtained by measuring the average horizontal extent of a connected cluster formed by particles of the same species .",
    "we carefully compared the two lengths and found that both lengths are completely equivalent and show the same qualitative features .",
    "a vertical length can be obtained from the vertical extent of these clusters .",
    "two - times quantities have been shown in many studies to be very valuable when investigating the non - equilibrium properties of systems relaxing to a steady state @xcite .",
    "the two - times autocorrelation function @xmath29 compares the configurations at the waiting time @xmath30 with that at the observation time @xmath31 .",
    "important insights can also often be obtained from two - times response functions . for the model discussed here the only control parameter that can be used to perturb",
    "the system is the swapping rate @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we use as our perturbation a sudden global change of @xmath32 from some initial value @xmath33 to some final value @xmath34 at time @xmath30 after preparing the system . for times",
    "@xmath31 we then monitor how the system relaxes to the final steady state by measuring the time - dependent horizontal length @xmath35 of the perturbed system .",
    "of particular interest is the difference @xcite @xmath36 between the length measured in the perturbed system and that measured in the system where @xmath37 at all times .",
    "all the quantities mentioned up to now do not provide direct information on the behavior of individual particles . in order to probe the system at this more microscopic level , we tag individual particles and follow their motion . from the resulting individual trajectories we determine the displacement of each particle from its initial position as a function of time . in the two - dimensional system particles of course move in both dimensions , but the vertical motion is rather trivial as exchanges between neighboring particles of different types always take place .",
    "for that reason we only discuss the mean displacement of the particles in the horizontal direction : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the horizontal coordinate of the position vector @xmath40 of particle @xmath41 at time @xmath42 , whereas @xmath43 is the horizontal coordinate of the position of the same particle in the initial configuration .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in two space dimensions we can extract both a horizontal and a vertical length .",
    "due to the anisotropy of the system , these lengths are not identical . in order to directly compare with the one - dimensional @xmath0 model , we mostly focus in the following on the length in the horizontal direction .",

    "[ fig1]a and @xmath45 in fig .",
    "the value @xmath44 is close to the value @xmath10 for unbiased exchanges .",
    "this closeness to @xmath10 gives raise to a very slow initial onset of the ordering process , and it takes for a system composed of 10 or more lines around 2000 time steps before a growth in @xmath24 can be observed .",
    "this is different for the case of strong bias , @xmath45 , where ordering emerges already after less than 100 time steps .",
    "once ordering sets in for @xmath44 , it rapidly yields the formation of ordered stripes ( see the configurations in fig .",

    "interestingly , for systems with a larger vertical extent ( see the data for the @xmath47 system in fig .",

    "in the early stages of the ordering process , clusters merge and grow in vertical direction until they reach from bottom to top .",
