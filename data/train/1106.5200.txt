    "<S> in general the calculation of a ( high - dimensional ) phase diagram of a multi - component system is a daunting task @xcite . in this case , however , it is justified to ignore fractionation ( see appendix c ) , which reduces the problem to minimizing the functional with respect to @xmath89 at fixed @xmath90 . </S>",

    "<S> this topology change is due to the appearance of landau tetracritical points , which in turn is related to a competition between the prolate `` rod - like '' ordering typical of the pure components and the oblate `` plate - like '' purely induced by the mixing . in combination with the destabilization of the @xmath54 phase , we can conclude that polydispersity dramatically increases the stability regime of the @xmath0 phase . </S>",
    "<S> the usual stability limitations of @xmath0 phases , such as @xmath67 demixing of rod - plate mixtures and ordering into smectics , are therefore overcome in the present system . although this work focuses on a particular value of the particles dimensions , its predictions hold for a more general choice of the relevant parameters , as reported in fig . </S>",
