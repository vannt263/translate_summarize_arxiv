    "beyond its natural manifestations in various mechanical systems @xcite , the commonly known newton - cradle ( nc ) setup ( which was actually first built , as an experimental device , by french physicist edme mariotte in 1670 @xcite ) has found microscopic realizations in atomic and molecular chains @xcite .",
    "another physically interesting possibility is to build ncs as a chain of solitons or wave pulses , if they may be considered as repulsively interacting quasiparticles .",
    "this option was elaborated in detail in terms of an immiscible binary bose - einstein condensate , assuming that the chain is built as a string of alternating solitons composed of mutually repelling components , while the intrinsic nonlinearity of each component is self - attractive @xcite .",
    "still earlier , a similar system was studied experimentally and theoretically in the form of supersolitons \" in a chain of magnetic - flux quanta ( fluxons ) pinned to a lattice of defects in a long josephson junction @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was reported that a finite chain of _ dissipative solitons _ in a two - dimensional model of the laser cavity , with a built - in spatially periodic grating , may also feature an nc dynamical regime , if the trapped chain is initially hit by a moving soliton @xcite .",
    "characteristic features of the nc phenomenology are clearly observed in that setting , even if the underlying dynamics is dissipative , being governed by a complex ginzburg - landau equation .    in the present work we aim to present a realization of the nc in nonlinear optical fibers , where the cradle \" , in the form of a non - uniform train of quasi - solitons , is naturally produced as a result of the fission of @xmath0-solitons under the action of the third - order dispersion ( tod ) .",
    "the process of higher - order soliton fission is , by itself , of great significance to applications ( see below ) .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the realization of the nc array in this setting is vastly different from the classical chain of identical hard beads : the constituent solitons have different sizes , and they interact inelastically , exchanging energy and emitting considerable amounts of radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the overall dynamical scenario may be identified as that characteristic to nc systems : the uttermost soliton starts the motion from the left edge of the array , which triggers a localized wave of the energy and momentum transfer across the array , ending up with the release of one or several free solitons from the right edge , while the other solitons stay in the form of a bound chain .",
    "in fact , these results suggest that the nc concept is not restricted to the mechanical realizations , and may be extended to more general settings .",
    "in fact , an essential extension suggested by the present results is that colliding quasi - particles may effectively _ pass through each other _ in the ncs based on soliton arrays .",
    "it is well known that , in addition to the ubiquitous fundamental solitons , the integrable nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation and physical systems described by nearly - integrable versions of this equation kivsharmalomed support @xmath0-soliton states , with @xmath1 , which are oscillating modes periodically restoring their shape at distances that are multiples of the fundamental soliton period @xcite .",
    "although they are subject to a weak splitting instability , due to the fact that their binding energy is equal to zero , in the case of the integrable equation ( the splitting may be catalyzed by a weak resonant periodic modulation of the nonlinearity strength @xcite ) , higher - order solitons were observed in nonlinear optical fibers @xcite , and robust @xmath2-solitons have been created as basic modes in soliton lasers @xcite .",
    "recently , dynamics of higher - order solitons was studied theoretically in regular and parity - time - symmetric nonlinear dual - core couplers @xcite .",
    "the fission of @xmath0-solitons in nonlinear optical fibers is naturally caused by higher - order linear and nonlinear effects @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , such as the raman - induced self - frequency shift @xcite,@xcite , self - steepening blow , and third - order dispersion ( tod ) , which are included into the corresponding generalized nls equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the point at which the fission occurs is , usually , the one where the bandwidth of the evolving @xmath0-soliton attains its maximum . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath0-soliton in its unperturbed form can be naturally used for strong compression of the pulse ( the so - called soliton - compression effect ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the fission of higher - order solitons is a key enabling mechanism for the generation of ultrashort frequency - tuned fundamental solitons @xcite , and for the creation of ultra - broadband supercontinuum @xcite .",
    "recent advances in manufacturing photonic - crystal fibers filled with raman - inactive gases @xcite provide an additional motivation to focus the studies on the tod - induced fission and its potential applications to photonics , in the absence of the raman effect .    in earlier works , it was demonstrated that higher - order terms , treated as small perturbations , split @xmath0-solitons into a set of @xmath0 different fundamental solitons , with the sequence of peak powers analytically predicted by the well - known exact solution of satsuma and yajima , see eq .",
    "( [ sy ] ) below @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , we demonstrate below that , when the input pulse is injected close to the zero - dispersion point , hence the tod effect is relatively strong , such a simple picture of the soliton fission is far from reality and a detailed numerical study is required .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii , which is followed by the presentation of the main numerical results in section iii . as mentioned above ,",
    "the results demonstrate that the fission of @xmath0-solitons under the action of the tod proceeds via the creation of ncs in the form of nonuniform soliton chains , and passage of one or several tallest solitons across the entire chain , ending by release of the passing solitons , while the remaining ones stay in the form of bound array .",
    "an essential difference of the nc dynamical regime in the soliton arrays from the nc in chains of mechanical particles is that collisions of solitons are partly inelastic , in the nonintegrable system . as a result ,",
    "the passing soliton collects additional energy and momentum from the other pulses , and is eventually released from the array with a considerable increase of the energy , and with a large frequency shift . to demonstrate the relevance of the generalized nc concept in the broader context of nonlinear optics , in section iv we demonstrate the realization of",
    "the tod - driven nc in periodic patterns of wave pulses , such as prefabricated \" chains of identical solitons .",
    "the paper is concluded by section iv .",
    "the dynamics of ultrashort pulses in nonlinear fibers is governed by the generalized nls equation for amplitude @xmath3 of the electromagnetic field , which includes the tod , self - steepening , and raman terms agrawal , dudleyobzor : @xmath4 ,   \\label{nls}\\end{gathered}\\]]where , as usual , @xmath5 and and @xmath6 are the propagation distance and reduced time @xcite , and @xmath7 is the @xmath8th - order dispersion coefficient at carrier frequency @xmath9 . the fiber loss is neglected in eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) , as the fission of the @xmath0-soliton and formation of the nc occur on the propagation - distance scale which is much shorter than the absorption length .",
    "further , the nonlinearity coefficient is taken as @xmath10 w@xmath11m@xmath11 , the response function is @xmath12 , with the first and second terms standing for the instantaneous and delayed ( raman ) contributions , respectively . here",
    "@xmath13 is the fraction of the raman contribution to the nonlinear polarization , and @xmath14 approximates the raman response function of the silica fiber @xcite , with @xmath15 fs and @xmath16 fs .",
    "hereafter , the second - order group - velocity - dispersion ( gvd ) coefficient is taken as @xmath17 ps@xmath18/m , with the pulse injected at carrier wavelength @xmath19 nm into the anomalous - gvd region of the fiber , close to the zero - dispersion point ( zdp ) .",
    "equation ( [ nls ] ) was solved numerically by means of the split - step fourier method @xcite .",
    "actually , the simulations of the @xmath0-soliton fission included the raman effect and the shock term only at the last stage of the analysis , the results of which are displayed below in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] to show that these terms are not crucially important for the nc  dynamics , unlike the tod .",
    "higher - order - dispersion terms , up to the seventh order , are also included in simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as mentioned above ,",
    "neglecting the raman self - frequency shift is relevant , in particular , for the pulse propagation in holey fibers filled by raman - inactive gases @xcite , where the effective raman coefficient is 4 or 5 orders of magnitude smaller than in silica .",
    "simulations of eq . ( [ nls ] ) were performed with the input in the form of the usual @xmath0-soliton,@xmath20with @xmath21 , and by setting @xmath22 fs ( the respective fwhm width is @xmath23 fs ) . with the above - mentioned value of the second - order gvd coefficient @xmath24 @xmath25 ps@xmath18/m ,",
    "the peak power of the fundamental soliton corresponding to this width is @xmath26 w. while the second - order dispersion parameter is kept constant , its third - order counterpart ( the tod coefficient ) will be varied . in the case of weak tod ,",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0-soliton splitting , based on the perturbation theory , was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , for larger values of @xmath27 , the dynamics is more complex , strongly deviating from the prediction of the perturbative analysis ( see fig .",
    "fig4 below ) .",
    "the tod distorts the fundamental pulse , making it asymmetric , with a periodic oscillatory structure emerging near one edge @xcite , which results from dispersive waves and is described by the airy function @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the shape of the soliton experiences a strong deformation with the appearance of this oscillating structure at the front or rear side of the soliton @xcite , depending on the sign of @xmath28 . here",
    "we consider the case of opposite signs of the tod and second - order gvd ( for identical signs , the results can be obtained by substitution @xmath29 , which reverses the sign of @xmath27 ) .    despite the fact that the energy coupled into the radiation under the action of tod is relatively small",
    ", it was demonstrated that the dispersive wave carries away a significant amount of momentum @xcite .",
    "the periodic light structure at the edge of the pulse induces effective refractive index change , that attracts the main peak of the pulse .",
    "if more energy is injected into the fiber than it is required for the formation of the fundamental soliton , the interaction between the oscillatory structure and the peak of the pulse becomes stronger , causing acceleration or delay of the pulse .",

    "the first - born tallest soliton starts to advance from the left edge of the wavetrain to the right under the action of the strong tod , consecutively colliding with all the other peaks in the emerging chain .",
    "phase shifts @xmath33 between adjacent peaks were measured to range in the interval of @xmath34 making the collisions between individual pulses repulsive @xcite .",
    "the colliding pulses exchange the energy and momentum before the soliton is ejected from the pulse array , carrying extra energy and featuring a frequency shift ( i.e. , carrying extra momentum ) , which were accumulated due to non - elasticity of collisions under the action of tod @xcite .",

    "another relevant example is provided by recent works which simulated the splitting of a broad input into soliton arrays in models with the quadratic ( second - harmonic - generating nonlinearity ) @xcite : in some cases , they display the release of cherenkov wave packets , which resemble the ejection of the free soliton form the nc soliton array , which was reported above .",
    "we have introduced the optical analog of the nc ( newton s cradle ) in the form of soliton arrays , or chains of optical pulses . the characteristic feature of the nc , i.e. , the transmission of a narrow wave of collisions , which is realized as the passage of the tallest soliton through the whole array , from left to right , is driven by the tod , and ends by release of the tallest soliton , with a conspicuous frequency shift .",
    "due to inelasticity of soliton collisions under the action of tod , the passing soliton collects energy in the course of its motion through the array .",
    "we have demonstrated that the nc , built of optical pulses with different amplitudes , is naturally generated by the tod - driven fission of @xmath0-solitons .",
    "similar nc dynamical regimes are induced as well by the tod acting on arrays of identical solitons .",

    "along with multiple dispersive waves emitted the ejected solitons generate a broadband supercontinuum .",
    "the nc - forming mechanism is robust against the inclusion of the raman and self - steepening effects , as well as dispersion terms of order higher than three .",
    "while the similarity of the dynamical regimes reported above to the classical mechanical nc is far from being exact , the features demonstrated by the arrays of solitons , suggest that the original nc concept may be extended for nonlinear - wave settings , acquiring new properties : the soliton arrays building the nc as a result of the fission of @xmath0-soliton input are naturally non - uniform , and the tallest soliton , moving across the array , effectively passes through other solitons , which is possible for quasi - particles , but impossible for hard beads in the mechanical nc .",
    "furthermore , the passing soliton collects the energy and momentum from other solitons , and is eventually released along with conspicuous amounts of radiation , which lends the nc dynamics in soliton arrays novel inelastic features .",
    "the dynamical regimes that proceed via the formation of the soliton ncs may find important applications in optics , such as optimization of the supercontinuum generation .",
    "it is expected that soliton - based ncs may also be constructed in other models of nonlinear optics , such as chains of gap solitons in bragg gratings or photonic crystals . in particular , the breakup of higher - order spatial solitons under the action of nonlinear absorption , demonstrated in ref .",

    "<S> a mechanism for creating a newton s cradle ( nc ) in nonlinear light wavetrains under the action of the third - order dispersion ( tod ) is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of the nc structure plays an important role in the process of fission of higher - order ( @xmath0- ) solitons in optical fibers . </S>",
    "<S> after the splitting of the initial @xmath0-soliton into a nonuniform chain of fundamental quasi - solitons , the tallest one travels along the entire chain , through consecutive collisions with other solitons , and then escapes , while the remaining chain of pulses stays as a bound state , due to the radiation - mediated interaction between them . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the initial soliton s order , @xmath0 , leads to the transmission through , and release of additional solitons with enhanced power , along with the emission of radiation , which may demonstrate a broadband supercontinuum spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the nc dynamical regime remains robust in the presence of extra perturbations , such as the raman and self - steepening effects , and dispersions terms above the third order . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that essentially the same nc mechanism is induced by the tod in finite segments of periodic wavetrains ( in particular , soliton chains ) . </S>",
    "<S> a strong difference from the mechanical nc is that the tod - driven pulse passing through the soliton array collects energy and momentum from other solitons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , uniform and non - uniforms arrays of nonlinear wave pulses offer an essential extension of the mechanical nc , in which the quasi - particles , unlike mechanical beads , interact inelastically , exchanging energy and generating radiation . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the characteristic phenomenology of nc chains may be clearly identified in these nonlinear - wave settings too . </S>"
