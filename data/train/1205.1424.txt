    "quantum communication is poised to be the first real - world application of quantum information theory .",
    "impressive efforts are underway to build advanced quantum devices , such as quantum channels @xcite , quantum memories @xcite , and quantum key distribution systems @xcite , which will make long - distance quantum communication a reality .",
    "but our control over the quantum world is still imperfect ; it is difficult to create devices whose operation faithfully matches the ideal . internal flaws and external influences",
    "can negatively impact a device s operation . since quantum effects",
    "are very fragile , there is little tolerance for such deficiencies .",
    "fortunately , it is still possible for imperfect devices to facilitate quantum communication .",
    "the task of _ quantum benchmarking _ is to certify a device to be within the `` quantum domain , '' the operational regime where an imperfect device is still useful for quantum communication . in practice , this is done by preparing some test states , probing the device in question with these states , and making measurements on the resulting output states .",
    "the corresponding theoretical task is to calculate the threshold ( according to some figure(s ) of merit ) between a quantum device and the best comparible classical device .",
    "if we can conclude , based on the available information , that the device s performance beats the benchmark value , then the device is in the quantum domain .",
    "of course , there is some interplay between the two sides , especially in the choice of test states .",
    "a number of benchmarks have been developed in recent years , especially for continuous variable ( cv ) encodings of light @xcite .",
    "many of these benchmarks require test states which are pure and/or gaussian .",
    "such states are much more amenable to theoretical analysis than more general states of light .",
    "now , if we recognize that our quantum communication devices are imperfect , we must also recognize that our state preparations may be imperfect as well ( e.g. , due to excess noise or other flaws in the preparation procedure ) .",
    "this leads to discrepencies between the idealized benchmarking situation and the experimental realization . using state tomography or some other process to obtain numerical descriptions of the prepared states",
    ", we may find that these states are not consistent with the ideal form ( e.g. , not pure or not gaussian ) . in this case , is it valid to apply benchmarks which assume the ideal form ?",
    "furthermore , many of the above benchmarks require an infinite ensemble of test states . what conclusions can be made when using a finite ensemble ( as we must always do in practice ) if the benchmark requires an infinite ensemble ?",
    "addressing these practical concerns is an important part of quantum benchmarking .    in this work",
    ", we present a general benchmarking framework which is easily adaptable to different testing conditions .",
    "in particular , our framework allows for quantum benchmarking using arbitrary states , not just states with a special form .",
    "previous progress has been made toward this goal using _ entanglement - based _ benchmarks , but these schemes are still limited to special cases : either the test ensemble contains only pure states @xcite , or it consists of only two mixed states @xcite ( in either case , the states are not required to be gaussian ) .",
    "we extend these results to any finite number of mixed states , allowing us to derive quantum benchmarks for arbitrary finite ensembles of test states .",
    "there is some freedom allowed by this extension , and we outline how to strengthen benchmarks to give the largest quantum domain , i.e. , the best chance of certifying imperfect quantum devices .",
    "we then apply our benchmarking criterion to an actual continuous - variable memory .",
    "the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows . in sec . [",
    "sec : benchmarking ] we outline the necessary theory .",
    "we show how to generalize previous results to an arbitrary number of test states and how to optimize this generalization . as an application",
    ", we consider phase - symmetric test ensembles , and derive a simple standard form for the bipartite matrices used to represent such ensembles in entanglement - based benchmarking . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmemtest ] , we test our general benchmarking method using data from a real continuous - variable memory . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we make some concluding observations .",
    "we picture any potential quantum communication device as a channel which takes quantum states as input and gives quantum states as output .",
    "the distinction between quantum and classical communication devices is that classical devices are equivalent to _ measure and prepare _ ( mp ) channels . in these channels ,",
    "the input state is measured , the measurement outcome is communicated or stored in a solely classical manner , and an output state is prepared based on this classical data . any device that is equivalent to a mp channel is not a true quantum communication device , since communication through mp channels is equivalent to classical communication .",
    "it is often convenient to picture benchmarking in an adversarial way . in this scenario",
    ", we allow the possibility that a quantum device could have been replaced by a mp channel trying to pass our quantum benchmarking tests . only by conclusively ruling out mp operation can we certify a quantum device as genuine .",
    "devices which can be discriminated from classical channels are said to be in the quantum domain .    in practice , we probe the device with a finite number of different test states @xmath0 and make measurements on the resulting output states . from the measurement results and knowledge of the test ensemble , we must determine whether the device is in the quantum domain or whether the same operation could be performed by a classical channel . with enough test states and measurements , we can characterize a device exactly , i.e. , perform process tomography , allowing a device s performance to be tested against any theoretical benchmark @xcite . however , process tomography can be resource intensive , especially for cv systems .",
    "our goal will be to certify quantum devices with minimal requirements .",
    "if a given benchmarking test fails , it may still be possible to certify a quantum device by incorporating more test states and/or more measurements .",
    "there are a number of approaches for determining whether a device is in the quantum domain .",
    "typically , some specific operational or theoretical quantities are chosen and the corresponding quantum domain is mapped out by determining the limits of classical devices .",
    "one such example is the state - independent @xmath1-@xmath2 benchmark based on signal - transfer and conditional - variance @xcite , parameters which capture how well a signal is preserved and how much extra noise is introduced by the device .",
    "another much - studied figure of merit is the average fidelity between the test states and the corresponding output states after the device action ( represented by the map @xmath3 ) : @xmath4),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are some fixed weights .",
    "if the test states are not perfectly distinguishable , a mp channel can not achieve perfect fidelity .",
    "indeed , for a given test ensemble , there is some maximum average fidelity @xmath6 which is achievable by mp channels .",
    "a device must beat this benchmark value , @xmath7 , to be in the quantum domain .",
    "this approach requires us to compute the optimal value @xmath6 and to calculate or bound the experimentally - achieved value @xmath8 .",
    "typically , finding the experimental fidelity requires tomography on the output states .",
    "as well , tomography on the prepared states is needed to ensure that they match the required form .",
    "a number of fidelity - based benchmarks have been derived for cv test states , including coherent states , squeezed states , and thermalized states @xcite .",
    "other benchmarks use the same approach but slightly different figures of merit @xcite or models for classical channels @xcite .",
    "many of these benchmarks require test ensembles with an infinite number of states , although fidelity benchmarks for any two pure states have also been calculated @xcite .",
    "the classical threshold @xmath6 is often very difficult to determine , making the fidelity - based approach hard to generalize to arbitrary test ensembles .",
    "this limits the applicability of this method to those ensembles where a benchmark value has been found , and we must verify that the experimentally - prepared states match the ideal form . as well , without ( costly ) tomography on the output states , or extra assumptions , it can be difficult to properly determine the experimental fidelity value @xmath8 .",
    "there is another approach to quantum benchmarking @xcite which avoids many of these problems .",
    "this approach is based on the following important property : mp channels always break entanglement .",
    "in fact , the set of mp channels is equivalent to the set of entanglement - breaking channels @xcite . by showing that a device preserves entanglement",
    ", we can exclude it from the mp class . to accomplish this goal , a bipartite entangled state , built from the test states ,",
    "is considered . for the moment",
    ", we will focus on pure test states @xmath9 , and we will generalize to mixed states in the next subsection .",
    "we imagine the test states are coupled with an ancillary system , giving the following entangled state @xmath10 here , alice s states lie in an @xmath11dimensional hilbert space for which @xmath12 forms an orthonormal basis .",
    "we let the device in question act on the @xmath13 subsystem of this entangled state , mapping it to some output system @xmath14 , while subsystem @xmath15 is kept isolated .",
    "the reduced state @xmath16 remains the same , independent of the channel : @xmath17 aside from a fixed prefactor , the density matrix @xmath16 is the gram matrix ( matrix of overlaps ) for the pure test states @xmath18 .",
    "this structure will be important when we generalize to arbitrary states in the next subsection .    performing the local projective measurements @xmath19 on @xmath20",
    "effectively prepares the test states @xmath21 at random . after passing through the channel ,",
    "the output states @xmath22 ( on the system @xmath14 ) , are measured with some fixed set of measurements @xmath23 .",
    "using only these measurement results and knowledge of the gram matrix @xmath16 , we aim to determine whether the state @xmath24 { \\left\\vert{\\psi^\\text{ent}}\\right\\rangle { { \\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}\\left\\langle{\\psi^\\text{ent}}\\right\\vert}_{aa'}$ ] is entangled",
    ".    one method to certify entanglement is with a witnessing procedure @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it can be useful not only to qualify entanglement , but also to quantify it .",
    "an alternative approach to entanglement - based benchmarking @xcite is therefore to bound the entanglement of the final state away from zero using some suitable entanglement measure @xmath25 , i.e. , to show @xmath26 .",
    "one advantage of the quantitative method is that it can be used to compare different devices or situations which fall in the quantum domain .",
    "when we demonstrate our benchmarking method in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmemtest ] , we will take the quantitative approach , using tools from @xcite .",
    "the measurements on system @xmath15 are restricted to the projections @xmath27 . performing more general measurements on system @xmath15",
    "would prepare superpositions of the test states .",
    "but these superposition states can simply be included in the test ensemble , offering the same formalism with a slightly different entangled state for eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicentstate ] ) .",
    "this source replacement scheme allows us to work with the test states in practice and consider the entangled state @xmath28 as a virtual construct .",
    "the gram matrix @xmath16 provides the theoretical link between the test states and the virtual entangled state .",
    "finally , the gram matrix compactly contains all information about the pure test states which is needed for the given benchmarking procedure .",
    "a full description of the test ensemble is not strictly necessary .",
    "of course , we require some method for determining the overlap information .",
    "state tomography is one way to obtain this , but there may be other less costly ways to constrain the gram matrix .",
    "similarly , we do not require tomography on the output states for entanglement - based benchmarking .",
    "indeed , previous papers have demonstrated that useful quantum benchmarks can be found by measuring only two conjugate quadratures @xcite .",
    "thus , entanglement - based benchmarking can be very practical from an experimental point of view .",
    "how can the entangled state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicentstate ] ) be extended to the case where the test states @xmath29 are mixed ?",
    "some progress was made in this direction in @xcite , restricting to the case of only two test states . among several potential ways to generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicentstate ] ) , it was found that using purifications of the test states was the most useful . in this framework",
    ", we imagine that instead of preparing the test states , we prepare purifications @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is some purifying system , i.e. , @xmath32 from now on , @xmath33 will always refer to a purification of @xmath34 .",
    "to clarify , the experimental procedure ( using the test states @xmath35 ) remains the same .",
    "theoretically , the benchmarking procedure is analyzed as if the purifications @xmath36 were used instead , i.e. , the device is allowed to act on the larger system @xmath37 .",
    "measurements are still restricted to the @xmath14 subsystem , and the only information we retain about the purifications for the final benchmarking are the overlaps @xmath38 . in this way , we give extra power to an adversarial mp device , since the purifications may be more easily distinguished than the test states .",
    "although this modification may result in a slightly smaller quantum domain , any benchmarks based on the purifications are valid .",
    "now , even though we give extra power to an adversarial device , we should still aim to make our quantum benchmarks as stringent as we can , i.e. , to keep the quantum domain as large as possible .",
    "@xcite offers one method to limit the adversarial advantage provided by purifications , but this introduces additional numerical complexity , and we will not consider it in the present paper .",
    "however , there still remains some freedom in the actual choice of purifications , which we can use to strengthen our benchmarking scheme .",
    "for two mixed test states @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the virtual entangled state takes the form @xmath41 purifications are not unique , but we must fix some choice to proceed further . since we only retain information about the overlap @xmath42 , it is important to know the range of allowed values for this parameter",
    ". we can always find purifications which are orthogonal .",
    "on the other hand , from uhlmann s theorem @xcite , we have @xmath43 ^ 2=:f(\\rho_0,\\rho_1),\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the fidelity between the two test states .",
    "thus , the range of allowed overlaps is @xmath45 $ ] . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that the best benchmarks ( i.e. , those which give the best opportunity to certify devices in the quantum domain ) come from purifications which saturate the uhlmann fidelity bound . there was numerical support for this claim , but one can also appeal to the fact that the fidelity is a measure of ( in)distinguishability .",
    "accordingly , choosing purifications which are as indistinguishable as possible will make it harder for a mp channel to simulate a quantum channel reliably .",
    "we will make this intuition more precise in the following pages .",
    "finally , we note that uhlmann s theorem has also been suggested for fidelity - based benchmarking using two mixed states @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the entangled state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twomixed_entstate ] ) to accomodate @xmath46 mixed states .",
    "specifically , we will use @xmath47 the reduced density matrix @xmath48 is now ( aside from the prefactor ) the gram matrix of the purifications @xmath49 : @xmath50 it is _ not _ straightforward how to choose purifications in this case .",
    "the fidelity is a useful measure for two states , but there is no clear extension of the concept for multiple states .",
    "indeed , the set of allowed values for the overlaps @xmath38 has a more subtle structure than just a product of the ranges allowed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelbound ] ) .",
    "it may not be possible to choose purifications which achieve the fidelity bound for all pairs . in order to determine the best choice of purifications",
    ", we will examine the structure of entanglement - based benchmarking at a deeper level .",
    "how can we choose purifications to optimize the strength of entanglement - based benchmarks based on multiple mixed test states ? to begin answering this , we make the following observation .    _ proposition 1 .",
    "_ let @xmath49 and @xmath51 be two different sets of purifications of the test states @xmath29 .",
    "assume that there is a completely positive , trace - preserving ( cptp ) map which transforms one set of purifications to the other , i.e. , there exists @xmath52 such that @xmath53={\\left\\vert{\\delta_k}\\right\\rangle { { \\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}\\left\\langle{\\delta_k}\\right\\vert}\\ ] ] for all @xmath54 .",
    "if we can not conclude that a device is in the quantum domain with information based on the @xmath55 , then we can not conclude that the same device is in the quantum domain using information about the @xmath56 .",
    "_ represent the device under investigation by the map @xmath3 .",
    "this map takes in states on the joint @xmath37 system and outputs states on the @xmath14 system .",
    "we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we assume that we can perform tomographically complete measurements on the output states .",
    "later we will relax this to incomplete measurements . in either case , we work under the constraint that , for all @xmath54 , @xmath57=\\lambda\\big[{\\left\\vert{\\gamma_k}\\right\\rangle { { \\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}{{\\hspace{-0.1 em}}}\\left\\langle{\\gamma_k}\\right\\vert}\\big]=\\rho_k^\\text{out},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the output state corresponding to the test state @xmath34 .",
    "this constraint is experimentally enforced , since the output states are independent of the purification we use to theoretically describe the protocol .",

    "a benchmarking protocol is unsuccessful when we can not discriminate between the device and a mp channel , i.e. , when there is a mp channel which gives the same output states as the device .",
    "assume then that there exists an mp channel @xmath59 such that @xmath60=\\rho_k^\\text{out}\\ ] ] for all @xmath54 .",
    "now consider the alternate situation where we use the purifications @xmath56 , and there exists a cptp map @xmath52 as in eq .",

    "we define another channel @xmath61 by @xmath62 the concatenation of any channel with a mp channel is as a mp channel , so @xmath61 is in the mp class . from eqs .",

    "@xmath68    this proposition has some important consequences . for one , it tells us that in the source - replacement scheme we are using",
    ", the quantity of entanglement does not have a direct significance @xcite .",
    "instead , the focus should be to find those purifications which can not be collectively transformed , via cptp maps , to any other valid set .",
    "benchmarking schemes built with such purifications provide the hardest challenge for an adversarial mp device attempting to mimic a true quantum device .",
    "indeed , such limiting purifications necessarily lead to a larger quantum domain than any other comparable choice . because we only use the overlaps for benchmarking",
    ", we can optimize the cptp map condition on the level of gram matrices . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will use the terms ` purifications ' and ` gram matrix ( of the purifications ) ' somewhat interchangeably .",
    "the following theorem will help us translate the cptp map condition to a more amenable form .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be two sets of pure states ( they do not need to be purifications ) .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be the corresponding gram matrices , with elements @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "there exists a cptp map @xmath52 taking the former states to the latter if and only if the gram matrices are related by @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the hadamard ( or schur or entrywise ) product .",
    "the matrix @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 and its diagonal elements are given by @xmath79 .    to avoid potential confusion ,",
    "we point out that while the cptp map @xmath52 takes the @xmath80 to the @xmath81 , the gram matrix condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : grammatrixcondition ] ) , has the opposite sense , i.e. , @xmath71 is obtained by doing a particular operation on @xmath72 . since some of the matrix elements of @xmath77 could be zero , we can not invert the equation to give @xmath72 as a function of @xmath71 , so we leave the relation in this form",
    ". we also point out a corollary to this theorem : all compatible purifications of the test states @xmath35 can be prepared by applying a cptp map to a set of purifications which are orthogonal . therefore",
    ", orthogonal purifications can be seen as generators for the rest of the set of purifications .",
    "of course , we are interested in the other end of this generation , i.e. , the limiting sets of purifications .    given some ensemble of test states",
    ", it may be quite difficult to determine the best purifications analytically , especially for arbitrary test states .",
    "alternatively , we can attempt to find limiting purifications by maximizing some objective function @xmath82 , defined on ensembles of pure states ( or on the corresponding gram matrix ) , which preserves the order structure induced by cptp maps . in other words , if there exists a cptp map @xmath52 taking the pure states @xmath69 to the pure states @xmath70 , the desired function must satisfy @xmath83 when this property holds , the purifications which are limiting in the sense of cptp maps will maximize the objective function @xmath82 . before discussing candidates for the objective function , we point out one caveat .",
    "namely , the order structure imposed on the purifications by cptp maps is not a total order .",
    "accordingly , purifications which are not linked by a cptp map are not comparable .",
    "nevertheless , we can design quantum benchmarking schemes with any feasible set of purifications , and this heuristic provides a way to obtain strong candidates .",
    "a good candidate for the objective function is the _ gram matrix purity _",
    "@xmath84 ( recall from eq .",

    "therefore the gram matrix purity is monotonic with respect to cptp maps , as required .",
    "the gram matrix purity also has links to the distinguishability of the test states .",
    "for example , when working with only two test states @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the maximal value of @xmath84 is @xmath89 aside from a fixed affine transformation , the gram matrix purity is the fidelity between the test states . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the gram matrix purity defines a kind of averaged multi - state analog of the fidelity .",
    "finally , consider the state @xmath90 since a device has no information about which test state was prepared , this is the effective state input to the device in the purification picture .",
    "but since the virtual entangled state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmixed_entstate ] ) is pure , the spectra of the reduced states are equal , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath16 is of high purity , then so is the average test state @xmath92 . intuitively , when the average state @xmath92 is close to a pure state , its constituant test states @xmath93 will be difficult to distinguish .",
    "one drawback of the gram matrix purity is that it will be difficult to compute the maximum for @xmath46 , where we do not currently have an analytic formula like eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelbound ] ) . alternatively , since the objective function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : puritydef ] ) is convex and the set of compatible gram matrices is convex ( see appendix [ app : grammatconv ] ) , we could maximize this function numerically using the methods of convex optimization .",
    "although this presents one path towards our goal , we will not pursue it here .",
    "instead , the gram matrix purity helps us motivate a slightly different objective function which is easier to optimize numerically . to write this alternate function , we abbreviate the overlaps by @xmath94 and decompose them into real and imaginary parts : @xmath95 the alternate objective function",
    "is given by @xmath96    aside from a prefactor and duplicated terms , the main difference between @xmath97 and the gram matrix purity @xmath84 is that the squared modulus of the overlaps is replaced by a sum of the real and imaginary parts .",
    "the advantage of this objective function is that it is linear in the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 , allowing us to numerically optimize it using a semidefinite program , which can be done efficiently . in cases where the the imaginary parts @xmath99 vanish , then @xmath100 is a lower bound to the modulus @xmath101 .",
    "as well , when the objective function @xmath97 is large , the gram matrix purity will also be large , meaning we are close to a limiting gram matrix .",
    "the main drawback of this objective function is that it is not always monotonic .",
    "nevertheless , we remind the reader that _ any _ compatible gram matrix , including one found by an optimization process over @xmath97 , is valid for benchmarking purposes . indeed",
    ", we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmemtest ] that , despite being non - monotonic , this function leads to a gram matrix with near - optimal purity .",
    "before moving on , we pause to summarize the main results of this section . given some arbitrary ensemble of test states @xmath29 , we consider a virtual entangled state as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmixed_entstate ] ) , where the states @xmath30 are purifications of the test states .",
    "although the test states are used in practice , we benchmark a device by assuming that the device has access to the purifications .",
    "this framework provides more power to an adversarial device , but there is also some flexibility in the choice of purifications , which can be used to restrict the adversarial advantage .",
    "we showed that purifications which are extremal in the sense of cptp maps are better for benchmarking than all other comparable choices , so we should aim to build benchmarks using such purifications .",
    "we suggest finding good candidate purifications by optimizing some appropriate function which is monotonic with respect to cptp maps .",
    "we propose the gram matrix purity @xmath84 as a suitable candidate for this objective function , although it may be difficult to compute .",
    "we also propose a numerically simpler , though non - monotonic , objective function which may be used in place of the gram matrix purity .",
    "after the purifications have been chosen , the benchmarking proceeds as in the pure state case ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : benchbackground ] ) , requiring only the associated gram matrix .",
    "one useful application for the above results is in testing devices which are phase covariant .",
    "a device ( represented by @xmath3 ) is phase covariant when it commutes with unitary rotations of phase space , i.e. , @xmath102 = u_{\\phi}\\lambda[\\sigma ] u_{\\phi}^\\dagger~\\forall~\\sigma.\\ ] ] the rotation unitary is given by @xmath103 , with @xmath104 the standard number operator , so @xmath105 .",
    "we note that any channel can be made phase covariant by phase - randomization , @xmath106 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}u_{\\phi}\\lambda[u_{-\\phi}(~\\cdot~)u_{-\\phi}^\\dagger]u_{\\phi}^\\dagger d\\phi.\\ ] ] one way to accomplish this phase randomization is to use a drifting optical phase @xcite , a situation which is common in many continuous - variable setups . if the phase - randomized version of a channel passes a quantum benchmark , then the channel itself must be in the quantum domain as well . on the other hand , since @xmath107 involves a concatenation of channels , a phase - randomized channel may perform weaker against our benchmarks than the original channel .",
    "phase - covariant channels offer a number of advantages . on the experimental side",
    ", they can be benchmarked using only one physical test state .",
    "the effects of a phase - covariant channel on many other test states can be inferred by symmetry . on the theoretical side",
    ", phase covariance can lead to great numerical simplifications .",

    "as well , there is no experimental indication of phase sensitivity in the memory , i.e. , the observed loss and excess noise are uniform with respect to the angle in phase space .",
    "furthermore , there is no cross - talk between consecutive runs of the experiment .",
    "a data set contains measurements from 100,000 pulses stored in , and then recalled from , the memory .",
    "each pulse was separated in time by 0.1  ms which , given the decoherence rate of the atoms in the hot gas cell , means that each pulse was stored in a fresh ensemble of atoms .",
    "the experimental phase reference was allowed to drift freely between runs . in principle , this drift could be used to phase - randomize the device following the approach of @xcite , rendering the channel phase covariant . for the experimental data used in the present analysis , the observed drift was not fast enough to ensure the uniformly random distribution of phase angles required in eq .",

    "uniformity of the phase drift could be imposed by modifying the repetition rate of the experiment ( see sec .",

    "our goal here is to demonstrate the strength of our benchmarking approach under a variety of scenarios , by using data from a real memory .",
    "we therefore assume that running the experiment with a completely uniform phase drift would lead to the same data as obtained at the current repetition rate .",

    "nevertheless , the current scenario allows for a useful demonstratation of our benchmarking tools .      during an experimental run",
    ", light is generated from a continuous - wave master laser and split into a coupling field ( for activating the memory ) , a strong continuous - wave local oscillator , a weak signal pulse , and a memory - reference pulse .",
    "the memory - reference pulse is detuned from the active frequencies of the memory ( while maintaining a well - defined phase relation with the signal pulse ) , so that it passes through the memory without absorption .",
    "the signal pulse is sent to the memory shortly after the reference pulse such that the phase drift between the two pulses can be neglected .",
    "thus , we can obtain phase information for the input signal by determining the phase of the memory - reference pulse .",

    "data was collected using a 12-bit resolution data acquisition system .",

    "this phase angle is identified by fitting a sine wave to the memory - reference pulse .",
    "a quadrature value was assigned to each signal pulse after interference with the local oscillator by integrating the amplitude of the pulse over its duration .",

    "indeed , it is not until @xmath46 that the @xmath176 level conclusively leads to non - zero entanglement in the output state .",
    "another interesting result is that scenarios ( i ) and ( ii ) give very similar results for the entanglement when @xmath177 .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the output state has low levels of excess noise .",

    "finally , we note that all the results for the output state entanglement are lower bounds .",
    "if we were to use a real entangled state instead of a virtual one , we would have access to more information , and the output entanglement would be higher .",
