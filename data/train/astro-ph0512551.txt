    "the first pair of extrasolar planets suspected to be in mean - motion resonance was discovered around the star gj 876 , with the orbital periods nearly in the ratio 2:1 @xcite . a dynamical fit to the radial velocity data of gj 876 that accounts for the mutual gravitational interaction of the planets is essential because of the short orbital periods ( @xmath10 and 60 days ) and large planetary masses [ minimum combined planetary mass relative to the stellar mass @xmath11 .",
    "it is now well established that this pair of planets is deep in 2:1 orbital resonance , with both of the lowest order , eccentricity - type mean - motion resonance variables , @xmath12 and @xmath13 librating about @xmath14 with small amplitudes @xcite . here",
    "@xmath15 are the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planets , respectively , and @xmath16 are the longitudes of periapse .",
    "the simultaneous librations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 about @xmath14 mean that the secular apsidal resonance variable , @xmath17 also librates about @xmath14 and that the periapses are on average aligned .",
    "the basic dynamical properties of this resonant pair of planets are not affected by the recent discovery of a third , low - mass planet on a 1.9-day orbit in the gj 876 system @xcite .",
    "it is important to confirm other suspected resonant planetary systems , as the gj 876 system has shown that resonant planetary systems are interesting in terms of both their dynamics and their constraints on processes during planet formation .",
    "the geometry of the 2:1 resonances in the gj 876 system is different from that of the 2:1 resonances between the jovian satellites io and europa , where @xmath3 librates about @xmath14 but @xmath4 and @xmath18 librate about @xmath19 . for small orbital eccentricities ,",
    "the io - europa configuration is the only stable 2:1 resonance configuration with both @xmath3 and @xmath4 librating . for moderate to large eccentricities ,",
    "the io - europa configuration is not stable , but there is a wide variety of other stable 2:1 resonance configurations , including the gj 876 configuration @xcite .",
    "the resonances in the gj 876 system were most likely established by converging differential migration of the planets leading to capture into resonances , with the migration due to interaction with the protoplanetary disk . while it is easy to establish the observed resonance geometry of the gj 876 system by convergent migration , the observational upper limits on the eccentricities ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) require either significant eccentricity damping from planet - disk interaction or resonance capture occurring just before disk dispersal , because continued migration after resonance capture could lead to rapid growth of the eccentricities @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the assembly of the gj 876 resonances performed to date do not show significant eccentricity damping from planet - disk interaction and produce eccentricities that exceed the observational upper limits , unless the disk is dispersed shortly after resonance capture @xcite .",
    "hd 82943 was the second star discovered to host a pair of planets with orbital periods nearly in the ratio 2:1 .",
    "the discovery of the first planet was announced in eso press release 13/00 and the discovery of the second , inner planet was announced in eso press release 07/01 .",
    "@xcite have recently published the radial velocity measurements obtained with the coralie spectrograph on the 1.2-m euler swiss telescope at the eso la silla observatory in graphical form only .",
    "unlike gj 876 , a double - keplerian fit is likely adequate for hd 82943 , because the orbital periods are much longer ( @xmath22 and 440 days ) and the planetary masses are smaller [ minimum @xmath23 , and the mutual gravitational interaction of the planets is not expected to affect the radial velocity significantly over the few - year time span of the available observations . @xcite",
    "have found a best - fit double - keplerian solution , and its orbital parameters are reproduced in table [ tab : mayor ] .",
    "@xcite have reported simulations of the @xcite best - fit solution that are unstable , but they assumed that the orbital parameters are in astrocentric coordinates and they did not state the ranges of orbital inclinations and starting epochs examined .",
    "the fact that the orbital parameters obtained from multiple - keplerian fits should be interpreted as in jacobi coordinates was first pointed out by @xcite and was derived and demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we have performed direct numerical orbit integrations of the @xcite best - fit solution , assuming that the orbital parameters are in jacobi coordinates and that the orbits are coplanar with the same inclination @xmath24 from the plane of the sky .",
    "when we assumed that the orbital parameters correspond to the osculating parameters at the epoch jd 2451185.1 of the first coralie measurement , the system becomes unstable after a time ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 for @xmath6 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "since the long - term evolution can be sensitive to the epoch that the orbital parameters are assumed to correspond to , we have repeated the direct integrations by starting at three other epochs equally spaced between the first ( jd 2451185.1 ) and last ( jd 2452777.7 ) coralie measurements .",
    "all of the integrations become unstable , with the vast majority in less than @xmath30 . these results and those in (",
    "* who also examined mutually inclined orbits and the effects of the uncertainty in the stellar mass ) show that the best - fit solution found by @xcite is unstable .",
    "it is , however , essential that one examines not only the best - fit solution that minimizes the reduced chi - square statistic @xmath31 , but also fits with @xmath31 not significantly above the minimum , especially if the @xmath31 minimum is shallow and @xmath31 changes slowly with variations in one or more of the parameters .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the coralie data published in @xcite by generating a large number of orbital parameter sets and selecting those that fit the radial velocity data with the rms of the residuals ( instead of @xmath31 ) close to the minimum value .",
    "the stable coplanar fits that they have found have arguments of periapse @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and both @xmath3 and @xmath4 librate about @xmath14 with large amplitudes . in the resonance variables",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath18 ( eqs . [ [ theta1]][[thetasar ] ] ) can be measured from any reference direction in the orbital plane .",
    "if we choose the ascending node referenced to the plane of the sky as the reference direction , @xmath34 are the same as the arguments of periapse @xmath35 obtained from the radial velocity fit . ] on the other hand , @xcite have noted that it is possible to find an aligned configuration with @xmath36 that fits the data with nearly the same rms as their best - fit solution , although it is unclear whether such a fit would be stable and/or in 2:1 orbital resonance .",
    "thus , it has not been firmly established that the pair of planets around hd 82943 are in 2:1 orbital resonance , even though it is likely that a pair of planets of order jupiter mass so close to the 2:1 mean - motion commensurability would be dynamically unstable unless they are in 2:1 orbital resonance .    in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of the hd 82943 planetary system based on a radial velocity data set that combines new measurements obtained with the keck telescope and the coralie measurements published in graphical form .",
    "the stellar characteristics and the radial velocity measurements are described in  2 . in ",
    "3 we present the best - fit double - keplerian models on a grid of the poorly constrained eccentricity , @xmath37 , and argument of periapse , @xmath38 , of the outer planet s orbit . in ",
    "4 we use dynamical stability to narrow the range of reasonable fits and examine the dynamical properties of the stable fits .",
    "we show that the two planets in the hd 82943 system are almost certainly in 2:1 orbital resonance , with at least @xmath3 librating , and may even be consistent with small - amplitude librations of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized and discussed in  5 .",
    "the stellar characteristics of the g0 star hd 82943 were summarized in @xcite and @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have determined a stellar mass of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "@xcite have measured the metallicity of hd 82943 to be @xmath41 } = + 0.27 $ ] which , when combined with evolutionary models , gives a stellar mass of @xmath42 .",
    "we follow @xcite and adopt a mass of @xmath43 .",
    "stellar radial velocities exhibit intrinsic velocity `` jitter '' caused by acoustic p - modes , turbulent convection , star spots , and flows controlled by surface magnetic fields .",
    "the level of jitter depends on the age and activity level of the star @xcite . from the observed velocity variance of hundreds of stars with",
    "no detected companions in the california and carnegie planet search program , @xcite has developed an empirical model for predicting the jitter from a star s @xmath44 color , absolute magnitude , and chromospheric emission level .",
    "some of this empirically estimated `` jitter '' is no doubt actually instrumental , stemming from small errors in the data analysis at levels of 1@xmath45 . based on the model presented in @xcite",
    ", we estimate the jitter for hd 82943 to be @xmath46 , with an uncertainty of @xmath47 .",
    "we began radial velocity measurements for hd 82943 in 2001 with the hires echelle spectrograph on the keck i telescope .",
    "we have to date obtained 23 velocity measurements spanning @xmath48 , and they are listed in table [ tab : rv ] .",
    "the median of the internal velocity uncertainties is @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite have published 142 radial velocity measurements obtained between 1999 and 2003 in graphical form only .",
    "we have extracted their data from figure 6 of @xcite with an accuracy of about @xmath50d in the times of observation and an accuracy of about @xmath51 in the velocities and their internal uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath50d in the extracted time of observation can translate into a velocity uncertainty of as much as @xmath45 in the steepest parts of the radial velocity curve ( where the radial velocity can change by as much as @xmath52 per day ) , but the square of even this maximum ( @xmath45 ) is much smaller than the sum of the squares of the extracted internal uncertainty ( @xmath53 ) and the estimated stellar jitter ( @xmath46 ) . as another check of the quality of this extracted coralie data set , we have performed a double - keplerian fit of the extracted data , with the extracted internal uncertainties as the measurement errors in the calculation of the reduced chi - square statistic @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting best fit has rms @xmath54 , which is only slightly larger than the rms ( @xmath55 ) of the mayor et al .",
    "best fit , and the orbital parameters agree with those found by mayor et al . and reproduced in table [ tab : mayor ] to better than @xmath56 in the last digit .",
    "this confirms that the extracted data set is comparable in quality to the actual data set .    in the analysis below , we use the combined data set containing 165 velocity measurements and spanning @xmath57 , and we adopt the quadrature sum of the internal uncertainty and the estimated stellar jitter as the measurement error of each data point in the calculation of @xmath31 .",
    "as we mention in  1 , the mutual gravitational interaction of the planets is not expected to affect the radial velocity of hd 82943 significantly over the @xmath58-year time span ( or about 5 outer planet orbits ) of the available observations .",
    "thus we fit the radial velocity @xmath59 of the star with the reflex motion due to two orbiting planetary companions on independent keplerian orbits : @xmath60 +        k_2 \\left[\\cos(\\omega_2 + f_2 ) + e_2 \\cos\\omega_2\\right ] + v , \\label{rv}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the line - of - sight velocity of the center of mass of the whole planetary system relative to the solar system barycenter , @xmath62 is the amplitude of the velocity induced by the @xmath63th planet , and @xmath64 , @xmath35 and @xmath65 are , respectively , the eccentricity , argument of periapse , and true anomaly of the @xmath63th planet s orbit ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the zero points of the velocities measured by different telescopes are different , and @xmath61 is a parameter for each telescope ( denoted as @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the keck and coralie data , respectively )",
    ". since the true anomaly @xmath65 depends on @xmath64 , the orbital period @xmath68 , and the mean anomaly @xmath69 at a given epoch ( which we choose to be the epoch of the first coralie measurement , jd 2451185.1 ) , there are five parameters , @xmath68 , @xmath62 , @xmath64 , @xmath35 , and @xmath69 , for each keplerian orbit .",
    "thus there are a total of 12 parameters . the fact that the orbital parameters obtained from double - keplerian fits should be interpreted as jacobi ( and not astrocentric ) coordinates does not change the fitting function in equation ( [ rv ] ) but changes the conversion from @xmath62 and @xmath68 to the planetary masses @xmath70 and orbital semimajor axes @xmath71 : @xmath72 @xmath73^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "all of the orbital fits presented here are obtained using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite to minimize @xmath31 .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt algorithm is effective at converging on a local minimum for given initial values of the parameters .",
    "we begin by using the parameter values listed in table [ tab : mayor ] as the initial guess and allowing all 12 parameters to be varied in the fitting .",
    "the resulting fit i is listed in table [ tab : fits ] and compared to the radial velocity data in figure [ fig : irv ] .",
    "we also show the residuals of the radial velocity data from fit i in the top panel of figure [ fig : res ] .",
    "fit i has @xmath75 for 12 adjustable parameters ( or @xmath76 if we rescale @xmath31 to 10 adjustable parameters for comparison with the 10 parameter fits below ) and rms @xmath77",
    ". however , fit i is dynamically unstable if the orbits are assumed to be coplanar .",
    "we perform a series of direct numerical orbit integrations of fit i similar to that described in  1 to test the stability of the @xcite best - fit solution ( i.e. , with @xmath6 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and four starting epochs equally spaced between jd 2451185.1 and jd 2452777.7 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ievol ] shows the evolution of the semimajor axes , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and eccentricities , @xmath80 and @xmath37 , for the integration with @xmath6 and starting epoch jd 2451185.1 , which becomes unstable after @xmath81 .",
    "all of the integrations of fit i become unstable in time ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "we then explore fits in which one or two of the parameters are fixed at values different from those of fit i and the other parameters are varied .",
    "these experiments indicate that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the least constrained parameters , as there are fits with @xmath37 and @xmath38 fixed at values very different from those of fit i that have @xmath31 ( after taking into account the difference in the number of adjustable parameters ) and rms only slightly different from those of fit i. therefore , we decide to examine systematically best - fit double - keplerian models with fixed values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we start at @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( which are close to the values for fit i ) , using the parameters of fit i as the initial guess for the other 10 parameters .",
    "then for each point on a grid of resolution @xmath86 in @xmath37 and @xmath87 in @xmath38 , we search for the best fit with fixed @xmath37 and @xmath38 , using the best - fit parameters already determined for an adjacent grid point as the initial guess .",
    "figure [ fig : param ] shows the contours of @xmath31 , rms , @xmath80 , @xmath88 , and the planetary mass ratio @xmath89 for the best - fit double - keplerian models with fixed values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "fit i at @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the only minimum in @xmath31 , with @xmath92 for 10 adjustable parameters .",
    "however , the minimum is relatively shallow , with @xmath93 in a region that includes the entire region with @xmath94 and extends to @xmath95 near @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the contours of rms are similar to those of @xmath31 .",
    "the rms minimum ( where rms @xmath98 ) at @xmath84 and @xmath99 is only slightly offset from the @xmath31 minimum , and the region with @xmath93 also has rms @xmath100 .",

    "we can infer from the parameters listed in table [ tab : fits ] that the fits ii  iv have nearly identical @xmath78(@xmath108 ) , @xmath79(@xmath109 ) , and @xmath110(@xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the mass of jupiter ) while @xmath113 ranges from @xmath114 for fit ii to @xmath115 for fit iv .",
    "figure [ fig : res ] demonstrates visually that these fits with @xmath31 only slightly higher than the minimum are comparable in the quality of fit to the fit i with the minimum @xmath31 .",
    "we begin with some general remarks on the dynamical properties of the best - fit double - keplerian models with fixed @xmath37 and @xmath38 that can be inferred from the contour plots in figure [ fig : param ] .",
    "there is a wide variety of stable 2:1 resonance configurations with both @xmath3 and @xmath4 librating ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for @xmath116 , there are ( 1 ) the sequence of resonance configurations that can be reached by the differential migration of planets with constant masses and initially coplanar and nearly circular orbits , ( 2 ) the sequence with large @xmath37 and asymmetric librations of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 far from either @xmath14 or @xmath19 , and ( 3 ) the sequence with @xmath3 librating about @xmath19 and @xmath4 librating about @xmath14 . their loci in the @xmath80-@xmath37 plane are shown in figures 5 , 11 , and 14 , respectively , of @xcite .",
    "the good fits in figure [ fig : param ] have @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are far from the loci of the sequences 2 and 3 .",
    "thus the good fits in figure [ fig : param ] can not be small - libration - amplitude configurations in the sequences 2 and 3 .",
    "figure [ fig : param]_d _ shows that the fits with @xmath119 also have @xmath32 .",
    "these fits with @xmath120 currently also have @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and we can infer from figure 5 of @xcite for the sequence 1 that the fits with @xmath123 and @xmath124 could be in a symmetric configuration with both @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( and hence @xmath18 ) librating about @xmath14 with small amplitudes . however , direct numerical orbit integrations are needed to determine whether the fits with @xmath123 and @xmath125 are in fact in such a resonance configuration .",
    "finally , figure 5 of @xcite also shows that there are configurations in the sequence 1 with asymmetric librations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the region @xmath126 and @xmath118 if @xmath127 , and we can not rule out the possibility of asymmetric librations for the fits in figure [ fig : param ] with @xmath127 without direct numerical orbit integrations .    in order to use dynamical stability to narrow the range of reasonable fits and to determine the actual dynamical properties of the stable fits , we perform direct numerical orbit integrations of all of the best - fit double - keplerian models with fixed @xmath37 and @xmath38 shown in figure [ fig : param ] .",
    "we use the symplectic integrator symba @xcite and assume that the orbital parameters obtained from the fits are in jacobi coordinates ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "double - keplerian fits do not yield the inclinations of the orbits from the plane of the sky .",
    "we assume that the orbits are coplanar and consider two cases : @xmath128 and @xmath29 .",

    "our analysis differs from that of @xcite in having the additional keck data , in using @xmath31 instead of rms as the primary measure of the goodness of fit , and in examining systematically the dynamical properties of all of the fits found .",
    "although @xcite showed @xmath64 and @xmath35 of many fits with rms within @xmath179 of the minimum rms , they discussed in detail the dynamical properties of only two fits  their solutions a and b  with rms within @xmath180 of the minimum .",
    "their solutions a and b have @xmath32 and @xmath33 and hence large amplitude librations of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 . because the fit to the coralie data with the minimum rms ( which is near the minimum @xmath31 fit of @xcite at @xmath181 and @xmath182 ; see table [ tab : mayor ] )",
    "is close to the stability boundary in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane , @xcite were able to find stable fits with rms within @xmath180 of the minimum .",
    "for the combined data set , the fit with the minimum rms at @xmath183 and @xmath184 is far from the stability boundary , and none of our fits with rms within @xmath180 of the minimum are stable ( see figs . [",
    "fig : param]_b _ , [ fig:1.0]_a _ , and [ fig:0.5]_a _ ) .",
    "however , by examining systematically the @xmath31 , rms , and dynamical properties of all of our fits , we have found fits like fit iv ( which has stable , large amplitude libration of only @xmath3 if @xmath185 ) , fit iii ( which has large amplitude librations of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and , in particular , fit ii ( which has small amplitude librations of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , all with rms within @xmath186 of the minimum and @xmath31 within @xmath160 of the minimum . the stable and unstable regions in the @xmath187-@xmath188 plane shown in figures 4 and 8 of @xcite are qualitatively similar to those in our figures [ fig:1.0]_a _ and [ fig:0.5]_a _ in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane , but it should be noted that their figures show simulations of their solution b ( for the coralie data ) with @xmath37 and @xmath38 changed , while our figures show simulations of the fits ( to the combined data set ) that minimize @xmath31 for the given @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the relatively large values of @xmath31 ( @xmath189 ) and rms ( @xmath190 ) of the fits presented in this paper suggest that the double - keplerian model may not fully explain the radial velocity data of hd 82943 . also hinting at the same possibility is the increase in the rms of the best fit from @xmath191 ( for the extracted coralie data alone ) to @xmath192 with the inclusion of the keck data , which fill in some gaps in the coralie data and increase the time span of observations .",
    "however , the rms and @xmath31 values are by themselves not very strong evidence , because our estimate ( @xmath46 ) for the radial velocity jitter has an uncertainty of @xmath47 and the jitter can be @xmath193 .",
    "on the other hand , there appears to be systematic deviations of the radial velocity data from the double - keplerian fits . figure",
    "[ fig : res ] shows that the data within about @xmath194 days of jd 2452600 are higher than the fits and that the data near jd 2453181 are lower than the fits .",
    "the fact that @xmath195 of the keck measurements fall in these two regions result in the aforementioned increase in the rms of the best fit from @xmath191 for the coralie data alone to @xmath192 for the combined data set .",
    "but it is important to note that the keck and coralie data are consistent with each other where they overlap and that they are both higher than the fits in the region around jd 2452600 .",
    "one possible explanation for the deviations is that they are due to the mutual gravitational interaction of the planets .",
    "however , unlike the gj 876 system where the resonance - induced apsidal precession rate @xmath196 is @xmath197 on average and the precession has been seen for more than one full period @xcite , the average apsidal precession rates of , e.g. , fits ii and iii are only @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively , and the orbits have precessed a negligible @xmath200@xmath201 degrees over the @xmath57 time span of the available observations . on the other hand ,",
    "there are small variations in the orbital elements on shorter timescales due to the planetary interaction that could produce deviations from the double - keplerian model .",
    "alternatively , the deviations could be due to the presence of additional planet(s ) .",
    "continued observations of hd 82943 combined with dynamical fits should allow us to distinguish these possibilities .",
