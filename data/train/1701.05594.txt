    "as the masses of pluto and charon vastly exceed the masses of the other satellites , we refer to pluto and charon as a binary and styx , nix , kerberos and hydra as minor satellites of the pluto - charon binary .",
    "over 110 myr , tidal evolution should have synchronized the rotation of pluto and charon and then circularized their orbit , expanding the binary to its present separation @xcite",
    ". tidal evolution of pluto - charon would lead to capture of the minor satellites into mean motion orbital resonances .",
    "however numerical integrations have shown that this often causes such wide - scale dynamical instability that resonant transport ( migration ) of minor satellites to their current location probably did not take place @xcite .",
    "alternatively the smaller satellites could have formed from a circumbinary disk , and after the formation , spin synchronization and circularization of the pluto - charon binary @xcite .",
    "prior to the arrival of the new horizon s mission at pluto , @xcite explored possible spin states for the minor satellites .",
    "they speculated that the minor satellites would have tidally spun down and so would be slowly spinning , with angular spin rate @xmath0 similar to the orbital mean motion @xmath1 .",
    "a tumbling body is one with angular momentum spin vector that is not aligned with a principal body axis ( an eigenvector of the body s moment of inertia tensor ) .",
    "@xcite speculated that the minor satellites would be chaotically wobbling or tumbling due to instability associated with spin - orbit resonances @xcite ( resonances where @xmath2 is commensurate with @xmath1 ) .",
    "they suggested that perturbations from charon could affect the rotation state of the minor satellites , contributing to chaotic tumbling , in analogy to how an orbital resonance between titan and hyperion could affect the rotational state of hyperion @xcite .",
    "spin - spin resonance ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where spin @xmath0 is commensurate with the binary mean motion @xmath3 , might arise from charon s periodic perturbations .",
    "however , new horizons observations showed that the low mass satellites are spinning faster than considered by @xcite , with angular spin rates @xmath4 , many times greater than their orbital mean motions , implying that despinning due to tidal dissipation has not taken place @xcite .",
    "the angle between the spin vector of a minor satellite and the orbit normal of the pluto - charon binary can be called an obliquity . @xcite",
    "measured the obliquities of pluto s minor satellites and found that all four have obliquities near 90 degrees , with spin vector lying nearly in their orbital planes .",

    "if the minor satellites have not spun down , then neither should their obliquities have approached @xmath6 .",
    "it is unlikely that the high minor satellite obliquities in the pluto - charon system are due to tidal secular ( non - resonant ) obliquity evolution alone .    with near integer orbital period ratios between satellites ,",
    "the pluto - charon satellite system is near orbital mean motion resonances and may have crossed or been captured into these resonances in the past .",
    "migration could have take place due to tidal evolution of pluto and charon but also due to interactions with a previous and now absent circumbinary disk .",

    "with tidal dissipation alone and a moderate level of spin - down we can only explain the high obliquity of styx .",
    "we now explore the possibility that the satellites could have been captured into mean - motion resonance due to outward migration of charon with respect to pluto .",
    "slow separation of the pluto - charon binary could have been caused by tidal interaction between pluto and charon @xcite .",
    "mean motion resonant capture can also take place if a minor satellite migrates inward , and this could have occurred via interaction with a circumstellar disk .    to migrate the binary ( slowly separate pluto and charon ) we apply small velocity kicks to each body in the binary using the recipe for migration given in equations 8 - 11 by @xcite .",

    "the migration rate depends on @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "we adopt a convention @xmath53 corresponding to outward migration which allows an external minor satellite to be captured into mean - motion resonance .",
    "we ran a series of simulations with a migrating binary and with parameters listed in tables [ tab : common ] , [ tab : series_body ] , and[tab : series_b ] that are shown in figures [ fig : styx - b ]  [ fig : nix - b ] .",
    "initial conditions are similar to those listed in table [ tab : series_nd ] except the initial binary semi - major axis is smaller so as to let the binary approach the current satellite values .",
    "the body axis ratios are identical , but the dissipation in the spinning body is lower , and the initial obliquities are @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig : styx - b ]  [ fig : nix - b ] show that as the binary separates , the minor satellite captured into mean motion resonance . in the styx - b1,b2 simulations it is the 3:1 mean motion resonance and initially only the inclination increases , whereas for the nix simulations the mean motion resonance is the 4:1 and both eccentricity and inclination increase .",
    "the 4:1 resonance is a third order resonance ( in eccentricity ) and its lowest order resonant arguments all contain the longitude of pericenter , @xmath55 ( see the appendices by @xcite ) .",
    "all resonant subterms affect the eccentricity .",
    "the 3:1 resonance is second order and does contain subterms with arguments that lack the longitude of pericenter and so one of these causes an increase in the inclination and not the eccentricity . in both cases the minor satellite obliquity",
    "is lifted to high values , near @xmath6 .",
    "the lift in obliquity for nix is particularly interesting because it is a mechanism for lifting obliquity that functions even at nix s high spin rate .",
    "the mechanism also works for styx even though we found previously that styx can undergo intermittent obliquity without mean motion resonance capture .",
    "we ran similar simulations for kerberos drifting the binary apart , but none of our simulations illustrated capture into 5:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "kerberos is more easily captured into mean motion resonance by nix and that could have lifted its orbital inclination .",
    "we suspect that a similar obliquity lifting mechanism might work for kerberos but it would involve at least four 4 bodies ; nix to capture kerberos into mean motion resonance and a simultaneous commensurability with kerberos s spin precession rate and the pluto - charon binary to lift kerberos s obliquity .      because nix is spinning more rapidly than styx , its spin precession rate , @xmath56 , is closer to @xmath57 , its precession rate of the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "the nix - t1 simulation ( figure [ fig : nix - nd]a ) begins with the spinning body in a cassini state with @xmath58 and the system remains in a cassini state except for a brief period near @xmath59 .",
    "that @xmath58 means that in mean motion resonance the spin precession rate lines up with the mean motion resonant angle and this coupled with the binary inclination is likely to account for the large obliquity variations . in resonance",
    "the binary perturbations are in phase with the tilt angle of the body . a similar simulation but with an initial obliquity of @xmath60 , the nix - t2 simulation , ( figure [ fig : nix - b]b ) starts outside cassini state ( @xmath61 ) but moves into it after mean - motion resonance capture , probably because of the orbital inclination increase caused by the mean motion resonance . in that simulation",
    "the satellite exits mean motion resonance leaving the body in a state similar to that at the end of the nix - b1 simulation ( figure [ fig : nix - b]a ) with high obliquity oscillations .",
    "the styx - b1 simulation ( figure [ fig : styx - b]a ) also begins in a cassini state .",
    "as the system approaches mean motion resonance there is a large increase in obliquity .",
    "mean motion resonance is entered about @xmath62 whereas the obliquity increase begins at about @xmath63 at which time the satellite also exits cassini state . outside of the cassini state",
    "the body spin precession rate is about 3 times higher ( in amplitude ) than the rate of precession of the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "as the mean motion resonance is approached the body spin precession rate would be commensurate with the mean motion resonance resonant angle before the longitude of ascending node .",
    "in other words @xmath64 prior to @xmath65.the increase in obliquity prior to entering the mean motion resonance is more clearly seen in the styx - b2 simulation ( figure [ fig : styx - b]b ) as it only enters cassini state after capture into the mean motion resonance .",
    "we suspect that the obliquity increases prior to entering mean motion resonance are due to a commensurability involving the mean motion resonance and euler angle @xmath66 . to check this possibility we plot inclination and obliquity for the styx simulations along with resonant angles in figure [ fig : styx - ang ] for simulations styx - b1 and styx - b2 .",
    "in these figures three resonant arguments are plotted : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the mean longitude of satellite and binary , respectively , @xmath69 is the longitude of the ascending node of the satellite and @xmath66 is the precession angle of the spinning satellite .",
    "the last of these arguments , @xmath70 , is the argument associated with the @xmath71 ( inclination squared ) part of the 3:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "the top two arguments involve the precession angle of the satellite .",
    "figure [ fig : styx - ang]a , showing the styx - b1 simulation , shows @xmath72 freezing ( or librating about a fixed value ) during the same time period that the obliquity increases , whereas figure [ fig : styx - ang]b showing the styx - b2 simulation , shows @xmath73 freezing ( librating about 0 ) during the time period that the obliquity increases .",
    "the freezing of these angles in the simulations suggests that these resonances are responsible for the large obliquity variations . in both styx - b1,b2 simulations , @xmath70 , associated with the mean motion resonances ,",
    "is only librating when the orbital inclination increases and after the obliquity has reached a high value .",
    "the simulations shown in figures [ fig : styx - b ] - [ fig : styx - ang ] with an outward drifting binary suggest that obliquity variation is associated with an increase in orbital inclination and proximity or capture into mean motion resonance .",
    "however the obliquity increases tend to take place just before entering resonance implying that a commensurability between mean motion resonance and spin - precession frequency is responsible .",
    "since this type of resonance is associated with the spin precession we could call it a three - body secular resonance , except with such elongated bodies as pluto s minor satellites the spin precession frequency at low obliquity is not particular slow .",
    "and since such a commensurability involves a mean motion resonance , in terms of its orbital properties it is not secular ( it depends on mean longitudes which are usually averaged for secular resonances ) .",
    "the resonance ( involving spin precession and mean motions ) might be important precisely because the spin precession frequencies are fast .",
    "we lack a model for resonances with arguments given by @xmath74 in equation [ eqn : arguments ] , but we can estimate a timescale associated with obliquity increase in resonance .",
    "we suspect that a torque in resonance would be similar to the torque from a spin - spin resonance ( see equation [ eqn : ass ] and based on equation 7 by @xcite ) .",
    "the torque should be a few times lower because we must average the effect of the spin - spin resonance over the orbit while in mean motion resonance and it should depend on the obliquity . ignoring these dependencies",
    "the torque is of order @xmath75 with moment of inertia @xmath32 .",
    "we estimate a timescale for obliquity change with @xmath76 giving @xmath77^{-1}. \\label{eqn : tobl}\\ ] ] taking @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( from the bottom of table [ tab : sats ] ) we estimate a timescale for a large obliquity change @xmath80 or about 100 orbital periods . in units of @xmath81 ( like our simulations )",
    "an orbital period is about 100 giving @xmath82 .",
    "the timescale for obliquity change seen for styx ( see figures [ fig : styx - b ] ) is about @xmath83 and for nix , with higher spin , is slower a few times @xmath83 ( see figures [ fig : nix - b ] ) .",
    "this an order of magnitude higher than estimated with equation [ eqn : tobl ] .",
    "the discrepancy is comfortably wide , wide enough that drift within resonance , reduction in strength from averaging over fast angles and body angular orientation ( obliquity ) and inclination dependence can probably be taken into account still giving the resonance enough strength to lift the obliquity .",
    "the comparison suggests that this type of resonance is capable of lifting the obliquities on the timescales seen in the simulations .",
    "our simulations do not exhibit obliquity @xmath84 , with respect to the binary orbit , greater than @xmath6 , corresponding to retrograde spin .",
    "styx and kerberos have near @xmath6 obliquities whereas nix and hydra have higher obliquities of 123@xmath85 and 110@xmath85 , respectively .",
    "we notice from table [ tab : sats ] that styx and kerberos have period ratio @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the nearest integer ( 3 and 5 respectively ) , whereas nix and hydra have period ratio subtracted by the nearest integer @xmath87 ( 4 and 6 respectively ) less than zero .",
    "styx and kerberos have @xmath88 whereas @xmath89 for nix and hydra .",
    "the two satellites with the highest , and retrograde obliquities also have positive @xmath90 .",
    "perhaps there is a connection between the obliquity and the side of the orbital resonance . with retrograde spin ( or @xmath91 ) , the spin precession rate @xmath92 rather than negative ( as is true for styx and kerberos ) . thus nix and hydra could be near commensurability with fixed or librating resonant argument @xmath93 or @xmath94 .    with initial conditions at low obliquity , our simulations did not ever exhibit retrograde obliquities , but perhaps with additional orbital migration retrograde spins could be induced .",
    "the one simulation where the system leaves mean motion resonance and crosses to the side of mean motion resonance that nix and hydra are on is the nix - b2 simulation ( figure [ fig : nix - b]b ) .",
    "however , in this simulation , the satellite did not stay in spin resonance when exiting the mean motion resonance though the satellite did stay in a cassini state .",
    "the spin state exhibits high obliquity swings and perhaps further evolution could induce retrograde spin , or there may be a diversity of ways that the body can exit the mean motion resonance in the full n - body system including all minor satellites .",
    "we reexamine the intermittent obliquity variations shown in simulation styx - t1 ( figure [ fig : styx - nd ] ) lacking binary migration .",
    "the obliquity panel ( top left ) shows that when the obliquity is high , the body is in a cassini state and when the obliquity is low it is not in one .",
    "when the obliquity is low , the precession rate is high enough that it might be commensurate with the 3:1 mean motion resonant angle . to see if this is the case we created a figure similar to figure [ fig : styx - ang ] but for the styx - t1 simulation .",
    "resonant angles @xmath74 show librating regions and these do occur during obliquity variations .",
    "we might attribute the intermittent chaotic obliquity evolution to perturbations from multiple terms involving the mean motion resonance and the body s spin precession angle .",
    "estimates of tidal spin - down time suggest that none of pluto and charon s minor satellites have had time during the age of the solar system to reach near spin - synchronous states and this is consistent with the observed spin rates @xcite .",
    "mass spring model simulations with tidal dissipation , but allowing only moderate spin - down , show that only minor changes in minor satellite obliquity are caused by crossing spin orbit resonances , though our simulation method does exhibit spin - orbit resonance capture at lower spin rates . the high spin rates makes the spin - orbit resonances sensitive to orbital eccentricity to a high power and so very weak .",
    "spin - spin resonances with the binary depend on the binary quadrupole moment and so could remain strong at the high spin rates .",
    "nevertheless , only small jumps in spin are seen when crossing these and with dozens of simulations we have found that even temporary capture into them is rare . only styx experiences large and intermittent obliquity variations when evolving tidally .",
    "proximity to the 3:1 mean motion resonance and few degree orbital inclination seem to be required for styx to show large and intermittent obliquity variations .    simulations allowing the pluto - charon binary to slowly drift apart cause styx to be captured into 3:1 mean motion resonance with the binary and nix to be captured into 4:1 resonance .",
    "inclination sensitive parts of these resonances are encountered first , and these increase the orbital inclination .",
    "the satellite obliquities are lifted to near @xmath6 either on approach to or in mean motion resonance , depending upon whether the satellite is in a cassini state or not .",
    "we suspect that the obliquity increases are caused by a commensurability between the mean motion resonance argument frequency and the satellite spin precession rate .",
    "this resonance is likely because the satellites are sufficiently elongated that the spin precession rates at low obliquity are fairly fast .",
    "re - examination of the styx simulation showing intermittent obliquity variations suggests that this type of resonance could contribute to styx s chaotic behavior .",
    "the mechanism for lifting obliquity , involving mean motion resonance and spin precession , functions for both nix and styx even though nix is spinning much faster than styx .",
    "we have explored only 3 body integrations , the binary and a single resolved elongated spinning body .",
    "our mechanism lifting styx and nix s obliquities was not effective in our simulations for kerberos that failed to capture kerberos into 5:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "simulations involving 4 or more satellites might succeed in lifting kerberos s obliquity with a similar mechanism . kerberos s orbital inclination could be increased via capture into 5:4 resonance with nix and its obliquity lifted at the same time . since",
    "this mechanism is not strongly dependent on the satellite spin rate , it may also work for the more rapidly spinning hydra , perhaps via a 3:2 mean motion resonance with nix .",
    "as all four satellites are near mean motion resonances , a mechanism that involves mean motion resonances and lifts obliquities ( via matching spin precession ) could operate effectively on all four minor satellites perhaps explaining why all of them are near @xmath6 .",
    "styx and kerberos , both inside mean motion resonance with charon , have lower obliquities than nix and hydra , that are outside of mean motion resonance with charon .",
    "there may be a connection between the direction of spin , prograde or retrograde , and the side of mean motion resonance .",
    "while our simulations did not induce retrograde spins , perhaps later orbital migration or tidal evolution in the full n - body system ( with all 4 minor satellites ) could induce these spin end - states .",
    "we started our simulations with minor satellite spinning along a principal body axis , however kerberos s tumbling decay timescale might be so long that it could experience orbital evolution before its wobble decays . in future we could explore spin evolution of initially tumbling states ;",
    "perhaps kerberos is more likely to capture into spin resonances if it is tumbling .",
    "if capture into mean motion resonance is required to account for pluto and charon s high minor satellite obliquities then we could infer that all of the minor satellites were previous captured into mean motion resonance .",
    "however this would conflict with dynamical studies of the orbital evolution showing that this causes instability @xcite .",
    "perhaps migration , resonance capture and associated obliquity increases could have taken place when a circumbinary disk was still present that could damp inclinations and eccentricities and stabilize the orbits  or the system may have actually experienced episodes of instability and reformation .",
    "we lack simple dynamical models for phenomena seen in our simulations , such as excitation of tumbling .",
    "the complexity of the potential ( dependence on at least 3 angles ) for quadrupole / quadrupole body gravitational interactions @xcite implies that constructing a more general model for spin - spin resonance ( beyond @xcite ) that includes obliquity and tumbling would be challenging . though we suspect a spin - precession / mean motion resonance mechanism for obliquity increase , we lack a dynamical model that would allow us to assess the resonance strength .",
    "our mechanism seems to require past orbital misalignments with non - zero but few degree satellite orbital inclinations with respect to the binary .",
    "future observations or ongoing analysis of new horizons observations should determine whether such inclinations are currently ruled out .",
    "after escape from resonance in the nix - b2 simulation ( figure [ fig : nix - b]b ) nix exhibits large obliquity swings from near 0 to near @xmath6 at a period of about @xmath95 or corresponding to order @xmath96 orbital periods or a few years in real time . if nix or styx is currently in such a spin state , large obliquity variations might be observed .",
    "the obliquity lifting mechanism seen here involves fast precession rates ( due to body ) elongation and mean motion resonance with a massive binary .",
    "it would be interesting to explore other settings where a similar resonance might operate .",
    "uranus is more nearly spherical but in the past might have been in mean motion resonance with saturn or jupiter .",
    "perhaps uranus s high obliquity could have been lifted because of its past interaction with mean motion resonance , as seen here , rather than due to secular resonance @xcite or collisions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> new horizons mission observations show that the small satellites styx , nix , kerberos and hydra , of the pluto - charon system , have not tidally spun - down to near synchronous spin states and have high obliquities with respect to their orbit about the pluto - charon binary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use a damped mass - spring model within an n - body simulation to study spin and obliquity evolution for single spinning non - round bodies in circumbinary orbit . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with tidal dissipation alone do not show strong obliquity variations from tidally induced spin - orbit resonance crossing and this we attribute to the high satellite spin rates and low orbital eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> however , a tidally evolving styx exhibits intermittent obliquity variations and episodes of tumbling . during a previous epoch where charon migrated away from pluto , the minor satellites could have been trapped in orbital mean motion inclination resonances . </S>",
    "<S> an outward migrating charon induces large variations in nix and styx s obliquities . </S>",
    "<S> the cause is a commensurability between the mean motion resonance frequency and the spin precession rate of the spinning body . </S>",
    "<S> as the minor satellites are near mean motion resonances , this mechanism could have lifted the obliquities of all four minor satellites . if so the high obliquities of pluto and charon s minor satellites imply that this system experienced orbital migration and all satellites were at one time captured into mean motion resonances . </S>"
