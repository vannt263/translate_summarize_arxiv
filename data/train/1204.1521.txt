    "the very first picture of an inflationary multiverse scenario was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it would seem that the author wanted to suggest a universe without the cosmological singularity problem using an interesting feature of self - reproducting or regenerating exponential expansion of the universe .",
    "a major development in this scenario was triggered by the discovery of the eternal inflationary scenario @xcite and a paradigm for string theory landscape @xcite .",
    "the eternal inflation is related to the expanding false vacuum solution with a positive cosmological constant , which in turn means that the inflation is eternal into the future .",
    "if the theory has multiple minima then the false vacuum state decays into the true vacuum state , i.e. the phase transition proceeded _ via _ the nucleation of a vacuum bubble . in this scenario",
    "the universe is situated within some bubble called a pocket universe @xcite having a certain value of the cosmological constant and the whole universes are referred to as multiverse . the description of self - reproduction including tunneling process and random walk was combined into a scenario called recycling universe @xcite .",
    "these scenarios seem to provide an escape from the question of the initial conditions of the universe , i.e. it seems to be eternal into the past .",
    "unfortunately , inflationary spacetimes can not be made complete in the past direction @xcite , even though the universe is eternal into the future .",
    "there are still interesting arguments on the beginning of the universe @xcite .",
    "the string theory landscape is a setting that involves a huge number of different metastable and stable vacua @xcite , originated from different choices of calabi - yau manifolds and generalized magnetic fluxes .",
    "the huge number of different vacua can be approximated by the potential of a scalar field .",
    "the important thing is the fact that , once the de sitter vacuum can exist , the inflationary expansion is eternal into the future and has the possibility of self - reproduction .    on the other hand , there are theories of gauged @xmath1 , @xmath2 supergravity having de sitter(ds ) solution , in which all susys are spontaneously broken .",
    "it is well known that the ds solution corresponds to a m / sting theory solution with a non - compact @xmath3- or @xmath4-dimensional internal space , in which a small value of the cosmological constant stems from the @xmath5-form flux .",
    "the simplest representative of these kind of theories has a tachyonic potential with the ds maxima @xcite .",
    "the potential in the vicinity of the maximum reduces to a form having a quadratic term , that is not metastable but unstable .",
    "however , according to some authors , the time for collapse giving rise to the tachyonic potential can be much greater than the age of the universe for anthropic reasoning .",
    "if the curvature radius of the potential in the vicinity of the maximum is greater than that used in the above theory , then that will be all together different story .",
    "the supergravity analogue of the tachyonic potential could be constructed also by using an exact supergravity solution representing the @xmath6-@xmath7 system @xcite .    from the above scenarios , the study of the possibility of the tunneling process for the potential with stable and metastable vacua , or even tachyonic behavior has acquired renewed interest . in the present paper",
    ", we will study the tunneling process under a simple tachyonic potential governed by a quartic term both without the quadratic term and with the term as a toy model . to obtain the general solution including the effect of the backreaction",
    ", we solve the coupled equations for the gravity and the scalar field simultaneously .",
    "although the model has a tachyonic potential , it might still be an useful example to show how the tunneling process occurs in various shapes of the potential provided by the above scenarios .",
    "a quantum particle can tunnel through a finite potential barrier _ via _ the so - called barrier penetration .",
    "this process can be described by the euclidean solution obeying appropriate boundary conditions . there",
    "exist two kinds of euclidean solutions describing quantum tunneling phenomena .",
    "one corresponds to an instanton solution representing a stable pseudoparticle configuration characterized by the existence of a nontrivial topological charge .",
    "it does not change even if we continuously deform the field , as long as the boundary conditions remain the same .",
    "the instanton solution corresponds to the minimum of the euclidean action to pass from the initial to final state @xcite .",
    "the solution , in case of a double well potential , describes a general shift in the ground state energy of the classical vacuum due to the presence of an additional potential well , then lifting the so - called classical degeneracy .",
    "the other is a bounce solution representing an unstable nontopological configuration that corresponds to a saddle point rather than a minimum of the euclidean action .",
    "the second derivative of the euclidean action around the bounce has one negative eigenvalue which leads to the imaginary part of the energy .",
    "the existence of the negative eigenvalue implies that the vacuum state is unstable , i.e. the state decays into other states @xcite .",
    "the euclidean solutions can also mediate phase transitions .",
    "the phase transition describes the sudden change of a physical system from one state to another .",
    "the transition are of two different types transition accompanied by temperature or zero temperature .",
    "the competition between the entropy and the energy terms in the thermodynamic potential cause thermal phase transitions in which dynamics is irrelevant . in the modern classification scheme ,",
    "thermal phase transitions are divided into two broad categories either with a discontinuous jump in the first - order derivatives of the free energy or without it .",
    "a first - order phase transition is characterized by the discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy and is associated with the existence of latent heat , whereas a @xmath8th - order phase transition is characterized by the continuity in the first derivative while there is a discontinuity in the @xmath8th - order derivative .",
    "a quantum phase transition describes a transition between different phases by quantum fluctuation , which occurs at zero temperature , unlike the case of a thermal phase transition which is governed by a thermal fluctuation @xcite .    to simplify things",
    ", we consider an asymmetric double well potential to distinguish two different phase transitions at zero temperature .",
    "if the initial state is the metastable vacuum state and the tunneling occurs from that state to the other vacuum state , then the transition corresponds to a tunneling process @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial state is the local maxima of the potential and the field is rolling down to one vacuum state continuously rather than any discontinuous jump , then the transition corresponds to the rolling .",
    "however , one more channel exists as tunneling and that corresponds to the one without a barrier . in this kind of transition",
    ", the initial state on the top of a potential can tunnel to the other state rather than rolling down the potential @xcite .",
    "there are two different kind of transitions in this case .",
    "one is the tunneling without a barrier representing the tunneling from the local maximum of the potential to the vacuum state @xcite . recently ,",
    "an analytic study on this type of solution was performed in @xcite .",
    "the other is a tunneling without a barrier representing the tunneling from the maximum of the potential to any arbitrary state .",
    "this case corresponds to the fubini instanton @xcite , where the tachyonic potential is employed .",
    "can we describe the rolling corresponding to the transition between the initial metastable vacuum state and the other final vacuum state ?",
    "this may look similar to a superfluid motion by the liquid helium .",
    "although to establish the phase transition corresponding to the superfluid motion is itself a very challenging problem , we concentrate on the fubini instantons in this work .",
    "the fubini instanton @xcite describes the decay of a vacuum state by the quantum phase transition instead of rolling down the tachyonic potential consisted of a quartic term only . on the other hand",
    ", one can consider a tachyonic potential consisted of a quadratic term only , the point @xmath9 is unstable .",
    "a small perturbation will cause it to roll down the hill of the potential .",
    "originally , it was fubini who introduced a fundamental scale of hadron phenomena by means of the dilatation noninvariant vacuum state in the framework of a scale invariant lagrangian field theory @xcite . however , the solution is a one - parameter family of instanton solutions representing a tunneling without a barrier as an interpolating solution from the maximum of the potential to any arbitrary state .",
    "the instanton solution was studied in a conformally invariant model , i.e. a fixed background was used and the effect of the backreaction by instantons was neglected @xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation , when the variation of the potential during the transition is much smaller than the maximum of the potential .",
    "the instanton has gained much interest now - a - days in the context of anti - de sitter(ads)/conformal field theory correspondence @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 , we review the fubini instanton in the absence of gravity .",
    "we present numerical solutions including the euclidean energy density as an example and analyze the structure of the solution in the theory with a potential having only the quartic self - interaction term .",
    "we stress the fact that there is no such solutions with the potential containing both the quartic and the quadratic terms . in sec .  3",
    ", we show that the instanton solutions exist in the curved space .",
    "we perform a numerical study to solve the coupled equations for the gravity and the scalar field simultaneously .",
    "we show that there exist numerical solutions without oscillation in the initial ads space in the potential with only the quartic term .",
    "we also show that there exist numerical solutions in the potential both with the quartic and the quadratic terms irrespective of the value of the cosmological constant , which is possible only when the gravity is switched on . in order to estimate the decay rate of the background state",
    ", we compute the action difference between that of the solution and the background obtained by numerical means .",
    "we present an oscillating numerical solutions in the potential with only the quartic term with various values of the cosmological constant .",
    "one type of these solutions has the structure with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we will discuss on the interpretation of the solutions with @xmath0 symmetry in the final section .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the solutions using the phase diagram method . in sec .  4 , to observe the dynamics of the solutions , we briefly sketch the causal structures of the solutions in the lorentzian spacetime . finally in sec .  5 , we summarize and discuss our results .",

    "however , the existence of zero modes is not guaranteed in curved spacetime .",
    "another point is that the euclidean time interval is at most of @xmath275 in de sitter space .",
    "hence , only a finite number of the bounces can be placed far apart from each other . therefore , the dilute gas approximation may become invalid easily , which leads to the breakdown of the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "there appears diverse situations on the negative modes when the gravity is taken into account @xcite .",
    "although , the bounce solution with one negative mode in curved space dominates the tunneling process , the solutions with additional negative modes may also contribute to the tunneling process .",
    "there exist some works including the physical interpretation on the oscillating solutions with more than one negative mode .",
    "one can naturally interpret the system in de sitter background as a thermal system .",
    "the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite interpreted that the existence of additional negative modes represents the solutions as unstable intermediate thermal configuration .",
    "they seem to observe the clue to support this idea on the other point of view .",

    "the even numbers of negative modes of the form @xmath277 and @xmath278 do not have imaginary part of the energy , while the odd numbers of negative modes of the form @xmath279 have the imaginary part of the energy with the wrong sign .",
    "however , @xmath280 negative modes may have a meaning for a tunneling process even if the solution may not be related to the lowest wkb approximation .",
    "recently the analysis on the negative modes of oscillating instantons has been investigated @xcite .",
    "the oscillating instantons as homogeneous tunneling channels have been also studied @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", we believe many euclidean solutions in curved space with zero and negative modes may have physical significance and deserves further investigation .    in summary",
    ", we illustrate the following finding in our new contribution regarding this issue :    1 .   in the absence of gravity",
    ", a @xmath281-type potential has infinitely many instanton solutions whereas a @xmath282-type potential has no instanton solution .",
    "however , _",
    "the inclusion of the gravity changes all the situation abruptly _ :",
    "for the former case , the solution space get reduced to a finite space and for the latter case , there exists solutions .",
    "we also confirm that @xmath281-type potentials have oscillating instanton solutions as well as the solutions with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "therefore , the fubini instanton is one of the few examples that shows the effect of gravity bringing drastic changes to the tunneling process .",
    "there can be more applications of the oscillating instantons and we confirm that the fubini - type potentials also contribute largely towards these processes .",
