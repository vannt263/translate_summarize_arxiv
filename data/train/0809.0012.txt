    "a non - magnetized case emerges as a limit of the magnetized case .",
    "the discussion is divided into three separate topics .",

    "i derive a surprisingly simple analytic expression for arbitrary temperature @xmath12    the smallness of @xmath13 @xmath14 in the real systems led some authors @xcite to conclude that the high - frequency approximation will always work .",
    "however , there is a clear indication that it breaks down at high temperatures @xmath15 it was claimed that the eigenmodes of plasma are linearly polarized for high temperatures @xmath11 @xcite , because the second order term @xmath16 becomes larger than the first order term @xmath17 due to the @xmath7 dependence .",

    "i find the generalized rotation measure as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath7 without expanding in @xmath4 and compare the results with the known high - frequency expressions .",
    "the high-@xmath7 behavior of the plasma response is indeed significantly different .",
    "plasma physics involves complicated calculations .",
    "this led to a number of errors in the literature @xcite , some of which have still not been fixed . in the article",

    "i retain only the first - order correction in @xmath97 since @xmath10 in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "since @xmath151 at low @xmath97 the non - relativistic dispersion measure ( dm ) should be modified as @xmath152 this shows that the gas density is slightly underestimated , if the non - relativistic formulas are used .",
    "however , the relativistic correction to the dm is small and can be neglected in most practical cases when @xmath153 the effects in magnetized plasma are also relevant for pulsars .",
    "relativistic plasmas exhibit a generalized faraday rotation for a general orientation of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "one can decompose it into two effects : faraday rotation and faraday conversion .",
    "the former operates alone at @xmath154 the latter operates alone at @xmath155 and both should be considered together for the intermediate angles .",
    "the transfer equations ( mueller calculus ) for the stokes parameters @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 were devised to treat together the propagation effects , emission , and absorption @xcite .",
    "good approximations for emission and absorption have been long known @xcite .",
    "now one can combine them with the proper approximations of the propagation effects given by @xmath160 @xmath161 and do the radiative transfer calculations . here",

    "the authors treat the ordinary and extraordinary modes as linearly polarized .",
    "they assume these eigenmodes constitute a basis , where either @xmath163 or @xmath164 components of emissivity and propagation coefficients vanish .",
    "actually , @xmath163 components vanish ( @xmath165 ) already in the basis @xmath166 since the projection of the magnetic field onto @xmath167 is parallel to @xmath59 ( see @xcite p.184 ) . as i have shown in the ",
    "[ modes ] , plasma modes are far from being linearly polarized at temperatures @xmath168 estimated for the gc @xcite .",
    "thus , the propagation coefficients should be taken from equations ( [ diagdifffit ] ) and ( [ nondiagfit ] ) .",
    "the faraday conversion coefficient @xmath169 can not be defined via emissivities and faraday rotation coefficient @xmath170 as in @xcite .",
    "the faraday rotation measure was calculated from a simulated accretion profile in @xcite .",
    "however , the paper considered only the faraday rotation and did not carry out the self - consistent treatment of propagation .",
    "it is impossible to disentangle the effects of faraday rotation and faraday conversion in a relativistic plasma .",
    "the crucial part of any radiative transfer is the proper transfer coefficients .",
    "it allows one to estimate the electron density near the accreting object @xcite .",
    "several formulas were suggested for the temperature dependence of the component @xmath122 responsible for faraday rotation .",
    "these formulas were yet given for the high - frequency approximation ( see   [ high_freq ] ) .",
    "let me compare them with the exact temperature dependence ( [ nondiag ] ) @xmath171 and its limits .",

    "this brings @xmath178 to lower values and decreases the rotation measure .",
    "even with this decrease the rotation measure is severely overestimated at @xmath181 the convergence to the relativistic limit is not achieved even at @xmath182 the paper @xcite found the simpler fitting formula that reproduces the limits .",

    "the increase in the circular polarization of sgr a * at frequency 1thz is predicted by @xcite . the phase of faraday conversion approaches unity and the destructive interference does not occur at this frequency .",
    "the result seems to be qualitatively correct regardless of the expression for the conversion measure , but the proper expressions ( [ diagdifffit ] ) and ( [ nondiagfit ] ) should be used for quantitative predictions .      the better treatment of propagation effects may also play a role in observations of jets . as we saw in ",
    "[ low_dens ] , the propagation effects in thermal plasma can not be described in the lowest orders in @xmath125 if the temperature @xmath7 is sufficiently high .",
    "power - law distribution of electrons can have a quite high effective temperature .",
    "thus the high - frequency limit @xcite may not approximate well the hermitian part of the response tensor .",
    "careful analysis of jet observations @xcite may be needed .",
    "it should be based at least on the expressions for @xmath80 in a general low - density regime .",
    "this paper presents several new calculations and amends the previous calculations of propagation effects in uniform magnetized plasma with thermal particle distribution equation ( [ distrib ] ) . the expression ( [ main ] ) for the correct response tensor",
    "is given in a high - frequency approximation .",
    "the exact temperature dependence ( [ diag ] ) and ( [ nondiag ] ) is found in first orders in @xmath3 in addition to the known highly - relativistic and non - relativistic results .",
    "the higher order terms may be important for relativistic plasmas in jets and hot accretion flows .",
    "the fitting expressions ( [ gaunt_diag ] ) and ( [ gaunt_nondiag ] ) are found for the dielectric tensor components ( [ diagdifffit ] ) and ( [ nondiagfit ] ) at relatively high temperatures .    the results of numerical computations are given only when the corresponding analytical formulas are found .",
    "one can always compute the needed coefficients numerically for every particular frequency @xmath2 , plasma frequency @xmath184 cyclotron frequency @xmath185 and distribution of electrons .",
    "however , the analytic formulas offer a simpler and faster way of dealing with the radiative transfer for a non - specialist .",
    "the eigenmodes were not considered in much detail , since radiative transfer problems do not require a knowledge of eigenmodes . however",
    "the knowledge of eigenmodes is needed to compute the self - consistent response tensor ( see   [ exact ] ) .",
    "the response tensor in the form ( [ main ] ) can be expanded in @xmath3 and @xmath186 this expansion is of mathematical interest and will be presented in a subsequent paper as well as the expressions for a power - law electron distribution .",
