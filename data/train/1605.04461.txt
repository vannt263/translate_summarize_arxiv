    "a quantitative study of energetic particles ( ` cosmic rays ' ) and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters is motivated by the need for a more complete physical description of these systems , and for improved knowledge of the origin of non - thermal ( nt ) quantities in extragalactic environments .",
    "current and future measurement capabilities necessitate fairly detailed modeling of energetic particles , their origin and impact on the properties of intracluster ( ic ) gas .",
    "direct evidence for the presence of relativistic electrons in ic space is presently limited to measurements of extended regions of radio emission , ` halos ' and relics , which have already been observed in many clusters [ ] .",
    "mapping these extended low brightness regions is quite challenging due to the inherently imprecise process of subtracting out the emission from many galactic radio sources .",
    "searches for nt x - ray emission have not yet yielded conclusive results ( e.g. , [ ] )",

    "fermi_/lat measurements of 50 clusters yielded an upper limit on the mean emission above @xmath1 mev [ ] .",
    "radio measurements provide direct evidence for acceleration of electrons in sn shocks , whereas recent _ fermi_/lat measurements [ ] reveal the signature of acceleration also of protons , whose interactions with ambient protons produce neutral pions ( @xmath2 ) which decay into two ( @xmath3 mev ) photons , giving rise to the ` pion bump ' in the measured spectra .",
    "since energetic electrons and protons do not lose all their energy while diffusing out of their galactic sources , star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) are likely to contribute appreciably to their respective extragalactic energy densities .",
    "while the sources of the radio emitting electrons have not yet been fully identified these clearly include also radio galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested long ago that the ( typically ) transonic motion of galaxies through ic plasma excites turbulence that may re - accelerate particles , maintaining electron populations that could explain the observed radio halos [ ]",
    ". the main focus has been in merger and accretion shocks as particle acceleration sites ( e.g. , [ ] , [ ] ) .",
    "particle acceleration by mildly supersonic shocks in the dilute ic gas is not fully understood , and the efficiency of conversion of kinetic to particle energy is substantially uncertain .",
    "there is considerable motivation to model nt phenomena under typical conditions in most clusters .",
    "realistic estimates of the emission from particles originating in sfgs yield lower limits on ic emission . together with direct emission from the galaxies , a minimal level of the cluster total emission is obtained . adding the emission from sfgs to the similarly deduced emission of strong radio galaxies yields the total galactic and ic emission .",
    "a basic issue is whether the combined emission from all galactic sources can fully account for emission from a cluster radio halo",
    ". this important consideration has obvious implications for the need to assume efficient particle re - acceleration in ic space .",
    "the above considerations warrant a detailed assessment of galactic origin for energetic particles in clusters , our main objective here . in section 2",

    "we treat separately the evolution of electrons and protons from the very extended distribution of sfgs and that of electrons from strong radio sources in the cluster core .      in many radio halo clusters",
    "there are dominant radio galaxies within the core region , and a population of elliptical radio galaxies whose distribution is centrally peaked . for modeling simplicity , we consider the case when there are no strong radio sources outside the core and the total contribution of radio galaxies outside this region can be ignored . due to the special location of the central (",
    "agn - powered ) radio galaxies the period of their activity ( which is likely to be sustained by accretion and mergers ) , either continuously or intermittently , is longer than a typical lifetime of a radio galaxy . during this",
    "period radio sources that are not at the dynamical center move substantial distances across the cluster core .",
    "therefore , we model these galaxies as a spatially uniform core component with a source term that is scaled to their total radio luminosity and the mean value of their magnetic field .      the close link between high - mass stars and particle acceleration provides a basis for estimating the total number of galaxy - equivalent sfgs , @xmath31 , from the ratio of the cluster blue luminosity to the blue luminosity of the galaxy . in the coma cluster",

    "electron and proton escape rates from the galaxy were deduced based on results obtained by strong ( 2010 ; ref . [ ] ) from a set of diffusion and diffusive re - acceleration models with different galactic halo sizes . from the range of values for their different models",

    "as noted , we take the number of galaxy - equivalent sfgs to be @xmath74 .    in a 1.4 ghz survey of coma [ ] , 19 elliptical radio galaxies were identified as definite cluster members , including the very strong ngc4869 & ngc4874 in the cluster core .",
    "the emission of the other 17 elliptical radio is dominated by the ngc4839 and ngc4827 , which are part of the infalling ngc4839 group in the sw region of the cluster , the radio relic coma a. we confine our modeling to the nearly spherical radio halo , and since the extended emission of coma a is outside the central @xmath75 mpc radial region , we ignore the contribution of all the 17 galaxies to the electron density .",
    "radio emission scales as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the total number of emitting electrons and @xmath78 is the radio power - law index , but since the estimated mean magnetic fields in the extended radio emitting regions of the two central radio galaxies ( [ ] , ] ) are about the same as the mean galactic field ( @xmath79 g ) , we scale the galactic electron rate by the ratio of the combined radio luminosity of these galaxies to that of the galaxy . doing so yields a spectral escape rate of @xmath80 s@xmath70 , taking @xmath71 ; in our calculations we adopt a value that is lower by a factor of 2/3 .    the distributions of electrons and protons escaping sfgs and their yields",
    "are evolved for @xmath81 gyr ( over which the _ electron _ distribution is essentially in its asymptotic steady - state ) , whereas for electrons from the central radio galaxies we show results for @xmath82 gyr , a more typical time for their agn - powered emission , either continuously or successively .",
    "this period of activity is reasonable given the long duration of mergers and strong tidal interactions , processes that enhance particle acceleration in galactic nuclei .",
    "other key parameters in the calculation are the central value of the cluster magnetic field , @xmath83 g ( somewhat lower than deduced from faraday rotation measurements [ ] ) .",
    "a wide range of magnetic field coherence scales is expected , reflecting the varying properties of ic plasma , with values as low as a few tenths of a kpc to @xmath84 kpc .",
    "a fiducial value of @xmath82 kpc is adopted , for which @xmath85 @xmath86 s@xmath70 .",
    "having selected coma ( @xmath87 ) as our fiducial cluster , we adopt the ( @xmath88-like ) gas density profile used in the analysis of _ planck _ sz measurements [ ] @xmath89^{3\\beta } } \\frac{1}{\\left[1+(r / r_s)^3\\right]^{\\epsilon/3}}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 @xmath91 , @xmath92 mpc , @xmath93 @xmath94 mpc , and @xmath95 .",
    "we calculated the spectral radio synchrotron and compton ( in the thomson limit ) x - ray and @xmath0-emissivities by relativistic electrons , traversing ic fields and scattering off the cmb , using the relevant expressions in ref .",
    "the spectral @xmath0-ray emissivity from neutral pion decay was calculated using the expression in ref .",
    "the spectral and spatial distributions of radio emission by primary and secondary electrons originating in sfgs , and the corresponding emission by primary electrons from central radio galaxies , are shown in figure  ( [ fig : syspds ] ) .",
    "our fiducial spectral profile seems to be somewhat flatter than the trend seen in the data above @xmath75 ghz .",
    "in fact , a linear fit to current data yields a spectral index of @xmath96 ( at 95% significance ) that implies a somewhat steeper spectral profile of electrons emerging from radio and sfgs , i.e. , @xmath97 , rather than the value of @xmath98 adopted in our generic model .",
    "also shown are measurements of the coma halo compiled in ref .",
    "[ ] . for a direct comparison with the profile deduced from the 350 mhz measurements reported in ref .",
    "[ ] , and plotted in figure 10 in ref .",
    "[ ] , we convolved the ( line of sight ) integrated emissivities with a gaussian 10 ( fwhm ) beam .",
    "we note that the plotted 350 mhz data were obtained by azimuthally averaging the substantially angle - dependent emission profile ( shown in ref .",
    "above @xmath99 mpc , the plotted profile includes emission from the relic coma a , which is locally as much as a factor @xmath100 higher than the emission in the se part of the cluster . subtracting the flux of coma a in the the sw 0.8 - 1.4 mpc region would bring the data points appreciably closer to our profile .",
    "indeed , the profile of the coma halo was measured also at 1.4 ghz smoothed with 9.35 beam ) by deiss ( 1997 , ref . [ ] ) , whose data cover only the main halo region , @xmath101 mpc . as is obvious from the right panel of figure  ( [ fig : syspds ] ) , our profile agrees well with this steeper profile that does not include substantial emission from coma a. comparison of the measured profiles demonstrates the increased significance of the relative contribution of emission by electrons from sfgs , clearly establishing the need for sfgs as electron sources .",
    "the spatially integrated 350 mhz flux from coma is somewhat lower than that deduced from the measured profile , a difference that is reflected in the respective spatial profiles in figure  ( [ fig : syspds ] ) , with the predicted emission more pronounced in the cluster core , but this emission falls steeply and can not account for the measured emission beyond @xmath102 mpc .",
    "we emphasize that our aim here is to present generic features of our approach , rather than best - fitting model parameters to the specific coma spectral and spatial measurements .",
    "therefore , the fact that the predicted emission does not exactly match the observations is actually not surprising given the appreciable range of parameter ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) values .",
    "spectral @xmath0-ray luminosity by neutral pion decay is shown in figure  ( [ fig : gampd ] ) .",
    "the emission is spatially extended reflecting the large diffusion radii of the parent protons .",
    "also shown in the figure are the spectral distributions of x - and-@xmath0-ray emission by compton scattering of relativistic electrons off the cmb , whose combined power - law spectral luminosity has a mean index of @xmath106 .",
    "the emission is clearly more extended than in the radio ( due to the cmb spatial uniformity ) .",
    "the integrated luminosity above 100 mev , @xmath107 erg s@xmath70 , is mostly from @xmath2 decay .",
    "the approach adopted in our work is minimalistic as it rests on known properties of galactic energetic particles , quantitative description of their diffusion in ic space and consequent radiative yields , thereby establishing the level of radio emission beyond which turbulent ( re)acceleration might be needed to fully account for halo emission , if electrons and protons from star - forming and other widely distributed galaxies can not account for the relatively high 350 mhz emission measured in the outer region of the coma cluster .",
    "a basic result of our work is that with either known or estimated values of these quantities , the predicted level of the radio luminosity can be comparable to the measured value .",
    "the significance of this result rests also on the fact that we have not included any additional sources of energetic particles , such as agn or radio galaxies other than ngc 4869 & ngc 4874 .    of primary importance",
    "are the proton and electron escape fractions from a sfg , which are based on the detailed study in ref .",
    "[ ] . whereas for protons this fraction is only a few percent ,",
    "it is about half for electrons ; if anything , the calorimetric fraction is expected to be lower due to reduced halo size of a sfg in the more tidally interactive cluster environment . from a stacking analysis of 1.5 ghz measurements of 30 nearby field galaxies . ] nonetheless , the exact values of the electron escape rates from radio galaxies are uncertain ; a lower escape rate than estimated here would reduce the level of radio emission in the core , weakening the discrepancy with the measured 1.4 ghz profile .",
    "the dependence of synchrotron emission on the magnetic field , @xmath108 ( @xmath109 for coma ) is sufficiently steep to make the feasibility of detection of a low brightness radio halo very sensitive to specific conditions in the cluster . our fiducial",
    "_ central _",
    "value , @xmath110 g , implies a volume - averaged value of only @xmath111 g across the cluster .",
    "extended radio emission is far less ubiquitous than x - ray emission from ic gas .",
    "a major issue then is what cluster evolutionary processes give rise to this emission ; suggestions abound , ranging from strong radio galaxies and agn as sources of energetic particles , and particle acceleration by turbulent shocks excited by galactic motions or by merger shocks ( e.g. , ref . [ ] ) . various scaling relations reflecting correlations between radio emission and cluster properties",
    "have been either deduced or invoked in support of specific models",
    ". however , such relations may not always be reliable due to inherent parameter degeneracies , reflecting the considerable coupling between respective cluster properties and evolutionary processes .",
    "an example for this inherent limitation in testing a specific model for the origin of extended radio emission is the commonly advocated view that energetic particles are accelerated by merger shocks . indeed , during cluster hierarchical evolution , mergers of sub - clusters can create conditions under which shocks may have the properties required for efficient particle acceleration .",
    "but mergers enhance star formation in cluster galaxies , which also results in increased sn activity with the same end result of particle acceleration ; thus , a basic evolutionary process can be generically the root cause of different models for the origin of enhanced particle acceleration .",
    "the predicted level of emission from energetic protons and electrons emanating from sfgs and radio galaxies in a coma - like cluster is @xmath112 ergs@xmath70 .",
    "a recent search for emission from the coma region in the _",
    "fermi_/lat 6 yr database has not yielded a statistically significant detection [ ] ; the implied upper limit on emission above @xmath113 mev is about an order of magnitude higher than the level predicted here . obviously , this is a bound on the total emission from the coma region , including the intrinsic emission from all radio galaxies and sfgs .",
    "multiplying our overall normalization factor ( @xmath31 ) by the total luminosity of the galaxy [ ] we obtain @xmath114 for the range of models considered in the latter paper .",
    "also of much interest is the predicted nt x - ray luminosity due to compton scattering of relativistic electrons off the cmb . as shown in the right panel of figure 2 ,",
    "most of the compton emission is predicted to be by primary electrons originating in the central radio galaxies ; the total ( including contributions of electrons from sfgs ) @xmath115 mev luminosity is @xmath116 ergs@xmath70 . dedicated searches for nt emission above 20 kev began long ago [ ] and continued with almost all successive x - ray satellites .",
    "results of all these searches ( e.g. , refs . [ ] , [ ] ) yielded no unequivocal detections . for coma , extensive rxte measurements [ ] yielded the upper limit @xmath117 ergs@xmath70 , much higher than the luminosity of ic electrons predicted here .",
    "however , our estimated level is clearly a lower limit on the total cluster emission since it does not include intrinsic emission from galactic sources .",
