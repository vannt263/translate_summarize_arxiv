    "large scale gravitational torques , such as bars and interactions , are thought to transport gas into the central region of galaxies and , specifically , in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei ( shlosman et al .",
    "seyfert galaxies are the low luminosity subset of agns . according to the accreting supermassive black hole paradigm ,",
    "the accretion rate inferred for seyfert nuclei is low ( @xmath2 ) and , therefore , much fuelling from the host galaxy is not required . indeed , mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) , ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , mulchaey & regan ( 1997 ) show that the occurrence of bars in seyfert galaxies is not higher than in normal galaxies . yet",
    ", there is both theoretical and observational evidence that stellar bars do drive gas into the central region of galaxies ( athanassoula 1992 , tacconi et al .",
    "1997 , laine et al .",
    "the resulting central concentration of gas might not be relevant for the fuelling process , but can play a role in the obscuration of the active nucleus , i.e. stellar bars could contribute to the obscuration that affects seyfert 2s .",
    "this connection would be very important for the unified theories ( antonucci 1993 ) . in this letter",
    "we tackle this issue by comparing the degree of obscuration in sy2s with the strength of the stellar bar in their host galaxy .",
    "hard x - ray spectra can be regarded as the best tool to measure directly the absorbing column density in seyfert galaxies .",
    "recent surveys have significantly enlarged the sample of sy2s for which an estimate of n@xmath0 is available , and have also reduced the bias against heavily obscured objects that plagued former studies ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998a , bassani et al . 1998 , risaliti et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we restricted our study to obscured seyferts in the maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) sample , completed with 18 additional objects discovered in the ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) survey .",
    "these two seyfert samples are much less biased than others in terms of luminosity and obscuration of the active nucleus and , therefore , can be considered representative of the local population of seyfert galaxies .    for agns which are thin to compton scattering ( i.e. n@xmath3 ) along our line of sight",
    "the n@xmath0 can be derived from the photoelectric cutoff in the 210 kev spectral range , provided that the signal to noise is high enough .",
    "if the source is compton thick then the direct component in the 210 kev range is completely suppressed and we can only observe the reflected component , generally little absorbed . as a consequence , compton thick sy2s are sometimes misidentified as `` low absorption objects '' when observed in the 2 - 10 kev range .",
    "however , the fact that the absorbing column density is actually higher ( @xmath4 ) can be inferred from several indicators , such as the equivalent width of the fe line and the spectral slope , and by comparing the x - ray flux with other isotropic indicators of the intrinsic luminosity . a more detailed discussion of this issue is given in maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and bassani et al .",
    "we just mention that sensitive spectra at higher energies , such as those obtained by bepposax in the 10200 kev band , can identify column densities in the range @xmath5 ( matt et al .",
    "1998 , cappi et al .",
    "1998 ) or set a lower limit of @xmath6 ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998a ) .    .absorbing n@xmath0 and bar classification for the sy2s sample .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath7  @xmath8 = n band ( @xmath9 ) luminosity ; @xmath10 = 210 kev luminosity .",
    "large amounts of circumnuclear gas in sy1s could be detected via dust - reprocessed light in the infrared .",
    "more circumnuclear gas would imply more warm ( agn - heated ) dust , hence more infrared emission relative to the intrinsic luminosity of the agn ( traced by the hard x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "the mid  ir ( @xmath9 ) is an excellent band to look for this excess , since the agn ir emission peaks there ( maiolino et al . 1995 ) .",
    "also , by using narrow beam photometry it is possible to isolate the contribution of the agn from the host galaxy . within the scenario of the bar  circumnuclear gas connection , barred sy1s",
    "are expected to show a mid - ir to x - ray flux ratio higher than non - barred sy1s . yet",
    ", several caveats affect this test as well . both short and long term variability plague the reliability of the x - ray flux as a calibrator of the agn luminosity .",
    "equilibrium temperature arguments indicate that the dust emitting significantly at 10@xmath11 should be located within the central 110 pc ; therefore , excess of circumnuclear gas distributed over the 100 pc scale would not be probed by this indicator . finally , even the small aperture ( 5@xmath12 ) used in most of the groundbased mid - ir observations",
    "might include the contribution from a central compact starburst .",
    ". 3 reports the mean of the 10@xmath11/210kev luminosity ratio as a function of the bar strength for a sample of 19 sy1s .",
    "the 10@xmath11 data are from maiolino et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and from giuricin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; the x - ray data are from malaguti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , where we choose the datum closest in time to the mid - ir observation , to minimize long term variability effects .",
    "there is a tendency for barred systems to have a higher l@xmath13/l@xmath14 ratio , though the spread is large and the statistics are poor .",
    "the important result of our study is that the absorbing column density of type 2 seyferts strongly correlates with the presence of a stellar bar in their host galaxies . as discussed in the introduction , this result is not completely unexpected : stellar bars are very effective in driving gas into the central region , thus contributing to the obscuration of agns . on the other hand this gas should not play a major role in powering low luminosity agns , such as seyfert nuclei , given the lack of correlation between stellar bars and seyfert activity ( mcleod & rieke 1995 , mulchaey & regan 1997 , ho et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "as discussed in the former section , the fraction of bars in sy2s is only moderately higher ( at most by 20% ) than in sy1s .",
    "so , the gas accumulated in the central region by the stellar bar increases the column density outside the light cones , but it does not increase much the covering factor of the obscuring material .",
    "a possible explanation is that radiation and wind / jet pressure act to destroy or expel molecular clouds that happen to enter the light cones , while outside the light cones self - shading allows molecular clouds to survive and pile up along our line of sight .",
    "another possibility is that the inflowing gas concentrates at dynamical resonances ( eg .",
    "lindblad resonances ) forming obscuring tori .",
    "the solid angle that such tori subtend to the agn depends on their inner radius and thickness , that in turn depend on the dynamical and kinematical properties of the nuclear region , but are relatively independent of the amount of gas in the torus ( if the gas self  gravity is significant the torus would flatten , thus actually reducing its covering solid angle ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the n@xmath0 through the torus depends linearly on its mass .",
    "our result has also important implications on the scales over which the obscuring material is distributed .",
    "large scale stellar bars can transport gas into the central few 100 pc , but they exert little influence on the gas dynamics on smaller nuclear scales . as a consequence , a first interpretation of our bar ",
    "n@xmath0 link is that a large fraction of the obscuration in sy2s occurs on the 100 pc scale .",
    "this is in line with results obtained from hst images , that ascribe the obscuration of several sy2s nuclei to dust lanes or disks a few 100 pc in size ( eg . malkan et al .",
    "1998 ) . yet , one of the most interesting results of our study is that stellar bars appear very effective in making the obscuration of sy2 nuclei so high to be compton thick : more than 80% of compton thick sy2s are barred . as discussed in risaliti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , column densities larger than 10@xmath15 are unlikely to be distributed on the 100 pc scale , since the implied nuclear gas mass would exceed the total dynamical mass in the same region for several objects .",
    "this consideration generally constrains most of the compton thick gas to be located within a few 10 pc from the nucleus . on the other hand , on these small scales",
    "the gas dynamics is expected to be little affected by the non - axisymmetric potential of a stellar bar in the host galaxy .",
    "the connection between large stellar bars and compton thickness of sy2s thus requires some mechanism to link the dynamics on these different scales .",
    "shlosman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) proposed that if the large scale stellar bar collects in the central region a mass of gas that is a significant fraction of the dynamical mass , then the gaseous disk might become dynamically unstable and form a gaseous bar that could drive gas further into the nuclear region .",
    "a nuclear gaseous bar has been recently discovered in the nearby circinus galaxy ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998b ) , that hosts a compton thick seyfert 2 nucleus , in agreement with expectations .",
    "ironically , this galaxy has been classified as non - barred in the rc3 catalog ; however the fact that it is edge on and located in the galactic plane ( where crowding and patchy extinction confuse the large scale morphology ) might have prevented the identification of a large scale stellar bar . alternatively , nested secondary _",
    "stellar _ bars have also been observed in several galaxies and also in seyfert galaxies ( mulchaey & regan 1997 ) , and are thought to be more stable ( friedli & martinet 1993 ) .",
    "an encouraging result in this direction is that the only two sy2s showing evidence for an inner secondary stellar bar and for which the n@xmath0 has been estimated are actually heavily obscured ( see tab .",
    "however the opposite is not true : 5 other compton thick sy2s imaged in the near ",
    "ir by mulchaey et al .",
    "( 1997 ) do not show evidence for inner bars , though the limited angular resolution might have prevented their detection .",
