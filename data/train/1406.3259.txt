    "_ high - throughput quantum - mechanics _ ( htqm ) computation of materials properties by _ ab initio _ methods has become the foundation of an effective approach to materials design , discovery and characterization @xcite .",
    "this data - driven approach to materials science currently presents the most promising path to the development of advanced technological materials that could solve or mitigate important social and economic challenges of the 21st century @xcite . in order for this approach to be successful",
    ", however , one needs the confluence of three key factors : * i. * improved computational methods and tools ; * ii . * greater computational power ; and * iii .",
    "* heightened awareness of the power of extensive databases in science@xcite . while the last two are driven by technological advances in computing and research and development needs ,",
    "the development of improved computational tools appropriate for htqm frameworks is a grand challenge that is still in need of considerable advances .",
    "most htqm infrastructures rely on the predictive capability of density functional theory ( dft ) , the method of choice for the first principles study of materials properties . however , despite the enormous success of dft in describing many physical properties of real systems , its limitations in describing correctly the electronic band structure of insulators are well known .",
    "the method is limited by the presence of an unknown correlation term that represents the difference between the true energy of the many - body system of the electrons and the approximate energy that we can compute .",
    "the common approximations based on a nearly - homogeneous - electron - gas treatment of the electron density , the local - density ( lda ) and generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) , are extremely successful in the description of many physical properties of materials , but dramatically underestimate the electron energy gap in insulators and semiconductors and thus fail to satisfactorily describe the electronic properties of these systems .",
    "higher order levels of theory that are able to predict with great accuracy the energy gaps exist ( the @xmath1 approximation@xcite and dynamical mean - field theory@xcite , among others ) but they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for extensive high - throughput materials characterization @xcite , even when machine learning methods are employed to simplify the complexity of the task especially when seeking for new materials systems @xcite . in order to address the energy gap problem at a lower computational cost the two most common corrections to traditional local and non - local approximations to dft are `` hybrid functionals '' and dft+@xmath2 .",
    "both approaches aim to reduce at some level the self - interaction error @xcite and introduce the derivative discontinuity in the exchange - correlation functional@xcite responsible for the underestimation of the energy gap@xcite .",
    "hybrid functionals are based on the idea of computing the exact exchange energy from the kohn - sham wavefunctions and to mix it with the ( semi)local approximation of exchange energy of dft@xcite .",
    "the method is very successful in predicting the energy gap with good accuracy and points to the importance of introducing some degree of exact exchange in traditional dft for a proper description of the electronic structure .",
    "however , the level of mixing is not determined from first principles , so the method suffers of some level of empiricism and , even after the introduction of range separated functionals suitable for periodic system calculations@xcite , it is more computationally demanding than lda or gga .",
    "the treatment of systems with strongly localized(correlated ) electrons is another outstanding issue that limits the predictive power of ( semi)local approximations to dft for systems where localization is important , such as transition metal insulators , and directly impacts the energy gap problem .",
    "the dft+@xmath2 method introduced by liechtenstein and anisimov @xcite aims at preserving the information of orbital localization from being averaged out as in lda or gga in order to improve the description of the band structure with a very modest increase in computational effort . since in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with an extension of this approach , let us discuss its guiding principles in some detail .    within the dft+@xmath2 ansatz",
    ", localized states @xmath3 largely retain their atomic nature and , therefore , can be expanded in term of an atomic - orbital basis set @xmath4 .",
    "the coulomb and exchange energy associated with these states is explicitly evaluated using the hartree - fock ( hf ) framework via electron repulsion integrals ( eri , also know as two - electron integrals ) with a screened ( renormalized ) coulomb interaction @xmath5 and added to the original dft energy after the removal of double counting terms in the energy expansion , in a spirit similar to the hybrid functionals approach .",
    "the hf coulomb and exchange energy of the localized states is given by @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spin density matrix @xmath7 of the atomic orbitals @xmath8 .",
    "this equation can be simplified via the introduction of the phenomenological parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 that describe the on - site hubbard - like interactions as expressed by dudarev _",
    "@xcite : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the spin occupation number of the atomic orbital @xmath8 . from the equations above",
    ", it clearly follows that the new parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , contain the information of all the eris in an averaged scenario . in physical terms",
    ", @xmath9 is the strong correlation experienced between localized electrons  only subtly coupled to the sea of extended states in which they live .",
    "thus , the most akin definition of @xmath9 ( for the non - spin - polarized case ) is the average @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number of localized states @xmath3 , and @xmath15 for @xmath16 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the exchange contribution , @xmath10 , is given by a similar average @xcite .",
    "although the physical picture is clear , an unambiguous procedure for computing @xmath17 from _ ab - initio _ does not exist .",

    "the former computes the screened coulomb interaction as the bare coulomb interaction renormalized by the inverse dielectric function , which is calculated using the random phase approximation .",
    "the latter circumvents the ambiguity of @xmath5 by indirectly determining @xmath9 as the second derivative of the total energy with respect to constrained variations of the atomic charge @xmath18 of the chosen hubbard center @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the total energy of a supercell large enough to converge to the bulk environment for the atom @xmath19 .",

    "basis , this is enforced by suppressing the hopping integrals to prevent charge rehybridization or transfer with its environment @xcite and in the case of plane - wave dft by subtracting a correcting term from @xmath22 as given in ref .  .",
    "this method has been widely used for open - shell systems ; nonetheless , the numerical reliability becomes challenging for closed - shell systems where the localized bands are completely full , thus exhibiting very small response to the linear perturbation @xcite .    regarding the representation of the @xmath23 states , _",

    "recently , maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) , an invariant choice suitable for plane - wave calculations , have also been employed @xcite . by construction ,",
    "these functions are associated with a given angular momentum ( @xmath28 ) and the direct correspondence makes them convenient to represent the localized @xmath24 or @xmath25 electrons .",

    "the localized orbitals are implicitly taken as a linear combinations the basis functions of interest , @xmath30 , with the expansion coefficients included in the renormalized density matrix coming directly from the solution of the kohn - sham equations projected onto the localized basis of choice ( see below ) ;    _ iii _ ) a plane - wave basis set is the natural choice for dft calculations of periodic systems , but on - site hf energies are more efficiently computed in a localized basis set .",
