    "k3 surfaces are ubiquitous in string theory compactifications  @xcite . as the unique calabi - yau manifolds of complex dimension 2 , they are the simplest compact special holonomy manifolds , and the simplest manifolds other than tori admitting the covariantly constant spinors required for low energy supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "k3 surfaces also feature prominently in string duality  @xcite .",
    "for example , in a chain of dualities related by circle reduction , f - theory on k3 is dual to the @xmath2 heterotic string on @xmath3 , m - theory on k3 is dual to the heterotic or type i string on @xmath1 , and type iia string theory on k3 is dual to the heterotic or type i string on @xmath4 .",
    "fiberwise application of this duality relates m - theory on manifolds of @xmath5 holonomy to the heterotic or type i string on calabi - yau 3-folds  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the present work , and the duality of interest here , is the lift from type iia string theory on the @xmath0 orientifold to m - theory on k3 . here",
    "@xmath0 is the orientifold obtained from type i on @xmath1 after t - duality with respect to all three torus isometries .",
    "this duality relates the conventional compactification of m - theory on k3 to a simple iia warped compactification , where the warping is due to the 16 d6-branes and 8 o6-planes of @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is part of a larger investigation , whose overall goal is to elucidate the procedure for kaluza - klein reduction of warped compactifications via duality to standard compactifications .",
    "a secondary goal along the way , is to learn about compactification on manifolds of @xmath6 structure .",
    "virtually all phenomenologically relevant string theory compactifications are of warped type , in which the overall scale factor of 4d spacetime varies over the internal dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this feature modifies 4d mass scales and couplings , and naturally realizes the randall - sundrum approach to the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "a long standing obstacle to quantitative prediction has been our incomplete understanding of the analog of standard kaluza - klein reduction for warped compactification .",
    "warped kaluza - klein reduction was first studied in refs .",

    ", this paper provides a review of the geometry of k3 surfaces emphasizing the tools that will be useful for the duality , of which , a novel feature is the role of an approximate k3 metric exactly dual to the classical supergravity description of @xmath0 . at the level of the tree - level type iia supergravity description of @xmath0 , the lift to m - theory gives a `` first - order '' metric on k3 of gibbons - hawking  @xcite form , through which it is possible to study the differential geometry of k3 more explicitly than is generally the case for calabi - yau manifolds . for physicists , differential geometry ,",
    "the language of general relativity , is more intuitive than algebraic geometry , however , exact calabi - yau metrics are not known except in orbifold limits .",
    "therefore , one is usually led to an algebro - geometric description , in which the quantities appearing in the local supergravity equations  frame , metric , deformations , harmonic forms , khler form  are analyzed abstractly rather than explicitly . in contrast",
    ", k3 in the gibbons - hawking approximation provides a model in which one can manipulate all of the moving parts of k3 at the level of explicitness that one would really like .",
    "there is an explicit metric whose components are simply defined functions of quantities @xmath7 parametrizing an @xmath8 coset , in addition to overall scaling from the volume modulus @xmath9 .",
    "one can write down the harmonic forms in this metric , and see explicitly how they vary with the moduli .",
    "one can write down a frame and a triple of hyperkhler 2-forms and see that all three forms are closed , thus showing that there is no torsion , and that the metric connection has @xmath6 holonomy .",
    "finally , one can study the metric on the metric moduli space , and here too , there is an explicit example of a novel phenomenon .",
    "the diffeomorphism invariant moduli space metric obtained using the formalism of compensators agrees with the naive moduli space metric from direct dimensional reduction .",
    "we restrict the scope of this paper to the geometry of k3 and the duality between a family of m - theory vacua on k3 and family of iia vacua on @xmath0 .",
    "we steer clear of 7d effective field theory questions , in which the moduli promoted from _",
    "parameters _ labeling the families to _ fields _ depending on the noncompact dimensions of spacetime .",
    "the effective field theory analysis will appear in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the warped compactification ansatz for type iia on @xmath0 is derived from the standard compactification ansatz for m - theory on k3 , at the level of the tree level iia supergravity description .",
    "all of this is a warm - up for ref .",
    "@xcite , in which we treat a similar duality  @xcite relating the @xmath10 type iib orientifold with @xmath11 flux to a class of purely geometry type iia calabi - yau compactifications .",
    "the latter will allow us to deduce the warped dimensional reduction procedure for @xmath10 from that for the conventional calabi - yau dual .    as an interesting vista along the way to this goal",
    ", we observe in ref .",
    "@xcite that the class of calabi - yau manifolds arising in the duality of the previous paragraph are not only manifolds of @xmath12 holonony , but also manifolds of @xmath6 structure .",
    "that is , there exists a connection with torsion whose holonomy group is further restricted from @xmath12 to @xmath6 . just as the dual choice of flux in the type iib @xmath10 dual",
    "spontaneously breaks an @xmath13 low energy field theory to @xmath11  @xcite , the @xmath6 structure gives the iia calabi - yau compactification an @xmath13 effective field theory in which the topology spontaneously breaks the supersymmetry to @xmath11 .",
