    "the production of jets of hadrons in all kinds of high - energy collisions is dramatic evidence of the pointlike substructure of matter .",
    "qcd predictions of the rates of production of different numbers of jets are well confirmed and provide good measurements of the fundamental coupling @xmath2 .",
    "the latest triumph in this respect is the calculation of the 5-jet rate in @xmath0 annihilation to next - to - leading order , i.e.  @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : y45nlo ] shows that calculation compared to data from the aleph experiment at lep  @xcite .",
    "the observable shown is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the value of the jet resolution parameter at which five jets are just resolved using the @xmath6-jet algorithm@xcite .",
    "there is good agreement over the range shown , and the uncertainty in the prediction is remarkably small considering this quantity is @xmath7 at leading order .",
    "the value of the strong coupling obtained from the nlo fit to the region @xmath8 is ( m_z ) = 0.1156^+0.0041_-0.0034 , which is in good agreement with the world average value obtained from other observables .",
    "however , looking at a wider range of @xmath5 values , fig .",
    "[ fig : y45 ] , we see that the region used in the nlo fit represents only a small part of the full distribution .",
    "most events have @xmath9 , with a distribution that turns over at @xmath10 , whereas the fixed - order prediction continues to rise more and more rapidly with increasing @xmath11 ( note the logarithmic vertical scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : y45nlo ] ) .",
    "what this means physically is that most events have a two - jet structure that can only be resolved into five jets by using a high - resolution jet algorithm .",
    "however , it is important to understand this internal structure of the jets as well as possible , for example to search for highly - boosted new particles whose decays might look like or be hiding inside qcd jets . to achieve better understanding",
    "we need progress on two fronts :    1 .",
    "calculations of jet substructure in the region beyond the reach of fixed - order perturbation theory ; 2 .",
    "jet algorithms that probe jets in a way that reveals their substructure in informative ways .",
    "although the era of lep physics is past , @xmath12 annihilation can still serve as a good testing ground for ideas on both these topics , as i hope to illustrate in the following sections .",
    "the reason for the breakdown of fixed - order predictions at high @xmath11 , where most of the data lie , is that qcd matrix elements have soft and collinear singularities that give rise to logarithmic enhancement of higher - order contributions .",
    "in fact there are up to two factors of @xmath11 for every extra power of @xmath2 , so if the coefficient were unity we would expect a breakdown at @xmath13 .",
    "as we shall see , in fact the coefficient is more like @xmath14 , which does indeed imply a breakdown at @xmath15 .",
    "ideally we would like to be able to sum these enhanced terms to all orders in a closed form that would exhibit the turnover in the distribution , as is the case for several other @xmath12 observables .",
    "ccl @xmath16 & = & @xmath17 + @xmath18 & = & @xmath19 + @xmath20 & = & @xmath21 + @xmath22 & = & @xmath23 + @xmath24 & = & @xmath25 + @xmath26 & = & @xmath27 + @xmath28 & = & @xmath29 +   + @xmath30 & = & @xmath31 + @xmath32 & = & @xmath33 + @xmath34 & = & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & = & @xmath37 + @xmath38 & = & @xmath39 + @xmath40 & = & @xmath41 + @xmath42 & = & @xmath43 +   + @xmath44 & = & @xmath45 + @xmath46 & = & @xmath47 + @xmath48 & = & @xmath49 + @xmath50 & = & @xmath51 + @xmath52 & = & @xmath53 +   + @xmath54 & = & @xmath55 + @xmath56 & = & @xmath57 + @xmath58 & = & @xmath59    in ref .",
    "@xcite we wrote down integral equations for generating functions that can be used to compute the leading and next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) in jet cross sections to any order .",
    "table  [ tab : rn ] shows the results up to @xmath7 .",
    "these equations are for the jet fraction @xmath60 , which is the fraction of events that have precisely @xmath61 jets at resolution @xmath62 .",
    "the differential jet rates , like the one in figs .  [ fig : y45nlo ] and [ fig : y45 ] , are obtained from them by differentiating : [ eq : ykk ] 1_tot = -_n = k^.|_=y_k-1,k .",
    "thus to nll accuracy , in the notation of table  [ tab : rn ] , [ eq : y45nll ] 1_tot = ( 6r_56 l_45 ^ 5 + 5r_55 l_45 ^ 4 ) + o(^4 )",
    ". however , such fixed - order nll predictions are not much use as they are invalid when @xmath11 is not large and need to be resummed when it is large . indeed , since @xmath63 while ( for @xmath64 flavours ) @xmath65 , the prediction ( [ eq : y45nll ] ) is actually negative for @xmath66 .    the leading double - logarithmic ` abelian '",
    "terms , i.e.  those proportional to @xmath67 , resum to an exponential form : [ eq : rnab ] r_n+2^(ab ) ~1n!(12 ac_fl^2)^n ( -12 ac_fl^2 ) this gives the correct qualitative features of the differential distribution ( [ eq : ykk ] ) at large @xmath68 , but the numerical values are wrong , e.g.   the turn - over occurs at @xmath69 .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the comparable non - abelian terms and large nll corrections .",
    "the easiest way to resum the enhanced terms more completely is to encode them in a parton shower simulation . by this",
    "i mean a sequential @xmath70 parton branching process with branching probabilities of the form [ eq : dp ] dp(abc)= q p_ba(z)dz where @xmath71 is an ordered evolution variable , @xmath72 measures the energy fraction in the branching , @xmath73 is the corresponding dglap splitting function and the argument @xmath74 of @xmath2 is a function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in general .",
    "the integral equations of ref .",
    "@xcite are equivalent to such a process with the following simple properties : the evolution variable is the angle of branching and @xmath74 is the relative transverse momentum .    the @xcite event generator results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : y45 ] are based on a parton shower with precisely these properties .",
    "pythia@xcite also has a parton shower which , although organized in a different way , ought to be equivalent .",
    "ariadne@xcite is based on a different approach involving colour dipoles rather than partons . ) and not to dipole showers . ]",
    "all the generators correctly reproduce the main features of the distribution , in particular the turn - over at @xmath75 .",
    "it should be said that the event generators include a lot of additional refinements , such as matching to fixed - order matrix elements at low @xmath11 and modelling of hadronization .",
    "in particular the latter has quite a strong effect at lep energies and introduces free parameters which can be tuned to the data .",
    "nevertheless a parton shower , or equivalent , with the correct features is an essential component for reliable extrapolation to the higher energies and different processes encountered at the lhc .",
    "angular ordering is not the most convenient organization of the parton shower : physical quantities such as transverse momenta and jet masses have to be reconstructed from the shower variables",
    ". it would also be preferable to generate the hardest ( highest transverse momentum ) branchings first , which would make matching to fixed - order matrix elements@xcite and nlo improvements@xcite simpler .",
    "these considerations lead us to look at what happens if we order the shower in relative transverse momentum ( @xmath76 ) rather than angle .",
    "unfortunately with simple @xmath76-ordering things start to go wrong even at the leading - log level as soon as gluon branching is involved . instead of the results in table  [ tab : rn ] for the ll coefficients in the 4-jet and 5-jet fractions , r_44 & = & c_f^2/8 + c_f c_a/48 , + r_56 & = & c_f^3 /48",

    "we could try to fix things up by ordering in @xmath76 and rejecting branchings that are disordered in angle . for the 4-jet rate this cures the problem with gluon branching , fig .",
    "[ fig : fourjets](c ) , but spoils the result for sequential quark branching , fig .",
    "[ fig : fourjets](b ) , while for the 5-jet fraction everything is wrong : r^(p_t,)_44 & = & 5c_f^2/48 + c_fc_a/48 , + r^(p_t,)_56 & = & 7c_f^3/576 + 13c_f^2c_a/1440 + c_fc_a^2/960 .    to see what is going wrong ,",
    "consider the @xmath77 integration regions for diagrams [ fig : fourjets](b ) and ( c ) , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztheta ] . here",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 are the ( smaller ) gluon energy fractions and opening angles in successive branchings , and @xmath80 .",
    "thus in diagram [ fig : fourjets](b ) , @xmath76-ordering corresponds to @xmath81 , giving the integration region a+b .",
    "however , the correct region is the angular - ordered one a+c .",
    "if we impose angular ordering after @xmath76-ordering , we get only a , i.e.  a deficit in the coefficient of @xmath82 .",
    "now it happens that for this diagram the inclusion of region b compensates for the loss of c as far as the logarithms are concerned , so in this case @xmath76-ordering alone gives the same result as angular ordering .",
    "i will come back to this point later .    in diagram",
    "[ fig : fourjets](c ) , @xmath76-ordering corresponds to @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84 , as shown on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztheta ] .",
    "the region c has disappeared and the @xmath76-ordered region a+b is just too large , giving an enhanced coefficient of @xmath85 . however , because region c is not there , imposing angular ordering after @xmath76-ordering is equivalent to simply angular ordering , giving the correct region a and hence the correct coefficient of @xmath85 .",
    "so perhaps the correct prescription for a @xmath76-ordered shower is to angular - order only the @xmath86 vertices ?",
    "this corrects the 4-jet rate but in the 5-jet rate the coefficient of @xmath87 is too small : r^(p_t , gg)_44 & = & c_f^2/8 + c_f c_a/48 , + r^(p_t , gg)_56 & = & c_f^3/48 + c_f^2c_a/96 + c_fc_a^2/960 .",
    "however , the reason for this is the same as before : if the gluon that branches a second time in fig .",
    "[ fig : fivejets](f ) is the harder one coming from the first gluon branching , the situation is as on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztheta ] , and we should not angular - order the second gluon branching .    in summary , the way to get",
    "the correct ll ( and nll ) jet fractions , to all orders , from a @xmath76-ordered parton shower is to enforce angular ordering with respect to the branching at which each parton was `` created '' , where this means the branching at which it was the softer of the two produced  @xcite . more precisely , one should veto branchings that are disordered in angle with respect to their `` creation '' .",
    "technically , a veto means not branching but resetting the @xmath76 scale as if the branching had occurred .",
    "this is a common kind of procedure in parton shower generators anyway , for example to correct for flavour thresholds or higher orders in the running coupling .",
    "this looks like a better way to do parton shower event generation . with @xmath76-ordering one can more easily correct the prediction to nlo , or indeed to any fixed order in @xmath2 in principle .",
    "one only has to correct the first few steps in the shower .",
    "unfortunately there is a catch .",
    "everything works fine at the parton level as far as the distribution in phase space is concerned , but the colour structure of the partonic final state is not correct .",
    "coming back to fig .",
    "[ fig : ztheta ] ( left ) , we see that , compared to angular ordering , @xmath76-ordering includes a region of softer , wide - angle gluon emission , b , in place of a region of harder , more collinear emission , c. what this means is that gluon radiation is moved around within the shower , the amount and distribution remaining the same .",
    "this is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : colstru ] , where for simplicity we show the large-@xmath88 approximation , as used for hadronization in event generators . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colstru](a ) , angular ordering assigns a soft , wide - angle gluon , actually emitted coherently by partons @xmath89 and @xmath90 , to the parent parton @xmath91 , which is reasonable because @xmath91 does have the coherent sum of the colour charges of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath76-ordering assigns this gluon to the harder of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , in this case @xmath90 , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : colstru](b ) . that is reasonable",
    "as far as the momenta are concerned , but it spoils the colour structure by treating @xmath90 as the colour source and neglecting the coherent contribution of @xmath89 .",
    "the colour structure matters when one wants to interface the parton shower to a non - perturbative hadronization model . in the cluster model used by ,",
    "colour - singlet clusters are formed by splitting gluons at the end of the shower into @xmath92 pairs .",
    "thus in the angular - ordered fig .",
    "[ fig : colstru](a ) the clusters connect @xmath93 and @xmath94 , while in @xmath76-ordered fig .",
    "[ fig : colstru](b ) they connect @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "similarly in the pythia string hadronization model , the string connects @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : colstru](a ) but @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig : colstru](b ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "an angular - ordered parton shower sums the ll and nll enhanced terms and provides partonic final states with colour structure consistent with qcd coherence .",
    "this is good for hadronization models but not so convenient for reconstruction of kinematics or for systematic improvement away from the soft and collinear regions .",
    "a @xmath76-ordered shower is better in those respects and , with the right angular veto procedure , can give the correct nll jet fractions .",
    "however the colour structure then needs to be reconfigured according to angular ordering before the partonic final state can be hadronized .",
    "recall that the @xmath6-algorithm for @xmath12 annihilation  @xcite is defined in terms of the resolution variable y_ij = 2\\{e_i^2,e_j^2}(1-_ij)/q^2 , where @xmath99 are the energies of final - state objects @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the angle between their momenta and @xmath103 is the centre - of - mass energy . the two objects with the smallest value of @xmath104 are combined into one , this is repeated until all @xmath105 , and the remaining objects are called jets . for the purpose of counting large logarithms of @xmath62 ,",
    "we can write this in the small - angle approximation _ ij = \\{e_i , e_j}_ij / q > , where as before @xmath80 .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is just one of a continuum of possible jet algorithms with resolution variable _",
    "ij = \\{e^p_i , e^p_j}_ij / q^p , where @xmath106 can be any positive or negative number .",
    "in particular @xmath107 defines the resolution for the @xmath12 analogue of the anti-@xmath6 algorithm@xcite , which has the advantage that objects are combined starting with those that have the highest energy rather than the lowest .",
    "when @xmath108 a supplementary condition is needed , otherwise infinitely soft emissions would be resolved .",
    "for anti-@xmath6 we define _ ij & = & \\{q / e_i , q / e_j}_ij , + _ i & = & q / e_i",
    ". then if the smallest of the set of @xmath109 is an @xmath110 , we remove @xmath100 from the list of objects to be recombined , and if @xmath111 we call it a jet .",
    "otherwise we just throw it away .",
    "thus every jet has an energy greater than @xmath112 and is separated from other jets by an angle greater than @xmath113 .",
    "the resulting ll coefficients in the 4- and 5-jet fractions are r^anti_44 & = & c_f^2/2 + c_f c_a/8 , + r^anti_56 & = & c_f^3/6 + c_f^2c_a/8 + c_fc_a^2/48 , where as before the large logarithm is defined as @xmath114 .",
    "we could introduce an angular resolution @xmath115 different from the energy resolution @xmath113 by multiplying @xmath116 by @xmath117 .",
    "this would just replace @xmath118 by @xmath119 .",
    "it is easy to see that leading double - logarithmic abelian terms in the anti-@xmath6 jet rates resum to an exponential form with twice the exponent of the @xmath6 rates ( [ eq : rnab ] ) : [ eq : rnabanti ] r_n+2^(anti , ab ) ~1n!(ac_fl^2)^n ( -ac_fl^2 ) it should also be possible to resum the non - abelian and nll terms using techniques like those of ref .",
    "although the era of high - energy @xmath12 collider experiments is past , at least for a while , it is helpful to study how our tools for analysing hadronic final states perform in the cleaner environment of the annihilation process .",
    "the @xmath6-jet algorithm has proven useful in all kinds of processes and the @xmath12 jet rates defined in this way are a good place to test alternative resummation methods , particular those involving parton showers ordered in different ways .",
    "we have seen that angular - ordered and @xmath76-ordered showers can both be arranged to resum the leading and next - to - leading logarithms of the @xmath6-jet resolution @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath76-ordering option is good for matching to fixed - order calculations but causes some difficulties in matching to hadronization models at low scales , owing to its disordered colour structure .",
    "the rather different anti-@xmath6 algorithm has been adopted as the preferred tool for jet finding at the lhc .",
    "an analogous @xmath12 algorithm can be defined and we saw that it has a simple pattern of leading logarithms , which should be amenable to resummation using techniques similar to those applied to the @xmath6 algorithm .",
    "it is a pleasure to recall and acknowledge conversations with volodya gribov in many places during the all - too - brief times we spent together .",
    "i am also indebted to stefano catani , gavin salam and mike seymour for helpful comments and discussions ."
