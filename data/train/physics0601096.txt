    "traffic congestion is a severe problem on european freeways . according to a study of the european commission @xcite ,",
    "its impact amounts to 0.5% of the gross national product and will increase even up to 1% in the year 2010 . since building new infrastructure is no longer an appropriate option in most ( western ) countries , there are many approaches towards a more effective road usage and a more intelligent way of increasing the capacity of the road network .",
    "examples of advanced traffic control systems are , e.g. , intelligent speed limits , adaptive ramp metering , or dynamic routing .",
    "these examples are based on a centralized traffic management , which controls the operation and the response to a given traffic situation . in this contribution , we focus on a local strategy based on autonomous vehicles , which are equipped with adaptive cruise control ( acc ) systems .",
    "the motivation is that a jam - avoiding driving strategy of these automated vehicles might also help to increase the road capacity and thus decrease traffic congestion .",
    "moreover , acc systems become commercially available to an increasing number of vehicle types .",
    "an acc system is able to detect and to track the vehicle ahead , measuring the actual distance and speed difference .",
    "together with the own speed , these input data allow the system to calculate the required acceleration or deceleration to maintain a selected time headway , to reach a desired velocity , or to prevent a rear - end collision .",
    "it should be emphasized that acc systems control the longitudinal driving task .",
    "merging , lane changing or gap - creation for other vehicles still needs the intervention of the driver .",
    "acc systems promise a gain in comfort and safety in applicable driving situations , but they are not yet applied in congested traffic conditions .",
    "the next generation of acc will successfully extend the application range to all speed ranges and most traffic situations on freeways including stop - and - go traffic .",
    "this leads to the question : in which way does a growing market penetration of acc - equipped vehicles influence the capacity and stability of traffic flow ?",
    "although there is considerable research on this topic @xcite , there is even no clarity up to now about the sign of the effect .",
    "some investigations predict a positive effect @xcite , while others are more pessimistic @xcite .",
    "the contribution is organized as follows : we start with a discussion of modeling issues concerning the description of human vs. automated driving and pinpoint the differences between acc - driven vehicles and human drivers . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vla ] , we will model three acc driving styles , which are explicitly designed to increase the dynamic capacity and traffic stability by varying the individual driving behavior . since the impact on the traffic dynamics could solely be answered by means of traffic simulations , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we perform a simulation study of mixed freeway traffic with a variable percentage of acc vehicles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diss ] , we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "most microscopic traffic models describe the acceleration and deceleration of each individual driver - vehicle unit as a function of the distance and velocity difference to the vehicle in front and on the own velocity @xcite .",
    "some of these car - following models have been successful to reproducing the characteristic features of macroscopic traffic phenomena such as traffic breakdowns , the scattering in the fundamental diagram , traffic instabilities , and the propagation of stop - and - go waves or other patterns of congested traffic . while these collective phenomena can be described by macroscopic , fluid - dynamic traffic models as well @xcite , microscopic models are more appropriate to cope with the heterogeneity of mixed traffic , e.g. , by representing individual driver - vehicle units by different parameter sets or even by different models .    remarkably , the input quantities of car - following models are exactly those of an acc system . as in microscopic models ,",
    "the acc controller unit calculates the acceleration with a negligible response time .",
    "therefore , one might state that car - following models describe acc systems more accurately than human drivers despite of their intention to reproduce the traffic dynamics of human driving behavior .",
    "thus , the question arises , how to take into account the _ human _ aspects of driving for a realistic description of the traffic dynamics .",
    "the nature of human driving is apparently more complex .",
    "first of all , the _ finite reaction time _ of humans results in a delayed response towards the traffic situation .",
    "furthermore , human drivers have to cope with imperfect estimation capabilities resulting in _ perception errors _ and _ limited attention spans_. these destabilizing influences alone would lead to a more unsafe driving and a high number of accidents if the reaction time reached the order of the time headway .",
    "but in day - to - day situations the contrary is observed : in dense ( not yet congested ) traffic , the modal value of the time headway distribution on german or dutch freeways ( i.e. , the value where it reaches its maximum ) is around 0.9  s @xcite , which is of the same order of typical reaction times @xcite .",
    "moreover , single - vehicle data for german freeways @xcite indicate that some drivers even drive at headways as low as 0.3 s , which is below the reaction time by a factor of at least 2 - 3 even for a very attentive driver . for principal reasons ,",
    "therefore , safe driving is not possible in this case when considering only one vehicle in front .",
    "this suggests that human drivers achieve additional stability and safety by scanning the traffic situation _ several vehicles ahead _ and by _ anticipating _ future traffic situations .",
    "the question is , how this behavior affects the overall driving behavior and performance with respect to acc - like driving mimicked by car - following models .",
    "do the stabilizing effects ( such as anticipation ) or the destabilizing effects ( such as reaction times and estimation errors ) dominate , or do they effectively cancel out each other ? the _ human driver model _ ( hdm ) @xcite extends the car - following modeling approach by explicitly taking into account reaction times , perception errors , spatial anticipation ( more than one vehicle ahead ) and temporal anticipation ( extrapolating the future traffic situation ) .",
    "it turns out that the destabilizing effects of reaction times and estimation errors can be compensated for by spatial and temporal anticipation @xcite .",
    "one obtains essentially the same longitudinal dynamics , which explains the good performance of the simpler , acc - like car - following models .",
    "thus , for the sake of simplicity , we model both automated acc - driving and human driving with the same microscopic traffic model , but differentiate the driving strategies by different parameter sets .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , both human drivers and acc - controlled vehicles are effectively described by the car - following model approach . here , we will use the _ intelligent driver model _ ( idm ) @xcite , according to which the acceleration of each vehicle @xmath0 is a continuous function of the velocity @xmath1 , the net distance gap @xmath2 , and the velocity difference ( approaching rate ) @xmath3 to the leading vehicle : @xmath4.\\ ] ] the deceleration term depends on the ratio between the effective desired minimum gap @xmath5 and the actual gap @xmath6 .",
    "the minimum distance @xmath7 in congested traffic is significant for low velocities only .",
    "the dominating term in stationary traffic is @xmath8 , which corresponds to following the leading vehicle with a constant safe time headway @xmath9 .",
    "the last term is only active in non - stationary traffic and implements an accident - free , intelligent driving behavior including a braking strategy that , in nearly all situations , limits braking decelerations to the comfortable deceleration @xmath10 .",
    "the idm guarantees crash - free driving .",
    "the parameters for the simulations are given in table  [ tab : idm ] .    in order to design a jam - avoiding behavior for the acc vehicles ,",
    "we modify the acc model parameters .",
    "the ( average ) time headway has a direct relation to the maximum ( static ) road capacity : neglecting the length of vehicles leads to the approximative relationship @xmath11 between the flow @xmath12 and the headway @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : qmax ] ) below ) . the crucial parameter",
    "controlling the capacity is , therefore , the safe time headway , which is an explicit parameter of the idm .",
    "moreover , the system performance is not only determined by the time headway distribution , but also depends on the _ stability _ of traffic flow .",
    "an acc driving behavior aiming at increasing the traffic performance should , therefore , additionally consider a driving strategy which is able to stabilize the traffic flow , e.g. by a faster dynamic adaptation to the new traffic situation .",
    "the stability is mainly affected by the idm parameters maximum acceleration and desired deceleration , see @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will investigate the potentials of three different parameter sets for jam - avoiding driving behavior , varying the idm parameters @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 . in order to refer to the values given in table  [ tab : idm ] , we express the parameter changes by simple multipliers .",
    "for example , @xmath14 represents an increased acc parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath13 is the value listed in table  [ tab : idm ] .    1 .",
    "the reduction of the time headway @xmath9 by a factor @xmath16 has a positive impact on the capacity .",
    "the other model parameters of table  [ tab : idm ] remain unchanged , i.e. , in particular , @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   besides setting @xmath16 , we increase the desired acceleration by choosing @xmath14 . the faster acceleration towards the desired velocity increases the traffic stability .",
    "the additional reduction of the desired deceleration by @xmath18 corresponds to a more cautious and more anticipative driving style .",
    "this behavior also increases the stability .",
    ".[tab : idm]model parameters of the _ intelligent driver model _ ( idm ) used in our simulations .",
    "the vehicle length is 5  m. in order to model jam - avoiding acc strategies , we modify the safe time headway parameter @xmath9 , the maximum acceleration @xmath13 and the desired deceleration @xmath10 by multipliers @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively . [",

    "adaptive cruise control ( acc ) systems are already available on the market .",
    "the next generations of acc systems will extend their range of applicability to all speeds , and it is assumed that their spreading will grow in the future . in this contribution , by means of microscopic traffic simulations we have investigated the impact that an automated longitudinal driving control of acc systems based on the intelligent driver model ( idm ) is expected to have on the traffic dynamics .",
    "acc systems are closely related to car - following models as their reaction is restricted to a leading vehicle . moreover , we have explained why such a car - following approach also captures the main aspects of longitudinal driver behavior so well .",
    "we , therefore , expect that both acc systems and human driver behavior will mix consistently in future traffic flows although the driving operation is fundamentally different .",
    "the equipment level of acc systems provides an interesting option to enhance the traffic performance by automated driving strategies . in order to analyze the potentials ,",
    "we have studied acc driving styles , which are explicitly designed to increase the capacity and stability of traffic flows .",
    "we have varied the percentage of acc vehicles and found that already a small proportion of acc vehicles , which implies a marginally increased free and dynamic capacity , leads to a drastic reduction of traffic congestion .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that , capacity and stability do have similar importance for the traffic dynamics .",
    "we have assumed that the acc systems have a more jam - avoiding driving style than the human drivers .",
    "one might additionally take into account inefficient human behavior when traffic gets denser and the time headway increases with increasing local velocity variance @xcite . in this case , a constant time headway policy for automated driving is expected to improve the system performance even more .    up to now , acc systems are only optimized for the user s driving comfort and safety .",
    "in fact , present acc systems may have a negative influence on the system performance when their percentage becomes large .",
    "the design of acc strategies , which also consider their impact on traffic dynamics , will be crucial for the next acc generations .",
    "furthermore , we propose to implement an intelligent acc strategy that adapts the acc driving style _",
    "dynamically _ to the overall traffic situation . for example , in dense , but not yet congested traffic , a jam - avoiding parameter set could help to delay or suppress traffic breakdowns as shown in our simulations , while in free traffic a parameter set mimicking natural driver behavior may be applied instead .",
    "the respective traffic state could be autonomously detected by the vehicles using the history of their sensor data in combination with digital maps .",
    "moreover , inter - vehicle communication could contribute information about the traffic situation in the neigborhood , e.g. , by detecting the downstream front of a traffic jam @xcite .",
