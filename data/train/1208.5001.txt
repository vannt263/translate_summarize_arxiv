    "controlled manipulation of coherent quantum systems is a crucial requirement for quantum information technologies , can be exploited in ultrafast switches , and may allow the exploration of exotic regimes of quantum dynamics .",
    "an important example among solid - state systems is that of excitons in quantum dots,@xcite which provide discrete atomic - like transitions that can be manipulated using optical pulses .",
    "these transitions have been demonstrated experimentally to correspond to two - level systems , for which resonant optical excitation induces rabi oscillations.@xcite thus under pulsed excitation the number of excitons created oscillates with the pulse area : a pulse of the correct duration and intensity creates exactly one exciton in the quantum dot , while other pulses create superpositions of one- and no- exciton states .",
    "frequency - swept laser pulses have also been used to create single excitons in quantum dots , implementing the protocol of adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) , and allowing state manipulation in a way which is robust against fluctuations in the coupling strengths and transition energies of the dots.@xcite    a theoretical description of such coherent control experiments must capture both the dynamics of the driven quantum dot , and the scattering and decoherence introduced by the interaction between the dot and its environment . in particular , the coupling to acoustic phonons leads to dephasing of the rabi oscillations@xcite and limits the inversion in arp .",
    "@xcite ( optic phonons could play a role in arp with very intense , very short pulses,@xcite where the energy scales are comparable to the optic phonon energies , but we do not consider this regime here . ) the standard theoretical approach@xcite involves second - order perturbation theory in the phonon coupling , leading to an equation of motion for the reduced density operator of the dot .",
    "this equation involves an integral over all previous states of the dot , capturing the memory effects due to the finite bandwidth and response time of the environment .",
    "a frequently used approach to treating this type of non - markovian equation of motion is a form of markov approximation which reduces the equation to a time - local equation , with the effects of the phonons appearing as a constant lindblad form describing dephasing .",
    "such an equation would be valid under the assumption that the response time of the environment is the shortest time scale in the problem .",
    "this approximation , however , is generally incorrect for quantum dot excitons.@xcite it predicts that the environment induces transitions independently of the state of the dot , in contradiction to experiments in which the driving field changes the dephasing .",
    "such dynamical excitation - dependent dephasing has , however , been successfully described by more sophisticated approaches .",
    "these include numerically exact path integral methods@xcite ( quasi - adiabatic propagator path integral , quapi ) ; systematic expansions in exciton - phonon correlations  @xcite up to fourth order and including memory effects ; and time - local approximations@xcite allowing for some of the memory effects neglected in the simplest form of born - markov approximation .",
    "these time - local approximations improve on the simplest born - markov approximation by calculating the decay rates arising from system - bath coupling making use of the actual system hamiltonian , including driving .",
    "this same point , of using the actual system hamiltonian rather than a non - interacting approximation , is also crucial in describing the correct equilibrium state of strongly coupled systems , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "when there is strong coupling to phonons but weak driving of the dot , accurate results can be found by making a polaron transformation@xcite , so that coupling to phonons appears in the driving term ; one may then treat the driving term in the born approximation , and derive effective excitation / de - excitation rates depending on the detuning of the drive , and the phonon density of states , accounting for multi - phonon excitations .",
    "such an approach can also be extended to cavity - qed situations@xcite , with the driving replaced by a coupling to a cavity .",
    "it has also been used to study the fluorescence of a driven quantum dot , coupled to a cavity.@xcite however , the treatment of the driving within the born approximation limits the validity of this approach to weak driving .",
    "alternatively , one may view this as the statement that at strong driving , the dot state changes too rapidly for the phonons to follow , and so the polaron picture breaks down .",
    "this has been extensively studied recently @xcite using a variational polaron transformation  @xcite .",
    "the variational approach can reproduce the exact results of the path integral across a range of driving strengths . in the limit of strong driving and experimentally relevant dot - phonon couplings ,",
    "@xcite show that the time - local approaches discussed above  @xcite become increasingly accurate , as strong driving breaks the polaron picture , and relatively weak dot - phonon coupling ( at low temperatures ) allows both a markovian approximation and the neglect of multiphonon effects .    in this paper",
    ", we consider situations where a dot is strongly driven , and with experimentally relevant ( i.e. , relatively weak ) dot - phonon couplings .",
    "we discuss the application of the bloch - redfield - wangsness@xcite ( brw ) theory , widely used to describe nuclear spin relaxation , to coherent control experiments on excitons in quantum dots .",
    "it is similar to the simplest born - markov approximation , but allows the time scale set by the inverse level spacing of the hamiltonian to be smaller than the response time of the environment .",
    "we use this theory to derive a generalized lindblad form for the phonon - induced damping , in which the transition operators connect the time - dependent eigenstates of the dot , with the expected perturbative transition rates [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) ] .",
    "this differs from the simplest lindblad form mentioned above , which is often applied to quantum dots , in which the transition operators do not necessarily connect eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the forms obtained by some other time - local approximations,@xcite it guarantees the positivity of the density operator , and so can be used across a wider variety of pulse shapes and temperatures .",
    "we focus on the application to determining the effects of phonons for adiabatic rapid passage in quantum dots , and show that the results are similar to those recently obtained from the correlation expansion at fourth order.@xcite that method includes all memory effects of the environment and allows for some phonon correlations , and is known to be accurate@xcite for the parameters relevant here ( since it agrees with the exact path - integral results ) .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) provides a simple picture of the effects of dephasing and a lightweight computational approach for modeling dephasing in quantum dots . as a further application of this theory , we use it to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the phonon spectra and distribution functions , by exploiting the driving - field dependence of the effective damping rates .",
    "we propose and analyze two forms of such spectroscopy , one based on a generalization of the arp experiment , and one based on the response to off - resonant continuous - wave excitation .",
    "these markovian approximations are appropriate for strong driving ; at weak driving ( a limit which is avoided in the remainder of this paper ) , differences arise from the exact solution of the independent boson model ( ibm ) . for infinitesimal",
    "driving , the independent boson model can be analytically solved  @xcite by finding the linear absorption spectrum about the undriven state : @xmath0 , \\varphi(t ) = \\int d \\omega e^{i \\omega t } n_b(\\omega ) j(\\omega)/\\omega^2 $ ] . for the realistic phonon spectral function @xmath1 considered in this paper",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : modelspecdens ] ) ] , the exact absorption spectrum consists of an unbroadened zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) , and sidebands associated with one or many phonon events . at @xmath2k ( the temperature considered for pulse optimization below ) ,",
    "the zpl contains 86% of the spectral weight .",
    "if the markovian approach we use is applied in the limit of weak driving ( outside the range of validity as discussed above ) , it predicts only the zpl , and misses the small phonon sidebands .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy ( at @xmath2k ) is , however , not a consequence of multiphonon effects [ one may safely expand the expression for @xmath3 to linear order in @xmath1 ] , but of the markov approximation .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is as discussed in refs .  :",
    "markovian approaches sample the bath at a frequency dependent on the system hamiltonian , while absorption spectra depend on the bath response at the probe frequency . in the limit of vanishing driving , the markovian approximation , as discussed below ,",
    "produces no linewidth , hence it matches only the dominant zpl part of the exact solution . for any non - zero driving ( i.e. beyond linear response )",
    ", the markovian approach produces a non - zero linewidth , however there is no analytic solution of the ibm for finite driving .",
    "thus , to test our theory in this regime requires comparison to numerical approaches ; such a comparison to existing  @xcite numerical results is , indeed , given below , and the match is seen to be very good ( better than the match for vanishing driving ) .",
    "that is as to be expected , given the central point of recent work  @xcite on `` excitation induced dephasing '' : the presence of strong driving strongly affects the effective dephasing and dissipation rates , and the behavior at vanishing driving does not control how the system responds at strong driving .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in sec.[sec : eom ] , we outline the derivation of the equation of motion for a driven quantum dot interacting with acoustic phonons . in sec.[sec : arpinv ] , we present the predictions of this equation for the inversion ( exciton occupation ) obtained in arp , discuss how this process may be optimized in the presence of phonon - induced dephasing , and explain why the dephasing can in some circumstances improve the final inversion . in sec .",

    "our approach initially follows the same steps as in refs .  .",

    "in this section , we outline the main steps of the derivation , and present further details in the appendix .",
    "we consider a single quantum dot , driven close to one of its discrete transition frequencies by a laser pulse with a time - dependent amplitude and frequency . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the excitation is circularly polarized , so that only one of the exciton spin states is relevant and we may neglect the formation of biexcitons .",
    "thus we model the dot as a two - level system , which may be in the ground state , @xmath6 , or the one - exciton state , @xmath7 .",
