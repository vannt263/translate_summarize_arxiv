    "@xcite , the ideal photon number amplifier ( pna ) of yuen indeed could greatly improve the transmitted ber of the pia .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the problem of characterizing the quality of a low - noise amplifier from the beginning .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "a communication channel between a transmitter and a receiver can be viewed as composed of three basic constituents : an encoder , a transmission line , and a decoder .",
    "the encoder transforms the input of the channel i.e .",
    "the message to be transmitted into a proper set of physical signals that are impinged into the transmission line . in this schematic representation",
    "the transmission line includes all possible physical processes that affect the signal that carries the message from the sender to the receiver , including all noise sources and any kind of device ( e.g. amplifiers ) inserted along the line .",
    "the decoder applies a set of operations on the received signal , like measurements and data processing of the results , and then gives the reconstructed message at the output of the channel .",
    "if no transformation modifies the signals along the line , then the encoded message can be perfectly reconstructed , otherwise errors can arise at the decoder , and the intrinsic potential of the channel decreases .    the significant quantity that measures the efficiency of a communication channel is the mutual information .",
    "let us define it first in the case of a classical discrete channel , and then generalize it later to the continuous and quantum cases .    by definition ,",
    "a discrete channel transmits only symbols belonging to a numerable set .",
    "suppose that the input of the channel is a symbol from the set ( or alphabet ) @xmath0 of @xmath1 elements with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , whereas the output is a symbol from the set @xmath4 of @xmath5 elements ( the two sets need not be equal ) .",
    "the two sets are linked by specifying the conditional probabilities @xmath6 that the output is @xmath7 given the symbol @xmath8 at the input .",
    "the mutual information is given by @xmath9 and quantifies the degree of knowledge ( in bits ) that the output random variable @xmath10 gives about the input random variable @xmath11 ( by the capital letter @xmath12 we denote the random variable , namely the set of symbols @xmath13 along with the corresponding probability distribution @xmath14 ) . the mutual information can also be written as follows @xmath15 namely as the difference between the entropy at the input @xmath16 and the conditional entropy at the output @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unconditioned probability of the output symbol @xmath7 and @xmath19 is the conditioned probability that symbol @xmath8 was transmitted given that symbol @xmath7 is received . in the limiting case @xmath20 that input and output alphabets coincide and the channel is noiseless ( @xmath21 ) , one has @xmath22 namely the information transmitted through a noiseless channel is just the entropy of the input alphabet .",
    "in the opposite limiting case that the input and output random variables are completely uncorrelated ( @xmath23 for all @xmath24 ) the mutual information vanishes .    the definition of mutual information ( [ mutinf ] ) can be straightforwardly generalized to the case of a continuous set of symbols @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with _ a priori _ probability density @xmath27 and conditional probability density @xmath28 . here",
    "the sums in ( [ mutinf ] ) replaced by integrals as follows @xmath29    let us now consider the case of a binary channel , where two different symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' ( which make one `` bit '' ) are transmitted with equal _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath30 .",
    "usually a binary channel is characterized by the probability of making errors at the decoder , called `` bit error rate '' ( ber ) , and defined as follows @xmath31 in eq .",

    "all quantities of interest ( e.g. ber @xmath35 and mutual information @xmath36 ) can be expressed .",
    "the mutual information of the binary channel takes the form @xmath37\\;.",
    "\\label{ib}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the binary channel the ber gives the same characterization as the mutual information in the limiting case of small error probabilities ( @xmath38 ) . here",
    ", @xmath36 can be expanded at first order in @xmath32 and @xmath39 , and one has @xmath40 notice , however , that the ber and the mutual information generally do not give the same description of the channel , as one can have channels with the same ber but having different mutual information , and vice versa .",
    "for instance , consider the case @xmath41 corresponding to @xmath42 ( namely no errors are made in the identification of the binary symbol at the output ) .",
    "as mentioned before this means that the information is maximum , i.e. @xmath43 . on the other hand , for @xmath44 one has @xmath45 , namely the output symbol is always interpreted in the wrong way : in this case , however , the mutual information is still unit , and , in fact , it is possible to reconstruct the transmitted message without ambiguity by swapping the symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' at the output .",
    "moreover , one can have different values of the mutual information that correspond to the same ber , just by varying the probabilities of error and keeping their sum fixed .    as shown in the above examples ,",
    "the mutual information gives a more complete description of the communication channel than the ber , and hence it should be adopted as the right quantity to characterize the channel . in the rest of this paper",
    ", however , we will use the ber , because in our case the probabilities of error are so small that ber is equivalent to the mutual information via eq .",
    "( [ equi ] ) .",
    "in this section we specialize the above concepts to the quantum communication channel , where the information is encoded on quantum states . in the first two subsections we give a characterization of the channel in terms of mutual information , and in terms of gain and noise figure of the devices inserted along the line . finally , in subsec .",
    "[ sec : sectfpe ] we review the description of the dynamical evolution of the quantum state along the transmission line , with the insertion of both amplification and losses .      in a quantum channel",
    "the symbols to be transmitted are encoded into density operators @xmath46 on the hilbert space @xmath47 of the dynamical system that supports the communication .",
    "the alphabet ( which can be either discrete or continuous ) is distributed according to an _ a priori _ probability density @xmath27 , which also determines the mixture @xmath48 given by @xmath49 the set of states @xmath46 and the probability density @xmath27 are globally referred to as `` encoding '' .",
    "the transmission line includes all dynamical transformations of the encoded states between the encoder and the decoder . in the schrdinger picture",
    "these are described by a completely positive ( cp ) map @xmath50 acting on the density matrix @xmath51 that carries the information through the channel .",
    "the last step in the communication channel is the decoding operation , where the recognition of the transmitted symbol is established as the result of a quantum measurement . in the general case",

    "normalization of the probability @xmath59 is guaranteed by the completeness relation @xmath60 each measurement apparatus is described by a pom .",
    "actually , the pom comes from a customary orthogonal projection - valued measure that includes also the degrees of freedom of the apparatus , which are partially traced out in order to give a description of the system alone .",
    "notice that the correspondence between measuring apparatus and pom s is not one - to - one , since different detectors can be described by the same pom . in a quantum communication channel",
    "the pom specifies the conditional probabilities in the mutual information ( [ minf - cont ] ) , namely @xmath61\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of the mutual information depends on all the three steps of the communication channel : encoding , transmission and decoding .",
    "the maximum of @xmath62 over all possible _ a priori _ probability densities @xmath27 for a given constraint ( typically the average power along the line ) and for an ideal channel ( namely @xmath63 is the identical transformation ) is called `` capacity '' @xmath64 of the channel , whereas the global maximum obtained optimizing also over both encoding and decoding is called `` ultimate quantum capacity '' . for fixed average power @xmath65 , using the holevo - ozawa - yuen information bound@xcite it can be proved that the ultimate quantum capacity for a quantum  optical channel is achieved by direct detection and number - state encoding , with @xmath48 being the thermal state with photon number @xmath66 .",
    "let us now consider the effects of the insertion of an amplifier in a transmission line .",
    "the performances of a quantum amplifier are described in terms of the gain and the disturbance caused by the device to the transmitted signal .",
    "as already discussed , the best quantity to characterize the disturbance is the loss of mutual information with respect to the case of ideal transmission .",
    "however , although the noise figure is significant only for gaussian channels ( see sec .",
    "[ gauss ] ) , this is the quantity that is customarily used to characterize the disturbance of the amplifier .",
    "both gain and noise figure generally depend on the overall configuration of the channel , i.e. on the particular encoded states and on the kind of detection at the decoder .",
    "the gain is defined as the ratio between the output and the input signals as follows @xmath67 where the signals @xmath68 are defined as the difference between expectation values @xmath69",
    "where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the cp map of the amplifier from the input to the output , @xmath73 is the detected operator and @xmath74 is a reference state . for optical amplifiers at the input of the channel",
    "the state @xmath75 is usually the vacuum , but it is generally transformed into a non - vacuum state @xmath76 as it evolves through the amplifier .",
    "an amplifier is called `` linear '' when the gain does not depend on the input state @xmath77 .",
    "notice that , as the signal depends on the detection scheme defined by the observable @xmath78 , in principle the linear character of a device depends on the kind of detection at the output .",
    "the noise figure quantifies the degradation of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) from the input to the output , and is defined as @xmath79 in eq .",

    "however , a quantitative characterization should be based on the change of mutual information due to the amplifier insertion . for this reason ,",
    "we define as `` ideal '' an amplifier that does not degrade an optimized channel , namely that leaves the information invariant in a channel where the information has been already maximized over all possible encodings and decodings for a given constraint . as a rescaling of the probability distribution @xmath87 leaves the mutual information in eq .",
    "( [ minf - cont ] ) invariant , an amplifier that rescales the probability by the gain @xmath88 hence maps the observable @xmath78 to @xmath89 is ideal ( the pathological situation of bounded spectrum is not considered , as in this case the concept itself of amplification is meaningless ) .",
    "for such an ideal amplifier one has unit noise figure @xmath90 , independently of the input state .",
    "it is clear that for a non optimized channel , an amplifier can _ increase _ the mutual information , and , actually , this is its purpose .",
    "in fact , by rescaling the detection spectrum the amplifier expands the effective dimension of the hilbert space that supports the relevant part of the transmitted information .",
    "the loss of information in a non optimized channel can be caused either by an irreversible dynamics along the line ( this is the case of the loss ) , and/or by a mismatch between coding and detection , or by low quantum efficiency of the detector . in the first case it is clear that the amplifier must be inserted before the leak of information , namely as a _",
    "preamplifier _ , whereas in the second case it can be inserted just before the detector , the quantum efficiency representing essentially an irreversible evolution inside the detector .",
    "notice that the configuration of the channel with the amplifier before the loss may violate the physical constraint of limited power , and hence the best configuration is a distributed gain along the line .",
    "in the case of a binary channel , with symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' corresponding to the input states @xmath91 and @xmath58 ( @xmath74 being the vacuum ) , the gain is given by eq .",

    "as a matter of fact , the numerical analysis shows that the ber for the laser is always worse than ( or , at best , very close to ) that of the pia , even if the noise figure for the laser is very small .",

    "[ f : pia.vs.sat ] , where the output probability distribution of the two amplifiers is plotted in a regime of strong saturation for the laser .",
    "the saturated laser tends to cut off the right tail of the output distributions for high photon numbers . on the other hand , the ideal pia",
    ", being a linear device , evolves both tails of the distribution in the same way .",
    "if we analyze the two amplifiers at the same gain , the left tail of the bit `` 1 '' distribution will be higher for the saturable laser than for the ideal pia , since saturation needs a higher contribution from the left tail in order to achieve the same gain , and the left tail is less influenced by saturation than the right one .",
    "for the same reason the bit `` 0 '' distribution at the output of the laser turns out to be much more broadened than for the pia . as a consequence the overlap region of the two ( `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' ) distributions  i.e. the bit error rate  is higher in the saturable laser than in the pia .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , for direct detection , saturation effects in a traveling wave laser amplifier can not yield ber better than those for a pia , although they greatly reduce the noise figure greatly below the sql of 3 db .",
    "in fact , the saturation mechanism broadens the output probability distributions asymmetrically , in such a way that the noise figure is improved , whereas the overlap between the distributions , which gives the ber , is increased .",
    "this mechanism has been shown on the basis of a careful monte carlo simulation of a traveling wave laser amplifier .",
    "the question now is : is it possible to improve the ber of the pia in some way ?",
    "the answer is clearly affirmative , if one just considers that at least the ideal pna could in principle achieve zero ber when amplifying input number states , or has @xmath269 independent of the gain @xmath88 for input bit `` 1 '' in the coherent state @xmath264 , a value anyway much smaller than the corresponding ber for the pia . now",
    "the problem is how to achieve or to approach a pna by a real device , and from the present analysis we conclude that the saturated laser does not approximate a pna better than a pia , even though it has a very low noise figure .",
