    "optical emission lines are a new tool for the exploration of high- and intermediate - velocity clouds ( hvcs and ivcs ) , traditionally discovered and studied in the 21 cm line of  or through absorption line observations .",
    "the h@xmath2  intensity from such structures is typically a few tenths of a rayleigh ( 1 r@xmath15 photons @xmath13 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 @xmath16 ergs @xmath13 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 ) and has only recently been accessible through modern detectors . with such faint emission ,",
    "previous studies of emission lines such as h@xmath2 , [ ] , and [ ] from hvcs and ivcs have been limited to single pointed observations , although they have gleaned some of the first information about the ionization , temperature , and metallicity of these gas structures ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since most of the known hvcs and ivcs are at high latitudes and many are distant ( @xmath17 pc ) structures , studies of their ionized component reveal information not only about the clouds themselves but also about the environment of the galactic halo and the escape of radiation from the galactic plane .    with high sensitivity and velocity resolution",
    ", the recently completed wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) northern sky survey is yielding an enormous amount of new information about the ionized nature of ivcs .",
    "@xcite has recently separated out the large ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 )  intermediate - velocity complex  k ( previously classified with complex  c ) centered near @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath7 to @xmath8 km  s@xmath1 . here we present the first map of the ionized component of complex  k.",
    "the wham northern sky survey provides the first velocity - resolved survey of h@xmath2  emission from the galaxy .",
    "each of the 37,300 pointings in the northern survey captures a spectrum over @xmath22 to @xmath23 km  s@xmath1  from a one - degree patch of sky .",
    "since wham provides 12 km  s@xmath1  spectral resolution , we are able to cleanly remove the bright and variable geocoronal h@xmath2  emission ( @xmath24 r ) and numerous fainter ( @xmath25 r ) atmospheric lines ( n. r. hausen et al . , in preparation ) , allowing detections of faint galactic emission below 0.1 r. the survey achieves nearly full coverage of the sky with beam spacings of @xmath26 and @xmath27 above @xmath28 .",
    "more information about the instrument and survey strategy can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and l. m. haffner et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows an image of the h@xmath2  emission from wham and contours of 21 cm emission from the leiden - dwingeloo survey @xcite toward complex k. note that the image and contours reflect a strict integration limit between @xmath29 and @xmath30 km  s@xmath1 . as a result",
    ", the colorbar legend underestimates the total h@xmath2  line intensity by about 20% ( _ e.g. _ figure  [ fig : spectrum1 ] , see below ) .",
    "since the distance to complex k is still relatively uncertain , we have not applied an extinction correction to the data presented here . however , since the total @xmath31 over the face of the cloud only varies from about 1 to @xmath32 @xmath13 , such a correction to the observed h@xmath2  flux would be at most about 25% if all the neutral material is between us and complex k.    the ionized emission is distributed diffusely over the neutral extent of the complex ; it does not appear to arise from numerous point sources within the complex .",
    "the integrated h@xmath2  intensity in the region displayed in figure  [ fig : image ] ranges from 0.5 r down to a conservative detection limit of 0.1 r or em @xmath33 1.1 to 0.2 @xmath9 pc ( 1 r @xmath34 @xmath9 pc for @xmath35 k ) .",
    "the extent of the h@xmath2  emission in the main part of the complex ( @xmath36 to @xmath37 , @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) matches the @xmath40 @xmath13 contour quite closely ; however , the peaks in each emission component do not correspond as well .",
    "a detailed quantitative analysis of the h@xmath2  and  intensities within each one - degree wham pointing reveals that there is little correlation between the integrated intensities of the ivc components . the linear correlation coefficient for pointings within the main part of the complex is 0.4 .",
    "although the spatial distribution and velocity profiles correspond extremely well , a simple relationship relating the h@xmath2  intensity to the  column does not exist .",
    "in fact , for many of the largest concentrations of  emission ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath41 ; @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) , the brighter h@xmath2  emission is consistently at higher longitudes than the regions of brightest 21 cm emission .",
    "we created h@xmath2  and  latitude profiles from the images to quantify the extent of this offset . by examining the two latitude profiles simultaneously and by computing correlation coefficients between the profiles in their natural and offset positions , we find that the h@xmath2  emission is consistently shifted or extended to higher galactic longitudes in nearly all latitude slices by a 2 to 4 degrees .    figures  [ fig : spectrum1 ] and [ fig : spectrum2 ] present representative h@xmath2  spectra ( top panels ) from complex k with the one - degree wham beam centered at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "corresponding  21 cm spectra centered at @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the leiden - dwingeloo  survey are displayed in the bottom panel of each figure .",
    "these two sightlines sample some of the brighter emission from complex k. the dashed vertical lines denote the integration range used to construct the h@xmath2  image and 21 cm contours in figure  [ fig : image ] . since hydrogen has a thermal width of @xmath48 km  s@xmath1  at @xmath49 k , we have chosen a restricted integration range to avoid contamination in the image from the local emission component centered near @xmath50 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "as noted above , the values in the color legend of figure  [ fig : image ] should be increased by about 20% to estimate the total intensity of a typical complex k emission line .",
    "the solid lines in the top panels of figures  [ fig : spectrum1 ] and [ fig : spectrum2 ] represent a gaussian component fit convolved with the wham instrument profile ( approximately 12 km  s@xmath1  fwhm ) .",
    "we also performed a multi - component fit on the  spectrum .",
    "only the ivc component is shown clearly in the bottom panels of figures  [ fig : spectrum1 ] and [ fig : spectrum2 ] since little effort was spent trying to accurately model the bright , local 21 cm emission .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum2 ] clearly shows at least two components in the intermediate - velocity neutral gas",
    ". a single gaussian fit to the h@xmath2  emission in this direction results in a large ( @xmath51 km  s@xmath1 ) width , atypical of diffuse gas ; a free - fit two gaussian profile is not well defined due to the intrinsic ionized gas line widths .",
    "instead , we have chosen to fix the mean velocity of the two components in the h@xmath2  fit to be the same as those clearly defined in the  profile .",
    "the best parameters for our fits are given in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "channel maps and profile analyses show some variation in the mean velocity of the h@xmath2  and  emission , with values that fall roughly between @xmath30 and @xmath52 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "there appears to be no systematic velocity gradients in the complex , although the higher velocity  component at @xmath52 km  s@xmath1  is limited to the two regions of the complex centered at @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , little absorption line data directly toward complex k exists at this time , and thus we have little information about its distance , only that it lies between about 0.3 and 7.7 kpc .",
    "there is a firm upper limit since the cloud has been seen in absorption @xcite toward m  13 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "@xcite have recently calculated the distance modulus of m  13 to be 14.44 mag , which sets an upper limit of 7.7 kpc on the distance to that portion of complex k toward m  13 . a lower limit to",
    "the distance comes from the work of @xcite who included three local stars in their absorption line study of stars in m  13 .",
    "two of their targets , hd 151749 and hd 150462 , have reliably measured parallaxes ( _ hipparcos _ , * ? ? ? * ) , which place them at 150 and 175 pc , respectively .",
    "their third target , hd 149802 , has an estimated distance of about 270 pc given that it and hd 150462 have both been classified as a0 but differ in v brightnesses by 0.9 mag .",
    "they did not detect complex k absorption in either ca ii or na i toward any of these stars .",
    "if the entire complex is at a common distance then its angular extent , from @xmath38 to @xmath56 , corresponds to a length of @xmath57 kpc and a maximum vertical extent above the midplane of @xmath58 kpc , where @xmath59 is the distance to the complex in units of 1 kpc .",
    "if instead the complex is a column of gas perpendicular to the galactic plane at a constant _ radial _ distance ( distance along the galactic plane ) from the sun , its length is @xmath60 kpc , where @xmath61 is the radial distance of the complex from the sun in units of 1 kpc .",
    "gas participating in galactic rotation toward the center of the complex near @xmath62 , @xmath63 would be expected to have a radial velocity of @xmath64 km  s@xmath1at 1 kpc up to a maximum ( at the tangent point ) of @xmath65 km  s@xmath1  at 6.5 kpc @xcite . as a result , the deviation velocity @xcite for complex",
    "k is approximately @xmath66 km  s@xmath1  from that expected by circular rotation .    with few observations of the ionized component of ivcs and hvcs ,",
    "it is difficult to discriminate among possible candidates for the source of ionization . since the clouds are moving at anomalous velocities , processes such as ram - pressure heating @xcite and radiation produced by a cloud - halo shocked interface",
    "have been explored @xcite in addition to photoionization by an ambient lyman continuum flux @xcite . in the case of",
    "complex k , the relatively diffuse h@xmath2  emission over the extent of the neutral gas suggests the latter ionization mechanism .",
    "however , at its lower distance limit ( 300 pc ) , the vertical extent of the complex is only @xmath67 to @xmath68 pc , fully within the wim layer , and its anomalous velocity would likely cause an interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "but unless complex k is falling nearly directly towards us , we find little evidence for an h@xmath2  enhancement in the morphology due to cloud motion",
    ". in support of photoionization by an external or ambient flux , note that while the total  column densities presented in table  [ tab : fit ] for the ivc components vary by a factor eight , the h@xmath2  intensities are relatively constant .",
    "for the cloud as a whole , we find that the neutral gas displays much higher intensity contrast than the ionized gas in complex k ( see also figures [ fig : spectrum1 ] and [ fig : spectrum2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as noted above in  [ sec : results ] , the point - to - point correspondence of the total ivc intensity of the two emission lines is poor .",
    "these observations are consistent with photoionizing the skin of a neutral cloud . in this case",
    ", the cloud becomes self - shielding from ionizing radiation and @xmath69 is independent from the h@xmath2  intensity , which becomes mostly a function of incident lyman continuum flux and geometry .",
    "if a cloud is ionized by an external photoionizing source , the incident lyman continuum flux on the cloud surface can be estimated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ignoring the complexity of geometry but applying the maximum possible extinction correction ( 25% ; see  [ sec : results ] ) to the sample ionized ivc component in table  [ tab : fit ] , we find the incident flux of ionizing photons is @xmath70 photons @xmath71 s@xmath1for the brightest h@xmath2  regions in complex k. with the small lower limit on its distance , there is some chance that complex k is a relatively local feature that could be ionized by nearby sources .",
    "a search within @xmath72 of @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( the rough center of the brightest regions of the complex ) reveals no early spectral type objects with sufficient luminosity to ionize the region , even at its minimum distance of @xmath73 pc . as noted above , the ionized regions with higher h@xmath2  intensities appear to be offset a few degrees from the larger column density neutral regions . to test whether the ionization of the complex could be sustained by a brighter , more distant halo source",
    ", we have explored a large region at higher galactic longitudes than complex k ( @xmath74 ; @xmath75 ) for possible ionizing sources . in this case",
    ", the only potential source appears to be the o9.5 v star hd 93521 ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the direction and range of distances possible for complex k , it is closest to the star when placed about 700 pc away ( @xmath79 pc ) ; here they are separated by about 1.5 kpc . using a value of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons per second emitted from an o9.5 v star @xcite and taking into account _ only _ the geometrical dilution of the radiation ( i.e. no intervening gas or dust absorption ) , we find that the ionizing flux at complex k from hd 93521 is @xmath82 photons @xmath71 s@xmath1 , far short of that needed to maintain the ionization of the complex",
    ".    more likely , a scenario similar to those used to explain the ionization of the warm ionized medium @xcite is also providing the ionizing flux for complex k. @xcite cite upward halo ionizing fluxes for their various models of the propagation of ob association radiation through the surrounding superbubbles .",
    "their range of calculated values , @xmath83@xmath84 photons @xmath71 s@xmath1 , agree well with what is required to maintain the ionization of complex k. @xcite have produced a model of the propagation of the ionizing flux in the galactic halo and the resulting h@xmath2  emission from halo clouds .",
    "we find that our observed h@xmath2  intensity is consistent with that expected from their model in the direction of complex k for distances @xmath85 kpc from the sun ( 0.150.30 r ; j. bland - hawthorn 2000 , private communication ) . cooling hot gas generated in supernova remnants has also been shown by @xcite to provide a mean value of @xmath86 photons @xmath71 s@xmath1  to the halo ionizing flux , nearly half that required for the brightest emitting regions in the complex and sufficient alone to sustain the faintest .    with wham ,",
    "we have finally begun to explore the structure of the ionized component of ivcs and hvcs with the h@xmath2  line in the same manner as has been done for the neutral gas with the 21 cm line .",
    "furthermore , maps in other optical emission lines such as [ ] and [ ] will provide additional information about the temperature , ionization , and metallicity of the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "these future observations have the potential to provide insight not only about the nature of these high latitude structures but also about the ambient galactic halo gas and radiation field .                                , m. a.  c. , lindegren , l. , kovalevsky , j. , hoeg , e. , bastian , u. , bernacca , p.  l. , crz , m. , donati , f. , grenon , m. , van leeuwen , f. , van der marel , h. , mignard , f. , murray , c.  a. , le poole , r.  s. , schrijver , h. , turon , c. , arenou , f. , froeschl , m. , & petersen , c.  s. 1997 , , 323 , l49",
