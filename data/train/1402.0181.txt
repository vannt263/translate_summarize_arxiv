    "extensions of the standard model imply new symmetries and new particle states . in particle theory noether s theorem",
    "relates the exact symmetry to conservation of respective charge .",
    "if the symmetry is strict , the charge is strictly conserved .",
    "the lightest particle , bearing this charge , is stable .",
    "it gives rise to the deep relationship between dark matter candidates and particle symmetry beyond the standard model .",
    "according to the modern cosmology , the dark matter , corresponding to @xmath0 of the total cosmological density , is nonbaryonic and consists of new stable forms of matter .",
    "these forms of matter ( see e.g. refs . for review and reference ) should be stable , saturate the measured dark matter density and decouple from plasma and radiation at least before the beginning of matter dominated stage .",
    "the easiest way to satisfy these conditions is to involve neutral elementary weakly interacting particles .",
    "however it is not the only particle physics solution for the dark matter problem and more evolved models of the physical nature of dark matter are possible .",
    "formation of the large scale structure of the universe from small initial density fluctuations is one of the most important reasons for the _ nonbaryonic _ nature of the dark matter that is decoupled from matter and radiation and provides the effective growth of these fluctuations before recombination .",
    "it implies dark matter candidates from the physics beyond the standard model ( see refs . for recent review ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial density fluctuations , coming from the very early universe are also originated from physics beyond the standard model . in the present review",
    "we give some examples , linking the primordial seeds of galaxy formation to effects of particle symmetry breaking at very high energies .",
    "here we do nt touch the exciting problems of the possible nature of dark matter related with extra dimensions and brane cosmology , but even in the case of our 1 + 3 dimensional space - time we find a lot of examples of nontrivial candidates for cosmological dark matter .    in the section [ pattern ] we present examples of various types of particle candidates for dark matter .",
    "we then pay special attention to a possibility for stable charged species of new quarks and leptons to form dark matter , hidden in neutral dark atoms ( section [ asymmetry ] ) . in section [ ohe ]",
    "we consider specific form of o - helium ( ohe ) dark atoms that consist of heavy -2 charged heavy lepton - like particle surrounded by helium nuclear shell .",
    "the qualitative advantages of this ohe scenario and the problems of its proof on the basis of a strict quantum mechanical solution of the problem of ohe interaction with nuclei are discussed in section [ solution ] .",
    "the conclusive section [ discussion ] considers the challenges for experimental test of the ohe solution for the puzzles of dark matter searches .",
    "most of the known particles are unstable . for a particle with the mass @xmath1",
    "the particle physics time scale is @xmath2 , ] so in particle world we refer to particles with lifetime @xmath3 as to metastable",
    ". to be of cosmological significance in the big bang universe metastable particle should survive after the temperature of the universe @xmath4 fell down below @xmath5 , what means that the particle lifetime should exceed @xmath6 .",
    "such a long lifetime should find reason in the existence of an ( approximate ) symmetry . from this viewpoint , cosmology is sensitive to the most fundamental properties of microworld , to the conservation laws reflecting strict or nearly strict symmetries of particle theory .",
    "so , electron is absolutely stable , what reflects the conservation of electric charge . in the same manner",
    "the stability of proton is conditioned by the conservation of baryon charge .",
    "the stability of ordinary matter is thus protected by the conservation of electric and baryon charges , and its properties reflect the fundamental physical scales of electroweak and strong interactions .",
    "indeed , the mass of electron is related to the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking , whereas the mass of proton reflects the scale of qcd confinement .    the new strict symmetry is then reflected in the existence of new stable particles , which should be present in the universe and considered as candidates for dark matter .",
    "the simplest form of dark matter candidates is the gas of new stable neutral massive particles , originated from early universe . for particles with the mass @xmath1 , at high temperature @xmath7 the equilibrium condition , @xmath8 is valid , if their annihilation cross section @xmath9 is sufficiently large to establish the equilibrium . at @xmath10",
    "such particles go out of equilibrium and their relative concentration freezes out .",
    "this is the main idea of calculation of primordial abundance for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps , see e.g. refs . for details ) .",
    "the process of wimp annihilation to ordinary particles , considered in @xmath11channel , determines their scattering cross section on ordinary particles and thus relates the primordial abundance of wimps to their scattering rate in the ordinary matter .",
    "forming nonluminous massive halo of our galaxy , wimps can penetrate the terrestrial matter and scatter on nuclei in underground detectors .",
    "the strategy of direct wimp searches implies detection of recoil nuclei from this scattering .",
    "the process inverse to annihilation of wimps corresponds to their production in collisions of ordinary particles .",
    "it should lead to effects of missing mass and energy - momentum , being the challenge for experimental search for production of dark matter candidates at accelerators , e.g. at lhc .",
    "more weakly interacting and/or more light species decouple from plasma and radiation being relativistic at @xmath12 , when @xmath13 i.e. at @xmath14 after decoupling these species retain their equilibrium distribution until they become non - relativistic at @xmath15 .",
    "conservation of partial entropy in the cosmological expansion links the modern abundance of these species to number density of relic photons with the account for the increase of the photon number density due to the contribution of heavier ordinary particles , which were in equilibrium in the period of decoupling .    for the long time , it seemed possible that relic neutrinos can be the dominant form of cosmological dark matter and the corresponding neutrino - dominated universe was considered as physical ground of hot dark matter scenario of large scale structure formation .",
    "experimental discovery of neutrino oscillations together with stringent upper limits on the mass of electron neutrino exclude this possibility .",
    "moreover , even neutrino masses in the range of 1ev lead to features in the spectrum of density fluctuations that are excluded by the observational data of cmb .",
    "the maximal temperature , which is reached in inflationary universe , is the reheating temperature , @xmath16 , after inflation .",
    "so , the very weakly interacting particles with the annihilation cross section @xmath17 as well as very heavy particles with the mass @xmath18 can not be in thermal equilibrium , and the detailed mechanism of their production should be considered to calculate their primordial abundance",
    ".    in particular , thermal production of gravitino in very early universe is proportional to the reheating temperature @xmath16 , what puts upper limit on this temperature from constraints on primordial gravitino abundance@xcite .",
    "a wide class of particle models possesses a symmetry breaking pattern , which can be effectively described by pseudo - nambu  goldstone ( png ) field ( see refs . for review and references ) .",
    "the coherent oscillations of this field represent a specific type of cdm in spite of a very small mass of png particles @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , since these particles are created in bose - einstein condensate in the ground state , i.e. they are initially created as nonrelativistic in the very early universe",
    ". this feature , typical for invisible axion models can be the general feature for all the axion - like png particles .    at high temperatures",
    "the pattern of successive spontaneous and manifest breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry implies the succession of second order phase transitions . in the first transition at @xmath21 , continuous degeneracy of vacua leads , at scales exceeding the correlation length , to the formation of topological defects in the form of a string network ; in the second phase transition at @xmath22 , continuous transitions in space between degenerated vacua form surfaces : domain walls surrounded by strings .",
    "this last structure is unstable , but , as was shown in the example of the invisible axion @xcite , it is reflected in the large scale inhomogeneity of distribution of energy density of coherent png ( axion ) field oscillations .",
    "this energy density is proportional to the initial value of phase , which acquires dynamical meaning of amplitude of axion field , when axion mass @xmath23",
    "( where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pion mass and constant , respectively , the constant @xmath26 depends on the choice of the axion model and @xmath27 is the scale of the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking ) is switched on in the result of the second phase transition .    the value of phase changes by @xmath28 around string .",
    "this strong nonhomogeneity of phase leads to corresponding nonhomogeneity of energy density of coherent png ( axion ) field oscillations .",
    "usual argument ( see e.g. ref . and references therein ) is essential only on scales , corresponding to mean distance between strings .",
    "this distance is small , being of the order of the scale of cosmological horizon in the period , when png field oscillations start .",
    "however , since the nonhomogeneity of phase follows the pattern of axion string network this argument misses large scale correlations in the distribution of oscillations energy density .",
    "indeed , numerical analysis of string network ( see review in the ref . ) indicates that large string loops are strongly suppressed and the fraction of about 80% of string length , corresponding to long loops , remains virtually the same in all large scales .",
    "this property is the other side of the well known scale invariant character of string network .",
    "therefore the correlations of energy density should persist on large scales , as it was revealed in refs . .",
    "discussion of such primordial inhomogeneous structures of dark matter go beyond the scope of the present paper and we can recommend the interested reader refs . for review and references .",
    "extensive hidden sector of particle theory can provide the existence of new interactions , which only new particles possess .",
    "historically one of the first examples of such self - interacting dark matter was presented by the model of mirror matter .",
    "mirror particles , first proposed by t. d. lee and c. n. yang in ref . to restore equivalence of left- and right - handed co - ordinate systems in the presence of p- and c- violation in weak interactions , should be strictly symmetric by their properties to their ordinary twins .",
    "after discovery of cp - violation it was shown by i. yu .",
    "kobzarev , l. b. okun and i. ya .",
    "pomeranchuk in ref .",
    "that mirror partners can not be associated with antiparticles and should represent a new set of symmetric partners for ordinary quarks and leptons with their own strong , electromagnetic and weak mirror interactions .",
    "it means that there should exist mirror quarks , bound in mirror nucleons by mirror qcd forces and mirror atoms , in which mirror nuclei are bound with mirror electrons by mirror electromagnetic interaction @xcite . if gravity is the only common interaction for ordinary and mirror particles , mirror matter can be present in the universe in the form of elusive mirror objects , having symmetric properties with ordinary astronomical objects ( gas , plasma , stars , planets ... ) , but causing only gravitational effects on the ordinary matter @xcite .    even in the absence of any other common interaction except for gravity ,",
    "the observational data on primordial helium abundance and upper limits on the local dark matter seem to exclude mirror matter , evolving in the universe in a fully symmetric way in parallel with the ordinary baryonic matter@xcite . the symmetry in cosmological evolution of mirror matter can be broken either by initial conditions@xcite , or by breaking mirror symmetry in the sets of particles and their interactions as it takes place in the shadow world@xcite , arising in the heterotic string model .",
    "we refer to refs . for current review of mirror matter and its cosmology .    if new particles possess new @xmath29-charge , interacting with massless bosons or intermediate bosons with sufficiently small mass ( @xmath29-interaction ) , for slow @xmath29-charged particles coulomb - like factor of `` gamov - sommerfeld - sakharov enhancement '' @xcite should be added in the annihilation cross section @xmath30 where @xmath31 is relative velocity and @xmath32 is the running gauge constant of @xmath29-interaction",
    ". this factor may not be essential in the period of particle freezing out in the early universe ( when @xmath31 was only few times smaller than @xmath33 , but can cause strong enhancement in the effect of annihilation of nonrelativistic dark matter particles in the galaxy .",
    "if charge symmetric stable particles ( and their antiparticles ) represent only subdominant fraction of the cosmological dark matter , more detailed analysis of their distribution in space , of their condensation in galaxies , of their capture by stars , sun and earth , as well as effects of their interaction with matter and of their annihilation provides more sensitive probes for their existence .",
    "in particular , hypothetical stable neutrinos of 4th generation with mass about 50 gev should be the subdominant form of modern dark matter , contributing less than 0,1 % to the total density @xcite",
    ". however , direct experimental search for cosmic fluxes of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) may be sensitive to existence of such component ( see refs . and references therein ) .",
    "it was shown in refs . that annihilation of 4th neutrinos and their antineutrinos in the galaxy is severely constrained by the measurements of gamma - background , cosmic positrons and antiprotons .",
    "4th neutrino annihilation inside the earth should lead to the flux of underground monochromatic neutrinos of known types , which can be traced in the analysis of the already existing and future data of underground neutrino detectors @xcite .",
    "an interesting multi - component scenario , based on millicharges and presented in ref . , proposes a dark sector composed of traditional collisionless particles and of a subdominant more complex part , where two new kinds of fermions are introduced and form hydrogen - like atoms through a dark @xmath34 gauge coupling carried out by a dark massless photon .",
    "while one of the two species is light and plays the role of a dark electron , the other one is heavy and is seen as the nucleus of the atom . the latter is coupled to a dark neutral scalar via a yukawa coupling , creating a finite - range attraction between dark nuclei .",
    "non - gravitational interactions between the dark and the ordinary sectors come into play through the kinetic and mass mixings between the photon and the dark photon and between the standard @xmath35 meson and the dark scalar respectively .",
    "these have straightforward consequences in direct - dark - matter - search experiments since both dark fermions have small effective couplings to the standard photon while the dark nucleus is coupled to the @xmath35 meson , making it capable of interacting with nucleons .",
    "the dark atoms of the halo , that might form a disk , hit the surface of the earth and collide with terrestrial atoms until they lose all their energy and thermalize .",
    "this happens before they reach an underground detector , typically located at a depth of @xmath36 km , after what they start sinking down , driven by gravity , and arrive in the detector with thermal energies .",
    "this makes it impossible to produce nuclear recoils but the dark nuclei bind to the nuclei of the active medium via radiative capture , which causes the emission of photons that produce the observed signal .",
    "the model , thanks to its complex subdominant part , can reproduce well the results from dama / libra and cogent without contradicting with the negative results from xenon100 , lux and cdms - ii / ge .      decaying particles with lifetime @xmath37 , exceeding the age of the universe , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , can be treated as stable . by definition ,",
    "primordial stable particles survive to the present time and should be present in the modern universe .",
    "the net effect of their existence is given by their contribution into the total cosmological density .",
    "however , even small effect of their decay can lead to significant contribution to cosmic rays and gamma background@xcite .",
    "leptonic decays of dark matter are considered as possible explanation of the cosmic positron excess , measured in the range above 10 gev by pamela@xcite , fermi / lat@xcite and ams02@xcite .    primordial unstable particles with the lifetime , less than the age of the universe , @xmath40 , can not survive to the present time .",
    "but , if their lifetime is sufficiently large to satisfy the condition @xmath41 , their existence in early universe can lead to direct or indirect traces@xcite .",
    "weakly interacting particles , decaying to invisible modes , can influence large scale structure formation .",
    "such decays prevent formation of the structure , if they take place before the structure is formed .",
    "invisible products of decays after the structure is formed should contribute in the cosmological dark energy .",
    "the unstable dark matter scenarios@xcite implied weakly interacting particles that form the structure on the matter dominated stage and then decay to invisible modes after the structure is formed",
    ".    cosmological flux of decay products contributing into the cosmic and gamma ray backgrounds represents the direct trace of unstable particles@xcite .",
    "if the decay products do not survive to the present time their interaction with matter and radiation can cause indirect trace in the light element abundance@xcite or in the fluctuations of thermal radiation@xcite .",
    "the fact that particles are not absolutely stable means that the corresponding charge is not strictly conserved and generation particle charge asymmetry is possible , as it is assumed for ordinary baryonic matter . at sufficiently strong particle annihilation cross section excessive particles ( antiparticles )",
    "can dominate in the relic density , leaving exponentially small admixture of their antiparticles ( particles ) in the same way as primordial excessive baryons dominate over antibaryons in baryon asymmetric universe . in this case",
    "_ asymmetric dark matter _ does nt lead to significant effect of particle annihilation in the modern universe and can be searched for either directly in underground detectors or indirectly by effects of decay or condensation and structural transformations of e.g. neutron stars ( see ref . for recent",
    "review and references ) .",
    "if particle annihilation is nt strong enough , primordial pairs of particles and antiparticles dominate over excessive particles ( or antiparticles ) and this case has no principle difference from the charge symmetric case . in particular , for very heavy charged leptons ( with the mass above 1 tev ) , like `` tera electrons''@xcite , discussed in [ asymmetry ] , their annihilation due to electromagnetic interaction is too weak to provide effective suppression of primordial tera electron - positron pairs relative to primordial asymmetric excess@xcite .",
    "new particles with electric charge and/or strong interaction can form anomalous atoms and contain in the ordinary matter as anomalous isotopes .",
    "for example , if the lightest quark of 4th generation is stable , it can form stable charged hadrons , serving as nuclei of anomalous atoms of e.g. anomalous helium @xcite . therefore",
    ", stringent upper limits on anomalous isotopes , especially , on anomalous hydrogen put severe constraints on the existence of new stable charged particles .",
    "however , as we discuss in the rest of this review , stable doubly charged particles can not only exist , but even dominate in the cosmological dark matter , being effectively hidden in neutral `` dark atoms''@xcite .",
    "new stable particles may possess new u(1 ) gauge charges and bind by coulomb - like forces in composite dark matter species .",
    "such dark atoms can not be luminous , since they radiate invisible light of u(1 ) photons . historically mirror matter",
    "( see subsubsection [ mirror ] and refs . for review and references )",
    "seems to be the first example of such an atomic dark matter .    however , it turned out that the possibility of new stable electrically charged leptons and quarks is not completely excluded and glashow s tera - helium@xcite has offered a new solution for this type of dark atoms of dark matter .",
    "tera - u - quarks with electric charge + 2/3 formed stable ( uuu ) + 2 charged `` clusters '' that formed with two -1 charged tera - electrons e neutral [ ( uuu)ee ] tera - helium `` atoms '' that behaved like weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the main problem for this solution was to suppress the abundance of positively charged species bound with ordinary electrons , which behave as anomalous isotopes of hydrogen or helium .",
    "this problem turned to be unresolvable@xcite , since the model@xcite predicted stable tera - electrons @xmath42 with charge -1 .",
    "as soon as primordial helium is formed in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) it captures all the free @xmath42 in positively charged @xmath43 ion , preventing any further suppression of positively charged species .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid anomalous isotopes overproduction , stable particles with charge -1 ( and corresponding antiparticles ) should be absent , so that stable negatively charged particles should have charge -2 only .",
    "elementary particle frames for heavy stable -2 charged species are provided by : ( a ) stable `` antibaryons '' @xmath44 formed by anti-@xmath45 quark of fourth generation@xcite ( b ) ac - leptons@xcite , predicted in the extension @xcite of standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry@xcite .",

    "if new stable species belong to non - trivial representations of electroweak su(2 ) group , sphaleron transitions at high temperatures can provide the relationship between baryon asymmetry and excess of -2 charge stable species , as it was demonstrated in the case of wtc in refs . .",

    "kev and absence of such effect at energies above 6 kev means that binding energy @xmath209 of na - ohe system in dama experiment should not exceed 6 kev , being in the range 2 - 4 kev .",
