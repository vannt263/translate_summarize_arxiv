    "they are excellent probes to study all collision stages , since they pass through the created medium almost unaffected . to quantify modifications of the dielectron production in heavy - ion collisions , measurements in pp collisions serve as a reference , while the analysis of p - a collisions allows disentangling cold from hot nuclear matter effects . in alice @xcite at the lhc",
    ", dielectron measurements are performed using the central barrel detectors around mid - rapidity .",
    "electrons can be identified via their specific energy loss in the inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , combined with time - of - flight information from the tof detector @xcite . in this proceedings",
    "we present a virtual direct photon measurement in pp collisions and the invariant mass analyses in p  pb and pb  pb collisions .",
    "prospects of a future measurement in pb  pb after the alice upgrade for lhc run 3 are also discussed .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on @xmath1 minimum bias pp collisions at @xmath0 , recorded in 2010 .",
    "fiducial cuts on transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath3 ) are applied to electron candidates .",
    "a clean electron sample is achieved by cuts on the time - of - flight and on the @xmath4 in the tpc .",
    "dielectron spectra are created for unlike - sign and like - sign combinations of these particles .",
    "the unlike - sign distribution contains a superposition of signal and combinatorial background , while the like - sign is used to provide an estimate of such a background .",
    "the acceptance may be different for unlike- and like - sign pairs due to detector effects .",
    "therefore , the signal yield is obtained as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is built via a mixed - event technique as @xmath7 .",

    "a fit to the data is performed to determine the virtual photon fraction @xmath11 by using the function @xmath12 in the range @xmath13 .",
    "this fit is done in four pair-@xmath9 regions and the extracted virtual photon fraction is then multiplied by the inclusive photon cross section , also measured by alice via the photon conversion method ( pcm ) @xcite . in figure",

    "the analysis is carried out in @xmath3 and two different track selections @xmath2 or @xmath16 are performed , to enable comparisons with both the pp and pb  pb data .",
    "the pid scheme was modified to increase the electron efficiency : a tof signal is not required , yet used if available to purify the electron sample .",
    "kaons and protons are instead rejected by an electron inclusion cut on the @xmath4 measured by the silicon drift and silicon pixel detectors of the its .",
    "in addition , electrons from photon conversions are identified and rejected either by their displaced vertex or by the orientation of the pair plane relative to the magnetic field .",
    "more in detail , since a conversion pair does not have an intrinsic opening angle , an apparent opening after reconstruction may only appear perpendicular to the magnetic field vector , while true finite - mass signal pairs have a uniform azimuthal opening angle .",
    "therefore , an exclusion cut on the pair plane normal vector @xmath17 is applied for @xmath18 .",
    "+ the signal extraction is performed as described in section [ sect - pp ] .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio is smaller than in pp data by a factor two to four , and range from @xmath19 in the @xmath20 mass region to @xmath21 at @xmath22 and to @xmath23 in the @xmath24 region .",

    "the pid scheme is as described for the p  pb analysis . a track selection cut @xmath30 ensures exclusion of charged pions and reduces the contribution from soft conversion and @xmath20-dalitz electrons to the combinatorial background .",
