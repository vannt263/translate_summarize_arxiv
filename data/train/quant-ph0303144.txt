    "degradation of quantum superposed state by decoherence is an obstacle to quantum information processing . in order to proactively prevent errors ,",
    "a multipulse control method has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is essential that the application of @xmath0 pulses causes time reversal in order to suppress the decoherence .",
    "the method has attracted considerable attention ; it has been applied to suppress unwanted spontaneous emission@xcite , the magnetic - state decoherence by collisions in a vapor@xcite and the damping of vibrational mode of a chain of trapped ions@xcite . while the multipulse control method requires no ancillary bits and no accurate detection ,",
    "its effectiveness has been shown when sufficiently short and strong pulses are periodically applied in a shorter interval than the characteristic time of the system - reservoir interaction@xcite .",
    "the degree of suppression becomes larger as the pulse interval becomes shorter .",
    "since these conditions are not easy to execute , a new approach to use a continuous control field instead of pulses has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the control pulses do not always have to be ultra short for systems coupled to the reservoir with @xmath1 spectral density@xcite . in order to overcome the strict condition on the pulse application , it is desirable to seek a possibility to use the pulse trains with relatively long pulse interval .    in previous paper@xcite , we have suggested a possibility to relieve the condition on pulse interval by formulating a theory of pulse control on the pure dephasing phenomena that is caused by the interaction with a boson reservoir . since the ordinary spin - boson model where a spin linearly interacts with the boson reservoir can not describe the irreversibility in the long time region except for the ohmic dissipation case",
    ", we have extended the model to include a nonlinear interaction .",
    "we have found that the multipulse control is effective for this model when the pulse interval is shorter than the reservoir correlation time .",
    "we also found that the effective pure dephasing time shows a non - monotonic dependence on the pulse interval , that is , it has a peak when an application of @xmath0 pulse - train is synchronized with the oscillation of the reservoir .",
    "this means that the pure dephasing phenomenon is also effectively suppressed by paying attention to the dynamics of the reservoir .",
    "however , in many cases , the system - reservoir interaction is described with a strong linear interaction and a weak nonlinear interaction . in the time region where we want to discuss the effectiveness of suppression by synchronizing the pulse application and the dynamics of the reservoir , the linear interaction plays an essential role in the decay .    in this paper , assuming that a two - level system linearly interacts with a boson reservoir that has a characteristic frequency , we discuss the effectiveness of the synchronization of a @xmath0 pulse train with the oscillation of the reservoir . for convenience",
    ", we name this strategy as synchronized pulse control(spc ) in the following discussion .",
    "as recognized in @xcite , spc also depends on the type of coupling(bath ) spectral density . in order to make clear the applicability of spc",
    ", we study the effectiveness of spc on non - lorentzian and lorentzian coupling spectral density .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec.[sec:2 ] , we introduce the model of the decoherence and derive the basic formula for multipulse control on the linear spin - boson model .",

    "let us consider the reason why the spc is ineffective for the case of lorentzian coupling spectral density .",
    "here we use a picture which provides us an qualitative understanding of the physical process of the spc .",
    "the picture is obtained by replacing the original boson reservoir by a two - step structured reservoir where a single harmonic oscillator is coupled to a new `` reservoir '' with a coupling function which is different from the original one .",
    "( the `` reservoir '' means the newly introduced reservoir that causes the decay of the single harmonic oscillator . )",
    "the single harmonic oscillator is called as a quasi mode for atom - cavity system@xcite or an interaction mode for electron - phonon system@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we call the new harmonic oscillator as the interaction mode(fig.[fig : fg9 ] )",
    ". the motion of the interaction mode , which is determined by the coupling to the `` reservoir '' , is characterized by the original coupling spectral density . the frequency ( decay constant ) of the motion of the interaction mode corresponds to the center frequency ( width ) of the original coupling spectral density , respectively .",
    "the application of a @xmath0 pulse causes time reversal to the two - level system .",
    "since the two - level system is coupled to the interaction mode , the degree of time reversal depends on the reversibility of the interaction mode . in the spc",
    ", we equalize the pulse interval to the oscillation period of the interaction mode .",
    "if the reversibility of the interaction mode partially remains at the pulse application times , the spc is effective for suppression of decoherence .",
    "when the original spin - boson interaction is characterized by the lorentzian coupling spectral density , it has been shown that the interaction mode is coupled to the `` reservoir '' with a flat ( white ) coupling spectral density@xcite .",
    "the interaction mode shows the markovian nature , which indicates the irreversibility of the motion of the interaction mode(see appendix ) .",
    "the spc is ineffective for the lorentzian spectral density .    for the case of the non - lorentzian coupling spectral density",
    ", we can also use the two - step structured reservoir where the interaction between the interaction mode and the `` reservoir '' is characterized by a non - white coupling spectral density .",
    "this implies that the time evolution of the interaction mode is non - markovian , and partially reversible at the pulse application time .",
    "one should note that the non - lorentzian coupling spectral density may not always guarantee the effectiveness of pulse control when the coupling spectral density has a slow power - law tail at high frequencies as a recent study indicates@xcite .",
    "however , in many systems such as localized - electron phonon systems , the shape of the coupling spectral density has clear maximum and minimum cut - off frequencies .",
    "the detailed characteristics of the spectral density for an effective pulse control deserve further research .",
    "we should remark that in the limit of short pulse interval , the pulse control is effective even for the lorenzian coupling function . in this case , the interaction mode does not oscillate , and the result is consistent with the ordinary dynamical decoupling@xcite .",
    "we have proposed a new strategy to suppress decoherence by multipulse control , which is done by synchronizing a @xmath0 pulse train with the dynamical motion of reservoir .",
    "we have discussed the effectiveness of spc for the non - lorentzian and the lorentzian coupling spectral density . for the former case",
    ", we find a periodic recovery of a quantum superposition at the pulse application times , whereas we can not obtain the recovery for the latter case .",
    "our scheme is somewhat similar to the synchronized quantum - beat echoes(sqbe)@xcite in the sense that pulses are applied synchronously with the dynamical feature of reservoir .",
    "however , the sqbe is obtained by accumulating the response to each pulse whose area is much smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the sufficient time reversal does not occur in the sqbe scheme and that the obtained echo is different from ours where essential physical origin is time reversibility caused by the each @xmath0 pulse application .",
    "the spc provides us an another kind of method to suppress the decoherence by paying attention to the dynamical motion of the reservoir .",
    "we hope that the synchronized pulse control might extend the possibility of the pulse control of decoherence .",
    "especially , the drastic alteration in the feature of the quantum superposition by changing the pulse interval might indicate that the pulse application plays both roles to keep and erase a quantum memory .",
    "this study is supported by the grant in aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan .",
    "the authors are deeply thankful to dr . l. viola and the anonymous reviewer for their thoughtful comments and suggestions .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly review how to introduce the two - step model with using the interaction mode(or the quasi mode ) .",
    "the interaction mode is the single harmonic oscillator , and the two - level system couples only to this oscillator .",
    "the annihilation operator of the interaction mode is defined by the linear combination of those for the original normal modes as @xmath92 where @xmath93 then , eq.([eqn:4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath94 the new `` reservoir '' modes are determined to be orthogonal to the interaction mode , and the many `` reservoir '' modes are orthogonal with each other .",
    "these boson systems other than the interaction mode do not couple to the spin system , and are called the `` reservoir '' modes .",
    "we should note that the `` reservoir '' here implies the environmental degrees of freedom for the interaction mode , and not for the spin system .",
    "the interaction mode and the `` reservoir '' are coupled to each other as @xmath95 where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the oscillator for `` reservoir '' modes .",
    "the transformation from the original normal modes to the interaction and `` reservoir '' modes provides a new picture where a two - level system interacts with a single harmonic oscillator which contacts with a `` reservoir '' .",
    "when we consider a subsystem which consists of the interaction mode and the `` reservoir '' with @xmath98 , the markovian master equation which describes time evolution of the interaction mode is solved to give the exponential decay of the coherent state amplitudes@xcite , whose decay constant is determined by the coupling spectral density @xmath99 .",
    "the center frequency of the coupling spectral density in the original normal modes corresponds to the frequency of the interaction mode , and the width of the coupling spectral density is associated with the decay of the interaction mode arising from the coupling between the interaction mode and the reservoir .",
    "the lorentzian coupling spectral density expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eqn:31 ] ) implies a markovian time evolution of the interaction mode , which indicates the irreversibility of the motion of the interaction mode .",
    "the quasi mode in the quantum optics has been obtained by an analogous procedure@xcite .",
    "we have another example to show that the two - step model with the white `` reservoir '' is equivalent to the normal mode picture with the lorentzian coupling function@xcite .",
    "other than these examples , the two - step model has also been used to describe an effect of coupling between the nuclear reaction coordinate and the other coordinates on electron transfer in biomolecules@xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss the applicability of this strategy by studying the dependence of the decoherence suppression on the shape of the coupling spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effectiveness of this strategy arises from the non - markovian nature of dynamical motion of the reservoir . </S>"
