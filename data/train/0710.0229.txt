    "since the microscopic mechanisms of hadron production in hadron - hadron and heavy ion collisions are not fully understood , thus it is very important to improve our theoretical understanding on this field .",
    "the forthcoming hadron and heavy ion experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc , cern ) at @xmath3 gev will increase the transverse momentum window to @xmath4 gev .",
    "thus lhc experiments will become a decisive test between different perturbative and non - perturbative models of hadron formation , especially in the high-@xmath0 region .",
    "theoretical descriptions of particle production in high energy @xmath5 collisions are based on the introduction of chromoelectric flux tube ( string ) models , where these tubes are connecting the quark and diquark constituents of the colliding protons  @xcite .",
    "string picture is a good example of how to convert the kinetic energy of a collision into field energy .",
    "new hadrons will be produced via quark - antiquark and diquark - antidiquark pair production from the field energy , namely from the unstable flux tubes .",
    "these models can describe experimental data very successfully at small @xmath0 , especially at @xmath6 gev . at higher",
    "@xmath0 one can apply perturbative qcd - based models  @xcite , which can provide the necessary precision to analyse nuclear effects in the nuclear collisions .",
    "however , at rhic and lhc energies the string density is expected to be so large that a strong collective gluon field will be formed in the whole available transverse volume .",
    "furthermore , the gluon number will be so high that a classical gluon field as the expectation value of the quantum field can be considered and investigated in the reaction volume .",
    "the properties of such non - abelian classical fields and details of gluon production were studied very intensively during the last years , especially asymptotic solutions ( for summaries see refs .",
    "fermion production was calculated recently  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations were performed to describe strong classical fields under finite space - time conditions in the very early stage of heavy ion collision , especially immediately after the overlap  @xcite .",
    "new methods have been developed to investigate the influence of inhomogeneity on particle production  @xcite .",
    "fermion pair production together with boson pair production were investigated by different kinetic models of particle production from strong abelian  @xcite and non - abelian  @xcite fields .",
    "these calculations concentrated mostly on the bulk properties of the gluon and quark matter , the time evolution of the system , the time dependence of energy and particle number densities , and the appearance of fast thermalization .",
    "our main interest is the transverse momentum distribution of produced fermions and bosons , however the longitudinal momentum can become equally interesting considering wide rapidity ranges . in our previous paper ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we investigated the abelian case , namely particle pair - production in a strong external electric field .",
    "we have focused on the numerical solution of a kinetic model and discussed the influence of the field strength applying different time dependences .",
    "we have demonstrated a scaling behaviour in time and transverse momenta , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the kinetic equation and the numerical calculation yielded a fermion dominance in the mid - rapidity region . in case of realistic bjorken type time evolution",
    "our numerical result on fermion spectra has overlapped the boson spectra obtained in 1 + 2 dimensional lattice calculations both in magnitude and shape .    in this paper",
    "we solve the kinetic model in the presence of an su(2 ) non - abelian color field .",
    "we focus on the determination of the appropriate kinetic equation system and its numerical solution in case of different initial conditions .",
    "section 2 summarizes the kinetic equation for color wigner function . in section 3",
    "we introduce phenomenologically the fermion distribution function . in section 4",
    "the kinetic equation and its simplifications are displayed in detail , especially with zero fermion mass . in section 5",
    "we present kinetic equation for the case , when external non - abelian field have fixed direction in color space .",
    "the appropriate form of the kinetic equation is determined , which was solved numerically at different time - dependent strong fields .",
    "results on field components and fermion distribution functions are displayed in section 6 .",
    "we display recognized scaling properties of the solutions in section 7 . in appendix",
    "a we show a special non - abelian setup , which leads to the similar results obtained in the abelian case .",
    "the fermion production in a strong external field can be characterized by a space homogeneous wigner function , @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of this wigner function is investigated by the kinetic equation in the frame of the covariant single - time formalism , where a time - dependent abelian ( @xmath10 )  @xcite or non - abelian ( @xmath11 )  @xcite external field is included . here",

    "the color decomposition with @xmath17 generators in fundamental representation ( @xmath18 ) is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the color singlet and @xmath21 is the color multiplet component ( triplet in @xmath22 with @xmath23 ) .",
    "the spinor decomposition is the following : @xmath24    the time evolution of the wigner function is described by eq .",
    "( [ wigner_gen ] ) . using the color and spinor decomposition terms in eqs.([color_decomposition])-([clifford_decomposition ] ) , we will determine the time evolution numerically .",
    "however , our main goal is to obtain the transverse momentum spectra of the produced fermion pairs , thus we need to introduce the fermion distribution function .",
    "there is no straightforward way to define this distribution function , but we can find a phenomenological way , summarized in the next chapter .",
    "the energy density carried by the produced fermions is defined throughout the wigner function  @xcite : @xmath25 where the second term fixes the zero energy level to the physical value ( note , that expression ( [ energy ] ) is free from divergent vacuum contribution ) . here",
    "the one particle energy is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the trace is over color and spinor and the averaging is taken over momenta : @xmath27 after the color and spinor decomposition one obtains @xmath28 in parallel , focusing on one - particle distribution function the usual energy density formula has the following form : @xmath29 note , that both averages ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ usual ] ) may contain ultraviolet divergence , that can be properly regularized ( for abelian fields see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since we are not going to calculate bulk properties of produced pairs , the issue of regularization is not important in current consideration and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "now , combining eq.([energy_after_decompos ] ) and eq.([usual ] ) one can derive phenomenologically a distribution function , namely @xmath30 the time dependence in @xmath31 is connected to the time - evolution of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which is followed by solving the decomposed kinetic equation of eq .",
    "( [ wigner_gen ] ) .",
    "the fermion distribution function should be zero in vacuum .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) satisfies this request .",
    "indeed the vacuum solution ( @xmath34 ) for the singlet wigner function has the following form ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath35 the vacuum solution for the multiplet wigner function is zero , @xmath36 .",
    "the substitution of this wigner function into the definition of the distribution function in eq.([df ] ) leads to @xmath37 in vacuum , which is physically correct .",
    "furthermore , one can see that @xmath31 is positive definite in presence of a non - zero field ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "although our fermion distribution function @xmath31 has been postulated phenomenologically and possibly it is not a unique solution , but it seems to be the right tool to investigate the time evolution of the energy distribution at the microscopical level in a space homogeneous environment .",
    "our basic aim is to determine the fermionic distribution function and its time evolution in the presence of a strong , time - dependent non - abelian su(2 ) field .",
    "for this task we need to substitute the color and spinor decomposed wigner function of eq .",
    "( [ color_decomposition ] ) into the kinetic equation in eq .",
    "( [ wigner_gen ] ) .",
    "after evaluating the color and spinor indeces we obtain a system of coupled differential equations , which consists of 32 components in su(2 ) : @xmath39 here we use the notation @xmath40 , and a similar one for @xmath41 .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor component of the wigner function is defined as @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the color electric field is @xmath43 .",
    "since the mass of light quarks is small will substitute the mass term @xcite , namely @xmath44 .",

    ". one can recognize that the second set completely defines the evolution of the fermion distribution function . this way the chiral symmetry of the massless case",
    "is manifested itself .",
    "thus we focus on these equations , only : @xmath50 the vacuum initial conditions are given by eq.([wfvac ] ) : @xmath51 the other components of the wigner function have zero initial values .",
    "the system of equations in ( [ partii_1])-([partii_6 ] ) can be solved numerically for different color configurations .",
    "thus the evolution of the color could be followed in detail , similarly to the color evolution in the wong yang - mills equations  @xcite",
    ". however , in the next section for the sake of simplicity we will consider assumption that the external field has a fixed direction in color space .",
    "the equations ( [ partii_1])-([partii_6 ] ) provides a full description of the fermion production in a time - dependent su(2 ) color field . here",

    "then the equations ( [ partii_1])-([partii_6 ] ) have the following particular solution : @xmath57 taking into account the zero initial conditions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the equations ( [ partii_5])-([partii_6 ] ) become trivial and do not contribute to the set of equations ( [ partii_1]-[partii_4 ] ) , the last simplifies to give @xmath60 introducing the unit vector collinear to the field direction , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , we can perform the following vector decomposition : @xmath63 finally we obtain 6 equations , only : @xmath64 these equations determine the time evolution of the wanted distribution function : @xmath65 the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ final_massles_iso_beg])-([final_massles_iso_end ] ) requires initial conditions . in our case",
    "the appropriate vacuum initial conditions are the following : @xmath66    now we have all parts to proceed numerically for any time - dependent field strength and determine the momentum distribution of the produced fermions .",
    "in heavy ion collisions , one can assume three different types of time dependence for the color field to be formed : a ) pulse - like field develops with a fast increase , which is followed by a fast fall in the field strength ; b ) formation of a constant field ( @xmath67 ) is maintained after the fast increase in the initial time period ; c ) scaled decrease of the field strength appears , which is caused by particle production and/or transverse expansion , and the decrease is elongated in time much further than the pulse - like assumption .",
