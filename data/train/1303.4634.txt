    "communication is the exchange of physical systems aimed at establishing correlations between the communicating parties . in most circumstances we are interested in the total amount of correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ the mutual information , between the sender and receiver  @xcite .",
    "information theory can thus be used to make statements governing any communication process  @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental of them claims that the gain of information achieved by communicating parties can not exceed the amount of information that is actually transmitted  @xcite . beside agreeing fully with everyday experience ,",
    "this adheres well with the expectation that in a communication protocol no form of correlation can be established without transmitting that kind of correlation .",
    "remarkably , quantum physics defies our intuition in this case too . as shown for the first time by cubitt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , quantum entanglement  @xcite , which is a purely non - classical type of correlation enabling tasks such as quantum teleportation  @xcite , secure cryptography  @xcite , improved communication complexity  @xcite , and quantum dense coding  @xcite , can be established between distant parties by exchanging a carrier system that , at all times , is not entangled with them .     with the carrier system @xmath0 , which is then sent to bob s site .",
    "if all the particles are quantum , it is possible to establish entanglement between their respective laboratories even though there was no initial entanglement between them and no entanglement is communicated .",
    "this is accomplished as follows : in step ( 1 ) , the fully separable initial state of the three systems is prepared . in step",
    "( 2 ) alice applies a suitable operation on @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which keeps the latter separable from the rest of the systems but creates entanglement between @xmath1 and joint system made out of @xmath2 and @xmath0 together . in step ( 3 ) , the unentangled carrier @xmath0 is transmitted to bob .",
    "as shown in panel ( 4 ) , this establishes entanglement between the laboratories of alice and bob . ]",
    "this result is particularly relevant for designing efficient methods to distribute entanglement across networks of non - interacting quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "two protocols have been identified to achieve this goal : the transfer of pre - available entanglement to chosen nodes of the network  @xcite , and the quantum communication scenario discussed above based on the exchange of a carrier quantum system . in the latter case , all the quantum algorithms relying on entanglement",
    "can actually be implemented without communicating any entanglement .    in such a scenario , the gain in entanglement between communicating sites is bounded from above @xcite by the amount of communicated nonclassical correlations as measured by quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "discord can be present also in separable states giving rise to the possibility of entanglement distribution via separable states .    here",
    "we demonstrate this concept experimentally by implementing the protocol proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite on a quantum optical platform based on the use of single - photon polarisation qubits . using the polarisation degree of freedom of a three - photon quantum register",
    ", we show that an initially separable , yet discorded , state of two photons can be transformed into an entangled one using only local operations that never generate entanglement between themselves and the communicated carrier photon .",
    "our experiment proves the tantalising possibility to establish quantum channels among the nodes of a quantum network without the need of previously available entangled resources .",
    "a typical communication scenario is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_comm ] .",
    "each of two distant parties , alice and bob , holds a quantum system , which we label @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . under the transmission of a carrier quantum system @xmath0 ,",
    "encoding communication from alice to bob , the information gain between their respective laboratories satisfies the inequality  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the information between alice and bob after bob has received system @xmath0 , @xmath5 is the information shared before the communication protocol , and @xmath6 is the actual information carried by @xmath0 . by introducing the quantum mutual information @xmath7 between two general systems @xmath8 and @xmath9 we can identify @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . as expected , the gain @xmath13 can not exceed the information carried by system @xmath0 , which is the communicated information .    a similar relation for quantum entanglement @xmath14 can not be stated : the entanglement gain is not bounded by the communicated entanglement but rather by the communicated quantum discord , a more general type of quantum correlations  @xcite . in particular , we can write @xmath15 where , using a notation similar to the one introduced before and indicating with @xmath16 the relative entropy of entanglement between systems @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to situations before and after the communication process , respectively . with these choices , in eq .   the communicated discord @xmath19 is quantified by the relative entropy of discord  @xcite , which is also known as the one - way quantum deficit  @xcite .",
    "the fact that discord quantifies a more general type of correlation opens up the possibility to create entanglement between remote parties via separable states alone .",
    "indeed , the bound in eq .",
    "( [ ent_gain ] ) is achieved in the protocol presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit in general the communicated discord does not provide a tight bound on the entanglement that is correspondingly gained  @xcite . to the best of our knowledges such",
    "a general tight bound is currently unknown .    in the protocol realised here , the two - level particles @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are prepared in a separable state @xmath20 that is a mixture of the four bell states @xmath21 ( each occurring with probability @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( with probability of occurrence @xmath24 ) .",
    "such a state is separable if and only if the highest probability in the mixture does not exceed @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the two - level carrier system @xmath0 is initially with alice and is uncorrelated from the other systems , so that the overall initial state is taken as @xmath26 . here",

    "alice now generates the state @xmath32 by applying a controlled - phase gate @xmath33 on her systems .",
    "the carrier qubit should remain separable from the other systems , _",
    "i.e. _ we require @xmath34 , while system @xmath1 should become entangled with the subsystem composed of @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( that is , we should have @xmath35 ) .",
    "finally , system @xmath0 is transmitted to bob and in this way the laboratories of alice and bob share entanglement .",
    "the description so far leaves room for the choice of the initial state , which should be taken as one that guarantees a sizeable degree of entanglement in the @xmath36 bipartition , keeping @xmath0 separable , after the protocol .",
    "a possible instance is given by the @xmath37 separable state @xmath38 which is a mixture of two - qubit states formed by the eigenstates @xmath39 of pauli operators @xmath40 , with eigenvalue @xmath41 .",
    "as a measure of entanglement we use the negativity @xmath42  @xcite , which is defined as the most negative eigenvalue of the matrix obtained from @xmath43 under partial transposition of system @xmath1  @xcite . within the class of initial states @xmath44",
    "on which one applies controlled - phase gate , the state built using eq .",
    "and @xmath45 gives @xmath46 , which is the highest amount of distributed entanglement via separable states .",
    "we choose to focus on the negativity because its presence in state @xmath43 guarantees that ( i ) the entanglement established between the sending and receiving laboratories can be localised into entanglement between systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 only using local operations performed at bob s site  @xcite , and ( ii ) such localised entanglement is distillable  @xcite . therefore , by repeating this protocol a sufficient number of times and performing entanglement distillation , one can in principle obtain maximally entangled pairs between alice and bob , although no entanglement has been shared between them .",

    "it is likely that such eigenvalues for the experimentally reconstructed states could have a ( small ) negative nominal value , which would make such instances compatible with entangled bipartitions . to conclusively prove that the bipartitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are separable , we add increasing amounts of white noise to the initial state , which thus becomes @xmath58)$ ] .",
    "white noise contributes no correlations , so this raises the value of the smallest eigenvalues of partially transposed density matrices , as shown in fig .",

    "a similar method was previously studied to assess the generation of bound - entangled states  @xcite .        for no added noise , the smallest eigenvalues of the partially transposed experimental states suggest that the protocol is successful : @xmath59 is clearly negative and both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are non - negative . however , as shown by the shaded bars in fig .",
    "[ fig_evalues]a , out of the @xmath54 states simulated for the error estimation only 17.4% have the required features at the relevant bipartitions . fig .",
    "[ fig_evalues]b shows that the proportion of such states rises rapidly with the addition of only a small amount of white noise : 96.5% of the sampled matrices fulfil the requirements for a successful protocol already at @xmath62 . note that this is a conservative estimate : as the histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig_evalues]c make clear , the data ( indicated by the solid coloured bars ) consistently lie in the upper part of the estimated error range .",
    "this skew can be understood by considering the fidelity of the experimental state at @xmath62 with the ideal state , @xmath49 .",
    "as the nominal value of the fidelity is very close to unity ( @xmath63 ) , simulating a poisson distribution with limited count statistics is likely to lead to lower fidelities , pushing the estimates to below the measured values , see fig .",
    "[ fig_evalues]d .",
    "the minimum eigenvalues of the partially transposed experimental states at maximum amount of added noise are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . by repeating the limited - count analysis in an otherwise ideal case , in the appendix 3 we show that the skew and the clear splitting between the positive values seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_evalues]a are not artefacts of imperfect state preparation or gate operation . moreover , in order to exclude the possibility of entanglement distribution via bound entangled states  @xcite , in appendix 2 we also provide the explicit decomposition of the experimental states in terms of convex sums of separable states of the @xmath57 bipartition .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated that distillable entanglement can be established between parties who exchange only unentangled systems . the success of our protocol is confirmed by the thorough data analysis performed in our study , which proves unambiguously the entangled nature of the @xmath67 bipartition and the separability of the other two . needless to say ,",
    "an equally interesting albeit weaker statement on entanglement distribution via bound - entangled states would be possible by having @xmath57 a bipartition with positive partial transposition yet not separable .",
    "our experiment demonstrates that entanglement - based quantum information protocols can be executed without communication of entanglement and might pave the way to bypassing the detrimental effects of noisy mechanisms affecting a quantum channel .",

    "the carrier qubit is initially in the state : @xmath81 after applying a controlled - phase gate on qubits @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the overall system s state becomes @xmath82 where the density matrix is written in the standard basis and the dots represent zeros .",
    "this state is entangled across the cut @xmath67 as revealed by the partial transposition criterion : the smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding partially transposed density matrix equals @xmath83 .",
    "the state is also separable across the @xmath57 cut , as shown by the following explicit decomposition into product states for this bipartition where    @xmath84    @xmath85 represents the standard bell basis and @xmath86 .",
    "in the experiment , additionally to producing states close to the ideal state @xmath49 , we also prepared the set of states with increasing amount of admixed white noise .",
    "all of such states are entangled in the cut @xmath67 , as demonstrated in the main text by the existence of a negative eigenvalue in the spectrum of the matrix obtained after partial transposition of @xmath1 .",
    "figure 4a of the main text also shows that the other two cuts are associated with states having positive eigenvalues after partial transpositions . as this criterion is not a necessary and sufficient one for three - qubit states",
    ", this does not exclude the possibility of having bound entanglement in the one of the cuts that is positive under partial transposition .",
    "therefore , in order to exclude the possibility of performing entanglement distribution via bound entangled states , we explicitly show separability across the bipartition @xmath57 by constructing a separable decomposition of the corresponding states , in analogy with eq . . to this end , we use the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "we generate a set of random product states for the chosen cut and use them to complement the set of product state vectors that enter the decomposition given in eq .  .",
    "we write a separable state as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a label for the chosen separable states @xmath89 discussed at step 1 ) , and @xmath90 are the associated probabilities of occurrence ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we equate this expression with the experimental state and numerically solve for @xmath90 s .    only about @xmath92 product states are sufficient to find explicitly the separable decompositions of all experimental density matrices reported in the main manuscript and thus wash out any possibility for bound entanglement .",
    "the protocol is thus faithfully based on the use of separable states .",
    "our error analysis showed that our data points , fig .",
    "4 , lie slightly outside the most likely range obtained via the standard method for single - photon experiments : maximum - likelihood estimation of states with simulated poissonian noise added to the obtained photon counts .",
