    "in one of the most popular scenarios ( e.g. hopkins et al . 2008 ) , the tidal torques generated by major mergers funnel gas into the center of galaxies , leading to a central starburst and rapid growth of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",

    "this picture establishes the evolutionary connections between ulirgs , quasars , and massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) are thought to be the analogues of local ulirgs at high redshift ( blain et al .",

    "although most smgs host growing black holes ( e.g. , alexander et al . 2005 , 2008 ) , their luminosities are normally dominated by star formation ( swinbank et al .",

    "it has been proposed that both smgs and dogs are an early phase of galaxy merging , with smgs representing an earlier , starburst - dominant phase , while luminous dogs are in a transitional phase from starburst - dominated to agn - dominated ( e.g. narayanan 2010 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosities also reach their maximum during these phases , making the most luminous galaxies in these phases also among the most luminous objects in the universe .    looking for the most luminous galaxies in the universe",

    "most of the redshifts are between 2 and 3 , suggesting they also trace the peak epoch of cosmic star formation and qso activity . at these redshifts ,",
    "such high flux densities at 22 @xmath2 m imply extremely high luminosities .",
    "they are potentially hyperluminous galaxies . in order to understand the dust properties and calculate the total luminosities of these unusual galaxies , continuum measurements at longer wavelengths are crucial .",
    "as the first high redshift examples were identified , we began follow - up 0.35 - 1.1 mm continuum observations using the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , in order to construct their seds and to explore the nature of w12drop galaxies .    in this paper , we report the initial results of this follow - up study .",

    "the selection criteria for w12drops use wise catalog photometry , which provides psf - ftting ( i.e. total ) magnitudes and uncertainties in the vega system .",

    "the submillimeter high angular resolution camera ii ( sharc - ii ) installed at the 10.4 m cso telescope ( dowell et al . 2002 ) is a background - limited 350 and 450 @xmath2 m facility camera , and it is also equipped with a filter that allows 850 @xmath2 m continuum observations .",
    "it adopts a `` ccd - style '' bolometer array with 12 @xmath32 32 pixels , resulting in a 0.97@xmath33 field of view .",
    "the fwhm beam sizes of sharc - ii at 350 @xmath2 m , 450 @xmath2 m , and 850 @xmath2 m are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we used sharc - ii to follow - up 14 high redshift w12drop galaxies during runs in july and september of 2010 , and in february and september of 2011 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "most of the targets were only observed at 350 @xmath2 m , with a few also observed at 450 @xmath2 m and 850 @xmath2 m .",
    "examples of sharc - ii images of detected w12drop galaxies are presented in figure 1 . since the 350 and 450 @xmath2 m atmospheric transmission is very sensitive to the weather , we only observed targets under good weather conditions ( i.e. when the opacity at 225 ghz @xmath37 , which occurs @xmath38 20% of the time ) .",
    "the targets and observing information are listed in table 1 .",
    "the dish surface optimization system ( dsos , leong 2006 ) was used to correct the dish surface figure for imperfections and gravitational deformations as the dish moved in elevation during observations .",
    "we used the comprehensive reduction utility for sharc - ii ( crush , kovcs 2006 ) , version crush2.01 - 4 , to reduce the sharc - ii data .",
    "option `` -deep '' in crush was applied to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for faint ( @xmath31 100 mjy ) point sources .",
    "planets uranus and neptune , when available , were used for flux calibration , focus correction and pointing correction , and secondary calibrators such as k3 - 50 and crl618 were used when these planets were not available . in order to flux calibrate , we used the starlink s `` astro '' package to calculate the flux density of the calibrator within the proper beam size for a sharc - ii band , and the `` show '' package in crush to obtain the readout flux density of the observed calibrator .",
    "the calibration factors ( peaks ) were derived by dividing the real peak flux density of the calibrator by the readout peak flux density from crush within one beam .",
    "the flux density of the target and the rms noise were then derived by applying this calibration factor to the readout of the peak position of the target and off - peak positions 1 - 2 beams from the peak , using the crush `` show '' package in the same way as for the calibrator , and convolving with the same beam size .",
    "the statistics of the calibration factor over all our runs indicates a calibration uncertainty of 20% .",
    "we used the sweep mode for the sharc - ii observations , in which the telescope moves in a lissajous pattern that keeps the central regions of the maps fully sampled .",
    "the edges are much noisier than the central regions , and to compensate for this , we used `` imagetool '' in crush to eliminate the regions of each map that had a total exposure time less than 25@xmath39 of the maximum .",
    "pointing was checked every hour with planets and secondary calibrators .",
    "the pointing drift was normally less than 3@xmath40 in both the azimuth and zenith directions between pointing checks , and a pointing correction has been applied during the data stacking .",
    "the uncertainty on the centroid position of an object will be the quadrature sum of the pointing uncertainty and the measurement uncertainty on the centroid , which approximately equals to the beam fwhm divided by s / n .",
    "given our sharc - ii detections normally have s / n of 3 - 4 , and beam size at 350@xmath4 is @xmath34 , the measurement uncertainty on the centroid for our targets is about 2@xmath40 - 3 @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of offset between the sharc - ii centroids and wise positions should be less than 5@xmath40 - 6 @xmath40 , which is consistent with our sharc - ii detections ( figure 1 ) .",
    "bolocam is a large format camera at the cso with 144 detectors , a circular eight - arcmin - diameter field of view ( fov ) , an observing band centered at 1.1 mm , and a point - spread function with a 30 arcsec full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) ( haig et al .",
    "eighteen w12drop galaxies were observed with bolocam during runs in june 2010 , december 2010 , febuary 2011 , and september 2011 , with observing information listed in table 1 .",
    "the observations were made by scanning the cso in a lissajous pattern , with scanning parameters chosen to keep the source within the fov 100% of the time ( sayers et al .",
    "2011 ) while scanning at an average speed of 2@xmath41/sec in june 2010 , december 2010 and february 2011 and an average speed of 4 @xmath41/sec in september 2011 .",
    "a pointing model , accurate to 5@xmath40 , was created from frequent observations of bright objects within @xmath42 degrees of the target galaxies following the methods described in sayers et al .",

    "the uranus calibration model of griffin and orton 1993 was updated based on the 143  ghz bolocam results described in sayers et al . 2012 .",
    "we estimate the flux calibration to be accurate to @xmath43 .",
    "our atmospheric noise subtraction procedure was based on the algorithms described in sayers et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , with the following modifications : 1 ) an adaptive principal component analysis ( pca ) algorithm was used to subtract the correlated atmospheric signal over the fov ( laurent et al .",
    "2005 , downes et al .",
    "2012 ) and 2 ) the data were then high - pass filtered at a characteristic frequency of 400 mhz , which corresponds to an angular scale of 5@xmath41 and 10@xmath41 for the data collected at 2@xmath41/sec and 4@xmath41/sec . as described in detail in sayers et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the atmospheric noise subtraction also attenuated the astronomical signal . to account for this signal attenuation",
    ", observations of the flux calibration sources were processed in an identical way prior to determining the flux calibration .",
    "although the adaptive pca algorithm is non - linear , we verified via simulation that the combination of adaptive pca and a 400 mhz high - pass filter results in a constant fractional amount of signal attenuation for point - like objects with flux densities @xmath44 jy , which is well above the flux density of any of our flux calibration sources .",
    "we estimated the noise in our images via jackknife realizations of our data following the methods described in sayers et al .",
    "these jackknifes involve multiplying a randomly selected subset of half of our data by -1 . by adding these jackknifes together we preserve the noise properties of the data while removing the astronomical signal .",
    "in addition to instrumental and atmospheric noise , some of our images also contain a non - negligible amount of noise due to fluctuations in the astronomical ( back)foregrounds . using the galaxy number counts model in bethermin & dole ( 2011 ) , we estimate the confusion noise ( quantified by the rms noise fluctuations on beam size scales ) to be 0.6 mjy , which is approximately the confusion noise measured at the same wavelength / resolution with aztec ( scott et al .",
    "2010 ) . the total uncertainty on the flux density of a galaxy is then given by the quadrature sum of instrument / measurement noise and confusion noise",
    ". the noise fluctuations in the map are gaussian within our ability to measure them . for our non - detections we quote 95% confidence level upper limits based on the formalism given in feldman and cousins ( 1998 ) , who provided a rigorous method for quoting upper limits from a measurement with gaussian noise and a physical constraint that the true underlying value is non - negative ( which is the case for our measurements , since negative flux densities are unphysical ) .",
    "specifically , our upper limits are computed from the values given in table 10 of feldman and cousins ( 1998 ) .",
    "we obtained optical spectroscopy of the wise - selected sources over the course of four observing runs between july 2010 and february 2011 .",

    "observations were generally obtained at a position angle that placed a brighter offset star on the slit . since lris has an atmospheric dispersion corrector , there are no issues with lost light due to observing at non - parallactic angles .",

    "their seds apparently peak at significantly shorter wavelengths than other galaxy templates , indicating hotter average dust temperatures .      in order to understand the nature of the w12drop galaxies , we need to estimate their luminosities and dust temperatures .",
    "the standard method to do this is to fit several black - body models with wavelength - dependent opacities to fit sed points along a large range of wavelengths , to constrain both temperatures and luminosities .",
    "we already know that w12drop galaxies have unusually high mid - ir to submm ratios , and that the major luminosity comes from 24@xmath4 to 350@xmath4 emission ( see figure 5 ) , so this is clearly the key wavelength range to characterize . at redshift 2 - 3 ,",
    "the irac [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] bands ( rest wavelength 0.8 - 1.5 @xmath2 m ) may be significantly affected by stellar light , and at longer wavelengths , we see indications that these w12drop galaxies may have components in addition to a hot - dust component ( see section 4 ) .    in many cases infrared - luminous galaxies are dominated by one major dust component , and can be approximated by a single - temperature modified blackbody model .",
    "for example , a single dust temperature model provides a good description of the far - ir and submm / mm seds of smgs ( e.g. magnelli et al .",
    "2012 ) , with typical dust temperatures of 30 - 40 k ( chapman et al . 2005 , kovcs et al . 2006 , coppin et al . 2008 , wu et al . 2009 , magnelli et al . 2012 ) .",
    "most dogs can also be described by a single - temperature model with dust temperatures of 20 - 40 k ( melbourne et al . 2012 ) .",
    "because the peak of the w12drop seds is not well sampled in the data presented here , it is unclear whether their 24@xmath4 to 350@xmath4 emission can be well described by a single - temperature model , and we are obtaining _ herschel _ data to better determine this . in this paper",
    "we use a single - temperature model to describe the bulk of the emission from w12drops .",
    "we apply a single temperature , modified black - body model combined with a power - law model , to fit the mid - ir to mm seds . at lower frequencies we use @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is",
    "the plank function and @xmath72 is the dust emissivity index with @xmath73 , attached smoothly to which at higher frequencies is a power - law with @xmath74 .",
    "the two portions are joined at the frequency when the modified black - body slope equals that of the power - law ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the @xmath57 parameter and dust temperature @xmath75 are constrained by w3 , w4 and 350@xmath2 m data , as well as 450@xmath2 m , 850@xmath2 m and 1.1 mm data when available .",
    "these data do not absolutely determine the shape of the sed , but the combination of the @xmath57 and @xmath75 parameters provide a reasonable measure of the peak frequency of the sed . in table 4 , we give the derived dust temperatures and mid - ir power - law indexes from this model .",
    "the derived dust temperatures of w12drops range from 60 k to 123 k , with a median value of 94 k. we applied this same model to calculate dust temperatures for dogs in bo@xmath76tes field , using similar data from melbourne et al .",
    "we used their reported irac 8@xmath4 and mips 24@xmath4 data in place of w3 and w4 to calculate @xmath57 , together with their spire 350 and 500 @xmath4 data to estimate the dust temperature .",
    "we obtained similar dust temperatures to the 20 - 40 k reported by melbourne et al .",
    "this confirms that w12drop galaxies are much hotter than typical dogs .",
    "our single - temperature model also provides a luminosity when @xmath57 , @xmath72 and t are fixed .",
    "however this luminosity is sensitive to the data points close to the peak , which is not well sampled here .",
    "therefore instead , we use a simple , but conservative method to estimate the total luminosity , which is to simply connect the data points of all the available sed points with power - laws , and integrate the total flux densities .",
    "this method may miss the luminosity close to the peak of the sed , so it provides a lower bound to the true luminosity .",
    "we list the conservative total luminosity calculated between 2 - 1000 @xmath2 m in table 4 .",
    "the derived total luminosities range from 1.7 @xmath77 ( w0211@xmath302242 ) , to 1.8 @xmath78 ( w0410@xmath300913 ) , confirming that these galaxies are very luminous , well above the @xmath79 threshold for hylirgs .",
    "our cso follow - up observations of 26 w12drop galaxies show that their luminosities are very high , with some over @xmath80 , and a median and mean of 5.7 and 6.1 @xmath77 , all using the conservative power - law method .",
    "this is roughly an order of magnitude brighter than the typical smg ( with median luminosity @xmath81 , chapman et al .",
    "2005 , kovcs et al .",
    "2006 ) , or dog ( with median and mean luminosity @xmath82 and @xmath83 , melbourne et al .",
    "2012 ) , and is comparable to the brightest known optically selected quasars ( schneider et al . 2005 ) .",
    "extremely luminous infrared galaxies are often found to be magnified by galaxy - galaxy lensing ( blain 1996 , eisenhardt et al .",
    "1996 , solomon & vanden bout 2005 , vieira et al .",
    "2010 , negrello et al .",
    "an immediate concern about the hyperluminous w12drop galaxies is whether they are lensed , too .",
    "however , high - resolution imaging follow - up of selected w12drops does not indicate gravitational lensing ( eisenhardt et al .",
    "2012 , bridge et al . in prep .",
    ") , so that the derived @xmath84 luminosities are consistent with being intrinsic based on the current data .",
    "additional high - resolution follow - up observations with hubble space telescope are currently underway , and should reveal if these w12drop galaxies are not lensed . if the lack of lensing is confirmed , these galaxies are one of the most luminous populations in the universe .",
    "their unusually high dust temperatures and extremely high luminosities make w12drop galaxies of great interest for studying galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "how do they become so luminous ?",
    "are they experiencing special evolutionary events ? what is their relationship to other well - established galaxy populations , such as smgs and dogs ?",
    "classical smgs are defined with strong 850@xmath2 m emission ( @xmath28 5mjy ) which normally indicates significant cold - dust content .",
    "table 3 gives examples of some w12drop galaxies that meet this criterion .",
    "hence some w12drop galaxies would be selected as smgs .",
    "however , the relatively low detection rate with bolocam at 1.1 mm implies that many w12drop galaxies are not as bright as smgs at longer wavelengths .",
    "this is understandable given that w12drop galaxies are dominated by emission from hotter dust .",
    "dogs normally have both agn and starburst contributions , with warmer dust grains than smgs . in dey",

    "taking the average power - law index @xmath57 of 2.09 from table 4 and extrapolating to @xmath85-band and 24 @xmath2 m , the difference between the @xmath85-w4 and @xmath16-[24 ] color ranges from 0.2 to 0.24 mag as @xmath16-[24 ] changes from 14 to 17 .",
    "all 18 targets in table 3 that are covered by sdss dr8 meet the @xmath85-w4 @xmath28 14 dog criterion , with @xmath85-w4 ranging from 14.4 to 16.1 for @xmath85-band detected sources , and @xmath85-w4 @xmath28 15.3 for @xmath85-band undetected sources ( using @xmath85=22.9 vega mag as the sdss detection limit ) . in figure 6",
    "we compare the distribution of @xmath16 vs. @xmath16-[24 ] for these high - redshift w12drops to dogs in d08 .",
    "clearly all w12drop galaxies in table 3 qualify as dogs , with similar colors , but are much brighter at 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "although many and maybe most w12drop galaxies can be classified as dogs , their properties are quite different from normal dogs . comparing to the dogs reported in d08 , w12drop galaxies have an order of magnitude higher luminosity , although their redshift distributions are similar ( eisenhardt et al . 2012 ) .",
    "bussmann et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used sharc - ii at 350 @xmath2 m to follow - up a subset of dogs with the brightest 24 @xmath2 m flux densities from d08 ( fig 6 ) , obtaining infrared luminosities ( 8 - 1000@xmath2 m , @xmath87 ) and dust temperatures ( @xmath2830 - 60 k ) , still significantly lower than for the w12drop galaxies reported here .",
    "since the d08 survey covered only @xmath88 9 deg@xmath89 ( bo@xmath76tes field ) , the dog surface density is @xmath38 320 dogs per square degree with 24 @xmath2 m fluxes density greater than 0.3 mjy .",
    "the w12drop selection requires w4 @xmath28 7 mjy , which is at the high 24 @xmath2 m flux density end of the d08 sample , and only selects @xmath38 1000 targets over the whole sky .",
    "the typical dogs are 20 times fainter than the w12drops , but the latter are about 10000 times rarer .",
    "the high - z w12drop galaxies are apparently extreme cases of dogs with very high dust obscuration and hotter dust temperatures , and appear to be hyperluminous , hot dogs .",
    "the very low surface density of w12drop galaxies suggests either they are intrinsically extremely rare , or are only seen during a very short phase of galaxy evolution .",
    "dogs are thought to be the transitional phase of mergers between starburst - dominated mode and agn - dominated modes . based on the mid - ir sed ( 3.6 - 24 @xmath2 m ) , d08 classified dogs into two categories , those which have a distinct `` bump '' in their sed between 3 - 10 @xmath2 m attributed to the redshifted starlight from rest - frame 1.6 @xmath2 m , and those whose mid - ir sed is a power - law .",
    "bump dogs are thought to be dominated by starbursts ( yan et al .",

    "2006 , donley et al .",
    "2007 , yan et al .",
    "2007 , murphy et al .",
    "2009 ) , and make up most of the bright end of the 24@xmath2 m flux density distribution .",
    "the fraction of power - law dogs increases from 10% at @xmath90 mjy to 60% at @xmath91 mjy in the _ spitzer _ deep , wide - field survey ( ashby et al .",
    "the mid - ir ( mips 24 @xmath4 ) to submm ( spire 250 @xmath4 ) flux density ratio for power - law dogs is found to be similar to the agn dominated ulirg mrk231 ( melbourne et al .",
    "the irac1 to w4 seds of w12drops ( fig .",
    "5 ) are more like the mid - ir seds of dogs rather than smgs ( hainline et al . 2009 ) .",
    "they show typical power - law shapes with no obvious bumps , and are very bright at 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "consequently , it is plausible that w12drop galaxies are also dominated by very powerful agns .",
    "these powerful , highly obscured agns can heat the surrounding dust cocoon to a very high temperature .",
    "although the seds of w12drops are dominated by emission from very hot dust components ( figure 5 ) that are likely contributed by powerful agns , a hot agn component alone ca nt explain all of the observed sed from the mid - ir to millimeter bands .",
    "it is likely that the seds are composed of multiple components with different temperatures .",
    "a more detailed model to decompose seds with multiple - temperature components needs a more complete set of sed data , which will become available from our ongoing _",
    "herschel _ program .",
    "but the 350@xmath2 m and 1.1 mm data reported in this paper can give a useful constraint on the coldest component , if we assume that the 350 @xmath2 m to 1.1 mm sed is tracing the coldest dust in these galaxies . in figure 7 , we plot the modeled flux density ratios of 350 @xmath2 m to 1.1 mm continuum versus the redshifts , for models with a single - temperature black - body times a wavelength - dependent opacity , with various dust temperatures and emissivities . w12drop galaxies with available 350 @xmath2 m and 1.1 mm measurements are plotted in the figure . for comparison ,",
    "models based on galaxies with significant starburst components ( arp220 and mrk231 ) are also plotted . for @xmath72 between 1.5 and 2.0 , the 350 @xmath2 m to 1.1 mm ratios of w12drop galaxies in figure 7",
    "apparently favor a model with t@xmath92 less than 50 k , in addition to the @xmath38 100 k hot dust component that dominates the mid - ir .",
    "this temperature of colder dust is comparable to the typical dust temperature of @xmath3835 k associated with starburst galaxies ( such as arp220 ) .",
    "considering that the very hot agn component will contribute more to the continuum at 350@xmath2 m than at 1.1 mm , the actual 350 @xmath2 m to 1.1 mm ratios that trace the coldest dust could be lower , and therefore closer to the track of arp220 or mrk231 in figure 7 .",
    "this may imply that the cold dust component in these galaxies is not very different from those in starburst galaxies , and is possibly related to star formation .",
    "for example , in the detailed study of the first discovered w12drop galaxy ( w1814 + 3412 , eisenhardt et al .",
    "2012 ) , a significant starburst is found , although only contributing a small fraction to the overall luminosity .",
    "the cold dust properties of w12drop galaxies may also be different from known obscured qsos ( e.g. martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "the ratio of 350 @xmath2 m to 1.1 mm in ams16 , a high - z obscured quasar , is lower than for w12drops , as plotted in figure 7 .",
    "a detailed study of the long - wavelength properties for these w12drop galaxies , for instance , to distinguish the contribution and distribution of cold dust ( star formation ) and hot dust ( agn ) , will need observations from alma as well as _",
    "the similarity between the optical to 22 @xmath2 m seds of dogs and w12drop galaxies , with the latter being much brighter , suggests w12drops may be the high luminosity tail of the dog distribution .",
    "but the high mid - ir to submm luminosity ratio of w12drops implies they are much hotter than typical dogs . are these w12drops merely luminous dogs , or a distinct population ? or do they have any evolutionary connection ? some theoretical models for dogs ( e.g. narayanan et al .",
    "2010 ) propose that smgs , bump dogs , and power - law dogs may form an evolutionary sequence , representing the transition of merging galaxies from a starburst - dominated phase to an agn - dominated phase , although direct observational support for this is still rare . in figure 4a , we see a strong correlation between the mid - ir flux density and the mid - ir to submm luminosity ratio that supports such a sequence , with w12drops at the highest luminosities .",
    "the correlation is roughly linear , suggesting the cold dust component ( traced by 350@xmath4 emission which may be from a starburst ) does nt change significantly during this process , as clearly shown in figure 4b , while the hot dust component ( traced by 24@xmath4 ) becomes stronger , possibly tracing the growth of an embedded smbh . in this scenario , w12drops represent a late phase of this evolution , with more massive smbhs and similar cold - dust components to smgs and dogs .",
    "if so , the low surface density of w12drops suggests either such a phase is very short , or not every galaxy goes through this stage",
    ". a better understanding of whether the populations have an evolutionary connection will need a fuller study of the w12drop population , and of the luminosity function of all these populations .",

    "the seds constructed from wise , warm _",

    "their seds have unusually high mid - ir to submm luminosity ratios , indicating a hotter dust temperature than other populations",
    ". their seds can not be well fit with existing galaxy templates , indicating they are likely a new population .",

    ", they may also have colder dust components that are similar to starburst galaxies .",
    "w12drop galaxies in this paper would also be selected as dogs , but are at least 10 times more luminous and 10000 times rarer",
