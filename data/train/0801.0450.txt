    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that hadronic matter at high temperatures and/or high densities undergoes a phase transition to a system of deconfined partonic matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "matter under such extreme conditions can be studied in the laboratory by colliding nuclei at very high energies .",
    "the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory has provided a variety of collision systems at different beam energies , including collisions of au+au , @xmath6+au and @xmath19 at @xmath7 = 200 gev .",
    "resonances are strongly decaying particles with lifetimes @xmath26 @xmath25 that are of the order of the size of the hot and dense medium produced in heavy - ion collisions . as such , the measurement of resonances in au+au collisions compared to @xmath19 collisions at @xmath7 = 200 gev has provided detailed information about the interaction dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , where hadronic lifetimes and interaction cross - sections affect the resonance yields @xcite .",
    "the in - medium effects related to the high density and/or high temperature of the medium can modify the properties of short - lived resonances , such as their masses , widths , and even their spectral shapes @xcite .",
    "thus , resonances provide a unique tool for studying various properties of interaction dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . a good understanding of resonance production in the reference systems @xmath19 and @xmath6+au is useful in understanding resonance production in au+au collisions .",
    "comparisons between @xmath19 and au+au for the @xmath21 and @xmath27 mesons have been made elsewhere @xcite , where it was observed that there were modifications of the resonance properties ( mass and width ) in both systems with respect to values in the vacuum in the absence of any medium effects .",
    "the measurement of masses and widths of resonances in @xmath6+au collisions add further information to the existing measurements .",
    "in addition , the regeneration of resonances and the re - scattering of their daughters are two competing effects that affect the interpretation of resonance production .",
    "resonances that decay before kinetic freeze - out ( vanishing elastic collisions ) may not be reconstructed due to the re - scattering of the daughter particles . in this case , the resonance survival probability is relevant and depends on the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - outs , the source size , and the resonance transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) . on the other hand , after chemical freeze - out ( vanishing inelastic collisions ) , elastic interactions may increase the resonance population compensating for the ones that decay before kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the case of resonance regeneration depends on the hadronic cross - section of their daughters .",
    "thus , the study of resonances can provide an independent probe of the time evolution of the source from chemical to kinetic freeze - out and detailed information on hadronic interaction at later stages .",
    "this has been measured in au+au and compared to @xmath19 for the @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and @xmath28 @xcite resonances .",
    "now , with the addition of the @xmath6+au measurement we can gain insight into the re - scattering processes in @xmath19 and au+au collisions .    in this paper , we present the first measurements of @xmath29(770)@xmath30 , @xmath1(892 ) , @xmath2(1232)@xmath3 , @xmath4(1385 ) , and @xmath5(1520 ) in @xmath6+au collisions at @xmath7 = 200 gev at rhic reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels using the star detector .",

    "a minimum bias trigger was defined by requiring that at least one beam - rapidity neutron impinges on the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) @xcite in the au beam direction .",
    "the measured minimum bias cross - section amounts to @xmath35 of the total @xmath6+au geometric cross - section . charged particle multiplicity within the pseudorapidity interval @xmath36 was measured in a forward tpc ( ftpc ) @xcite in the au beam direction and served as the basis of our @xmath6+au centrality tagging scheme , as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6+au centrality definition consists of three event centrality classes ; 0 - 20@xmath37 , 20 - 40@xmath37 , and 40 - 100@xmath37 of the total @xmath6+au cross - section @xcite .",
    "the analysis of different centralities was restricted to events with a primary vertex within 50 cm of the center of the tpc along the beam direction to ensure uniform acceptance in the @xmath38 range studied . for the minimum bias events ,",
    "the ftpc was not used , so events with a primary vertex within 100 cm were accepted , still maintaining a uniform acceptance in the @xmath38 range studied . in order to improve the statistics in the case of the @xmath1(892 ) , events with a primary vertex within 75 cm were accepted for the centrality studies . the difference between using 50 and 75 cm as the primary vertex cut was taken into account in the systematic errors .",
