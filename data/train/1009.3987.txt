    "a new morphological class of supernova remnants ( snrs ) known as the mixed - morphology ( mm ) snrs has been firmly established in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "the defining characteristics of snrs of this class include a shell - like radio morphology combined with a centrally - filled x - ray morphology .",
    "x - ray observations of these snrs made with the @xmath13 ( _ rosat _ ) , the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ asca _ ) , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have found that the central x - ray emission from these snrs is not non - thermal emission ( as would be expected from a central plerion ) but instead thermal from shock - heated swept - up interstellar material",
    ". examples of well - known mm snrs include w28 @xcite , g290.1@xmath140.8 ( msh 11@xmath146@xmath15a ) @xcite and ic 443 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that as many as 25% of the entire population of galactic snrs may belong to this morphological class .",
    "based on co and infrared observations @xcite , it appears that many mm snrs are interacting with nearby molecular and hi clouds .",
    "this result suggests a connection between the contrasting x - ray and radio morphologies of these snrs with the interaction between these sources and adjacent clouds , but such a connection lacks a detailed theoretical basis at this time .",
    "two leading scenarios have been advanced to explain the origin of the contrasting radio and x - ray morphologies of mm snrs : in the first scenario  known as the evaporating clouds scenario  molecular clouds overrun by the expanding shock front of the snr survive passage through the shock and eventually evaporate , providing a source of material that increases the density of the interior x - ray - emitting plasma of the snr @xcite . in the second scenario  known as the radiative shell model  the snr has evolved to an advanced stage where the shock temperature is low and very soft x - ray emission from the shell is absorbed by the interstellar medium ( ism ) :",
    "therefore , the only detectable x - ray emission is from the interior of the snr @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we analyze and discuss x - ray emission from two galactic snrs  hb21 and ctb 1  which have both been previously classified as mm snrs by @xcite .",
    "hb21 ( g89.0@xmath04.7 ) was discovered in a radio survey by @xcite .",
    "the radio angular extent of this snr is large ",
    "120@xmath490 arcminutes @xcite  and the radio morphology is a closed shell .",
    "the shell appears to be flattened along the eastern boundary and features bright regions along the northern and southern boundaries with a prominent indentation seen along the northern boundary .",
    "the radio emission from hb21 is strongly polarized ( 3.7@xmath16@xmath170.4@xmath16 ) with a projected magnetic field tangential to the shell @xcite , suggesting that the shell was compressed during the radiative evolutionary stage of the snr .",
    "the measured radio spectral index for this snr is @xmath18 @xmath3 0.4 ( @xmath19 ) @xcite but significant variations in the values ( from 0.0 - 0.8 with a standard deviation of 0.16 ) of the spectral index across the face of the snr were observed by @xcite . based on _ iras _ observations , @xcite detected clumpy infrared filaments associated with this snr .",
    "filamentary optical emission from this snr with an angular extent comparable to the radio shell was detected by @xcite .",
    "extensive evidence exists that indicates hb21 is interacting with adjacent molecular clouds : this evidence includes co observations @xcite as well as near- and mid - infrared observations of the sites of shock - molecular cloud interactions along the northern and southern parts of the snr @xcite .",
    "hi observations toward hb21 @xcite have revealed a high velocity expanding shell associated with this snr .",
    "finally , hb21 has been the subject of prior pointed x - ray observations made by _ einstein _ @xcite and _ rosat _ @xcite : we include in this paper the _ rosat _ images presented previously by @xcite in her phd thesis work .",
    "no pulsars or @xmath20-ray sources are believed to be associated with hb21 : radio searches for a pulsar associated with this snr were conducted by @xcite and @xcite but no candidate sources were found .",
    "the distance to hb21 is not well known : @xcite argued for a distance of only 0.8 kpc based on an association between the snr and molecular material that belongs to the cygnus ob7 association @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested a distance of @xmath211.6 kpc based on a correlation that those authors found between x - ray absorbing column density and extinction , and @xcite suggested a distance of 1.7 kpc based on co observations . in this paper",
    ", we have adopted a distance of 1.7 kpc to hb21 .",
    "ctb 1 ( g116.9@xmath00.2 ) was discovered in a survey of galactic radio emission at 960 mhz by @xcite .",
    "subsequent radio observations of this snr @xcite reveal a radio morphology that may be described as a nearly complete circular shell with a diameter of approximately 34 arcminutes @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is brightest along the western rim and a prominent gap is seen along the northern and northeastern sector of the circular emission . like hb21 , the magnetic field",
    "is aligned in the tangential direction , also suggesting that the shell was compressed during the radiative stage of the evolution of the snr , but compared to hb21 the degree of polarization is much lower ( 0.4%@xmath170.1%  see @xcite ) .",
    "the measured spectral index of the observed radio emission is @xmath18 @xmath3 0.6 @xcite .",
    "ctb 1 has also been detected at optical wavelengths , in emission lines such as [ oiii ] @xmath225007 and [ sii ] @xmath23 6716 , 6731 ; the observed optical shell - like morphology closely matches the radio shell .",
    "the optical images of ctb 1 presented by @xcite depict a remarkable contrast in the emission - line properties of this snr : while [ sii ] emission is seen from roughly the entire optical shell ( with the greatest amount of emission in the south ) , the [ oiii ] emission appears to be almost entirely localized to the western rim of the shell .",
    "@xcite detected infrared emission from ctb 1 in the 60 @xmath24 m and 100 @xmath24 m _ iras _ bands : an arc of infrared emission was seen in the 60 @xmath24m/100 @xmath24 m ratio image that appears to be coincident with the radio shell .",
    "ctb 1 was observed in x - rays with _ rosat _",
    "@xcite : like other mm snrs , the x - ray emission from this snr ( which has a thermal origin ) lies interior to the radio and optical shells .",
    "remarkably , the x - ray emission is also seen to extend through the known northern gap of the snr .",
    "like hb21 , no pulsars or @xmath20-ray sources are believed to be associated with ctb 1 : a radio search conducted by @xcite for a pulsar revealed no candidate sources .",
    "published distance estimates for this snr have ranged from 1.6 to 3.5 kpc ; in this paper we have adopted a distance to ctb 1 of 3.1@xmath170.4 kpc as measured by @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ obsandreduction ] we describe the _ asca _ x - ray observations of hb21 and ctb 1 and the _ chandra _ observations of ctb 1 , including details of data reduction . _",
    "rosat _ and radio observations of these snrs are also described in this section . in section 3",
    "we present the results of our spectral analyses for both hb21 and ctb 1 ( in section 3.1 and section 3.2 , respectively ) . in section 4",
    "we discuss the nature of the hard discrete x - ray source 1wga j0001.4@xmath06229 : we have discovered weak evidence for pulsed x - ray emission from this source ( which is seen in projection against ctb 1 ) and consider the possibility that it is a neutron star associated with ctb 1 .",
    "we also present a search for radio pulsations from 1wga j0001.4@xmath06229 .",
    "interpretations of our x - ray results for hb21 and ctb 1 are presented in section 5 and section 6 , respectively .",
    "we also detected hard x - ray emission from ctb 1 : we discuss the nature of this emission in section [ ctb1hardsection ] .",
    "our preliminary results of this paper have been presented in @xcite after which we note that similiar data sets were analyzed and presented by @xcite .",
    "our primary results of hb21 are in agreement with and strengthen those of @xcite ; for ctb 1 , our paper presents extensive and thorough analysis of the _ chandra _ and _ asca _ data in smaller - scale regions .",
    "we also report important new results for this snr , including the probable detection of oxygen - rich ejecta from ctb 1 as well as spectral variations across the object .",
    "in addition , an x - ray hard point - like source is identified and an analysis of its x - ray and radio properties is presented .",
    "finally , the conclusions of this work are summarized in section 8 .",
    "because the x - ray emission from both hb21 and ctb 1 cover a large angular extent on the sky , two pointed observations were made of each snr with _",
    "@xcite , namely the southeast and northwest regions of hb21 and the southwest and northeast regions of ctb 1 ( see table [ ascaobstable ] for details of these observations ) .",
    "these observations provided almost a complete spatial coverage of the x - ray emitting gas in both snrs .",
    "the data reduction was conducted using the  xselect \" program ( version 2.2 ) , which is available from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) .",
    "there were two types of instruments onboard _ asca _  the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) and the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis )  and both of these instruments were composed of two units denoted as gis2 , gis3 , sis0 and sis1 , respectively .",
    "a single gis unit sampled a field of view @xmath25 in diameter and a background count rate of the gis is 5 @xmath4 10@xmath26 counts @xmath6 sec@xmath27 kev@xmath27 ; in comparison , a single sis unit sampled a field of view approximately @xmath28 in size .",
    "the nominal fwhm angular resolution of both the gis and sis units were approximately 1 arcminute .",
    "the standard rev2 screening criteria were applied when reducing both the raw gis and sis datasets .",
    "fmosaic \" from the ftools software package to generate an x - ray map by combining the gis2 and gis3 maps .",
    "we used the ftool  mkgisbgd \" to prepare blank - sky background spectra and images for each extracted gis source spectra : for these background datasets , point sources which are brighter than approximately 10@xmath29 ergs @xmath6 sec@xmath27 have been removed .",
    "similarly , background spectra were generated using standard sis blank - sky datasets for analyzing the extracted sis source spectra .",
    "the standard gis2 and gis3 response matrix files ( rmfs ) were used for analyzing extracted the gis source spectra while the ftool  sisrmg \" was used to prepare rmfs for the extracted sis source spectra .",
    "finally , the ftool  ascaarf \" was used to prepare ancillary response files ( arfs ) for each extracted gis and sis source spectra .",
    "we have also analyzed an archival dataset from an additional x - ray observation of ctb 1 made with _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "the corresponding obsid of this observation is 2810 ( pi : s. kulkarni ) and it was conducted as part of a search for central x - ray sources associated with galactic snrs .",
    "this observation was conducted in faint mode on 14 september 2002 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) at a focal plane temperature of @xmath14120@xmath30c such that the acis - i array of chips sampled a significant portion of the x - ray emitting plasma located interior to the radio shell of the snr .",
    "the acis - i array is composed of four front - illuminated ccd chips : each chip is 8@xmath313 @xmath4 8@xmath313 and the field of view of the entire array is approximately 17@xmath32 @xmath4 17@xmath32 .",
    "these chips are nominally sensitive to photons in the 0.2 through 10 kev energy range : the maximum effective collecting area for each chip is approximately 525 @xmath33 at 1.5 kev . the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) angular resolution of each chip at 1 kev is 1@xmath34 and finally the spectral resolution at 1 kev of each chip is 56 .",
    "these data were reduced using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) package ( version 3.1 ) with the calibration database ( caldb ) version 2.29 .",
    "standard processing was applied to this dataset : in particular , the task ",
    "acis@xmath35process@xmath35events \" was used to generate a new event file where corrections for charge transfer inefficiency and time - dependent gain were applied .",
    "the data were also filtered for bad pixels , background flare activity and events which had a grade value of 1 , 5 or 7 .",
    "finally , we applied the good time interval ( gti ) file supplied by the pipeline ( as well as the gti file prepared when filtering for background flares ) and the resulting total effective exposure time of the observation was 48.9 kiloseconds .",
    "discrete sources were identified with the _ ciao _ wavelet detection routine  wavdetect \" @xcite : in making a final image , these sources were excluded and the image was exposure - corrected and smoothed with the _ ciao _ task  csmooth .",
    "\" we extracted spectra from several regions of the diffuse x - ray emission seen in the _ chandra _ images using the _ ciao _ task  dmextract \" : results of the spectral analysis are presented in section [ ctb1subsection ] .",
    "when extracting spectra , we excluded point sources identified by  wavdetect \" to help reduce confusion with emission from background sources .",
    "we prepared arfs and rmfs using the ciao tools  mkwarf \" and  mkrmf , \" respectively ; background spectra were generated using a reprojected blank sky observation made with the acis - i array and available from the _ chandra _ x - ray center via the world wide web .",
    "we also included _",
    "position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observations of hb21 in our analysis : these observations were discussed already in some detail in the ph.d thesis of @xcite .",
    "they extend beyond the two fields observed by _",
    "asca _ and provide the complete spatial coverage of the snr .",
    "the pspc images are exposure and particle background corrected and merged together using the analysis techniques for extended objects developed by @xcite .",
    "the smoothing technique includes neighboring pixels within a circle of increasing radius until a selected number of counts is reached to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "lastly , we have augmented the x - ray datasets analyzed in this work with radio data provided by the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) @xcite . from this survey",
    "we have obtained radio images of hb21 and ctb 1 at the frequencies of 408 mhz and 1420 mhz .",
    "the angular resolution and sensitivity of the 408 mhz data are 3.@xmath324 @xmath4 3.@xmath324 csc @xmath36 and 0.75 sin @xmath36 k ( 3.0 mjy beam@xmath27 ) , respectively , while the angular resolution and sensitivity of the 1420 mhz data are 1 @xmath4 1 csc @xmath36 and 71 sin @xmath36 k ( 0.3 mjy beam@xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for more description about the cgps radio observations and the accompanying data reduction process .",
    "in figure [ hb21asca ] we present our broadband ( 0.7 - 10.0 kev ) exposure - corrected mosaicked _ asca _ gis image of hb21 : we have overlaid radio emission contours using cgps observations at a frequency of 408 mhz to show the extent of the snr radio shell . in figure [ hb21rosat ]",
    "we present a mosaicked _ rosat _ pspc image of hb21 ( with the same radio contours overlaid ) which depicts the entire extent of x - ray emission from the snr ( which extends beyond the two fields observed by _ asca _ ) .",
    "it is clear from inspection of these images that the x - ray emission is located in the interior of the well - defined snr radio shell : this combination of x - ray and radio morphologies exemplifies the defining characteristics of mixed - morphology snrs .",
    "the bulk of the interior x - ray emitting plasma is located just south of a prominent bend in the northern edge of the radio shell .",
    "we note that @xcite detected broad co emission lines from the location of this bend and @xcite presented near- and mid - infrared images of this same region which showed shock - cloud interaction features .",
    "both of these studies indicated that this is a site of an interaction between hb21 and a neighboring molecular cloud complex . in figure [ hb21softhard ]",
    "we present additional mosaicked _ asca _ gis images which depict soft and hard emission ( corresponding to the energy ranges of e@xmath371 kev and e@xmath381 kev , respectively ) from this snr .",
    "the gis2 count rates for e@xmath371 kev and e@xmath381 kev are 1.91(@xmath170.08)@xmath410@xmath39 cts s@xmath27 and 3.21(@xmath170.15)@xmath410@xmath39 cts s@xmath27 , respectively , while the respective count rates for e@xmath372 kev and e@xmath382 kev are 4.56(@xmath170.13)@xmath410@xmath39 cts s@xmath27 and 0.56(@xmath170.08)@xmath410@xmath39 cts s@xmath27 .",
    "significantly more x - ray emission is detected from hb21 at e@xmath372 kev x - ray energies than at e@xmath382 kev energies , illustrating the soft spectral nature typical of snrs .",
    "the gis2/gis3 spectra were extracted from elliptical regions approximately 23@xmath40 in size carefully selected to include most of the emission and avoid the edges of the field of view .",
    "likewise , the sis0/sis1 spectra were extracted from square - shaped regions approximately 10 arcminutes on a side and again the edges of the fields of view were avoided .",
    "the spectral extraction regions are marked in figure [ hb21asca ] .",
    "we analyzed the extracted spectra using the software package _",
    "xspec _ version 11.3.1 @xcite . for our spectral",
    "fitting we used two thermal models : the thermal model vapec , which describes an emission spectrum from a collisionally - ionized diffuse gas with variable elemental abundances @xcite and vnei , which is a non - equilibrium collisional plasma model which assumes a constant temperature and single ionization parameter @xcite .",
    "photoelectric absorption along the line of sight was accounted for with the phabs model ; finally , we allowed the abundances of silicon and sulfur to vary during the fitting process ( because lines associated with these particular elements are noticeable in the spectra ) while leaving the abundances of the other elements frozen to solar values .    in table",
    "[ hb21spectraltable ] we present results of our simultaneous fits to the gis2/gis3 and sis0/sis1 spectra for both the northwestern and southeastern regions of hb21 .",
    "we have obtained statistically acceptable fits ( with @xmath41@xmath42 values of @xmath3 1.04 - 1.06 ) to the extracted spectra using a single thermal component ( that is , either the vapec model or the vnei model ) for both the northwestern and southeastern regions .",
    "the column density and temperature are similar for both thermal models , namely @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 2 - 3@xmath410@xmath43 @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath3 0.66 - 0.68 kev . in figure [ hb21spectra ] , we present the extracted gis2 , gis3 , sis0 and sis1 spectra for the northwest region of hb21 : in each case , the fits obtained using ionization equilibrium ( cie ) and nonequilibrium ionization models are comparable in quality . in addition , the abundances of silicon and sulfur in our spectral fits exceed solar abundances : these _ asca _ observations are the first to reveal enhanced abundances of heavy elements in the x - ray spectra of hb21 ( as also noticed by @xcite )",
    ". our results are consistent with previous analyses of x - ray emission from hb21 @xcite where our present analysis of the broadband _ asca _ spectra has yielded similar temperatures to those derived from _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ observations .",
    "however , with the data from the _ asca _ observations we may establish more stringent constraints on the ionization timescale and the abundances of sulfur and silicon .",
    "the ionization timescales derived with the vnei model for the two regions are long ( @xmath44 = 5.9 ( @xmath383.2)@xmath410@xmath45 @xmath46 s and @xmath44 = 4.1@xmath47@xmath410@xmath45 @xmath46 s for the northwestern and southeastern regions of hb21 , respectively ) and within the error bounds for this parameter , cie is included ( @xmath44 @xmath21 10@xmath48 @xmath46 s  see @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason and because both the vapec and the vnei models return equally acceptable fits , we argue that the x - ray emitting plasma located within the interior of hb21 is close to ionization equilibrium .",
    "similar to the results presented by @xcite , we also observed slightly enhanced silicon and sulfur abundances in hb21 : based on our phabs@xmath4vapec ( phabs@xmath4vnei ) fits , our measured abundances are si=1.3@xmath49 ( 1.8@xmath170.05 ) and s=2.4@xmath171.0 ( 3.6@xmath50 ) for the northwestern region and si=1.4@xmath170.3 ( 2.0@xmath170.4 ) and s=1.7@xmath51 ( 3.0@xmath171.4 ) for the southeastern region ( see table [ hb21spectraltable ] ) .",
    "the slightly different abundances between the vapec and vnei fits may be due to either differences in the predicted line strengths between the non - equilibrium and equilibrium conditions or different sets of atomic data incorporated in these models .",
    "the respective lower limits for the abundances of si ( s ) for the northwestern region are 1.1 ( 1.3 ) and 1.4 ( 1.7 ) , while the lower limits for the southeastern region are 1.1 ( 1.6 ) and 0.9 ( 1.6 ) .",
    "the northwestern region shows modestly more consistent evidence of slightly enhanced silicon and sulfur abundances than the southeastern region .",
    "this suggests a contribution to the observed x - ray spectra from ejecta material .",
    "in figure [ hb21confcontours ] we present a plot of confidence contours for the silicon and sulfur abundances based on the phabs@xmath4vapec fit to the spectrum of the northwestern region .",
    "no significant spectral differences are seen between the northwestern and southeastern regions of this snr . in their analysis of spectra",
    "extracted from the _ asca _ observations of hb21 , @xcite found that fits obtained using the vnei model to the spectra extracted for both regions gave better fits at a statistically - significant level ( 4@xmath52 ) than fits obtained by a thermal plasma .",
    "in contrast , we find that fits obtained with vnei and fits obtained with a standard thermal plasma are comparable in quality . also , @xcite derived comparable ( though slightly larger ) values for @xmath1@xmath2 for both regions : those authors also found a similar trend where @xmath1@xmath2 is modestly elevated for the southeastern region compared to the northwestern region .",
    "we suspect that the minor differences between our results and those obtained by @xcite may be attributed to small differences in data reduction and spectral analysis techniques ( such as background subtraction ) .",
    "we also point out that @xcite commented that the derived column density values seemed to be rather high if hb21 is indeed only 0.8 kpc distant ( which was their assumed distance to the snr ) .",
    "they noted that an elevated column density ( at least for the eastern portion of the snr ) is comparable to the column density of the complex of molecular clouds seen toward hb21 as described by @xcite .",
    "we point out that if the larger distance to hb21 that we have assumed ( 1.7 kpc ) is adopted , the measured values for @xmath1@xmath2 seem more reasonable .",
    "lastly , to help determine more stringent constraints on the properties of the x - ray emitting plasma ( specifically the abundances of silicon and sulfur ) , we simultaneously fit the gis2 spectra extracted for the northwestern and southeastern portions of the snr with first the phabs@xmath4vapec model and then with the phabs@xmath4vnei model . for both models we obtained statistically acceptable fits ( with @xmath41@xmath53@xmath54 values of @xmath3 1.1 ) with values for @xmath55 and @xmath1@xmath2 that were consistent with those obtained for fits of the individual regions ( that is",
    ", @xmath55 @xmath3 0.6 kev and @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 0.2 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) . the abundances for both silicon and sulfur",
    "were indeed enhanced relative to solar : for the phabs@xmath4vapec ( phabs@xmath4vnei ) model , the abundances were 1.7@xmath170.4 ( 1.9@xmath56 ) for silicon and 3.5@xmath57 ( 4.3@xmath58 ) for sulfur .",

    "@xmath44 @xmath3 4(@xmath380.03)@xmath410@xmath59 @xmath46 s  is also consistent with ionization equilibrium.we summarize the results for these fits in table [ hb21spectraltable ] .",
    "a broadband ( 0.710.0 kev ) exposure - corrected and mosaicked _ asca _ gis image of ctb 1 is presented in both figures [ ctb1asca ] and [ ctb1asca2 ] with radio contours from the cgps overlaid .",
    "both hb21 and ctb 1 show the typical center - filled x - ray morphology combined with a shell - like radio morphology that characterizes mm snrs : in the case of ctb 1 , however , as noted previously the x - ray emission is seen to extend through a gap along the northeastern portion of the radio shell .",
    "figure [ ctb1softhard ] shows mosaicked images of the soft and hard x - ray emission ( again corresponding to the energy ranges e@xmath371 kev and e@xmath381 kev , respectively ) ; there is a noticeable difference in the spatial structure between the soft and the hard emission . in figure [ ctb1optical ]",
    "we present an optical h@xmath18 image of ctb 1 ( courtesy of robert fesen ) with the contours of the x - ray emission overlaid : the optical morphology of ctb 1 is quite similar to the radio morphology with the same shell - like structure and a prominent gap in the northeast @xcite .",
    "little h@xmath18 emission is seen in the interior of ctb 1 , nor is any optical emission seen where the x - ray emission extends through the gap in the optical and radio shell in the northeast .",
    "the observed slight extension of x - ray emission in the west through the optical and radio shell is likely either residuals due to the broad _ asca _ point - spread - function or point sources rather than true emission from the snr .",
    "hard image reveals a point - like source seen in projection against the diffuse emission of ctb 1 : it is located at ra ( j2000.0 ) 00@xmath60 01@xmath61 25.@xmath625 , dec ( j2000.0 ) @xmath062@xmath30 29@xmath40 40@xmath63 and it lies very close to the eastern edge of the optical and radio shell .",
    "this source ( denoted as 1wga j0001.4@xmath06229 ) may be a neutron star possibly associated with ctb 1 ; we discuss it in detail in the next section .",
    "in contrast to hb21 , a significant amount of emission from ctb 1 is seen at energies above 1 kev .",
    "similar to our spectral analysis performed with hb21 , we extracted gis2 and gis3 spectra from elliptical regions approximately 23@xmath40 in size from both the southwestern and northeastern portions of the x - ray emitting plasma . when extracting gis2 and gis3 spectra from the northeastern region , we excluded a region 4 arcminutes in diameter centered on the position of the discrete x - ray source 1wga j00001.4@xmath06229 to avoid spectral contamination by this source .",
    "we also extracted sis0 and sis1 spectra from both the southwestern and northeastern portions of the snr , again using square - shaped regions approximately 10 arcminutes on a side .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio of the extracted sis0 and sis1 spectra for the northeastern region was not sufficient for spectral analysis and we therefore omitted these spectra from our analysis .",
    "we attempted to fit the extracted _ asca _ spectra using the thermal models vapec and vnei along with the model phabs for the photoelectric absorption .",
    "in contrast to hb21 , our fits with either vapec or vnei _ did not _",
    "produce a @xmath41@xmath42 lower than 1.3 for either region and failed to account for the hard x - ray emission seen above @xmath33 kev from both regions .",
    "a two - component model with a soft thermal component with a temperature of 0.3 - 0.4 kev ( either vapec or vnei ) and a second thermal component with a higher temperature or a power law component was required for an acceptable fit to the extracted spectra from both the southwest and northeast portions of the snr ( see table [ ctb1ascafit ] ) .",
    "thus , a hard excess is present in the _ asca _ spectra of ctb 1 : @xcite also identified a second thermal component of x - ray emission from this snr based on analysis of extracted _ asca _ spectra but only for the southwestern region .",

    "an example of another mm snr which features such enhanced abundances is w44 @xcite : other similar sources are identified by @xcite ( including hb21 , which was analyzed both in their study and in the study presented here . ) in addition , two other galactic snrs  the cygnus loop @xcite and g347.7@xmath00.2 @xcite  feature enhanced abundances of metals as well .",
    "w49b @xcite shows highly enhanced abundances but its age is estimated to be 2000 years @xcite and @xcite describe the source as an atypical mm snr .",
    "because mm snrs like ctb 1 are commonly believed to be evolved sources ",
    "age estimates of ctb 1 range from 9000 yr @xcite to 4.4@xmath410@xmath86 yr @xcite  their x - ray spectra are dominated by swept - up material @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of x - ray - emitting material associated with these sources with enhanced metal abundances is unexpected .",
    "the detection of o - rich ejecta associated with ctb 1 is particularly noteworthy : ctb 1 may belong to a previously unrecognized class of mm snrs whose x - ray emission is dominated by o - rich ejecta located within their interiors . as noted previously , another possible member of this particular class of mm snrs with o - rich ejecta may be hb3 @xcite .",
    "we note that o - rich ejecta has been previously detected in the evolved ( 1.4 @xmath410@xmath86 yr old ) smc snr b0049 - 73.6 by @xcite and it is likely that centrally - located ejecta will be found in a number of relatively old galactic snrs .",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma associated with ctb 1 clearly extends through the gap in the crescent - shaped radio shell : @xcite and @xcite first noticed this remarkable extension of x - ray emission based on _ rosat _ pspc observations .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed to explain the morphology of the observed x - ray emission : @xcite has suggested that the ambient ism toward the northeastern portion of the snr was cleared by a supernova event which took place prior to the birth of ctb 1 , and thus a breakout occurred as the snr expanded into this region of a dramatically lower density .",
    "a competing theory for the morphology has been proposed by @xcite , who suggested that the x - ray emission from ctb 1 lies in the interior of a bubble seen in the 21 cm h line , presumably blown by winds of the ctb 1 stellar progenitor .",
    "our x - ray images show that the diffuse x - ray emission in the northeast clearly extends through the relatively narrow break in the optical and radio shell , with the breakout directed into the interior of the bubble seen in the neutral hydrogen line .",
    "such a morphology favors a scenario where a supernova explosion occurred within the hi shell , followed by subsequent breakout into the bubble and not an explosion within the bubble itself .",
    "our _ asca _ spectra show little difference between the x - ray properties of the southwest and northeast regions : hints of variations in temperature and abundances exist but better x - ray data are needed to determine whether they are real and not just statistical fluctuations .",
    "the _ asca _ spectra of the southwestern portion of ctb 1 revealed the presence of a hard component in addition to the soft ( @xmath55 @xmath3 0.28 kev ) component .",
    "this hard component may be modeled as a second thermal component with a temperature of @xmath7 @xmath3 3 kev or as a power - law continuum with a photon index @xmath11 @xmath3 2 - 3 .",
    "hard x - ray emission was also detected by _",
    "asca _ in the northeast region of ctb 1 : a power - law component with a photon index @xmath11 @xmath3 1.4 ( a somewhat lower value compared to the southwest region ) combined with a soft thermal component ( again with a temperature @xmath7 @xmath3 0.28 kev ) yields a statisically acceptable fit .",
    "observation of the southwest region of ctb 1 revealed regions of harder emission patches on the scale of an arcminute in size : the spectrum of one of these regions can be modeled by either a single thermal component with an elevated temperature ( @xmath7 @xmath3 0.66 kev ) or as the combination of a soft thermal component ( @xmath7 @xmath3 0.28 kev ) and a power law component with a photon index @xmath11 @xmath3 2.0 ( see tables [ ctb1chandrafit ] and [ ctb1ascafit ] ) .",
    "the  hard \" region observed by _",
    "is only a few arcminutes from the center of ctb 1 and well inside the radio - emitting shell of the snr : it is diffuse in nature although the number of counts detected from the source is limited .",
    "it is possible that the hard x - ray emission detected by _ asca _ from ctb 1 may be composed of localized hard regions such as this one : unfortunately we do not have enough counts in this  hard \" region to distinguish between thermal and non - thermal origins .",
    "we note that two other mm snrs , w28 and ic 443 , contain high - temperature thermal plasmas in their interiors @xcite .",
    "several possible explanations may be considered for the origin of hard x - ray emission from mm snrs : first , the hard emission may be caused by temperature variations within the snr . in the case of ctb 1 , this scenario is supported by a good fit to the spectrum of the  hard \" region with a thermal component with a much higher than average temperature .",
    "supernova ejecta may be inhomogeneous , in which case a multi - temperature plasma with spatially - varying abundances is expected .",
    "alternatively , the  hard \" regions may be caused by localized nonthermal emission : such emission has already been detected in ic 443 @xcite and @xmath20 cygni @xcite .",
    "additional observations are needed to understand the true nature of the hard x - ray emission from ctb 1 .",
    "\\1 . we presented _ asca _ observations of the mm snr hb21 .",
    "our _ asca _ images of this snr are similar to _ rosat _ images and reveal a diffuse centrally filled x - ray emission located within a radio shell . from x - ray spectra , we measure a column density toward this source and a temperature for the x - ray emitting plasma of @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 0.3@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath3 0.7 kev , respectively : no significant spatial differences in temperature are found . silicon and sulfur abundances are slightly enhanced relative to solar , particularly for the northwestern region , and no hard component to the x - ray emission was detected .",
    "the properties of hb21 are similar to those seen in several other mm snrs , such as the presence of isothermal plasma .",
    "this result supports the interpretation that mm snrs are evolved sources currently in the radiative phase of evolution : the x - ray properties of hb21 exemplify the primary characteristics of mm snrs as defined by @xcite .",
    "we presented _ asca _ and _ chandra _ observations of the mm snr ctb 1 .",
    "_ asca _ observations reveal center - filled x - ray emission located within the radio shell : the x - ray emission extends outside the circular shell through the breakout gap in the northeast . while the global x - ray and radio morphology is similar to hb21 , the x - ray spectra of ctb 1 and hb21 are very different .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of ctb 1 shows several prominent lines such as o ly@xmath18 ( 0.65 kev ) and ne ix ( 0.9 kev ) .",
    "we find that ctb 1 is likely an oxygen - rich snr with enhanced abundances of oxygen and neon : this is surprising for an evolved snr such as ctb 1 .",
    "the derived abundances are consistent with an explosion of a stellar progenitor with a mass of 13 - 15 m@xmath117 and possibly even higher .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "spectra of the southwest region of ctb 1 can not be fit with a single thermal component and instead require the presence of an additional component to account for an excess emission seen at higher energies .",
    "based on _ asca _ and _ chandra _ spectra of ctb 1 , we derive a column density @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 0.6@xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 and the soft component temperature @xmath7@xmath9@xmath3 0.28 kev ; the hard emission may be modeled either by a thermal component with a temperature @xmath7@xmath10 @xmath3 3 kev or by a power law component with a photon index of @xmath11 @xmath3 2 - 3 .",
    "likewise , the _ asca _ spectra of the northeast region of ctb 1 also show an excess at higher energies : these spectra are fit best by a power law with a photon index @xmath11 = 1.4 plus the soft thermal component .",
    "observation of the southwestern region reveals localized regions of hard emission : one such region is @xmath8 in size .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this region may be fit with either a higher temperature thermal component ( @xmath7 = 0.66 kev ) or with the combination of a softer thermal component ( @xmath7 = 0.28 kev ) and a power law component ( @xmath11 @xmath3 2.0 ) . because of the poor photon statistics , its true nature is unclear .",
    "possible scenarios for its origin include temperature variations within the x - ray emitting plasma of ctb 1 , including the ejecta , or localized non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "4 . the _ asca _",
    "hard ( @xmath129 kev ) image of ctb 1 reveals a point - like source seen in projection against the diffuse emission of ctb 1 .",
    "this source  denoted as 1wga j0001.4@xmath06229 and located at ra ( j2000.0 ) 00@xmath60 01@xmath61 25.@xmath625 , dec ( j2000.0 ) @xmath062@xmath30 29@xmath40 40@xmath63  may be a neutron star associated with ctb 1 .",
    "the gis2/gis3 spectra of this source are well - fit by a power - law continuum with a photon index @xmath11=2.2@xmath12 ( typical for rotation - powered pulsars ) and the measured column density is comparable to the column density measured for ctb 1 .",
    "there is marginal evidence for pulsations in x - ray data at 47.6 msec , but no pulsations have been detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "we thank the referee for many useful comments which helped improve the overall quality of the manuscript .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with steven reynolds regarding the nature of the hard x - ray emission seen toward ctb 1 .",
