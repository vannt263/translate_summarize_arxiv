    "the x - ray activity of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is usually attributed to accretion discs surrounding putative black holes .",
    "a special feature of accreting black holes is that their radiation spectra extend up to the @xmath2-ray band .",
    "the @xmath2-rays are thought to be produced in the innermost region of the accretion disc ( see , e.g. , svensson 1996 for a review ) .",
    "it may be a cold disc covered by an active corona in which particles are accelerated in magnetic reconnection events ( galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ) .",
    "it may also be a hot two - temperature disc as proposed by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) .",
    "as soon as the radiation spectrum extends above the electron rest - mass energy , @xmath5 kev , the reaction @xmath6 becomes inevitable and leads to production of an electron - positron atmosphere of the black hole ( herterich 1974 ) .",
    "guilbert , fabian & rees ( 1983 ) showed that if the @xmath2-ray luminosity exceeds @xmath7 of the eddington limit for the black hole , the @xmath0 atmosphere becomes optically thick to thomson scattering .",
    "the brightest accretion discs thus can be surrounded by optically thick @xmath0 envelopes .",
    "the dynamics of an @xmath0 envelope around a compact @xmath2-ray source has been discussed in various contexts ( e.g. , katz 1982 ; zdziarski 1984 ; guilbert & stepney 1985 ; coppi & lamb 1992 ; illarionov & krolik 1996 ; li & liang 1996 ) , and it has been shown that the pairs should share the momentum of radiation and form an outflow from the source .    in this paper , we study the formation of vertical @xmath0 outflows from disc - like @xmath2-ray sources . following the observed spectra of non - blazar agns and gbhs",
    ", we assume that the @xmath2-rays contribute only a small fraction , @xmath8 , to the bolometric luminosity , and the bulk of disc emission is in uv or x - ray bands .",
    "the created pairs then move in the dense soft radiation field which forces them to acquire an equilibrium velocity @xmath9 such that the effective radiation pressure acting on the pairs vanishes ( gurevich & rumyantsev 1965 ) . the equilibrium velocity is determined by the angular distribution of the radiation and can easily be calculated for an optically thin atmosphere . in the optically thick case ,",
    "the problem becomes non - linear as scattering by moving pairs affects the angular distribution of the radiation above the disc .",
    "the corresponding transfer problem can be solved self - consistently to yield both the plasma velocity and radiation intensity as a function of optical depth in the @xmath0 atmosphere ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the density of the outflow is governed by pair injection due to @xmath1 interactions .",
    "we assume that the primary spectrum of @xmath2-rays emerging from the source has a break at a few mev due to strong absorption of more energetic photons inside the source .",
    "the bulk of @xmath10 interactions outside the disc occur between mev photons , just above the threshold .",
    "the @xmath2-ray transfer is therefore non - linear as the @xmath10 opacity at each height is determined by the mev radiation field itself . to study the non - linear transformation of @xmath2-rays into an @xmath0 outflow",
    ", we have developed a code which calculates the hard x/@xmath2-ray transfer in a slab geometry .",
    "besides the @xmath10 reaction , the code approximately accounts for compton scattering and annihilation emission of the created pairs , assuming that the pairs move with the typical velocity @xmath11 .    the main properties of the atmosphere , such as thomson optical depth and the power of @xmath0 outflow , are determined basically by one parameter of the source  the compactness parameter defined in section 2.1 .",
    "the results are weakly dependent on the specific internal boundary conditions for the transfer problem . in our calculations ,",
    "the primary source is simulated in the simplest way : a homogeneous disc emitting hard photons isotropically with a power - law spectrum around 511 kev .    in section 2 , we discuss a general constraint imposed by @xmath10 absorption on the spectrum of an accretion disc .",
    "then , in section 3 , we calculate the rate of pair injection above the disk surface and discuss the formation of an optically thin @xmath0 outflow . in section 4 , we consider @xmath2-ray sources with large compactness parameters , which are surrounded by optically thick @xmath0 atmospheres , and calculate the @xmath0 density and velocity profiles of the optically thick outflows .",
    "we also discuss pair acceleration at large distances from the source .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "@xmath10 absorption imposes a restriction on the maximum energy of the @xmath2-rays emitted by a compact source ( guilbert et al .",
    "this provides a test for whether the observed @xmath2-rays can be emitted by an accretion disc or if they should be associated with a relativistic jet or a more complicated geometry of the source ( illarionov & krolik 1996 ) .",
    "such a test has been applied to @xmath2-loud agns ( e.g. , mcnaron - brown et al . 1995 ; becker & kafatos 1995 ) .      consider a homogeneous @xmath2-ray emitting disc of radius @xmath12 and assume that the hard x/@xmath2-ray emission emerging from the disc is isotropic and has a power - law spectrum around 511 kev with intensity ( flux per unit energy per steradian ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is photon energy in units of the electron rest mass energy .",
    "the disc spectral luminosity is given by @xmath15 the main parameter of the model is the compactness parameter , @xmath16 which can also be expressed in terms of the eddington luminosity , @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gravitational radius of a black hole of mass @xmath20 .",
    "we assume the typical spectral index @xmath21 , then the @xmath2-ray intensity steeply falls off towards high energies and @xmath22 roughly corresponds to the total luminosity above 511 kev .",
    "this luminosity is a few per cent of the bolometric luminosity of the disc in uv and x - rays .      for a rough estimate of @xmath10 absorption inside the source ,",
    "take the @xmath10 opacity of an isotropic radiation field ( gould & schrder 1967 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spectral energy density of the radiation , and @xmath25 is a numerical factor , e.g. , @xmath26 0.122 , 0.072 , 0.047 for @xmath4=1 , 1.5 , 2 respectively .",
    "the position of the spectral break due to absorption inside the source , @xmath27 , can be estimated from the condition @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the disc thickness .",
    "then one gets @xmath30 in the case @xmath31 this is a much weaker constraint than that for a spherical source with @xmath32 .",
    "however , equation ( 4 ) is not the final answer to the problem of @xmath10 absorption because those @xmath2-rays which have not been absorbed inside the disc - like source may be absorbed above the disc when passing through its radiation field ( see also zdziarski 1984 ) .",
    "let us evaluate absorption for a @xmath2-photon of energy @xmath33 emitted along the disc axis ( @xmath34-axis ) assuming for simplicity that the disc compactness is small ( @xmath35 ) and the non - linear effects are unimportant .",
    "then at height @xmath34 the @xmath10 opacity seen by our photon is caused by the radiation propagating freely from the disc within an angle @xmath36 .",
    "photons of energy @xmath37 streaming at angle @xmath38 can interact with our photon if @xmath37 exceeds the threshold @xmath39 the @xmath10 opacity is then given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the cross section for @xmath1 pair production ( jauch & rohrlich 1976 ) @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 is the energy of the interacting photons in the center - of - momentum frame .",
    "after integration we find @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the numerical factor already appearing in equation ( 3 ) and calculated analytically in svensson ( 1987 ) .",
    "since the integral peaks at @xmath46 , the exact value of @xmath27 is not important and we set @xmath47 .",
    "now from equations ( 3 ) and ( 8) we get @xmath48    = 8.4 cm = 8.2 cm    this function is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath491 , 1.5 , 2 .",
    "the opacity above the disc is strongly reduced because our photon moving along the disc axis does not encounter any radiation in the opposite direction which would dominate the @xmath10 opacity in the isotropic case .",
    "it is interesting to compare the total optical depth seen by a @xmath2-photon emitted along the disc axis , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 which can be ( very roughly ) associated with the @xmath1 optical depth of a spherical source of the same intensity , @xmath52 , and dimension , @xmath12 .",
    "we get @xmath53 the dependence of this ratio on @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . e.g. , for @xmath54 , @xmath55 is @xmath56 30 times smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "this result combined with equation ( 4 ) shows that the absorption constraint on @xmath2-ray spectra is very sensitive to the source geometry and it can be much weaker than the usually used estimate for the spherical case .",
    "= 8.4 cm = 8.2 cm      we now calculate the non - linear @xmath2-ray transfer above the disc and study the dependence of the observed absorption break on the disc inclination to the line of sight .",
    "the bulk of @xmath10 reactions occur close to the disc surface ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and we solve a simplified transfer problem in a one - dimensional approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the radiation field is taken to be axisymmetric and uniform on any slice @xmath57 , and the effect of the finite size of the disc is treated for an optically thin atmosphere by truncating the radiation at angles @xmath58 .",
    "we divide the slab @xmath59 above the disc into 25 horizontal layers , and assume that the radiation escapes freely from the last ( upper ) layer .",
    "the intrinsic boundary condition is the isotropic power - law radiation given by equation ( 1 ) . to get a stationary solution , @xmath60 , we take an initially empty atmosphere and let the @xmath2-rays propagate from the disc .",
    "we then follow the evolution of the radiation field in the computational slab until a stationary state is established .",
    "further details of the numerical method are given in appendix a.    examples of spectra emerging at different angles from the disc with a modest compactness @xmath61 and spectral index @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "we included only the @xmath10 reaction in the transfer problem in order to see the efficiency of pure absorption .",

    "a qualitative dependence on the inclination angle @xmath64 is seen in fig .",
    "3 : absorption is more efficient at large inclinations . at large @xmath64 , an emitted @xmath2-photon travels a long path at small heights where the @xmath1 opacity is large .",

    "= 8.4 cm = 8.2 cm",
    "each @xmath10 interaction produces one @xmath0 pair .",

    "pairs are also accelerated by the pressure of soft radiation .",
    "the @xmath0 plasma is light and the gravitational force can be neglected as compared to the radiative force when @xmath72 .",
    "then pairs acquire an equilibrium bulk velocity for which the radiation pressure is balanced by the radiation drag . near the disc surface , where the radiation field is semi - isotropic",
    ", the equilibrium velocity is about @xmath73 ( icke 1989 ; see also section 4.2 ) .      in an optically thin wind ,",
    "pairs escape before they can annihilate since @xmath74 is less than the time - scale for annihilation , @xmath75 .",
    "then the flux of escaping pairs equals the column rate of pair production above the disc .",

    "the evolution of the pair density with height is then governed mainly by annihilation .",
    "the steep decrease in @xmath136 shows that the rate of pair injection , @xmath139 , steeply decreases with height as a result of strong degradation of the @xmath2-rays - rays at large @xmath64 .",
