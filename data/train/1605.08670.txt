    "in the spirit of minkowski geometry ( see @xcite ) , our considerations refer to _ normed _ ( or _ minkowski _ ) _ planes _ , i.e. , to two - dimensional real banach spaces , whose _ unit ball _",
    "@xmath0 is a two - dimensional compact , convex set centered at the origin @xmath1 of a cartesian coordinate system ( which itself presents the euclidean background metric ) .",

    "we write capital letters like @xmath3 for _ points _ with respective _ position vectors _ @xmath4 ; by @xmath5 we denote _ lines _ , in the latter case spanned by @xmath6 and @xmath0 , and by @xmath7 the _ segment _ with endpoints @xmath6 and @xmath0 is meant .",
    "we use @xmath8 for the _ vector _ from @xmath6 to @xmath0 , or for the _ half - line _ starting at @xmath6 and passing through @xmath0 ; sometimes we use also @xmath9 for half - lines ( the respective meaning will be clear by the context ) . further on , we write @xmath10 for the _ general minkowskian _ and the _ euclidean norm _ of @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath12 stands for the _ minkowskian unit vector _",

    "we use i d and int , respectively . referring to the minkowskian arc - length @xmath15",
    ", we denote by @xmath16 the _ radial function _ of the minkowskian unit circle , and by @xmath17 a _ planar curve _ , both parametrized by @xmath15 ; @xmath18 is the _ busemann curvature function _ of @xmath17 .",
    "the _ busemann sigma function _ of the @xmath19-dimensional affine subspace @xmath20 is @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denotes the _ angle _ determined by the lines @xmath23 .",
    "finally , we say that a vector @xmath24 is _ birkhoff orthogonal _ to a vector @xmath25 if @xmath26 for every @xmath27 .",
    "the first part of the following subsection contains also some history of the subject studied here .",
    "the question how to measure angles is old and interesting . inspired by hilbert s axiomatic approach to geometry ( see @xcite ) , many authors delt with this problem in a large variety of interesting situations .",
    "e.g. , for continuously differentiable curves satisfying a general extremal property this was discussed by bliss @xcite .",
    "he defined his concept as follows : if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two extremal rays through the point @xmath1 , and @xmath30 is the arc of length @xmath31 of a transversal ( which is an arc of a generalized circle passing through @xmath6 and @xmath32 , with center @xmath1 ) at the generalized distance @xmath19 from @xmath1 , then the _ generalized angle _ between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is defined to be the limit of the ratio @xmath33 as @xmath19 approaches zero .",
    "his analytical formulas reflect the usual computation methods in classical euclidean and non - euclidean geometries , and even on surfaces embedded into the euclidean 3-space .",
    "busemann @xcite investigated the geometry of finsler spaces , and there he observed the following facts : _ the volume problem makes it more than probable that an analogous situation exists for finsler spaces .",
    "therefore the study of minkowskian geometry ought to be the first and main step , the passage from there to general finsler spaces will be the second and simpler step . what has been done in minkowskian geometry , what are the difficulties and problems , and which tools will be necessary ?",
    "little has been done , but the field is quite accessible .",
    "the main difficulty comes from our long euclidean tradition , which makes it hard ( at least for the author ) to get a feeling for the subject and to conjecture the right theorems .",
    "the type of problem which faces us is clear : a minkowskian geometry admits in general only the translations as motions and not the rotations .",
    "since the group of motions is smaller , we expect more invariants . by passing from euclidean to projective geometry ,",
    "ellipses , parabolas , and hyperbolas become indiscernible .",
    "the present case presents ` the much more difficult converse problem , to discern objects which have always been considered as identical ` . _ to illustrate this , busemann noted that , contrarily to the euclidean case , the general minkowskian sphere defined by the set of points with the given minkowskian distance @xmath19 from the origin @xmath1 holds the first property , but does not hold the third and fourth property of the list given here :    * it maximizes the volume among all sets of diameter @xmath34 . *",
    "it is envelope of planes normal to the rays with origin @xmath19 . *",
    "it solves the isoperimetric problem . *",
    "it leads to the area @xmath35 of a convex or sufficiently smooth non - convex simple closed surface @xmath36 bounding a set @xmath37 via the relation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the outer parallel domain of the body @xmath37 of radius @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of the third property is another set , the so - called _ isoperimetrix _ with respect to the sphere @xmath0 . in the planar situation",
    "it is obtained by rotating the euclidean _ polar _ of @xmath0 by @xmath40 , and thus it is also a convex body centered at the origin .",
    "the isoperimetrix can also be defined in an intrinsic way , using the concept of _ antinorm _ ( see @xcite )",
    ". this definition can be extended in a natural way for every even dimensional space ( see @xcite ) , and this convex body solves the fourth property if we take its enlarged copies to determine the parallel domain . the second property can be divided into two properties ; the sphere @xmath0 has one of them , and the solution of the isoperimetric problem has the other one .    in @xcite , busemann discussed the `` axiom '' for angle measures in the case of plane curves belonging to a class @xmath41 of open jordan curves , holding the additional property that any two distinct points lie on exactly one curve of @xmath41 .",
    "he defined the concepts of _ ray _",
    "@xmath19 , _ angle _ @xmath42 with _ legs _ @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and _ angle measure",
    "_ @xmath45 on the set of angles having the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath46 ( positivity ) , 2 .   @xmath47 if and only if @xmath42 is straight , 3 .   if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two angles with a common leg but with no other common ray , then @xmath50 ( additivity ) , 4 .   if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 ( continuity ) .",
    "he showed that these assumptions are sufficient to obtain many of the usual relationships between angle measure and curvature .",
    "we note that busemann collected the essential properties of an angle measure that we have to require in every structure , where a natural concept of angle exists .",
    "lippmann @xcite considered the classical minkowski space defined on the @xmath53-dimensional euclidean space by a `` metrische grundfunction '' @xmath54 , which is a positive , convex functional on the space being homogeneous of first degree . in our terminology , @xmath54 is the _ norm - square function_. to have convexity ( following minkowski s definition ) , lippmann required continuity of the second partial derivative , and positivity of the second derivative of @xmath54 .",
    "hence the unit ball of the corresponding space is always smooth .",
    "he used the arcus cosine of the bivariate function @xmath55 to measure the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this yields a concept of transversality , namely : @xmath24 is _ transversal _ to @xmath25 if @xmath56 . a wide variety of angle measures referring to metric properties can be found in the literature .",
    "e.g. , lippmann s papers @xcite contain typically metric definitions of angle measures .",
    "for the situation in ( normed or ) minkowski planes see , in addition to the papers already mentioned , graham , witsenhausen and zassenhaus @xcite .",
    "this paper refers to a useful metrical classification of angles by their measures , and a good review on this topic can be found in the book of thompson @xcite .    in the last few decades some authors rediscovered this interesting problem in connection with the problem of orthogonality .",
    "we have to mention p. brass who in @xcite redefined the concept of angle measure as follows .    [ brassmeasure ] by an _ angle measure _ we mean a measure @xmath57 on the unit circle @xmath2 with center @xmath1 which is extended in the usual translation - invariant way to measure angles elsewhere , and which has the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath58 , 2 .   for any borel set @xmath59 we have @xmath60 , and 3 .",
    "for each @xmath61 we have @xmath62 .",
    "this concept was used in the papers of dvelmeyer @xcite , martini and swanepoel @xcite , and fankhnel @xcite .",
    "another direction of research is to give immediate metric definitions of the angle of two vectors . in this direction",
    "we can find also papers of p. m. milii @xcite , c. r. diminnie , e. z. andalafte , r. w. freese @xcite or h. gunawan , j. lindiarni and o. neswan @xcite .",
    "further related papers on angle measures are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as busemann observed , the problem to find a natural definition of angular measure arises from the fact that the group of minkowski rotations is very small . in a general normed space there are no such rotations which are also isometries of the space . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath63 is a _ minkowski plane _ that is non - euclidean , then the group @xmath64 of isometries of @xmath63 is isomorphic to the semi - direct product of the translation group @xmath65 of @xmath66 with a finite group of even order that is either a cyclic group of rotations or a dihedral group ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are so - called left reflections ( right - reflections ) based on the notion of birkhoff orthogonality ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these are not isometries , but they have some important properties of isometries ; e.g. , they are affine mappings of the plane sending lines into lines ; the product of three left reflections in parallel lines in a strictly convex minkowski plane is a left reflection in another line belonging to the same pencil of parallel lines ; and the product of two left reflections in birkhoff orthogonal lines is a symmetry of the plane .",
    "unfortunately , if in a strictly convex and smooth minkowski plane for left reflections the main lemma on three reflections with concurrent axes holds , then the plane is already euclidean . hence there is no chance to define an angle measure and also rotations by left reflections in the way that `` a rotation is the product of two left reflections in non - parallel lines '' .",
    "this motivates our definition of minkowski rotations .      in order to define a concept of rotation for a minkowski plane , we start with extending the definition of brass by considering borel measures in a larger class of curves , not only in the unit circle , and we will derive angle measures for normed planes from it .",
    "[ genmeasure]let @xmath67 be a closed jordan curve which is starlike with respect to a point @xmath68 of the interior of the region bounded by @xmath69 .",
    "an _ angle measure with respect to such a jordan curve _ is a ( normalized ) borel measure @xmath70 on @xmath69 for which the following properties hold : + * ( a ) * @xmath71 ;    * ( b ) * for any @xmath72 we have @xmath73 ; and    * ( c ) * any non - degenerate arc of @xmath69 has positive measure .",
    "+ an angle measure defined in this way provides a translation invariant measure of _ angles _ in the plane , which we define to be the convex hulls of two rays with the same starting point , or the half - plane given by two opposite rays .",
    "given an angle @xmath74 with apex @xmath75 , we define its _ generalized angle measure _",
    "@xmath76 to be the measure @xmath70 of the arc determined on @xmath69 by the image of @xmath74 via the translation @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ figgenang ] illustrates this concept .     and @xmath68 ]    using this notion of generalized angle measure",

    "let @xmath80 be a generalized angle measure as in the previous definition .",
    "a _ general rotation _ ( with respect to @xmath80 ) is a transform @xmath81 for which the following three properties hold : + * ( a ) * the transform @xmath82 leaves invariant the pencil @xmath83 of rays with origin in @xmath68 . in other words ,",

    "intuitively , @xmath82  rotates every ray of @xmath83 by a same angle \" .",
    "notice that a general rotation can be considered as acting in the space of directions of @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , the set @xmath83 can be seen as this space .",
    "later this viewpoint will be useful .",
    "we emphasize that any general rotation relies on a fixed closed jordan curve @xmath69 , an inner point @xmath68 with respect to which @xmath69 is starlike , and a generalized angle measure @xmath80 .",
    "on the other hand , these three informations yield a certain class of general rotations , which we denote by @xmath91 .",
    "we head now to describe an element of such a class in terms of the angle of rotation . for any",
    "@xmath92 we set @xmath93 as follows : if @xmath94 , then @xmath95 is mapped to the ( unique ) point @xmath96 taken counterclockwise , say , for which the rays @xmath97 and @xmath98 are such that @xmath99 .",
    "now , any point @xmath100 can be written in the form @xmath101 for some @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the _ radial function _ which associates each ray starting at @xmath68 to its intersection with @xmath69 .",
    "we just set @xmath104    it is clear that @xmath105 .",
    "this description indicates that a class @xmath91 has a group structure under composition , as in the standard euclidean case .",
    "this is summarized in the following lemma .    for a class @xmath91",
    "we have the following properties :    * ( a ) * _ regarding composition _ , _ @xmath91 is an abelian group .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the sum modulo @xmath108 . _    * ( b ) * _ for any @xmath109 , the application @xmath110 is a bijection from @xmath111 to @xmath69 .",
    "_    this is an immediate consequence of the additivity of a measure and of item * ( c ) * from definition [ genmeasure ] .",
    "we highlight an interesting fact : the standard euclidean rotation group can be obtained in any minkowski plane .",
    "we just have to consider the group @xmath112 where @xmath69 is the _ lwner ellipse _ , which is defined as the ellipse of maximal volume contained in @xmath0 , and @xmath57 is the measure given by twice the area of its sectors .",
    "a proof of the existence of the lwner ellipse can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ next we give two examples of general rotations in the euclidean plane .",
    "the first one relies on an area - based measure for an ellipse , which is clearly well defined . in the second we use the arc - length measure referring to a nephroid .",
    "consider the euclidean plane and the system of ellipses with common focus at the origin @xmath1 and with major axis on the @xmath24-axis of the coordinate system , such that the positive half - line of @xmath24 contains the closest point of the ellipse ( see fig .",
    "[ heliofig ] ) . in that polar",
    "coordinate system ( which is called the heliocentric coordinate system for the ellipse ) , for which the ray @xmath113 is the positive half axis @xmath24 ,",
    "we can write the radial function @xmath114 of the ellipse @xmath115 by the formula @xmath116 where @xmath68 is the semi - latus rectum of the ellipse and @xmath117 is the eccentricity of it , respectively . let @xmath118 be the area of the sector enclosed by @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath115 be the arc between these lines .",
    "hence @xmath121 with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath115 from above , for every real number @xmath122 there is a generalized rotation of the euclidean plane about @xmath1 with this angle @xmath123 . by kepler s second law about planetary motions , the angle @xmath123 of a generalized rotation is proportional to the time of the motion of the planet .",
    "hence the generalized rotation with angle @xmath123 maps the current position @xmath124 of the planet to that point @xmath125 of the orbit where the planet arrives after time @xmath123 .    the principle of measuring the angle proportional to the area of the sector intersected by the angle domain from the basic disk @xmath126 works in all minkowski planes and for all basic curves @xmath115 .",
    "note that in the euclidean plane with the unit circle as basic curve , this choice of @xmath57 gives the usual angle measure , and that we get the usual rotations as generalized rotations by choosing @xmath127 to be the origin @xmath1 .",
    "an advantage of this choice is affine invariance , but there is also a big disadvantage .",
    "namely , the length of the arc @xmath115 containing the domain of the angle can not be calculated easily from this angle measure .",
    "( as a known example , we note that the calculation of the arc - length of an ellipse leads to a complete elliptic integral of second kind , which has no closed - form solution in terms of elementary functions . ) in this paper we have to create tools for the so - called _ rolling process _ , which is a type of motion that combines rotation and translation of an object with respect to a given curve .",
    "more precisely , we combine two curves such that they are in contact with each other without sliding ( no friction ) . hence we have to compare the angle of rotations of the two curves by the fact that the swept arc - lengths do agree in the time of the moving .",
    "this requires a nice connection between the angle of the generalized rotation and the corresponding arc - length of the basic curve @xmath115 .",
    "consider again the euclidean plane with a cartesian coordinate system , and let @xmath115 be the nephroid of the unit circle with cusps on the @xmath24-axis , and @xmath127 be the origin .",
    "we define the _ nephroid _ as an epi - cycloid created when a circle with diameter @xmath128 rolls on the unit circle ( see fig . [ nephroidfig ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the parametric equation @xmath129 of it is @xmath130 where @xmath131 are the polar coordinates of the point @xmath132 .",
    "denote by @xmath133 that point of the @xmath24-axis for which @xmath134 is the common tangent of the two circles at @xmath135 . if @xmath90 is the second intersection point of the half - line @xmath136 by the rolling circle , then the line @xmath137 intersects a point @xmath127 of the nephroid from the rolling circle . in figure [ nephroidfig ]",
    "we can see the construction of two points @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "one of the curiosities of the nephroid is that there is a closed form to its arc - length function on the upper coordinate half plane .",
    "the length of the arc containing the points with parameters between the values @xmath140 is equal to @xmath141 .",
    "the generalized rotation at the origin with respect to the nephroid ( and its arc - length based angle measure ) sends the ray @xmath142 to the ray @xmath143 , with angle measure @xmath144 hence the three - fold distance of the vertical segments @xmath145 for @xmath146 represents the absolute value of the angle of the rays @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "( thus the points @xmath147 are on the @xmath24-axis , respectively . )",
    "hence we can construct the rotated image of any point @xmath127 of the nephroid as follows :    [ nephroidfig ]   +    assume that the point @xmath127 is on the upper half of the nephroid . by the intersection of the @xmath24-axis and a vertical line through the point @xmath135 we determine the point @xmath148 ,",
    "consider the directed segment @xmath149 and mark it off from @xmath148 on the @xmath24-axis .",
    "if the obtained point @xmath150 is on the horizontal diameter @xmath151 of the unit circle , then we can determine that point @xmath152 from the unit circle which is above @xmath150 and corresponds with the searched point @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath150 is not on the diameter , then we mark off that outer subsegment @xmath153 of @xmath154 from @xmath155 in the relative interior of @xmath151 , and denote the obtained point of @xmath156 by @xmath150 . in this case",
    "our construction gives an image point which is on the upper half of the nephroid .",
    "it is obvious that , analogously , this construction can also be extended to the lower half of the nephroid .",
    "the standard angle in the euclidean plane can be obtained by considering arc - lengths in the unit circle , and hence the angle theory can be given in terms of the euclidean norm .",
    "of course , this can be carried over to minkowski planes , and the general rotations given by the arc - length measure are possibly the most natural rotations in normed planes .",
    "we head now to take a better look at this particular case .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the minkowski arc - length of a curve defined in the usual way : as the supremum of the sums of the lengths of the polygonal approximations of @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath157 be a closed rectifiable jordan curve starlike with respect to an inner point @xmath68 , and denote by @xmath158 the normalized minkowski arc - length measure in @xmath69 .",
    "formally , if @xmath159 , then    @xmath160    of course , @xmath158 is a generalized measure in the sense of definition [ genmeasure ] . since the measure @xmath158 is induced by the geometry of the plane rather than being inherent to @xmath69",
    ", one may wonder how the group @xmath161 does rely on the initial @xmath69 and @xmath68 that we have chosen .",
    "for example , in the euclidean plane we can obtain the standard angle measure by considering the arc - length measure in any homothet of the unit circle and doing the usual normalization .",
    "our next lemma shows that this is also true for arbitrary minkowski planes .",
    "let @xmath162 be a closed rectifiable jordan curve starlike with respect to an inner point @xmath68 , and let @xmath158 be the ( normalized ) minkowskian arc - length measure .",
    "given @xmath86 , denote by @xmath163 the curve @xmath164 homothetical to @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath165 .",
    "it is enough to prove that any rotation of @xmath161 preserves the length of the arcs of the homothetical curves @xmath163 .",
    "if @xmath69 is smooth , then we can consider a regular parameterization @xmath166 of @xmath69 and the associated parametrization of @xmath163 given by @xmath167 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath168 where @xmath159 are arbitrary points , and @xmath169 and @xmath170 are their respective images in @xmath163 by the considered homothety .    if @xmath69 is not smooth , we just have to notice that every polygonal approximation of @xmath69 can be obtained homothetically for @xmath163 .",
    "despite having the good property shown above , the arc - length rotations are not at all linear transformations . for this reason we may face some difficulties when trying to derive closed formulas for them .",
    "but we have some exceptions .",
    "next we give an example for the minkowski arc - length rotation which coincides with an usual euclidean rotation .",

    "]    translations are a simple kind of motion in minkowski planes , and they are clearly isometries .",
    "the general rotations can also be seen as motions in the minkowski plane , which are not necessarily isometries .",
