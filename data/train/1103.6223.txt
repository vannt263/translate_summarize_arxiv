    "the idea of unlimited energy growth ( also known as the fermi acceleration ) due to the repeated collisions of particles with a moving wall was introduced by enrico fermi @xcite in 1949 as an attempt to explain the acceleration of cosmic rays .",
    "he proposed a very simple model where charged particles could be accelerated by collisions with moving magnetic field structures .",
    "his original model was later modified and studied considering different approaches .",
    "many of them take into account the inclusion of external fields , simplifications , damping coefficients , quantum and relativistic effects .",
    "one of the most important versions of this problem is the well known fermi - ulam model ( fum ) .",
    "this model consists of a classical point particle of mass @xmath0 , bouncing between two rigid walls .",
    "one of them is assumed to be fixed while the other one moves according to a periodic function .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this system has a very rich phase space structure in the sense that , depending on the initial conditions and control parameters , one can observe invariant spanning curves , chaotic seas and kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands .",
    "later on pustylnikov @xcite replaced the fixed wall existing in the fermi - ulam model by a constant gravitational field @xcite the so - called bouncer model . despite the similarity between the two models",
    ", there is a huge difference between them mainly regarding the average velocity of the particle for long time . in the fermi - ulam model",
    "it was rigorously proved by pustylnikov that the existence of invariant curves in the phase space always prevents the unlimited energy growth @xcite although other workers provided an evidence for such a conclusion @xcite . on the other hand , for specific combinations of both control parameters and initial conditions",
    "the phenomenon of unlimited energy growth can be observed in the pustylnikov bouncer model .",
    "this surprising result was later discussed and explained by lichtenberg and lieberman @xcite and can be easily understood by looking at the phase space .",
    "the fum has a set of invariant spanning curves limiting the size of the chaotic sea ( as well as the particle s velocity ) , but such invariant tori are not observed in the bouncer model and the energy can typically grow unbounded .",
    "a natural extension of the one dimensional billiard models are the two - dimensional billiard systems .",
    "basically they are classified ( i ) integrable , ( ii ) ergodic and ( iii ) mixed . in case ( i )",
    "the phase space consists of invariant tori filling the entire phase space and typical examples are the circular and the elliptical billiard whose the integrability in the case of the circle comes from the angular momentum conservation , and the product of the angular momenta with respect to the foci in case of ellipse @xcite . in case ( ii )",
    "the time evolution of a single initial condition is enough to fill the phase space and two examples are the bunimovich stadium @xcite and the sinai billiard @xcite . in case ( iii ) , there is a representative number of billiards that present mixed phase space structure @xcite .",
    "one important property in the mixed phase space is that chaotic seas are generally surrounding kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands which are confined by invariant spanning curves @xcite .",
    "in particular such curves can cross the phase plane and partition it into several separated portions of the phase space .",
    "one of the main questions about two dimensional time - dependent systems is : under what conditions the unlimited energy growth will be observed ? in this sense , a conjecture was proposed by loskutov - ryabov - akinshin ( lra ) @xcite and later it was proved by gelfreich and turaev @xcite .",
    "this conjecture , known as lra - conjecture , states that the existence of a chaotic component in the phase space with static boundary is a sufficient condition to observe fermi acceleration when a perturbation is introduced . very recently",
    "leonel and bunimovich @xcite extended the conjecture to the existence of a heteroclinic orbit in the phase space instead of the existence of a set with chaotic dynamics .",
    "results that corroborate the validity of this conjecture include the time - dependent oval billiard @xcite , stadium billiard @xcite and lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "lenz et al .",
    "@xcite observed that after a time - dependent perturbation is introduced the separatrix gives place to a chaotic layer and the particle s velocity can grow unbounded .",
    "initially it was proposed that the acceleration exponent was controlled by the driven amplitude of the boundary @xcite .",
    "later , when extensive simulations were taken into account , the authors observed that when the number of collisions with the boundary is large enough the acceleration exponent is the same independent of the driving amplitude @xcite .",
    "such result has been confirmed in @xcite and it is studied in more details in the present paper .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of a classical particle confined in a time - dependent closed region of elliptical shape .",
    "our main goal is to describe and understand the behaviour of the average velocity as a function of the number of collisions with the boundary using scaling arguments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the necessary details to define the four - dimensional mapping that describes the dynamics of the system , and our numerical results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "in this section we discuss all the details required for the construction of the mapping .",
    "the two - dimensional driven elliptical billiard consists of a classical point particle of mass _ m _ confined into a closed region within which it is freely moving and is suffering elastic collisions with the time - dependent boundary .",
    "we stress that the particle is not affected by any external field and travels freely on a straight line until it reaches the boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we describe the dynamics of the system in terms of a four - dimensional nonlinear mapping @xmath1 that gives : the angular position is the canonical parameter of the ellipse ( called the eccentric anomaly in astronomy ) and is not the angle @xmath2 between the position vector @xmath3 and the x - axis ( polar angle ) .",

    "this is done because in a 4d phase space it is difficult or even meaningless to consider individual pointwise initial conditions .",

    "we will concentrate on the influence of the initial velocity @xmath54 on the behaviour of the average velocity .",

    "as one can see , all curves of the @xmath65 behave quite similarly in the sense that : ( a ) for short @xmath10 , up to @xmath70 the average velocity remains constant equal to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 means initial plateau , and ( b ) after a crossover for @xmath73 , all the curves start to grow with the same exponent .",
    "for such a behaviour we propose the following hypotheses , which turn out to describe the empirical facts :    1 .   for short @xmath10 ,",
    "say @xmath74 , @xmath65 behaves according to @xmath75 and if the initial plateau is well defined we of course expect @xmath76 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath77 ,",
    "the average velocity is given by @xmath78 where the exponents @xmath79 and @xmath80 are critical exponents , namely the initial and acceleration exponents , respectively .",
    "the crossover iteration number @xmath53 that marks the change from constant velocity at the initial plateau to the growth is written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the third exponent , called the crossover exponent .    with these three assumptions , from the method of @xcite",
    ", we suppose that the average velocity is described in terms of a scaling function of the type @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the scaling factor , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are scaling exponents . if we chose @xmath87 , then @xmath88 and eq . ( [ eq616 ] )",

    "( [ eq614 ] ) we find @xmath98 .",
    "considering the two different expressions for the scaling factor @xmath84 , the condition of the crossover exponent is @xmath99 , and we find    @xmath100    note that the scaling exponents are determined if the critical exponents @xmath79 and @xmath80 are numerically obtained . the exponent @xmath80",
    "is obtained from a power law fitting for the average velocity when @xmath97 .",
    "thus , an average of these values gives @xmath101 ( see fig .",

    "additionally , considering the fact that the critical exponents are @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 we can conclude that the conservative time dependent elliptical billiard belongs to the same class of universality like the conservative time - dependent lorentz gas @xcite for the range of the control parameters considered .",
    "as a conclusion of the present paper , we have studied some dynamical properties of a time - dependent elliptical billiard considering elastic collisions with the boundary .",
    "we have shown that the average velocity for short time remains constant but after a crossover it starts to grow with exponent @xmath112 .",
    "we have shown that such a behaviour can be described using scaling properties and we have found an analytical relation between the critical exponents @xmath80 , @xmath79 , and @xmath82 ( acceleration , initial and crossover exponents , respectively ) .",
    "our scaling hypotheses are confirmed by a good collapse of all the curves of the average velocity onto a single universal plot , therefore confirming that the model is scaling invariant and also that it belongs to the same class of universality of the time - dependent lorentz gas for the range of the control parameters considered .",
