    "we calculate a second model assuming the dust size distribution and disk dust mass from the `` high dust opacity model '' by @xcite .",

    "the present detection of the o - h@xmath1o  and p - h@xmath1o  lines at 557 , 1113 ghz in the tts dg tau is crucial for several reasons : ( i ) so far , emission in the fundamental water lines has been observed only in one tts , tw hya ; ( ii ) we detect for the first time a double - peaked profile in the h@xmath1o  lines , which is a strong kinematic evidence for an origin in the outer disk ( from @xmath101 au ) ; ( iii ) water turns out to be a unique tracer of the protoplanetary disk of dg tau , because is less contaminated by envelope / outflow emission than co lines ; ( iv ) once corrected for distance the h@xmath1o  lines are @xmath0 times brighter than in tw hya . according to our models , the reason is the 10 times higher uv flux of dg tau , which heats the outer disk surface layer up to temperatures of @xmath145  k ( only @xmath146  k in the case of tw hya ) .",
    "in addition , the disk around dg tau is more massive and compact leading to higher volume densities in the surface layers , which makes the warm neutral chemistry even more efficient ; ( v ) the adopted models suggest a disk mass of 0.0150.1 m@xmath2 , depending on the assumed dust size distribution , and a water reservoir ( gas+ice ) of 7100 m@xmath16 , i.e. at least a factor of a few larger than estimated for tw hya @xcite .",
    "while the inferred disk mass is consistent with the minimum mass of the solar nebula to form our solar system , the detection of water vapor in the outer region of the disk , where comets are believed to form , and the estimated water mass of a few @xmath147 earth oceans , supports the scenario of impact delivery of water on terrestrial planets by means of icy bodies .",
