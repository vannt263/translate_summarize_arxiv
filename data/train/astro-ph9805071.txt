    "whereas the gravomagnetic field has _ no time delay _ and is uniform within the shell in the gravity problem , nevertheless the magnetic field travels inwards from the shell , _ has a time delay _ and is therefore non - uniform in the electromagnetic problem . the origin of this difference can be traced to the fact that gravity as a tensor field does not carry any dipolar waves , so a collapsing slowly rotating shell generates none of them . thus the dipole contributions in gravity are governed by an instantaneous equation not a wave equation .",
    "the uniform @xmath11 inside a rotating shell is dipolar , and thus reacts instantaneously in a frame in which its center is at rest . in electricity",
    "the monopole contributions are governed by the instantaneous gauss s theorem and remarkably that instantaneous relationship between @xmath12 and the included charge holds in all lorentz frames !",
    "however in electromagnetism there are dipolar waves and a collapsing rotating spherical shell generates them . the increase in @xmath11 as the shell collapses and rotates faster travels inwards from the shell .",
    "this difference in the time delay behavior has therefore a good physical origin , nevertheless , all physicists shy away from instantaneous effects as acausal",
    ". how can it be that the internal inertial frames rotate at once without waiting for a causal signal to travel inwards from the shell ?    whereas local inertial frames can be determined locally their rotations and accelerations relative to inertial frames at infinity depend on a convention of how such frames are extended inwards .",
    "there is nothing wrong with conventions that travel with the speed of thought. one may consider the andromeda nebula at one moment and jerusalem a second later , so thoughts can travel far faster than light .",
    "thus , when we find that the inertial frame within a collapsing rotating spherical shell rotates rigidly with no time delay between the center and the shell s inner edge , we should not claim some spooky faster than light influence , rather we should look at the way we define the rotation of a reference frame .",
