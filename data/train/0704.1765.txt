    "given a fixed extinction curve , the two quantities have a simple scaling relation . in the case of the galactic center extinction curve",

    "we use the best - fit continua of our irs spectra to derive monochromatic luminosities ( @xmath52 ) in two pure continuum regions .",
    "we pick 5.8@xmath6 m  due to its sampling the hot dust continuum just shortward of the 6.2@xmath6 m  pah feature , and 14@xmath6 m  for its sampling the continuum between the 9.7@xmath6 m  and 18@xmath6 m  sio absorption features ( it is a minimum in the gc extinction curve see figure  [ pah_template ] ) .",
    "we read these luminosities from the best - fit continuum fits not directly from the data .",

    "the irac and mips70@xmath6 m  photometric points allow us to sample the seds of our sources outside of the regions covered by the irs spectra ( see  [ cont - fit ] ) . here",
    "we quantify the emission shortward and longward of the available spectra by deriving the monochromatic 1.6@xmath6 m  and 30@xmath6 m  emission wherever possible . as discussed in ",
    "[ cont - fit ] , the irac points ( rest - frame @xmath113@xmath6 m ) are likely to be sensitive to direct stellar emission from the host galaxy , which has a characteristic bump at 1.6@xmath6 m .",
    "we only accept that we are likely seeing host galaxy light if : 1 ) the source is detected in both 3.6@xmath6 m  and 4.5@xmath6 m , and 2 ) if the spectral shape changes color from the dust continuum ( e.g. yes for mips15949 , but no for mips15958 ) .",
    "these data do not allow us to explore the properties of the stellar populations .",
    "all we can address is the amplitude of the host galaxy emission whenever present .",
    "to do so we subtract from the irac points the mid - ir continuum ( truncated below @xmath15@xmath6 m  as described in  [ cont - fit ] ) , and perform a simple linear fit using a 10gyr - old stellar population template @xcite .",
    "the choice of template here is irrelevant , as it merely allows us to find the amplitude of the host galaxy emission ( quantified via the monochromatic 1.6@xmath6 m  luminosity ) .    on the other hand at @xmath0@xmath181.6 , the mips70@xmath6 m  point samples restframe @xmath130@xmath6 m . if it is present , this traces the colder dust emission dominating the typical star - forming galaxy s sed .",
    "we therefore fit a 50k thermal emission to the mips70@xmath6mpoint , whenever it is in excess of the truncated power - law continuum .",
    "we emphasize that , as in the case of the stellar population , the current data do not allow us to determine the sed peak ( and hence dust temperature ) .",

    "we return to this point in  [ sec_hotdust ] .",
    "the inner dust tori around agn can be heated to near sublimation temperatures ( @xmath110001500k ) , which dominates the mid - ir spectra provided these hot regions are not obscured ( e.g. pier & krolik 1992 ) .",
    "such emission peaks in the @xmath136@xmath6 m  region leading to ( type 1 ) agn to have flatter @xmath1515@xmath6 m  spectral slopes ( @xmath25@xmath11 , e.g. 3c273 ) than the typical starburst ( @xmath25@xmath13 , e.g. ngc7714 ) .",

    "the longer wavelength sed is dominated by cold dust of @xmath6450k associated with star - formation . in  [ sec_excess ] and figure  [ mirspec ] , we show that many of our sources show very warm spectra peaking at @xmath130@xmath6 m , while others show an excess over the mid - ir continuum , consistent with the presence of cooler dust .",
    "these were used to derive @xmath52(30@xmath6 m ) ( see table  [ lums_table ] ) for sources with @xmath0@xmath641.6 such that the mips70@xmath6 m  point is not too redshifted away from restframe 30@xmath6 m .",
    "figure  [ luminos ] , shows that while the @xmath15@xmath6m - to-15@xmath6 m  colors are the same for both pah - rich and pah - poor sources ( as is the case for the entire sample ) , the @xmath115@xmath6m - to-30@xmath6 m  colors separate the two groups very well .",
    "our pah - poor sources are redder than the optically - selected quasars consistent with their being dustier .",
    "our pah - rich sources are generally consistent with the starbursts colors although they show slightly bluer @xmath1515@xmath6 m  slopes suggesting enhanced hot dust .",
    "we expand on the last point , now using the entire sample , in figure  [ lum5_lum7 ] , where we show the hot dust continuum luminosity @xmath65 vs. the 7.7@xmath6 m  pah luminosity .",
    "for lower luminosity star - forming sources , the two are well correlated with slope unity suggesting at least _ at moderate luminosities _ , the mid - ir seds of purely star - forming galaxies are fairly constant .",
    "as expected , optically - selected quasars have stronger 5.8@xmath6 m  continuum  per 7.7@xmath6 m  luminosity .",
    "our weak - pah sources , at higher luminosities , are consistent with the local agns trend , despite their redder slopes .",
    "although , to a lesser extend , our strong - pah sources are also noticeably shifted with respect to the local starbursts .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this :    \\1 ) they have significant agn contributions leading to enhanced 5.8@xmath6 m  continuum .",
    "\\2 ) the local starburst trend does not extend to the highest luminosities regime , but curves toward our strong - pah sources making them starburst - dominated as well .",
    "in other words , extreme starbursts generate enhanced hot dust emission compared with lower luminosity ones .",
    "the first explanation is very likely given the extreme luminosities of our sources .",
    "as discussed in  [ ew7 ] , our equivalent width cut is more an upper limit on the starburst - dominated sources , since especially borderline sources are likely to include significant agn contribution as well .",
    "therefore , we also look individually at the @xmath0@xmath12 sources with strongest pah emission ( @xmath58@xmath82@xmath6 m , or @xmath7@xmath80.3@xmath6 m ) .",
    "even these strongest pah sources , show excess emission at @xmath44@xmath186@xmath6 m , relative to the typical starburst ( see figure  [ strongpahstacks ] ) , indicating higher hot dust contribution .",
    "figure  [ strongpahstacks ] also shows that our strong - pah sources are similar to ngc6240 in that respect , which was already interpreted by @xcite as having @xmath120% agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath150% of the mid - ir emission ; @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "hot dust emission has been observed to be associated with star - formation activity as well @xcite .",
    "an extreme example , are high sfr intensity dwarf galaxies which show continuum - dominated mid - ir spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility of enhanced hot dust emission being associated with extreme starbursts can not be excluded .",
    "we conservatively adopt the first explanation above , but stress that the properties of high - luminosity , pure - starbursts remain unclear .",
    "it has been proposed that the presence of the 1.6@xmath6 m  bump , characteristic of stellar populations older than @xmath1100myrs , is an efficient way of separating starburst- from agn - dominated sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rationale is that the hot dust continuum  of agn overwhelmes their host galaxy s stellar bump .",
    "figure  [ mirspec ] shows that the irac points ( which probe the 1.6@xmath6mstellar bump at @xmath0@xmath12 ) often ( in 73% of the sources ) have excess emission over the extrapolated mid - ir continuum .",
    "this excess is most likely the 1.6@xmath6 m  stellar bump of old stellar populations together with some unknown young stars contribution ( see  [ sec_excess ] ) .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ lumh_lum7 ] shows the 1.6@xmath6 m  luminosity vs. the pah luminosity .",
    "both our pah - rich and pah - poor sources ( where the excess is observed ) obey the relation defined by the local star - forming galaxies .",
    "this suggests that even in the continuum - dominated sources ( with a few exceptions ) we do not see the agn itself ( accretion disk emission ) , but the host galaxy light alone .",
    "circumstantial support is provided by optically - selected quasars whose 1.6@xmath6 m  luminosities ( mcleod & rieke 1994a , b ) lie significantly to the right of the star - forming galaxies relation .",
    "although not shown for clarity , the agn - subtracted h - band luminosities of the pg qsos ( mcleod & rieke 1994a , b ) agree much better with the star - forming galaxies relation suggesting the offset is predominantly due to the effect of agn - dominance at 1.6@xmath6 m  rather than suppressed 7.7@xmath6 m  emission .    the last point is supported by the right - hand panel of figure  [ lumh_lum7 ] shows @xmath52(1.6@xmath6 m ) vs. the 7.7@xmath6 m  pah feature luminosity both normalized to the 5.8@xmath6 m  continuum .",
    "the effect of increasing hot dust emission is now obvious , as there is a clear trend between the starforming galaxies , our pah - rich and pah - poor sources .",
    "the pg qso sample have the same 7.7@xmath6 m  feature strength relative to the 5.8@xmath6 m  as our pah - poor sources , but show an excess of 1.6@xmath6 m  emission .",
    "lastly , these results have implications for agn - selection methods such as the irac color - color diagram ( see lacy et al .",
    "2004 , stern et al .",
    "2005 , sajina , lacy , scott 2005 , lacy et al .",
    "these rely on the power - law continuum in the irac band of agn , and the pah , and stellar bump features in the spectra of starbursts . in sajina ,",
    "lacy , & scott ( 2005 ) , we stressed that this might fail at @xmath0@xmath12 due to the unknown fraction of agn whose host galaxies dominate at @xmath44=1.6@xmath6 m .",
    "figure  [ irac_ccd ] shows the irac color - color plot for our sample .",
    "about 20% of the continuum - dominated sources fall outside of the agn regime due to host galaxy emission as discussed above .",
    "this assumes that the sources undetected in more than 1 irac band and therefore not included in figure  [ irac_ccd ] are undetected due to steeply falling red continua and would have fallen inside the agn - wedge . since our sample is biased toward less prominent hot dust , this is an upper limit for the agn population as a whole .",
    "it does however , imply that the use of this technique to search for obscured agn , although remarkably effective at lower-@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) becomes less reliable at @xmath0@xmath82 .",
    "the depth of the 9.7@xmath6 m  silicate feature has recently been highlighted @xcite as a tool to distinguish between sources dominated by buried nuclei from sources with more clumpy , extended dust distributions .",
    "@xcite presented an intriguing diagnostic diagram of the pah6.2 equivalent width vs. the 9.7@xmath6 m  silicate feature depth .",
    "sources with weak silicate features , range from pure starbursts to pure agn in the manner of traditional pah - over - continuum diagnostics .",
    "a distinct secondary sequence of increasing silicate feature depth with decreasing pah feature strength is revealed . this is interpreted as an increasingly dominant buried nucleus .    for low signal - to - noise , high-@xmath0 samples such as ours , the equivalent diagram is based on the 7.7@xmath6 m  pah feature strength , and the optical depth estimate ( figure  [ pah_tau ] ) .",

    "as we increase the optical depth the observed fractions remain constant , while the intrinsic fractions curve since the un - extincted @xmath66 is higher than the observed one .",
    "we mark @xmath27=1 as separating optically thin from optically thick sources , which is also where extinction correction effects become strong .",
    "this largely corresponds to the separation between class 1 and class 2 sources in @xcite , or in other words between sources with clumpy dust ( weak silicate feature ) or buried nucleus sources ( significant silicate feature ) .",

    "although about 25% of these sources have significant pah emission , after extinction correction @xmath190% of these highly obscured sources are continuum - dominated .",
    "it is important to realize that since our sensitivity to weak pah emission ( even using the 7.7@xmath6 m  feature ) is worse than for the local sample used by spoon et al .",

    "given that our sample of @xmath0@xmath12 extremely obscured sources is incomplete , we derive a lower limit density of @xmath17@xmath50@xmath69mpc@xmath68 .",
    "these estimates are uncertain to within a factor of 2 , but clearly suggest that the density of such objects was about an order of magnitude larger at @xmath0@xmath12 than today .",
    "we presented spectral decomposition of a sample of 48 @xmath70 , low resolution mid - ir irs spectra .",
    "the detailed analysis , separating the contribution of pah emission , continuum  emission and continuum  extinction , has revealed several significant characteristics of @xmath70 ulirgs .    in paperi , we discussed that our sources have quasar - like luminosities , and frequently continuum - dominanted spectra suggesting an agn is the primary power source .",
    "we find that 75% of our sample have continuum - dominated spectra .",

    "all of these suggest that the bulk of our sources are potentially related to the still elusive type-2 quasars .",

    "these @xmath70 strong - pah sources likely all have significant agn contribution to their mid - ir emission , as evidenced by excess hot dust emission . however , their bolometric emission is likely still dominated by the starburst ( by analogy with sources such as ngc6240 , and the observed hints of colder dust at longer wavelengths ) .",

    "the strong similarity between the mid - ir spectrum of the nascent starburst ngc1377 @xcite and the deep silicate feature ulirg iras08572 + 3915 suggest that even in sources with weak or absent pah , a buried nucleus can be powered by either agn or a young starburst ( or more likely both ) .",
    "high resolution mid - ir spectra with neon line ratios , deep x - ray spectra , l - band ( 34@xmath6 m ) spectroscopic diagnostics could provide useful additional information , but uncertainties due to high obscuration would remain ( see e.g. discussion on arp220 , * ? ? ?",

    "establishing the frequency of such sources , compared with the clearly starburst - like and agn - like ulirgs , any possible evolution with redshift and luminosity would be the first steps to test whether this is a necessary evolutionary stage that all ulirgs pass , or an alternate pathway depending on the properties of the merging components . from our sample",

    "<S> about 3/4 of our sample are continuum- ( i.e. agn ) dominated sources , but @xmath160% of these show pah emission , suggesting the presence of star - formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> these sources have redder mid - ir colors than typical optically - selected quasars . </S>",
