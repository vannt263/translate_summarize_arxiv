    "accurate simulations of ballistic transport through quantum dots have remained a computational challenge , despite the conceptional simplicity of the problem .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that many of the most interesting phenomena occur in a parameter regime of either high magnetic field @xmath0 or high fermi energy @xmath1 .",
    "the regime of strong magnetic field @xmath0 , where the magnetic length ( in a.u . )",
    "@xmath2 is small compared to the linear dimension @xmath3 of the dot , @xmath4 , gives rise to the quantum hall effect,@xcite the hofstadter butterfly,@xcite and aharonov - bohm oscillations of transport coefficients.@xcite the high energy domain , where the de broglie wavelength @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 , is of particular relevance for approaching the semiclassical limit of quantum transport and for investigations of quantum signatures of classical chaos.@xcite both of these regimes pose considerable difficulties for a numerical treatment .",
    "methods based on the expansion of the scattering wavefunction in plane or spherical waves become invalid at high fields since diamagnetic contributions are generally neglected.@xcite methods employing a discretization on a grid are limited by the constraint that the magnetic flux per unit cell must be small , which , in turn , requires high grid densities for large @xmath0.@xcite the same requirement has to be met for high @xmath1 , where many grid points are needed to accurately describe the continuum limit .",
    "this implies however a large number of inversions of high - dimensional matrices and therefore limits the applicability of these approaches for large @xmath0 and ( or ) large @xmath1 .",
    "+ in the current communication we propose an approach that allows accurate treatment of these regimes .",
    "we present an extension of the previously@xcite introduced _ modular recursive green s function method _ ( mrgm ) to include an additional magnetic field perpendicular to the two - dimensional scattering surface .",
    "the underlying idea for our approach goes back to sols _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite and to the widely used _ recursive green s function method _ ( rgm).@xcite in the standard rgm the green s function",
    "is propagated through the scattering region from one transverse strip to the next by repeated solutions of a matrix dyson equation .",
    "we show that the efficiency of this conventional discretization can be increased considerably by taking the symmetries of a scattering problem into account from the outset .",
    "specifically , when the two - dimensional nonseparable open quantum dot can be built up out of simpler separable substructures ( referred to in the following as modules ) , the green s functions for each of these modules can be calculated efficiently and virtually exactly .",
    "calculation of the @xmath7 matrix and of the scattering wavefunction is thus reduced to `` welding '' together the modules by a very small number of recursions .",
    "key to this approach are tight - binding grids which are symmetry - adapted for each module .",
    "this leads to the separability of the eigenfunctions in the modules and allows an efficient incorporation of boundary conditions . as a result",
    ", a much higher grid density can be easily handled , which , in turn , is prerequisite for treating short magnetic lengths @xmath8 and short wave lengths @xmath9 .",
    "matrix dyson equations have to be solved only for each junction between the modules . the total number of necessary recursions ( i.e.  high - dimensional matrix inversions ) is thereby reduced to the number of modules needed to reconstruct the quantum dot .",
    "+ the efficiency of the mrgm will be demonstrated by applying it to transport through a circular and a stadium shaped quantum dot .",
    "these systems are known as prototype structures for regular and chaotic dynamics and have been studied thoroughly in the literature.@xcite concerning the theoretical approaches for the investigation of electron dynamics in quantum dots , considerable attention has been dedicated to reach higher energies@xcite and higher magnetic fields.@xcite especially for the study of transport through open stadium billiards , several different methods have been employed.@xcite in the following we will present numerical results obtained by the mrgm which attain a parameter range , to our knowledge not yet explored by other approaches . for small @xmath10",
    "we investigate the localization of the scattering wavefunction near classical scattering trajectories .",
    "characteristic differences in the dynamics of generically regular and chaotic systems will be highlighted . in the high magnetic field regime , which is governed by edge states , differences between the dynamics in different geometries disappear and are replaced by universal quasi - periodic conductance oscillations . at a critical magnetic field",
    "these oscillations break off and transport terminates entirely . in the regime where more than one edge state is excited in the dot , we find interference fluctuations which we analyze in terms of a multi - channel fano interference model.@xcite the key to the understanding of the observed fluctuations is that inter - channel scattering between different edge states takes place only by diffractive scattering at the lead junctions . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ii the method for inclusion of a magnetic field in the mrgm is presented .",
    "section iii is dedicated to a discussion of numerical results , illustrating the high magnetic field and high energy behaviour in quantum dots .",
    "the paper concludes with a short summary in section iv .",
    "we consider ballistic nanostructures with a constant electrostatic potential inside the two - dimensional cavity , impose hard - wall boundary conditions , and assume a constant magnetic field to be oriented perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the shape of the quantum dot will be chosen to be either a circle or a stadium ( see figs .",

    "two semi - infinite waveguides of width @xmath11 at different electrochemical potentials ( @xmath12 ) are attached .",
    "the aperture of the leads is chosen to be very small @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scaled area of all the cavities studied and @xmath3 is a characteristic linear dimension of the cavity . at asymptotic distances ,",
    "i.e.  far away from the quantum dot , scattering boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the asymptotic scattering state can be factorized into a longitudinal flux - carrying plane wave and a transverse standing wave .",
    "the latter is a simple sine wave in the field - free case and a combination of kummer functions when the magnetic field is turned on.@xcite in our local coordinate system the longitudinal ( transverse ) direction in the @xmath15-th lead is always denoted by @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the wavefunctions in the waveguides thus vanish at @xmath18 .",
    "atomic units @xmath19 will be used from now on , unless explicitly stated otherwise .      in order to highlight the technical difficulties in incorporating a magnetic field we start by briefly reviewing the mrgm for the field - free case .",
    "starting point is the observation that a large class of dot geometries with non - separable boundaries can be decomposed into separable two - dimensional substructures , referred to in the following as modules . for each of these modules",
    "the discretization of the corresponding tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian can be performed on a symmetry - adapted grid .",
    "the grid for each module is chosen such that the eigenfunctions of the tb hamiltonian @xmath20 separate into two generalized coordinates .",
    "@xmath21 contains hopping potentials @xmath22 for nearest - neighbour coupling and site energies @xmath23 .",
    "both quantities are chosen such that the schrdinger equation , @xmath24 , converges towards the continuum schrdinger equation in the limit of high grid point density .",
    "the most straightforward application of this approach refers to modules for which the boundaries are nodal lines of cartesian ( @xmath25 ) or polar coordinates ( @xmath26 ) . for these coordinate systems",
    "we have @xcite at @xmath27 @xmath28 with @xmath29 . for separable energy eigenfunctions of the general form @xmath30 the spectral representation of the retarded @xmath31 and advanced @xmath32 green s function @xmath33 of the module",
    "is simply given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 stand for the ( generalized ) coordinates @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "the indices @xmath38 represent the quantum numbers of the separable eigenfunctions @xmath39 associated with the degrees of freedom @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",

    "the matrix @xmath45 denotes the hopping potential @xmath46 multiplied by the size of the unit cell @xmath47 , which in a cartesian ( polar ) grid is @xmath48 .",
    "the complete scattering structure can thus be assembled from the individual modules ( much like a jigsaw puzzle ) .",
    "the number of necessary recursions [ i.e.  solutions of ( [ 2.4 ] ) ] is ( approximately ) equal to the number of modules .",
    "the exact number depends on the number of link modules required for different grid structures . for example , in order to connect a half - circle with a rectangle we need one additional link module which is plugged in between [ see ref .   for details ] .",
    "the key property of these link modules is their adaption to two grid symmetries [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ] .",
    "mathematically speaking , the transition from a polar to a cartesian grid requires a link module in order to preserve the hermiticity of the tb hamiltonian at the junction . in the recursion",

    "+ once the green s function @xmath50 for the combination of all modules is assembled , the transmission amplitudes @xmath51 from entrance lead mode @xmath52 into exit lead mode @xmath53 can be calculated by projecting @xmath50 onto the transverse wavefunctions in the leads @xmath54 . with the corresponding longitudinal wave numbers",

    ", the total conductance @xmath60 through the quantum dot is given by @xmath61      incorporation of the magnetic field into the mrgm poses a number of complications .",
    "the solutions of these difficulties will be presented in this section . at the core of",
    "the problem is the preservation of separability of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the usage of gauge transformations as well as of dyson equations for decomposing non - separable structures into separable substructures plays a key role in accomplishing this goal .",
    "the field @xmath62 enters the tb hamiltonian ( [ eq : tbhamilton ] ) by means of a peierls phase factor,@xcite @xmath63\\,,\\ ] ] with which the field - free hopping potential @xmath64 is multiplied .",
    "the vector potential @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66 .",
    "the peierls phase will , of course , in most cases destroy the separability of the eigenfunctions of @xmath21 .",
    "the difficulties can be , in part , circumvented by exploiting the gauge freedom of the vector potential , i.e. , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a scalar function . by an appropriate choice of @xmath69",
    "the wavefunction remains separable on a given symmetry adapted grid .",
    "specifically , to preserve separability we employ the landau gauge for a cartesian grid    @xmath70    and the `` symmetric '' or circular gauge for a polar grid @xmath71    the scalar gauge potential generating the gauge transformation from ( [ 2.10a ] ) to ( [ 2.10b ] ) is @xmath72 .",
    "+ a major complication results from the fact , that in the presence of the magnetic field the separability on an unrestricted grid of a given symmetry does not imply the separability in the presence of boundary conditions of the same symmetry .",

    "consider , for notational simplicity , the schrdinger equation in the continuum limit , @xmath76 since the longitudinal momentum @xmath77 commutes with @xmath78 , the separability of the wavefunction persists in the presence of the magnetic field : @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "if , however , one introduces an additional cartesian boundary condition along the @xmath81-axis [ i.e.  @xmath82 for a semi - infinite lead ] the situation changes . in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath27 , the linear term in @xmath83 vanishes and",
    "thus the choice @xmath84 [ i.e.  a linear combination of @xmath85 satisfies the boundary condition and preserves the separability , even though @xmath83 is no longer conserved in the semi - infinite lead .",

    "the wavefunction takes now the general form @xmath88 the breakdown of separability by the introduction of an additional boundary condition indicates that the green s function of confined modules will be more complex than for extended systems for the same symmetry adapted grid and the same gauge .",
    "therefore , the program of the modular method of building - up extended complex structures by `` welding together '' smaller modules of higher symmetry will be executed in reverse : non - separable confined modules will be generated by `` cutting in pieces '' larger separable modules .",
    "confining boundary conditions will be introduced rather than removed by the matrix dyson equation . in the example above , the _ semi - infinite _ quantum wire is generated by cutting the _ infinite _ wire at the line @xmath89 , thereby imposing the additional boundary condition . just as connecting modules , so is disconnecting a given module equivalent to the application of a matrix dyson equation , @xmath90 in this context @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is the green s function of the extended ( confined ) module and @xmath45 is the hopping potential that connects the modules . solving ( [ 2.13 ] ) _ in reversed mode _",
    "( i.e.  for @xmath92 rather than for @xmath91 ) amounts to dissecting the larger module . +",
    "provided that the green s functions of all the necessary modules are available , we have to link them with each other to assemble the entire scattering geometry . however , in the presence of a magnetic field we have to take into account that the different modules will be calculated in different symmetry - adapted gauges .",
    "joining different modules requires , therefore , in general a gauge transformation .",
