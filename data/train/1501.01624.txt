    "the search for a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) in an atom is motivated by the fact that it signifies violation of parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetries in the fundamental laws of physics @xcite . the basic idea is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : edm_t ] . from the wigner - eckart theorem",
    ", we know that the total angular momentum vector is the only vector in the body - fixed frame , in the sense that all others vectors must be proportional to it . applied to the edm vector @xmath3 , this implies that @xmath4 under time reversal operation , @xmath5 ( which is equal to @xmath6 ) changes sign , whereas @xmath3 does not .",
    "thus , in the time - reversed world @xmath7 which shows either that @xmath8 , or that a non - zero @xmath9 implies t violation . the argument for p violation is similar  under p transformation , the ( polar ) vector @xmath9 changes sign , whereas the ( axial ) vector @xmath5 does not .     and @xmath10 .",
    "since the edm vector @xmath3 has to point in the direction of @xmath5 , it has to be zero unless t is violated . ]    since t violation in leptons has not been observed directly @xcite , edm searches are among the most important experiments in atomic physics today . along with charge conjugation ( c ) , there is a theorem  the cpt theorem  which says that the combined operation of these three symmetries is always obeyed in nature @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the observation of cp violation in neutral kaon decay @xcite implies t violation .",
    "this is accommodated in the standard model of particle physics by predicting edms for fundamental particles like the electron and the neutron , but the value of the edm predicted is about 8 to 10 orders - of - magnitude smaller than current experimental precision .",
    "however , theories that go beyond the standard model  such as supersymmetry ",
    "predict edms within experimental range . as a consequence ,",
    "such theories are strongly constrained by experimental limits on edms .",
    "the intrinsic edm of the electron @xmath11 gets enhanced in heavy paramagnetic atoms  like cs and tl  due to relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the best current limits of @xmath12 e - cm has been placed through a measurement on an atomic beam of tl atoms @xcite . but this beam experiment is limited in precision by the systematic error arising due to the motional magnetic field @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "polar molecules like ybf and tho are not susceptible to this kind of error .",
    "such molecules have the additional advantage that they are more sensitive to @xmath11 than atoms for the same value of the laboratory e field . as a consequence , experiments using the molecule",
    "ybf have resulted in a similar limit on the electron edm of @xmath14 e - cm @xcite , and there is a proposal from this group to improve the limit using laser - cooled molecules launched in a fountain @xcite .",
    "an order - of - magnitude improvement in precision has come from a recent measurement on the molecule tho at the acme collaboration , and sets a limit of @xmath15 e - cm @xcite .    in earlier work @xcite",
    ", we have proposed a new technique to measure the existence of an edm in cs atoms using a paraffin - coated vapor cell .",
    "this method is also not susceptible to errors due to the motional magnetic field because the * average * velocity inside a vapor cell is zero .",
    "our technique is called chopped nonlinear magneto - optic rotation ( chopped - nmor ) , and allows us to measure the larmor precession frequency with high precision .",
    "the signature of an edm is a shift in the larmor frequency correlated with the application of a large e field .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate the use of this technique to do an edm measurement with an applied e field of 2.6 kv / cm . from this",
    ", we put an upper limit on the atomic edm of @xmath16 e - cm ( @xmath2 confidence ) , which implies that @xmath17 e - cm using the enhancement factor of 120.53 in cs @xcite .",
    "though this is not competitive with the best measurement for the electron edm , there are foreseeable improvements to the technique which will enable us to reach a precision better than the current best value .",
    "as shown in our earlier work in ref .",
    "@xcite , the chopped nmor technique relies on the laser beam measuring the rotation being modulated on and off . during the on time",
    ", the atoms are optically pumped into a @xmath18 coherence of the ground state ( atomic alignment ) . during the off time , the atoms freely precess around the magnetic field at the larmor frequency @xmath19 . if the chopping frequency matches @xmath20 ( the factor of 2 appears because the alignment has 2-fold symmetry ) , then the rotation is resonantly enhanced in every cycle .    applying the wigner - eckart theorem to the total angular momentum @xmath21 of the atom ,",
    "both the magnetic moment @xmath22 and electric dipole moment @xmath3 have to point along @xmath21 .",
    "hence the interaction energy of the atom in the presence of the two fields is @xmath23 the quantization axis of the atoms is defined by the direction of the b field .",
    "the larmor precession frequency is determined by the energy spacing between two adjacent magnetic sub levels , i.e.  @xmath24 .",
    "it is therefore given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the land @xmath27 factor of the level and @xmath28 is the bohr magneton . in the presence of an additional e field  in the same direction to maintain the quantization axis  the larmor precession frequency changes to @xmath29 where @xmath11 is",
    "the permanent edm of the electron and @xmath30 is the edm enhancement factor in the atom .",
    "this shows that if the atom has an electric dipole moment , then there will be a change in the larmor precession frequency when the e field is applied .    in a chopped - nmor experiment , the chopping frequency",
    "is kept constant while the b field is scanned . in the absence of an e field , we get two peaks at @xmath31 and @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 @xmath34 in the presence of an additional e field , and since the chopping frequency is the same , the peaks move to a new location given by @xmath35 @xmath36 using the fact that the e term is much smaller than the b term .",
    "one way to understand this is that the quantization axis  set by the b field ",
    "is opposite for the two signs of the b field , therefore , the constant e field contributes with different signs to the two values .      from the above expressions , the separation of the peaks are @xmath37 and the corresponding centers are @xmath38 = 0   \\\\",
    "c_{\\rm with \\ ,",
    "e } & = \\dfrac{1}{2 } \\left [ b_+^e + b_-^e \\right ] = - \\dfrac{2d_e\\eta e}{g_f \\mu_b } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the edm signal appears as a change in the center of the two peaks proportional to the e field , with no concomitant change in the peak separation .      in order to understand this effect",
    ", we assume that there is a stray magnetic field with a longitudinal component @xmath39 and a transverse component @xmath40 . since the atom precesses around the magnitude of the total field , the larmor precession frequency changes .",
    "for a given chopping frequency , one gets new peaks with a separation of @xmath41 and a center given by @xmath42 thus , a stray magnetic field will cause both the separation and center of the peaks to change , but only the longitudinal component will mimic the edm signal .",
    "the experimental setup is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : edm_setup ] . the laser beam is derived from a commercial diode laser system ( toptica dl pro ) , operating on the 852 nm d@xmath43 line of cs ( 6s@xmath44 6p@xmath45 transition ) .",
    "the isotope used for the experiment has a mass number @xmath46 , and nuclear spin @xmath47 .",
    "the output of the laser comes out of a polarization maintaining fiber .",
    "the fiber goes into a 95/5 power splitter , with 5% of the power fed into a compact saturated - absorption spectroscopy ( cosy ) unit .",
    "the signal from the unit coupled with current modulation of the diode laser produces an error signal so that the laser can be locked to any peak in the cosy spectrum .",
    "for the experiment , the laser is locked to the @xmath48 crossover resonance of @xmath0cs , which is about 125.5 mhz below the @xmath49 hyperfine transition .",
    "this frequency shift is provided by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the aom serves two additional purposes : ( i ) providing control of the beam power by controlling the rf power going into the aom , and ( ii ) allowing chopping of the laser beam by doing on - off modulation of the aom driver .",
    "the frequency of the aom is set using a function generator ( hp 8656b ) .",
    "the timebase of the function generator is set using a commercial rb clock ( sim 940 ) with @xmath50 relative stability .",
    "the frequency output of the function generator is internally modulated for the chopping , and its output amplitude is computer controlled to adjust the beam power .    the remaining 95% of the laser output ( after the power splitter ) is coupled to free space using a fiber coupler .",
    "the beam size after the coupler ( @xmath51 diameter ) is 3 mm .",
    "the rf power driving the aom is adjusted to get a laser beam power of 100 w. it goes into a spherical cs vapor cell with 75 mm diameter and paraffin coating on the walls .",
    "the cell is inside a 3-layer magnetic shield ( magnetic shield corp , usa ) with a shielding factor of better than @xmath52 .",
    "the longitudinal b field required for the chopped nmor measurement is achieved by placing the cell inside a solenoid coil .",
    "the coil is wound on an acrylic form of 190 mm diameter , and consists of 1800 turns of 0.35 mm magnetic wire wound over a length of 640 mm .",
    "the voltage on the solenoid coil is set using a 24 bit ni daq card with a range of @xmath53 to @xmath54 v. this voltage is varied to scan the b field .",
    "the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light gets rotated in the vapor cell due to the phenomenon of nmor .",
    "the output beam is split into its two polarization components using a wollaston prism .",
    "the power in each component is measured using photodiodes .",
    "the powers in the two components are made equal ( in the absence of an nmor signal ) by adjusting the @xmath55 waveplate after the cell .",
    "when the angle of rotation is small , the optical rotation can be shown to be proportional to the difference in the two pd signals @xcite .",
    "hence , the difference signal is demodulated in a commercial lock - in amplifier ( sr 830 ) .",
    "the out - of - phase component of the lock - in amplifier is used in the experiment .",
    "the data is acquired to the computer using the same daq card used for setting the solenoid voltage .",
    "the e field required for the edm measurement is applied using two plates with equal and opposite high voltage on them .",
    "this ensures that the value of the high voltage at each plate is only half of what is required for a given e field , and hence ensures that breakdown at each plate is minimized .",
    "the plates are made of polished aluminium and spaced 85 mm apart using teflon rods .",
    "they have dimensions of 130 mm diameter and 40 mm thickness , with rounded edges to minimize the e field magnitude at the corners",
    ". the plates also have a 6 mm hole at their centers to allow the laser beam to pass through .",
    "statistical errors arise due to the following .",
    "a.   errors in the curve - fitting routine used for determining the peak centers , arising due to the finite linewidth and finite signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the peaks .",
    "b.   random variation in the location of the peaks due to jitter in the function generator used for driving the aom .",
    "this is minimized by locking the function generator to an ultra - stable rb atomic clock , as described in the `` experimental details '' section . c.   errors in the voltage applied to the solenoid coil used for scanning the b field .",
    "d.   shot - to - shot variation in the stray b field in the lab , arising due to movement of heavy metallic objects .",
    "note that a constant b field will not cause an error because the effect will be the same from one measurement to the next .",
    "this is important because there are many sources of stray b fields in our building , but fortunately most of them are static .",
    "the good thing about statistical errors is that they average to zero .",
    "thus , all the above sources of error can be reduced below any required level by taking more data . but",
    "this makes sense only if systematic errors can be kept below the same level .",
    "the analysis in the `` theoretical analysis '' section shows that the main source of systematic error will be the appearance of a * longitudinal * b field correlated with the application of the e field , because other errors such as due to e and b field gradients are negligible .",
    "one potential source of such an e - correlated field is leakage current between the plates when the high voltage is applied .",
    "note that a leakage current along the rods holding the two plates will only cause a transverse field , and hence will not affect the edm measurement .",
    "however , there could be a small current that makes it through the air gap between each plate and the solenoid coil .",
    "this will cause a longitudinal b field , and hence mimic the edm signal .",
    "however we have an experimental handle to deal with this error , namely to repeat the experiment with the other @xmath56 level of the ground state of @xmath0cs , namely @xmath57 .",
    "the cancellation of systematic error due to a longitudinal b field relies on the fact that the land @xmath58 factor values for the two levels are equal and opposite . from our previous analysis ,",
    "the shift in the peak center in the presence of both e and b fields is @xmath59 this shows that the shift due to the e field will be opposite for the two ground levels ( since they have @xmath60 values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , but the shift due to the b field will be the same .",
    "thus the difference between the two measurements will give us an edm measurement without the systematic error due to the presence of a time - varying b field .",
    "in effect , the other level acts as a co - magnetometer , similar to the use of rb atoms in a cs vapor cell as demonstrated by us in ref .",
    "@xcite and proposed by others for edm measurements @xcite .",
    "the use of the other hyperfine level is a novel feature of our technique , and is reported for the first time for atomic edm measurements .",
    "the experiment consists of measuring multiple curves of the kind shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : nmor ] . for each curve ,",
    "the voltage on the solenoid coil is varied from @xmath63 to @xmath54 v in variable steps .",
    "the slight asymmetry in the two peaks is because of imperfect shielding by the magnetic shield , which results in a small residual longitudinal b field .",
    "this is also evident in the curve shown from the fact that the center of the two peaks is located not at 0 but at the point where the applied field cancels the residual field . at each value of the voltage ,",
    "the output of the lock - in amplifier is averaged 1000 times at intervals of 1 ms , therefore the measurement at each point lasts 1 s. fig .",
    "[ fig : nmor ] shows that the density of points along the @xmath64 axis is not constant .",
    "this is because there are more points near the peaks where there is more signal , than near the zero crossing where there is negligible signal .",
    "the total number of points in each curve is 70 , therefore it takes 70 s to complete a curve .",
    "the solid line in the figure is a curve fit to two lorentzian peaks along with a linear baseline ( to account for the linear mor effect ) .",
    "the curve fit yields the centers of the two lorentzian peaks , from which the curve center is determined .",
    "this process is repeated 18 times .",
    "the average value of this set then yields a value of @xmath65 .",
    "the same procedure is repeated with an e field applied , which gives a value of @xmath66 .",
    "thus , each set consists of 18 values of @xmath65 , and 18 values of @xmath66 .",
    "the difference @xmath67 combined with the value of the e field then yields one measurement of the edm as follows @xmath68 the relevant values for our case are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 kv / cm .        the first set of measurements comprised of measurements of @xmath72 a total of 50 times . the average value and standard deviation  statistical error",
    " yields @xmath73    the main source of systematic error in our measurement is the appearance of a leakage current through the air gap between the plates and the solenoid . since the leakage current appears only when the high voltage is applied , it is correlated with the application of the e field .",
    "however , only that part of the leakage current that makes it through the solenoid will appear as correlated longitudinal b field , and hence mimic the edm signal .",
    "leakage current through the teflon rods holding the two plates , and any charging currents during the transient build up of the e field , will only contribute to a transverse field , and hence not appear as a systematic error .",
    "we estimate the size of this error by doing the following calculation .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the plate is a cylinder of finite length placed within another cylinder of infinite length , the resistance of the air gap is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the resistivity of air , @xmath76 is the inside diameter of the solenoid , @xmath77 is the outside diameter of each field plate , and @xmath78 is the thickness of the plate . for our dimensions ,",
    "the value of resistance is @xmath79 , which causes a leakage current of the order of @xmath80 pa .",
    "this will cause a leakage field of @xmath81 which will result in an edm of @xmath82 since this is 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the statistical error in our measurement , we use only the statistical error in the edm measurement . from this",
    ", we put an upper limit on the electron edm of @xmath83 the standard deviation has been increased by a factor of 1.96 to get a @xmath84 confidence level .",
    "the following improvements in the technique will enable us to increase the precision of the measurement .",
    "a.   better shield  the current 3-layer shield has a shielding factor of @xmath52 .",
    "there is a 4-layer design described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which will improve the shielding by a factor of 100 .",
    "this should give us a corresponding decrease in the linewidth , and hence reduce the uncertainty in determining peak centers .",
    "b.   better cell  the present cell has paraffin coating on the walls .",
    "we next plan to use a cell with alkene coating on the walls , as described in ref .",
    "this will increase the relaxation time by a factor of 100 , and result in a correspondingly smaller linewidth . c.   higher e field ",
    "the current field is limited by electrical breakdown of air at sharp points on the field plates .",
    "we expect to use a field that is 100 times larger by evacuating the entire assembly .",
    "the increased field will result in a direct improvement in the precision of the measurement .",
    "this will also result in a smaller leakage current .",
    "d.   longer time  as mentioned before , each curve takes about a minute to complete .",
    "therefore , the entire set of 1800 curves is completed in less than 1 day .",
    "this can easily be increased by a factor of 100 , which should result in a increase in statistical precision of a factor of 10 .    together",
    ", the above improvements will result in a factor of @xmath85 increase in _ statistical _ precision .",
    "if systematic errors can also be kept under control  maybe by measuring on the other ground hyperfine level  then our measurement has the potential to become the best edm measurement .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated a new technique for the measurement of the electron edm . the method uses chopped nmor in an anti - relaxation coated cs vapor cell at room temperature .",
    "we analyze errors in the technique , and show that a leading source of systematic error ( due to an e - correlated longitudinal b field ) can be eliminated by doing measurements on the two ground hyperfine levels .",
    "one significant advantage of our technique compared to other methods is that the charging current as the e field builds up will cause only a transverse b field to appear , which is not a source of systematic error .    using an e field of 2.6 kv / cm",
    ", we set a limit of @xmath86 e - cm .",
    "the most precise limit comes from a measurement on the molecule tho , which is about 6 orders - of - magnitude below our limit",
    ". however , there are easily implementable improvements to the technique that should enable us to reach a precision below this value .",
