    "since its launch in 2009 , nasa s _ kepler _ telescope has discovered more than 3000 transiting planetary candidates , more than one third of which are the members of multi - transiting systems @xcite . with longer observation",
    "spans , the detection limits have been extended to smaller and longer - period planets , and even a compact solar - system analog has been recently discovered @xcite .",
    "characterization of such multi - planetary systems ( not necessarily transiting ) is especially valuable because reproducing the architecture of multiple planets is theoretically more demanding than for a single planet , and hence the resulting constraints on the formation theories become much tighter .    fortunately , multi - transiting systems exhibit various features advantageous for their confirmation and characterization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these include transit timing variations ( ttvs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , deviations of transit times from the strict periodicity due to the mutual gravitational interaction among the planets . by modeling the ttvs of several transiting planets consistently",
    ", we can precisely estimate their masses , which are usually inaccessible with the photometric observations alone .",
    "the ttvs become especially prominent for planets in near mean - motion resonances @xcite , which turned out to amount to several percent of the _ kepler _ sample @xcite .",
    "indeed , planetary masses obtained from ttvs are all the more valuable for systems for which radial velocities are difficult to obtain , as are the cases for most of the _ kepler _ target stars .",
    "a wealth of the _ kepler _ data has also revealed a new phenomenon called a planet - planet eclipse ( ppe ) , which was first and only observed in the kepler-89 ( koi-94 ) system @xcite . in this event ,",
    "two planets transit the host star simultaneously and even overlap with each other on the stellar disk .",
    "in addition to its rareness and astronomical interest , this phenomenon tightly constrains the relative angular momentum of the two planets involved , which could give some clues to unveil the history of their orbital evolutions through the presence or absence of dynamical planet - planet interaction .",
    "this paper focuses on the kepler-51 ( koi-620 ) system , one of the multi - transiting systems found by _",
    "kepler_. this system hosts three transiting planet candidates , two of which were confirmed by @xcite .",
    "they made sure that these two planets , kepler-51b ( koi-620.01 ) and kepler-51c ( koi-620.03 ) , are revolving around the same star by confirming that their ttvs are anti - correlated , and showed that they are indeed planetary by giving mass upper limits based on the long - term stability of the system . in this paper , we perform a numerical analysis of their ttvs to more fully characterize the system and to confirm that the mass of koi-620.02 is also in the planetary range .",
    "we also discuss a very intriguing light curve of kepler-51 recently made public on the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) mast archive , which shows a feature similar to a ppe event .",
    "we adopt the stellar properties in table [ par_star ] taken from the nasa exoplanet archive . as an initial guess for the limb - darkening coefficients for the quadratic law , we adopt @xmath9 , the values for @xmath10 in the grid of .",

    "we first extract data points within @xmath52 day of every transit , and iteratively fit the points outside the transit with a third - order polynomial until all the out - of - transit outliers exceeding @xmath53 are excluded .",
    "then we divide all the points in the chunk by the best - fit polynomial to give a detrended and normalized transit light curve . also excluding the transits that are not fully observed , we obtain @xmath54 , @xmath51 , and @xmath55 transits for kepler-51b , kepler-51c , and koi-620.02 , respectively .",
    "we note that the kepler-51b s transit around @xmath56 occurred simultaneously with that of koi-620.02 ( double transit ) .",
    "since this particular transit shows a possible sign of a ppe @xcite , we will discuss it in more detail in section [ sec : ppe ] .",
    "from the transit light curves obtained in section [ sec : dataprocess ] , we determine the transit times and transit parameters of the three planets by iterative fit using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm .",
    "we repeat the following two steps : ( i ) we fit each transit for the time of the transit center @xmath57 using the light curve model by @xcite . here",

    "are extracted by linear regression .",
    "( ii ) using the transit times obtained in step ( i ) , we phase fold the transits of each planet and fit the three phase curves simultaneously for @xmath59 , @xmath38 ( of each planet ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . here the values of @xmath26 are fixed at those in step ( i ) and @xmath58 is assumed for all the planets .",
    "starting from the values in table [ ppar_prior ] ( and in section [ sec : parameters ] for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , all the parameters converge sufficiently well after five iterations .",
    "the resulting transit parameters , ephemerides , and transit times are summarized in tables [ ppar_5th ] to [ tc_02 ] .",
    "the quoted best - fit parameters ( @xmath63 to @xmath64 and @xmath57 ) denote the median values of their posteriors , and uncertainties exclude @xmath65 of values at upper and lower extremes .",
    "the corresponding best - fit transit models with the phase - folded transits are shown in figure [ phase ] .",
    "as reported in previous analyses @xcite , we find significant ttvs for all three planets as shown in figure [ ttv_fit ] .",
    "note that the ttv amplitude of koi-620.02 in our analysis is about twice as large as that first reported by @xcite , who analyzed the first twelve quarters of _ kepler _ data .",
    "several comments should be added to our revised values of transit parameters in comparison to those in table [ ppar_prior ] . with the longer baselines ,",
    "we refine the orbital periods of the three planets with better precision than the previous values .",
    "we also find the larger values for @xmath59 , albeit with relatively large uncertainties .",
    "this is because the slight variations of transit depths we identify in the archived light curves , probably due to the star - spot activities ( see also the discussion in section [ sec : ppe ] ) .",
    "in fact , our analysis completely neglects such spot effects , and so the values of @xmath59 we determined may be overestimated .",
    "the constraint on @xmath59 is especially poor for kepler-51c , whose grazing transit causes the strong correlation between its planetary radius and impact parameter .",
    "the values of impact parameters we determine are marginally consistent with those in table [ ppar_prior ] , corresponding to the slightly different value of stellar density ; these parameters would be determined more precisely with spectroscopic constraints on the stellar mass and radius .",
    "in addition , we find that the difference between the impact parameters of kepler-51b and koi-620.02 is tightly constrained due to the strong correlation , in spite of their relatively large uncertainties : the mcmc posteriors for the two parameters yield @xmath66 . since this difference is closely related to the minimum separation during a simultaneous transit of the two planets , it has an important role in assessing the occurrence of the ppe , as will be discussed in section [ sec : ppe ] .    cccc parameter & kepler-51b & kepler-51c & koi-620.02 + @xmath22 @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 + @xmath26 ( days ) & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + @xmath30 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 + @xmath34 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + @xmath38 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 + @xmath60 & + @xmath61 & + @xmath83 & + @xmath84 & +    cccccc transit & @xmath57 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 + number&@xmath67 & & & & ( days ) + 0 & 159.10975 & 0.00072 & 0.00072 & 2.14 & @xmath89 + 1 & 204.26437 & 0.00078 & 0.00076 & 1.86 & @xmath90 + 2 & 249.41453 & 0.00120 & 0.00152 & 3.24 & @xmath91 + 3 & 294.57446 & 0.00251 & 0.00159 & 2.12 & @xmath92 + 4 & 339.72399 & 0.00083 & 0.00088 & 2.32 & @xmath93 + 5 & 384.87799 & 0.00078 & 0.00079 & 4.04 & @xmath94 + 6 & 430.03405 & 0.00076 & 0.00076 & 1.78 & @xmath95 + 8 & 520.34240 & 0.00151 & 0.00168 & 0.80 & @xmath96 + 9 & 565.49926 & 0.00106 & 0.00148 & 3.29 & @xmath97 + 10 & 610.65682 & 0.00087 & 0.00095 & 1.00 & @xmath98 + 11 & 655.81302 & 0.00080 & 0.00084 & 1.38 & @xmath99 + 12 & 700.97595 & 0.00204 & 0.00156 & 2.19 & @xmath100 + 13 & 746.12646 & 0.00082 & 0.00086 & 1.10 & @xmath101 + 14 & 791.28654 & 0.00102 & 0.00129 & 1.79 & @xmath102 + 15 & 836.43982 & 0.00074 & 0.00074 & 2.24 & @xmath103 + 16 & 881.59882 & 0.00072 & 0.00071 & 0.91 & @xmath104 + 17 & 926.75475 & 0.00083 & 0.00078 & 1.42 & @xmath105 + 18 & 971.90566 & 0.00181 & 0.00262 & 1.95 & @xmath106 + 19 & 1017.05878 & 0.00083 & 0.00088 & 1.62 & @xmath107 + 20 & 1062.21217 & 0.00075 & 0.00075 & 2.50 & @xmath108 + 21 & 1107.36887 & 0.00095 & 0.00097 & 0.94 & @xmath109 + 22 & 1152.52090 & 0.00088 & 0.00088 & 0.96 & @xmath110 + 23 & 1197.67687 & 0.00097 & 0.00097 & 0.87 & @xmath111 + 24 & 1242.83059 & 0.00087 & 0.00087 & 0.99 & @xmath112 + 25 & 1287.98482 & 0.00086 & 0.00088 & 0.92 & @xmath113 + 26 & 1333.14289 & 0.00091 & 0.00090 & 0.95 & @xmath114 + 27 & 1378.29779 & 0.00088 & 0.00088 & 0.86 & @xmath115 + 28 & 1423.45442 & 0.00091 & 0.00090 & 1.00 & @xmath116 + 29 & 1468.61324 & 0.00089 & 0.00089 & 0.97 & @xmath117 +    cccccc transit & @xmath57 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath118 + number & @xmath67 & & & & ( days ) + 0 & 295.31257 & 0.00378 & 0.00384 & 0.98 & @xmath119 + 1 & 380.64295 & 0.00358 & 0.00354 & 0.97 & @xmath120 + 2 & 465.95289 & 0.00287 & 0.00283 & 1.41 & @xmath121 + 3 & 551.26161 & 0.00319 & 0.00304 & 0.99 & @xmath122 + 4 & 636.56677 & 0.00324 & 0.00325 & 2.04 & @xmath123 + 7 & 892.51469 & 0.00384 & 0.00393 & 1.90 & @xmath124 + 8 & 977.84149 & 0.00360 & 0.00364 & 1.16 & @xmath125 + 10 & 1148.45861 & 0.00327 & 0.00327 & 1.00 & @xmath126 + 11 & 1233.80785 & 0.00322 & 0.00324 & 0.89 & @xmath127 + 12 & 1319.11072 & 0.00331 & 0.00342 & 0.95 & @xmath128 + 14 & 1489.75414 & 0.00337 & 0.00340 & 0.88 & @xmath129 +    cccccc transit & @xmath57 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath130 + number & @xmath67 & & & & ( days ) + 0 & 212.02417 & 0.00066 & 0.00066 & 2.67 & @xmath131 + 1 & 342.20715 & 0.00063 & 0.00062 & 2.28 & @xmath132 + 2 & 472.39116 & 0.00064 & 0.00064 & 2.08 & @xmath133 + 3 & 602.57341 & 0.00063 & 0.00063 & 2.17 & @xmath134 + 5 & 862.93196 & 0.00076 & 0.00070 & 3.88 & @xmath135 + 6 & 993.10424 & 0.00064 & 0.00065 & 2.35 & @xmath136 + 7 & 1123.28307 & 0.00065 & 0.00066 & 1.12 & @xmath137 + 8 & 1253.44963 & 0.00062 & 0.00063 & 0.89 & @xmath138 + 9 & 1383.62994 & 0.00064 & 0.00064 & 0.99 & @xmath139 +",

    "this value of @xmath195 , along with the values of @xmath59 in table [ ppar_5th ] and @xmath145 in table [ ttv_result ] , gives the radius and density of each planet listed in table [ planet ] .",

    "nevertheless , these results show that the bulk densities of all the planets in the kepler-51 system are arguably among the lowest of the known planets , falling below that of the recently discovered sub - saturn radius planet koi-152d @xcite .    while their densities are much lower than those of the planets in the solar system , it is possible to form such planets with sufficiently rich gas envelopes .",
    "@xcite calculated the radii of low - mass ( @xmath196 ) planets for various values of envelope fraction ( @xmath197 ) , incident flux ( @xmath198 ) , and age ( @xmath199 ) . according to their equation 3 , the observed radii of the kepler-51 planets can be explained if they have about @xmath200 ( kepler-51b ) , @xmath201 ( kepler-51c ) , and @xmath202 ( koi-620.02 ) of their masses in their h / he envelopes , for the age of @xmath203 .",

    "on the other hand , it seems more difficult to explain how they acquired the above fractions of h / he envelopes .",
    "although the simulations by @xcite ( see , e.g. , their table 2 ) show that such planets could be formed by core - nucleated accretion beyond the snow line followed by the inward migration to @xmath205 , their results are based on the somewhat arbitrary assumption that the planet migrates after the sufficient growth of its core and envelope . in situ accretion @xcite",

    "indeed , we find several transits of koi-620.02 showing brief brightenings of similar amplitudes ( @xmath229 ) as seen in this double - transit light curve .",
    "in addition , this double transit occurred during a gradual increase of the stellar flux , which indicates that a large star spot ( or a group of star spots ) was moving on the visible side of the star at that time . however",
    ", as we mentioned in the last part of section [ sec : transit ] , the small difference of their impact parameters obtained from the transit light curves requires that the ppe _ should _ have occurred in this double transit , provided that ( i ) their orbital planes are nearly aligned and that ( ii ) their cosine inclinations have the same signs . since the inner planet kepler-51b overtakes the outer one koi-620.02 in this double transit , the minimum sky - plane separation becomes small enough under these conditions .",
    "motivated by this fact , we fit the observed double - transit light curve with the ppe model by @xcite for @xmath230 , the longitude of the ascending node of koi-620.02 relative to that of kepler-51b . note that here we choose the plane of the sky as a reference plane , and so @xmath230 corresponds to the mutual inclination of the two planetary orbits in this plane ( see also the lower panel of figure [ ppe_best ] ) .",
    "also note that , in the following , we consider a general case where @xmath230 can take any value from @xmath231 to @xmath232 , though we only discussed the aligned ( @xmath233 ) case above as a motivation for the ppe scenario .",
    "this is because , in general , the occurrence of a ppe event is not limited to the aligned case @xcite .",
    "the other parameters @xmath59 , @xmath38 , and @xmath62 are also floated except for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which are fixed at the values in table [ ppar_5th ] .",
    "while we restrict the impact parameter @xmath38 of kepler-51b to be positive , we allow @xmath38 of koi-620.02 to be either positive or negative , taking into account that the two planets can have different signs of cosine inclinations . using an mcmc algorithm",
    ", we find that this model gives a reasonably good fit with @xmath234 , and obtain @xmath235 for the sky - plane mutual inclination of the two planets ( figure [ ppe_best ] and table [ ppe_fit ] ) .",
    "this value , if true , indicates that the orbital planes of kepler-51b and koi-620.02 are significantly misaligned , which means that either of their orbital axes are tilted with respect to the stellar spin axis .",
    "this result may be in contrast to the spin - orbit alignments observed in five multi - transiting systems so far @xcite , but agrees with the recent discovery that the spin - orbit misalignment is not confined to hot - jupiter systems @xcite .",
    "however , if their orbits are really significantly misaligned , it follows that this multi - transiting system is a rare object .",
    "for example , the conditional probability @xmath236 that the outer koi-620.02 transits when the inner kepler-51b is known to transit is @xmath237 for the mutual inclination of @xmath238 and @xmath239 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . this value is smaller by the factor of @xmath240 than in the aligned case , where @xmath241 .",

    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ ppe_search ] , where we examine the validity of the ppe model for all the possible values of the two planets impact parameters . in this plot ,",
    "the color scale shows the minimum value of the @xmath159 difference between the ppe and non - ppe models , found by incrementing @xmath230 by @xmath257 from @xmath231 to @xmath232 .",
    "the grid scale of @xmath38 is @xmath256 , and the other parameters are fixed at the best - fit values in table [ ppe_fit ] . in the dark - blue region ,",
    "the ppe model significantly improves the fit , while the dotted green lines correspond to the constraint from the phase - folded transits we mentioned in section [ sec : transit ] .",
    "comparing these two regions , we find that only the values of @xmath38 close to the ppe best fit ( red point with error bars ) are consistent with the ppe interpretation of the bump .",
    "moreover , the impact parameters required by the ppe model are only marginally consistent with those obtained in section [ sec : transit ] ( table [ ppar_5th ] ) , though they are close to the ones obtained by the _",
    "kepler _ team ( table [ ppar_prior ] ) .",
    "it should also be noted that , if the orbit of the outermost planet has such a large mutual inclination with respect to the inner two , their orbits will precess rapidly . in this case , the resulting transit duration variations ( tdvs ) would be fairly large for the middle grazing planet , kepler-51c .",
    "nevertheless , no significant tdvs are apparently seen in the transits of this planet ( figure [ phase ] ) . with no constraints on the nodal angle of kepler-51c ,",
    "it may still be possible that the orbit of this planet is also tilted with respect to that of kepler-51b so that the effect of precession is canceled out , but it would require fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "furthermore , we must happen to observe this system when all the planets have small eccentricities as indicated from ttvs , while their eccentricities would vary as the system evolves under such a large mutual inclination .",
    "these arguments about the transit probability , impact parameters , and expected orbital precession , imply that a ppe event that is consistent with all of the observations would be exceedingly rare ; in other words , the ppe interpretation for the observed anomaly is essentially refuted .",
    "the observed bump is , therefore , probably due to a star spot or just a correlated noise .",
    "if it is the spot crossing , the detailed star - spot modeling may provide valuable information on the stellar obliquity , which is closely related to the orbital evolution history of the planets .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "there are several possible approaches to strengthen the above interpretation of the anomaly .",
    "first , follow - up observation of the next double transit where a ppe event might occur is unreasonable , because we have to wait at least until 2092 even if the orbital planes of the two planets are completely aligned .",
    "secondly , the more accurate determination of the impact parameters would be helpful . if it is confirmed that the impact parameters of the two planets differ from zero with better precision , the discussion based on figure [ ppe_search ] is enough to exclude the ppe scenario .",
    "in contrast , if both planets have @xmath260 as suggested by the _ kepler _ team ( table [ ppar_prior ] ) , we need to explain why the two planets _ did not _ overlap ; if @xmath233 in this case , we should have observed a large bump that is totally inconsistent with the observed one . in order to better determine the impact parameters , the better constraint on @xmath195 ( or @xmath62 itself ) would again be quite beneficial , because the prior knowledge on @xmath62 pins down their values , which are strongly correlated to that of @xmath62 .",
    "lastly , as mentioned above , a thorough analysis of the dynamical model taking account of mutual orbital inclinations and ( if necessary ) star spots would provide a more decisive conclusion on the origin of this anomaly . yet another possibility is the analysis of the long - term dynamical stability , which may rule out the misaligned configuration .",
    "we have discussed the two topics in this paper , characterization of the multi - transiting planetary system around kepler-51 with ttv analysis ( sections [ sec : transit ] and [ sec : ttv ] ) and interpretation of the light - curve feature similar to a ppe caused by the two planets in this system ( section [ sec : ppe ] ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize each of the topics and give some additional comments .",
    "+ * 1 . characterization of the kepler-51 system .",
    "*    we analyzed the transit light curves and ttvs of the three planets in the kepler-51 system , which lie close to a @xmath3 resonance chain . combining the planetary masses obtained from ttvs , and planet - to - star radius ratios and stellar density inferred from the transit light curves",
    ", we determined the properties of the three planets as follows : @xmath261 for kepler-51b ( koi-620.01 ) , @xmath262 for kepler-51c ( koi-620.03 ) , and @xmath263 for koi-620.02 . from these results , as well as the sinusoidal modulation",
    "consistent with their proximities to the resonances , we confirmed koi-620.02 as a planet in this system ( kepler-51d ) , which has an equilibrium temperature close to the inner edge of the habitable zone .",
    "the even more remarkable implication of our analysis is that the densities of all three planets in this system are among the lowest yet determined , though a more detailed study taking account of the presence of star spots might increase these values .",
    "in fact , such low - density planets are frequently seen in other compact multi - transiting planetary systems ; these include the systems around kepler-9 @xcite , kepler-11 @xcite , kepler-18 @xcite , kepler-30 @xcite , kepler-56 @xcite , kepler-87 , kepler-89 @xcite , and koi-152 @xcite , all of which have planets with sub - saturn densities .",
    "considering the fact that such systems frequently contain giant planets and planet pairs in near mean - motion resonances ( and , of course , that they are the multi - transiting systems ) , they were probably formed via the convergent disk migration and subsequent resonance capture . as pointed out by @xcite , the selection effects for planets suitable for the ttv analysis could be significant .",
    "nevertheless , if the low - densities observed so far are intrinsic features of compact multi - transiting systems , they could be an important constraint on the formation mechanisms via disk migrations .",
    "+ * 2 . anomaly similar to a planet - planet eclipse event .",
    "*    we also analyzed the double - transit light curve of kepler-51b and koi-620.02 around @xmath56 .",
    "the archived _ kepler _ light curve shows a slight increase in the relative flux of kepler-51 , which could be explained by the ppe ( planet - planet eclipse ) , the overlap of the two planets during their double - transit phase .",
    "if the cosine inclinations of the two planets have the same signs , the impact parameters of the two planets strongly suggest that the ppe should have occurred in this double transit .",
    "indeed , the ppe model well reproduces the observed anomaly for the sky - plane mutual inclination between the two planets of @xmath264 , which implies that their orbital planes are misaligned .",
    "this result , if true , indicates that either of their orbital planes are tilted with respect to the stellar spin axis , and makes the kepler-51 system another important piece of evidence that the spin - orbit misalignment is not confined to hot - jupiter systems @xcite",
    ".    however , this interpretation of the anomaly seems unlikely for the following reasons .",
    "first , such a large mutual inclination significantly reduces the probability that both of kepler-51b and koi-620.02 transit .",
    "second , the ppe model is consistent with the result of phase - curve analysis only for limited values of the two planets impact parameters . finally , the misaligned configuration would result in the rapid orbital precession , whose effect should have been readily detectable in the transit light curves of the middle grazing planet , kepler-51c .",
    "alternative interpretations of the anomaly include the correlated noise and the star - spot crossing .",
    "if the latter is the case , it may provide us the information on the stellar obliquity , which is definitely valuable in unveiling the orbital evolution history of the planets in this system .    in any case , it is rewarding to explore the origin of this anomaly , because it serves as an example of the false positive of a ppe event . compared with the case of the kepler-89 ( koi-94 ) system , where a small light - curve modulation led to the clear detection of a ppe @xcite , the situation is less ideal for the kepler-51 system analyzed in this paper .",
    "a detailed investigation of the possible phenomena ( e.g. , star spots ) that could produce ppe - like features would help the future detection of this valuable event in such marginal conditions .",
