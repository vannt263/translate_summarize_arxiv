    "_ fuse _ consists of four coaligned spectrographs .",
    "two employ al+lif optical coatings and record spectra over the wavelength range 9901187  , while the other two use sic coatings , which provide reflectivity to wavelengths below the lyman limit .",
    "the four channels overlap between 990 and 1070  .",
    "each channel possesses three apertures that simultaneously sample different parts of the sky . the low - resolution ( lwrs )",
    "aperture is 30  @xmath9 30  in size .",

    "_ , see @xcite and @xcite .    to identify background observations for this study , we searched the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) for _ fuse _ data obtained after 2005 january 1 falling in one of three categories : programs s405 , s505 , s605 , s705 , and s905 , which consist of background observations obtained during spacecraft thermalization periods ; mdrs , hirs , and rfpt observations of point sources , for which the lwrs aperture should sample only background sky ; and targets whose names include the strings `` bkg '' or `` sky . '' to find older observations that may have been missed in our previous studies , we searched the entire archive for target names that include the strings `` off , '' `` sky , '' or `` wind . ''",
    "we exclude from our sample known supernova remnants , nebulae , and point - source targets in either of the magellanic clouds .",

    "we use only data obtained in time - tag mode , which preserves arrival time and pulse - height information for each photon event . to avoid contamination by geocoronal emission @xcite",

    "individual exposures with less than 10 s of night exposure time are excluded from the survey , as are combined data sets with less than 1500 s of night exposure time or with significant continuum flux .",
    "our final sample consists of data obtained along 120 lines of sight .",
    "the data were reduced using an implementation of calfuse v3.2 , the latest version of the _ fuse _ data - reduction software package @xcite , optimized for faint , diffuse emission .",

    "background subtraction is turned off .",
    "zero - point errors in the wavelength scale are corrected by fitting a synthetic emission feature to the ly @xmath10 airglow line .",
    "the spectra from individual exposures are then shifted to a heliocentric wavelength scale and combined .",
    "we use an automated routine to search each combined spectrum for statistically significant emission near 1032  .",
    "when we find it , we fit the line with a model emission feature using the non - linear curve - fitting program specfit  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a top - hat shaped function 106 km s@xmath7  in width , representing the lwrs aperture , convolved with a gaussian , representing the instrument line - spread function ( @xmath11 25 km s@xmath7 ) convolved with the intrinsic emission - line profile .",
    "free parameters in the fit are the level and slope of the background ( assumed linear ) and the amplitude , central wavelength , and fwhm of the gaussian .",
    "while we use the same line identification and fitting algorithms described in , one change in our technique is worth noting : because our count rates are low , we bin the spectra to raise the counts per bin into the regime where gaussian statistics apply . for most spectra",
    ", we bin by 14 pixels or 53 km s@xmath7 , a value chosen so that that two binned pixels just span a diffuse emission feature . if the continuum averages more than 1.5 counts per pixel , we take advantage of the higher signal - to - noise ratio and bin by only 8 pixels . because narrow emission features may be undersampled by 14-pixel binning , in we lowered the threshold for 8-pixel binning to 0.5 counts per bin for spectra containing features with fwhm @xmath12 km s@xmath7 . in this paper",
    ", we use 14-pixel binning for all faint continua , regardless of the line width . implications of this change are discussed below .    our automated routine flags 32 spectra as having statistically significant  emission ;",
    "i.e. , the intensity of a putative emission feature is greater than 3 times the uncertainty in the local continuum . for only 13 of these spectra",
    "do model fits return line intensities with @xmath13 .",
    "we refer to these features as 3@xmath0  detections .",
    "lines with @xmath14 are referred to as 2@xmath0  detections .",
    "the best - fit parameters for both sets of  features are presented in table [ tab_detections ] , and plots of the spectra and best - fit models are presented in figures [ fig_3sigma ] and [ fig_2sigma ] .",
    "the asymmetric shapes of the narrowest model emission features are artifacts of our sparse sampling of the model lines .",
    "measured intensities range from 2.8 to 10.5 klu , with a median of 4.0 klu .",
    "five of our 3@xmath0  detections have local standard of rest velocities @xmath15 km s@xmath7 , while the rest have @xmath16 km s@xmath7 .",
    "four sight lines have fwhm values @xmath17",
    "km s@xmath7 , indicating that their  emission does not fill the lwrs aperture . for these sight lines ,",
    "the surface brightness of the emitting region is underestimated and the velocity uncertain , as discussed in . for the non - detection sight lines , we compute 3@xmath0  upper limits to the intensity of an  emission feature using the mean background intensity between 1030 and 1035   and assuming a line width of 28 pixels ( 106 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "upper limits for 15 sight lines with @xmath18 klu are given in table [ tab_limits ] .",
    "four of our sight lines are previously published , but we include them here because additional data are now available . the original 26 ks observation of sight line b12901 is analyzed by @xcite and in .",
    "recently , this line of sight was re - observed as target u10635 , increasing the total exposure time to 40 ks .",
    "for this line of sight , an upper limit of 1.5 klu is reported in ( see their table 6 ) ; our new upper limit is 1.2 klu .",
    "similarly , sight line c15301 was re - observed as target u10631 , increasing the total exposure time from 93 to 102 ks",
    ". our results ( table [ tab_detections ] ) are consistent with those of @xcite , who analyze the original c15301 data .",
    "a 5.2 ks observation of sight line s40577 was analyzed in , resulting in an upper limit of 3.6 klu ( see their table 4 ) .",
    "the total exposure time is now 24 ks , and our upper limit has fallen to 1.7 klu .    finally , a second observation of sight line s40590 has increased its exposure time from 10.8 to 15.2 ks .",
    "the measured flux is unchanged from that reported in , but the best - fit radial velocity has risen from @xmath19 to @xmath20 km s@xmath7 .",
    "part of this change may be attributed to the fact that , because the feature is so narrow , we binned the spectrum by 8 pixels in , while we bin it by 14 pixels for this paper .",
    "binning the current spectrum by 8 pixels yields a best - fit velocity of @xmath21 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the larger problem is that the emission feature , with fwhm = 9 km s@xmath7 , is unresolved , suggesting that the emitting region is smaller than the lwrs aperture .",
    "the uncertainty of its position within the aperture adds a systematic velocity uncertainty of about 50 km s@xmath7 .",
    "examination of tables [ tab_detections ] and [ tab_limits ] reveals that most of the  detection sight lines in our sample lie in the region of the southern galactic sky between @xmath22 = 180  and 360 , while most of our upper limits lie in the region of the northern galactic sky between @xmath22 = 0  and 180 .",
    "the prominence of these two quadrants in the _ fuse _ target list is discussed in and reflects observational constraints that reduced target availability in the orbit plane .",
    "the dearth of  detections among our northern sight lines may reflect their generally lower galactic latitudes , which are more likely to suffer significant extinction .",
    "happily , the southern quadrant between @xmath22 = 180  and 360  is now reasonably well sampled in  emission , and we focus our attention there .",

    "the other sight lines fall into two groups : those at latitudes @xmath25 , which suffer little reddening and whose intensities appear to fall with distance from the plane , and those with @xmath1 , which suffer significant reddening .",
    "a color excess of @xmath24 )  = 0.2 corresponds to an attenuation factor of 14 @xcite , so it is unlikely that much of the absorbing material lies between us and the emitting gas .",

    "k , thermal broadening would produce line widths of 40 km s@xmath7  ( after convolution with the _ fuse _ line - spread function ) , so the broad emission features , more common at high latitudes , sample either turbulent gas or multiple emitting regions spanning a range of velocities .",

    "the perimeters of these high - velocity  clouds , where cool and hot gas meet and mingle , are natural sites for the formation of intermediate - temperature -bearing gas . indeed , @xcite report  absorption along several extragalactic sight lines ( including fairall  9 ) that probe the magellanic stream at velocities consistent with that of the  gas .",
    "intriguingly , while both fairall  9 and ngc  625 show  absorption at magellanic velocities , neither shows high - velocity  emission .",
    "the interface region , which does show  emission , is unique in this respect .",
    "these are the first detections of high - ionization emission from the magellanic system outside of the clouds themselves .",
    "the  intensities observed along the two sight lines towards the edges of the interface region are well within the normal range observed in the diffuse ism , but the intensity along sight line s70504 ( 10.5 klu ) is significantly higher .",
    "in fact , it is the highest diffuse  intensity observed to date ( outside of supernova remnants , superbubbles , and high - ionization planetary nebulae ) . though the  emission feature in this spectrum is statistically significant , its exposure time is quite short , just over 2 ks .",
    "deeper and more detailed observations would help to determine whether such high intensities are commonly obtained in the interface region of the magellanic system .",
    "we present the final installment of the _ fuse _ survey of diffuse  emission in the interstellar medium .",
    "these observations reveal the large - scale structure of the -bearing gas in the quadrant of the sky centered on the magellanic clouds .",
    "its most prominent feature , a layer of low - velocity  emission extending more than 70  from the galactic plane , is produced by two distinct populations of emitting clouds . at latitudes @xmath1 , sight lines suffer significant extinction , suggesting that they probe relatively nearby emitting regions ; their emission features are more likely to be narrow or unresolved , suggesting single interfaces less than about 0.15 pc across ; and their velocities are generally consistent with galactic rotation .",
    "we identify these emitting regions with narrow , high - density interfaces in the local ism .    at latitudes",
    "@xmath25 , extinction is low .",
    "intensities fall with distance from the plane .",
    "emission features are generally broad , suggesting that they sample turbulent gas or multiple emitting regions spanning a range of velocities .",
    "the -bearing gas seems to be moving away from the galactic plane . for two sight lines , fairall  9 and ngc  625",
    ", we combine -emission and -absorption measurements to constrain the physical parameters of the emitting regions . from the resulting path lengths",
    ", we estimate that these regions lie at least 800 pc from the galactic plane .",
    "the presence of nearby sight lines yielding null detections but strong upper limits suggests that the emission is patchy , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "high - velocity  emission is seen along three sight lines that probe the interface region of the magellanic system .",
    "the  velocities are generally consistent with those of the underlying .",
    "high - velocity  emission is not seen in sight lines that probe the magellanic stream , suggesting that the dynamics of the interface region differ from those of the stream itself .",
    "these are the first detections of emission from high - ionization species in the magellanic system outside of the clouds themselves .",
