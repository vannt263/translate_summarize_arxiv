    "the formalism for the cross section of the elastic scattering of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) off nuclei , was formulated many years ago for the neutralino  @xcite , a well motivated supersymmetric dark matter candidate  @xcite .",

    "<S> the dominant , momentum independent , 2-body currents effect can be taken into account by formally redefining the static spin matrix elements @xmath2 . by further using the normalized form factor at @xmath3 built with the 1-body level structure functions , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the wimp - nucleus cross section and the upper limits on the wimp - nucleon cross sections coincide with the ones derived using the exact functions at the 2-body level . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly show it in the case of xenon100 limits on the wimp - neutron cross section and we recalculate the limits on the wimp - proton spin dependent cross section set by coupp . </S>",
    "<S> we also give practical formulas to obtain @xmath2 given the structure functions in the various formalisms / notations existing in literature . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the standard treatment of the spin - dependent cross section in terms of three independent isospin functions , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is redundant in the sense that the interference function @xmath6 is the double product @xmath7 even when including the new effective field theory corrections . </S>"
