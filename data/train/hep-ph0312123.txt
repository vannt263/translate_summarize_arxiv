    "recently the kek to kamioka long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ( k2k ) has published its first result @xcite , which confirms the existence of @xmath2 oscillation as seen in the super - kamiokande ( sk ) atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the observed oscillation parameters from k2k agree well with the neutrino mass and mixing angles deduced from the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data @xcite @xmath3    as is well known , in a two flavor scenario , the probability for a muon neutrino with energy @xmath4 to remain a muon neutrino after propagating the distance @xmath5 is given by the following expression @xmath6 basically , the standard approach to measure the oscillation parameters is to determine the oscillation probability in eq .   in dependence of @xmath4 . at the position of the minimum @xmath7",
    "can be determined from the condition @xmath8 and @xmath9 from @xmath10 .",
    "the neutrino energy is not directly measurable but can be reconstructed from the simple kinematics of quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering events . measuring the energy @xmath11 and",
    "the polar angle @xmath12 of the produced muon allows to reconstruct @xmath4 with help of the following relation ( even if the scattered proton is not observed ) @xmath13 =   \\frac{m e_\\mu - { \\ensuremath{m_{\\mu}}}^2/2}{m - e_\\mu + |\\vec{k}_\\mu| \\cos\\theta_\\mu } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : e - reconstruction}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 denotes the proton mass , @xmath15 the muon mass and @xmath16 is the three - momentum of the muon in the laboratory system",
    ".    however , in practice there are some difficulties .",
    "first of all , the experimental one - ring muon events ( @xmath17 ) are not pure qe event samples . about 30@xmath18 of the @xmath17 events are 1-pion production events with unidentified or absorbed pions . for the 1-pion events eq .   would systematically underestimate the true neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "secondly , the reconstruction of @xmath4 gets more complicated including binding energy @xmath19 and fermi motion of the target nucleons @xmath20 \\\\   & = & \\frac{(e_p+\\epsilon_b ) e_\\mu - ( 2 e_p \\epsilon_b + \\epsilon^2_b+ { \\ensuremath{m_{\\mu}}}^2)/2-\\vec{p}\\cdot \\vec{k}_\\mu } { e_p+\\epsilon_b - e_\\mu+|\\vec{k}_\\mu|\\cos\\theta_\\mu-|\\vec{p}|\\cos\\theta_p } \\ , \\nonumber \\label{eq : e - reconstruction1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the three momentum and @xmath22 the energy of the initial nucleon .",
    "further , @xmath23 is the polar angle of the target nucleon w.r.t .  the direction of the incoming neutrino . neglecting @xmath19 and the momentum @xmath24 eq .",
    "is recovered .",
    "since the momentum @xmath21 is unknown , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi momentum , this will lead to an uncertainty of the reconstructed neutrino energy at given values @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath19 of about -9@xmath18 to + 6@xmath18 for a single event .",
    "hence we can see no reliable way for reconstructing the neutrino energy for the @xmath17 sample on an event by event basis . on the other hand",
    "the muon energy is a directly measurable quantity for each event .",
    "therefore it seems to us to be a better variable for testing the spectral distortion phenomenon compared to the reconstructed neutrino energy .    in this",
    "talk we summarize the basic ideas and the main results in @xcite where we have used kinematic considerations to predict the muon energy spectra of the qe and 1-pion resonance production events which constitute the bulk of the charged - current @xmath2 scattering events in the k2k experiment .",
    "these predictions can be checked with the observed muon energy spectra from the nearby detector .",
    "we also present the distortion of these muon spectra due to @xmath2 oscillation , which one expects to see at the sk detector .",
    "comparison of the predicted muon spectra with those of the observed qe and 1-pion events at the sk detector will be very useful in determining the oscillation parameters .",
    "the flux averaged muon energy spectra for qe and 1-pion events are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the neutrino flux at k2k for the nearby detector(nd ) and r denotes qe and @xmath30 resonance contribution to 1-pion production , which dominates the latter .",
    "simple kinematic considerations lead to the following approximation for the flux averaged muon energy spectra , both , for qe and 1-pion production @xcite @xmath31 with @xmath32 furthermore , it is well known that the total cross sections for qe and @xmath30 production tend to constant values for neutrino energies of about @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively : @xmath35 \\to n^r$ ] . hence , for muon energies larger than about @xmath36 , eq .",
    "can be further simplified by replacing @xmath37 by its constant asymptotic value @xmath38 : @xmath39 with @xmath40 the normalizations correspond to the average cross - section per nucleon for a @xmath41 target @xcite .    thus we conclude that at large muon energies @xmath42 the flux averaged muon energy cross section @xmath43 is directly proportional to the neutrino flux shifted in energy .",
    "the normalizations @xmath38 and energy shifts @xmath44 are predictions of our theoretical calculation @xcite which can be verified experimentally with the muon energy spectra of the qe and 1-pion events observed at the nd .",
    "furthermore , eqs .  , , and",
    "also apply to the far detector ( fd ) if one replaces the flux at the nd by the flux at the fd which is distorted by the neutrino oscillation probability @xmath45 : @xmath46 comparing these predictions with the observed muon energy spectra of the qe and 1-pion events of the sk detector will test the spectral distortion due to @xmath2 oscillation and determine the oscillation parameters .",
    "particularly , on the higher energy side of the peak the relative size of the sk to the nd cross - sections provides a direct measure of the spectral distortion and hence the underlying oscillation parameters : @xmath47    in sec .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] we present exact calculations of the qe @xcite and 1-pion production cross sections .",
    "the dominant contribution to 1-pion production is from @xmath30 resonance production for which we take the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    "we have also included the @xmath48 and @xmath49 resonance contributions for which we used the parameterization and the form factors of ref .",
    "we estimate the contribution from the still higher resonances along with the non - resonant background to be no more than @xmath50 of the 1-pion production cross section at these low energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "therefore the accuracy of our prediction should be as good as that of the k2k experiment .",
    "we compare our exact calculations with the approximation in eqs .   and",
    "from which the range of validity can be inferred . a comparison with the approximation in eq .",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "we also show for comparison as dotted line the same lorentzian , but with normalization 1.4 instead of 1.25.,width=321 ]    in this section we present our numerical results .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the k2k neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , we show an approximated spectrum by a lorentzian given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an appropriate normalization factor .",

    "[ fig:2]a shows the predicted muon energy spectra for the qe ( solid line ) and 1-pion production ( dashed line ) processes .",
    "clearly one can see that the peak at @xmath53 is shifted left by @xmath54 for the qe and @xmath55 for the @xmath30 resonance production which dominates the 1-pion production process .",
    "the steepness of the muon energy spectra at the low energy reflects the threshold rise of @xmath56 and the steep neutrino flux . on the other hand the muon energy spectra",
    "closely follow the shape of the neutrino energy spectrum on the right side of the peak .",
    "the predicted exact muon energy spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a agree reasonably well with the corresponding spectra of the k2k nd  @xcite for both the qe and the non - qe sample .",
    "in particular one can compare the predicted qe spectrum with their simulated qe spectrum shown in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite . their figs .",
    "1a and c show separately the qe muon momentum distribution for the 1-ring muon ( @xmath17 ) sample of the 1kt and the qe enhanced sample of the fgd respectively .",
    "the two play complementary roles in covering the complete muon energy range , as the 1kt and the fgd have high efficiencies at @xmath57 and @xmath42 , respectively @xcite .",
    "one can not compare our predicted muon energy spectra with these figures quantitatively without folding in these efficiency factors , which are not available to us .",
    "but there is good qualitative agreement between the predicted qe spectrum of our fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a with their fig .",
    "1c at @xmath42 and fig .",
    "1a at @xmath57 .",
    "while the former shows the position of the peak and the shape of the spectrum to the right , the latter shows the broadening of spectrum down to @xmath58 .",
    "similarly one sees good agreement between the predicted muon energy spectrum of our fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a for 1-pion events with the non - qe spectra of their fig .",
    "1c , d at @xmath42 and fig .",
    "1a at @xmath57 .",
    "thus one has a simple and robust prediction for the shape of the muon energy spectrum in terms of the neutrino spectrum not only for the qe events but also for the 1-pion production events , which dominate the inelastic events .",
    "[ fig:2]b shows the corresponding muon energy spectra of the qe and 1-pion events for the sk detector , predicted by eqs .   and .",
    "one can clearly see the distortion of the muon energy spectrum due the @xmath2 oscillation .",
    "they should be compared with the observed muon energy spectra of the 1-ring and 2-ring muon events at the sk detector , after taking into account the pion detection efficiency .",
    "we hope such a comparison will be done by the k2k collaboration .    for the estimation of the pion detection efficiency it is necessary to consider nuclear effects , i.e. , pauli blocking , nuclear absorption and charge exchange of the produced pions which can rescatter several times in the nucleus .",
    "therefore we have included these effects following the prescription of refs .  @xcite .",
    "since the dominant contribution to 1-pion production processes comes from @xmath30 resonance production on oxygen , we have evaluated the effects of nuclear absorption and rescattering on the produced pions for this case .",
    "the relevant charged current subprocesses are @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 with relative cross - sections @xmath62 for the dominant contribution from @xmath30 resonance .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the effects of nuclear corrections on the produced @xmath63 and @xmath64 spectra from these processes for the nearby detector averaged over the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the results are very similar for the sk detector .",
    "nuclear rescattering effects result in enhancing the @xmath64 events at the cost of the dominant @xmath63 component . but taken together we see a nearly @xmath65 drop in the rate of 1-pion events due to nuclear absorption of the produced pion .",
    "moreover about @xmath66 of the remaining events corresponds to the pion momentum being less than the cerenkov threshold of @xmath67 .",
    "therefore one expects about @xmath68 of the @xmath30 events to give a detectable pion ring at the sk detector while the remaining @xmath69 appears like a qe event . adding the latter to the @xmath70 of genuine qe events",
    "would imply that about @xmath71 of the cc events will appear qe - like at the sk detector .",
    "alternatively the observed muon energy spectrum of the sum of 1-ring and 2-ring muon events could be compared with the predicted spectrum of the sum of qe and 1-pion events .",
    "although a part of the 2-ring events may come from multi - pion production , the resulting error may be small since multi - pion events at the nd constitute only @xmath72 of cc events .",
    "next , we turn in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] to a comparison of the exact calculation for the muon energy spectra ( solid lines ) with the approximation ( dashed lines ) made on the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "[ fig:3]a shows the results for the nd and fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b for the fd obtained with the neutrino flux specified in eq .  .",
    "one can see that the approximation is in perfect agreement with the exact calculation for muon energies @xmath73 for single pion production and @xmath74 for qe scattering .",
    "hence , in this region the muon energy spectra are directly proportional to the neutrino flux shifted in energy .         finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig:4]a and [ fig:4]b we show the far - near - ratio of the muon energy spectra for qe and 1-pion production , respectively . in this case , the dashed lines depict the exact result and the solid lines the oscillation probabilities @xmath75 given in eq .   which have been evaluated at the shifted energies @xmath76 given in eq .",
    "again , at @xmath74 ( qe ) and @xmath73 ( 1-pion production ) the approximation in eqs .   and works well and a measurement of the far - near - ratio of such pure qe or 1-pion event samples in this kinematic region would give direct access to the oscillation probability .",
    "however , as has been discussed above , the observable 1-ring and 2-ring muon events are superpositions of qe , 1-pion , and multi - pion events making the analysis more complicated .",
    "the muon energy spectra of qe and 1-pion events provide a complementary approach to experimental extractions of the atmospheric muon oscillation parameters at k2k .",
    "the results are based on quite general kinematic considerations and will also be applicable to other future long baseline experiments like j2k , minos and the cern - gran sasso experiments which plan to use low energy @xmath2 beams @xcite",
    ". therefore it will be very useful to extend this analysis for the beam energy spectra and the target nuclei of these experiments ."
