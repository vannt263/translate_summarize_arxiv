    "considering for instance a value of @xmath30 does not necessarily means that we are dealing with a dark energy fluid that behaves like dark matter but it might be due to a particular modified gravity model expressed in terms of fluid parameters which has a value of @xmath24 equal to zero ( or very small ) , see @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the eq .",
    "( [ geffde ] ) has been evaluated under the condition of constant in time sound speed , however the sound speed can depend on the scale .",

    "<S> we present the analytical solutions for the evolution of matter density perturbations , for a model with a constant dark energy equation of state @xmath0 but when the effects of the dark energy perturbations are properly taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two cases , the first when the sound speed of the perturbations is zero @xmath1 and the general case @xmath2 . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> our solution is exact , while in the second case we found an approximate solution which works to better than @xmath3 accuracy for @xmath4 or equivalently @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the corrections to the growth index @xmath6 , commonly used to parametrize the growth - rate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these corrections due to the de perturbations affect the growth index @xmath7 at the @xmath8 level . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our new expressions for the growth index with other expressions already present in the literature and we find that the latter are less accurate than the ones we propose here . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our analytical calculations are necessary as the theoretical predictions for the fundamental parameters to be constrained by the upcoming surveys need to be as accurate as possible , especially since we are entering in the precise cosmology era where parameters will be measured to the percent level . </S>"
