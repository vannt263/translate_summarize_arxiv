    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite confirming the existence of at least two non - vanishing neutrino mass - squared differences necessitates physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in principle , neutrino mass could be simply generated by addition of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos through the higgs mechanism , but to get neutrino masses less than @xmath14 ev , the neutrino yukawa coupling has to be extremely small @xmath15 .",
    "hence alternate mechanisms for neutrino mass have been proposed . among these the seesaw mechanism  @xcite",
    "provides a natural explanation of the smallness of neutrino mass .",
    "the simplest realization of the seesaw , the so - called type - i seesaw , requires the existence of a set of heavy electroweak singlet ( sterile ) lepton number violating ( lnv ) majorana fermions , n. a typical scale for the majorana mass @xmath16 in grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite is of the order of the gut scale , but in general , in various other scenarios , sterile neutrinos can lie in a wide range of masses .",
    "in particular , in low energy seesaw models  @xcite sterile neutrinos may have mass between @xmath17 mev to few gev .",
    "sterile neutrinos have also been invoked to explain the lsnd  @xcite , miniboone  @xcite and reactor  @xcite anomalies .",
    "a viable dark matter candidate is a kev sterile neutrino  @xcite .",
    "other astrophysical observations including supernovae permit sterile neutrinos mixed with active ones . while cosmological / astrophysical constraints on sterile neutrinos are strong , they are model dependent and hence laboratory searches and constraints on sterile neutrinos , particularly majorana sterile neutrinos are rather important .",
    "sterile neutrinos have been searched for in the laboratory through peak searches in leptonic decays of pions and kaons  @xcite .",
    "the lepton spectrum would show a monochromatic line at a lower energy in presence of a heavy neutrino .",
    "these have provided tight constraints on the mixing angle of the sterile neutrino with the active ones .",
    "heavy neutrinos have also been looked for through searches of their visible decay products .",
    "searches for sterile neutrinos including majorana sterile neutrinos need to be performed at all possible scales , as their discovery may provide hints of the new physics responsible for neutrino mass generation .",
    "one of the promising processes to explore majorana neutrinos is through neutrinoless double beta decay which may be experimentally feasible due to the large samples of the decaying nuclei , however , on the theoretical side this involves large uncertainties coming from the nuclear matrix elements making it harder to extract information on neutrino properties .",
    "the rare lnv meson and tau decays can be more accurately evaluated  @xcite and although their decay rates may be extremely small , they may be accessible with current and future high luminosity machines . in the last decade or so",
    ", many experimental collaborations , cleo  @xcite , focus  @xcite , babar  @xcite , belle and more recently lhcb  @xcite , have searched for such lnv processes . on the theoretical and phenomenological side as well , considerable effort has been made in proposing possible modes that could probe sm singlet majorana neutrinos in various mass ranges and constrain their mixing parameters .",
    "this includes proposals to search for heavier neutrinos at accelerator and collider experiments such as , @xmath18  @xcite , @xmath19  @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite , @xmath22  @xcite , as well as in top quark and w - boson rare decays  @xcite .",
    "while various @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 meson decay modes have already been suggested , here we propose a few additional @xmath3 decay modes that may perhaps be preferable for majorana neutrino searches .",
    "the @xmath24 mesons are unique , in being the only states consisting of two heavy quarks of different flavours ( @xmath25 for @xmath26 ) .",
    "the weak decay of the b quark will be cabibbo suppressed , for both @xmath27 , ( @xmath28 suppressed ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 suppressed ) transitions . however , for the @xmath31 decay , it will be a cabibbo favoured transition .",
    "hence , the mode @xmath5 is expected to have a larger branching fraction than the other rare lepton number violating decay modes of bottom mesons considered so far .",
    "further , for a heavy neutrino in the mass range @xmath32 , it is kinematically possible for it to be produced as an intermediate on mass shell state , resulting in an additional resonance enhancement of the transition rate .",
    "the @xmath33 mode has already been observed by lhcb  @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 decays to other hadronic modes have also been observed by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , hence in addition to lhcb , atlas and cms may also be able to perform the search for majorana neutrinos via this @xmath3 decay mode . in the proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider ,",
    "@xmath3 mesons are expected to be mainly produced through the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "hence , the production cross - section would be expected to increase in the @xmath35 tev run substantially .",
    "this , along with the luminosity of the order of few @xmath36 in run ii , leads one to believe that searches for this rare lnv @xmath3 decay modes may be feasible .    in the next section ,",
    "we give the formalism for the extension of the sm to include right handed singlets . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , the four - body decay rate for @xmath5 mode is evaluated and the expected upper limits on branching ratios for these modes are used to obtain bounds on the mixings of the heavy neutrino with the light flavoured ones . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] , the modes @xmath6 and @xmath37 are discussed .",
    "we find that although these modes are not cabibbo favoured , but the ease of reconstruction of the final states for these modes results in tighter possible upper limits for the branching fractions and in addition the phase space enhancement helps in obtaining tighter exclusion curves for the mixing elements . finally in sec .",

    "for the four - body decay @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , only s - channel diagrams shown in fig.[feynmandiagram ] contribute .",
    "hence , the majorana neutrino n that induces this lnv process can appear as an intermediate on mass shell state , leading to an enhancement of the decay rate .",
    "note that the second diagram(fig.[feynmandiagram](b ) ) arises from the exchange of the two leptons .",
    "we assume that there is only one majorana neutrino , that lies in the range , between @xmath53 that kinematically allows it to be on mass shell .",
    "moreover , being much heavier than the active light neutrinos , the cosmological and lep bounds would imply that such a neutrino would have to be necessarily an electroweak gauge singlet or sterile .",

    "the above two hadronic matrix elements can be written as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) are the momentum transfer squared dependent @xmath26 to @xmath66 transition form factors and @xmath67 is the decay constant of pion . in terms of these form factors and",

    "it is claimed in  @xcite that these variations result in @xmath76 . to avoid this theoretical uncertainty and model dependence in the form factors , we recommend that the form factors should be determined experimentally by measurement of the semileptonic mode , @xmath77 .",
    "alternately , perhaps lattice estimation of the form factors may also be possible .",
    "although the heavy sterile neutrino n is a sm singlet , it can decay via charged current and neutral current interactions , due to its mixing with the active neutrinos as is evident from the lagrangian  ( [ interaction lagrangian ] ) .",

    "even if these decay modes are not seen , one may naively estimate that it may be possible to set upper limits on the branching ratios of @xmath207 .",
    "however , since the final @xmath23 meson needs to be reconstructed via its prominant decay modes , either @xmath208 or @xmath209 , with @xmath210 ; @xmath211 , upper limits on @xmath212 of only @xmath213 may be feasible .",

    "[ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] , we show the exclusion curves corresponding to the constraints on the mixing angles @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath214 given in eqn.([analytical4 ] ) , for possible upper limits on the @xmath193 @xmath215 , of @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "rather loose constraints are obtained if no assumptions regarding the mixing elements @xmath136 are made and if the maximum values of these mixing elements permitted by unitarity and global fits to oscillation data ( obtained in eqn.([oscillation bound ] ) ) are used in @xmath59 evaluation .",
    "this results in the upper limits on the mixing elements displayed in the right panels of the figs .

    "@xmath215 @xmath219 , the bounds on the mixing angles obtained for @xmath220 , are slightly tighter than those from other heavy meson decays considered in @xcite . only the constraints from @xmath221 meson visible 3-body decays are tighter , but for the mass range of @xmath222 , our exclusion limits are either tighter or compatible with the earlier constraints .",
    "a comparison of our exclusion plots against that shown in a recent analysis on global constraints on a heavy neutrino  @xcite , again shows that these bounds could provide very tight constraints in a small range of @xmath16 , beyond that excluded only by peak searches in @xmath221 meson decays , which is otherwise so far unconstrained .",
    "the reasons for this improved sensitivity are that the meson decay modes considered in the literature so far have been mostly 3-body decay modes involving the annihilation of the initial meson and the weak annihilation vertex of all heavy mesons ( except @xmath223 ) suffers from cabibbo suppression .",
    "this reduces the coefficient of the mixing elements in the decay rates , resulting in looser constraints .",
    "hence , in spite of the mild phase space suppression this 4-body mode can result in improved exclusion limits for the mixing angles of the heavy majorana neutrino with the light flavour neutrinos . with a larger sample of @xmath3 events , possible at future high energy colliders , much stronger upper limits on the branching ratios would be possible , which would result in more stringent constraints on the mixing elements .",
    "although the modes @xmath50 , are expected to have a larger branching ratios due to the cabibbo enhancement , however , as pointed out in the last section , the reconstruction of the @xmath66 results in a penalty of @xmath224 , implying that with the limited number @xmath3 events at lhcb even in the @xmath205 run , upper limits on the branching ratios for these modes , smaller than @xmath217 may not be feasible .",

    "the @xmath263 quark decays are always cabibbo suppressed , with @xmath265 or @xmath266 suppression for @xmath267 or @xmath268 transitions respectively .",
    "the charm quark decay on the other hand can be cabibbo favoured .",
    "hence the amplitude for @xmath50 , ( @xmath269 ) decays can be enhanced .",
    "these four - body decay modes involve transition form factors rather than decay constants that appear in case of annihilation of the decaying meson , as is the case for the 3-body meson decays extensively studied for majorana neutrino searches in the literature . to avoid model dependence and theoretical uncertainties",
    ", we suggest that these form factors be measured using the semileptonic mode , @xmath270 . for a majorana neutrino that lies in the mass range that allows it to be on the mass shell ,",
    "there is also a resonant enhancement of the process .",
    "a search for majorana neutrinos via these rare modes which are expected to have larger branching fractions , appears more feasible .",
    "even a non - observation can result in exclusion curves for the mixing angles of the heavy majorana singlet with the flavour eigenstates , corresponding to possible upper limits for the branching fractions .",
    "these constriants are mostly tighter than those obtained from other heavy meson decay modes in earlier studies and the mass range probed lies beyond the range with stringent constraints from experimental bounds on three - body kaon lnv decays .    in spite of the cabibbo enhancement for the @xmath5 modes ,",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath23 leads one to expect less stringent upper limits for these modes compared to that for @xmath6 modes where the @xmath110 can be reconstructed more easily via the @xmath271 mode .",
    "similarly the reconstruction of the @xmath37 mode would be less demanding",
    ". this along with the phase space enhancement of the latter two modes may result in much tighter ( by almost an order of magnitude ) exclusion curves for the mixing elements , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "further , for @xmath243 , on which bounds exist only from tau decays , exclusion curves for masses upto about @xmath272 can be provided .",
    "also , upper limits for @xmath13 can be obtained in the mass range @xmath273 , where it is so far unconstrained .",
    "thanks vanya belyaev for communication regarding the expected @xmath3 production cross - section at lhcb in the @xmath205 run .",
    "the authors thank patrick koppenburg for his valuable inputs and suggestions and appreciate comments from andrew kobach , g. lpez castro , v.v .",
    "kiselev , sandip pakvasa and n.g . deshpande .",
    "to describe the kinematics of four - body decays , five independent variables are required .",
    "we choose the independent variables to be , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath109 , which for the processes , @xmath276 or @xmath277 are defined as : @xmath278 @xmath109 is the angle between the normals to the planes defined in the @xmath24 rest frame by the @xmath279 pair and the @xmath167 pair .",
    "the ranges of the angular variables are @xmath280 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 .       to evaluate the decay rate for the 4-body lnv @xmath50 mode , the mod squared of the matrix element specified in eqn .",

    "<S> recently , the lhcb collaboration reported the observation of the decay mode @xmath0 with the largest exclusive branching fraction amongst the known decay modes of all the @xmath1 mesons . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a search for a few lepton - number violating ( @xmath2 ) decay modes of @xmath3 which can only be induced by majorana neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> distinguishing between dirac and majorana nature of neutrinos is an outstanding problem and hence , all possible searches for majorana neutrinos need to be carried out . since the lepton number violating modes </S>",
    "<S> are expected to be rare , when using meson decay modes for these searches one expects ckm favoured modes to be the preferred ones ; @xmath4 is one such transition . with a resonance enhancement of the majorana neutrino mediating the @xmath5 modes </S>",
    "<S> one can hope to observe these rare modes , or , even their non - observation can be used to obtain tight constraints on the mixing angles of the heavy majorana singlet with the light flavour neutrinos from upper limits of the branching fractions . using these modes we obtain exclusion curves for the mixing angles which are tighter or compatible with results from earlier studies . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the relatively suppressed mode @xmath6 can provide even tighter constraints on @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and in a larger range of the heavy neutrino mass . further , exclusion regions for @xmath10 , @xmath11 can also be obtained for masses larger than those accessible in tau decays . </S>",
    "<S> upper limits on @xmath12 can also result in stringent exclusion curves for all the mixing elements , including that for @xmath13 in a mass range where it is unconstrained thus far . </S>"
