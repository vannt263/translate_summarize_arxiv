    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are a common state of evolved compact binary systems .",
    "such systems consist of a main - sequence , sub - giant or brown dwarf star that is filling its roche lobe and transferring mass onto a white dwarf ( warner 2003 ) .",
    "the accretion process can be either directly onto a strongly magnetic white dwarf or by way of an intervening accretion disc .",
    "many cv systems with accretion discs undergo thermal instabilities within their discs ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ) that give rise to outbursts of up to eight magnitudes , and make up the cv sub - class termed dwarf novae ( e.g. patterson et al .",
    "1981 ; howell et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these outbursting events in dwarf novae - type cvs can last from days to weeks ( e.g. szkody & mattel 1984 ) .",
    "apart from their role in binary star evolution , understanding such systems is important for cosmology , since cvs remain possible progenitors to type - ia supernovae explosions ( patat et al .  2007",
    "; kafka et al .",
    "2012 ; immer et al .",
    "2006 ; zorotovic et al .",
    "2011 ) .    historically , the discovery of dwarf nova type cvs has been in large part due to serendipitous detection and subsequent follow - up studies ( gnsicke 2005 ) . more recently",
    ", confirmation of dwarf nova candidates has been undertaken routinely by a large network of small telescopes ( kato et al .",
    "the discovery of these systems is aided by the large intrinsic variations of the sources .",
    "however , the lack of deep synoptic wide - field surveys has meant that most historical cv discoveries have been , either relatively bright nearby cv systems , or fainter systems undergoing very large outbursts .",
    "an exception to this discovery method has been the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which undertook a spectroscopic survey of more than a hundred thousand qso targets ( schneider et al .",
    "2010 ; paris et al .",
    "2012 ) . due to the similar optical colours of qsos and cvs , besides large numbers of qsos , a few hundred cvs were discovered ( szkody et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "since these cv systems were identified from quiescent spectra rather than optical variation , this survey presented an unprecedented insight into the variety of system properties within the cv population , and led to the firm detection of the predicted accumulation of cvs near the orbital period minimum ( gnsicke et al .",
    "however , as spectroscopic observations require more flux than photometry , the sdss cv sample was limited to sources with @xmath1 ( although later work followed some targets as faint as @xmath2 ; richards et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the fact that dwarf novae brighten by many magnitudes during their outbursts enables the discovery of cv systems that are very faint in quiescence",
    ". however , intrinsically faint systems have lower accretion rates and less frequent outbursts compared to bright sources , thus introducing a bias in variability - based searches ( wils et al .",
    "2010 ) . to find large numbers of the faintest cv systems ,",
    "it is necessary to repeatedly survey large areas of the sky .",
    "a number of surveys have begun to systematically explore the astronomical time domain in order to discover optical transient events , such as cv outbursts .",
    "these projects include the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; drake et al .",
    "2009a , djorgovski et al . 2011 ) , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( panstarrs ; hodapp et al .  2004 ) , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; law et al .  2009 ) and the la silla quest survey ( lsq ; rabinowitz et al .  2011 ) .",
    "all these surveys are capable of discovering hundreds of intrinsically faint cvs during outbursts .",
    "however , only crts openly reports the discovery of cvs .",
    "future surveys such as skymapper ( keller et al .",
    "2007 ) , gaia ( perryman et al .  2001 ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; ivezic et al .",
    "2008 ) are also expected to detect numerous cvs .    in this paper",
    "we describe the cv systems that were detected by crts in data taken by the catalina sky survey between 2007 november 8th and 2012 july 31st .",
    "we will then investigate the basic properties of these systems and outline areas where additional work is required to better understand their nature .",
    "the catalina sky survey began in 2004 and uses three telescopes to repeatedly survey the sky between declination @xmath3 and + 65 degrees in search of near - earth objects ( neos ) and potential hazardous asteroids ( phas ) .",
    "in addition to asteroids , all the catalina data is analyzed for transient sources by crts ( drake et al .",
    "2009a ; djorgovski et al 2011 ) .",
    "each of the survey telescopes is run as separate sub - surveys .",
    "these consist of the catalina schmidt survey ( css ) , the mount lemmon survey ( mls ) and the siding spring survey ( sss ) . in this paper",
    "we analyse data taken by all three telescopes , namely the 0.7 m css telescope and the 1.5 m mls telescope in tucson , az and the 0.5 m ( sss ) uppsala schmidt at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "transient processing of css data by crts began on 2007 november 8th , while for mls data it began on 2009 november 6th , and for sss on 2010 may 5th .",
    "each telescope currently has a @xmath4 ccd camera , which for the css , mls and sss cover 8.2 , 1.1 and 4 square degrees , respectively . in general",
    "each telescope avoids the galactic latitudes less than 10 to 15 degrees due to reduced source recovery in crowded stellar regions .",
    "because of its smaller field - of - view the mls 1.5 m telescope predominately observes only ecliptic latitudes @xmath5 , whereas the css covers @xmath6 and the sss mainly covers @xmath7 . in total , @xmath8 30,000 @xmath9 of the sky",
    "are surveyed by the three telescopes .",
    "observations are taken during the darkest 21 nights per lunation in sets of four images each separated by 10 minutes .",
    "exposures typically last for 30 seconds .",
    "all images are taken unfiltered to maximize throughput .",
    "photometry is carried out using the aperture photometry program sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and is transformed to @xmath10 using standard stars as noted by drake et al .",
    "the crts project is aimed at the discovery of astrophysical sources such as cvs and supernovae that undergo transient brightness variations .",
    "details of the transient detection procedures in crts are given by drake et al .",
    "( 2009a ) . in short ,",
    "transient sources are identified by comparing them with detections in past photometric catalogues including css , usno ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) and sdss dr8 ( aihara et al . 2011 ) . for selection as a transient",
    ", an object must be a point source .",
    "it also must either not be present in previous catalogs , or be present and have varied with a high significance .",
    "objects detected within archival catalogues qualify as transients in crts when they increase in brightness by at least three times the observed scatter at the source brightness provided there is a minimum increase of 0.65 magnitudes .",
    "transient sources must be present in at least three of the four observations within a set of observations .",
    "the 0.65 mag threshold is a significant change from drake et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , and was adopted after careful consideration of transient discoveries and the variations of common periodic variable stars .",
    "for example , almost all of the rr lyrae detected by drake et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in catalina data vary by less than 1.3 magnitudes peak - to - peak .",
    "therefore , they generally fall below the 0.65 magnitude threshold when compared to their median magnitudes . among the @xmath11 transient sources discovered by crts before july 2012 , only a couple of dozen periodic variable stars ( mainly halo lpvs ) have met the transient detection criterion , thereby demonstrating that this threshold is effective in both removing periodically variable stars as well as catching low - amplitude transients .",
    "in addition to the variability threshold , transient selection requires a number of filters to remove artifacts and artificial variations .",
    "additional filters are run on the images containing transient candidates to remove objects that are detected as transients , but were missing from the input catalogs due to source blending and bad image data . moving objects such as asteroids and comets",
    "are analysed by the css neo survey and are removed based on known minor planet center sources as well as based on any motion over the 30 minutes between sets of four observations .",
    "transient candidates are also compared with sources from archival data from the sdss , the digital sky survey ( dss ) , and the palomar - quest ( pq ) survey in order to classify the sources and remove any possible remaining artifacts .",
    "all the transient candidates that pass the filtering stages are visually inspected and classified using their lightcurves along with information from archival surveys .    in the case of cv transients , there are a number of factors that can affect the detection sensitivity in various ways .",
    "for example , the efficiency of detecting frequently outbursting cvs is lower than one might expect .",
    "this is because objects that were in outburst in the comparison catalogs can not reach the detection threshold .",
    "many of the cvs detected by wils et al .",
    "( 2010 ) were in outburst in usno data and thus would not meet our transient criteria .",
    "furthermore , bright cvs may become saturated during outburst and go undetected , while in contrast , cvs with faint quiescent magnitudes can only be detected during very large outbursts .",
    "among the @xmath8 6,200 crts transient sources detected before 2012 july 31st , 1062 were identified as cv candidates . the classification",
    "as cv candidate relies on several different lines of evidence .",
    "transients that exhibited outbursts in prior css , pq , dss or other archival sources were deemed to be very good cv candidates and so were objects with blue psf - like counterparts in sdss or galex photometry ( provided there was no radio flux present ) .",
    "the presence of photometric variations in follow - up data and balmer emission lines in spectroscopic observations was also used to classify some of the systems as good cv candidates .",
    "in contrast , if no prior outburst was seen , or the colour and extent of the quiescent source was unclear , the transient source was deemed ambiguous .",
    "these objects are rejected from our sample of cv candidates .",
    "this selection excludes 235 sources with significant outbursts , but no additional evidence that they were cvs .",
    "the remaining 855 objects are hereafter identified as good cv candidates . among these sources ,",
    "150 systems were known to be cvs prior to their detection by crts .",
    "ongoing photometric and spectroscopic follow - up of crts cv candidates suggests that our selection process has @xmath12 accuracy at identifying cv systems ( eg .",

    "the absolute magnitudes of cvs are well known to vary significantly with their orbital periods .",
    "short - period cvs typically have @xmath23 in quiescence and @xmath24 in outburst ( warner et al .",
    "however , recent determinations of distances suggest that quiescent magnitudes near the period minimum can be much fainter , at @xmath25 ( gnsicke et al .",
    "2009 ) , or perhaps even as faint as @xmath26 ( sproats et al .",
    "1996 ) , and it is those type of systems which are likely to dominated the galactic cv population . in contrast , the determinations of cv outburst absolute magnitudes have remained relatively consistent with the values predicted by warner ( 1987 ) ( eg .",
    "thorstensen 2003 , harrison et al .",
    "the outburst absolute magnitudes are much better constrained than those in quiescence since the accretion disc completely dominates the emission during outburst . the brightness scales with the physical size of the disc , which itself scales with the orbital period . as the majority of crts cvs",

    "the agreement between distances derived from crts outburst magnitudes and sdss quiescent magnitudes ( assuming @xmath28 ) is very good .",

    "( 2009 ) , the scale height is reduced to 420pc .",
    "this value is still significantly larger than most values derived for the galactic thin disc ( eg .",
    "gould et al .",
    "1997 ; chen et al .",
    "2001 ) , but consistent with some results ( eg .",
    "nelson et al .  2002 ) .    considering the survey",
    "is largely limited to sources with @xmath30 , the faintest crts cvs are preferentially found at greater scale heights .",
    "nevertheless , even with this bias there should be few thin disc sources beyond three times the scale height .",
    "however , we note that the distances derived using quiescent absolute magnitudes are clearly inconsistent with the distances derived from outburst magnitudes . both sets of distances are inconsistent with cvs coming from a population with a scale height of 190pc , as found by patterson  ( 1984 ) .",
    "this result is not surprising since the patterson  ( 1984 ) sample is based on nearby cvs .",
    "only recent all - sky surveys are deep and wide enough to probe cv systems at thick disc distances .",
    "more recently , pretorius et al .",
    "( 2007 ) considered a number of models of the cv distribution within the galaxy and suggested that , given the different ages of the components of the galaxy , the scale heights of cvs should depend on their age , and hence on their orbital period . from their model",
    "_ a1 _ they found that cvs with @xmath31 would be strongly concentrated toward the period minimum when sources with @xmath32 were considered .",
    "the crts period distribution appears consistent with this model .",
    "pretorius et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also suggest that the flux - limited samples available at that time were not deep enough to reproduce the intrinsic population cvs , and thus that any comparison between the observed population and true population had to remain difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the determination of the spatial density of cvs is an important means for understanding cv evolution . in a future paper",
    "we shall address this question for cvs detected by crts ( breedt et al .",
    "in this work we have cataloged 855 cv candidates detected by crts . of these",
    "705 are new discoveries and at least 137 are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "these sources were primarily selected among crts optical transient sources using information about prior outbursts and their amplitudes , combined with archival information such as optical colours , and the presence of radio and x - ray sources .",
    "we have investigated the resulting outburst amplitude and colour distributions and confirm the expected differences from other common types of optical transients ( such as supernovae and blazars ) .",
    "we find that the crts cv sample extends two magnitudes deeper compared to the cvs that were spectroscopically identified by sdss ( szkody 2002 - 2011 ) .",
    "in contrast to the recent work on quantifying the cv population based on crts data by thorstensen & skinner ( 2012 ) , our analysis includes the additional cvs discovered using mls and sss telescopes , as well as more accurate details of the crts cv detection and classification . nevertheless , given that only 45% of the crts cvs have been detected in outburst more than once , we agree with the suggestion of thorstensen & skinner ( 2012 ) that a large fraction of the galactic cv population must remain to be discovered .    while it is clear that the galactic latitude limits of the catalina survey ( @xmath30 ) create a bias towards sources at large scale heights , the absolute magnitudes predicted from cv outbursts suggest a significant fraction of the cvs discovered have scale heights well beyond that expected for the galactic thin disc .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that many of the crts cvs belong to a thick disc population .    since crts detects cvs by searching for optical transient sources , this inherently biases the detections toward dwarf nova systems . to better understand the cv population we identified candidates that coincide with hard sources from x - ray catalogs .",
    "we find that most of the cv systems with x - ray matches appear to be non - magnetic systems .",
    "nevertheless , crts has discovered both eclipsing systems and magnetic cvs .",
    "it is likely that more magnetic cvs remain to be identified .    by analysing the orbital periods of the cvs , we find that the period distribution of crts cvs includes a much more significant contribution from short - period systems compared to the bulk of the previously known cvs , which are , on average , both brighter , and have more frequent outbursts .",
    "this result is in agreement with prior analyses by wils et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and woudt et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and also with the work by gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2009 ) based on sdss cvs , and uemura et al .",
    "( 2010 ) on wz sge stars .",
    "this underlines that new cv samples that have much deeper limiting magnitudes probe a different population of systems compared to the previously discovered bright cvs .",
    "however , in contrast to the orbital period distribution , we find no evidence for a difference in the outburst rates of the dwarf nova cvs .",
    "recent work on cvs from crts and other synoptic surveys has led to the discovery of a number of ultra - short - period cvs .",
    "these have been identified as am cvn types ( eg .",

    "2012 ) , or have substellar companions ( eg .",

    "<S> we present 855 cataclysmic variable candidates detected by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) of which at least 137 have been spectroscopically confirmed and 705 are new discoveries . </S>",
    "<S> the sources were identified from the analysis of five years of data , and come from an area covering three quarters of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> we study the amplitude distribution of the dwarf novae cvs discovered by crts during outburst , and find that in quiescence they are typically two magnitudes fainter compared to the spectroscopic cv sample identified by sdss . however , almost all crts cvs in the sdss footprint have @xmath0 photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the spatial distribution of the cvs and find evidence that many of the systems lie at scale heights beyond those expected for a galactic thin disc population . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the outburst rates of newly discovered crts cvs with the previously known cv population , and find no evidence for a difference between them . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that significant evidence for a systematic difference in orbital period distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the cvs found below the orbital period minimum and argue that many more are yet to be identified among the full crts cv sample . </S>",
    "<S> we cross - match the cvs with archival x - ray catalogs and find that most of the systems are dwarf novae rather than magnetic cvs .    </S>",
