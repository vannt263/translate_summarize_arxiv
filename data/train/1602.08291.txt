    "a version of the epr paradox prevents simultaneously doing work on a quantum system and knowing how much work has been done . a system can do work on its environment only if the two have a nonzero interaction energy . during interaction ,",
    "two become entangled , leading to a superposition of different possible values for the work . according to quantum mechanics , measuring the work projects into a state with exactly zero interaction energy .",
    "therefore the system - environment interaction is always either zero or unknown .",
    "one hundred years ago , einstein presented a first - order rate hypothesis concerning the rate of energy exchange between a molecular system and a reservoir of photons.@xcite under this hypothesis , the transition between states with known molecular energy levels by emission and absorption of discrete photons can be shown to bring about thermal equilibrium for all parties : the photons , the molecular energy levels , and the particle velocities .",
    "this semiclassical picture provided a clear , consistent , and straightforward picture for the time - evolution of coupled quantum systems .",
    "nevertheless , the argument must have appeared unsatisfactory at the time because it only provided a statistical , rather than an exact , mechanical description of the dynamics .",
    "many years later , einstein , podolsky , and rosen published the famous epr paradox.@xcite the paradox states that , before any measurement is made , neither position nor velocity exist as real physical quantities for a pair of entangled particles .",
    "either of the two choices can be ` made real ' only by performing a measurement .",
    "the consequence for energy exchange processes follows directly . for a particle entangled with a field ,",
    "neither a definite ( molecular energy level / photon number ) pair nor a definite ( stark state / field phase ) pair exist before any measurement is made .",
    "recent works on quantum fluctuation theorems confront this difficulty in a variety of ways .",
    "one of the most prominent is the stochastic schrdinger equation that replaces a dissipative quantum master equation with an ensemble of trajectories containing periodic jumps due to measurement.@xcite in that setup , the jump process represents dissipation , so heat is defined as any energy change in the system due to the jumps .",
    "other changes in energy , caused by varying the hamiltonian in time , are counted as work .",
    "fluctuation theorems for this process are based on the detailed balance condition for jumps due to the reservoir , avoiding most issues with defining a work measurement .",
    "the work of venkatesh@xcite shows that regular , projective measurement of work - like quantities based on the system alone ( such as time - derivative of the hamiltonian expectation ) generally leads to `` qualitatively different statistics from the [ two energy measurement ] definition of work and generally fail to satisfy the fluctuation relations of crooks and jarzynski . ''",
    "another major approach is to model the environment s action as a series of generic quantum maps .",
    "a physical interpretation as a two - measurement process accomplishing feedback control was given by funo.@xcite there , an initial partial projection provides classical information that is used to choose a hamiltonian to evolve the system for a final measurement .",
    "that work showed that the transition probabilities in the process obey an integral fluctuation theorem .",
    "although the interpretation relied on a final measurement of the system s energy , it provided one of the first examples for the entropic consequences of measurement back - action.@xcite    recent work on the statistics of the transition process for general quantum maps showed that the canonical fluctuation theorems hold if the maps can be decomposed into transitions between stationary states of the dynamics.@xcite this agrees with other works showing the importance of stationary states in computing entropy changes from quantum master equations.@xcite the back - action due to measurement is not present in this case .",
    "in contrast , the present work starts from a physically motivated process and shows that work and heat can be defined without recourse to stationary states of the central system . by doing so",
    ", it arrives at a clear picture of the back - action , and a minimum temperature argument .",
    "it also builds a quantum parallel to the measurement - based definition of work and heat for classical nonequilibrium systems laid out in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the transition probability ratio is shown to be equivalent to a physical separation of random and deterministic forces .",
    "although no fluctuation theorem can be shown in general , in the van hove limit , the interaction commutes with the stationary state,@xcite and a fluctuation theorem such as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite applies .",

    "a simple generalization discussed later is to waive the first constraint , but this is not investigated here .",
    "there have been many definitions proposed for heat and work in quantum systems . these fall roughly into three categories : the near - equilibrium limit , experimental work - based definitions , and mathematical definitions based on information theory .",
    "the near - equilibrium limit is one of the earliest models , and is based on the weak - coupling limit of a system interacting with a quantum energy reservoir at a set temperature over long time intervals .",
    "that model is probably the only general one derivable from first principles where it can be proven that every system will eventually relax to a canonical equilibrium distribution with the same temperature as the reservoir.@xcite the essential step is taking the van hove limit , where the system - reservoir interaction energy scale , @xmath4 , goes to zero ( weak coupling ) with constant probability for energy - conserving transitions ( which scale as @xmath5 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the only allowed transitions are those that conserve the uncoupled energy , @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamics then becomes a process obeying detailed - balance for hopping between energy levels of the system s hamiltonian , @xmath7 .",
    "states with energy superpositions can mix , but eventually decay to zero probability as long as the environment can couple to every system energy level .",

    "[ e : qw ] applies also amounts to an assumption that the system - environment pair is continually being projected into states with known @xmath12 .",
    "it is not suitable for use in deriving modern fluctuation theorems because its validity relies on the this limit .",
    "entropy can also be defined thermodynamically by analyzing physical processes taking an initial state to a final state .",
    "one of the simplest results using the thermodynamic approach is that even quantum processes obey a fluctuation theorem for exchanges of ( heat ) energy between system and environment when each transition conserves energy and there is no external driving force.@xcite on averaging , this agrees with the common experimental definition of heat production as the free energy change of two reservoirs set up to dissipate energy by a quantum contact that allows monitoring the energy exchange process.@xcite semiclassical trajectories have also been investigated as a means to show that postulated expressions for quantum work go over to the classical definition in the high - temperature or small-@xmath13",
    "limit.@xcite    other works in this category consider a process where the system s energy is measured at the start and end of a time - dependent driving process .",
    "it is then easy to show that the statistics of the energy change give a quantum version of the jarzynski equality for the free energy difference.@xcite more general results are difficult owing to the fact that , for coupled systems , quantum transitions that do not conserve energy are possible , giving rise to the paradox motivating this work .",
    "there have also been many mathematically - based definitions of entropy production for open quantum systems .",
    "the primary goal of a mathematical definition is to quantify the information contained in a quantum state.@xcite it is well - known that preparation of a more ordered system state from a less ordered one requires heat release proportional to the information entropy difference.@xcite from this perspective , information is more fundamental than measured heats , because it represents a lower bound on any physical process that could accomplish this transformation .",
    "a maximum work could be found from such a definition using energy conservation .",
    "however , the disadvantage of a mathematical definition is that it can not be used to construct a physical transformation process obeying these bounds .",
    "most of the bounds on mathematical entropy production are proven with the help of the klein inequality stating that relative entropy between two density matrices must be positive.@xcite there are , in addition , many connections with communication and measure theory that provide approximations to the relative entropy.@xcite    one particular class of mathematical definitions that has received special attention is the relative entropy , @xmath14 } \\notag \\\\ & = \\beta ( f(t ) - f^\\text{(eq ) } ) \\label{e : srel } \\\\ \\intertext { between an arbitrary density matrix and an ` instantaneous equilibrium ' state , } \\rho^\\text{inst } & = \\exp{\\left[-\\beta \\hat h^\\text{eff}(t)\\right]}/z^\\text{eff}(\\beta , t ) .\\label{e : pos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this definition is closely related to the physical process of measuring the system s energy at the start and end of a process .",
    "several notable results have been proven in those works , including work relations and integrated fluctuation theorems@xcite as well as useful upper and lower bounds.@xcite the present work is distinguished from these mathematical definitions because it completely removes the requirement for defining or using an ` instantaneous equilibrium ' distribution of the central system or directly measuring the central system at all .",
    "one of the primary motivations for this work has been to derive a firm theoretical foundation for analyzing time - sequences of measurements in hopes of better understanding the role of the environment in decoherence.@xcite the present paper provides a new way of understanding the gap between the lindblad operators describing the quantum master equation and the physical processes responsible for decoherence . rather than unravelling the lindblad equation , we choose a physical process and show how a lindblad equation emerges .",
    "this path shows the importance of the source of environmental noise in determining the low - temperature steady - state .",
    "the result also provides an alternative continuous time , monte carlo method for wavefunction evolution@xcite without using the dissipation operator associated with the lindblad master equation .    another outcome has been finding a likely explanation for the anomalous temperature of utsumi et .",
    "al.@xcite those works attempted to test the classical fluctuation theorems for electron transport through a quantum dot , and found that the effective temperature of 1.37 k ( derived from the slope of the transport odds ratio , @xmath15 ) was much higher than the electron temperature of 130 - 300 mk . trying to lower the temperature further below that point showed minimal changes in the slope , indicating a minimum temperature had been reached .",
    "sections  [ s : process ] and  [ s : therm ] present a repeated measurement process , and show that it allows for a physical definition of heat and work that occurs between successive measurements .",
    "measurements are only performed on the interacting reservoir , and ( because of entanglement ) cause instantaneous projection of the central system according to the standard rules of quantum mechanics . in this way , it is not required to define a temperature for the central system . because the central system is generally out of equilibrium ,",
    "the concept of equilibrium is applied only to the environmental interactions .",
    "section  [ s : clausius ] proves the clausius form of the second law for the new definitions , and section  [ s : jcm ] immediately applies these to the quantum theory of radiation .",
    "the limits of slow and fast measurement rates are investigated in sections  [ s : weak ] and  [ s : strong ] .",
    "the slow rate limit recovers einstein s picture of first - order rate processes and complies with eq .",
    "[ e : qw ] when the system - reservoir coupling , @xmath4 , is infinitesimally small .",
    "the fast measurement limit does not exhibit a quantum zeno paradox,@xcite but effectively injects white noise into the energy of the joint system  consistent with the energy - time uncertainty principle . at intermediate stages ,",
    "continuous finite interaction with the reservoir causes an effective increase in the ` temperature ' of the system s steady - state .",
    "although surprising , the measurement rate is unavoidable in the theory as it is the exact parameter controlling broadening of spectral lines.@xcite i end with a proof in section  [ s : mint ] that effects from the minimum achievable temperature will be seen when the reservoir temperature is less than the system s first excitation energy and the measurement rate is on the order of this excitation energy .",
    "to study the action of continual environmental measurement on part of a quantum system , i propose the following process ( fig .  [",
    "f : ref ] ) :    1 .",
    "let @xmath16 represent a general wavefunction of the central system , and @xmath17 represent the state of the measurement device at energy level @xmath18 .",
    "the central system is coupled to the measurement device whose state is chosen at random from a starting distribution , @xmath19 , ( panel d - a ) @xmath20 the starting distribution must have a well - defined energy , and so @xmath19 should be diagonal in the energy basis of system @xmath21 .",

    "the operation of measurement disconnects the two systems , and , more importantly , makes the energy of the reservoir system correspond to a physical observable .",
    "a complete accounting for heat in quantum mechanics can be made using only these measurements on ancillary systems , rather than the central , @xmath30 , system .",
    "the thermodynamics based on this accounting allows the central system to retain most of its quantum character , while at the same time deriving the traditional , operational relationships between heat and work .",
    "although the analysis below is phrased in terms of density matrices , that view is equivalent to carrying out this process many times with individual wave - functions . specifically , if @xmath31 , is composed of any number of pure states,@xcite the final density matrix at time @xmath32 is a linear function of @xmath33 and hence of each @xmath34 . carrying out the process on individual wave - functions",
    "thus allows an extra degree of choice in how to compose @xmath35 , the use of which does not alter any of the results .",
    "this process is a repeatable version of the measurement and feedback control process studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and fits into the general quantum map scheme of ref .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis finds different results because the thermodynamic interpretation of the environment and measuring device allows the reservoir to preform work in addition to exchanging heat .",

    "the entanglement is projected out , so it is again permissible to refer to the properties of the @xmath30 and @xmath21 systems separately .",
    "after a measurement , the total energy of the system / reservoir pair will have changed from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",

    ", this measurement energy does not correspond to an element of physical reality .",
    "nevertheless , the starting and ending @xmath7 , @xmath39 are conserved quantities under the uncoupled time - evolution , and so the energy of the measurement step can be objectively defined in an indirect way .",
    "this instantaneous measurement of the reservoir simulates the physical situation where an excitation in the reservoir leaks out into the environment .",
