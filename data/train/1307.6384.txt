    "ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  is one of the few x - ray binaries that have been detected from radio to tev gamma rays ( see albert et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "it is perhaps the most intriguing one due to the high variability and richness of its phenomenology at all frequencies .",
    "ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303   consists of a be star of approximately 10 solar masses , and a compact object .",
    "be stars are rapidly rotating b - type stars showing hydrogen balmer lines in emission in the stellar spectrum , and which lose mass to an equatorial circumstellar disc .",
    "the nature of the compact object in ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  has been much debated over the past few years : pulsar wind interaction ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and microquasar jets ( see @xcite for a review ) have been proposed as the origin of the non - thermal emission .",
    "the recent detection of two short ( @xmath4 s ) , highly - luminous ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) , thermal flares @xcite have given support to the hypothesis that the compact object in ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  is a neutron star , for only highly - magnetized neutron stars have been found to behave in this way .",
    "the flux of ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  is seen to be modulated by the orbital period of 26.4960 days @xcite at most wavelengths , including at high energies @xcite .",
    "orbital modulation of the gev flux can be understood as a consequence of changing conditions for generation and absorption of gamma rays , which are mostly determined by the orbital geometry ; e.g. , the viewing angle to the observer and the position of the compact object with respect to the stellar companion .",
    "unless other physical conditions change , we do not expect long - term variability of the emission level at a fixed orbital configuration . in order to investigate ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303 s variability",
    ", we analyzed _",
    "fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) data from the beginning of scientific operations on 2008 august 4 until 2013 march 24 .",
    "we report on the results in this _ letter_.",
    "we used the lat science tools package ( v9r30 ) , which is available from the _ fermi _ science support center , as is the lat data , together with the _ p7v6 _ version of the instrument response functions .",
    "only events passing the pass 7 `` source '' class cuts are used in the analysis .",
    "all gamma rays with energies @xmath7 mev within a circular region of interest ( roi ) of 10@xmath2 radius centered on ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303were extracted . to reduce the contamination from the earth s upper atmosphere time intervals when the earth limb was in the field of view",
    "were excluded , specifically when the rocking angle of the lat was greater than @xmath8 or when parts of the roi were observed at zenith angles @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux of ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303   plotted in the light curves of this work are calculated by performing the binned or the unbinned maximum likelihood method , depending on the statistics , by means of the science tool gtlike .",
    "the spectral - spatial model constructed to perform the likelihood analysis includes all the sources of the second _ fermi_-lat point - source catalog @xcite ( hereafter 2fgl ) within 15@xmath10 of ls",
    "i  @xmath161@xmath2303 .",
    "the spectral parameters were fixed to the catalog values , except for the sources within 3@xmath10 of ls",
    "i  @xmath161@xmath2303 . for these latter sources ,",
    "the flux normalization was left free .",
    "ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  was modeled with an exponentially cut off power - law spectral shape .",
    "all its spectral parameters were allowed to vary ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the models adopted for the galactic diffuse emission ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ) and isotropic backgrounds ( iso_p7v6source.txt ) were those recommended by the lat team .",
    "systematic errors mainly originate in the uncertainties in the effective area of the lat , as well as in the galactic diffuse emission model .",
    "the current estimate of the uncertainties of the effective area is 10% at 100 mev , decreasing to 5% at 560 mev and increasing to 10% at 10 gev and above .",
    "we assume linear extrapolations , in log space , between the quoted energies .",
    "the systematic effect is estimated by repeating the likelihood analysis using modified instrument response functions that bracket the `` p7source_v6 '' effective areas .",
    "specifically , they are a set of instrument response functions in which the effective area has been modified considering its uncertainty as a function of energy in order to maximally affect a specific spectral parameter . in order to conservatively take into account the effect due to the uncertainties of the galactic diffuse emission model",
    ", the likelihood fits are repeated changing the normalization of the galactic diffuse model artificially by @xmath11 .",
    "we have found flux systematic errors ( for energies above 100 mev ) on the order of 9% , similar to the ones reported in @xcite .",

    "the test is performed by computing the ratio @xmath16 for the two hypotheses ( constant and sinusoidal ) and assuming that for a chance coincidence the ratios are @xmath17-distributed according to the difference in the degrees of freedom between the two hypotheses .",
    "thus , if the hypothesis of a constant is true , the likelihood ratio @xmath18 is approximately @xmath14-distributed with 2 degrees of freedom . the probability that one hypothesis is preferred over the other is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath14 probability density function and @xmath21 the measured value of @xmath22 .",

    "the choice of a sinusoidal function for fitting the data is not based on any _ a priori _ physical expectation ; the superorbital variability could be periodic but have a different shape",
    ". however , any periodic function could be described by a series of sines .",
    "thus , fitting with just one sinusoidal function as done above is motivated by the relatively low number of data points .",
    "no strong variability is found at orbital phases 0.00.5 , while it is clearly present in the range 0.51.0 .",
    "concurrently , data at the orbital phases 0.0 to 0.5 are not significantly better - represented by a sine than by a constant",
    ". however , this is not the case for the data at the orbital phases 0.5 to 1.0 .",
    "the probability that the sinusoidal fit improvement occurs by chance is less than @xmath32 at orbital phases 0.50.6 , 0.60.7 , 0.80.9 , and 0.91.0 ; and @xmath33 at orbital phases 0.7 - 0.8 . whereas the sinusoidal variation is always a better fit in this part of the orbit , the amplitude of the fit is maximal in orbital phases before and after the apastron .    in order to test for the appearance / disappearance of the orbital signature in gamma rays",

    "the selected events were used to create a light curve of weighted counts over exposure with equally spaced time bins of 2.4 hours width .",

    "[ powspec ] shows the power spectra calculated in each of the time intervals .",
    "the vertical line marks the orbital period ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the y - axis in the periodograms is given in average power units , which converts the original spectrum in units of ( ph @xmath34 s@xmath6)@xmath35 by normalizing it with the average of the power over all the frequencies @xmath36 . in this way",
    ", the units are directly linked to the significance of the peak , which for a peak of power @xmath37 is computed as @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "these average power values are plotted in fig .",
    "[ flux - so ] .",
    "a significant peak is detected at the orbital period , but not in all time intervals .",
    "note that in some of the panels of fig .",
    "[ powspec ] there appears to be a shift of the 26.5-day peak , even though it is within the fundamental frequency ( @xmath39 ) of the orbital period .",
    "a claim that the period shift of these peaks is significant would then imply a severe oversampling of the fourier resolution , which for the duration of this dataset is 3.84 days .",
    "the shifted peaks are not significant either in the single - trial ( looking for an specific frequency ) or in the all - trials probability analysis of these power spectra .",
    "thus , we have now found that along the time covered by our observations , the power spectrum peak at the orbital period is significant only at superorbital phases @xmath40 . at other superorbital phases ,",
    "the peak is absent or has a significance less than 3@xmath41 .",
    "over the last two decades , systematic monitoring of many be x - ray systems allowed the discovery of many cases of superorbital cycles ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in order to connect the discovered @xmath0-ray observational pattern to conditions that vary over the superorbit , a quasi - cyclical expansion and shrinking of the circumstellar disc of a be star may offer an alternative ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sizes of the stellar discs of be stars are hypothesized to correlate with the equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath42 emission line ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the longest - running campaign observing ls",
    "i  @xmath161@xmath2303 the maximum of the h@xmath42 ew has been found in a broad region around superorbital phase @xmath43 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray @xcite as well as the @xmath0-ray emission are enhanced at superorbital phases where maximal values of the h@xmath42 ew have been measured .",
    "concurrently , the power spectrum peak at the orbital period is less significant .",
    "this suggests that the disc may play a role in modulating both the gamma and the x - ray signals .    from the results in fig .",
    "[ superorb - var ] , one may conclude that in the periastron region , when the emission from the system is subject to essentially no superorbital variability , the conditions for the generation of gamma rays in the gev range must not significantly change .",
    "we can thus assume that the compact object could be inside or severely affected by the be disc matter when it is closer to the companion star ( i.e. , at orbital phases 0.0 to 0.5 ) , for all superorbital phases .",
    "if this is the case , even when the ew of the h@xmath42 line ( and thus the radius within which the disc influences ) changes by a factor of a few along the superorbital period,61@xmath2303  were estimated as the ratio between maximal and minimal values of its radio emission ( a factor of @xmath445 was determined by @xcite ) or its h@xmath42 measurements , which span factors of @xmath441.5 to 5 @xcite .",
    "] this does not necessarily imply a significant change in the @xmath0-ray modulation above the sensitivity of _",
    "fermi_-lat when the compact object is near periastron .",
    "however , in a two - component model typically assumed for be stellar winds ( an equatorial wind generating the disc , and a polar outflow ) the conditions in the apastron region ( e.g. , the pressure exerted by the wind , or the mass gravitationally captured by the compact object ) could change by more than 3 orders of magnitude if one or the other component dominates ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in such a case , it is reasonable to suppose that the gev emission would be affected at an observable level .",
    "we notice from fig .",
    "[ superorb - var ] that between the orbital phase ranges 0.91.0 and 0.00.1 there is a significant change of the long - term behavior of the @xmath0-ray emission . closer to periastron the flux evolution flattens .",
    "we can then estimate the radius at which the matter in the disc of the be star produces a stable influence with time by computing the system separation at orbital phase @xmath45 . using the ephemeris given by aragona et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we obtain a separation of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the stellar radius of the be star . on the other hand , from the fact that the maximal amplitude of the superorbital variability is before and after the apastron of the system , the system separation at orbital phases 0.7 and 0.9 ( @xmath48 ) could also have a physical meaning .",
    "it is a qualitative upper limit to the influence of the matter in the equatorial outflow when maximally enhanced by the long - term change of the stellar mass - loss rate .",
    "the ratio between what appears to be the maximal and the stable radii of influence of the disc matter is consistent with a possible increase of the ew of the h@xmath42 line .",
    "outer radii of discs in binaries are expected to be truncated by the gravitational influence of their compact companions ; at the periastron distances in systems of high eccentricity , and by resonances between the orbital period and the disc gas rotational periods in the low - eccentricity systems @xcite .",
    "ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  is a system between these two cases .",
    "the effects of the be star s rotation , which have only recently started to be taken into account , may modify this conclusion , predicting disc sizes in excess of 10 @xmath47 @xcite . assuming the relation between disc size and the ew of the h@xmath42 by @xcite , and not taking into account rotation effects , typical values of the ew of ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303  would lead to an estimation of the disc radius of the order of the periastron distance @xcite .",
    "simulations indicate that tidal pulls at periastron can lead to the development of large spiral waves in the disc that can extend far beyond the truncation radius and out to the vicinity of the companion ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , promoting accretion @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray data apparently provide a window to infer the extent of these waves .    depending on the period and dipolar magnetic field",
    ", a highly - magnetized neutron star can transition between states along the orbital evolution of ls  i  @xmath161@xmath2303 , changing its behavior from propeller ( near periastron ) to ejector ( near apastron ) along each orbit @xcite .",
    "these changes of state can be affected by the superorbital variability , since for a larger disc - influence radius , the system will remain in the same environment for a longer time @xcite .",
    "the orbital variability is consequently reduced , leading to the disappearance of the orbital peak in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the data presented in this report will put the details of this model to the test while opening the @xmath0-ray window for studying the discs of be binaries .",
