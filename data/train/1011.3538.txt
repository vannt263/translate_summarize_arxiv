    "the search for planets around giants represent an essential complement to `` traditional '' surveys , because they furnish information about properties of planetary systems around stars that are the descendants of the a ",
    "f main sequence ( ms ) stars with masses as high as @xmath1 .",
    "as the stars evolve off the ms , their effective temperatures and rotation rates decrease to the point that their radial velocity ( rv ) variations can be measured with a few ms@xmath2 precision .",
    "this offers an excellent opportunity to improve our understanding of the population of planets around stars that are significantly more massive than the sun . without such surveys it would be difficult to construct a broad , integrated picture of planet formation and evolution .",
    "since 2001 , about 30 such objects have been identified , including our five published detections with the hobby - eberly telescope ( het , @xcite ) .",
    "our work has produced the tightest orbit of a planet orbiting a k - type giant identified so far ( 0.6 au ) and the first convincing evidence for a multi - planet system around such a star @xcite .",
    "our recent discoveries @xcite have also identified new multi - planet systems , including a very intriguing one of two brown dwarf - mass bodies orbiting a @xmath3 , k2 giant .",
    "this particular detection challenges the standard interpretation of the so - called brown dwarf desert known to exist in the case of solar - mass stars . along with the discoveries supplied by other groups",
    "our work has substantially added to the emerging evidence that stellar mass positively correlates with masses of substellar companions , all the way from red dwarfs to intermediate - mass stars .    in this paper",
    "we present the current status and forthcoming results from the penn state - toru planet search ( ptps ) around g ",
    "k giants with the het since 2004 .",
    "high - precision radial velocity determination for ms stars more massive than @xmath4 are not possible due to small number of spectral lines present in the spectra of these stars and their significant rotational broadening .",
    "however , it is possible to obtain precise rvs for intermediate - mass stars after they have left the ms and become subgiants or giants cool enough to develop spectra that are rich in narrow lines . among the various planet detection methods in the case of stars more massive than @xmath5 rv searches",
    "provide the most efficient way to do it , while for stars more massive than @xmath6 they are practically the only way .",
    "the whole ptps targets sample of nearly 1000 late - type stars observed with this survey ( fig .",
    "1 ) comprises about 350 giants from the giant clump , about 350 giants and subgiants , and roughly 250 evolved stars in the upper envelope of the ms ( aging dwarfs ) . in terms of using the rv technique , this star sample is limited to 0.4@xmath7 @xmath8 1.2@xmath7 and concentrated around 1.5@xmath7 above the ms .",
    "moreover , all ptps targets are uniformly distributed in right ascension and declination on the sky .",
    "the magnitude upper limit of the stars in the @xmath9 band is 11@xmath7 and usually ( > 66  % ) the program stars are fainter than 8@xmath7 .",
    "observations for the ptps have been obtained with the @xmath10 het @xcite equipped with the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs , r=60000 , @xcite ) in the queue scheduled mode @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph was fed with a 2  arcsec fiber .",
    "the spectra consisted of 46 echelle orders recorded on the `` blue '' ccd chip ( 407592 nm ) and 24 orders on the `` red '' chip ( 602784 nm ) . a typical signal - to - noise ratio was 200250 per resolution element .",
    "the basic data reduction was performed in a standard manner using the iraf tasks and scripts .",
    "the observing strategy was focused on long - term variations in rvs which were measured using the standard i@xmath11 cell calibration technique @xcite .",
    "details of our survey , the observing procedure and data analysis , have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "late type giants are known to exhibit various types of intrinsic variability induced by pulsations and/or surface inhomogeneity connected with rotation .",
    "these effects have to be ruled out before substellar companion interpretation can be considered .",
    "therefore , proper interpretation of results obtained from rv survey of g  k giants requires detailed knowledge of their physical parameters .",
    "an atmospheric model of the star is characterized by effective temperature @xmath12 , surface gravity @xmath13 , microturbulence velocity @xmath14 , and metallicity [ fe / h ] . to obtain these parameters from high resolution spectra",
    ", we used a purely spectroscopic method developed by @xcite which is based on the measurements of equivalent widths ( ews ) of iron lines and resulting from the assumption of lte .",
    "we were able to find and measure the ews of @xmath0300 fei and feii lines in our spectra . to avoid a perturbation of the mean iron abundance ( and thus [ fe / h ] ) dependency on the excitation potential and ews , we selected the lines not stronger than 150200 m .",
    "figure  2 presents the results determined from the method mentioned above and the dependencies between atmospheric parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and [ fe / h ] ) in the case of clump giants .",
    "the consistency of the solutions is clearly visible and remains in agreement with common features of red giant clump ( rgc ) stars .",
    "the average uncertainties of the following parameters are @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) } = 0.05 $ ] , @xmath17 , and @xmath18[fe / h]@xmath19",
    ". only for individual stars these values are slightly higher .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and [ fe / h ] together with hipparcos / tycho data allows the estimation of stellar bolometric magnitudes m@xmath20 and luminosities @xmath21 .",
    "the rest of necessary quantities , such as intrinsic colour @xmath22 and bolometric correction bc , can be determined for each star using empirical calibration taken from @xcite . to obtain the stellar mass , radius , and age , i.e.  the parameters constraining the stellar evolution ,",
    "the position of the each single star should be compared with appropriate evolutionary tracks and isochrones on the h - r diagram @xcite , although the accurate estimation of these parameters is made very difficult due to the complex nature of the rgc region in the h - r diagram .",
    "figures  3 and 4 show the distributions of masses and radii estimated from the general definitions based on @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath21 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that these estimates do not take into account the stellar composition , which is a very important factor influencing the stellar evolution .",
    "nevertheless , both distributions under consideration confirm that we study the objects in the range 13 @xmath23 and 813 @xmath24 .",
    "the typical systematical errors are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "however , we should mention that for many cases the uncertainties are much higher because of the moderate quality of stellar photometry available in the astronomical databases and/or high uncertainties in hipparcos parallaxes .",

    "since 2004 , conclusive multi - epoch observations have been gathered for about 800 stars .",
    "the large number of data allow for a preliminary assessment of possible companion candidates , and , depending on the criteria adopted , the substellar - mass companion frequency may reach up to 30@xmath28 in the case of the whole ptps sample .        until today seven stars from ptps survey",
    "have been confirmed to be orbited by planetary systems .",
    "the first ten substellar - mass companions discovered by the ptps are shown in fig .",
    "in addition to the published planet and brown dwarf companions , we also present two new planets around bd+20 274 and hd 240237 ( gettel et al .  in preparation ) , and one around hd 17028 ( nowak et al .  in preparation ) .    the precise knowledge of stellar parameters is also important in terms of the statistical correlations between planet occurrence frequency , their orbital parameters , and stellar mass or metallicity . the forthcoming study ( zieliski et al .  in preparation ) shall give a new set of data , and together with previous work @xcite , it will bring more information for statistical analysis and improve the general knowledge concerning the evolution of stars and planetary system formation scenarios .",
