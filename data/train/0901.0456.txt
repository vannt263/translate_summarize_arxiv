    "an important biological function for dna loops is that it has abundant deformations under different conditions .",
    "this deformations are mostly due to the interaction between the dna chain and the environment .",
    "for instance , protein operation @xcite , ion concentration @xcite and temperature change @xcite all can induce deformations . since it has been found that dna shapes and deformations can be investigated by the kirchhoff elastic theory , much work have been done based on this theory @xcite .",
    "however , modern experimental techniques , such as optical tweezers @xcite , micromanipulation @xcite and other techniques @xcite , indicate that dna has abundant mechanic characteristics which can not be explained by classical kirchhoff theory .",
    "for example , under different pulling force , dna has different stretching ability @xcite .",
    "thus , several different models have been suggested to describe dna chain in different conditions .",
    "for instance , the wormlike chain ( wlc ) model @xcite was used to describe dna under a small external force . and",
    "the wlrc model @xcite is appropriate to describe dna with its double - helix structure under a moderate force .",
    "further , following the increase of external force , new energy terms are introduced @xcite , and the results are highly consistent with the experimental observations .    based on the kirchhoff theory ,",
    "the free energy density of duplex dna chain can be written as [ kirchhoff ] = a_1(k_1-|k_1)^2+a_2(k_2-|k_2)^2 + a_3(k_3-|k_3)^2 , where @xmath0 and \\{@xmath1 } denotes the basis of the local coordinates on dna chain @xcite , and @xmath2 is the arc length of dna centreline , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are spontaneous curvature and @xmath7 is spontaneous tension .",
    "let @xmath8 be the angle between @xmath9 and the main normal @xmath10 , we have [ relate ] k_1=k ,  k_2=k ,  k_3=+ , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the curvature and torsion of the dna centreline .",
    "an overdot denotes a differential with respect to @xmath2 . then the energy density in ( [ kirchhoff ] )",
    "can be changed into [ energy ] = ( k , , , ) & = & k^2(a_1 ^ 2+a_2 ^ 2 ) + & & -k(a_1|k_1+a_2|k_2 ) + & & + a_3(+-|k_3)^2+constant , and the shape equations are shown in @xcite .",
    "considering the energy density in ( [ energy ] ) contains @xmath13 , thus , any @xmath14 model , such as the helfrich model @xcite , the wlrc model @xcite and the wlc model @xcite , can not be equal to the classical kirchhoff model , because they can not give any information about the twist angle @xmath13 . but specially choose @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and let @xmath17 , the energy density in ( [ energy ] ) is reduced to & = & k^2-t_0ak+(+c-|k_3)^2+constant , where @xmath18 . if @xmath19 , we get the wlrc model .",
    "but in this paper we choose @xmath20 and @xmath17 , and name this model the extended worm - like road chain ( ewlrc ) model .",
    "we think the ewlrc model with @xmath20 is better than the wlrc model to a certain extent because the arbitrary constant @xmath21 can partly reflect that the twist angle @xmath13 and spontaneous curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 influence dna shapes .",
    "then we choose energy density as the form [ ewlrc ] = ( k - t_0)^2+(-_0)^2 , where @xmath22 and we also name it the spontaneous tension . clearly , the ewlrc model is different from the model discussed in @xcite by choosing @xmath23 and @xmath24 in ( [ kirchhoff ] ) .    by studying the second variation of dna s free energy , zhao _",
    "_ @xcite found that the chiral term in energy function could induce abundant shape transformations of dna rings in the helfrich model , which is in good agreement with the experimental observations in @xcite . in @xcite , zhou _",
    "_ showed that the spontaneous curvature plays a significant role in the stability of kinked dna . by choosing euler angles as variable for the free energy function , panyukov and rabin @xcite generally investigated the effects of thermal fluctuations on elastic rings and pointed out that spontaneous curvature is important in affecting the spatial configurations of the ring . in this paper , we discuss the second variation of the @xmath25 model and give stability condition of ring solution in sec .",

    "[ sectiii ] , we take the ewlrc model as an example and obtain some useful results which are very consistent with experimental observations . finally , a short discussion is given in sec .",

    "the central axis @xmath29 of duplex dna chain under small perturbations can be written as [ eq5 ] * * r**^(s)=*r*(s)+(s)**n**+(s ) , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two small smooth functions , and @xmath32 and @xmath10 are the binormal vector and the main normal vector , respectively . under the perturbations ,",
