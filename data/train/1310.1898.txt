    "the expansion rate of the universe has been determined by using type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as standard candles @xcite .",
    "pathways for the progenitor evolution of sne ia include the single degenerate ( sd ) @xcite , double degenerate ( dd ) @xcite , and double detonation scenarios @xcite .",
    "all the three scenarios require the presence of at least one co white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system .",
    "the thermonuclear ignition of the co wd is triggered when its mass reaches the chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "in addition to the double detonation , several sub - chandrasekhar co wd scenarios have been proposed in the recent years @xcite .    in any case , a sn ia explosion requires first formation of a co wd .",
    "the observed sn ia rates can be used to constrain the theoretical models of sn ia progenitor systems @xcite .",
    "population synthesis models rely on input from the theory of stellar evolution to determine the rates and delay times of sn ia @xcite .",
    "one obviously important input for such models is the initial mass range of co wds .",
    "the closer the initial mass of the formed co wd to the chandrasekhar limit , the sooner it will reach this limit by accreting material either from its non - degenerate companion ( in the sd scanario ) or from the double - degenerate post - merger disk ( in the dd scenario ) . in standard stellar evolution models ,",
    "the maximum mass of a co wd from single star evolution is @xmath5 . in a co core above this mass limit , carbon is ignited and its burning eventually turns the entire core into an one wd that can not experience a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "an alternative possibility has been proposed by @xcite and it will be discussed below . in standard models , however , carbon is ignited in the cores of stars with initial masses between @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite , and an one wd that reaches the chandrasekhar mass ends up as an electron - capture supernova collapsing into a neutron star @xcite .    the value of the upper initial mass limit for stars that produce wd progenitors of sne ia , @xmath8 , predicted by stellar evolution simulations depends on several physics assumptions and model parameters , such as stellar rotation and metallicity .",
    "for example , m@xmath9 increases with metallicity @xcite .",
    "another important assumption is the carbon ( @xmath10 ) burning rate ( hereafter , cbr ) . for a larger cbr",
    ", c ignites at a lower temperature , hence at a lower core mass corresponding to a lower initial mass .",
    "a larger cbr therefore implies a smaller value for @xmath8 and vice versa . like rates of other important charged particle reactions ,",
    "the cbr at stellar temperatures is determined by extrapolation of experimental data obtained for a higher energy in the interval between 2 mev and 6 mev to the gamow peak energy of about 1.5 mev , corresponding to c burning at the temperature of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "possible resonance @xcite or hindrance @xcite have been speculated to be present near the gamow energy and , as a result , the uncertainty of the total cbr may be of several orders of magnitude .",
    "the impact of different cbrs on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of massive stars @xcite as well as on the superburst ignition @xcite have been explored in the literature .",
    "the exact value of @xmath8 affects population synthesis predictions for sn ia progenitors in two ways .",
    "a larger value of @xmath8 means that the more massive and shorter lived agb stars can produce co wds , which therefore reduces the delay time of sne ia .",
    "the delay time is the time taken for sne ia to appear after a star formation burst .",
    "besides , a larger value of @xmath8 increases the total number of progenitors of wds that can explode as sne ia . in the sd scenario",
    ", a larger value of @xmath8 also means that the most massive co wds need to accrete less material to reach the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "in addition to the uncertainy of the cbr , it has recently been shown that the treatment of convective boundaries in co cores of super - agb stars may have an important effect on the initial mass range of possible sn ia progenitors . in the standard model ,",
    "c burning propagates all the way to the centre after off - centre c ignition and , as a result , the entire co wd turns into an one wd , even when c burning starts far from the centre . @xcite",
    "have constructed models of super - agb stars that ignite c off centre and include a small amount of convective boundary mixing similar in its length scale to those required to explain the observed abundance anomalies in classical novae and in h - deficient post - agb stars @xcite . in these models ,",
    "convective boundary mixing causes the c - flame to stall , which eventually prevents it from reaching the centre .",
    "this produces a c - o - ne hybrid wd at the end of super - agb star evolution with a significant unburnt co core surrounded by a thick one shell . with a sufficient amount of c still left in the centre",
    "some super - agb stars could be candidates to provide wd progenitors of sne ia .",
    "* such sne can probably be distinguished from their more common counterparts resulting from carbon explosion in co wds because the mass - averaged abundance of c in hybrid wds is significantly smaller and it depends on the initial mass of the star .",
    "this can potentially explain the observed diversity of sne ia in their explosion strength @xcite .",
    "* if such c - o - ne hybrid wds are confirmed as sn ia progenitors , the value of m@xmath9 may no longer be considered as the largest initial mass ( @xmath12 ) of a star that can produce a co wd , but rather as the largest @xmath12 that can produce a hybrid wd with a sufficiently large co core to ignite a sn ia .",
    "the addition of the hybrid wds to the co wds will not only increase the number of sn ia progenitors but also decrease the average delay time of sne ia .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the upper initial mass limit for stars that can produce wd progenitors of sne ia by taking into account the uncertainties in the cbr in combination with different assumptions about convective boundary mixing , including the possibility of the formation of hybrid wds .",
    "in sect.[sec : method ] , we briefly describe our simulation tools before we present the results in sect.[sec : results ] .",
    "finally , a discussion is provided in sect.[sec : diss_n_concl ] .",
    "the stellar evolution simulations performed in this study used the modules for experiments in stellar evolution ( mesa ) code version 4442 @xcite .",
    "each stellar evolution simulation begins with a pre - main sequence star model .",
    "the mass of the model is first automatically chosen by the code at a value closest to our specified initial mass and then adjusted to the targeted value using the mesa controlled mass gain or loss .",
    "we have to calculate masses of h- and he - free cores .",
    "the boundaries of these cores are defined by the mass coordinates at which the abundances of h and he reach specified low values when being approached from the stellar surface downwards . in this paper",
    ", we use the mass fractions of h and he equal to 0.01 and 0.05 for the h- and he - free core boundaries , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to the places of the maximum energy production in the h and he burning shells .",
    "the adopted nuclear network contains reactions of h , he and c burning .",
    "most of the reaction rates used in mesa are taken from caughlan & fowler ( cf88 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and angulo et al .",
    "( nacre , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we vary the cbr by applying a multiplicative factor ( 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 100 and 1000 ) to its standard recommended value .",
    "the nuclear physics of the @xmath13+@xmath13  rate has been summarized recently by @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to their discussions .",
    "the possible reduction of the cbr due to the hindrance effect strongly increases when the temperature decreases .",
    "the temperature characteristic of c - flame burning is @xmath14 , for which the hindrance model suggests a reduction of the cbr by a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "most carbon burning takes place in super - agb star models at @xmath15 between @xmath16 k and @xmath17 k. at temperatures as low as @xmath18 , the hindrance effect may reduce the cbr by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the cbr reduction factors of @xmath20 and @xmath3 to be associated with the hindrance .",
    "the smaller factor is probably a bit less than that presently considered as the most reasonable lower limit for the cbr uncertainty range .",
    "hidden resonances may increase the cbr substantially and , following @xcite , we consider for them the enhancement factors of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    the main goal of our analysis is to estimate the mass limits for the co , c - o - ne hybrid and one wds .",
    "for each value of the cbr and assumption about convective boundary mixing , a grid of stellar models with initial masses in the range between @xmath24 and @xmath25 with a fine mass resolution was computed , so that the transition masses were determined within @xmath26 .",
    "all the simulation runs have the initial metallicity of @xmath27 .",
    "the c and o enhanced opacities were enabled .",
    "the opacities used by mesa are derived from the type 1 and 2 opal tables @xcite , optionally from the op tables @xcite , and from @xcite .",
    "the initial metallicity of the star is used as the base metallicity for the co enhanced opacities .",
    "convective mixing is treated by mesa as a diffusive process with a diffusion coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 is determined using a mixing length theory module .",
    "mesa treats convective overshooting , that we call here convective boundary mixing , as an exponential decay of @xmath30 immediately outside a convective zone on a length scale of @xmath31 pressure scale heights at the schwarzschild boundary .",
    "this should appropriately approximate mixing caused by hydrodynamic instabilities at convective boundaries .",
    "for all evolutionary phases preceding c ignition , we use the convective boundary mixing parameter @xmath32 .",
    "this value has been fitted to the observed terminal age main sequences for a large number of star clusters @xcite . for convective boundaries associated with any nuclear burning other than hydrogen burning",
    ", the @xmath31 parameter is set to be zero to reproduce the standard case that does not produce any c - o - ne hybrid cores , and @xmath33 is adopted for the convective boundary mixing at the bottom of the c - burning convection zone following @xcite .",
    "special care has been taken to ensure that the c flames are properly resolved .",
    "we add mesh resolution constraints to ensure very high spatial resolution with respect to the @xmath13  abundance and @xmath15 profile as described by @xcite , and we reproduce their results .    our computations are set to terminate at the first thermal pulse .",
    "however , models with convective boundary mixing sometimes become numerically demanding after the end of the second dredge - up in that their core masses do not change much anymore before the first thermal pulse occurs . given that during this phase the core mass would only change by @xmath34 , we have decided to skip this phase and report core masses attained by the end of the second dredge - up .",
    "we have performed two simulation sets .",
    "the first set was done with no convective boundary mixing during c burning ( @xmath35 ) to reproduce the standard scenario in which the ignited carbon flame never fails in transforming a co core inside a super - agb star into an one core .",
    "the second set used the convective boundary parameter @xmath36 , which resulted in hybrid c - o - ne wds .",
    "all the other parameters in each set , except the initial mass and the cbr factor , had the same values .",
    "+   +    like in the second set , convective boundary mixing was modeled with @xmath37 at the interface between the helium core / shell and hydrogen envelope , while everywhere else we used @xmath32 to be in accord with an observationally constrained stellar evolutionary model prior to the start of carbon burning @xcite .",
    "our results are here briefly compared with the investigation of the c flame propagation in super - agb stars by @xcite .",
    "he computed models that did not take into account any mixing mechanisms beyond the classical convection defined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "the kippenhahn diagrams for two of our stellar evolution runs that are representative for the cases with similar initial mass that produced co cores and one cores are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kipabuf0 ] with their respective chemical abundance profiles taken at the end of simulation .    like in siess study , whenever carbon is ignited in the core of a super - agb star , its burning is either too week to propagate any distance and therefore it is quickly quenched , or it is strong enough to cause several episodes of convection and to propagate all the way to the centre , thus burning most of the carbon into neon .",
    "there is not a single case in which the co core is left partially burnt .",
    "how the c flame usually propagates in the latter case is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kipabuf0]c .",
    "the deflagration wave of the c flame usually has an intermittent character .",
    "the consecutive carbon burning episodes usually start with a carbon flash followed by one or more deflagrations ignited below the first flash .",
    "these series of deflagrations eventually lead to the propagation of the carbon flame to the centre of the core .",
    "since siess did not include any main - sequence convective core overshooting in his simulations , the least massive star that was able to ignite carbon in his simulations was more massive than its counterpart in our investigation . the difference between their initial masses is @xmath38 which is in good agreement with what can be found in the literature @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ccm ] . the upper limit of the co core increases as the cbr decreases .",
    "interestingly , the core mass boundary that marks the co to one transition appears nearly linear with respect to the logarithm of the cbr .",

    "the h - free core of an agb star consists of a he - free core surrounded by a he shell whose mass is negligible .",
    "therefore , following @xcite , we consider the mass of the h - free core as a main result of our calculations*. in general , the final core mass @xmath39 increases with the initial stellar mass @xmath12 .",
    "stars with @xmath12 less than @xmath40 , however , have a roughly constant @xmath39 .",
    "this relation is valid down to the lowest @xmath12 that was modelled , i.e. @xmath41 . as expected , the ifmr only has a dependency on the cbr in the mass regime where one cores are produced as the result of carbon burning .",
    "the @xmath39 of any given one core has always been found to be higher than their counterparts produced from the same @xmath12 but with a lower cbr .",
    "the second set of our simulations models convective boundary mixing with @xmath33 at the bottom of convective c - burning , but otherwise it is the same as the standard case presented above .",
    "our models cover the complete initial mass range for hybrid c - o - ne wds .",

    "c burning stops before any substantial amount of @xmath13  has been burnt .",
    "a small pocket of @xmath43  remains in the core .",
    "however , this case would result in a normal co wd .",

    "the middle panel shows the case with a cbr factor of 10 .",
    "this case results in a hybrid c - o - ne core as described by @xcite .",
    "there appears to exist a continuum of co core masses that remain unburnt in the centre of hybrid cores .",
    "we have defined a hybrid core preliminarily as a core that has a @xmath44c rich centre which occupies more than 1@xmath45 of the total core mass and is surrounded by a @xmath46ne rich shell .",
    "the central @xmath44c abundance needs to be at least a hundred times larger than @xmath46ne by mass fraction in order to be considered `` rich '' .",
    "these hybrid cores often have a small unburnt carbon shell lying on top of the neon shell as well .",
    "the hybrid core ( middle panel in fig.[fig : withov ] ) shows that a mild c burning is first ignited near the mass coordinate of @xmath47 and then propagates upwards until the first convective burning is initiated .",
    "the convective zone then disappears without any significant migration followed by a continuous c flame that propagates toward the centre .",
    "short bursts of convective burnings turn on and off as the conductive flame moves towards the centre .",
    "the flame dies out before reaching the centre .",
    "very mild burning then migrates upwards to the helium shell and is stopped short of reaching it .",
    "judging from the step - like increase in the @xmath46ne abundance as it moves towards the larger mass coordinates , the short episodes of convective burning appear to be more efficient further away from the centre than when they are closer to it .",
    "this can be explained by the increase in neutrino cooling as one moves towards the centre , making carbon burning less sustainable near the centre .",
    "finally , the bottom panel shows the case of a cbr factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the abundance profiles are representative of the one cores found in the run with a high abundance of @xmath46ne and a low abundance of @xmath44c throughout the helium free core .",
    "the evolution shows that convective c burning started off but fairly close to the centre and it was able to propagate all the way to the centre with minor interruptions .",

    "[ fig : mimf],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the ifmr is shown in fig.[fig : mimf ] . aside from the ifmr that branched up due to the earlier offset of carbon burning caused by the higher cbr , the behaviour of the ifmr here is nearly identical to that of its counterpart without convective boundary mixing in its helium - free core .",
    "the behaviour of the ifmr that branched off due to carbon burning is also very similar to that of its counterpart without convective boundary mixing .",
    "they do , however , branch off a little earlier , most noticeable in the runs with the cbr being 1000 times that of the standard rate .",
    "the possibility of the carbon flame being inhibited from propagating to the centre of a super - agb star was first suggested by siess in his study of the effects of thermohaline mixing on c - flames @xcite , however , without considering the implications on the wd composition .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that thermohaline diffusion coefficients based on hydrodynamic simulations imply mixing characteristics that do not quench the c flame .",

    ", we adopted convective boundary mixing for the c shell convection boundaries .",
    "boundary mixing outside of the helium - free core , however , was left in place to have identical evolution prior to possible c ignition .",
    "consistent with the earlier studies of c burning that did not account for convective boundary mixing or thermohaline mixing @xcite , all c burning convection zones in our simulations develop flames that propagate to the centre of the core in the absence of convective boundary mixing .",
    "mild c burning that does not initiate convection can neither propagate to a different location nor consume very much carbon .",
    "the composition of a co core that experiences this type of burning remains essentially unchanged .",
    "no hybrid core was produced in the runs without convective boundary mixing .",
    "thus , there exists a sharp boundary between the most massive co core and the least massive one core for a given cbr ( fig.[fig : ccm ] ) .",
    "the initial mass of the star that hosts these cores is anti - correlated with the cbr , as expected .    in the runs with convective boundary mixing the carbon flame quenching",
    "was found to be present in all the cores that were just massive enough to ignite convective carbon burning , regardless of their cbr .",
    "the flame quenching , however , can be overcome for higher initial and core masses of super - agb stars .",
    "incomplete burning resulting from the flame quenching has thus created a class of hybrid cores that has an unburnt co - rich core , surrounded by an one shell .",
    "the core masses of these hybrids are those of the lower mass one cores seen in the no convective boundary mixing case .",
    "the most important conclusion of our investigation with regard to the question of sn ia progenitors is twofold , depending on what level of convective boundary mixing is appropriate for c burning convection .",
    "if convective boundary mixing is zero , the hindrance model would imply that the initial mass for the formation of co wds is slightly increased and co core masses could be up to @xmath48 .",
    "the more interesting implication however is the possibility of unknown resonances that would increase the c burning rate and may lead to a decrease of the maximum initial mass to form co wds and limit the maximum co wd core mass to @xmath49 .    for the case",
    "in which a small amount of convective boundary mixing leads to the formation of hybrid c - o - ne wds the implications of the cbr uncertainties are more significant .",
    "if c - o - ne wds can ignite a thermonuclear runaway , the mass range of sn ia progenitor wds could increase significantly .",
    "hybrid wds that could form if the reduced hindrance cbr is appropriate could be as large as @xmath50 .",
    "such a large wd mass would make reaching the chandrasekhar limit much easier , since only a small amount of mass has to be accreted .",
    "in addition , the maximum initial mass in this case could be just in excess of @xmath51 .",
    "this would imply a significantly shorter sn ia delay time compared to the standard case .",
