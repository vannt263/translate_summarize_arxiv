    "as introductory remark , it is worth emphasizing some unique features of gamma - ray astronomy : the specific character of the emission processes , the diversity of the emission sites , and the penetrating nature of the emission .",
    "first , the emission process that leads to gamma - rays is in general very specific , and as such , is rarely observable in other wavebands . at gamma - ray energies , cosmic acceleration processes are dominant , while in the other wavebands thermal processes are generally at the origin of the emission .",
    "for example , electrons accelerated to relativistic energies radiate gamma - ray photons of all energies through electromagnetic interactions with nuclei , photons , or intense magnetic fields .",
    "accelerated protons generate secondary particles through nuclear interactions , which may decay by emission of high - energy gamma - ray photons . at gamma - ray energies , nuclear deexcitations lead to a manifold of line features , while in the other wavebands , it is the bound electrons that lead to atomic or molecular transition lines .",
    "for example , the radioactive decay of tracer isotopes allows the study of nucleosynthesis processes that occur in the deep inner layers of stars .",
    "the interaction of high - energy nuclei with the gas of the interstellar medium produces a wealth of excitation lines that probe the composition and energy spectrum of the interacting particles",
    ". finally , annihilation between electrons and positrons result in a unique signature at 511  kev that allows the study of antimatter in the universe .",
    "second , the sites of gamma - ray emission in the universe are very diverse , and reach from the nearby sun up to the distant gamma - ray bursts and the cosmic background radiation",
    ". cosmic acceleration takes place on all scales : locally in solar flares , within our galaxy ( e.g.  in compact binaries , pulsars and supernova remnants ) , and also in distant objects ( such as active galactic nuclei or gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "cosmic explosions are another site of prominent gamma - ray emission .",
    "they produce a wealth of radioactive isotopes , are potential sources of antimatter , and accelerate particles to relativistic energies .",
    "novae , supernovae and hypernovae are thus prime targets of gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "third , gamma - rays are highly penetrating , allowing the study of otherwise obscured regions .",
    "examples are regions of the galactic disk hidden by dense interstellar clouds , or the deeper , inner , zones of some celestial bodies , where the most fundamental emission processes are at work . new classes of sources become visible in the gamma - ray domain , that are invisible otherwise .    in summary",
    ", gamma - ray astronomy provides a unique view of our universe .",
    "it unveils specific emission processes , a large diversity of emission sites , and probes deeply into the otherwise obscured high - energy engines of our universe .",
    "the gamma - ray universe is the universe of particle acceleration and nuclear physics , of cosmic explosions and non - thermal phenomena . exploring the gamma - ray sky means exploring this unique face of our world , the face of the evolving violent universe .",
    "as a general rule , accretion in astrophysical systems is often accompanied by mass outflows , which in the high - energy domain take the form of ( highly ) relativistic jets .",
    "accreting objects are therefore powerful particle accelerators , that can manifest on the galactic scale as microquasars , or on the cosmological scale , as active galactic nuclei , such as seyfert galaxies and blazars .    although the phenomenon is relatively widespread , the jet formation process is still poorly understood .",
    "it is still unclear how the energy reservoir of an accreting system is transformed in an outflow of relativistic particles .",
    "jets are not always persistent but often transient phenomena , and it is still not known what triggers the sporadic outbursts in accreting systems . also , the collimation of the jets is poorly understood , and in general , the composition of the accelerated particle plasma is not known ( electron - ion plasma , electron - positron pair plasma ) . finally , the radiation processes that occur in jets are not well established .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a detailed analysis of the 511  kev line shape measured by spi has also provided interesting insights into the annihilation physics @xcite .",
    "at least two components have been identified , indicating that positron annihilation takes place in a partially ionized medium .",
    "this clearly demonstrated that precise 511  kev line shape measurements provide important insights into the distribution of the various phases of the interstellar medium ( ism)@xcite .",
    "while integral has set the global picture of galactic positron annihilation , high angular resolution mapping of the galactic bulge region is required to shed light on the still mysterious source of positrons .",
    "so far , no individual source of positron emission could have been identified , primarily due to the expected low levels of 511  kev line fluxes .",
    "an instrument with sufficiently good sensitivity and angular resolution should be able to pinpoint the origin of the positrons , by providing detailed maps of the central bulge region of the galaxy . with additional fine spectroscopic capabilities , comparable to that achieved by the germanium detectors onboard the spi telescope , the spatial variations of the 511  kev line shape will allow to draw an unprecedented picture of the distribution of the various ism phases in the inner regions of our galaxy .",
    "thus , with the next generation gamma - ray telescope , galactic positrons will be exploited as a messenger from the mysterious antimatter source in the milky - way , as well as a tracer to probe the conditions of the ism that are difficultly to measure by other means .",
    "gamma - ray line and continuum observations address some of the most fundamental questions of core - collapse supernovae : how and where the large neutrino fluxes couple to the stellar ejecta ; how asymmetric the explosions are , including whether jets form ; and what are quantitative nucleosynthesis yields from both static and explosive burning processes ?    the ejected mass of @xmath0ti , which is produced in the innermost ejecta and fallback matter that experiences the alpha - rich freezeout of nuclear statistical equilibrium , can be measured to a precision of several percent in sn  1987a . along with other isotopic yields",
    "already known , this will provide an unprecedented constraint on models of that event .",
    "@xmath0ti can also be measured and mapped , in angle and radial velocity , in several historical galactic supernova remnants .",
    "these measurements will help clarify the ejection dynamics , including how common jets initiated by the core collapse are .",
    "wide - field gamma - ray instruments have shown the global diffuse emission from long - lived isotopes @xmath1al and @xmath2fe , illustrating clearly ongoing galactic nucleosynthesis . a necessary complement to these are high - sensitivity measurements of the yields of these isotopes from individual supernovae .",
    "a future gamma - ray mission should determine these yields , and map the line emission across several nearby supernova remnants , shedding further light on the ejection dynamics .",
    "it is also likely that the nucleosynthesis of these isotopes in hydrostatic burning phases will be revealed by observations of individual nearby massive stars with high mass - loss rates .",
    "for rare nearby supernovae , within a few mpc , we will be given a glimpse of nucleosynthesis and dynamics from short - lived isotopes @xmath3ni , and @xmath4ni , as was the case for sn  1987a in the lmc .",
    "in that event we saw that a few percent of the core radioactivity was somehow transported to low - optical depth regions , perhaps surprising mostly receding from us , but there could be quite some variety , especially if jets or other extensive mixing mechanisms are ubiquitous .",
    "classical novae are another site of explosive nucleosynthesis that is still only partially understood@xcite .",
    "although observed elemental abundances in novae ejecta are relatively well matched by theoretical models , the observed amount of matter that is ejected substantially exceeds expectations .",
    "how well do we really understand the physics of classical novae ?",
    "radioactive isotopes that are produced during the nova explosion can serve as tracer elements to study theseevents .",
    "gamma - ray lines are expected from relatively long living isotopes , such as @xmath5be and @xmath6na , and from positron annihilation of @xmath7-decay positrons arising from the short living @xmath8n and @xmath9f isotopes .",
    "observation of the gamma - ray lines that arise from these isotopes may improve our insight into the physical processes that govern the explosion .",
    "in particular , they provide information on the composition of the white dwarf outer layers , the mixing of the envelop during the explosion , and the nucleosynthetic yields . observing a sizeable sample of galactic nova events in gamma - rays",
    "should considerably improve our understanding of the processes at work , and help to better understand the underlying physics .",
    "the major mission requirement for the future european gamma - ray mission is sensitivity .",
    "many interesting scientific questions are in a domain where photons are rare ( say @xmath10 ) , and therefore large collecting areas are needed to perform measurements in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "it is clear that a significant sensitivity leap is required , say 50100 times more sensitive than current instruments , if the above listed scientific questions should be addressed .",
    "with such a sensitivity leap , the expected number of observable sources would be large , implying the need for good angular resolution to avoid source confusion in crowded regions , such as for example the galactic centre .",
    "also , it is desirable to have an angular resolution comparable to that at other wavebands , to allow for source identification and hence multi - wavelength studies .    as mentioned previously , gamma - ray emission may be substantially polarized due to the non - thermal nature of the underlying emission processes .",
    "studying not only the intensity and the spectrum but also the polarization of the emission would add a new powerful scientific dimension to the observations .",
    "such measurements would allow to discriminate between the different plausible emission processes at work , and would constrain the geometry of the emission sites .",
    "taking all these considerations into account , the following mission requirements derive ( c.f .",
    "table [ tab : mission ] ) .",
    "the energy band should cover soft gamma - rays , with an extension down to the hard x - ray band to allow the study of broad - band spectra . at the same time , major gamma - ray lines of astrophysical interest ( i.e.  511  kev and 847  kev ) should be accessible .",
    "we therefore set our baseline energy range to @xmath11 kev .",
    "a real sensitivity leap should be achieved , typical by a factor of 50100 with respect to existing gamma - ray instrumentation . for high - resolution gamma - ray line",
    "spectroscopy a good energy resolution is desirable to exploit the full potential of line profile studies .",
    "a reasonably sized field - of - view together with arcmin angular resolution should allow the imaging of field populations of gamma - ray sources in a single observation . finally , good polarization capabilities , at the percent level for strong sources ,",
    "are required to exploit this additional observable .",
    "ll + parameter & requirement +   + energy band & 50 kev  2 mev + continuum sensitivity & @xmath10   + narrow line sensitivity & @xmath12   + energy resolution & 2 kev at 600 kev + field of view & 15 arcmin + angular resolution & arcmin + polarization & 1% at 10 mcrab",
    "+   +    how can these mission requirements be reached ?",
    "we think that the best solution is the implementation of a broad - band gamma - ray lens telescope based on the principle of laue diffraction of gamma - rays in mosaic crystals @xcite .",
    "the laue lens may eventually be complemented by a coded mask telescope or a multilayer - coated mirror telescope in order to achieve coverage in the hard x - ray domain .",
    "in addition , the lens detector may be designed in a compton configuration so that it could be simultaneously used as an all - sky monitor",
    ".      the key element of gri is a broad - band gamma - ray lens based on the principle of laue diffraction of photons in mosaic crystals ( von ballmoos and frontera et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) . each crystal can be considered as a little mirror which deviates s through bragg reflection from the incident beam onto a focal spot .",
    "although the bragg relation @xmath13 implies that only a single energy @xmath14 ( and its multiples ) can be diffracted by a given crystal , the mosaic spread @xmath15 that occurs in each crystal leads to an energy spread @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the crystal lattice spacing , @xmath18 the bragg angle , @xmath19 the diffraction order , @xmath20 the planck constant , @xmath21 the speed of light and @xmath14 the energy of the incident photon ) . placing the crystals on concentric rings around an optical axis , and the careful selection of the inclination angle on each of the rings ,",
    "allows then to build a broad - band gamma - ray lens that has continuous energy coverage over a specified band . since larger energies @xmath14 imply smaller diffraction angles @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : bragg ] ) , crystals diffracting large energies are located on the inner rings of the lens . conversely , smaller energies @xmath14 imply larger diffraction angles and consequently are located on the outer rings .",
    "a laue lens starts to become efficient from energies on where photon absorption becomes small within the crystals . for copper crystals and a minimum machinable crystal thickness of @xmath22  mm this energy",
    "is situated around @xmath23  kev . to cover a continuous energy band",
    ", the crystal energy bandpass @xmath24 should not be too small . since @xmath25 , the number of required crystal tiles increases considerably with decreasing energy , leading to a natural lower energy boundary ( also situated around @xmath26  kev ) where bragg reflection becomes inappropriate for photon concentration .    having these considerations in mind , we propose a broad - band laue lens covering the energy band @xmath27  kev  2  mev as the central element of gri .",
    "the lens is composed of a ring with inner and outer diameters of @xmath28  m and @xmath29  m , respectively , resulting in @xmath30  m@xmath31 of geometrical lens area .",
    "eventually , deployable lens petals may be added to reach even lower energies , and we actually are studying the technical feasibility of such a solution ( frontera et al . , these proceedings ) . owing to the small scatter angles of @xmath32 ( for the largest and smallest energies , respectively ) , the focal spot of the lens",
    "will be situated around @xmath33  m behind the lens .",
    "this implies that the detector which collects the concentrated gamma - rays will be situated on a second spacecraft .",
    "both spacecrafts fly in formation , but the precision constrains on the formation are not very severe . due to the small bragg angles ,",
    "the focal distance has only to be kept within @xmath34  cm in order to maintain the optimum performances of the instrument .",
    "the size of the focal spot is primarily determined by the size of the crystal tiles ( situated between @xmath35  cm@xmath31 and @xmath37  cm@xmath31 ) and the mosaic spread @xmath15 of the crystals ( 1 arcmin at a distance of 100  m corresponds to a size of 3  cm ) .",
    "thus the maximum allowed lateral displacement of the detector spacecraft with respect to the lens optical axis will be of the order of @xmath38  cm .",
    "considering the pointing precision , an accuracy of @xmath39  arcsec are sufficient to maintain the system aligned on the source .",
    "although the lens is basically a radiation concentrator ( with a beam size that corresponds to the crystal mosaicity , say @xmath28 arcmin ) , it has a substantial off - axis response . for sources situated off the optical axis",
    ", the focal spot will turn into a ring - like structure ( which is centred on the lens optical axis ) , with an azimuthal modulation that reflects the azimuthal angle of the incident photons .",
    "thus , the arrival direction of off - axis photons can be reconstructed from the distribution of the recorded events on the detector plane .",
    "the field - of - view of the lens is therefore basically restricted by the size of the detector . for a detector size of @xmath40  cm@xmath31 and a focal length of 100  m",
    "the field - of - view amounts to @xmath39  arcmin . within this field - of - view",
    "the lens can be used as ( indirect ) imaging device .",
    "the imaging performances are considerably improved by employing a dithering technique , similar to that employed for integral .",
    "it is important to notice that the small angle crystal diffraction that is exploited for gamma - ray focusing does not alter the polarization of the incident radiation . in other words ,",
    "a polarized gamma - ray beam will still be polarized after concentration on the focal spot , and the use of a polarization sensitive detector will allow for polarization measurements ( caroli et al . , these proceedings ) . in view of the expected polarization of non - thermal emission ,",
    "this aspect of gri opens a new discovery space which will considerably improve our understanding of the observed objects .    to take maximum profit of the gamma - ray lens ,",
    "we employ a position sensitive detector in the focal spot .",
    "our actual design studies are mainly focused on a pixelised stack of detector layers , which on the one hand has the required position sensitivity , and on the other hand can be exploited as compton telescope for instrumental background reduction .",
    "possible detector materials under investigation are cdte , czt , si , and/or ge ( caroli et al . and wunderer et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "although germanium would provide the best energy resolution ( and is certainly the preferred option for detailed studies of gamma - ray lines ) , the related cooling and annealing requirements may drives us towards other options .",
    "the detector configuration we propose ( a pixelised detector stack ) has the nice side effect that it can be employed as an all - sky monitor for soft gamma - ray emission ( wunderer et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "if used as a compton telescope , the detector will be sensitive to any direction of the sky that is not shielded by the satellite , providing thus an onboard capability to detect variable or transient sources .",
    "since we can not predict if an all - sky monitor will be available by the time that gri will operate , we think that an all - sky monitoring capability aboard gri itself is important to quickly react to targets of opportunity .",
    "we currently investigate technical details of such a solution .    in order to extend the gri energy coverage towards lower energies ( below @xmath27 kev )",
    "we also investigate the possibility to add a hard x - ray monitor to the mission .",
    "such a broad - band coverage would be crucial to better understand the physics of compact objects , which exhibit spectral variations over a wide energy band .",
    "in particular , the accurate determination of energy cut - offs will rely on an accurate determination of the broad - band spectrum of the object under investigation .",
    "two options are currently considered : a small multilayer - coated mirror telescope or a collimated coded mask telescope ( natalucci , these proceedings ) .",
    "theoretically , a multilayer - coated mirror promises an excellent sensitivity for hard x - ray astronomy , yet it is unclear up to which energies these capacities may be extended .",
    "the american nustar mission or the french - italian simbol - x mission plan to use mirrors up to energies of @xmath41  kev .",
    "potentially , even higher energies may be reached ( e.g.  christensen , these proceedings ) .",
    "alternatively , a collimated coded mask telescope may provide a good option for a hard x - ray monitor on gri . at energies",
    "@xmath42  kev the cosmic background radiation presents the most important source of photons , limiting severely the sensitivity of current wide field - of - view coded mask telescopes , such as ibis on integral or the bat on swift ) .",
    "collimation considerably reduced this background component , promising an interesting sensitivity increase at these low energies .",
    "we currently investigate the accommodation of a multilayer - coated mirror or a coded mask telescope on gri .",
    "the mirror could be inserted within the spare area ( @xmath28  m diameter ) inwards of the innermost crystal rings or in some specific area reserved on the lens area .",
    "analogously , the coded mask could have a ring - like shape , and could be fit within the innermost crystal rings ( natalucci , these proceedings ) .",
