    "deterministic filtering methods have been developed in the literature for linear and nonlinear systems as an alternative to stochastic techniques .",
    "they are especially applicable to situations where the noise characteristics are not stochastic and/or whose statistics are not known apriori . in such cases , the noise is typically modeled as an unknown process satisfying some bound in an @xmath0 or @xmath1 sense , where this may be interpreted as a generalization of an energy bound ; e.g. , see @xcite . in particular , the set membership state estimation approach in @xcite provides a deterministic interpretation of the kalman filter in terms of a set - valued state estimate , where the solution to the estimation problem is obtained by constructing the set of all possible states consistent with the given measurements . this set membership approach has been extended to estimation for nonlinear systems as presented in @xcite .",
    "most estimation schemes proposed for nonlinear systems both in the stochastic and the deterministic settings , use some kind of approximation schemes for the state dynamics which often consist of linearizing the state and measurement equations about a suitable operating point . indeed , this is not an issue for systems with small nonlinearities but the effect of nonlinearity induced errors needs to be considered for systems with large nonlinearities as presented in @xcite .",
    "another approach to nonlinear filtering that does not consider linearization of the underlying nonlinear dynamics is presented in @xcite using the max - plus machinery . there",
    ", the nonlinear filtering problem is recast into an optimal control problem leading to a hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation .",
    "we note that the approach taken in @xcite bears a resemblance to that here in that max - plus machinery was employed for value function propagation . in both cases , the value , as a function of the state variable is semiconvex , where the space of semiconvex functions is a max - plus linear space ( or moduloid ) , for which a countable set of quadratic functions forms a basis ( or spanning set ) .",
    "however , in the case of @xcite , the basis elements used in the max - plus value function expansion were fixed . here",
    ", we adopt a modification of the more recently developed curse - of - dimensionality - free approach , where that approach to infinite time - horizon control is adapted to the time - dependent filter value function propagation . that approach has been demonstrated to be highly effective from a computational standpoint in several applications @xcite .",
    "in particular , the quadratic functions used in the truncated max - plus expansion are boot - strapped by the algorithm .",
    "we note that , in order to maintain computational tractability with this approach , one employs a max - plus optimal projection at each time - step .",
    "this is optimally performed by pruning the set of quadratics in the representation @xcite .    in this paper , we present a set - valued state estimation approach to nonlinear filtering for systems with nonlinear dynamics and observations using min - plus methods to obtain the corresponding deterministic filter .",
    "the constraint on the system noise is described by a sum quadratic constraint ( sqc ) @xcite .",
    "a set - valued state estimation scheme is utilized to reduce the filtering problem to a corresponding optimal control problem in terms of an hjb equation .",
    "the optimization problem consists of computing the minimum quadratic supply needed to drive the system to a given terminal state subject to the sqc .",
    "the computations are achieved by applying a min - plus scheme to the optimization process where the solution operator is linear in the min - plus algebra . indeed",
    ", this scheme does not employ the linearization of the system dynamics and provides a less conservative solution in terms of the filter recursion equations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : problem - formulation ] describes the formulation of a nonlinear system with the noise bounded by an sqc .",
    "section [ sec : svse ] describes the set - valued state estimation scheme for nonlinear filtering , and recasts the nonlinear filtering problem into a corresponding optimal control problem .",
    "the solution to the optimal control problem using the min - plus linearity property and the corresponding filter recursion equations which arise therefrom are discussed in section [ sec : filter - equations ] .",
    "an illustrative example is presented in section [ sec : ex ] , and the paper is concluded with remarks on future research in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "the reverse - time system formulation is used to formulate and solve the filtering problem which is recast as a subsidiary optimal control problem using the hjb equation . for further details ,",

    "such a discretization can be achieved by using standard techniques such as the euler or higher - order runge - kutta methods @xcite . in particular , applying the euler scheme to in reverse time yields , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sampling time .",
