    "for the last fifty years , most of the activity on particle physics relied on the use of large particle accelerators .",
    "these devices , allowing the scientists to break matter down to its most elementary constituents , have been fundamental in helping particle physicist to reveal the secrets of matter .",
    "however , besides these high - energy experiments , low - energy experiments were also carried out , giving very important contributions , like the confirmation of parity violation in weak interactions .",
    "in fact , low - energy experiments always played a important role in particle physics .",
    "but now , the perspectives are that during the first decade of the next century the importance of low - energy experiments must increase significantly .",
    "until lhc collects enough data , the measurement of anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xcite and atomic parity violation ( apv ) in heavy atoms @xcite are going to be a source of significant new results @xcite .",
    "the measurement of apv in heavy atoms is one of the most important and ambitious low energy experiments being carried out .",
    "the aim is to achieve a @xmath0 accuracy in the measurement of the weak charge of cesium in the next few years .",
    "recently a new step was given in this direction , the weak charge of cesium was reported to @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 we must compare this result with the prediction of the standard model ( sm ) . including radiative corrections , it is conveniently expressed in terms of the oblique parameters as",
    ", @xmath3 were the hadronic - loop uncertainty has been included .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends on the top quark and higgs boson mass . for @xmath5 gev",
    "we have @xcite @xmath6 in the calculations hereafter we assume the @xmath4 given in eq .",
    "it is important to stress that our final conclusions are not going to depend in a significant way of @xmath4 dependence on the higgs mass . comparing the theoretical prediction and the experimental value of @xmath7",
    "we conclude that @xmath8 this result implies that the sm prediction and the experimental result are @xmath9 apart . from eq .",
    "( [ difference ] ) we see that the allowed range of variation for the total new physics contribution to the weak charge , @xmath10 , is @xmath11 at @xmath12 cl .",
    "this result is quite interesting .",
    "in fact , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be shown that taking seriously the new result for @xmath13 we can exclude the sm at @xmath14 cl .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors see no justification to believe that such discrepancy originates from some experimental or theoretical mistake .",
    "they suggest instead that the new value of @xmath7 may have been originated from the presence of some kind of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "this possibility has already been explored up to some extent in refs .",
    "@xcite , were it is shown that the observed deviation in @xmath7 can be explained by the presence of a new neutral gauge boson .",
    "leptoquarks and certain four - fermion contact interactions can also account for the present discrepancy @xcite .",
    "we point out that all these new contributions are at tree - level .",
    "no analysis was done considering the effects of new physics through one - loop effects . with the intention of filling partially this gap",
    "we analyze here if four - fermion contact interactions that do not contribute at tree - level , can lead to sizeable contributions to @xmath7 , through one - loop level diagrams .",
    "presently , the bounds on new physics are such that the new particles , if they exist , must be very heavy . under these conditions the effects of these new particles intermediating interactions involving four - fermions can be approximated as contact interactions . in the specific case of apv ,",
    "the contact interactions that can contribute at tree - level have the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the coupling constant , @xmath17 denotes an adequate combination of gamma matrices , @xmath18 is the spinor for the electron in the electrosphere , and @xmath19 corresponds to the spinor of a quark in the atomic nucleus .",
    "when we want to deal with one - loop effects we can consider more general expressions for the four - fermion interactions .",
    "we can consider scalar , vectorial , and tensorial interactions involving not only two leptons and two quarks , as shown above , but also interactions involving only quarks , or only leptons .",
    "in general , these interactions can be expressed in terms of the following lagrangians @xcite :    [ lag:4 ] @xmath20 \\ ;   \\left[\\bar{\\psi}_n \\left ( v_s^n - i a_s^n \\gamma_5 \\right ) \\psi_n \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{sca}\\ ] ] @xmath21 \\ ;   \\left[\\bar{\\psi}_n \\gamma_\\mu \\left ( v_v^n - a_v^n \\gamma_5 \\right ) \\psi_n   \\right]\\ ; , \\label{vec}\\ ] ] @xmath22\\ ;   \\left[\\bar{\\psi}_n \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } \\left ( v_t^n - i a_t^n \\gamma_5 \\right )   \\psi_n \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{ten}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the energy scale of the effective interaction , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real constants with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the lepton and quark flavors , and @xmath16 is the coupling constant which can depend on the fermion flavors",
    ". the parameter @xmath28 can assume the values @xmath29 in order to allow a constructive or destructive interference with the standard contribution for a given process .",
    "here we have assumed the most general four - fermion interactions , in which the new physics present at high energies must respect only a @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "such a choice allow us to parametrize not only interactions that respect the @xmath31 symmetry of the sm , but also , and more accurately , the interesting case of extensions based on extra @xmath30 symmetries .",

    "we take @xmath28 so that the final contribution for @xmath7 is positive , since negative contributions are completely excluded . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we have the value of @xmath10 considering a @xmath76 quark running in the loop , calculated separately for each possible quark in the nucleus and for the different channels , and for the sum of all contributions .",

    "the choice of the value of @xmath23 was based on the results of refs .",
    "we can see that the contributions are quite small because of the smallness of the @xmath76 quark mass .",

    "@xmath10 is of the order of magnitude of the expected correction and even if we assume that the different contributions in the first two columns and rows of table [ table2 ] interferes destructively instead of constructively , we have a result which falls into the interval in eq.([interv ] ) .",
    "the absence of good limits on the compositeness scale of @xmath86 interactions , involving at least one pair of heavy quarks , does not allow us to make for the @xmath67 vertex the same estimates we did for contributions to @xmath10 from @xmath87 interactions present in @xmath64 vertex .",

    "the results in table [ table3 ] show us that @xmath7 is reasonably sensitive to the presence of @xmath76 quark loops .",

    "as expected , @xmath7 is very sensitive to the presence of @xmath49 quark loops , as can be seen from the results in table [ table4 ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the previous analysis it is reasonable to assume that the new physics scale , @xmath23 , present in the @xmath47- and @xmath49-channel diagrams is the same , because the contact interactions come out of the exchange of the fermion constituents in a strong interaction regime .",
    "but , in the case we consider that massive bosons ( e.g. leptoquarks and @xmath95s ) are responsible for the contact interaction , this generally is not a valid assumption .",

    "considering that only @xmath89 or @xmath90 contributes to @xmath10 , we obtained the results shown in table [ table5 ] for @xmath33 being the top quark .",
    "we would get smaller allowed values in the case the contributions from the @xmath47- and @xmath49-channel were summed as well as if @xmath89 and @xmath90 contributed at the same time .",

    ", the resulting coupling constants must be unacceptably large .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath76 quark it should be of the order of @xmath104 , as expected in the compositeness scenario .",
    "in this article we investigated the one - loop effects arising from four - fermion contact interactions that do not appear in the standard model .",
    "we considered that no new physics contributes at the tree - level to the weak charge .",
    "this situation arises , for example , when the contributions from tree - level diagrams and @xmath94 quarks in the nucleus .",

    "interfere destructively ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this allow us to consider that the new physics is in a sense universal , affecting all quarks and leptons and yet not contributing to @xmath7 at tree - level .",
    "another possibility is that the new physics leads to negligible couplings among light quarks and leptons but sizeable ones in interactions involving heavy quarks .",
    "we estimated the effects of the contact interactions on @xmath7 analyzing the contributions to the vectorial and axial form factors .",
    "we concluded that four - fermion interactions containing the top quark can lead to sizeable contributions through @xmath64 and @xmath67 vertex , when fermion compositeness is assumed .",
    "four - fermion interactions that contains the bottom quark can also lead to sizeable results through the @xmath67 vertex if the compositeness scale is in the range of few hundred gev to 1 tev .",
    "the presence of new massive vectorial bosons , like @xmath105 and leptoquarks , can also explain the observed discrepancy in the measured value of the weak charge of cesium .",
    "they contribute to @xmath7 only at the one  loop level , and can be parametrized by four - fermion contact interactions . in this scenario",
    "also the top quark loops are the responsible for sizeable contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , it is not surprising that @xmath7 is very sensitive to top quark loops ; radiative corrections from the sm contributes with @xmath106 of the value in eq .",
    "( [ qwsm ] ) .",
    "we conclude by noting that in spite of the fact that our results are only approximate , for the very nature of the calculation of one - loop diagrams in effective interactions @xcite , we expect that the actual effects of new physics are not going to be far from what we have obtained .",
    "but we must be aware that cancellations among different one - loop diagrams may take place in actual theories , leading to non - observable effects .",
    "but our results suggest that one - loop effects of new physics may contribute significantly to the weak charge of cesium , leading to the observed discrepancy between sm prediction and the experimental determination .",
