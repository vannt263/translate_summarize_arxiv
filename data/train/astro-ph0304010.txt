    "the discovery of hypernovae , i.e. , supernovae ( sne ) with explosion energies exceeding that of normal sne , and possibly linked with gamma - ray bursts , has motivated the creation of a close network between transient - object hunters , follow - up observers , and model builders .",
    "this network successfully functioned for the recent energetic type  ic sn  2002ap , which appeared in the outer part of the nearby spiral galaxy m74 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8  mpc ; sharina , karachentsev & tikhonov 1996 ; sohn & davidge 1996 ) .",
    "after its discovery on january 29 by y. hirose and confirmation the following day ( nakano et  al . 2002 ) , intensive world - wide follow - up observational programs ( e.g. , gal - yam , ofek & shemmer 2002 ) were started , accumulating photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "theoretical models ( e.g. , mazzali et  al .",
    "2002 ) have been used to constrain the physical properties of sn  2002ap .",
    "having received notification of the rare opportunity of a nearby sn event soon after discovery , multi - wavelength monitoring of the brightness of sn  2002ap in the @xmath0 bands was started with the multi - color imaging photometer ( mip ) mounted on the magnum 2 m telescope ( yoshii et  al .",
    "2002 ) , which is located at a height of 3055 m at the summit of haleakala , on the island of maui , hawaii .",
    "the magnum ( ulti - color ctive alactic clei onitoring ) project was designed to monitor many agns at wavelengths from the uv / optical to the near infrared ( nir ) and to determine a redshift - independent distance to the agns from which the cosmological parameters could finally be determined ( yoshii 2002 ) .    in this paper , the full set of @xmath0 imaging observations of sn  2002ap taken during the first 40 days following its discovery until it disappeared because of solar conjunction , and then in june after it reappeared , is presented , including the first nir light curves .",
    "these light curves are analyzed and compared to those of the hypernovae sne 1998bw and 1997ef .",
    "the bolometric light curve , constructed for dates up to march 11 , and then combined with one point in june , is compared with that synthesized using theoretical models .",
    "the magnum telescope has a 2 m primary mirror and rithey - chrtien optics giving a field view of 33 arcminutes ( kobayashi et  al .",
    "the mip camera , installed at the focal point of the bent - cassegrain focus , contains an site ccd ( @xmath9 pixels , 0.277 arcsec / pixel ) and an sbrc insb array ( @xmath10 pixels , 0.346 arcsec / pixel ) .",
    "a dichroic beam splitter enables simultaneous imaging through optical ( @xmath11 ) and nir ( @xmath12 ) filters ( kobayashi et  al .",
    "the effective area of each frame over which the light was received by the detector is @xmath13 arcsecs for the ccd and @xmath14 arcsecs for the insb .",
    "observations of sn  2002ap are on the johnson - cousins system after correction for color - terms and color - offsets .    sn  2002ap ( @xmath15 , nakano et al .",
    "2002 ) was observed in the @xmath0 bands starting on february 2 and until march 11 , 2002 before solar conjunction .",
    "observations performed during june 2002 , the first month after solar conjunction , are also reported .",
    "given the inferred explosion date , january 28 ( mazzali et  al . 2002 ) , our observation began only 5 days after the explosion . a nearby star ( @xmath16 ) , known to be a double star , was of comparable brightness to sn  2002ap in the same ccd frame , so that it was observed as a reference star for @xmath11 .",
    "although sn  2002ap was only visible at low elevations ( @xmath17 degrees ) , either after sunset ( for the observations before solar conjunction ) or before sunrise ( for the observations after solar conjunction ) , mip s efficient splitting of the incident light allowed the successful completion of simultaneous multi - color imaging within an hour or so .",
    "because of such simultaneous imaging , telescope dithering required primarily for @xmath18 was also performed for @xmath11 using 3 10-arcsec steps .",
    "a typical exposure time for one step was 120 sec for @xmath1 , 40 sec for each of @xmath19 , and 10 sec for each of @xmath18 .",
    "however , for the observations in june , the exposure time was prolonged within the saturation limits of the reference star .",
    "typical seeing sizes of the stellar images were 1.0 - 1.7 arcsec in @xmath20 and 0.85 - 1.3 arcsec in @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "our observational strategy was to observe sn  2002ap , the infrared standard stars for @xmath18 ( hunt et  al .",
    "1997 ) and the optical standard stars for @xmath11 ( landolt 1992 ) , irrespective of whether the night was photometric or not .",
    "those observations were performed by interrupting the scheduled queue of our original program of observing agns . at the end of each night ,",
    "dome - flat images for @xmath22 and infrared dark images were obtained .",
    "however , twilight - flat images for @xmath1 were obtained on other days .",
    "image reduction was performed using our package of iraf - based automated reduction software ( magred ) , which was developed for the magnum project .",
    "a simple pattern of noises , which was overlayed on the images by interference from the radio broadcast station near the telescope site , was removed from the bias region of each ccd frame . then",
    ", for the ccd data reduction , nonlinear corrections , bias subtraction , flat fielding based on the dome flat ( twilight flat for @xmath1 ) , and interpolation among bad pixels were applied to each frame in a standard manner .",
    "sky subtraction was not employed because the difference between sky flat and dome flat was negligibly small except near the edge of each frame .    for the insb data reduction ,",
    "the noise pattern was removed from the image region of each frame , because the bias region is absent in the insb .",
    "then , similar corrections as above were made , but sky subtraction was done by using the sky flat taken at a time close to the observation of sn  2002ap .",
    "flat images for @xmath23 and @xmath21 were generated as the difference between the dome - flat images taken with the light on and off , after correcting for illumination by comparing with the sky flat .",
    "flat images for @xmath24 were taken similarly except that dark images were used instead of dome - flat images taken with the light off .",
    "multi - aperture photometry was used throughout , since sn  2002ap is located far from the center of m74 , in a region where the sky background is sufficiently flat .",
    "an aperture size of 11 arcsec was chosen as a compromise between smaller apertures which reliably increase the s / n ratio , and larger apertures which ensure constant and stable measured magnitudes of the reference double star . however , in order to enhance the s / n ratio , a smaller aperture was adopted for the @xmath1-band images taken on march @xmath25 ( 8.3 arcsec ) , and for the images taken in june ( 5.5 arcsec for @xmath19 and 8.3 arcsec for @xmath18 ) .",
    "three ccd frames of sn  2002ap were obtained each night while dithering the telescope position , and aperture photometry was performed for each frame .",
    "the adopted aperture magnitude of sn  2002ap is the median of the three .",
    "however , for the @xmath1-band frames taken after february 21 , the three frames were stacked before aperture photometry was performed .",
    "figure 1 shows a series of color - coded images taken on eight different nights ( february 2 , 4 , 8 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 22 , and march 5 ) , which give a visual impression of the optical color evolution of sn  2002ap .",
    "since each ccd frame is wide enough to cover both sn  2002ap and the reference star , the aperture magnitude of sn  2002ap was obtained via differential photometry between sn  2002ap and the reference star in the same ccd frame ( enya et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the magnitude calibration of the reference star in the ccd frame was carried out only on photometric nights , i.e. when the dispersion in instrumental magnitudes of sn2002ap and that for the reference star were comparable to the s / n ratio , and also when it was judged to be a fine day from the magnum cloud monitor data ( suganuma et  al . in preparation ) and by eye inspection of the weather . whenever optical standard stars were observed more than twice at different elevations on a photometric night , the airmass dependence and the magnitude zero points in each band were obtained , so that the aperture magnitudes of the reference star were calibrated .",
    "their respective medians and number of calibrations are @xmath260.04 , @xmath270.02 , @xmath280.01 , @xmath290.015 , and @xmath300.01 , where the error is estimated as half of the difference between the brightest and faintest magnitudes for multiple calibrations in each band .",
    "on the other hand , the insb frame of the @xmath18 observations is not wide enough to include any reference star of brightness comparable to sn  2002ap .",
    "therefore , the aperture @xmath18 magnitudes of sn  2002ap in individual image frames were calibrated using standards - based photometry , and for each band the median was adopted as the aperture magnitude of sn2002ap .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0 light curves based on the data taken on 14 nights during the period february 2 to march 11 , 2002 , until sn  2002ap disappeared behind the sun .",
    "these data are listed in table 1 , together with the data for 5 nights in june after solar conjunction . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "data reported by other authors are also shown in figure 2 .",
    "the magnitude error in each optical band is estimated as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the photometric errors of sn  2002ap and the reference star , respectively , which were estimated from the output of iraf phot , and @xmath34 is the magnitude calibration error of the reference star given in the previous section . for june data taken",
    "when sn  2002ap faded , the use of a small aperture for both sn  2002ap and the reference double star introduced some small error because of their different brightness profiles .",
    "this error was estimated to be 0.01 mag and was incorporated in the quadrature .",
    "the magnitude error in each nir band is estimated as @xmath35 , where @xmath32 and @xmath36 are the photometric errors of sn  2002ap and the standard stars , respectively , and @xmath37 is the zero - point uncertainty of the standard stars caused by time - variant atmospheric conditions .",
    "the error @xmath32 is basically given by the iraf magnitude dispersion of sn  2002ap divided by the square root of the number of frames obtained during the same night .",
    "however , since the error given this way is smaller than the standard deviation of the instrumental magnitudes of sn  2002ap , additional errors likely arising from the flat fielding and the reduction procedure must also be added in quadrature .",
    "we adopted @xmath38 mag because all standard stars were observed with enough s / n .",
    "we adopted @xmath39 mag for clear nights and 0.05 mag for poor conditions .",
    "the errors are larger when thin patchy clouds were present .",
    "the lines in figure 2 are fits to the data using cubic splines weighted by observational errors .",
    "larger weights were given to the @xmath11 fitting , while relatively small weights were given to the @xmath40 fitting .",
    "in this fitting procedure , we combined our own data ( filled circles ) with other @xmath41 and @xmath23 data ( open circles ) reported in the iaucs and gal - yam et al.s @xmath3 data ( crosses ) from the wise observatory .",
    "except for the @xmath3 band , where we have no data before february 14 , we could obtain light curves covering the entire period using only our own data .",
    "the date and magnitude of the epoch of peak brightness were determined from the spline curve for each of @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainty of the epoch of maximum was defined as the range of epochs when the magnitude is fainter than the peak magnitude by no more than 0.01 mag .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "these peak dates agree well with those derived previously by gal - yam et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    the wavelength - dependent slope of the declining part of the light curve , @xmath42 ( mag / day ) , was also determined .",
    "these results are also given in table 2 .",
    "bolometric light curves of sne are very valuable for constructing theoretical models .",
    "our photometric data , covering from @xmath1 to @xmath21 , enable us to build the bolometric light curve for sn  2002ap .",
    "for days when data in one or two bands are not available from magnum measurements , we interpolated the data taken on adjacent dates from magnum and other sources ( gal - yam et  al .",
    "2002 , iaucs and vsnet ) .",
    "first , all @xmath0 magnitudes were converted into absolute monochromatic fluxes .",
    "various sets of conversion factors for the standard system are available in the literature . as differences between these various sets are marginal , we adopted the values recently compiled by bessell ( 2001 ) .",
    "we adopted a combined galaxy - m74 reddening of @xmath43 , as determined from the  d equivalent widths in a high resolution spectrum ( takada - hidai , aoki & zhao 2002 ) , and a distance modulus @xmath7 , combining the estimates of sharina et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sohn & davidge ( 1996 ) from the brightest supergiants .",
    "monochromatic fluxes were then integrated over frequency with a cubic spline interpolation technique .",
    "those on february 8 are plotted in figure 3 as an example .",
    "we assumed zero flux at both integral limits , i.e. at the blue edge of the @xmath1 band and at the red edge of the @xmath21 band .",
    "the errors introduced by this assumption are much less than 10% .",
    "an early uv flux between 245 - 320 nm was measured with xmm - newton on february 3 ( soria & kong 2002 ) .",
    "extending the integration to this band , we found it contributes only 4% of the total flux .",
    "the nir flux , on the other hand , accounts for a significant fraction of the total flux , ranging from 20% on february 2 to 40% on march 10 , and being around 20% in june .",
    "this highlights the importance of @xmath18 photometry .",
    "uncertainty in the bolometric light curve also comes from the non - stellar nature of sn spectra , which are dominated by very broad lines .",
    "the true bolometric flux can only be obtained from spectrophotometry .",
    "we compared our results with the model uv - optical - nir spectrophotometry derived from the best - fit synthetic monte carlo spectra of mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and found that the differences between the two datasets are less than 0.2 mag . the total uncertainty in our bolometric light curve , including the uncertainty in the distance modulus , is therefore estimated to be @xmath44 mag .",
    "we list in table 3 our bolometric magnitudes , @xmath45 , along with the bolometric corrections , @xmath46 .",
    "they are shown in figure 4 as filled circles .",
    "we adopted an explosion date of january 28 ( mazzali et  al .",
    "we also plot the spectrophotometric point on january 30 as an open circle , and four unfiltered ccd magnitude points taken within 1 day of the discovery ( nakano et  al .",
    "2002 ; vsnet ) as crosses .",
    "these roughly define the very early phase of the bolometric light curve .",
    "the multi - band light curves of sn  2002ap are narrower than those of the well - studied type  ic hypernovae , sne  1998bw and 1997ef .",
    "this is shown in figure 4 , where the bolometric light curve of sn  1998bw ( patat et  al . 2001 ) , shifted down by 1.85  mag for the sake of comparison , and that of sn  1997ef ( mazzali et  al .",
    "2000 ) , are plotted as open circles and filled stars , respectively .",
    "the light curve of sn  2002ap declines more rapidly after peak , indicating that the trapping of @xmath6-rays released in the @xmath47ni@xmath48@xmath47co@xmath48@xmath47fe decays is less efficient in sn  2002ap , and that the radiation generated by trapped @xmath6-rays can escape more easily .",
    "this suggests that the ejecta of sn  2002ap are less massive .",
    "figure 4 also shows that sn  2002ap was about 1.8  mag fainter than sn  1998bw at peak , and about as bright as sn  1997ef .",
    "the brightness of the bolometric peak , @xmath49 mag , and its epoch , @xmath50 day 11 , are similar to those of sn  1994i ( nomoto et  al .",
    "this indicates that a similar amount of @xmath47ni , @xmath51 , was produced by the two sne , as suggested by theoretical models ( mazzali et  al .",
    "sn  2002ap is not as powerful an explosion as sn  1998bw , which ejected @xmath52 of @xmath47ni ( nakamura et  al .",
    "2001 ) , but rather more similar to sn  1997ef , which ejected @xmath53 .",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison of the colors of sn  2002ap with those of sn  1997ef . in the figure ,",
    "the time axes of sne  1998bw and 1997ef are compressed by a factor of 1.5 , which clearly shows that sn  2002ap evolves about 1.5 times faster than sne  1998bw and 1997ef in terms of colors .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding by kinugasa et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) that the evolution of the spectra of sn  2002ap proceeds at about 1.5 times the rate of sn  1997ef , which again suggests that sn  2002ap ejected less material than sne  1998bw and 1997ef .        in figure 6",
    "we compare the absolute @xmath54 light curves of sn  2002ap with those of the other four type ic sne with published nir photometry .",
    "these are sne  1983i ( elias et  al .",
    "1985 ) , 1983v ( clocchiatti et  al .",
    "1997 ) , 1994i ( rudy et  al .",
    "1994 ; grossan et  al .",
    "1999 ) and 1998bw ( patat et  al . 2001 ) . among these , the hypernova sn  1998bw stands out for being about 1.5 magnitudes brighter .",
    "the @xmath24-band light curve of sn 1983v is significantly broader than that of sn  2002ap , consistent with its designation as a `` slow '' type ic in the optical ( clocchiatti et  al .",
    "for the otherwise well - observed sn  1994i , there is only one data point in each of @xmath24 and @xmath23 , and two in @xmath55 .",
    "these show that the nir light curves of sn  1994i were probably much narrower than those of sn  2002ap .",
    "the data of sn  1983i seem to connect smoothly with those of sn  2002ap before day 50 and after day 130 , but this may be the result of our arbitrarily assigning the epochs .",
    "based on spectrum synthesis , mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) have proposed as a viable model for sn  2002ap the energetic spherical explosion of a c+o star , ejecting @xmath56 of material with a kinetic energy of @xmath57 .",
    "their favorite model is one with @xmath58 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is the explosion of a @xmath59 c+o star , leaving a compact remnant of mass @xmath60 , possibly a black hole .",
    "such a c+o star is formed in a he core of mass @xmath61 , corresponding to a main - sequence mass @xmath62 .",
    "the light curve obtained from this model , which is shown in figure 4 as a solid line , fits the bolometric light curve very well before day 50 .",
    "however , the model light curve deviates from the observations at later phases , lying 0.7 mag above the bolometric point in june .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath6-ray optical depth at later phases may be underestimated by the mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) model .",
    "a similar problem occurred in the case of sn  1998bw , where the models that best reproduce the observed light curve near the peak underestimate its brightness around day 150 ( nakamura et  al .",
    "2001 ) by @xmath63 mag .",
    "maeda et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) recently proposed a general parameterized two - component ejecta model and successfully reproduced the light curves of sne 1998bw and 2002ap at both peak and later phases .",
    "they suggested that the denser inner component introduced to increase the @xmath6-ray optical depth at later phases is the natural outcome of jet - driven hypernovae explosions ( maeda et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "hflich , wheeler & wang ( 1999 ) introduced aspherical but low - energy and low - mass ejecta to reproduce the light curve of sn  1998bw .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to find low - energy solutions , aspherical or spherical , for hypernova light curves by decreasing the mass of the ejecta , ( e.g. iwamoto et al .",
    "however , we must emphasize that it is the unusually broad spectral features that make hypernovae distinct from normal sne , and that these strongly require high kinetic energies in both spherical models ( iwamoto et  al 1998 ) and aspherical ones ( maeda et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether the low - energy model of hflich et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) can reproduce the broad lines in sn  1998bw .",
    "wang et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) also warned that very broad line features might have been observed in the spectra of other type ib / ic sne , so far classified as normal , if they had been observed at a time as early as sn 2002ap .",
    "obviously , future early observations are necessary to verify this speculation .    as for sn  2002ap ,",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) interpreted the weak polarization in sn  2002ap as due to an asymmetry ( @xmath64% ) in the ejecta .",
    "spectropolarimetry was also obtained by kawabata et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and leonard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at somewhat later epochs .",
    "their estimate of the degree of asymmetry is similar , and they discovered an intriguingly fast evolution of the polarization angle .",
    "our estimate of the kinetic energy of sn  2002ap may change if asymmetry is introduced . in the case of sn  1998bw , concentrating the kinetic energy along the line of sight led maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to reduce its value to @xmath65 . however , wang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that sn  2002ap is likely viewed near the equatorial plane , unlike sn  1998bw . in the aspherical models of maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , this would actually lead to a larger , not a smaller kinetic energy .",
    "in any case , we do not expect that the degree of asphericity , about 10%-20% , will significantly affect the global values derived in spherical symmetry .",
    "berger , kulkarni & chevalier ( 2002 ) claimed that the mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) model places some @xmath66  ergs kinetic energy at @xmath67  km  s@xmath68 , which is too large , considering the weak radio emission observed .",
    "we note , however , that mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) constructed their model by fitting the optical observations and hence the density structure they used only extended up to 60,000 km s@xmath68 .",
    "it is therefore not justified to extrapolate it to above @xmath67  km  s@xmath68 , where the material has too low a density to make an observable contribution to the optical spectra and light curves , except for polarimetry ( kawabata et  al .",

    "<S> supernova ( sn ) 2002ap in m74 was observed in the @xmath0 bands for the first 40 days following its discovery ( 2002 january 29 ) until it disappeared because of solar conjunction , and then in june after it reappeared . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes and dates of peak brightness in each band were determined . while the rate of increase of the brightness before the peak is almost independent of wavelength , the subsequent rate of decrease becomes smaller with wavelength from the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 band , and is constant at wavelengths beyond @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric evolution is faster than in the well - known `` hypernovae '' sne  1998bw and 1997ef , indicating that sn  2002ap ejected less mass . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric light curve of sn  2002ap for the full period of observations was constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute magnitude is found to be much fainter than that of sn  1998bw , but is similar to that of sn  1997ef , which lies at the faint end of the hypernova population . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric light curve at the early epochs was best reproduced with the explosion of a c+o star that ejects @xmath4 with kinetic energy @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the predicted brightness of sn  2002ap with that observed after solar conjunction may imply that @xmath6-ray deposition at the later epochs was more efficient than in the model . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to an asymmetric explosion . </S>"
