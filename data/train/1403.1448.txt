    "feynman path integral ( pi ) approach offers an intuitively welcome description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics @xcite , where classical mechanics emerges transparently from disappearing wave nature of particles along with vanishing planck constant . in pi approach",
    "the presentation of the quantum dynamics with a propagator also in stationary quantum states is transparent , in contrast with the conventional approaches , where time evolution is seen in the phase factor , only .",
    "however , working out analytical or computational solutions to practical problems becomes more demanding with pi @xcite , and obviously , this is one of the main reasons for path integrals not being a popular choice for considering quantum dynamics , not to mention the stationary quantum states .    for the above reasons the dynamical phenomena in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics are conventionally considered by searching or simulating solutions to the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "this is almost trivial for a single particle , but becomes laborious and needs a number of approximations with growing complexity in a many - body system . in contrast , with pi the many - body interactions are included transparently and exactly within numerical accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , the pi approach is rarely used outside quantum field theory or without monte carlo ( mc ) technique as the working horse .    however , it is worth mentioning that pimc has proven to be very successful in simulations of periodic imaginary time propagation of many - particle systems , which leads to the finite temperature equilibrium statistical physics description of the many - particle system in terms of mixed state density matrix @xcite . by treating all particles with the same pimc approach it is possible to evaluate the finite temperature electronic structure with exact account of many - body effects and beyond born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation as demonstrated , already @xcite .",
    "pimc is also robust enough to be used in various applications in nanoscience @xcite .    beyond the analytical solutions to stationary states or quantum dynamics , which are very few @xcite",
    ", numerical simulation of coherent real time propagation faces substantial challenges related to the interference of paths : how to choose or sample the relevant paths in a balanced way , i.e.  weighting the ones with most contribution through constructive interference and avoiding waste of efforts to those with negligible contribution due to destructive interference . in practice ,",
    "time evolution of the complex many - body wave function in a space with high number of dimensions leads to even higher dimensional path integrals , which obviously can be sampled efficiently with the monte carlo technique , only .",
    "there , the interference related slow convergence has been called as `` numerical sign problem '' @xcite or phase ( sign ) problem .",
    "sophisticated `` stationary phase weighting '' methods have been developed to overcome this without monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "there are still no preferable solutions to these problems , although many approaches and approximations for certain types of systems have been found @xcite .",
    "basically these methods rely on effective propagators @xcite with desired properties .",
    "they are relatively well behaving and use the advantageous features of the pi formalism , e.g. , reduction of the total system into two parts : the lower dimensional system of interest and the effect of an environment modeled with an influence functional @xcite .",
    "often , the effect of the environment can be approximated classically , leaving only a lower dimensional system to be inspected quantum mechanically .",
    "such methods have been shown to be successful in evaluation of the time evolution of a quantum  classical many - body systems @xcite for heavier particles than electrons .    since there is no perfect method for solving dynamical full quantum many - body problems in practice , it is useful to look at different methods , how they can be used , what are their strengths and weaknesses and what is needed in implementation of those methods .    in this paper",

    "time evolution of the probability amplitude , i.e. , the wave function @xmath11 in space @xmath0 can now be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 . from this relation the time dependent schrdinger equation can be derived @xcite , or alternatively , the time dependent wave function @xmath11 can be directly evaluated from the initial state @xmath14 , in case the kernel @xmath15 is known .    however , general explicit forms of the propagator are known for simple cases , only , such as the particle with mass @xmath16 in the one dimensional constant linear potential @xmath17 , @xmath18^{1/2 }       \\exp \\left[\\frac{{\\rm i}}{\\hbar}(\\frac{m}{2 t } ( x_b - x_a ) ^2 - \\frac{t}{2}(v(x_a ) + v(x_b ) ) - \\frac{t^3 f^2}{24 m } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduces to the free particle propagator with @xmath19 @xcite . for the one dimensional forced harmonic oscillator @xmath20 the exact explicit propagator takes the form @xcite @xmath21^{1/2 }       \\exp \\left [ \\frac{{\\rm i}}{\\hbar } s_{\\rm cl }   \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the classical action . for @xmath23",
    "this is @xmath24.\\ ] ]    for numerical approaches robust approximations are needed .",
    "it is advantageous that also in nontrivial forms of potential the propagation is straightforward to evaluate and with increasing numerical accuracy the propagator approaches the exact limit . with this in mind",
    "we discretize the time @xmath25 to a number of short steps @xmath26 .",
    "this is straightforward , because @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "this follows from additivity of action @xmath29 = s[b , c ] + s[c , a ] $ ] for any path @xcite .",
    "now , with a small @xmath26 the quantum paths can be expected to give the main contribution close to the classical path , for which @xmath30 is also small .",
    "this follows from the canceling kinetic energy @xmath31 contributions due to the destructive interference of paths in long path propagation .",
    "this presumes , of course , smooth enough potential @xmath32 , for which also the commutator @xmath33 $ ] is small .",
    "furthermore , for numerical approaches it is essential that the chosen discretization also converges to the exact formalism at the limit @xmath34 , and the faster the better for practical purposes .",
    "also , it is preferable that computational efforts are not wasted for computation of almost canceling contributions more than needed for the chosen target accuracy .",
    "now , eq .  ( [ linpropag ] )",
    "gives numerically useful approximation , which can be further simplified by neglecting the last term , cubic in @xmath35 , for short enough time steps .",
    "thus , we arrive at the symmetrized trotter kernel @xcite @xmath36^{d/2 } \\exp \\left[\\frac{{\\rm i}}{\\hbar}(\\frac{m}{2 \\delta t } ( x_b - x_a ) ^2 - \\frac{\\delta t}{2}(v(x_a ) + v(x_b ) ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the dimensionality of space .",
    "this propagator can also be found from the hamiltonian formulation @xcite . for a time independent hamiltonian @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the kinetic and potential energies , the propagator can be written as @xcite @xmath41 | x_a \\rangle = \\langle x_b | \\exp[-\\frac{{\\rm i}}{\\hbar}(t + v)\\delta t]| x_a \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "now , by using the zassenhaus formula @xcite @xmath43 = & \\exp\\left[-\\frac{{\\rm i } \\delta t}{\\hbar}t \\right ]   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{{\\rm i } \\delta t}{\\hbar}v \\right ] \\times \\\\   & \\times \\exp\\big\\ { \\left(\\frac{{\\rm i } \\delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 \\frac{[t , v]}{2 } \\big\\ }    o\\big\\ { 1 + \\left(\\frac{{\\rm i } \\delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)^3 \\big\\ }   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and by neglecting factors which approach one in the second order or higher in @xmath35 , as @xmath34 , and using the path integral formulation , we arrive at the approximation ( [ trottpropag ] ) .",
    "thus , this approximation is accurate almost to the second order in @xmath35 for a smooth potential with @xmath33 \\rightarrow 0 $ ] as @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , this is what the kernel in eq .",
    "( [ linpropag ] ) also suggests .    clearly , in numerical approaches it is the kinetic energy part , which brings in the challenges as @xmath45 , but as pointed out above , already , the resulting large momentum ",
    "short wave length oscillations of the propagator interfere destructively and should be damped out without wasting computational efforts .",
    "the potential energy part behaves the opposite way with respect to the time step , and becomes laborious only in case of large potential gradient at possible singularities in the potential function .",
    "we consider and test the trotter kernel eq .",
    "( [ trottpropag ] ) against the exact kernels eqs .",
    "( [ linpropag ] ) and ( [ harmfpropag ] ) in numerical simulations of one - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( odho ) and quantum well ( qw ) , both in stationary eigenstates and wave packet propagation .",
    "numerical evaluation of the integral eq .",
    "( [ propag ] ) is the core problem , here . for that",
    ", we span grids @xmath46 and @xmath47 for wave functions at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is practical to define the grid density profiles or distribution functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as ( possibly normalized ) inverse average grid spacing . with small enough time step",
    "@xmath35 we can assume the same restricted space @xmath52 for both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and for simple cases , also the same grid @xmath55 with the same size @xmath56 .    the simplest equally spaced regular grid , i.e. , with @xmath57 constant , between end points may generate fake constructive diffraction patterns .",
    "this is the diffraction grating effect , which can be removed out by increasing the grid size @xmath58 .",
    "usually , a better choice is some other regular distribution of @xmath57 , like gaussian or some other , related to the probability density or ( the absolute value of ) the wave function , itself .    of course , monte carlo grids with given distributions @xmath57 serve well , if smooth and sizable enough .",
    "there are methods for the analysis of `` smoothness '' of the distribution , such as kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test @xcite .",
    "in fact , with the increasing number of dimensions monte carlo grids may remain as the only practical choice . further smoothing and averaging out accumulative errors",
    "is attained with a continuous random change of the mc grids , within the predefined density profiles . for restricted range of dynamics , it may be practical to use identical distributions , i.e. , @xmath59 , but @xmath60 .",
    "ongoing random evolution of @xmath61 also means sampling of continuous space , instead of a discrete grid .",
    "this evolution can be adapted to follow the time evolution of the wave function or some related distributions like the absolute value or the probability distribution of the wave function , i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , for example .",
    "the distribution function @xmath65 appears as an inbuilt weight factor in the integration of eq .",
    "( [ propag ] ) . in the one - dimensional space it is straightforward to write @xmath66 , in terms of the cumulative distribution function @xmath67 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ propag ] ) becomes in form @xmath68 .",
    "for propagation over the time interval @xmath42 with @xmath69 , numerical calculation can be carried out as @xmath70    hence , it seems obvious that @xmath71 should decay faster than @xmath72 in order to avoid numerical instabilities . for real @xmath71 or for its absolute value this can be easily established , whereas for the two parts of complex @xmath71 this can be expected to be more tricky .",
    "the phase factor of calculated @xmath73 relates to the `` local total energy '' , and therefore , it serves as a good indicator of numerical stability .",
    "therefore , it seems possible to find phase factor based algorithms for stabilization of propagation and for removing numerical errors .    in principle , the distribution @xmath50 needs not to be known analytically , if @xmath74 can be evaluated from the wave function , for example .",
    "furthermore , negative sign can be assigned to @xmath50 at some range of @xmath75 , if relevant for some reason .",
    "monte carlo evaluation of expectation values of local operators , like the multiplicative potential @xmath76 , at time @xmath77 , can be done with @xmath78 where the operator can be time dependent , too .",
    "similarly , we calculate the total energy from @xmath79 where the local energy is evaluated from the increase in wave function phase @xmath80 within a time step @xmath35 as @xmath81 .",
    "then , the kinetic energy @xmath82 can be evaluated from @xmath83 .",
    "we first consider the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( odho ) , i.e. , a particle in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ harmpot ] ) with @xmath84 .",
    "thus , we have the time - independent potential @xmath85 we choose the parameters describing an electron in an atom size `` quantum dot '' to maximize the quantum effects and challenge for simulation of dynamics .",
    "we use atomic units , where @xmath86 , the last three being the charge , mass and bohr radius of the electron .",
    "this leads to the atomic unit energy of hartree , ha @xmath87 ev , which also defines the unit of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ harmopot ] ) .",
    "the atomic time unit becomes as @xmath88 s @xmath89 as .",
    "now , by substituting @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , we have the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath93 with equal contributions from kinetic and potential energies and eigenstates @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are hermite polynomials and @xmath96 . for the ground state we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 . the one - dimensional quantum well ( qw ) or `` particle in a box '' @xmath100 with @xmath101 is also used as a test case , where relevant . here",
    ", we have the free particle eigenstates with energies @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "first , we searched for numerical parameters , which keep the eigenstates stationary with an acceptable accuracy .",
    "the three lowest eigenstates of odho ( @xmath107 ) , eq .",
    "( [ harmopot ] ) , turn out to remain stable in a simulation with an even spaced grid of size @xmath108 in the domain @xmath109 with the time step @xmath110 .",
    "the potential energy expectation value ( [ exptv ] ) fluctuates around the time average @xmath111 with a standard deviation @xmath112 , and correspondingly , the total energy ( [ expte ] ) becomes as @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "thus , a small grid related error remains .",
    "we find that the time step should be small enough ( @xmath115 ) to justify the trotter approximation , eq .",
    "( [ trottpropag ] ) , for odho . shortening the time step",
    "calls for more accurate grid due to increasing kinetic energy , i.e. , oscillatory nature of the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ trottpropag ] ) .",
    "the potential energy contribution to phase oscillations is roughly two orders of magnitude less . in general",
    ", we found the maximum time step and even grid size proportion to be related roughly as @xmath116 for the trotter kernel , eq .",
    "( [ trottpropag ] ) .    the exact kernel eqs .",
    "( [ harmfpropag][harmpropag ] ) of odho , however , allows unlimited time step and the accuracy depends on the grid , only .",
    "even so , the time steps of a multiple of half oscillation period can not be used , because @xmath117 in the denominator causes divergence of both ( [ harmfpropag ] ) and ( [ harmpropag ] ) . with other time steps @xmath118 and @xmath108 the potential energy keeps correct in @xmath119 digits .",
    "the total energy @xmath120 becomes evaluated with same accuracy .",
    "for the qw with constant potential the trotter kernel is nearly exact @xcite .",
    "however , numerical accuracy suffers from inaccurate description of discontinuities of the potential function eq .",
    "( [ odpbpot ] ) at @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the accuracy is limited by the grid spacing @xmath122 . obviously for this reason",
    ", we found the time propagation to be somewhat unpredictable .    for this case",
    ", we found that the monte carlo grid with a constant distribution function to solves the problem .",
    "time evolution of the grid , with @xmath123 , samples the space continuously .",
    "we found the grid size @xmath108 sufficient for a stable simulation of the ground state in a qw @xmath101 with the total energy @xmath120 accurate in a few digits , for a few steps , already . obviously , other non divergent but adapted distributions @xmath65 will perform even better .",
    "next , we consider real time evolution of gaussian wave packet oscillation in the harmonic potential ( odho ) , above . as a test case",
    "we use the glauber state , also called coherent or quasi - classical state , because of classical like oscillation retaining the wave packet shape rigid .",
    "in fact , the width of the glauber state gaussian is that of the ground state , in the present case @xmath124 .",
    "the oscillation frequency is , of course , @xmath91 and period @xmath125 , for any oscillation amplitude @xmath126 .    with the trotter kernel and grid size @xmath127",
    "the time step dependence is small . with @xmath128 and starting from rest , the total energy is that of the first excited state , see fig .  1 .",
    "both @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and wave packet propagation of one period leads to potential energy error of @xmath131 , only . with the exact kernel , eqs .",
    "( [ harmfpropag][harmpropag ] ) , arbitrarily long time steps can be taken , except those , for which @xmath132 , as pointed out above .",
    "[ glauber ]",
    "with the path - integral approach , simulation of stationary eigenstates is no more trivial than that of explicitly time dependent wave functions . in both cases",
    "full propagation in the whole space needs to be similarly considered within each time interval .",
    "this points to the inherent nonlocality of the wave function and quantum phenomena , in general .",
    "an arbitrary pure quantum state can be expanded as a superposition of stationary eigenstates as @xmath133 and its time evolution in @xmath35 is @xmath134 c_k \\psi_k   $ ] . by using the small angle approximation for short enough @xmath35 , this can be written as @xmath135 c_k \\psi_k    $ ] .",
    "consider now stepwise decoherence of the wave function in each time step , that is driven by removal of the small imaginary part .",
    "such incoherent time evolution , @xmath136",
    "c_k \\psi_k , \\ ] ] converges to quantum zeno propagation at the limit @xmath34 , if the eigenstate is real .",
    "however , with a finite but short enough @xmath35 it increases the contribution of the eigenstate with smallest absolute eigenvalue with respect to the chosen reference energy , if @xmath137 for all @xmath138 . at the end",
    ", this state dominates and contributions from the other states die out .",
    "this is what we call incoherent propagation , here , and demonstrate the respective time evolution in odho with the trotter propagator in evenly spaced grid , see fig .  2 .",
    "incoherent evolution depends on the initial state as shown . in case where the ground state @xmath139 contribution is initially considerable , @xmath140 ,",
    "the convergence is fast .",
    "however , in case where initially @xmath141 , lowest of the states contributing to the initial wave function is found .",
    "the ground state is found only after a small seed of @xmath139 has been sown from numerical errors in propagation .",
    "finally , we consider accurate evaluation of the ground state , or another stationary state , after first finding it by the `` stationary state search '' described in the previous section . with the incoherent propagation in odho by using the trotter propagator we found accuracy of about five digits for the ground state energetics , independent of the grid size ( @xmath108 to @xmath142 ) and accidentally with the time step @xmath143 .",
    "obviously , there remains a systematic error due to the grid and propagator .",
    "therefore , we again employ the monte carlo grid to sample the continuous space .",
    "we also simplify the propagation , eq .",
    "( [ wfpropag ] ) , to increase accuracy in the spirit of diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) approach , where it is the distribution of walkers , which is the target ground state wave function .",
