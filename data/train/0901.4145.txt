    "energy loss for different combinations of ion specie , ion energy , and decelerating material has been measured since the early 20th century @xcite , with a corresponding development in theoretical work .",
    "calculations of ion energy loss , and hence range , are very frequently performed using variants of the bethe @xcite and bethe - bloch @xcite relations .",
    "experimental and theoretical developments have focused on making corrections to the original bethe relation to account for details of interactions with bound electrons and crystal structures at low energies @xcite , and quantum - mechanical limits to the transfer of energy under extreme relativistic conditions @xcite .",
    "the original bethe relation is still used widely , particularly when a reliable , approximate result is needed rapidly , or in the fairly wide range of energies where the bethe relation is adequately accurate @xcite .",
    "the bethe relation describes the stopping power : the rate at which a moving ion loses energy to the surrounding material .",
    "it is not trivial to use this relation to obtain the range of an ion , i.e. the distance for it to lose all of its kinetic energy . in practice",
    ", ion ranges are calculated using numerical integration in multi - physics computer programs , or from scaling laws normalized to the range for other energies or masses .",
    "however , reliance on sophisticated computer programs for infrequent calculations , without the ability to make a compact analytic estimate , can lead to errors .",
    "analytic solutions are also valuable for validating computer programs reproducing the same physics . here",
    "we point out analytic solutions to accurate approximations of the bethe relation , which can give good estimates of ion ranges in matter .",
    "in the continuous deceleration approximation , charged particles traversing matter lose kinetic energy @xmath0 at a rate depending on their instantaneous energy and the local material",
    ". expressed as the energy loss rate per distance traveled , the stopping power @xmath1 can be used to determine the range @xmath2 of the particle , by integrating the deposition until the particle is stationary : @xmath3 however , @xmath1 is expressed naturally in terms of @xmath0 rather than @xmath4 . rearranging ,",
    "@xmath5 the integral can be found numerically for arbitrary stopping powers , or analytically for stopping powers of sufficiently simple form .",

    "[ eq : range ] can be integrated numerically , though this is not straightforward because of a singularity at low energies .",
    "we have not found an analytic solution for the integral .",
    "@xmath16 can be expanded as a taylor series to make it more tractable for integration .",
    "this can be done for eq .",
    "[ eq : bethe ] with a relativistic expression for @xmath17 ; we do it also for a non - relativistic @xmath17 because the resulting integral is more amenable to subsequent manipulation .",

    "following the same procedure as above , we find that the non - relativistic form of each of @xmath16 and @xmath2 is simply the first term of the corresponding relativistic relation .",
    "for a target comprising multiple elements , the stopping power can be estimated from the combination of stopping powers from each element @xmath28 @xmath29  the bragg addition rule .",
    "this relation is approximate because of chemical bond formation , which alters the effective ionization . for ion energies much greater than the bond energies",
    ", the approximation should be accurate .",
    "expanding as before and gathering terms , the range can be expressed very similarly to that for single - element targets . in the relativistic case , @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the total electron density in the target .    in the non - relativistic case ,",
    "@xmath33 which is again simply the first term of the relativistic relation .",
    "although well - characterized numerical approximations to the exponential integral exist @xcite , they are not available as standard functions in mainstream computer languages , and require significant effort to implement from scratch .",
    "however , the logarithmic terms in the stopping power and range vary slowly compared with the powers of @xmath0 ; over wide ranges of energy , the stopping power can be approximated accurately by low - order polynomials .",
    "the use of polynomial approximations avoids the need to evaluate the exponential integral function .",
    "we define a stopping distance scale @xmath34 which is particularly well - behaved above the low - energy singularity as it tends to zero with @xmath0 , and increases monotonically ( fig .",

    "these solutions provide a convenient way to calculate ion ranges and energy deposition in regimes where the bethe relation is valid , i.e. kinetic energies of roughly 1 - 100mev / u , without depending on numerical integration .",
    "the use of a taylor series restricts the accuracy at high energy ; the relativistic expansion thus incorporates relativistic contributions to the range but is not valid to arbitrarily high energies .",
    "however , the analytic solutions can readily be used with more accurate formulations of the effective ionization .",
