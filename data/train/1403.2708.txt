    "we begin by summarizing the main results for the sis model in heterogenous networks without differential susceptibility .",
    "this will help us introduce the methodology and notation that we will use later , and will also help us compare known results with those obtained for networks when differential susceptibility is present .",
    "in the sis model individuals can exist in either of two possible states : `` healthy '' or `` infected '' .",
    "healthy individuals are infected when they come into contact with an infected individual with probability @xmath6 .",
    "infected individuals , on the other hand , become once again susceptible with a recovery probability @xmath7 .",
    "when each individual is in contact with @xmath8 others , the basic reproductive number of a homogenous network takes the form : @xmath9 where the superscript @xmath10 is used to indicate a homogenous network .",
    "@xmath11 can be interpreted as the average number of new infections that an infected individual generates during his infective period in a fully susceptible population .",
    "@xmath4 is the quintessential epidemiological parameter , since the infection can only spread when an infected individual gives rise to one or more new infected ( @xmath12 ) . because of this",
    ", a central question in epidemiology is under what conditions @xmath4 becomes greater than 1 .    in degree",
    "heterogenous networks with no degree - degree correlations and a degree distribution given by @xmath13 the basic reproductive number @xmath4 generalizes to @xcite @xmath14 ^ 2 \\right)\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath15 stands for uncorrelated networks , @xmath16 is the average degree of the contact network , @xmath17 is the average of the degrees squared and @xmath18 is the standard deviation of the degree distribution .",
    "note that when there is no heterogeneity , equation ( [ r0-uncorrelated ] ) reduces to equation ( [ r0-mixed ] ) , otherwise @xmath19 since @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , for highly heterogenous networks , where the degree distribution follows a power - law @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath18 ( and therefore @xmath4 ) grows with the network size , implying that the epidemic threshold vanishes for infinitely large networks ( @xmath4 is always larger than 1 ) . it is worth noting that this result was obtained using the heterogenous mean - field ( hmf ) theory , which neglects both dynamical and topological correlations .",
    "in hmf theory , the actual quenched structure of the network given by its adjacency matrix @xmath23 is replaced by an annealed version , in which edges are constantly rewired at a rate much faster than that of the epidemics , while preserving the degree distribution @xmath13 @xcite .    in most real world networks nodes",
    "are not connected randomly to other nodes , and this effect is characterized by what is known as non - trivial mixing patterns @xcite . in the case of degree",
    "heterogeneity these mixing patterns are captured by the conditional probability that a link starting at a node with degree @xmath8 will end at a node with degree @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . in this case",
    ", the basic reproductive number takes the form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the largest eigenvalue of the degree mixing matrix @xmath28 .",
    "while hmf theory assumes annealed networks , its validity for real ( quenched ) networks is limited @xcite .",
    "quenched networks are static , given by the adjacency matrix @xmath29 , where @xmath30 if there is a link connecting node @xmath31 to node @xmath32 and @xmath33 otherwise .",
    "a significant improvement over the hmf theory is given by the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory where it has been shown that the basic reproductive number takes the form @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath29 .",
    "next , we introduce differential susceptibility by assuming that the susceptibility probability @xmath36 is different for each node @xmath31 in the network .",
    "this generalization introduces an important conceptual difference in our interpretation of susceptibility . in models of homogeneous susceptibility @xmath6",
    "is interpreted as the probability that an infected individual passes on the disease to a susceptible individual , and hence , @xmath4 is interpreted as the average number of infected individuals begot by each infected individual in a fully susceptible population .",
    "this assumption of directionality is needed because one individual can infect many others , but can not be infected by more than one individual .",
    "when the fraction of infected individuals is small , however , @xmath6 can also be interpreted as the probability that an individual gets infected , since the probability that a susceptible individual is in contact with multiple infected individuals is negligible .",
    "biologically speaking , thinking of susceptibility in terms of the probability that a susceptible individual gets infected makes more sense than thinking of susceptibility in terms of the probability that an infected individual passes on the disease . because of this biological consideration , we flip the standard assumption and pin the variation in susceptibility to the susceptible individual .",
    "we note this approximation is valid only when the overall level of infection is low , which is the limit in which we derive our results .    after taking this consideration into account",
    "we proceed by following wang et al .",
    "@xcite and note that for an arbitrary network topology given by an irreducible non - negative adjacency matrix @xmath37_{n \\times n}$ ] , the evolution of the sis model can be written following as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the expected probability that node @xmath31 will be infected at time @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the probability that node @xmath31 receives the infection from at least one of its infected neighbors at time @xmath40 . the probability @xmath41 has the form : @xmath42 equation ( [ evolutionsis ] ) is a non - linear dynamical system in which the case of no infection in the network ( @xmath43 ) represents a fixed point of the system that becomes unstable when @xmath12 . to test for asymptotic stability ,",
    "we linearize the system ( [ evolutionsis ] ) around @xmath44 by removing all higher - order terms of @xmath39 : @xmath45 we note that here we have assumed no differences in the recoverability rate of individuals ( i.e. @xmath46 is constant ) .",
    "next , we express ( [ evolutionsis - linear ] ) in matrix form as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , m_{ij}=\\beta_i a_{ij } + \\delta_{ij}(1-\\delta)$ ] and @xmath49 is the kronecker delta .",
    "thus , one gets that the state with no disease is asymptotically stable if the largest eigenvalue of @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we note that when the origin is asymptotically stable , it is also globally stable , since @xmath52 where the second inequality follows directly from the weierstrass product inequality . using this , we see that the system satisfies the inequality @xmath53 thus , when @xmath51 , the infection will die out exponentially fast with a rate determined by @xmath54 .      the connection between the largest eigenvalue of @xmath50 ( @xmath54 ) and the epidemic threshold represents a solution of the system that has little practical use in absence of complete information about the network topology and the susceptibility of individuals . for the model to be of practical use we need to estimate @xmath54 when there is incomplete information about the topology of the network and/or the distributions of susceptibility probabilities of individuals .",
    "first , we note that the matrix @xmath55 where @xmath56 , r_{ij } = \\beta_i a_{ij}$ ] and @xmath57 is the identity matrix .",
    "therefore , we can define the threshold at which epidemics begin to spread through the largest eigenvalue of @xmath58 and generalize @xmath4 in equation ( [ r0-qmf ] ) to : @xmath59    to estimate @xmath60 when there is incomplete information about the system , we assume that @xmath61 is a random variable following an arbitrary distribution and use a mean - field approximation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the expected value of @xmath61 over all possible network realizations . in a network where the susceptibility @xmath36 is assigned independently of the topology , we have that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the expected value of @xmath66 given @xmath67 .",
    "then we obtain the basic reproductive number @xmath68    in the case of uncorrelated networks with heterogenous degrees , we relax @xmath63 to the expected number of links between nodes @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which is proportional to the product of the degrees of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . keeping arbitrary susceptibility probabilities and degrees , we have @xmath69",
    "since @xmath58 is an irreducible matrix , the eigenvector @xmath70 associated with the maximal eigenvalue @xmath60 is strictly positive . additionally , there are no other positive eigenvectors except positive multiples of @xmath70 . in this case , using the positive eigenvector @xmath71 $ ] with @xmath72 , one immediately obtains the maximal eigenvalue , and therefore the basic reproductive number @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the pearson correlation coefficient between the susceptibility @xmath36 and the square of the degree @xmath75 of individuals , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are their respective averages , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are their respective standard deviations . looking at equation ( [ eq : local_corr ] ) , we point out that even small correlations between the susceptibility and the degree can lead to significant over- or underestimation of @xmath4 when the variation in connectivity , as measured by @xmath79 , is large compared to the average connectivity @xmath80 , which is the for networks following a heterogenous degree distribution .",
    "we now focus on link level correlations , where the tendency of individuals to connect to other individuals with similar characteristics leads to non - trivial mixing patterns .",
    "we note that the same mathematical procedure can be used for the analysis regardless of whether we have correlations in susceptibility and constant recovery probability or vice versa .",
    "we consider link level correlations in the degree and the susceptibility of nodes . then we approximate @xmath61 with @xmath63 , by using the expected number of links from node with degree @xmath75 and susceptibility @xmath36 to node with degree @xmath81 and susceptibility @xmath82 .",
    "the expected number of links are proportional to the two - point conditional probability @xmath83 : @xmath84 to find the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath58 as defined by equation ( [ r - definition ] ) we need to find a positive vector @xmath85 $ ] such that @xmath86 holds for all @xmath31 .",
    "using some algebraic manipulations , we can rewrite equation ( [ rewrite1 ] ) : @xmath87   = \\frac{k_i \\beta_i } { n } \\sum_{k ' , \\beta ' } \\frac{p(k ' , \\beta ' | k_i , \\beta_i)}{p(k',\\beta ' ) } \\sum_{j , k_j = k ' , \\beta_j = \\beta ' } v_j\\ ] ] which holds for every @xmath31 . writing @xmath88 and summing these @xmath89 equations over @xmath31 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 which holds for every combination of @xmath8 and @xmath6",
    ". we can simplify equation ( [ rewrite3 ] ) further by writing @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath96 .",
    "in other words , the matrices @xmath58 and @xmath97 share the same eigenvalue .",
    "so , we will use @xmath95 as an approximation of the actual @xmath4 when there is limited information in the network : @xmath98 assuming d=@xmath99 is the number of different combinations of degree ( @xmath8 ) and susceptibility ( @xmath6 ) that a node can have in the network , we have compressed the entire information about the system ( network topology and the susceptibilities of nodes ) into a coarsened @xmath100 matrix . in fact , we can choose @xmath101 depending on how much information we have about the network .",
    "for example , we can assign each individual to one of @xmath102 degree classes , @xmath103 and to one of @xmath104 susceptibility classes , @xmath105 corresponding to low , average and high susceptibility respectively .",
    "we then only need to estimate the mixing patterns @xmath83 between the @xmath106 classes of individuals , as opposed to knowing every entry in the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "the more classes we have , the more mixing patterns we have to estimate and the closer @xmath95 will be to the actual @xmath60 .    moreover , if we assume independence between the degree of a node and its susceptibility , i.e. @xmath107 and choose @xmath108 where @xmath109 $ ] and @xmath110",
    "$ ] are the positive eigenvectors corresponding to the maximal eigenvalues @xmath27 and @xmath111 of the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath112 respectively , we can simplify equation ( [ rewrite4 ] ) : @xmath113 which gives @xmath114 and solves the system of equations . note that when there is no degree mixing , @xmath115 . on the other hand , when there are no mixing patterns in susceptibility , @xmath116 .",
    "equation ( [ rewrite4 ] ) allows us to estimate the basic reproductive number at different granularity depending on how much information we have about the network topology and the distribution of susceptibilities .",
    "however , from the scientific perspective it is still unclear how the different mixing patterns impact the spread of diseases . to push our understanding of the effect of differential susceptibility further we study the effects of segregation in the spread of diseases",
    ".      since the contact networks that underlie the spread of a disease are not only heterogeneous in terms of degree and susceptibility , but also segregated , we next proceed to solve the model for the cases where individuals are more likely to connect with others a similar level of susceptibility .",
    "as we will see , segregation can have an impact in the spreading of a disease that goes beyond the effects of differential susceptibility .    to understand the effect of segregation , we focus on the case where the degree of a node is independent of its susceptibility , @xmath114 , and look respectively , at the limiting cases when there is no segregation and maximal segregation .",
    "note that in the case of no segregation @xmath117 and the largest eigenvalue of @xmath118 is @xmath119 ( with eigenvector @xmath70 , @xmath120 ) , hence the basic reproductive number takes the form @xmath121 on the other hand , in the case of maximal segregation , where nodes only share links with nodes with the same susceptibility , @xmath118 is diagonal with @xmath6 s as the diagonal elements . in this case , @xmath111 is equal to the largest susceptibility in the system @xmath122 . thus , in the case of maximal segregation , the basic reproductive number becomes @xmath123 we note that in this extreme case nodes do not share links outside their susceptibility class , so the network is made of disconnected components .",
    "hence , @xmath12 implies a persistent infection in at least one of these components .",
    "we do want to stress that in general @xmath12 does not guarantee a macroscopic outbreak in the network , but the existence of a highly vulnerable pocket , or subgraph , where @xmath4 is above @xmath5 . in this case",
    ", the epidemic will be persistent , but will most likely remain contained .    to obtain general bounds for @xmath124",
    ", we use the collatz - wielandt formula @xcite , which states that the perron root of a matrix @xmath29 is given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 similarly , the min - max version states that @xmath127 where @xmath128 we rewrite the min - max and max - min versions of the collatz - wielandt formula into a form that we will use in the rest of the paper @xmath129 which holds for all non - negative non - zero vectors @xmath70 . assuming the matrix @xmath118 is irreducible , the perron root of @xmath118 coincides with the largest eigenvalue @xmath111 .",
    "thus , using equation ( [ eq : collatz ] ) , we can bound @xmath111 @xmath130 where @xmath131 $ ] can be any non - negative vector . choosing the vector @xmath70 such that @xmath132 in equation ( [ bound1 ] )",
    ", we immediately obtain the bound : @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the average susceptibility of the individuals connected to an individual with susceptibility @xmath135 .",
    "these bounds provide useful information to understand the potential impact of a disease under limited knowledge about the network topology .",
    "we note that weak segregation limits the variation of @xmath134 across the different susceptibility classes bounding @xmath4 in a small region around @xmath136 .",
    "strong segregation on the other hand , increases the gap between the bounds and our uncertainty for @xmath4 .    to extend our intuition",
    "further we consider a simple network model with tunable segregation . here , each node has the same degree @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the number of different susceptibility classes and @xmath141 $ ] models the segregation in the network .",
    "when @xmath142 , @xmath143 and the chances that a node will connect to others is independent of the susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "when , @xmath144 , segregation is maximal ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) and nodes share links only with others that have the same susceptibility . in this model , @xmath147 since all nodes have the same degree @xmath137 . to derive bounds for @xmath4 in this segregation model , we note that @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the kronecker delta .",
    "putting this into equation ( [ bound1 ] ) we have @xmath150 then choosing @xmath151 and using the fact that @xmath152 we have @xmath153 on the other hand , the lower bound for @xmath111 has the form @xmath154 where again @xmath131 $ ] can be any non - negative vector .",
    "note that if we choose @xmath155 if @xmath156 and @xmath33 otherwise , we get the lower bound @xmath157 \\leq \\lambda_{1,b}.\\ ] ] thus , we obtain the bounds for the basic reproductive number : @xmath158\\beta_{max } + 1 - \\delta \\leq r_0 \\leq \\left < k \\right > \\left[(1-s)\\left < \\beta \\right > + s \\beta_{max } \\right ] + 1 -\\delta.\\ ] ] fig .  [",
    "fig : segmodel]a shows the basic reproductive number @xmath4 as a function of the amount of segregation @xmath159 ( solid line ) along with the bounds given by equation ( [ segbounds ] ) ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we observe that as the amount of segregation increases , the network develops a highly susceptible pocket and @xmath4 tends to @xmath160 . this increase in vulnerability comes from highly susceptible groups of individuals that provide a stable pocket supporting the infection .",
    "the results show that segregation makes the network of individuals only as strong as its weakest subgroup .",
    "this suggests an immunization strategy that seeks to identify and target clusters of highly susceptible individuals , instead of groups of highly susceptible individuals that are connected to others that are less susceptible .    to illustrate the effects of segregation , we look at a real - world contact network of face - to - face proximity between students and teachers in a primary school @xcite . links between a and b denote the cumulative time spent by a and b in face - to - face proximity , over one day . for simplicity , we convert this daily network to an unweighted network by assigning a link between the pair of nodes that have spent more than 2 minutes of cumulative time in face - to - face proximity .",
    "after discretizing the links , we keep the largest connected component which consists of @xmath161 nodes .",
    "we then run a variation of the schelling s segregation process @xcite where initially each node is randomly assigned to one of two susceptibility classes .",
    "we use @xmath162 and assign high susceptibility nodes @xmath163 and low susceptibility nodes with @xmath164 , thus having only one parameter in the network , @xmath165 . to segregate this initial network , we assign to each node @xmath31 a potential energy @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the average susceptibility of @xmath31 s neighboring nodes . at each iteration",
    ", we swap a random pair of nodes if this decreases the total potential energy in the network . with each new iteration",
    ", we conserve the distribution of total susceptibility in the network but increase the level of segregation .",
    "[ fig : segmodel]b shows the increase of @xmath168 ( solid line ) with iterations of schelling s segregation process .",
    "the dashed line on the other hand shows the approximation @xmath169 when there is limited information in the network .",
    "the matrix @xmath97 is constructed by coarse - graining the network into 7 degree classes @xmath170 where each node is assigned to its nearest degree class and two susceptibility classes @xmath171 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we compute @xmath95 by estimating only @xmath172 entries of the matrix @xmath97 , as opposed to the @xmath173 entries of the matrix @xmath58 , which is a significant reduction in the amount of information we need about the system .",
    "[ fig : viz]a , 2b and 2c show the primary school network at three different iterations in the segregation process ; no segregation , mild segregation and high segregation respectively , with high susceptibility nodes colored red . fig .",
    "[ fig : viz]d shows the average fraction of infected nodes in the endemic state , @xmath174 , averaged over @xmath175 simulations , for different values of @xmath165 for the three networks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : viz]a , b and c. as we mentioned earlier , and as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : viz]d , segregation can change the shape of the epidemic curve and depending on the network topology , high @xmath4 does not necessarily lead to a high number of infected nodes in the endemic state .",
    "this can happen when there is extreme segregation and the infection is contained within a small number of highly susceptibility nodes that have no or little contact to the rest of the network . in practice , however , we often observe mild segregation which increases both @xmath4 and the number of infected nodes in the endemic state . finally , we compute the critical values of @xmath165 using equation ( [ r0-qmf - general ] ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : viz]d shows @xmath174 near these critical values along with the critical values ( horizontal dashed lines ) .",
    "in this paper , we extended the sis model to incorporate heterogenous susceptibility and showed that heterogeneity can significantly increase the networks vulnerability to diseases . for individual level correlations between the susceptibility and the degree of a node",
    ", we find that approaches using the average susceptibility of the system to approximate @xmath4 will over- or underestimate the potential spread of diseases .",
    "in other words , when there is variation in susceptibility , the increase in susceptibility of a few individuals is not necessarily compensated by the decrease in susceptibility of others , since the degrees and locations of these individuals play an important role . on the other hand , we found that when nodes with similar characteristics are more likely to be connected , the vulnerability of the network increases , since a small group of densely connected high - susceptible individuals can act as a pocket supporting a persistent infection . having a formula to compute @xmath4",
    ", however , has little practical use in absence of complete information about the network topology and the distribution of susceptibilities . in this case",
    ", we provided a method to approximate @xmath4 by coarse - graining the individual nodes into degree - susceptibility classes and only estimating the mixing patterns between these classes .",
    "going forward , it is important that mathematical models of epidemic spreading include the effects of heterogenous susceptibility to provide more accurate descriptions of epidemic spreading processes .",
    "otherwise , the basic reproductive numbers estimated from compartmental models will be systematically over or underestimated .",

    "<S> these results show that the failure to include differential susceptibility to epidemic models can lead to a systematic over / under estimation of fundamental epidemic parameters when the structure of the networks is not independent from the susceptibility of the nodes or when there are correlations between the susceptibility of connected individuals .    * beyond network structure : how heterogenous susceptibility modulates the spread of epidemics *   + daniel smilkov@xmath0 , cesar a. hidalgo@xmath1 , ljupco kocarev@xmath2 + * 1 the mit media lab , massachusetts institute of technology , cambridge , ma , usa + * 2 macedonian academy for sciences and arts , skopje , macedonia + * 3 biocircuits institute , university of california , san diego , ca , usa + * 4 faculty of computer science and engineering , university `` sv kiril i metodij '' , skopje , macedonia + @xmath3 e - mail : corresponding author : smilkov@mit.edu * * * *    the contact networks that underlie the spread of diseases , behaviors @xcite and ideas have heterogenous topologies @xcite , but also , exhibit heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals @xcite . in recent years the compartmental models used to study the spread of behaviors have been generalized to include the effects of network topology , but not the effects of both topology and differences in the susceptibility of individuals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generalizations including the network topology have revealed an intimate connection between the spectral properties of the contact network , and the basic reproductive number of infectious diseases , showing that for a network described by an arbitrary degree distribution the basic reproductive number of an infection ( @xmath4 ) , is proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the contact network s adjacency matrix @xcite . for highly heterogenous networks , </S>",
    "<S> this eigenvalue is always larger than @xmath5 meaning that network heterogeneity can reduce and even eliminate the existence of an epidemic threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> our understanding of the role of heterogeneous network topologies in epidemic spreading , however , has not been matched by a comparable development in our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals . yet , </S>",
    "<S> differential susceptibility , defined as the variation in the susceptibility of individuals is as widespread as network heterogeneity . for example , genetic conditions are known to cause heterogenous reactions to hiv @xcite , h5n1 influenza @xcite , and the encephalomyocarditis virus , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> differential susceptibility can also be the result of differences in age as it has been shown in the case of hantaan virus in mice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other mechanisms leading to differential susceptibility include previous disease history , obesity , stress , history of drug abuse , physical trauma or differences in healthcare quality , which could emerge from discriminatory practices or individual self - selection . </S>",
    "<S> the biological prevalence of differential susceptibility , therefore , invites us to ask whether relaxing the assumptions of homogeneous susceptibility has consequences for the spread of epidemics that are tantamount to the relaxation of assumptions of homogeneity in the connectivity of the contact network .    </S>",
    "<S> the incorporation of differential susceptibility into epidemic models , however , also introduces a new dimension to epidemic modeling , since there are multiple ways for individuals with differences in susceptibility to be arranged in a network . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the mixing patterns and segregation of populations @xcite imply that differential susceptibility can be structured through non - trivial correlations . </S>",
    "<S> examples here include schools , nursing homes and hospitals , where children , senior citizens and patients , who can be more susceptible to diseases , spend more time together . </S>",
    "<S> these mixing patterns imply that a complete study of differential susceptibility should consider not only variations in the susceptibility of individuals , but also the correlations between the susceptibility of individuals and the positions these occupy in a network .    understanding how epidemic spreading is affected by </S>",
    "<S> differential susceptibility can affect a number of policy decisions , since epidemic models do not only inform the spread of infectious diseases , but also the spread of behaviors @xcite , such as smoking @xcite ; health conditions , such as obesity @xcite ; and digital threats , such as computer and mobile phone viruses @xcite . here , however , we show that the failure to consider differences in the susceptibility of individuals can lead to over- or underestimate a network s vulnerability to epidemic spreading .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we solve the sis epidemic model for a contact network with arbitrary network topology and differential susceptibility and show that its basic reproductive number @xmath4 is proportional to the maximal eigenvalue of a topology - infection matrix that combines information on the topology of the network and the susceptibility of individuals . using mean - field theory , </S>",
    "<S> we look at individual level correlations between the susceptibility and the degree or connectivity of individuals and show that positive correlations between susceptibility and degree makes the network more vulnerable to epidemics ( increasing @xmath4 ) , whereas negative correlations make the network less vulnerable ( decrease @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally we look at segregation by studying the consequences of having individuals connected to other individuals with similar characteristics and show that segregation significantly increases the vulnerability of the network to disease  causing @xmath4 to increase . to conclude , we illustrate the strong effects of segregation dynamics on @xmath4 by running a variant of schelling s segregation process @xcite on a real - world contact network obtained from face - to - face proximity between students and teachers . </S>",
    "<S> this shows then even a mild level of segregation can drastically increase the critical reproductive number in a network where individuals differ in their susceptibility . </S>"
