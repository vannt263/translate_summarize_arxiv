    "let @xmath3 be an affine lie algebra and @xmath4 the index set of its dynkin nodes .",

    "let @xmath7 be the quantized enveloping algebra associated to @xmath3 without the degree operator . among finite - dimensional @xmath7-modules",
    "there is a distinguished family called kirillov - reshetikhin ( kr ) modules , which have nice properties such as @xmath8(@xmath9)-systems , fermionic character formulas , and so on .",
    "see for instance @xcite and references therein . in @xcite , assuming the existence of crystal basis @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) of a kr module we defined the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) sum @xmath12 where the sum is over @xmath13-highest weight vectors in @xmath14 with weight @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a certain @xmath17-valued function on @xmath18 called the energy function ( see e.g. ( 3.9 ) of @xcite ) , and conjectured that @xmath19 has an explicit expression @xmath20 ( see ) called the fermionic formula ( @xmath2 conjecture ) .",
    "this conjecture is settled in full generality if @xmath21@xcite , when @xmath22 for all @xmath23 if @xmath3 is of nonexceptional affine types @xcite , and when @xmath24 for all @xmath23 if @xmath25@xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that recently the existence of kr crystals for nonexceptional affine types were settled @xcite and their combinatorial structures were clarified @xcite .",
    "another interesting equality related to @xmath19 is the @xmath26 conjecture by shimozono and zabrocki @xcite that originated from the study of certain @xmath27-deformed operators on the ring of symmetric functions .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is of nonexceptional type .",
    "if the rank of @xmath3 is sufficiently large , @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath3 itself , but only on the attachment of the affine dynkin node @xmath0 to the rest of the dynkin diagram .",
    "see table [ tab : diamond ] .",
    "let @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) denote the 1-d sum for @xmath3 of kind @xmath30 .",
    "then the @xmath26 conjecture , which has been settled in @xcite , states that if @xmath31 , the following equality holds .",
    "@xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the set of partitions of @xmath35 whose diagrams can be tiled from @xmath30 , and @xmath36 is the littlewood - richardson coefficient .",
    "note also that @xmath37 in @xcite is related to our @xmath38 by @xmath39 .",
    "let us sketch out the proof in @xcite .",
    "since the 1-d sum depends only on @xmath30 , for each @xmath30 we choose @xmath40 such that @xmath41 for @xmath42 induces a dynkin diagram automorphism .",
    "namely , we choose @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "then on each kr crystal @xmath10 for @xmath45 one can show there exists an automorphism @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 for any @xmath42 , where @xmath48 is the kashiwara operator .",
    "this automorphism @xmath46 can be extended to the tensor product @xmath18 of kr crystals .",
    "let @xmath49 be the map sending an element @xmath50 of @xmath18 to the @xmath13-highest weight vector of the @xmath13-highest component containing @xmath50 .",
    "under the assumption that the rank is large , the composition @xmath51 has the following properties .    *",
    "the image of an @xmath13-highest weight vector can be regarded as an element for type @xmath52 . * for an @xmath13-highest weight vector @xmath50 for type @xmath52 of weight @xmath53 , the number of @xmath13-highest weight vectors of weight @xmath15 in the inverse image of @xmath50 is given by @xmath54 .",
    "* for an @xmath13-highest weight vector @xmath50 for @xmath45 , we have @xmath55 .    is a direct consequence of these properties .",
    "if we believe the @xmath2 conjecture , we have the right to expect exactly the same relation in the @xmath20 side under the same assumption of the rank .",
    "this is what we wish to clarify in this paper .",
    "namely , if @xmath3 is one of nonexceptional affine type and the rank is sufficiently large , we show the fermionic formula depends only on the symbol @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath56 , and if @xmath31 we have ( theorem [ th : m = k ] ) @xmath57 here @xmath58 is a datum such that @xmath59 counts the number of @xmath60 in @xmath18 and @xmath61 .",
    "the proof of proceeds as follows .",
    "we first rewrite the fermionic formula as @xmath62 by introducing the notion of stable rigged configuration .",
    "we then construct for @xmath31 a bijection @xmath63 where @xmath64is the set of littlewood - richardson skew tableaux of shape @xmath65 and weight @xmath66 .",
    "roughly speaking , the bijection @xmath67 proceeds as follows .",
    "when the rank is sufficiently large , there exists @xmath68 such that the @xmath69-th configuration @xmath70 is the same for @xmath71 . as opposed to the kkr algorithm that removes a box from @xmath70 starting from @xmath72 , we perform a similar algorithm starting from the largest @xmath69 .",
    "if we continue this procedure until all boxes are removed from @xmath70 for sufficiently large @xmath69 , we can regard this as a rigged configuration of type @xmath1 . reflecting this sequence of procedures",
    "we can also define a recording tableau , that is shown to be a littlewood - richardson skew tableau .",
    "this map can be reversed at each step , and therefore defines a bijection",
    ".    finally we show @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the first component of the image of @xmath75 by @xmath67 .",
    "we note that two equalities and together with the result of @xcite implies @xmath76 for @xmath31 and therefore settle the @xmath2 when @xmath3 is of nonexceptional type and the rank is sufficiently large .",
    "let us summarize the combinatorial bijections that are relevant to our paper as the following schematic diagram :    ( 25,8 ) ( 0,7)\\{type @xmath77 path } ( 0.3,0)\\{type @xmath77 rc } ( 3,3.2)(0,1)3 ( 3,4.2)(0,-1)3 ( 1,3.5)(b ) ( 15.3,0)\\{type @xmath78 rc } @xmath79 lr ( 15,7)\\{type @xmath78 path } @xmath79 lr ( 20,3.2)(0,1)3 ( 20,4.2)(0,-1)3 ( 20.5,3.5)(a ) ( 10,0.2)(1,0)5 ( 11,0.2)(-1,0)5 ( 10,0.7)@xmath67    here  path \" stands for the highest weight elements of @xmath80 and  rc \" stands for the rigged configurations .",
    "our bijection @xmath67 , that exists when the rank is large , corresponds to the bottom edge .",
    "bijection ( a ) , which we call type @xmath78 rc - bijection , is established in full generality in the papers @xcite .",
    "algorithms for bijection ( b ) are known explicitly in the following cases :    * @xmath81 type paths for all nonexceptional algebras @xmath77 @xcite , * @xmath82 type paths for @xmath83 @xcite , * @xmath84 type paths for all nonexceptional algebras @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "for the cases that the bijection ( b ) is established , our bijection @xmath67 thus gives the combinatorial bijection between the set of type @xmath77 paths and the product set of the type @xmath78 paths and the littlewood - richardson skew tableaux .",
    "we refer to @xcite for related combinatorial problems .",
    "we expect that the bijection ( b ) exists in full generality even without the large rank hypothesis . it will give a combinatorial proof of the @xmath2 conjecture .",
    "furthermore , it also gives an essential tool for the study of a tropical integrable system known as the box - ball system ( see e.g. , @xcite ) which is a soliton system defined on the paths and is supposed to give a physical background for the @xmath2 identities .",
    "more precisely , the rigged configurations are identified with the complete set of the action and angle variables for the type @xmath78 box - ball system @xcite ( see @xcite for a generalization to type @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that by introducing a tropical analogue of the tau functions in terms of the charge @xmath86 , the initial value problem for the type @xmath78 box - ball systems is solved in @xcite .",
    "therefore the construction of the bijection ( b ) in full generality will be a very important future problem .",

    "let us apply lemma [ lem : delta-1_rig ] in this situation .",
    "then all rows that are added by @xmath150 corresponding to all letters of the group @xmath171 remain as singular rows .",
    "recall that , by definition of @xmath160 , the letter @xmath23 of the group @xmath173 is located on the same row or lower row of @xmath8 compared with the letter @xmath23 of the group @xmath171 . to begin with",

    "this completes the induction step thereby finishing the whole proof of theorem [ psi-1_weldef ] .",
