    "at distances in the range of about @xmath17 to @xmath18 , the sculptor group is among the nearest galaxy groups beyond the local group @xcite .",

    "ngc  55 and ngc  300 are medium - sized spiral galaxies of type sb(s)m and sa(s)d , respectively @xcite .",

    "we therefore adopt a distance of @xmath6 for ngc  300 throughout this paper .",
    "early imaging of ngc  300 was carried out by @xcite using the 64-m parkes radio telescope .",
    "they determined an mass of @xmath24 and a total mass of @xmath25 from the rotation curve under the assumption of a distance of @xmath6 .",
    "they also noticed that the velocity field of ngc  300 appears strongly distorted which they attributed to the gravitational influence of a large cloud to the south - east of the galaxy .",

    "while @xcite assumed that these clouds were associated with ngc  300 , there has been a long debate over the past decades whether they might instead be fragments of the magellanic stream that runs across the same part of the sky ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a more detailed image of ngc  300 was obtained by @xcite with the twin - element interferometer of the owens valley radio observatory . at a much higher angular resolution of @xmath57 half - power beam width",
    "they were able to derive a detailed radial velocity map of the inner part of the galaxy . by fitting a tilted ring model to the velocity field",
    "they were able to describe the distorted velocity contours of ngc  300 as a result of varying inclination and position angle across the disc .",
    "the rotation curve obtained by @xcite from the tilted ring model is basically flat beyond a radius of about @xmath58 with a turnover velocity of @xmath59 at @xmath60 radius .",

    "unfortunately , the synthesis images obtained by @xcite and @xcite did not reveal the extent and structure of the outer disc of ngc  300 due to insufficient field of view and lack of sensitivity .",
    "we therefore decided to obtain deep observations of a large field of @xmath0 around ngc  300 in a mosaic of 32  pointings with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",

    "finally , section  [ sect_summary ] gives a summary of our results and conclusions .",
    "the observations of ngc  300 were carried out in late 2007 and 2008 with the six 22-m antennas of the australia telescope compact array .",
    "five of the antennas are moveable along an east - west track with a total length of @xmath63 , whereas the sixth antenna is fixed and separated by another @xmath63 from the western end of the track .",
    "the total observing time of @xmath64 was equally divided among the ew352 and ew367 array configurations to improve baseline coverage . because of the large spatial separation between antenna  6 and all other antennas in these configurations we only used data from antennas  1 to  5 in our analysis .",
    "the resulting minimum and maximum baselines were @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "ngc  300 was simultaneously observed in the 21-cm line emission of neutral hydrogen @xcite and in 21-cm radio continuum emission , using the two independent frequency chains of the atca . for the observations we used a bandwidth of @xmath67",
    "centred at a frequency of @xmath68 .",
    "the resulting velocity coverage is about @xmath69 with a channel separation of @xmath70 and an effective velocity resolution of about @xmath71 .",
    "the radio continuum data were obtained over a bandwidth of @xmath72 centred at @xmath73 .",
    "only the data will be discussed in this paper .    in order to map a large field of about @xmath0 ( corresponding to a projected size of about @xmath74 ) we covered ngc  300 with a large mosaic of 32 separate pointings .",
    "adjacent pointings were separated by @xmath75 which corresponds to approximately half the half - power beam width of the atca antennas at a wavelength of @xmath76 .",
    "the geometry of the entire mosaic is outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig_mosaic ] .",
    "the integration time per pointing in each array configuration was @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting spectral rms noise level at @xmath70 channel separation is about @xmath78 per beam which is equal to the theoretical noise level .    at the beginning of each observing run",
    "we spent about 15 to 20  minutes on the atca s standard flux calibration source , pks  1934@xmath79638 , which was used for bandpass and flux calibration of the data .",
    "every 45  minutes during our observing runs we integrated for 5  minutes on our gain amplitude and phase calibrator , pks  0008@xmath79421 , which has a @xmath80 flux of about @xmath81 and a separation from ngc  300 of about @xmath82 .",

    "the data were reduced and analysed with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; @xcite ) , the multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display ( miriad ) software package @xcite , and the groningen image processing system ( gipsy ; @xcite ) in a combined approach .",
    "we first used the task atlod to read the raw data into aips for the purpose of flagging bad pixels in the time - baseline domain using the interactive task spflg .",
    "next , we imported the flagged data into miriad .",
    "the flagging table produced by aips was then applied via the miriad task fgflag before proceeding with some additional flagging of shadowed antennas , absorption in the primary calibrator , pks  1934@xmath79638 , and otherwise corrupted visibilities .",
    "we then carried out the standard data reduction procedure , making use of miriad s dedicated mosaicking capabilities which include automatic corrections for primary beam attenuation .    for the image cube and beam we applied a robust weighting of visibilities with a robustness parameter of zero .",
    "the resulting synthesised beam is elliptical with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath4 and a position angle of @xmath85 with respect to north .",
    "furthermore , we employed a pixel size of @xmath86 in the image domain and a resolution and channel separation of @xmath3 through hanning smoothing in the spectral domain .",
    "the resulting spectral rms noise level is @xmath87 per beam , corresponding to a @xmath1 column density sensitivity of @xmath88 per spectral channel .",
    "this translates into a @xmath1 mass sensitivity of @xmath5 at a distance of @xmath6 .        to reduce the impact of beam sidelobes caused by our incomplete aperture synthesis we subsequently deconvolved the image data cube using the clean algorithm originally developed by @xcite .",
    "we actually applied the steer clean algorithm @xcite implemented in the miriad task mossdi with a flux density cutoff of @xmath89 per beam equivalent to about three times the rms noise level at @xmath3 channel width .",
    "individual channel maps of the final data cube are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_chanmaps ] .",
    "the zeroth , first , and second moment maps of ngc  300 were calculated using the aips task momnt . for this purpose , we first multiplied the data cube with the theoretical gain across the mosaic to obtain a data cube with a constant noise level at all positions and frequencies .",
    "next , we created a mask from the data cube by hanning - smoothing the frequency axis over three channels , convolving the spatial dimension with a gaussian of 5  pixels fwhm , and then masking all pixels in the smoothed cube that had a flux density value of less than @xmath90 per beam . in momnt ,",
    "only those pixels of the original data cube that had not been masked in the smoothed cube were used in calculating the moment maps .",
    "finally , the moment maps were divided again by the gain model to recover the original gain levels across the mosaic .",
    "there are several ways of determining the mean radial velocity of an line , including the calculation of the first moment of the spectrum , the fitting of one or more gaussian functions to the spectral line , or simply by using the velocity of the peak of the line .",
    "the impact of these and other methods on the outcome of rotation curve fits was studied in detail by @xcite based on a sample of galaxies observed as part of the nearby galaxy survey ( things ; @xcite ) .",
    "they found the most suitable method to be the fitting of gauss  hermite polynomials @xcite with an additional skewness parameter , @xmath91 , to the spectral lines .",
    "the fitting function used by @xcite and implemented in the gipsy task xgaufit is a modified gauss ",
    "hermite polynomial including only the zeroth- and third - order terms , namely @xmath92 with the substitution @xmath93 .",
    "the free parameters of the fit are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and the aforementioned skewness parameter , @xmath91 . the advantage of using gauss ",
    "hermite polynomials instead of pure gaussian functions is that the former will account for asymmetries in the line profile that can be characterised by @xmath91 . in our analysis",
    "we used the position of the maximum of @xmath97 to derive the radial velocity field .",
    "the total column density map of ngc  300 , derived from the zeroth moment of the data cube , is shown in fig .  [ fig_coldens ] .",
    "the disc appears to be significantly more extended than the optical disc and shows a clear separation into an inner and outer disc .",
    "the inner disc is characterised by high column densities of @xmath98 and appears to be aligned with the stellar disc .",
    "in contrast , the outer disc has lower column densities of typically @xmath99 and is spatially much more extended .",
    "furthermore , the transition between the inner and outer disc seems to go along with a systematic twist resulting in very different orientation angles of the two discs .",
    "this twist is also evident in the radial velocity map in fig .",
    "[ fig_coldens ] and the position - velocity diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_posivelo ] .    owing to our large mapping area and sufficiently high sensitivity ,",
    "this is the first time that the entire extent ( down to a column density level of about @xmath2 ) of the disc of ngc  300 has been revealed in such detail . within the @xmath2 column density level",
    ", the major axis of the disc of ngc  300 spans slightly more than @xmath9 on the sky which is equivalent to a linear diameter of about @xmath10 .",
    "earlier observations of ngc  300 with the vla by @xcite revealed only a small part of the outer disc , mainly due to the insufficient size of their mosaic of only five pointings .    the integrated spectrum of ngc  300 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_intspec ] . the total flux derived from our atca data is @xmath100 .",
    "the corresponding total mass of ngc  300 amounts to @xmath101 under the assumption that the gas is optically thin .",
    "since this will not be the case in the dense inner regions of the disc , the derived mass must be considered a lower limit .",
    "in addition , some of the diffuse flux of ngc  300 will not have been picked up by the atca due to the lack of sufficiently short telescope baselines .",
    "the effect of missing short spacings and the inability of clean to recover all the flux is visible in the channel maps of fig .",
    "[ fig_chanmaps ] , with the emission sitting in a slightly negative bowl .",
    "the mass determined from the parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ; @xcite ) is slightly larger with @xmath102 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* scaled to a distance of @xmath6 ) .",
    "this indicates that some flux is missing in our atca observations , although not much . on the other hand",
    ", hipass suffers from inaccurate bandpass calibration resulting in serious artefacts near bright and extended sources , and the true mass of ngc  300 could even be somewhat higher than the one determined by @xcite .",
    "the total mass of @xmath103 determined by @xcite from their vla observations ( again scaled to a distance of @xmath6 ) is significantly smaller , mainly reflecting the limited size of their mosaic on the sky and possibly the lack of short telescope baselines .",
    "we can also try to assess how the mass is distributed between the inner and outer disc of ngc  300 . by simply defining a column density boundary of @xmath104 between the two disc components we obtain masses of @xmath46 and @xmath105 for the inner and outer disc , respectively .",
    "hence , a significant fraction of the mass is within the extended outer disc .",
    "a closer inspection of the column density distribution reveals a certain degree of asymmetry in the disc .",
    "the south - eastern edge of the disc is rather clean and sharp , whereas the north - western edge looks more frayed and less well defined .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_nhiprofile ] showing the column density profile across ngc  300 as a function of declination offset ( i.e.  along a line of constant right ascension passing through the centre of the galaxy ) .",
    "there is a distinctive plateau in the southern part of ngc  300 followed by a sudden and steep drop in column density towards the southern edge of the disc . in the northern part ,",
    "in contrast , we observe a steady exponential decline without any obvious plateau or drop .",
    "the velocity dispersion map of ngc  300 , derived from the fitting of gauss  hermite polynomials to the spectra , is shown in the lower - right panel of fig .  [ fig_coldens ] .",
    "velocity dispersions across the inner disc are variable and somewhat higher than in the outer disc with typical values in the range of about @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "in contrast , the outer disc appears homogeneous with dispersions of just under @xmath108 in most areas ( equivalent to just over @xmath109 fwhm for gaussian line profiles ) .",
    "these values are not atypical for the warm neutral medium of the milky way @xcite and indicate an upper limit on the order of @xmath110 for the gas temperature",
    ". the true gas temperature may be well below this upper limit , as effects such as turbulent motion and beam smearing will contribute to the observed line width .",
    "are due to galactic foreground emission that was not deconvolved .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the systemic velocity of ngc  300 of @xmath111 ( equivalent to @xmath112 in the barycentric reference frame ) . ]",
    "[ fig_dispersion ] reveals regions of increased velocity dispersion near the boundary between the inner and outer disc , in particular on the north - eastern side of the galaxy .",
    "the highest dispersions of about @xmath109 are found along a filament in the eastern part of ngc  300 .",
    "such high values can no longer be explained by thermal line broadening alone , as in that case gas temperatures of about @xmath113 would be required .",
    "instead , the high velocity dispersion suggests the presence of different gas components along the line of sight as supported by the spectra shown on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersion ] .",
    "the spectra were extracted from the locations of highest dispersion marked with a and b in the map and reveal a clear double line profile at the boundary between the inner and outer disc .",
    "apparently , each disc component produces a separate line component in the spectrum , and the transition between the inner and outer disc is not gradual but abrupt within the size of our synthesized beam .",
    "this is also suggested by the radial velocity field as indicated by the white contours in fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersion ] . in the transition region between the inner and outer disc",
    "we observe a strong discontinuity in the velocity field .",
    "the resulting kinks in the velocity contours coincide precisely with the regions of increased velocity dispersion in the map , thus confirming our impression of an abrupt transition between the inner and outer disc of ngc  300",
    ".     column density sensitivity of about @xmath2 . ]",
    "interestingly , the transition from the inner disc to the outer disc is less sharp on the south - western side of ngc  300 where the velocity contour lines are much smoother , and  despite a slightly increased velocity dispersion  the spectra do not exhibit a double - peak profile .",
    "instead , there is a gradual transition from the inner to the outer disc component in the spectrum across several beam widths .          in order to determine the rotation curve , @xmath114 , of ngc  300 we must assume a model for the three - dimensional kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "one of the simplest and most commonly applied models is to assume that the gas particles move in circular orbits along tilted rings with varying position angle , @xmath115 , and inclination , @xmath116 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , each ring is assigned a position , @xmath117 , and systemic velocity , @xmath118 , both of which can also be allowed to vary .",
    "we used the gipsy task rotcur to fit a tilted ring model to the radial velocity field of ngc  300 as derived from the fitting of gauss  hermite polynomials to the spectral lines .",
    "we fitted 20  rings with radii ranging from @xmath119 to @xmath120 ( @xmath121 to @xmath13 ) in steps of @xmath122 .",
    "each ring was chosen to be @xmath122 wide to match the angular resolution of our data .",
    "data within an angle of @xmath123 around the minor axis of ngc  300 were excluded from the fit , and all data were weighted with the cosine of the position angle , @xmath124 .",
    "we first derived the position of the centre of ngc  300 from an optical @xmath125-band image taken with the mpg / eso 2.2-m telescope at la silla @xcite .",
    "ngc  300 has a very distinct , point - like core that is thought to be associated with either a nuclear stellar cluster or even a central black hole @xcite and should therefore provide us with an accurate position of the dynamical centre .",
    "a gaussian fit to the optical core revealed a central position of @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the j2000.0 coordinate system .",
    "next , we ran rotcur with the optically derived central position fixed and the gas expansion velocity also fixed to a value of @xmath128 .",
    "all other parameters ( systemic velocity , rotation velocity , position angle , and inclination angle ) were still left as free parameters .",
    "after the first run of rotcur we determined the systemic velocity by averaging over the fitted systemic velocities of all rings .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath129 in the lsr frame , corresponding to @xmath130 in the barycentric reference frame , was then used and kept fixed in all subsequent runs .",
    "this result is consistent with the barycentric velocity of @xmath131 found by @xcite based on hipass .",
    "next , we ran rotcur again with only the rotation velocity , position angle , and inclination angle left as free parameters .",
    "we followed the approach described by @xcite and first fixed the radial position angle profile .",
    "to reduce the initial bumpiness of the position angle profile we smoothed it by applying a boxcar filter with a width of @xmath132 ( equal to three radial bins ) to the position angle solution .",
    "after the next run of rotcur we also smoothed and fixed the inclination angle profile using the same boxcar filter as for the position angle . with all other parameters fixed , we then ran rotcur for the last time to obtain the final solution for the rotation curve .    our final rotation curve of ngc  300",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rotcur]a and table  [ tab_parameters ] . a comparison between the observed and modelled velocity fields is presented in fig .  [ fig_velofield ] .",
    "due to the combination of a large field of view with a fairly compact array configuration we are able to determine the rotation curve out to an angular radius of @xmath120 equivalent to a physical radius of @xmath13 . this is a significant improvement compared to the previous measurement with the very large array ( vla ) by @xcite which covered a radius of only @xmath133 .",
    "the rotation curve derived by @xcite is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_rotcur]a for comparison . within their uncertainties",
    "both rotation curves agree quite well , although a direct comparison is difficult due to the different resolutions of the vla observations and the atca observations presented here . at a higher resolution of @xmath134 fwhm",
    ", the rotation curve of @xcite shows small - scale variations not present in our atca rotation curve . in addition",
    ", there is some discrepancy in the very inner region of @xmath135 which is most likely caused by different degrees of beam smearing in combination with a rapid change in rotation velocity in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "hence , our atca observations in particular are not capable of reliably defining the rotation curve of ngc  300 across the inner @xmath136 .",
    "the derived rotation curve of ngc  300 rises out to a radius of about @xmath137 to @xmath138 ( equivalent to @xmath139 to @xmath133 ) where we observe a maximum rotation velocity of @xmath140 at @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) .",

    "@xcite derived similar values in the range of @xmath146 to @xmath147 at a radius of @xmath60 ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "beyond about @xmath15 the rotation velocity gradually decreases to below @xmath149 .",
    "this decrease was not seen in the previous vla data of @xcite due to insufficient radial extent of their map .",
    "a particular problem of rotation curve fits in general is the determination of uncertainties .",
    "the statistical errors of the fit , as provided by rotcur , are usually much smaller than the actual uncertainties of the solution which are dominated by systematic errors such as non - circular motion of the observed gas , insufficient spatial resolution of the observations , effects of varying optical depth , etc .",
    "there are two possible ways to obtain more reliable estimates of the uncertainties .",
    "one possibility is to determine the standard deviation of velocities along each tilted ring from the mean value of the rotation velocity for that ring .",
    "this provides us with a more realistic assessment of the true deviations of the observed velocities from the model .",
    "the error bars of our final rotation curve presented in fig .  [ fig_rotcur]a have been determined by this method .",
    "another possibility is to derive the rotation curve for the approaching and receding side of the galaxy separately and assess the differences between the two curves .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rotcur]b where the approaching and receding curves are compared to the overall rotation curve .",
    "the fits for the approaching and receding sides are independent from the overall rotation curve fit , as we derived separate solutions for the position angle and inclination .",
    "the two rotation curves both show a clear maximum and then decrease again at larger radii .",
    "the position of the maximum as well as the overall shape of the rotation curve , however , differ substantially between the approaching and receding side .",
    "these discrepancies indicate systematic uncertainties of up to @xmath150 for the overall rotation curve of ngc  300 .",
    "the rotation curve of the receding side continually decreases after reaching a maximum at @xmath151 , whereas the curve derived from the approaching side also decreases but then flattens out at larger radii .",
    "in addition , the approaching side has its rotation curve maximum significantly further inward at @xmath152 .",
    "these differences indicate a high degree of asymmetry in the kinematics of the gas disc of ngc  300 , some of which is immediately evident from the velocity map in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_velofield ] .",
    "the results indicate that the finding of a decreasing rotation curve in the outer disc should be approached with caution because non - circular motions and asymmetries in the disc could have contributed significantly to the observed velocity field of ngc  300 .",

    "we also show the originally fitted values before applying the boxcar filter for smoothing and the separate solutions for the approaching and receding side of the galaxy .",
    "the position angle is constant over the entire inner disc of ngc  300 with @xmath155 for @xmath156 . beyond the edge of the inner disc the position angle of the gas disc gradually changes by about @xmath157 only to become constant again in the very outer disc with @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath153 reflects the visual impression of a twist in the disc of ngc  300 and suggests the presence of two distinct gas discs , each with its own spatial orientation .",
    "the variation in inclination , @xmath154 , with radius appears less regular .",
    "the inclination of the gas disc increases from about @xmath157 to just over @xmath160 within the inner @xmath55 ( @xmath161 ) and then gently decreases again to @xmath162 in the outermost regions of the disc .    the observed decrease in rotation velocity",
    "is strongly coupled with the characteristics of the inclination angle in the outer parts of the disc .",
    "a smaller inclination angle would result in a higher rotation velocity . in order to obtain a flat rotation curve ,",
    "the inclination angle of the outermost tilted ring would need to be about @xmath163 .",

    "this is consistent with the kinematic inclination from the tilted ring model .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the maximum rotation velocity occurs near the transition radius between the inner and outer disc .",
    "a closer inspection of the rotation curves derived for the approaching and receding sides of ngc  300 ( fig .  [ fig_rotcur ] ) reveals that the position of maximum rotation velocity is closely linked to strong variations in inclination angle at that particular radius .",
    "it is possible that part of this variation in inclination is an artefact caused by the failure of the tilted ring model to cope with the sudden transition between the inner and outer disc .",
    "consequently , the decrease in rotation velocity across the outer disc of ngc  300 could be less pronounced than indicated by the tilted ring model .",
    "after having determined the overall rotation curve , we can now try to derive mass models of ngc  300 using the gipsy task rotmas .",
    "this will allow us to study the radial distribution of the different visible and dark matter components in ngc  300 and assess how much dark matter is required to explain the rotation curve .",
    "for this purpose , we assume the presence of three mass components , namely a gaseous disc , a stellar disc , and a dark matter halo .",
    "rotmas will attempt to fit the velocity curves of these three components to the total rotation curve : @xmath167 the factors @xmath168 and @xmath169 are mass scaling factors for the stellar and gaseous disc , respectively .",

    "all three dark matter halo models result in reasonably good fits .",
    "the goodness of fit of the pseudo - isothermal halo model is somewhat lower compared to the burkert and nfw halo models .",
    "the lower performance of the pseudo - isothermal halo is mainly due to its @xmath172 density profile at large radii . as a consequence",
    ", the velocity curve will continue to increase and eventually converge to a parameter - dependent constant , @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , the pseudo - isothermal halo model can not explain the decreasing rotation curve of ngc  300 , whereas the burkert and nfw halo models ( both with an @xmath174 behaviour ) are doing better .",
    "of course , all three halo models produce a lower reduced @xmath175 in the case of free stellar and gas mass scaling factors .",
    "whereas for the pseudo - isothermal and nfw haloes the improvement is significant , the burkert halo is the only model to produce a good fit with fixed mass scaling factors . in the case of free mass scaling factors we obtain values in the range of @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "fixing the gas mass scaling factor to @xmath178 yields somewhat smaller stellar mass scaling factors of @xmath179 .    as the stellar mass scaling factor",
    "strongly depends on the assumptions made about the stellar mass - to - light ratio of ngc  300 , a higher value of @xmath168 can arise from differences in star formation history or metallicity compared to the standard spiral galaxy model found by @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the best mass model fit for ngc  300 found by @xcite yields @xmath180 ( relative to our stellar disc mass of @xmath181 ) , and his maximum - disc model has @xmath182 .",
    "@xcite derive somewhat larger values of @xmath183 and @xmath184 for their best - fitting and maximum - disc models , respectively .",
    "these numbers are all in general agreement , but they also expose the uncertainties in the determination of the stellar mass - to - light ratio and the total stellar disc mass of ngc  300 .",
    "the free mass scaling factors for the gaseous component are somewhat higher than expected . a factor of  2 can still be explained by optical depth effects in the inner regions of the gas disc , significant amounts of ionised gas throughout the disc , or missing flux in our map due to lack of short interferometer spacings .",
    "gas mass scaling factors of  4 or  5 , however , seem unreasonably large and not realistic .    note that in the very inner region of ngc  300 the value of the rotation velocity of the gas disc is negative ( see fig .  [ fig_massmodels ] ) .",
    "this does not imply counter - rotation of the gas or the presence of negative mass , but simply reflects a net outward force on test particles due to the central depression of the gas disc .",
    "this net outward force results in a negative value of @xmath185 and therefore an imaginary velocity in the mathematical description of mass models that is usually expressed by negative values of @xmath186 .",

    "apart from the significantly larger @xmath192 compared to all of the dark matter models with free mass scaling factors , the mond model results in a considerable downscaling of the gas disc mass .",
    "this is an implausible result because the derived gas mass surface density was directly derived from the observed column densities and must therefore be a lower limit .",
    "fixing the mass scaling factor for the gas disc to a value of @xmath178 slightly reduces the stellar mass scaling factor to @xmath193 , the goodness - of - fit parameter , however , significantly deteriorates to @xmath194 .",
    "the reason for the inferior performance of mond is the decrease in rotation velocity at larger radii .",
    "mond has been designed to explain the flat rotation curves originally observed in many galaxies .",
    "therefore , the model will fail in cases of decreasing rotation curve .",
    "consequently , deep observations with the aim to detect the faint , outer gas discs of galaxies have the potential to challenge mond through the detection of decreasing rotation curves in the outer regions of many more galaxies .",
    "it should be noted , though , that  as discussed earlier  the observed decrease in the rotation velocity of ngc  300 is uncertain due to the possibility of non - circular motions and asymmetries in the disc .",
    "deep studies of a much larger sample of spiral galaxies will be required to investigate the frequency of occurrence of decreasing rotation curves in these galaxies .",
    "the newtonian scenario without dark matter also fails to produce meaningful results .",
    "the best fit again has a large @xmath195 .",
    "in addition , both the stellar and gaseous disc masses would have to be scaled up significantly by scaling factors of @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively . such large scaling factors , in particular for the gas disc , are highly implausible .",
    "of course , fixing the gas mass scaling factor to @xmath178 does not produce any meaningful result at all , because the remaining free stellar mass component dramatically fails to reproduce the overall shape of the rotation curve , resulting in a @xmath192 of @xmath198 .        in summary",
    ", we obtain the best mass model fits under the assumption of a burkert or nfw dark matter halo .",
    "both dark matter models can cope with the decreasing rotation curve of ngc  300 at larger radii .",
    "the burkert halo provides the best fit with fixed mass scaling factors , but both halo models produce similarly good fits with variable mass scaling factors , although the gas mass scaling factor is slightly larger and less realistic for the nfw halo .",
    "the resulting total mass of ngc  300 within @xmath13 amounts to @xmath199 . for fixed mass scaling factors",
    "almost 90  per cent of the mass is contributed by dark matter . in the case of variable mass scaling factors",
    "we obtain 68  per cent dark matter for both the burkert and nfw halo models ( but only 57  per cent for the pseudo - isothermal halo model ) .",
    "however , all these results should be approached with great caution .",
    "first of all , none of the dark matter models discussed above is physically motivated . instead , these are heuristic models based mainly on the results of numerical computer simulations .",
    "secondly , the lower @xmath192 values of the models with dark matter compared to those without dark matter may simply reflect the larger number of free fitting parameters in the former case .",
    "any increase in the number of mass components or free parameters may naturally improve the goodness of fit , no matter what dark matter model one assumes .",
    "a conspicuous feature of ngc  300 is its extended outer disc spanning more than @xmath9 ( equivalent to about @xmath10 ) across the sky .",
    "although the outer disc was partly mapped by previous observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this is the first time that its extent has been imaged out to the @xmath2 column density level with moderately high spatial resolution of approximately @xmath7 .",
    "the results of our tilted ring model suggest that there is a substantial change in position angle between the inner and outer disc , resulting in a twisted appearance of ngc  300 which is particularly obvious in the velocity field .",
    "one possible scenario for this twist is that the distortion and warping of the outer disc of ngc  300 was caused by tidal forces during a recent encounter with another galaxy .",
    "a potential candidate for a close encounter could be ngc  55 .",
    "both galaxies are separated by about @xmath200 on the sky , corresponding to a projected separation of about @xmath201 . under the assumption that both galaxies move away from each other at a relative velocity of @xmath202 ,",

    "this time scale is comparable to the @xmath204 that have passed since the previous perigalactic passage of the magellanic clouds on their orbit about the milky way and the resulting creation of the magellanic stream as predicted by numerical simulations ( @xcite ; however see @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the distortion of the disc of ngc  300 could have been caused by a recent encounter with a smaller companion galaxy .",

    "surprisingly , the luminosity of the stellar disc of ngc  300 shows a simple exponential profile over its entire radial extent ( except for the nuclear region ) without any indication of a deviation or break .",
    "this seems to contradict our observation of a strongly warped disc with a rather discontinuous transition between the inner and outer disc .",
    "if this warp were the result of tidal interaction , the stellar disc should have been affected in the same way .",
    "it is important to note that @xcite did not map the entire two - dimensional distribution of the outer disc on the sky , but observed only two fields in the south - eastern quadrant of ngc  300 .",
    "any warp in the stellar disc would therefore have to affect the stars at this particular azimuthal angle to be discernible , and further optical imaging at different azimuthal angles would be required to firmly exclude the presence of a warp in the outer stellar disc .",

    "* we constructed different mass models of ngc  300 involving a stellar disc , a gas disc , and a dark matter halo .",
    "we obtain good fits for both the burkert and nfw dark matter halo models , both of which successfully cope with the decreasing rotation velocity in the outer parts of the galaxy . fits with either newtonian dynamics or modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) and no dark matter halo at all result in much higher @xmath265 values and unrealistic mass scaling factors for the gaseous disc . *",
    "the twisted structure of the disc of ngc  300 suggests distortion by tidal interaction , but no nearby companion galaxy is currently known that could have exerted strong tidal forces on the disc . at the same time , optical studies by @xcite provide evidence against tidal interaction by demonstrating that the stellar disc of ngc  300 has a simple exponential radial profile out to the largest detected radii without any sign of distortion . *",
    "optical observations by @xcite have shown that the stellar population in the outer disc is predominantly old ( @xmath225 ) and that therefore the outer gas disc does not currently play a significant role in the star formation activity of ngc  300 .",
    "* asymmetries in the outer disc suggest that ngc  300 is affected by ram pressure interaction while moving through the intergalactic medium of the sculptor group , with its proper motion on the sky directed approximately to the south - east .",
    "estimates show that , under reasonable assumptions on the igm density and relative velocity , the outer edge of the disc of ngc  300 may be significantly distorted by ram pressure . from our analysis",
    "we conclude that the density of the igm in the sculptor group must be lower than about @xmath16 as otherwise the outer parts of the disc of ngc  300 could not have survived .",
