    "the analogy of the parametric resonance , which we derived in the two - generation framework  @xcite , is demonstrated to remain valid in realistic three - generation neutrino oscillations .",
    "our study elucidates the correspondence between the length scale of matter density variation and the energy of neutrinos . the high fourier mode , which represents the small - scale variation of the matter density , is shown to have significance for the oscillation of the low - energy neutrinos .",
