    "rhythmic motor behaviors , such as heartbeat , respiration , chewing , and locomotion are often independently produced by small networks of neurons called central pattern generators ( cpgs ) .",
    "it is not clear either what mechanisms a single motor system can use to generate multiple rhythms , for instance : whether cpgs use dedicated circuitry for each function or whether the same circuitry is can govern several behaviors . a systematic way to explore",
    "this is to create mathematical models that use biologically plausible components and classify the possible varieties of rhythmic outcomes .",
    "we performed such a study of cpg networks based on three inter - connected neurons .",
    "we systematically varied the connection types and strengths between the neurons to discover how these affect the behavioral repertoire of the cpg . to do this",
    ", we created a geometric representation of the simulated cpg behavior of each possible configuration of the network , which greatly simplifies the study of the 9-dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "we discovered several configurations that support multiple rhythms and characterized their robustness . by varying physiologically reasonable parameters in the model",
    ", we also describe some mechanisms by which a biological system could be switched between its multiple stable rhythmic states .",
    "a central pattern generator ( cpg ) is a neural circuit of cells whose synergetic interactions can autonomously produce rhythmic patterns of activity that determine vital motor behaviors in animals @xcite .",
    "cpgs have been identified and studied in many animals , where they have been implicated in the control of diverse behaviors such as heartbeat , sleep , respiration , chewing , and locomotion on land and in water @xcite .",
    "mathematical modeling studies , at both abstract and realistic levels of description , have provided useful insights into the operational principles of cpgs@xcite .",
    "although many dynamic models of specific cpgs have been developed , it remains unclear how cpgs achieve the level of robustness and stability observed in nature @xcite .",
    "a common component of many identified cpgs is a half - center oscillator ( hco ) , which is composed of two bilaterally symmetric cells reciprocally inhibiting each other to produce an alternating anti - phase bursting pattern @xcite .",
    "there has been much work on the mechanisms giving rise to anti - phase bursting in relaxation hco networks , including synaptic release , escape and post - inhibitory rebound @xcite .",
    "studies of hcos composed of hodgkin - huxley type model cells have also demonstrated the possibility of bistability and the coexistence of several in - phase and anti - phase bursting patterns based on synaptic time scales or delays @xcite .",
    "we are interested in exploring the constituent building blocks  or `` motifs ''  that make up more complex cpg circuits , and the dynamic principles behind the support of more general multi - stable rhythmic patterns @xcite",
    ". we will refer to multi - stable rhythmic patterns as `` polyrhythms . ''",
    "we consider the range of basic motifs comprising of three biophysical neurons and their chemical synapses , and how those relate to , and can be understood from the known principles of two - cell hcos .",
    "we will study the roles of asymmetric and unique connections , and the intrinsic properties of their associated neurons , in generating a set of coexisting synchronous patterns of bursting waveforms .",
    "the particular kinds of network structure that we study here reflect the known physiology of various cpg networks in real animals .",
    "many anatomically and physiologically diverse cpg circuits involve a three - cell motif @xcite , including the spiny lobster pyloric network @xcite , the _ tritonia _ swim circuit , and the _ lymnaea _ respiratory cpgs @xcite .",
    "an important open question in the experimental study of real cpgs is whether they use dedicated circuitry for each output pattern , or whether the same circuitry is multi - functional @xcite , i.e. can govern several behaviors .",
    "switching between multi - stable rhythms can be attributed to input - dependent switching between attractors of the cpg , where each attractor is associated with a specific rhythm .",
    "our goal is to characterize how observed multi - stable states arise from the coupling , and also to suggest how real circuits may take advantage of the multi - stable states to dynamically switch between rhythmic outputs .",
    "for example , we will show how motif rhythms are selected by changing the relative timing of bursts by physiologically plausible perturbations .",
    "we will also demonstrate how the set of possible rhythmic outcomes can be controlled by varying the duty cycle of bursts , and by varying the network coupling both symmetrically and asymmetrically @xcite .",
    "we also consider the role of a small number of excitatory or electrical connections in an otherwise inhibitory network .",
    "our greater goal is to gain insight into the rules governing pattern formation in complex networks of neurons , for which we believe one should first investigate the rules underlying the emergence of cooperative rhythms in smaller network motifs .    in this work , we apply a novel computational tool that reduces the problem of stability and existence of bursting rhythms in large networks to the bifurcation analysis of fixed points ( abbreviated fps ) and invariant circles of poincar return maps measuring the phase lags between the burst initiations in the cells .",
    "the structure of the phase space of the map reflects the characteristics the state space of the corresponding cpg motif .",
    "equipped with the maps , we are able to predict and identify the set of robust bursting outcomes of the cpg . these states are either phase - locked or periodically varying lags corresponding to fp or invariant circle attractors ( respectively ) of the map .",
    "comprehensive simulations of the transient phasic relationships in the network are based on the delayed release of cells from a suppressed , hyperpolarized state .",
    "this complements the phase resetting technique allowing for thorough exploration of network dynamics with spiking cells @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that more general synaptically - coupled networks possess stable bursting patterns that do not occur in similar three - oscillator motifs with gap junction coupling , which is bidirectionally symmetric @xcite .",
    "our results are organized as follows : first , we introduce our new computational tools , which are based on 2d return maps for phase lags between oscillators .",
    "we then present maps for symmetric inhibitory motifs and examine the structure of the maps depends on the duty cycle of bursting , i.e. on how close the individual neurons are to the boundaries between activity types ( hyperpolarized quiescence and tonic spiking ) . here",
    ", we also examine bifurcations that the map undergoes as the rotational symmetry of the reciprocally 3-cell motif is broken .",
    "this is followed by a detailed analysis of bifurcations of fixed point ( fp ) and invariant circle attractors of the maps for several characteristic configurations of asymmetric motifs , including a cpg based on a model of the pyloric circuit of a crustacean .",
    "we conclude the inhibitory cases with the consideration of the fine structure of a map near a synchronous state .",
    "we then discuss the maps for 3-cell motifs with only excitatory synapses , which is followed by the examination of mixed inhibitory - excitatory motifs , and finally an inhibitory motif with an additional electrical synapse in the form of a gap junction .",
    "we introduce a new method for computationally analyzing phase - locked dynamics of our networks .",
    "this is a non - standard method that has general utility outside of our application , and we therefore present it here as a scientific result .",
    "we first introduce the types of trajectories we focus on and how we measure them .",
    "the reduced leech heart interneuron can demonstrate many regular and irregular activity types , including hyper- and de - polarized quiescence , tonic spiking and bursting oscillations .",
    "we focus on periodic bursting , and figure  [ fig1 ] shows a trajectory ( dark gray ) in the 3d phase space of the model .",
    "the helical coils of the trajectory correspond to the active tonic spiking period of bursting due to the fast sodium current .",
    "the flat section corresponds to the hyperpolarized quiescent portion of bursting due to the slow recovery of the potassium current . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , two snapshots ( at @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) depict the positions of the blue , green and red spheres representing the momentarily states of all three interneurons .",
    "the coupling between the cells is chosen weak so that network interactions should only affect the relative phases of the cells on the intact bursting trajectory , i.e. without deforming the trajectory .",
    "@xmath2 is a model parameter that measures the deviation from the half - activation voltage @xmath3 of the potassium channel , @xmath4 .",
    "we use @xmath2 as a bifurcation parameter to control the duty cycle ( dc ) of the interneurons .",
    "the duty cycle is the fraction of the burst period in which the cell is spiking , and is a property known to affect the synchronization properties of coupled bursters @xcite .",
    "the individual cell remains bursting within the interval @xmath5 $ ] . at smaller values of @xmath2",
    ", it begins oscillating tonically about the depolarized steady state , and becomes quiescent at greater values of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the closer the cell is to either boundary , the dc of bursting becomes longer or shorter respective : the dc is about @xmath6 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 dc we set @xmath11 , in the middle of the bursting interval ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "when an isolated bursting cell is set close to a transition to either tonic spiking or hyperpolarized quiescence , its network dynamics become sensitive to external perturbations from its pre - synaptic cells . for example , when the post - synaptic cell is close to the tonic - spiking boundary , excitation can cause the post - synaptic cell to burst longer or even move it ( temporarily ) over the boundary into the tonic spiking ( ts ) region .",
    "in contrast , inhibition shortens the duty cycle of the post - synaptic neuron if it does not completely suppress its activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we reduce the problem of the existence and stability of bursting rhythmic patterns to the bifurcation analysis of fps and invariant curves of poincar return maps for phase lags between the neurons . in this study",
    ", we mostly consider relatively weakly coupled motifs , but our approach has no inherent limitation to weak coupling . here , the weakly coupled case is a pilot study that lets us test our technique and also uncover all rhythms , both stable and unstable , that can possibly occur in the network .",
    "detailed scrutiny of the return maps is computationally expensive : an exploration of one parameter set can take up to three three hours on a state - of - the - art desktop workstation depending on the accuracy of the mesh of initial conditions and length of the transients computed .",
    "the phase relationships between the coupled cells are defined through specific events , @xmath12 , when their voltages cross a threshold , @xmath13 , from below .",
    "such an event indicates the initiation of the @xmath14 burst in the cells , see fig .",
    "we choose @xmath15 , above the hyperpolarized voltage and below the spike oscillations within bursts .",
    "we define a sequence of _ phase lags _ by the delays in burst initiations relative to that of the reference cell  1 , normalized over the current network period or the burst recurrent times for the reference cell , as follows : @xmath16    an ordered pair , @xmath17 , defines a forward iterate , or a phase point , of the poincar return map for the phase lags : @xmath18 a sequence , @xmath19 , yields a forward _ phase lag trajectory _ , @xmath20 , of the poincar return map on a 2d torus @xmath21 with phases defined on mod  1 ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "typically , such a trajectory is run for @xmath22 bursting cycles in our simulations .",
    "the run can be stopped when the distance between several successive iterates becomes less than some preset value , say @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is taken to mean that the trajectory has converged to a fixed point , @xmath25 , of the map .",
    "this fp corresponds to a phase locked rhythm and its coordinates correspond to specific constant phase lags between the cells . by varying the initial delays between cells  2 and 3 with respect to the reference cell  1",
    ", we can detect any and all fps of the map and identify the corresponding attractor basins and their boundaries .",
    "we say that coupling is _ weak _ between two cells of a motif when the convergence rate to any stable fp of the return map is slow .",
    "this means that the distance between any two successive iterates of a trajectory of the return map remains smaller than some bound , e.g. @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we can say that coupling is relatively strong if a remote transient reaches a fp of the map after just a few iterates . we point out that the convergence can be quick even for nominally small @xmath27 provided that an individual cell is sufficiently close to either boundary of bursting activity ( tonic spiking or quiescence ) .    we conclude this section with some technical remarks concerning computational derivations of the map , @xmath28 . _ a priori _ ,",
    "the initial period ( recurrence time ) of the motif s dynamics is unknown due to the unknown outcome of nonlinear cell interactions ; furthermore , it varies over the course of the bursting transient until it converges to a fixed value on the phase locked state .",
    "we can estimate the initial phase lag in a first order approximation , @xmath29 between the networked neurons , as the phase lags @xmath30 on the periodic synchronous solution of period @xmath31 . note that @xmath32 is shifted away from @xmath33 , i.e. is advanced or delayed .",
    "notice that , in the weakly coupled case , the recurrent times of the reference cell are close to @xmath31 , which implies @xmath34 . by setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37",
    "we can parameterize the synchronous solution by a time shift , @xmath38 or , alternatively , by phase lags @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we can determine the initial phase lags by releasing the reference cell and having the others suppressed by external inhibitory pulses for @xmath40 and @xmath41 from the same initial point , given by @xmath42 , on the synchronous bursting trajectory .",
    "in essence , this means that initial phases between the reference cell and another can be set by releasing the latter from inhibition at various delays .    to complete a single phase lag map we choose the initial phase lags to be uniformly distributed on a grid of at least @xmath43 points over the @xmath44 torus .",
    "the initial guess for the phase lag distribution is based on knowledge of a trajectory for a synchronized motif .",
    "this guess will therefore differ from the self - consistent phase lag distribution once the networked cells begin to interact , especially with coupling strength variations .",
    "similarly , the estimated network period , @xmath31 , will differ from the network s actual self - consistent period . in computations",
    ", this may result in fast jumps from the set of guessed initial phases from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "these jumps are artifacts of our setup and not relevant to our study of the attractors , and so we begin recording the phase lag trajectory settled from the second bursting cycle . due to weak coupling , transients do not evolve quickly , and we connect phase lag iterates of the map by straight lines in order to demonstrate and preserve the forward order , making them superficially resemble continuous - time vector fields in a plane .",
    "lastly , we unfold the torus onto a unit square for the sake of visibility .",
    "we first examine three homogeneous ( permutationally symmetric ) configurations of the network with nearly identical cells and connections .",
    "we demonstrate that these symmetric network motifs are multistable and hence able to produce several coexisting bursting patterns .",
    "the homogeneous case allows us to reveal the role of the duty cycle as an order parameter that determines what robust patterns are observable .",
    "we suggest a biologically plausible switching mechanism between the possible bursting patterns by application of a small hyperpolarized current that temporarily blocks a targeted cell .      we begin with a",
    "weakly coupled with @xmath47 , homogeneous motif with @xmath8 dc and @xmath9 , which is close to the transition boundary between bursting and hyperpolarized quiescence .",
    "the proximity to the boundary means that even weak inhibition is able to suppress a postsynaptic cell that is near the hyperpolarized quiescent state ( figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .    figure  [ fig5]a shows the transient behaviors of the iterates of the phase lags @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( shown in blue and gray colors ) arising from initial conditions distributed uniformly over the unit interval . the phase lags exponentially converge to phase - locked states near @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq_map ] ) , we compute the map @xmath28 that is shown in fig .",
    "the projection of the map onto the unit square is an efficient way to represent the synchronized evolution of the phase lags and facilitates easy identification of the phase - locked states .",
    "these states are identified by three coexisting stable fps or attractors of the system to which all forward iterates converge . here ,",
    "the fps are : red at @xmath52 , green at @xmath53 , and blue at @xmath54 .",
    "the attractor basins of the stable fps are shown in the corresponding colors .",
    "the attractor basins are subdivided by separatrices ( incoming and outgoing sets ) of six saddle fps ( shown by small dots ) in the map . the robustness of a rhythm to perturbations is related to the size of its attractor basin .",
    "similarly , fps that have much larger basins than others can be thought of as `` dominating '' the phase plane in terms of likelihood of becoming the active state for a random initial condition or perturbation .",
    "two triplets of saddles surround two more unstable fps located at approximately @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the immediate neighborhood of the origin has a complex structure at high magnification , but globally it acts as a repeller ( see the corresponding section on the fine structure near the origin ) .",
    "let us interpret the role of a stable fp , for example the red one , in terms of phase - locked bursting patterns .",
    "since the phases are defined modulo one , the coordinates @xmath57 , imply that the corresponding rhythm is characterized by two fixed conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the reference cell fires in - phase ( synchronized ) with cell  2 and in anti - phase ( anti - synchronized ) with cell  3 . symbolically , we will use the following notation for this rhythm : @xmath60 , in which in - phase and anti - phase bursting are represented by ( @xmath61 , or @xmath62 ) and ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) , respectively .    following this notation",
    ", the stable fp ( blue ) at @xmath65 corresponds to the robust @xmath66 pattern , while the stable ( green ) fp @xmath67 corresponds to the @xmath68 pattern .",
    "these coexisting bursting rhythms are shown in fig .",
    "the motif can be made to switch between the polyrhythms by applying external pulses of appropriate duration to the targeted cells .",
    "two fps around @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to clockwise and counter - clockwise traveling waves ( respectively ) that we denote @xmath71 and @xmath72 . here",
    ", the period of either traveling wave is broken into three episodes in which each cell is actively bursting one at a time .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the clockwise bursting , @xmath71 , the cell ordering is  1 - 2 - 3 before the pattern repeats .",
    "the co - existence of these two waves originates from the rotational symmetry of the homogeneous motif .",
    "however , both such traveling bursting waves are not robust and therefore can not be observed in the motif with a short duty cycle because the corresponding fps are repelling , so that a small perturbation will cause the phase lags of such a traveling rhythm to transition to those corresponding to one of three `` pacemaker '' states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "next , we consider the bursting motif that has a longer duty cycle of @xmath6 .",
    "this duty cycle is achieved by setting @xmath7 , which brings the cells closer to the boundary separating bursting and tonic spiking activities ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . the corresponding return map for the phase lags",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "there are two equally dominating stable fps , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , corresponding to the now highly robust counter - clockwise @xmath72 and clockwise @xmath71 traveling waves .",
    "figure  [ fig8]b illustrates the waveforms , as well as the bistability of the motif initially producing the counter - clockwise , @xmath72 , traveling wave that reverses into the clockwise one , @xmath71 , after a 10 second inhibitory pulse ended and released the blue reference cell to initiate a burst .      to complete the examination of the influence of duty cycle on the repertoire and robustness of bursting outcomes of the homogeneous motif",
    ", we now consider the case of the medium - length duty cycle , @xmath10 , at @xmath11 ( the middle interval shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "similarly to figure  [ fig5]a , figure  [ fig9]a illustrates the evolution of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( shown in blue and gray colors ) from initial conditions uniformly distributed over the unit interval .",
    "one can observe transients ultimately converging to multiple constant phase locked states .",
    "the corresponding map @xmath28 is presented in fig .  [ fig9]b .",
    "in contrast to the case of short and long bursting motifs , the map for the medium bursting motif with weak homogeneous connections reveals the coexistence of five stable fps : the red one at @xmath77 , the green one at @xmath78 , the blue one at @xmath79 , the black one at @xmath70 and the gray one at @xmath80 .",
    "these fps represent , correspondingly , five robust polyrhythms : the anti - phase @xmath60 , @xmath68 , @xmath66 bursting patterns , and two traveling waves , clockwise , @xmath71 , and counter - clockwise , @xmath72 .      in this section",
    ", we elucidate how and what intrinsic properties of the individual bursting cells affect the multistability of the 3-cell inhibitory motif .",
    "the answer involves an interplay between the competitive dynamical properties of individual neurons and the cooperative properties of the network .",
    "more specifically , it relies on how close an isolated cell is to the boundary between bursting and hyperpolarized quiescence and how sensitive the post - synaptic cell is to the ( even weakly ) inhibitory current generated by the pre - synaptic cells .",
    "we investigate these ideas by introducing asymmetries into the coupling of our homogeneous network motif .",
    "we focus on several representative cases of asymmetrically coupled motifs with one or more altered synaptic strengths , and we will elaborate on their bifurcations as we vary the asymmetry .      in this subsection , we analyze bifurcations occurring _ en route _ from the homogeneous 3-cell motif to a rotationally - symmetric one , during which _ all _ clockwise- and counter - clockwise - directed synapses are simultaneously increased and decreased , respectively . in the limiting case of a clockwise , uni - directionally coupled motif there is a single traveling wave .",
    "the question is : in what direction will the wave travel ?",
    "we use a new bifurcation parameter , @xmath81 , which controls the rotational symmetry as the deviation from the nominal coupling strengths , @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the limit @xmath85 corresponds to the unidirectional case . recall that initially , at @xmath86 , both the traveling waves @xmath71 and @xmath72 are unstable in the short bursting motif with @xmath87 dc . then , the network can only generate the @xmath66 , @xmath68 , @xmath60 pacemaker rhythms .    figure  [ fig11]a depicts @xmath28 at a critical value of @xmath88 , and reveals that the fp @xmath89 is stable .",
    "thus the counter - clockwise traveling wave , @xmath72 , is now observable in the asymmetric motif .",
    "the value @xmath88 is a bifurcation value because further increase make the three saddles and the three initially stable fps ( blue , green and red ) , merge in pairs and annihilate though three simultaneous saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "after that , the fp around @xmath90 becomes the _ global attractor _ of the network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11]c ) at @xmath91 , which produces the single counter - clockwise @xmath72 traveling wave , while the fp at @xmath74 remains unstable .",
    "next we have to characterize the missing stages for the transformation of the initially unstable fp , @xmath72 , into the stable one at @xmath91 .",
    "two additional maps , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , focus on the area near this point , and shed light onto the intermediates in the bifurcation sequence . figure  [ fig12]a depicts an enlargement of @xmath28 at @xmath92 .",
    "it shows a stable invariant curve near a heteroclinic connection involving all three saddles around the fp @xmath55 . in this figure ,",
    "the fp near the center of the plot is still unstable .",
    "this indicates that the invariant curve has emerged from the heteroclinic connection at a smaller value of the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the stable invariant curve is associated with the appearance of slow phase `` jitters '' demonstrated by the @xmath72 rhythm in voltage traces .    as @xmath81",
    "is increased further , the stable invariant curve shrinks down and collapses into the unstable fp @xmath70 making it stable through a secondary supercritical andronov - hopf ( otherwise known as a torus bifurcation ) as shown in fig .  [ fig12]b .",
    "the homogeneous 3-cell motif has six independent connections , due to permutation properties we can limit our consideration of asymmetrically coupled motifs only to a few principle cases without loss of generality .",
    "first under consideration is the motif with a single synaptic connection , @xmath93 , from cell  3 to cell  1 , being made stronger .",
    "we first consider a perturbation to the homogeneous motif comprised of long bursting cells where just a single uni - directional connection , for instance from cell 2 to 3 , is strengthened . to do this",
    ", we increase the coupling stenght @xmath93 from the the nominal value , @xmath94 , through @xmath95 , to @xmath96 .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to increasing the parameter @xmath2 only for cell  3 , thus pushing it toward the quiescence boundary and extending its interburst intervals .",
    "the corresponding maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "we observe that the initial increase of @xmath93 breaks the clockwise symmetry of the motif and makes the stable node at @xmath70 and a saddle come together .",
    "this motion further shrinks the attractor basin of the @xmath72 pattern .",
    "when @xmath93 is increased to @xmath97 , both fps have annihilated through a saddle - node bifurcation . in the aftermath",
    ", the unperturbed fp at @xmath74 remains the unique attractor of such an map . in turn",
    ", the asymmetric motif can stably produce the single bursting pattern , which is the @xmath71 traveling wave .    as our case study throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we use the non - homogeneous 3-cell motifs composed of bursting cells with @xmath10 duty cycle at @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig14 ] depicts the stages of transformation of the phase lag maps for the motif with the connection @xmath93 increasing from @xmath98 and @xmath99 through @xmath100 .",
    "inset  a of fig  [ fig14 ] shows how the variations in @xmath93 first break the clockwise rotational symmetry that underlies the existence of the corresponding traveling wave . as @xmath93",
    "is increased to @xmath98 the saddle between the fps @xmath101 and @xmath74 shifts closer to the one corresponding to the @xmath71 wave .",
    "a further increase of @xmath93 makes the saddle and the stable fp at @xmath102 annihilate through a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "this widens the attractor basin ( colored red in the figure ) of the most robust fp at @xmath103 after the clockwise traveling wave has been eliminated at @xmath104 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14]b . at this value of @xmath93",
    ", the @xmath60 rhythm dominates over the remaining bursting rhythms because the red cell  3 produces more inhibition than the other two . to justify this assertion",
    "we point out that another motif , with weakened clockwise connections ( @xmath105 ) generates the identical poincar return map to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14]a .    in the @xmath60 rhythm , cell  3 bursts in anti -",
    "phase with the synchronous cells  1 and 2 that receive evenly balanced influx of inhibition from cell 3 .",
    "this is no longer the case after the connection @xmath93 is made even stronger , so that the active cell  3 can not hold both quiescent the postsynaptic cells  1 and 2 due to uneven coupling weights @xmath106 in the motif .",
    "one can see from the corresponding map fig .",
    "[ fig14]b that the red fp at @xmath107 is approached by a saddle point from the left at @xmath104 . the map in fig .",
    "[ fig14]c reveals that increasing @xmath93 through @xmath100 causes a drastic change in the motif : the dominant red fp has vanished through a subsequent saddle - node bifurcation and so has the @xmath60 rhythm .    with a single asymmetric connection",
    ", the structure of the phase lag map remains intact .",
    "however , the figure shows that the counter - clockwise wave has become the most robust rhythm , as the corresponding fp at @xmath108 has the largest attractor basin in the initial phase distribution .      as an example , we examine bifurcation scenarios that occur as we transition to a heterogeneous motif that resembles the crustacean pyloric circuit with one inhibitory connection missing @xcite . such a network can be also treated as a sub - motif of a larger crustacean stomatogastric network @xcite .    the transformation stages are singled out in fig .",

    ", decreasing a single either clockwise or counter - clockwise directional connection removes the corresponding fp at @xmath56 or @xmath55 , respectively . in this",
    "given case , it is the stable clockwise @xmath102 fp that vanishes though a saddle - node bifurcation after @xmath109 is decreased below @xmath110 .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath111 , cell  2 can not maintain the synchrony between cells  1 and 3 in the @xmath68 rhythms , which is explained by a similar argument .",
    "this assertion is supported by the phase lag maps in fig .",

    "the principal distinction from the prior case is that one connection , @xmath93 , is made twice as strong as the others in the prior case , while here we completely remove a single connection in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "a consequence is that the basin of the stable fp at @xmath70 breaks down after it vanished through the the third saddle node bifurcation that occur with the single connection been taken out , even while the three counter - clockwise connections remain intact .",
    "its `` ghost '' remains influential , however , for some initial phase lags the motif can generate a long transient episode resembling the @xmath71 traveling wave .",

    ", we examine the motif with two uni - directional connection asymmetries , for example where @xmath117 and @xmath93 are strengthened from the nominal value to @xmath95 .",
    "the bifurcation stages of @xmath28 are depicted in fig  [ fig16 ] . during the transformations , the map loses three fps in sequence through similar saddle - node bifurcations . because increasing @xmath93 and @xmath117 breaks the clockwise symmetry , the corresponding fp at @xmath118 for the counter - clockwise wave , @xmath71 , is annihilated first at around @xmath119 after merging with a saddle . further strengthening both corrections",
    "annihilates the blue fp at @xmath120 , followed by the red fp at @xmath112 . as such ,",
    "the pacemaker @xmath66 and @xmath60 rhythms eventually are no longer available as neither cells  1 nor 3 are able to hold the post - synaptic counterparts in synchrony , and also because the periods of the unevenly driven cells become too different .",
    "the clockwise symmetry breaking does not affect counter - clockwise connections .",
    "thus , in the map for @xmath95 , two rhythmic patterns persist : the @xmath72 traveling wave with a wide attractor basin and the pacemaker @xmath68 rhythm .",
    "their associated fps are at @xmath121 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that the same sequence of bifurcations will not occur in the map and the motif if only the connection @xmath122 is weakened instead .",
    "next under consideration is a motif in which cell  1 alone produces stronger inhibitory output due to two strengthened connections , @xmath117 and @xmath123 .",
    "figure  [ fig17 ] depicts two snapshots of the phase spaces of the map after @xmath123 and then @xmath117 have been strengthened .",
    "one sees that a @xmath124 increase in inhibition in the counter - clockwise direction breaks the rotational symmetry and therefore makes the stable fp at @xmath125 ( corresponding to the @xmath72 rhythm ) disappear through a saddle - node bifurcation as it merges with a saddle . as in the previous cases , the attractor basin of the stable blue pacemaker at @xmath115 extends to absorb that of the former fp . as expected , since",
    "all counter - clockwise connections have remained equal in this case , the stable fp at @xmath126 persists , as does the @xmath71 traveling wave . the dominating rhythm , clockwise traveling wave @xmath71 , coexists with anti - phase @xmath68 , @xmath60 rhythms .",
    "next , in addition to @xmath123 , the second outgoing connection , @xmath117 , from cell  1 is strengthened thus breaking the clockwise symmetry as well . as expected , this eliminates the fp at @xmath102 and the corresponding clockwise @xmath71 traveling pattern from the motif .",
    "figure  [ fig17]b shows the map for the motif with @xmath127 . while it retains all three `` pacemaker '' fps , the one at @xmath115 corresponding to the strongly inhibiting pre - synaptic cell  1 possess the largest attractor basin .",
    "we may conclude that strengthening a single directional connection , or alternatively , a simultaneous and proportional weakening coupling strengths of the two synaptic connections of the same orientation in the motif , controls one of the three saddle points between the fp corresponding to traveling waves and the pacemaker fp corresponding to the stronger inhibiting cell .",
    "this will eventually causes the disappearance of either point as soon as the rotational symmetry is broken after the coupling strength is increased over some critical value , which varies depending on the nominal value @xmath27 and the duty cycle of the bursting cells .",
    "a 3-cell motif with the cells coupled reciprocally by inhibitory synapses can be viewed alternatively as a group of three half - center oscillators ( hco ) .",
    "each hco represents a pair of cells that typically burst in anti - phase , when isolated from other cells .",
    "when a hco is symmetrically driven , even weakly , by another bursting cell , it can produce in - phase bursting , instead of out of phase bursting @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we consider transformations of rhythmic outcomes in the motif containing a single hco with stronger reciprocally inhibitory connections , for example , @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig18]a ) .",
    "it turns out that a 25% increase in coupling is sufficient to break both rotational symmetries because it eliminates the associated fps around @xmath118 and @xmath118 through saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "since both connections are strengthened simultaneously , the attractor basins of the both dominating fps , blue near @xmath115 and green near @xmath129 , widen equally .",
    "however , increasing the connections @xmath117 and @xmath130 between cells  1 and 2 does not affect the attractor basin of the red fp at @xmath131 .",
    "in other words , the motif can still produce the co - existing @xmath60 rhythm .",
    "the following bifurcation sequence involving the dominant fp differs drastically from the saddle - node bifurcations discussed earlier .",
    "observe from the map in fig .",
    "[ fig18]a that two saddles separating two attractor basins , have moved close to the blue and green fps as the coupling between the hco cells is increased to @xmath132 .",
    "this is a direct indication that a further increase of the coupling strength between the strongly inhibitory cells  1 and 2 will cause two simultaneous saddle - node bifurcations that eliminate both stable fps .",
    "a feature of these bifurcations of the map at the critical moment is that there are two _ heteroclinic connections _ that bridge the saddle - node fps on the 2d torus . the breakdown of the heteroclinic connections with the disappearance of both fps results in the emergence of a stable invariant circle that wraps around the torus @xcite .",
    "the attractor basin of the new invariant curve is bounded away from that of the red fp at @xmath131 by the stable sets ( i.e. , incoming separatrices ) of the two remaining saddles .",
    "this motif is therefore bi - stable as the corresponding map shows two co - existing attractors .",
    "further increase in the coupling strength between the stronger inhibitory hco and cell  3 can not not qualitatively change the structure of the phase lag map , while it can have only a qualitatively effect on the size of the attractor basins of the invariant circle and the remaining fp ( red ) .",
    "so , weakening @xmath133 makes the separating saddles come closer to the red fp and hence shrink its attractor basin , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig18]b .",
    "this is not the case when either connection between cell  3 and the hco is made sufficiently asymmetric .",
    "depending on the connection s direction of asymmetry , such an imbalance causes either of the two remaining saddles to come close and annihilate with the stable red fp at @xmath134 .",
    "figure  [ fig19 ] presents the map for this motif with weakened reciprocal connections between cells  3 and 1 : @xmath135 .",
    "this motif , comprised of three hcos with strong , nominal and weak reciprocal connections , no longer produces any phase - locked bursting rhythm , including @xmath60 , as the map no longer has any stable fps .",
    "the resulting motif is monostable with a single attractor for the stable invariant curve .",
    "this curve can be characterized with a rational or irrational _ winding number_. the number is a rational if the invariant curve is made of a finite number of periodic points across the torus .",
    "the occurrence of the stable invariant curve wrapping around the torus gives rise to a _ phase slipping _ phenomenon observed in voltage traces such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig19]c .",
    "we define `` phase slipping '' as a repetitive rhythm with varying phase lags between the bursting cells of the motif .",
    "the period of the invariant circle depends on how far the map with the invariant circle is from the bifurcations of `` ghost '' fps .",
    "the `` ghosts '' make the bursting pattern with varying phase lags appear as it is composed of four sequential episodes and transitions between them .    from the top of the @xmath136-unit square",
    ", the curve begins with the @xmath68 rhythm continuously transitioning into the clockwise @xmath71 traveling wave , followed by the @xmath66 rhythm , and being followed by the counter - clockwise @xmath72 traveling wave and finally returning to the initial @xmath68 rhythm in nine bursting cycles , which is the period of the phase slipping .",
    "each episode of the phase slipping rhythm can be arbitrarily large as it is controlled by the coupling strength of the specific motif connections near the corresponding saddle - node bifurcation(s ) .",
    "observe that @xmath137 on the invariant curve , i.e. , while cell  1 and 2 are in anti - phase bursting , cell  3 modulates the rhythm by recurrently slowing down and advancing the hco to generate continuously all four episodes .",
    "one may wonder about what determines the direction of the invariant curve on the torus and hence the order of the episodes of the shown voltage waveform .",
    "observe that the phase slip occurs in the @xmath76 direction and that the invariant curve , unlike a fp , has no fixed period for the whole network . indeed , the recurrent times of this network change periodically , approximately every eight episodes .",
    "the eight episodes constituting the bursting pattern are determined by a rational ratio of the longer hco period ( due to stronger reciprocal inhibition that extends the hco interburst intervals ) to the shorter period of pre - synaptic cell  3 ( due to a weaker incoming inhibition ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig19]c ) .",
    "let us discuss another motif configuration , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig18]b , that produces maps with stable invariant curves that wrap around the torus .",
    "these are qualitatively identical to the maps for the motif containing the strong hco formed by cells 1 and 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig23]a ) . in this configuration",
    ", cell  3 receives weaker inhibition from pre - synaptic cells 1 and 2 according to @xmath138 .",
    "the de - stabilizing factor 0.6 turns out to be small enough to make sure that neither cell  1 nor  2 can be a pacemaker as the corresponding stable fps have disappeared because the period of cell  3 has become shorter than the periods of cells 1 and 2 . as the result , the map demonstrates the same stable invariant curve that `` flows '' downwards with decreasing @xmath76 phase lags .",
    "the direction of the stable invariant circle flowing across the 2d torus can be reversed by making cell  3 receive stronger inhibition instead of weaker inhibition relative to the other cells .",
    "an example is depicted in the phase lag map of fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] , where @xmath139 .",
    "we now elucidate the issues involved in designing inhibitory motifs with predetermined bursting outcomes and how to control them .",
    "let us revisit the motif with a single hco in fig .",
    "[ fig17]a .",
    "the map is depicted near the bifurcations that eliminate both blue and green fps simultaneously as the coupling strength between cells  1 and 2 is increased .",
    "the corresponding saddle - node bifurcations are each of co - dimension one , i.e. can be unfolded by a single parameter .",
    "this means that increasing either coupling parameter , @xmath117 or @xmath130 , makes the respective fp at @xmath140 ( green ) or @xmath115 ( blue ) disappear or re - emerge .",
    "this suggests alternative ways of perturbing the motif to get the desired outcome .",
    "for instance , in the motif with the hco given by @xmath141 , cell  2 can be made the strongest on the motif by increasing the outgoing inhibitory drive : @xmath142 .",
    "the green fp at @xmath129 in the corresponding map in fig .",
    "[ fig21]a has a largest attraction basin that guarantees the dominance of the @xmath68-rhythm over the network . the map in fig .",
    "[ fig21]b has the basin of the blue fp at @xmath120 largest , after strengthening the coupling from cell  1 to 3 in the motif with two robust bursting outcomes : the @xmath66-rhythm dominating over the @xmath60-rhythm corresponding to the red fp at @xmath143 with a smaller basin formed by initial phases .",
    "the above configurations of the inhibitory motif are bistable with two coexisting fps : dominant blue ( or green ) with a large attractor basin and red with a smaller basin corresponding to the less robust @xmath60 rhythm . to construct the monostable motif with the single rhythm , for example @xmath66 , cell  1",
    "must be coupled _ reciprocally _ stronger with cell  3 than cell 2 .",
    "such a motif has two hcos that both contain cell  1 due to the strengthened pairs of synaptic connections : @xmath144 and @xmath145 . the corresponding map for the phase lags is shown in fig .  [ fig22 ] .",
    "the resulting map demonstrates that both the red and green fps have been annihilated , as well as the corresponding bursting rhythms .",
    "note that the map still has two saddle fps in addition to the only attractor at @xmath146 .",
    "it is a feature of a map on a 2d torus that the number of fps must be even , in general , for them to emerge and vanish through saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "therefore , the map must possess another hyperbolic fp .",
    "this point resides near the origin where all three cells burst synchronously , which we consider next .",
    "a common misconception concerning modeling studies of coupled cells is that fast , non - delayed inhibitory synapses always foster anti - phase dynamics over unstable in - phase bursting . while being true in general for simple relaxation oscillators , interactions of bursting cells can be incomparably more complex even in small networks including hcos with fast inhibitory coupling @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that overlapped bursters can reciprocally synchronize each other in multiple , less robust , phase - locked states due to spike interactions .",
    "furthermore , the number of such synchronous steady states is correlated with the number of spikes within the overlapped bursts .    to explore the dual role of inhibition ,",
    "we now explore nearly synchronous bursting in all three cells of the homogeneous , medium dc motif .",
    "because synchronous steady states are due to spike interactions , we restrict the consideration to a relatively small positive vicinity of the synchronous state , @xmath147 , in @xmath28 . a magnified portion of the map is shown in fig .  [ fig23 ] , where green , red and black dots denote the locations of the stable , repelling and saddle ( threshold ) phase locked states ( respectively ) for the nearly synchronized bursting outcomes .",
    "the map reveals that several overlapping burst patterns can occur where either cell spikes slightly in advance or delayed compared to the reference cell .",
    "unstable fps surround the outer part of this small region of the map make the origin repelling in the map on the global scale .      in this section",

    "@xmath152 guarantees that the voltages of all the cells remain below the reversal potential , _ on average _ , over the bursting period . in the excitatory motif , whenever the advanced cell initiatives a new bursting cycle , the synaptic current raises the voltages of post - synaptic cells , thus making it follow the pre - synaptic one , at the hyperpolarized knee - point on the quiescent manifold ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the phase lag map for the original inhibitory motif with three stable fps ( shown in blue , red and green ) at @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and two unstable fps ( dark dots ) at @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the attractor basins of three stable fps are separated by the separatrices of six saddle fps ( smaller dots ) .",
    "a small area around the origin is globally repelling .",
    "this motif can stably produce three coexisting patterns in which either cell bursts in anti - phase with the two remaining in - phase .    it is often presumed in neuroscience that excitation acts symmetrically opposite to inhibition in most cases , i.e. wherever inhibition tends to break synchrony , excitation fosters it .",
    "figure  [ fig24 ] supports this assertion for this particular kind of network and coupling .",
    "it depicts the map corresponding to the homogeneous 3-cell motif with reciprocally excitatory connections for same short , 25% dc .",
    "compared to the map for the inhibitory motif , the map for the homogeneously excitatory motif is the inverse : @xmath158 ; here the inverse is the forward map in discrete backward time . as such ,",
    "the fps at @xmath159 and @xmath55 , which used to be repelling in the inhibitory case , become attracting but with smaller basins .",
    "this means that the motif can generate traveling waves , albeit with low probability .",
    "meanwhile , the fps colored blue , green and red , are now repellers , and hence none of the pacemaker rhythms can occur . reversing the stability does not change the topological type of the six saddles , but their stable and unstable separatrices are reversed .",
    "the dominant attractor of the map is now located at the origin , to which nearly all transient trajectories converge .",
    "this implies that the reciprocally excitatory motif , whether homogeneous or heterogeneous , will exhibit stable synchronous bursting with all three cells oscillating in - phase .",
    "here we discuss two intermediate configurations of mixed motifs having both inhibitory and excitatory connections .",
    "first , we consider the motif with a single excitatory connection from cell  3 to  1 .",
    "its coupling strength is regulated by the level of the synaptic reversal potential , @xmath160 .",
    "figure  [ fig25 ] depicts three phase lag maps for the motif with @xmath149 being increased from @xmath161 , @xmath162 through @xmath151 .",
    "initially , an increase in @xmath160 gives rise to two saddle - node bifurcations in the motif ( fig .",
    "[ fig25]a ) : the first one breaks the clockwise rotational symmetry and hence annihilates the stable fp at @xmath163 .",
    "the second bifurcation annihilates the stable red point at @xmath164 , because cell  3 , inhibiting  2 and exciting  1 , can not hold both of them at the hyperpolarized quiescent state to generate the @xmath60-rhythm as it promotes burst initiation in cell 1 following those in cell 3 . on the contrary ,",
    "excitation applied to cell  1 forces it to follow cell  3 after a short delay in the burst initiation .",
    "as the result , the disappearance of the @xmath60-rhythm promotes the @xmath68-rhythm and an increase of the attractor basin of the green fp .",
    "initial elevations of the level of @xmath160 keep the other three fps intact , while widening the basins of the blue and green stable fps at @xmath165 and @xmath140 . further increasing @xmath160 increases the duty cycle of the blue cell by extending its active bursting phase .",
    "consequently , the counter - clockwise ring no longer contains identical cells that could orchestrate the @xmath72 pattern .",
    "this patten is eliminated with the disappearance of the corresponding fp at @xmath166 through a merger with a saddle .",
    "the map now has two persistent attractors , blue and green , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig25]b . with @xmath160",
    "increased still further , the blue cell  1 receives strongly unbalanced input : larger excitation influx from the postsynaptic cell  3 and an inhibitory drive from cell  2 , acting oppositely .",
    "this unbalanced input increases the active phase of bursting of cell 1 and hence its duty cycle and period , and hence breaks cell  1 s ability to robustly maintain the @xmath66-rhythm by evenly inhibiting the pots - synaptic cells 1 and 2 of the same period . in @xmath28 ,",
    "this results in the shrinking of the attractor basin of the blue fp , whereas the basin of the dominating green fp widens . by setting @xmath167 ,",
    "the resulting strong imbalance between excitation and inhibition onto cell  1 makes the @xmath66-rhythm impossible to occur in the network and the corresponding fp at @xmath168 disappears in the map . after this last saddle - node bifurcation",
    ", the map has a unique attractor in the green fp .",
    "eventually , regardless of initial phases , the synergetic interaction of inhibitory and excitatory cells in this mixed motif will give rise to the @xmath68-rhythm led by cell  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig26 ] ) .",
    "finally , we consider the mixed motif with two excitatory connections originating from cell  3 .",
    "figure  [ fig27 ] depicts the transformations of the @xmath28 as the reversal potentials , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , are increased simultaneously from @xmath161 , @xmath162 through to @xmath171 .",
    "the increase makes postsynaptic cells  1 and 2 more excited compared to cell  3 , which consequently receives a longer duration of inhibition .    as in the previous case , increasing @xmath172 breaks both rotational symmetries , which is accompanied by the disappearance of the corresponding , counter - clockwise and clockwise , fps .",
    "the increased excitability of cells  1 and 2 initiates the active bursting states of those cells soon after that of cell  3 in each cycle .",
    "thus , the @xmath60-rhythm led by cell  3 is less likely to occur compared to the @xmath66 and @xmath68- rhythms .",
    "the corresponding ( red ) fp at @xmath103 loses the attractor basin in the map and then disappears , following the fps for the traveling waves , at @xmath173 , see fig .",
    "[ fig27]b .",
    "after that , the blue and green stable points have equal attractor basins corresponding to equal chances of the emergence of the phase - locked rhythms @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "examination of the map suggests that besides these phase - locked rhythms , the motif can generate long transients with episodes that resemble those of the @xmath60-rhythm transitioning back and forth with in - phase bursting .",
    "such transients are due to regions of the map that are constrained by the incoming separatrices of the remaining saddles , which are forced to curve in complex ways to embed onto the torus with two attractors and an unstable origin .",
    "note that the origin may not longer be a repeller as a whole but has a saddle structure , because it is no longer associated with synchronous bursting .    setting the excitatory reversal potential to zero annihilates the two remaining phase - locked states ( blue and green fps ) in two simultaneous bifurcations . as with the case of the inhibitory motif with the hco ( compare with fig .  [ fig18 ] ) , these global bifurcations underlie the formation of a closed heteroclinic connection between the saddle - node points at the critical moment .",
    "these connections transform into an invariant circle that wraps around the torus .",
    "having settled onto the invariant curve that zigzags over the torus , the network will generate long recurrent patterns consisting of three transient episodes : namely , in - phase bursting that transitions to the @xmath66-rhythm , which transitions back to in - phase bursting , then transitioning to the @xmath68-rhythm , which then returns to the in - phase bursting , and so forth .    at higher values of reversal potentials ,",
    "excitation overpowers inhibition and this mixed motif fully becomes the excitatory motif with the single , all - synchronous , bursting rhythm forced by the driving cell  3 . in the corresponding return map ,",
    "this rhythm occurs after the invariant curve terminates at a homoclinic connection to a saddle - node near the origin so that the origin becomes a global attractor again .",
    "finally , let us consider the role of a single electrical synapse though a gap junction between cells 1 and 2 in the inhibitory motif ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the difference in the membrane potentials gives rise to a directional ohmic current described by @xmath174 in the model  ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig28 ] depicts the stages of transformation of the corresponding maps as @xmath175 is increased from @xmath176 through @xmath177 .",
    "the electrical coupling breaks down the rotational symmetry that causes the disappearance of the corresponding fps at @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the disappearance of both fps widens the attraction basin of the red fp at @xmath103 compared to the individual basins of the blue and green fps .",
    "the bidirectional electrical coupling tends to equilibriate the membrane potentials of the connected cells , so that cell 1 and 2 are brought closer together to burst in synchrony , rather than in alternation . at intermediate values of @xmath175 , inhibitory coupling",
    "can still withstand the tendency to synchronize cells 1 and 2 , while the red basin widens further due to shrinking basins of the blue and green fp . at larger values of @xmath175 , synchrony of bursting cells 1 and 2",
    "overpowers their reciprocal inhibition , and the motif generates only the @xmath60-rhythm regardless of the choice of initial phases .",
    "thus , we find that motifs with strong electrical synapses describe a dedicated rather than a multifunctional cpg .",
    "our new computational technique reduces the dynamics of a 9-dimensional network motif of three cells to the analysis of the equationless 2d maps for the phase lags between the bursting cells . with this technique",
    ", we demonstrated that a reciprocally inhibitory network can be multistable , i.e. can generate several distinct polyrhythmic bursting patterns .",
    "we studied both homogeneous and non - homogeneous coupling scenarios as well as mixtures of inhibition , excitation and electrical coupling .",
    "we showed that the observable rhythms of the 3-cell motif are determined not only by symmetry considerations but also by the duty cycle , which serves as an order parameter for bursting networks .",
    "the knowledge of the existence , stability and possible bifurcations of polyrhythms in this 9d motif composed of the interneuron models is vital for derivations of reduced , phenomenologically accurate phase models for non - homogeneous biological cpgs with inhibitory synapses .",
    "the idea underlying our computational tool is inspired by features of a `` wet lab '' experimental setup .",
    "as such , it requires only the voltage recording from the model cells and does not explicitly rely on the gating variables .",
    "we intentionally choose the phases based on voltage as often this the only experimentally measurable variable .",
    "moreover , as with real experiments , we can control the initial phase distribution by releasing the interneurons from inhibition at specific times relative to the reference neuron .      in the homogeneous inhibitory motifs section",
    ", we showed that a weakly coupled , homogeneous motif comprised of three bursting interneurons with fast reciprocally inhibitory synapses can produce a variable number of polyrhythms , depending on the duty cycle of the individual components .",
    "the phase lag maps are _ de facto _ proof of the robust occurrence of the corresponding rhythmic outcomes generated by such a motif .",
    "while the occurrence of some rhythms , such as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in a 3-cell motif can hypothetically be deduced using symmetry arguments ; the existence and robustness of the rhythms can be only verified by accurate computations of the corresponding return maps . moreover ,",
    "the observability of these rhythms in even the homogeneous motifs , and the stability of the fps , are both closely linked to the temporal properties of the bursts .",
    "recall that the inhibitory current shifts the post - synaptic cell closer to the boundary or can even move it over the boundary into silence while the pre - synaptic cell remains actively spiking ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . in terms of dynamical systems",
    "theory , this means that the perturbed driven system closes the gap between the hyperpolarized fold and the slow nullcline @xmath180 , eventually causing the emergence of a stable equilibrium state on the quiescent branch . as such",
    ", the homogeneous network produces three pacemaker rhythms , @xmath60 , @xmath68 , and @xmath66  the only rhythms available in the short motif .",
    "these strongly synchronized activities imply fast convergence to the phase locked states because of the emergent equilibrium state near the closed gap : compare the time spans in figs .",
    "[ fig6]a and [ fig9]a .",
    "the gap never gets closed by weak inhibition in the long bursting motif as the individual cells have initially remained far enough from the boundary separating the bursting and hyperpolarized quiescence . as the result ,",
    "this motif can only effectively produce two possible bursting outcomes : the clockwise @xmath71 and counter - clockwise @xmath72 traveling waves .",
    "this bistability results from a weaker form of synchronization , which is confirmed by the rate of convergence to the fps",
    ". this will not be the case when the inhibition becomes stronger due to increasing the nominal coupling strength , @xmath181 .",
    "the intermediate case of the medium motif is far from the above extremes and benefits from a natural optimization between the coupling strength , initial phase distributions , and the spatio - temporal characteristics of unperturbed and perturbed bursting .",
    "one such characteristic is the slow passage through the ghost of the stable equilibrium state that guarantees the robust synchrony in the short bursting motif . as the result",
    ", the motif can produce five stable bursting rhythms : the anti - phase @xmath60 , @xmath68 , and @xmath66 ; and the clockwise @xmath71 and counter - clockwise @xmath72 traveling waves .    in the asymmetric inhibitory motifs section",
    ", we described a number of generic bifurcations of the five original five polyrhythms that can occur in the homogeneous , reciprocally inhibitory motif with the medium duty cycle .",
    "we revealed the basic principles of transformations of such a multi - functional network into ones with fewer rhythms or even with a single pattern bursting pattern .",
    "the rhythmic outcomes of the cpg do not always have to involve phase locking , as there can be a stable pattern of _ phase slipping _ bursts that have time varying phase lags .",
    "while each rhythm remains robust with respect to variations of the coupling connections , one can still make the network switch between them by applying an external pulse to the targeted cell that , upon release , appropriately changes the relative phases of the cells , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] for the medium bursting motif . in terms of the poincar return maps for the phase lag , switching between rhythms",
    "is interpreted as switching between the corresponding attractor basins of fps or invariant circles .",
    "this causes the state of the network to `` jump '' over the separating threshold defined by a saddle ( more precisely , over the incoming separatrices of the saddle ) .",
    "we stress , however , that the choice of timing in the suppression of a targeted cell to effectively switch between these polyrhythms is not intuitive and requires a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamics .",
    "note that , although there are alternative ways of creating the 3-cell reciprocally inhibitory motif with predetermined outcomes , the fundamental principles are universal : the pre - synaptic cell that produces stronger inhibition gains the larger attractor basin and therefore the corresponding rhythm led by this cell becomes predominant . in particular ,",
    "a sufficient increase ( or decrease ) of the coupling strength of a single connection can break the intrinsic rotational symmetry of the motif to remove the possibility of observing traveling wave patterns .    of special interest",
    "are the motifs with phase - slipping patterns that have no dominating phase - locked states .",
    "such a pattern results from the synergetic interactions between all contributing cells , and is comprised of four transient episodes , but primarily marked by a continuous transition between two primary sub - rhythms : @xmath68 and @xmath66 .",
    "both competing sub - rhythms are equally possible , and none can prevail over the other without the weaker inhibiting cell  3 whose reciprocal connections change the existing balance by shifting the phase lags during all four episodes .    in all cases",
    "we have considered , inhibition was chosen weak enough to guarantee that the post - synaptic cell remains in a bursting state even when its duty cycle decreases to @xmath87 near the boundary between bursting and silence .",
    "this ensures that the phases of the cells , as well as the phase lags , are well defined for the return maps .",
    "however , this assumption may fail , for example when phase of a post - synaptic cell is not defined because the incoming synaptic inhibition makes it quiescent ( fig .",
    "[ fig29 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this leads to a phenomenon called _ sudden death _ of bursting that occurs when a rhythmic leader cell ( red cell  3 in this figure ) becomes suppressed by the other two cells that form an anti - phase hco , which alternately inhibit the post - synaptic cell .",
    "in our example , the outgoing inhibition from cell  3 is several times weaker than the inhibition that it receives from the hco formed by cells  1 and 2 : @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( this ratio does not always have to be as large when @xmath27 is increased ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the sudden death of bursting co - exists with other bursting patterns in the motif at the same coupling parameters .",
    "as such , this example bears a close qualitative resemblance to the experimental recordings from identified interneurons comprising the leech heart cpg in which the so - called switch interneuron alternately leads synchronous patterns and then becomes inactive during peristaltic patterns @xcite .",
    "analogous reversions of direction in the blood circulation , peristaltic and synchronous , are observed in the leech heartbeat cpg and its models @xcite .",
    "the contrast between the patterns is that switching appears to be autonomously periodic , i.e. without external stimuli , in a way similar to the phase - slipping pattern presented in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] .",
    "examination of the complex fine structure of the map near the origin reconfirms that fast , non - delayed inhibition can have stabilizing effects leading to the onset of several nearly synchronous bursting patterns with several overlapping spikes @xcite .",
    "such bursting patterns are less robust compared to those corresponding to fps with large attractor basins in the phase lag maps .",
    "we showed in the excitatory motifs section that raising the synaptic reversal potential is equivalent to reversing the time in the inhibitory motif model . in the maps ,",
    "this action makes attractors into repellers , while saddles remain saddles but have their incoming and outgoing directions reversed .",
    "to fully illustrate this phenomenon , we used the symmetric motif with the short duty cycle , in which the fps for clock and counter - clockwise traveling waves are unstable . in the symmetric counterpart with excitatory synapses ,",
    "these fps become the attractors along with the dominant fixed point at the origin corresponding to synchronous bursting .    in the mixed motifs section we analyzed the transformation of the maps corresponding to the motifs with mixed , inhibitory and excitatory synapses .",
    "we showed step - by - step how the the multi - functional motif becomes a dedicated motif .",
    "the final example was the mixed motif with two excitatory connections .",
    "unlike the former case , such a monostable motif possesses a bursting rhythm with time varying phase lags , which corresponds to a stable invariant curve wrapping around the 2d torus .",
    "we emphasize that a highly detailed examination of the occurrence and robustness of bursting patterns in the 3-cell motifs would be impossible without the reduction of the complex 9d network model with six algebraic equations for chemical synapses to the 2d maps and the numerical bifurcation analysis of fps , invariant circles , homoclinic structures in it .",
    "recall that the dimension of the map is determined by the number of the nodes in the network , not the number of differential equations per a synapse and per a neuron , which can be much greater . with the aid of our computational tools we were able to identify even some exotic bifurcations from the dynamical system theory like the cherry flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig27]d ) on the torus @xcite occurring in this neural network .",
    "high accuracy of numerical simulations is required in our analysis .",
    "this involves at least a @xmath184 mesh of initial conditions run for 100 bursting cycles to generate a single map and identify its structure .",
    "this takes at least two hours on a multi - core cpu workstation , but future work will take advantage of parallel computing architectures .    a stable fp of the map corresponding to a robust bursting pattern with specific phase lags is also structurally stable , i.e. persists under particular variations of coupling parameters .",
    "so by varying the given parameter(s ) we can evaluate the boundaries and region of its existence and .",
    "a boundary of the region corresponds to a bifurcation , which cab be either a saddle - node , through which the fp her vanishes , or only looses the stability as in the andronov - hopf case . in terms of the classical synchronization theory @xcite ,",
    "the fp is mathematical representation of a phase - locked state , in the given context , it is a bursting pattern with some constant phase lags between the cells of the network .",
    "its existence / stability region is called a synchronization zone , as the bursting cells become synchronized in a certain order  pattern . using the qualitative tools of the bifurcation theory",
    ", one can quantitatively estimate the size of synchronization zones and determine their boundaries in the parameter space of the dynamical system representing the 3-cell cpg network under consideration .",
    "figure  [ fig30 ] sketches how such zones can be embedded in such a parameter space .",
    "some zones are nested within each other as changing of a single parameter of the network can consequently cause a cascade of saddle - node bifurcations in the map , for instance , such as ones shown in figs .",
    "[ fig18 ] and [ fig19 ] .",
    "given the number of the reciprocal synapses in the motif , the parameter space is at least six - dimensional , which presents quite a challenge for detailed bifurcation examinations .",
    "we have demonstrated though that several inhibitory configurations of the 3-cell motif generate phase lag map of the _ qualitatively _ same structure , see exemplary fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] .",
    "this observation provides underlying foundations for highly effective reduction tools for studies of multi - component neural networks .",
    "it implies that variations of different coupling parameters make the network undergo same bifurcations while crossing transversally the corresponding bifurcation boundaries in the parameter space .",
    "this _ de - facto _ proves again that without the phase lag maps , it would be impossible to claim and understand why two distinct network configurations produce same rhythmic outcomes .",
    "in general , our insights allow us to predict both quantitative and qualitative transformations of the observed patterns as the network configurations are altered or the network states are perturbed dynamically @xcite .",
    "the nature of these transformations provides a set of novel hypotheses for biophysical mechanisms about the control and modulation of rhythmic activity .",
    "a powerful aspect to our analytical technique is that it does not require knowledge of the equations that model the system ( even though we happened to have them here ) .",
    "the computational tools help us explain the fundamental dynamical mechanisms underlying the rhythmogenesis in plausible models of cpg networks derived from neurophysiological experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that have developed a universal approach to studying both detailed and phenomenological models that is also applicable to a variety of rhythmic biological phenomena beyond motor control .",
    "we study cpg network motifs comprised of three cells coupled reciprocally by non - delayed , fast chemical synapses and with weak coupling strengths .",
    "the time evolution of the membrane potential , @xmath185 , of each neuron is modeled using the framework of the hodgkin - huxley formalism , based on a reduction of a leech heart interneuron model , see @xcite and the references therein : @xmath186 the dynamics of the above model involve a fast sodium current , @xmath187 with the activation described by the voltage dependent gating variables , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , a slow potassium current @xmath190 with the inactivation from @xmath191 , and an ohmic leak current , @xmath192 : @xmath193 @xmath194 is the membrane capacitance and @xmath195 is an applied current .",

    "this implies that the synaptic current , @xmath213 , is initiated as soon as @xmath210 exceeds the synaptic threshold .",
    "the type , inhibitory or excitatory , of the ftm synapse is determined by the level of the reversal potential , @xmath149 , in the post - synaptic cell . in the inhibitory case",
