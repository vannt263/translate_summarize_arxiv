    "over twenty years ago montroll and shlesinger wrote that _ in the world of investigation of complex phenomena that requires statistical modeling and interpretation , several competing styles have been emerging _ , each with its own champions @xcite . lately a large amount of efforts  with a flood of papers related to one particular case  has been given to the topic .",
    "what is at play consists in that in the study of certain physicochemical systems we may face difficulties when handling situations involving fractal - like structures , correlations ( spatial and temporal ) with some type of scaling , turbulent and chaotic motion , small size ( nanometer scale ) system with eventually a low number of degrees of freedom and complicate boundary conditions , generalized hydrodynamics , and so on .",
    "the interest on them has been recently enhanced as a consequence that such situations are present in electronic and opto - electronic devices of the nowadays point - first technologies and also in technological areas involving the use of disordered systems , polymeric solutions , conducting glasses , the case of microbatteries , and others .",
    "the question is that these difficulties consist , as a rule , in that the theoretician can not properly satisfy _ fisher s criteria of efficiency and sufficiency _ @xcite in the conventional , well established , physically and logically sound boltzmann - gibbs statistics , meaning an impairment to correctly include the presence of large fluctuations ( and eventually higher - order variances ) and to account for the relevant and proper characteristics of the system , respectively .",
    "then , just out of necessity and convenience and to be able to make predictions  and in the way providing an understanding , even partial , of the physics of the system of interest , for example in analyzing technological characteristic of physico - chemical systems as illustrated in sect .",
    "one may resort to the use of statistics other than the usual form of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) one , which are not at all extensions of the latter but , as said , introduce an auxiliary detour for analyzing the problem in hands .    among existing approaches we can mention what can be called _",
    "generalized statistical mechanics _ as used by p. t. landsberg showing that functional properties of the ( informational ) entropies ( see next section ) give origin to different types of thermostatistics , and rise the question of how to select a `` proper '' one , that is , are some better than others ?",
    "@xcite ; for decades has been in use _ levy statistics _ , introducing a modified non - gaussian distribution which has been applied to a variety of problems ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; the approach of w. ebeling who has addressed the question of the treatment of a class of systems , in nature and society , which are determined by their total history ; it can be referred - to as _ ebeling statistics _ @xcite ; _ superstatistics _ developed by c. beck and e. g. d. cohen for nonequilibrium systems with complex dynamics in stationary states with large fluctuations on long - time scales @xcite ; _ non - extensive statistics _ based on havrda - charvat statistics",
    "@xcite applied to a number of cases are described in the conference proceedings of ref .",
    "@xcite : it consists in the so - called tsallis statistics @xcite ; _ renyi statistics _",
    " devised by the renowned theoretical statistitian a. renyi @xcite  has been introduced in the scientific literature , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with , for example , p. grassberger and i. procaccia @xcite using it as a valuable method for characterizing experimental chaotic signals , and recently p. jizba and t. arimitzu @xcite have presented an extensive analysis of it in a paper called `` the world according to renyi '' ; _ sharma - mittal statistics _ @xcite or better to say a variation of it ( called _ kappa or deformational statistics _ ) was used by v. m. vasyliunas in problems of astrophysical plasma @xcite and by g. kaniadakis in the case of relativistic systems @xcite ; and so on .",
    "it has been stated that some of these statistics are _ nonextensive _ as compared with bg statistics ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) but this is not quite correct once in the strict equilibrium of adiabatically closed systems , described by the microcanonical ensemble , the bg entropy is nonextensive only becoming practically extensive in the _ thermodynamic limit _",
    "( e.g. ref .",
    "the latter is one case of idealization in science @xcite , useful for particular situations however not applicable in general : notice for example the case of small systems @xcite present , e.g. , in nano - science and technology which are of a quite large interest and in ample development nowadays .",
    "we recall that in statistical mechanics the probability distribution ( statistical operator ) , usually derived from heuristic arguments , can also be derived from a variational method , once is made connection with information theory @xcite .",
    "it consists into making extremal  a maximum  , subject to certain constraints , a functional ( superoperator ) of the probability distribution ( statistical operator ) . such quantity , first introduced in shannon s theory of communication @xcite ,",
    "can be referred to as _ measure of uncertainty of information_. it has also been called statistical measure and entropy , with the understanding that it is _ informational entropy_.",
    "it is worth to emphasize  in view of some confusion that has recently pervaded the scientific literature  that the different possible informational entropies are not to be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy of the physical system .",
    "r. t. cox has noticed that the meaning of such entropies is not the same in all respects as that of anything which has a familiar name in common use , and it is therefore impossible to give a simple verbal description of it , which is , at the same time , an accurate definition @xcite .",
    "e. t. jaynes has also commented that it is an unfortunate terminology , and a major occupational disease in that there exists a persistent failure to distinguished between the informational entropy , which is a property of any probability distribution , and the experimental entropy of thermodynamics , which is instead a property of the thermodynamic state : many research papers are flawed fatally by the authors failure to distinguish between these entirely different things , and in consequence providing nonsense results @xcite .",
    "along such erroneous line , recently it has been considered the utterly wrong proposition that a particular informational entropy  among the infinitely - many that can be defined  comes to supersede the boltzmann - gibbs one as the entropy of physical systems @xcite : such `` entropy '' has a form of the so - called structural havrda - charvat one @xcite , which is , we restate , a generating functional for deriving so - called heterotypical probability distributions @xcite to contour , as noticed , the difficulties of application of boltzmann - gibbs statistics when we face limitation ( ours , not of bg statistics ) in satisfying fisher s criteria in statistics @xcite .    as noticed in the abstract we present a systematization of these alternative statistics , dubbed _ unconventional statistical mechanics _ ( usm ) , within the variational formalism maxent - nesef ( for maximization of informational entropy in the non - equilibrium statistical ensemble formalism @xcite ) with the use of non - conventional statistical measures ( informational entropies ) to derive heterotypical nonequilibrium probability distributions",
    "this is discussed in the next section , and after that we illustrate the matter with the derivation of heterotypical fermi - dirac , bose - einstein , and maxwell - boltzmann single - particle distribution functions , and with a brief description of the application of usm in several situations including analysis of experimental data ( see also refs .",
    "in statistical mechanics the variational approach maxent - nesef  mentioned in the introduction  @xcite provides a powerful , practical and soundly based procedure , of a quite broad scope , for building a nonequilibrium ensemble formalism .",
    "it is encompassed in what is sometimes referred - to as _ informational - entropy optimization principles _ ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or , to be more precise , we would say _ constrained optimization _ , that is , restricted by constraints consisting in the available information .",
    "such optimization is performed through calculus of variation with lagrange s method for finding the constrained extremum being the preferred one .    in the conventional approach ,",
    "let it be in the cases of equilibrium @xcite , or nonequilibrium ( in the linear or onsagerian regime @xcite , or for arbitrarily far - from - equilibrium systems @xcite ) , one proceeds to maximize shannon - jaynes measure of information  or informational entropy which in equilibrium is gibbs entropy giving rise to boltzmann entropy in the microcanonical ensemble in equilibrium  , namely    @xmath0    under the given constraints .",
    "the calculus leads to statistical operators of an exponential form , with the exponent depending on the set of basic dynamical variables present in the constraints ( @xmath1 , see below ) , and the set of lagrange multipliers ( @xmath2 , see below ) , the latter being the nonequilibrium ( or equilibrium according to the case ) thermodynamic variables .",
    "in fact we must proceed to the maximization of the sj - informational entropy with the constraints    @xmath3    with @xmath4 .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is the normalization condition and eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) consists in the set of average values over the nonequilibrium ensemble ( characterized by the sought after statistical operator @xmath5 ) of the set of microdynamical variables @xmath6 chosen for providing the constraints in the variational method .",
    "the resulting statistical operator is given by @xcite    @xmath7    where    @xmath8    and    @xmath9    is the so - called informational - statistical - entropy operator @xcite , and @xmath10 is an auxiliary ( sometime called `` instantaneously frozen quasiequilibrium '' ) statistical operator having an exponential form resembling a canonical - like distribution @xcite . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath11 is the system hamiltonian , @xmath2 the set of lagrange multipliers associated to the set of basic microdynamical variables @xmath6 , and @xmath12 ensures the normalization condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and can be considered as being the logarithm of a nonequilibrium partition function , say , @xmath13 . moreover ,",
    "the term containing the positive infinitesimal @xmath14  which goes to zero after the calculation of averages has been performed ",
    "results from introducing abel s kernel ( in the convergence of integral transforms ) in the integral on time @xcite .",
    "we recall that it introduces in the theory the concept of bogoliubov s quasiaverages @xcite leading to irreversible evolution from an initial condition , what it does by selecting the retarded solutions of the liouville equation that @xmath15 satisfies : the advanced solutions are discarded in a quite similar way as done by gell - mann and goldberger in the case of schrdinger equation in scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the statistical operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) satisfies , as it should , the question of historicity  in kirkwood s and mori s sense @xcite  and irreversibility is introduced here in the so - called interventionistic picture in logic , resorting to krylov s `` jolting '' approach @xcite , using a poissonian distribution ( abel s kernel ) to account for the nonisolation of any physical system in the real world @xcite .    in that way it is built a general ensemble formalism in _ boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics _ for any kind of thermodynamic state of the system , and fundamental for the study of the physics of condensed matter : it allows to describe successfully any possible physical situation in many - body systems .",
    "of course , such success is possible if we are able to properly handle it , what means , as already mentioned , that in any problem we need to satisfy fisher s criteria @xcite for it to give satisfactory predictions .",
    "as noticed , we may face difficulties for some kind of situations where the use of bg statistics is simply impaired because of either becomes not possible to handle the required _ information relevant _ to the problem in hands , or , more important and fundamental , is involved a failure on the part of the theoretician to have a correct access to such information .",
    "typical cases are that of small systems ( few particles ) when we may not be satisfying fisher s criterion of efficiency ( fluctuations and higher - order variances can not be ignored ) , and the case of complex systems with some type or other of fractal - like structures or with long - range space correlations or particular long - time correlations , when we have deficiencies in the proper knowledge of the characterization of the states of the system ( failure to satisfy fisher s criterion of sufficiency ) .",
    "we reemphasize that what is present is a practical difficulty ( a limitation on the part of the theoretician ) in the otherwise complete , physically and logically sound bg - statistics , and this is illustrated in section iii .",
    "when facing such difficulties , out of necessity ( obstacles in accounting for the relevant information ) or , mainly , the force of circumstances ( lack of the proper characterization of the system ) a way to circumvent them has consisted into resorting to _ auxiliary ( or unconventional ) statistics _",
    "( see the first sentence in the introduction ) .",
    "this auxiliary unconventional statistical mechanics consists of two steps :    1 .   the choice of a _ heterotypical probability distribution _",
    ", obtained through application of maxent to different measures of information , that is , other than the shannon - jaynes one that leads to the conventional bg - statistics ; 2 .",
    "the use of the _ escort probability _ in terms of the chosen heterotypical probability of item 1 above , in the calculation of averages .",
    "let us consider both concepts .",
    "the escort probability of order @xmath16 of a given probability distribution @xmath17 is defined as    @xmath18    where @xmath16 is a positive real number , which seems to have been introduced by a. renyi but in terms of renyi s heterotypical probability distribution ( see ch .",
    "10 in the book of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , being generalized , and the name given , by c. beck and f. schlgl ( see ch . 5 in the book of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . its role is to add to the normal definition of average value the presence of second and higher - order variances ( in that way trying to improve upon the possible failure of distribution @xmath17 to satisfy fisher s criterion of efficiency ) : for the average value of an observable @xmath19 , if we write @xmath20 and make an expansion in powers of @xmath14 we find that    @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2 } \\left [ \\left < \\hat{a } \\hat{s } \\hat{s}\\right > - \\left < \\hat{a }   \\right>\\left <   \\hat{s } \\hat{s } \\right > + 2 \\left",
    "< \\hat{a }   \\right>\\left <   \\hat{s }   \\right>^2 - 2 \\left < \\hat{a } \\hat{s } \\right>\\left <   \\hat{s }   \\right >   \\right ] + \\mathcal{o } ( \\epsilon^3 ) , \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath22    stands for the normal average . for illustration",
    "let us take for @xmath19 the hamiltonian @xmath11 and for @xmath17 a canonical distribution @xmath23 , and then using eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) up to second order in @xmath24 it follows that the energy is given by    @xmath25    where    @xmath26    with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the second and the third order variances of the energy .",
    "the departure of @xmath16 from the value 1 gives an indication of the influence of the variances in the process of prediction of average values .    on the other hand , for obtaining the heterotypical distributions one needs to introduce alternative measures of information ( i.e. informational entropies ) .",
    "a large family is the one provided by i. csiszer ( @xcite and see also the book in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , among the infinitely - many possibilities , we list in table i five of them ( @xmath29 is the constant probability in the uniform distribution ) .",
    "klback - leibler measure @xcite , which is parameter independent , corresponds to shannon - jaynes informational entropy and produces the usual results in bg - statistics .",
    "the others are dependent on what has been dubbed as _ infoentropic index(es ) _ : the one of the havrda - charvat @xcite has been used in physics and other disciplines with the name of tsallis entropy @xcite ( calling @xmath30 the infoentropic index ) ; sharma - mittal informational entropy @xcite depends on two infoentropic indexes ( taking index @xmath31 it goes over the one of havrda - charvat , and for a particular relation between both indexes results kappa - statistics of refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which is a kind of weighted superposition of two havrda - charvat measures .",
    "renyi measure @xcite has been used in a number of problems in several disciplines , including physics @xcite ( it can be noticed that renyi and havrda - charvat measures produce , via maxent , the same statistical operator , differing only in the interpretation of the lagrange multipliers ) .",
    "kapur measure @xcite , depending on two infoentropic indexes is a superposition of two renyi measures .",
    "two important points need be stressed : on the one hand , shannon - klback - leibler measure is derived from a set of fundamental axioms , and havrda - charvat and renyi measures follow from the modification of one of such axioms @xcite . on the other hand , in the process",
    "is introduced an open parameter ( the infoentropic index @xmath32 , recently indicated by @xmath30 ) , to be determined by fitting of the index - dependent prediction with observation .",
    "the role of these heterotypical probability distributions is to introduce a selective weighting of , for example , occupation functions of quantum states , amplitudes of movement in hydrodynamics , etc .",

    "in this section we illustrate the use of the unconventional statistical mechanics described in the previous ones .",
    "we present comments on a few cases and is given the reference where details can be consulted .",
    "one example is the case of `` anomalous '' luminescence in semiconductor heterostructures , which requires the introduction of heterotypical fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "we begin with this case .",
    "there exists nowadays a large interest on the question of optical properties of quantum wells in semiconductor heterostructures , which have been extensively investigated in the last decades as they have large relevance for the high performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to deal with these kind of systems ,",
    "because of the constrained geometry that they present ( where phenomena develop in nanometer scales ) the researcher has to face difficulties with the theoretical analysis : a most relevant question to be dealt with is the one related to the interface roughness , usually having a kind of fractal - like structure which leads to energies and wavefunction depending on boundary conditions which need account for spatial correlations . as a consequence the different physical properties of these systems appear as , say , `` anomalous ''",
    "when the results are compared with those that are observed in bulk materials , particularly , the case of photoluminescence which we briefly describe here . in the study of photoluminescence in nanometric quantum wells",
    "the conventional treatment via the well established boltzmann - gibbs formalism has its application impaired because of the spatial correlations resulting from the non smooth confinement , relevant in the characterization of the system , on which one does not have access to ( obviously the interface roughness varies from sample to sample and one does not have any easy possibility to determine the topography of the interface ) .",
    "this is then the reason why the _ criterion of sufficiency _ is not satisfied in this case .",
    "let us consider a system of carriers ( electrons and holes ) produced , in the quantum well of an heterostructure , by a ultrafast laser pulse .",
    "they are out of equilibrium and their nonequilibrium macroscopic state can be described in terms of a nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics @xcite , with the nonequilibrium thermodynamic state characterized by the time evolving quantities energy and density ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . electrons and holes do recombine producing a luminescence spectrum which , we recall , is theoretically expressed as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the populations of electrons and holes , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the frequency of the emitted photon and @xmath51 the energy gap , and @xmath52 are the electron ( hole ) individual energy levels in the quantum well ( index @xmath53 for the discrete levels and @xmath54 for the free movement in the @xmath55 plane ) , and the delta function accounts for energy conservation .",
    "the textbook expression for the energy levels corresponding to the use of perfectly smooth bidimentional boundaries is given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the quantum - well width and @xmath58 is the effective mass and the populations @xmath59 take a form that resembles instantaneous in time fermi - dirac distributions : see ch . 6 in the book of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . using this expression in the calculation of @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) and comparing it with the experimental results @xcite one finds a disagreement , and then it is used the name of `` anomalous '' luminescence for these experimental results .",
    "this is a consequence that we are using an improper description of the carriers energy levels  we are not satisfying the _ criterion of sufficiency _ ( as discussed in previous sections )  , resulting of ignoring the roughness of the boundaries ( with self - affine fractal structure @xcite ) which needs be taken into account in these nanometric - scale geometries , and then the boundary conditions to be placed on the wavefunctions are space dependent .",
    "hence complicated space correlations are to be introduced , but to which we do not have access ( information ) , as already noticed .",
    "hence , this limitation on the part of the researcher breaks the sufficiency criterion , and application of the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon - jaynes construction is impaired , and one can try to circumvent the difficulty introducing unconventional statistics based on parameter - dependent structural informational entropies in order to analyze the properties of the system .      according to eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) what we need is to express the carrier populations in a heterotypical statistics , and we resort to the renyi one ( see for example ref .",

    "this is a clear consequence that the fractal - like granulation of the boundary surface becomes less and less relevant for influencing the outcome of the phenomenon , as the width of the quantum well falls outside the nanometer scale , and is approached the situation of a normal bulk sample . on the other hand the kinetic temperature of the carriers is smaller with increasing quantum well width , as also expected once the relaxation processes , mainly as a result of the interaction with the phonon system , become more effective and the cooling down of the hot carriers proceeds more rapidly .",

    "voltammetry the resulting current between electrodes is determined by the charges arriving at the fractal electrode in a process of hydrodynamic motion .",
    "characterizing such motion as a fickian diffusion fails to explain the experimental data , what can be done using a postulated law of `` anomalous '' diffusion @xcite .",
    "the use of the latter is , as noticed before , a fitting procedure in a situation that requires a higher - order thermo - hydrodynamics ( motion of the fluid of charges in the nano- and subnanometric spaces around the surface of the fractal - like structured electrode ) . the use of a zeroth - order thermo - hydrodynamics  the one leading to fickian diffusion equations in a bg thermo - statistics",

    "( [ eq50 ] ) .",
    "here we only noticed that , keeping fixed all physical characteristics in the experiment , if the morphology of the fractal electrode surface is modified , it can be established a relation between renyi infoentropic index and the average fractal dimension @xmath184 in the form    @xmath185    we recall that values of @xmath32 are permitted in the interval @xmath186 ( otherwise the theory gives rise to singularities ) , now a clear physical restriction once then @xmath187 as it should .",

    "moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ eq54 ] ) we can clearly see that the infoentropic index @xmath32 depends on the system dynamics , its geometry and size , and the thermodynamic state .",
    "finally , we briefly mention the case of black - body radiation in insufficient description .",
    "we consider the gas of photons in the presence of an uniform flux of energy ( generated , for example , as a result of the presence of different temperatures at both ends of the container ) .",
    "we look for the calculation of the energy what is done , on the one side , using the conventional approach in a description that includes the energy and the energy flux as basic variables ( that is , in a first - order thermo - hydrodynamics ; see discussion on higher - order thermo - hydrodynamics earlier in this section ) and , on the other side , using an incomplete description including only the energy ( zeroth - order thermo - hydrodynamics ) but dealt with using renyi statistics trying to compensate for the insufficiency of description .",
    "details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and here we only notice that equating the values of the energy in both descriptions , it follows that the infoentropic index is given by    @xmath199    where @xmath60 is the energy flux and @xmath200 with @xmath201 being stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "it can be noticed that @xmath202 is a kind of a flux of energy composed of the energy density of the radiation , @xmath203 , traversing at the speed of light , while @xmath60 is roughly the density of energy traversing at a speed determined by the gradient of temperature , and then @xmath204 is very small , and then the infoentropic index is practically 1 meaning that the insufficiency in the characterization can be ignored .",
    "however the enormous success and large application of shannon - jaynes approach to derive the probability distributions of the ensemble formalism in the laplace - maxwell - boltzmann - gibbs statistical foundations of physics , as it has been noticed , some cases are difficult to be properly handled within such formulation , as a result of existing some kind of fuzziness in data or information , that is , the presence of conditions of insufficiency in the characterization of the ( microscopic , macroscopic or mesoscopic ) state of the system . such difficulty with the proper characterization of the system in the problem in hands can be somehow compensated , as shown , with the introduction of peculiar parameter - dependent alternative informational - entropies ( see table i ) , allowing for the construction of a vast number of auxiliary heterotypical statistics .",
    "_ in that way one recovers the ability to make improved predictions on the properties of the system , and be capable to get a picture of the physical processes involved _ allowing , as for example illustrated in section iii , to evaluate the influence of peculiar characteristics of the sample ( like , e.g. , its fractal structure ) on its physico - chemical behavior .",
    "returning to the question of the possible failure to satisfy fisher s criteria of efficiency and sufficiency , in the case of particularly dealing with systems with some kind of fractal - like structure the use of shannon - jaynes infoentropy would require to introduce as information the highly correlated conditions that are in that case present .",
    "two examples in condensed matter physics have been described in the previous section in which fractality enters via the non - smooth topography of the boundary surfaces which have large influence on phenomena occurring in constrained geometries ( nanometer scales in the active region of the sample ) .",
    "hence the most general and complete boltzmann - gibbs formalism in shannon - jaynes approach becomes hampered out and is difficult to handle , and then , as shown , use of other types of informational - entropies leads to the derivation of heterotypical probability distributions on the basis of the constrained maximization of unconventional informational - statistical entropies ( quantity of uncertainty of information ) , to be accompanied , as noticed in the main text , with the use of the so - called escort probabilities , allowing for an analysis and understanding of the observed physical behavior of the system .    summarizing , _ unconventional statistical mechanics consists of two steps : 1 .",
    "the choice of a deemed appropriate structural informational - entropy for generating the heterotypical statistical operator , and 2 .",
    "the use of a escort probability in terms of the heterotypical distribution of item 1 .",
    "_    as shown in the main text , and illustrated in section iii , the _ escort probability _ introduces corrections to an inefficient description by including correlations and higher - order variances of the observables involved . on the other hand , the _ heterotypical distribution _",
    "introduces corrections to the insufficient description by modifying the statistical weight of the dynamical states of the conventional approach involved in the situation under consideration .",
    "moreover , we have considered a particular case , namely the statistics as derived from the use of renyi informational entropy , centering the attention on the derivation of an unconventional statistical mechanics appropriate for dealing with far - removed - from - equilibrium systems .",
    "moreover , we have reported the calculation , in such conditions , of the distribution functions of single fermions and bosons , the counterpart in these unconventional statistics of the usual fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions : these distributions are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .    in conclusion , we may say that usm appears as a valuable approach , in which the introduction of informational - entropic - indexes - dependent informational - entropies leads to a particularly convenient and sophisticated method for studying certain classes of physical systems for which the criteria of efficiency and sufficiency in its characterization can not be properly satisfied .",
    "finally , it is relevant to emphasize again the fact that the infoentropic index(es ) is(are ) dependent on the dynamics involved , the system s geometry and dimensions , boundary conditions , its macroscopic - thermodynamic state ( in equilibrium , or out of it when becomes a function of time ) , and the experimental protocol .    also , we recall the fundamental point , stressed in the introduction , that these informational entropies ( informational measures ) are not at all to be interpreted as the physico - thermal entropy of the system .",
