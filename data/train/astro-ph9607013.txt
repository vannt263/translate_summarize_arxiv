    "we urge readers who are familiar with solar neutrino research to turn immediately to section  [ summary ] , which contains a concise summary and discussion of our analysis of what can be learned about neutrino properties from studying solar neutrino lines .",
    "we do not discuss here what can be learned about the solar interior from studying neutrino linesbe solar neutrino line is equivalent to a measuremnt of the central temperature of the sun and a measurement of the energy profile of the @xmath0be line will determine the temperature profile of the solar interior . ] .",
    "continuum neutrino sources , principally neutrinos from @xmath2b decay and from the @xmath3 reaction , are believed to be the major contributors to the four pioneering solar neutrino experiments : chlorine@xcite , kamiokande@xcite , gallex@xcite , and sage@xcite . moreover , the two next - generation experiments , superkamiokande@xcite and sno@xcite , are both sensitive only to the neutrino continuum from @xmath2b decay .",
    "the four pioneering detectors have established experimentally that the sun shines by nuclear fusion reactions among light elements .",

    "all of the particle physics solutions of the solar neutrino problem predict a survival probability , the probability that an electron - type neutrino remains an electron - type neutrino , that is different from unity .",
    "in contrast , the survival probability is equal to unity in the simplest version of standard electroweak theory@xcite .",
    "two new experiments , sno and superkamiokande , were designed with the goal in mind of establishing definitively if physics beyond the standard electroweak model is required to explain the results of solar neutrino experiments . moreover , these new experiments will have the potential to determine the total flux ( independent of flavor ) of @xmath2b solar neutrinos , thereby testing the prediction by solar models of the flux for this rare mode of neutrino production .",
    "the most plausible particle physics explanations , resonant matter oscillations@xcite ( the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein , or msw , effect ) and vacuum neutrino oscillations@xcite , both predict a strong energy dependence for the survival probability .",
    "the form of the energy dependence is determined by the specific parameters used in the adopted oscillation scenario .",
    "other suggested new particle physics explanations that predict a strong energy dependence for the survival probability include neutrino decay @xcite , non - standard electromagnetic properties @xcite , neutrino violation of the equivalence principle @xcite , and supersymmetric flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "many of the relevant papers ( and further references ) are reprinted in @xcite .",
    "we explore in this paper what can be learned about neutrino physics by performing experiments with solar neutrino lines .",
    "measurements with solar neutrino lines have the advantage that the predictions of particle physics models are more specific for a line source than they are for a continuum source . measurements of continuum interaction rates determine a weighted average of what happens to neutrinos of different energies .",
    "moreover , if a neutrino line is detected in two ways ( e.g. , by neutrino - electron scattering and by neutrino absorption ) then the survival probability at a specific energy can be determined empirically , independent of any solar physics . at any energy , a measured value for",
    "the survival probability that is significantly different from unity would constitute evidence for electron flavor non - conservation .",

    "the branching ratio of 9:1 is determined by nuclear physics and is the same in the laboratory and in the solar interior .",

    "if neutrino oscillations occur , the predicted standard model ratio of @xmath0be to @xmath1 neutrino fluxes may be much reduced .",
    "so far , borexino@xcite , which will observe neutrino - electron scattering , is the only detector in an advanced stage of development that is being constructed with a goal of isolating events from a solar neutrino line .",
    "two other experiments are being developed , hellaz@xcite and heron@xcite , which have the potential to detect solar neutrino lines via neutrino - electron scattering .",

    "we calculate the predicted electron recoil spectrum in neutrino - electron scattering experiments for four different neutrino oscillation scenarios and for the standard model ( no oscillations , standard solar model ) .",
    "we then show to what extent measurements of the scattering rate for neutrino lines can be used to help determine neutrino masses and mixing angles .",

    "we assume successively the validity of either the small mixing angle ( sma ) or the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solutions@xcite , or the vacuum ( vac ) neutrino oscillation solution@xcite .",

    "even greater enhancements in the predicted event rates , a factor of 7 or more , are implied by the cno scenario in the region @xmath34 mev to @xmath35 mev , in which the electron recoils from scattering by the @xmath1 neutrino line are found .",
    "we begin this subsection by stating an important result that refers to all three of the neutrino oscillation scenarios . by a series of detailed calculations",
    ", we have found that a measurement of the electron scattering rate of either the @xmath0be @xmath36 mev line or the @xmath1 line to an accuracy of @xmath37% would , in conjunction with the four operating experiments , essentially eliminate the two competing oscillation scenarios that are assumed , for purpose of that particular simulation , not to be correct .",

    "the large mixing angle solution is also allowed .",
    "a measurement of the scattering rate of neutrinos from the @xmath36 mev @xmath0be line would , with the given assumptions , eliminate the large mixing angle solution and reduce significantly the allowed area of the small mixing angle solution .",

    "the electron recoil spectra expected , see figure  [ recoilspectrum ] , are different depending upon whether the sun shines by @xmath3 or cno fusion reactions . if the cno cycle is the dominant source of energy generation , the expected event rate is larger in the region in which the electron recoil energy is less than @xmath33 mev and the shape and energy span of the recoil electron energy spectrum is different , than would be expected if @xmath3 reactions are most important source of solar energy generation .",
