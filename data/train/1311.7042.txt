    "despite many efforts the phase transition ( pt ) thermodynamics of finite systems is far from being completed .",
    "its consistent formulation remains a real theoretical challenge for the researchers working in statistical mechanics . on the other hand , nowadays it is of great practical importance since at intermediate and high energies the modern nuclear physics is dealing with the phase transformations of liquid - gas type occurring in finite or even small systems . the central issue of this field is related to a rigorous definition of finite volume analogs of phases .",
    "the first attempt @xcite to rigorously define the gaseous and liquid phases in finite systems was based on the properties of phases existing in infinite systems in which two phases coexist at phase equilibrium and generate two local maxima , i.e. a bimodality , of some order parameter .",
    "each maximum is associated with a pure phase @xcite . since a few years ago",
    "such a concept of nuclear liquid - gas pt @xcite completely dominates in nuclear physics of intermediate energies .",
    "it considers the bimodal distributions as a robust signal of a pt in finite systems .",
    "however , this concept does not seem to be correct since in a finite system an analog of mixed phase is not just a simple mixture of two pure phases as it is explicitly shown within an exactly solvable statistical model @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate that in finite and infinite systems the bimodal distributions can appear without a pt and , hence , they can not serve as robust signal of a pt in finite systems .",
    "the simplified statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) which has no coulomb and no asymmetry energy was exactly solved in thermodynamic limit in @xcite , while its generalization constrained for finite systems , the csmm , was solved in @xcite . for",
    "a volume @xmath0 the grand canonical partition of the csmm can be identically written as @xcite @xmath1^{-1 } } \\ , , % % \\ ] ] where the set of @xmath2 @xmath3 are all the roots of the equation @xmath4 .",
    "the volume spectrum of our model @xmath5 depends on the eigen volume @xmath6 of a nucleon at the normal nuclear density @xmath7 @xmath8 taken at @xmath9 and zero pressure , mass @xmath10 mev , degeneracy factor @xmath11 of nucleons and it is defined as @xmath12 here @xmath13 $ ] is a reduced distribution function of the @xmath14-nucleon fragment , @xmath15 is the fisher topological exponent and @xmath16 is the @xmath17-dependent surface tension coefficient .",
    "usually , the constant , parameterizing the dimension of surface in terms of the volume is @xmath18 . in the expression for @xmath5 the maximal size of fragment",
    "is denoted as @xmath19 . in the usual smm @xcite and in its simplified version smm",
    "the nuclear liquid pressure @xmath20 corresponds to an incompressible matter .",
    "since this is in contradiction with the experimental heavy ions collisions data @xcite , here we analyze the following equation of state with non - zero compressibility @xmath21 which contains an additional term to the usual smm liquid pressure . here",
    "an integer power is @xmath22 or @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the usual temperature dependent binding energy per nucleon with @xmath25 mev @xcite , while the constants @xmath26 , @xmath27 mev@xmath28 and @xmath29 mev@xmath30 are fixed in order to reproduce the properties of normal nuclear matter , i.e. at vanishing temperature @xmath9 and normal nuclear density @xmath31 the liquid pressure must be zero . under a new ansatz for @xmath32",
    "the nuclear liquid of csmm becomes compressible @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the proposed parameterization @xcite shows that it is fully consistent with the l. van hove axioms of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "in addition to a more general parameterization of the bulk free energy of nuclear fragments we also consider a more general parameterization of the surface tension coefficient @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev the smm .",
    "in contrast to the fisher droplet model @xcite and the usual smm @xcite , the csmm surface tension ( 4 ) is negative above the critical temperature @xmath37 .",
    "an extended discussion on the validity of such a parameterization can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in the csmm there is always a single solution @xmath40 of the equation @xmath41 , but it can be of two kinds @xcite : either the gaseous pole @xmath42 for @xmath43 or the liquid essential singularity @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "this model has a pt which occurs when the gaseous pole is changed by the liquid essential singularity or vice versa .",
    "the pt curve @xmath46 is a solution of the equation @xmath47 , which is just the gibbs criterion of phase equilibrium .",
    "the properties of a pt are defined only by the liquid phase pressure @xmath48 and by the temperature dependence of surface tension @xmath49 .",
    "the phase diagram of the present model in thermodynamic limit in the plane of baryonic chemical potential @xmath50 and temperature @xmath17 is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : saguni ] .",
    "the treatment of the model for finite volumes is more complicated , since the roots @xmath51 of ( [ saguni ] ) have not only the real part @xmath52 , but an imaginary part @xmath53 as well ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , equation for @xmath2 can be cast as a system of coupled transcendental equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath55   \\cos(i_n b k)\\ , , % \\\\",
    "% \\label{sagunvii } % & & \\hspace*{-0.cm } i_n = - \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{k(v ) } \\phi_k ( t ) % ~\\exp \\left [ \\frac{re ( \\nu_n)\\,k}{t } \\right ]   \\sin(i_n b k)\\ , , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for convenience we introduced the following set of the effective chemical potentials @xmath56 @xmath57 and the reduced distribution for nucleons @xmath58 .",
    "consider the real root @xmath59 , first .",
    "the real root @xmath60 of the csmm exists for any @xmath17 and @xmath50 . from ( [ saguni ] ) and ( [ sagunvi ] ) for @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "one can see that @xmath63 is a constrained grand canonical pressure of the mixture of ideal gases with the chemical potential @xmath64 .",
    "hence , a single real solution @xmath60 with @xmath62 of the system ( [ sagunvi ] , [ sagunvii ] ) corresponds to a gaseous phase ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "if for some thermodynamic parameters we have a real solution @xmath40 and any finite number @xmath65 of the complex conjugate pairs of roots @xmath66 , then such a system corresponds to a finite volume analog of mixed phase @xcite . note that , each pair of complex conjugate roots @xmath66 represents a metastable state with a complex value of chemical potential @xmath67 . since @xmath68 these metastable states are not in a true chemical equilibrium with the gas and with each other .",
    "a finite system analog of a liquid phase corresponds to an infinite number of the complex roots of the system ( [ sagunvi ] , [ sagunvii ] ) , but in finite system it exists at infinite pressure only . using these definitions , one can build up the finite system analog of the @xmath69 phase diagram ( see the right panel of fig.1 ) .    therefore , in contrast to assumptions of refs .",
    "@xcite , in finite systems the pure liquid phase can not exist at finite pressures .",
    "instead , in finite system and finite pressures we are dealing with the finite volume analogs of gaseous or mixed phases @xcite .      in this section",
    "we discuss another typical mistake of the approaches @xcite based on the bimodal properties of the first order pt in finite systems .",
    "the authors of @xcite implicitly assume that , like in the infinite systems , in finite systems there exist exactly two ` pure ' phases and they exactly correspond to two peaks in the bimodal distribution of the order parameter .",
    "as two counterexamples to these assumptions we present the bimodal fragment distributions obtained for an infinite system at the supercritical temperature where the surface tension coefficient is negative ( the left panel of fig.2 ) and the one obtained inside the finite volume analog of a gaseous phase corresponding to positive values of the effective chemical potential @xmath64 ( the right panel of fig.2 ) . as one can see from fig.2 , in contrast to expectations of @xcite , the bimodal fragment distributions occur without a pt .",
    "a novel version of the csmm is presented here .",
    "its detailed analysis is performed in order to clarify an origin of the bimodality appearing both in finite and in infinite systems .",
    "an exact analytical solution of the present model allows us to perform a robust analysis of the fragment size distributions in the regions where there is and there is no pt .",
    "it is shown that the fragment size distribution can be bimodal - like inside of the finite volume analog of gaseous phase .",
    "also we demonstrate that a bimodal fragment size distribution can be caused by negative values of the surface tension and , hence , it is not a robust signal of pt existence in finite systems .",
