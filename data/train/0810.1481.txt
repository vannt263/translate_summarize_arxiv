    "what is reasoned on is the agent s internal knowledge structure . for the agent",
    ", knowledge is gained as new evidence from the world is discovered ( either through direct perception or through communication ) or as knowledge is inferred given the agent s internal reasoning system .",
    "the non - axiomatic reasoning system ( nars ) is an example of an evidential reasoning system @xcite .",
    "the data structure proposed for nars version 2.2 is a directed evidence network denoted @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is a set of vertices , @xmath11 is a set of directed  inheritance \" edges , and @xmath12 , [ 0,1 ] { \\rangle}$ ] maps each edge to an evidence tuple .",
    "for example , an edge is denoted @xmath13 where @xmath4 is the tail of the inheritance edge , @xmath5 is the head of the inheritance edge , and @xmath14 is the evidence tuple for that edge .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath16 is that there is @xmath17 positive evidence supporting the claim that @xmath4 @xmath18 @xmath5 and @xmath19 negative evidence that @xmath4 @xmath18 @xmath5 .",
    "another interpretation of this edge is that , upon examination , it appears , to the agent , that @xmath4 has @xmath17 properties in common with @xmath5 and @xmath19 properties not in common with @xmath5 .",
    "this idea is also expressed as @xmath4 being the intension of @xmath5 and @xmath5 being the extension of @xmath4 @xcite .    in nars ,",
    "the evidence tuple of an edge is revised by means of external perception or internal reasoning .",
    "the act of perceiving @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the external world will return evidence of their relationship and thus , increment @xmath17 or @xmath19 accordingly .",
    "with respect to internal reasoning , there are four syllogisms that can be applied to the agent s internal knowledge network : deduction , induction , abduction @xcite , and exemplification . for deduction , @xmath20 for induction , @xmath21 for abduction ,",
    "@xmath22 finally , there is a less widely used fourth syllogism known as exemplification @xcite .",
    "exemplification is defined as @xmath23 the values for @xmath24 depend upon the specific inference rules of the the evidential reasoner . in @xcite",
    ", it is explicitly stated that the rules presented are not set in stone , but rather subject to revision themselves as more is understood about the design of evidential systems .",
    "the evidence tuple @xmath14 of an edge can be transformed into a normalized  truth value \" consisting of a new tuple @xmath25 , \\emptyset \\cup [ 0,1 ] { \\rangle}$ ] .",
    "the first component @xmath26 is the frequency of positive evidence and is defined as @xmath27 the second component @xmath28 is the confidence in the stability of @xmath26 as @xmath6-more observations are made and is defined as @xmath29 the parameter @xmath30 is a user - defined , system constant . in words , as more positive evidence accumulates relative to negative evidence , @xmath26 increases towards @xmath31 . as more total evidence accumulates relative to some constant @xmath6 , @xmath28 increases towards @xmath31 .",
    "if there is no evidence , then the edge has an @xmath26-component of @xmath32 which means that the relationship is unknown .",
    "finally , hard  truth \" can be modeled with an evidence tuple of @xmath33 with @xmath34 and thus , an @xmath35-tuple of @xmath36 .",
    "the contribution of this article is to extend the aforementioned evidential logic framework to multi - relational networks composed of both inheritance and non - inheritance edges .",
    "moreover , this article contributes an algebraic ring formulation of evidential reasoning which situates the reasoner within well understood mathematics . from this multi - relational foundation",
    ", evidential reasoning can be comfortably executed in the rdf - rich world of the semantic web .",
    "a path algebra to map a multi - relational network to a single - relational form was originally presented in @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind the algebra was to provide a formal means by which the large class of single - relational network analysis algorithms could be applied to multi - relational networks in a meaningful way .",
    "with respect to this article , the binary operations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are updated so as to work with evidence tuples .    a multi - relational , evidence network is defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath1 is a set of vertices , @xmath40 is a family of edge sets , and @xmath41 , [ 0,1 ] { \\rangle}$ ] maps each edge in @xmath42 to an evidence tuple .",
    "the algebraic formulation of the presented evidential path algebra operates on an @xmath43 tensor representation of this network @xcite adjacency matrix  slices \" , where each matrix has its own label . ] .",
    "the evidence tensor @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 the two @xmath46 dimensions represent the vertices and the single @xmath47 dimension represents the various edge labels .",
    "thus , there is a one - to - one mapping between a multi - relational , evidence network and an evidence tensor .",
    "the entries of the tensor denote the amount of positive ( @xmath17 ) and negative ( @xmath19 ) evidence for the edge @xmath8 , where @xmath48 denotes no evidence when no such edge exists .",

    "the binary operation @xmath37 is associative , has an identity of @xmath53 , and is commutative .",
    "the binary operation @xmath38 is associative with an identity of @xmath54 .",
    "the operation @xmath37 supports the notion that evidence ( from two independent experiences / inferences ) can be summed together @xcite .",
    "the operation @xmath38 supports the notion that positive evidence can be multiplied to form new positive evidence and that conflicting and negative evidence accounts for negative evidence .    the next subsections will formalize the various syllogisms on inheritance edges in a multi - relational network and then the following subsection will discuss the application of these operations to any arbitrary path through an evidence tensor .",
    "note that what is presented is a set of operations that will operate on @xmath55 matrix  slices \" of the evidence tensor . in this respect ,",
    "the presented operations are  global \" computations and thus , are computationally inefficient and contrary to aikir",
    ". however , these operations can be implemented as  local \" computations using various methods such grammar walks @xcite in specific areas of the network because evidential reasoning does not require a network - wide computation .",

    "at the point of insertion , it is possible to revise the evidence tuple for @xmath92 based upon the idea that self - citations in an article are considered evidence for authorship of that article @xcite .",

    "given this scenario , the following inference rule will update all @xmath92 evidence according to inferred self - citation evidence : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the current time step , @xmath97  clips \" the evidence in @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the entry - wise hadamard multiplication operation[multiblock footnote omitted ] , and @xmath100 is the evidential identity matrix @xmath101 in words , the self - citation inference rule states that evidence for @xmath98 can be modulated by the total evidence for the path that goes from an author , to their written articles , to the articles that those articles cite , and then finally , to the authors of those cited articles .",
    "however , in order to ensure that those cited authors are the original author from the start of the path ( i.e.  self - citation ) , it is important to filter on the identity matrix @xmath100 .",

    "note that the transpose of an evidence matrix , not the converse transpose of the evidence matrix , is used when taking the converse of a non - inheritance statement .",
    "the reason for this is that the positive and negative evidence for the statement  marko wrote this article \" is the same for  this article was written by marko \" .",
    "next , inferred evidence for @xmath92 must be independent of the evidence used to calculate it .",

    "the reason for the @xmath105 filter is that to represent a @xmath94 path from a person to their authored papers and then to _ other _ authors of those papers , the path must exclude the original author as an author is not a coauthor of themselves .",

    "it is important to note that the matrix formalism presented in this article is very much intractable as the best known algorithm to compute ordinary matrix multiplication is approximately @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "as stated previously , this matrix model can be approximated using various techniques such as grammar walk algorithms which do not compute the inferences over the entire network , but instead , on local subgraphs ( i.e.  paths starting from particular vertices ) @xcite . with evidential logic",
    ", such walks can be executed when resources are available and only in those areas of the knowledge network where it is deemed necessary ( e.g.  @xmath107 and/or low @xmath28 areas ) .    finally , to actually represent a multi - relational , evidence network in rdf and on the semantic web , some form of reification can be used .",
    "a popular technique is the quad - form of a  triple \" where a statement maintains a fourth component known as a named graph @xcite .",
    "with reification , statements can be attached to statements and thus , a @xmath14 evidence tuple can be assigned to an rdf statement .",
    "this article presented a non - axiomatic evidential logic that can be implemented within the constructs of rdf and thus , can be used as an evidential reasoning system in the semantic web .",
    "the benefit of this system is that it works with arbitrary , partial , and contradictory knowledge while , at the same time , in a non - matrix implementation , supports a tractable approximate reasoning process .",
