    "a small sub - class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is known as blazars .",
    "bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) collectively known as blazars .",
    "optical spectrum of bl lac objects are featureless i.e. absence of prominent emission or absorption lines , whereas fsrqs show prominent emission lines .",
    "the common properties of blazars include large amplitude violent flux variation in complete electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum , high and variable polarization from radio to optical bands , core - dominated radio morphology , and emission being predominantly nonthermal .",
    "blazars emit relativistic charged particle jets which pointed close ( at angles @xmath2 10@xmath3 ) to our line of sight ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) and it causes the observed emission to be relativistically beamed .",
    "since blazars emit radiation in the complete em spectrum , these are among ideal objects to study their multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the sed of blazars show two well defined broad spectral components ( mukherjee et al .",
    "based on the location of these sed peaks , blazars are further classified into low energy peaked blazars ( lbls ) and high energy peaked blazars ( hbls ) . in lbls the first sed component peaks in radio to optical while the second component peaks at gev energies , and in hbls the first component peaks in uv / x - rays while the second component peaks at tev energies ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) .",
    "recently blazars classification is made on synchrotron peak frequency and divided into three sub - classes i.e low synchrotron peaked ( lsps ) , intermediate synchrotron peaked ( isps ) and high energy peaked blazars ( hsps ) ( abdo et al .",
    "basically lsps and isps collectively belong to lbls class .    * table 1 .",
    "* observation log of xmm - newton x - ray data for low energy peaked blazars@xmath4    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^ , < , > \" , ]      + @xmath5 signal to noise ratio of the data , @xmath6 not significant detection , @xmath7 border line detection , + @xmath8 log of flux in the energy range 0.310 kev , calculated using the tool  webpimms \" provided by nasa s heasarc considering a power law spectra with galactic absorption .",
    "we searched for x  ray idv in the lcs of almost all the lsps observed by xmm ",
    "newton since its launch .",
    "the details of the observation log is given in table 1 which gives the data of 9 lsps and 2 isps with total 25 lcs .",
    "all the lcs are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . there were 25 lcs of lsp 3c 273 which are already presented in table 1 and fig . 1 of kalita et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . in table 2",
    ", we report the results of variability parameters of all 50 lcs which are calculated using excess variance .",
    "it is clear from table 2 that in only two pointings , one of the isp s5 0716 + 714 and another one of lsp pks 0235 + 164 , we found significant idv with variability amplitude of 23 and 11.6% , respectively . since , s5 0716 + 714 is observed in outburst state and is an isp , it could be expected that the synchrotron peak of this blazar reaches up to soft x - ray regime .",
    "similarly , pks 0235 + 164 is also found to shift its peak up to soft x - ray region in its outburst state ( madejsi et al .",
    "hence , in these two occasions , we expect to get the variability in x - ray band .",
    "in other pointings , we did not find any significant variability .",
    "most of the sources listed in table 1 .",
    "are well known lsps and are extensively monitored in optical bands and they have shown high duty cycles in optical bands up to @xmath1 7080% ( gupta et al . 2008 , 2012 ;",
    "goyal et al .",
    "2012 ; agarwal et al .",
    "2015 ; gaur et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) .",
    "similarly , idv of hsps in x - ray band is well studied and are highly variable in these bands ( lachowicz et al .",
    "2009 ; gaur et al .",
    "2010 ; kalita et al .",
    "2015 ; and references therein ) but not very extensively studied in optical bands .",
    "till now , we put an extensive effort to observe the optical idv of hsps and found these sources to be less variable in these bands .",
    "the difference in the multi - frequency spectral properties of hsps and lsps requires a systematic change of intrinsic physical parameters such as magnetic field , jet size , maximum electron energy and it is investigated by sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the change is in the sense that hsps have higher magnetic fields / electron energies and smaller sizes as compared to lsps .",
    "all the above factors lead to the difference in the cut off energies of lsps and hsps and hence have a more retarded effect on the x - ray variability of lsps .",
    "isps lies in between these two classes and is difficult to mark the exact boundaries as it depends on the state of the source i.e whether it is in quiescent / outburst state .",
    "the variations in the acceleration efficiency of the relativistic electrons near the synchrotron hump could arise from the changes in the local number density of the most energetic electrons or the strength of the localized magnetic fields . near the peak of the sed , acceleration processes dominates and produces the higher energy electrons while the lower energy electrons are available for the emission below the sed peaks . below the sed peak ,",
    "probably cooling processes dominate which involve mainly inverse compton for lsps in general ( joshi et al .",
    "since , the most excepted model for the intra - day variability involves magneto - hydrodynamic instabilities ; presence of turbulence behind or in the vicinity of the shock ( marscher , gear & travis 1992 ) ; hence one can expect that the x - ray variability would be more pronounced for hsps as compared to lsps which is confirmed from our observations .",
    "these differences can lead to the apparent dichotomy between these two classes of blazars however we need statistically more observations to firmly conclude our findings .",
    "we thank the referee for important comments and suggestions which helped us to improve the manuscript .",
