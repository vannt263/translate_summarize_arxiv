    "the mr acquires the so - called slow oscillations @xcite and the phase shift of beats.@xcite these two effects are missed by the standard 3d theory abrik , shoenberg , ziman because they appear in the higher orders in @xmath18 .",
    "these slow oscillations ( slo ) originate not from small fs pockets , but from the finite interlayer hopping , because the product of oscillations with two close frequencies @xmath5 gives oscillations with frequency @xmath19 .",

    "first , they survive at much higher temperature than mqo .",
    "second , they are not sensitive to a long - range disorder , which damps the fast mqo similarly to finite temperature due to a spatial variation of the fermi energy . therefore , the dingle factor and the amplitude of slo may be much larger than those of usual mqo @xcite .",
    "third , the slo allow to measure the interlayer transfer integral @xmath3 and the in - plane fermi momentum @xmath21 .",

    ", the slo were investigated only for the _ interlayer _ conductivity @xmath22 , when the current and the magnetic field are both applied perpendicularly to the 2d layers , and only in organic compounds @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the most of q2d compounds , including pnictide high - temperature superconductors , as a rule , have the shape of very thin flakes for which correct measurements of the intralayer conductivity are reliable , especially in the case of good metallic properties of studied compounds .",
    "very often the crystal consists of a stack of bilayers . in this case",
    "there are two types of interlayer hopping integrals : the larger , @xmath23 , is between adjacent layers inside one bilayer , and the smaller one , @xmath24 , is between bilayers .",
    "correspondingly , one may expect two types of slo originating from the bilayer and interbilayer electron hopping .",
    "the slo from bilayer splitting have not yet been studied .",

    "in addition to hosting incommensurate cdws , magnetic rare - earth ions exhibit closed - spaced magnetic phase transitions below 10 k @xcite leading to coexistence and competition of many ordered states at low temperatures . therefore , any information about the fermi surface on such small energy scale beyond the arpes resolution@xcite is very important .",
    "an accurate measurement of @xmath3 as function of temperature , provided by slo , is also useful in these compounds . for the possible observation of the slo the rare - earth tritellurides are very promising , because they have the appropriate anisotropy and good metallic conductivity up to low temperatures .",
    "these compounds well illustrate our goal : in addition to good metallic properties , their available single crystals have a very flat shape , allowing correct measurements of the intralayer conductivity @xcite .",
    "note that the rte@xmath26 compounds have a doubled bilayer crystal structure , since there are two non - equivalent te bilayers in one elementary cell .",
