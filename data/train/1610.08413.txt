    "it finds a number of applications to physics : in nonlinear optics @xcite , in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , in plasma physics and others @xcite ) .",
    "we specially mention some of them @xcite , which are closer to the types of interactions we consider .",
    "therefore it is an important problem to study the soliton interaction of ( [ eq : vnls ] ) in the adiabatic approximation for multicomponent nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "this task has been started some time ago in @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite .",
    "first , it was proved that a generalized version of the complex toda chain ( ctc ) @xcite describes rather well the @xmath8-soliton train behavior for wide set of soliton parameters . since this generalized",
    "ctc is also integrable it allows one also to predict the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath8-soliton train for @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical tests comparing the trajectories of the solitons obtained as numerical solution of ( [ eq : vnls ] ) with the trajectories predicted by the ctc showed an excellent agreement for up to 9-soliton trains .",
    "the perturbed mm also finds a number of applications .",
    "for example , the equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an external potential can be viewed as one - dimensional model of the gross - pitaevski equations.therefore it could be used to model quasi - one - dimensional bec @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ eq : vnls2 ] ) is not integrable .",
    "however a perturbed gctc was derived for several special types of potentials @xcite .",
    "next we consider mm with cross - modulation parameter @xmath12 @xmath13   u_1(x , t ) = 0 , \\\\",
    "i \\frac{\\partial u_2 } { \\partial t }   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\partial^2 u_2 } { \\partial x^2 } + \\left [ ( 1+\\alpha_2)|u_1|^2 + ( 1-\\alpha_2)|u_2|^2 \\right ]   u_2(x , t ) = 0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] obviously for small @xmath12 the above equation can be still considered as a perturbed nonlinear vector schrdinger equation .",
    "( [ eq : man1 ] ) , as other perturbed versions of mm is also non - integrable @xcite .",
    "nevertheless for small @xmath12 the adiabaticity is still possible and a respective generalized ctc model can be built .",
    "this is the main goal of the investigation in this paper . the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : man1 ] ) has been analyzed in detail previously by numerical methods in @xcite for wide range of @xmath12 .    in sections 2 and 3",
    "we introduce some preliminary facts and notations and apply the variational approach to the system ( [ eq : man1 ] ) to derive a perturbed gctc model that models the @xmath8-soliton trains in the presence of cross - modulation @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty here is to derive an adequate equation for the evolution of the polarization vectors @xmath14 . in section 4",
    "we briefly discuss how the gctc can be used to investigate the asymptotic regimes of the soliton trains . in section 5",
    "we demonstrate that for some sets of soliton parameters the perturbed gctc gives very good description for the cross - modulated mm . to this end",
    "we solve the cross - modulated mm numerically by using an implicit scheme of crank - nicolson type in complex arithmetic for the linear part of the operator and internal iterations for the nonlinear one .",
    "the concept of the internal iterations is applied ( see @xcite ) in order to ensure the implementation of the conservation laws on difference level within the round - off error of the calculations @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the relevant gctc have been obtained using maple . knowing the numeric solution @xmath5 of the perturbed mm we calculate he maxima of @xmath15 , compare them with the ( numeric solutions ) for @xmath16 of the gctc and plot the predicted by both models trajectories for each of the solitons .",
    "thus we are able to analyze the effects of the cross - modulation on the soliton interactions .",
    "we end with some conclusions and discussions .",
    "here we briefly remind the derivation of the ctc as a model describing the @xmath8-soliton interactions of multicomponent nls systems using the variational approach @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the adiabatic approximation to soliton interactions is as follows @xcite .",
    "consider the mm , or one of its perturbed versions and analyze the dynamics of its solution with initial condition : @xmath17 where @xmath18 the @xmath19-component polarization vector is parametrized by @xmath20 it is obviously normalized by the conditions @xmath21 .",
    "the adiabatic approximation holds true if the soliton parameters satisfy @xcite : @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the average amplitude and velocity , respectively .",
    "in fact we have two different scales : @xmath26    next the basic idea of the adiabatic approximation is to derive a dynamical system for the soliton parameters which would describe their interaction .",
    "the initial condition ( [ eq : nstr ] ) is not an exact @xmath8-soliton solution evaluated at @xmath27 .",
    "it involves some small ( @xmath28 ) contribution of radiation due to the continuous spectrum .",
    "adiabaticity also means that the solitons never overlap strongly .",
    "if this happens the approximation breaks down .",
    "initially this idea was proposed by karpman and solovev @xcite .",
    "they inserted the initial condition in the nls and after tedious calculations derived the dynamical system for the 8 parameters of the two solitons .",
    "a slightly different approach was proposed in @xcite . there",
    "the authors multiply the nls eq . by a set of orthogonal functions and integrate .",
    "such approach requires that the set orthogonal functions is convenient and complete .    an alternative derivation known as the variational approach was proposed by anderson and lisak @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "later this idea was generalized to @xmath8-soliton interactions @xcite and the corresponding dynamical system for the @xmath29-soliton parameters was identified as a @xmath8-site ctc .",
    "the fact that the ctc , ( just like its real counterpart  the toda chain ( rtc ) ) is completely integrable gives additional possibilities .",
    "a detailed comparative analysis between the solutions of the rtc and ctc @xcite shows that the ctc allows for a variety of asymptotic regimes , see section 4 below .",
    "more precisely , knowing the initial soliton parameters one can effectively predict the asymptotic regime of the soliton train .",
    "another possible use of the same fact is , that one can describe the sets of soliton parameters responsible for each of the asymptotic regimes .",
    "another important advantage of the adiabatic approach is , that one may consider the effects of various perturbations on the soliton interactions @xcite .",
    "these results were extended to treat the soliton interactions of the manakov solitons .",
    "we derive a generalized version of the ctc as a model describing the behavior of the @xmath8-soliton trains of the mm @xcite .",
    "this generalized ctc includes also the evolution of the polarization vectors @xmath14 . using it",
    "one can predict the asymptotic regimes of the manakov solitons and can describe the sets of soliton parameters that are responsible for each of the asymptotic regimes .",
    "of course , just like for the scalar case , one can also analyze the effects of the various perturbations on the soliton interactions .",
    "we start with the lagrangian of the cross - modulated mm systems : @xmath30 - h.\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian for the cross - modulated mm is @xmath31 it is easy to check that the lagrangian equations of motion @xmath32 coincide with the equations ( [ eq : man1 ] ) .",
    "the idea of the variational approach of @xcite is to insert the anzatz ( [ eq : nstr ] ) into the lagrangian , perform the integration over @xmath3 and retain only terms of the orders of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the first obvious observation is that only the nearest neighbors solitons will contribute such terms and @xmath35    the leading order terms are the ones in @xmath36 which correspond to the terms involving only the @xmath23-th soliton ( see @xcite ) : @xmath37 note that the terms that do not contain @xmath2-derivatives are of the order of 1 .",
    "the order of the terms that contain @xmath2-derivatives can be established after one derives the evolution equations .",
    "the second type of terms are the ones that involve only two different solitons , say @xmath23 and @xmath38 .",
    "for example , consider @xmath39 for @xmath40 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ikp ] ) is the largest and is of the order of @xmath41 : @xmath42 in estimating the integral in ( [ eq : ikp ] ) and ( [ eq : eps ] ) we also did several approximations : a ) we replaced @xmath43 and @xmath44 by @xmath45 thus neglecting terms of the order of @xmath46 ; b ) we replaced @xmath47 by @xmath48 thus neglecting terms of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ikp ] ) and ( [ eq : eps ] ) we find that @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the adiabatic approximation takes into account only the nearest neighbor interactions ( i.e. the ones with @xmath40 ) and neglects the ones with @xmath51 .",
    "the third types of terms contain the effect of interactions of three and more different solitons .",
    "it is easy to see that these integrals contribute terms of order @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively and therefore they are also neglected .    keeping only the terms up to the order of @xmath41 we obtain :",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the next step is to consider the effective lagrangian @xmath58 ( [ eq : l ] ) as a lagrangian of the dynamical system , describing the motion of the @xmath8-soliton train and providing the equations of motion for the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 for the manakov case ) soliton parameters .",
    "let us first consider the unperturbed case , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 .",
    "thus we arrive at the following set of dynamical equations for the soliton parameters : @xmath62 let us briefly discuss the order of the terms in the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:139.2 ] ) .",
    "since we have assumed that the average velocity of the soliton train is @xmath63 then from eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) it follows that the r.h.side of the first equation is @xmath64 .",
    "the r.h.side of the second equation in ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) for @xmath65 is of the order of 1 .",
    "however in the next equations in ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) there enter only the differences @xmath66 whose derivative , taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is again @xmath67 .",
    "the right hand sides of the other two equations in ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) are of the order of @xmath68 .",
    "in addition we need also the evolution equations for the polarization vectors @xmath14 which are : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a @xmath23-independent real constant .",
    "thus for the unperturbed case @xmath61 we have proven that @xmath71 . since the scalar products @xmath72 appear in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:139.2 ] ) in the factors @xmath73 , that are itself of the order @xmath74 it is evident that we can neglect the evolution of @xmath14 using the initial values of @xmath75 .",
    "the cross - modulation changes substantially the evolution of the polarization vectors @xmath14 . indeed , inserting into eq.([eq : lagr ] ) @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 and neglecting the terms of the order of @xmath74 we obtain the following evolution equations for @xmath14 : @xmath78 divide the first line in ( [ eq : nkt0 ] ) by @xmath79 and the second one by @xmath80 .",
    "the imaginary parts give immediately that @xmath81 if we use the parametrization : ( [ eq : nk0 ] ) then eq.([eq : nkt1 ] ) means that @xmath82 the real parts give immediately that @xmath83 let us now calculate the scalar product : @xmath84 now we can calculate the module and the phase of the scalar product : @xmath85 thus , from eqs.([eq:139.2 ] ) we get : @xmath86,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 besides , from ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) and ( [ eq : q_k ] ) there follows ( see @xcite ) : @xmath88 and @xmath89,\\ ] ] which proves the statement in @xcite .",
    "eq.([eq:141.3 ] ) , combined with the system of equations for the polarization vectors ( [ eq : nkt0 ] ) provides the proper generalization of the ctc for the cross - modulated mm .",
    "note , that for @xmath61 the scalar products @xmath90 are time - independent and as a result the gctc ( [ eq:141.3 ] ) is integrable .",
    "for @xmath91 however , the scalar products @xmath90 depend explicitly on @xmath2 as shown above , which makes the gctc non - integrable .",
    "the equations for the polarization vectors are nonlinear .",
    "so the whole system of equations for @xmath92 and @xmath14 seems to be rather complicated and non - integrable even for the unperturbed mm .",
    "however , all terms in the right hand sides of the evolution equations for @xmath14 are of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "this allows us to neglect the evolution of @xmath14 and to approximate them with their initial values . as a result",
    "we obtain that the @xmath8-soliton interactions for the multicomponent mm in the adiabatic approximation are modeled by the ctc , see section 3 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath8-soliton trains for the scalar nonlinear schrdinger equation are modeled by an integrable model ",
    "gctc allowed one to predict their asymptotic behavior . the method to do so",
    "was based on the exact integrability of the ctc @xcite and on its lax representation .    here",
    "we shall show , that similar results hold true also for the ctc ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) modeling the soliton trains of the mm .",
    "indeed , following moser  @xcite we introduce the lax pair @xmath94,\\ ] ] where @xmath95 here the matrices @xmath96 , and @xmath97 whenever one of the indices becomes 0 or @xmath98 ; the other notations in ( [ eq : k.3 ] ) are as follows : @xmath99 one can check that the compatibility condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : k.3 ] ) with @xmath100 and @xmath101 as in ( [ eq : lb ] ) is equivalent to the unperturbed gctc ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) .",
    "the first consequence of the lax representation is that the ctc has @xmath8 complex - valued integrals of motion provided by the eigenvalues of @xmath100 which we denote by @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "indeed the lax equation means that the evolution of @xmath100 is isospectral , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath104 .    another important consequence from the results of moser @xcite is that for the real toda chain one can write down explicitly its solutions in terms of the scattering data , which consist of pair series @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the first components of the properly normalized eigenvectors of @xmath107 @xcite . for the real toda chain",
    "both @xmath108 and @xmath106 are real ; besides all @xmath109 are different . next , moser calculated the asymptotics of these solutions for @xmath110 and showed that @xmath111 determine the asymptotic velocities of the particles .",
    "the formulae derived by moser can easily be extended to the complex case @xcite .",
    "the important difference is that all important ingredients such as eigenvalues @xmath109 and first components of the eigenvectors of @xmath100 normalized to 1 now become complex - valued .",
    "in addition , the important asset of @xmath100 for the rtc , namely that all eigenvalues are real and different , is also lost .",
    "however the asymptotics of the solutions for @xmath110 can be calculated with the result : @xmath112 where @xmath113 in ( [ eq : l.1 ] ) is some real positive constant , which is estimated by the minimal difference between the asymptotic velocities .",
    "equating the real parts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l.1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath114 which means that the real parts @xmath111 of the eigenvalues of @xmath100 determine the asymptotic velocities for the ctc .",
    "this fact can be used to classify the regimes of asymptotic behavior .",
    "let us also remind the important differences between rtc and ctc .",
    "the only possible asymptotic behavior in the rtc is the asymptotically free motion of the soliton . for ctc",
    "the variety is much more depending on the number of solitons in the trains we differ three asymptotic regimes : asymptotically free regime , bound state regime , and mixed asymptotic regimes ( for details see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the perturbed ctc taking into account the effects of the cross - modulation to the best of our knowledge is not integrable and does not allow lax representation .",
    "therefore we are applying numeric methods to solve it .",
    "in order to understand better the influence of the cross - modulation we will reduce our considerations to two - soliton trains . we start with the case of trivial cross - modulation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the equations become mm . in this case the trajectories of the soliton centers predicted by ctc and finite - difference implementation of mm are in excellent agreement .",
