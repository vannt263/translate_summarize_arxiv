    "cosmology , as the physics of the universe as a whole , places special limitations on scientific statements to be reasonably inferred from observations . on a general basis , this was discussed in @xcite who noted that some general properties seem to arise automatically during cosmological evolution . their verification for our universe then does not reveal anything about its possibly more complicated past . for instance , isotropization @xcite demonstrates that the observation of a nearly isotropic present universe does not present much useful information on an initial state at much earlier times .",
    "similarly , one may add decoherence to the list which can be seen as doing the same for the observation of a nearly classical present universe : most initial states would decohere and arrive at a semiclassical state ; thus its observation does not rule out stronger quantum behavior at earlier stages . given this , it is surprising to see recent discussions about a universe before the big bang in several approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "not just statements about the possibility of the universe having existed before the big bang are being made , which could in principle be inferred from a general analysis of equations of motion , but even assumptions on its classicality or claims about the form of its state such as its fluctuations at those times are put forward .",
    "even if this may be possible theoretically , it raises the question how much one can really learn about a pre - big bang universe from observations .",
    "a solvable model of quantum cosmology is used here to draw cosmological conclusions within this model about the possible nature of the big bang and a universe preceding it .",
    "the viewpoint followed has been spelled out in @xcite where also some of the results have already been reported .",
    "this model does show a bounce at small volume instead of the classical singularity present in solutions of general relativity .",
    "we therefore use it to shed light on the general questions posed above .",
    "the promotion of this specific model is not intended as a statement that its bounce would be generic for quantum gravity even within the same framework .",
    "in fact , the conclusion of the bounce in this and related models available so far is based on several specific properties which prevent a generic statement about this form of singularity removal . we rather take the following viewpoint : assume there is a theoretical description of a bouncing universe ; what implications can be derived for its pre - bounce state ?",
    "the specific model used is distinguished by a key fact which makes it suitable for addressing such a general question : as a solvable model , the system displays properties of its dynamical coherent states which , to some degree , are comparable to those of the harmonic oscillator . there is no back - reaction of quantum fluctuations or higher moments of a state on the time evolution of its expectation values .",
    "their trajectory is thus independent of the spreading of a state if it occurs , a property which is well known for the harmonic oscillator ( for instance , as a simple consequence of the ehrenfest theorem ) .",
    "this behavior is certainly special compared to other quantum systems , but the precise derivation of properties of dynamical coherent states it allows are nevertheless important .",
    "for instance , a large part of theoretical quantum optics is devoted to a computation of fluctuations in squeezed coherent states of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "similarly , the solvable model studied here allows detailed calculations of its dynamical coherent states which are of interest for quantum cosmology .",
    "in particular , the solvable model we will be using eliminates the classical big bang singularity by quantum effects .",
    "dynamical coherent states highlight the behavior of fluctuations of the state of the universe before and after the big bang .",
    "care is , however , needed for the physical interpretation of the results .",
    "while quantum optics allows one to prepare a desired state and perform measurements on it , quantum cosmology has to make use of the one universe state that is given to us . unlike quantum optics , where states can be prepared to be close to harmonic oscillator states",
    ", we can not realize states of the solvable quantum cosmological model .",
    "the real universe is certainly very different from anything solvable , and so the availability of a certain feature or numerical result in a solvable model is unlikely to be related to a realistic property of the universe .",
    "thus , as spelled out in @xcite , we focus on pessimism in our analysis of the solvable model : the _ in_ability of making certain predictions even in a fully controlled model is likely to be a reliable statement much more generally ; adding complications of a real universe would only make those predictions even more difficult .    for solvable systems of this kind",
    "it is easier by far to solve equations of motion for expectation values and fluctuations directly , rather than taking the detour of a specifically represented wave function .",
    "properties of coherent states are then determined by selecting solutions of fluctuations which saturate uncertainty relations .",
    "we will first illustrate this procedure for the harmonic oscillator with an emphasis on squeezed states .",
    "we present this brief review in section [ squeezed ] intended as an introduction of the methods then used in quantum cosmology .",
    "the main part of this paper is an application of those methods to the solvable system of quantum cosmology , as well as a physical discussion . instead of different cycles of a harmonic oscillator , in quantum cosmology we will be dealing with the pre- and post - big bang phase of a universe .",
    "just as fluctuations in a squeezed harmonic oscillator state can oscillate during the cycles , fluctuations in quantum cosmology may change from one phase to the next",
    ". our main concern will be the reliability of predictions about the precise state of the universe before the big bang , based on knowledge we can achieve after the big bang .",
    "from the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath0 we have equations of motion @xmath1\\rangle= \\frac{1}{m } \\langle\\hat{p}\\rangle \\quad,\\quad   \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d } t}\\langle\\hat{p}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[\\hat{p},\\hat{h}]\\rangle   = -m\\omega^2\\langle\\hat{q}\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for expectation values of a state .",
    "these are already in closed form and can thus be solved without knowing anything about fluctuations or other moments of the state .",
    "one obtains a trajectory in exact agreement with the classical one .    to find out more about the behavior of the state",
    "while its expectation values follow the classical trajectory , we can derive and solve equations of motion @xmath2\\rangle}{i\\hbar}- 2\\langle\\hat{q}\\rangle\\frac{{\\rm d}\\langle\\hat{q}\\rangle}{{\\rm d}t}=   \\frac{2}{m}c_{qp}\\label{deltaqdot}\\\\ \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t } c_{qp } & = & -m\\omega^2(\\delta q)^2+\\frac{1}{m}(\\delta p)^2 \\label{cqpdot}\\\\ \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t } ( \\delta p)^2&= & -m\\omega^2c_{qp } \\label{deltapdot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for fluctuations",
    ". also these equations form a closed set , and can thus be solved without requiring knowledge of higher moments which we write in the general form @xmath3 as expectation values of weyl ordered products of operators .",
    "it is clear that to second order fluctuations @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as the covariance @xmath6 result .",
    "we thus determine exact state properties in this way , and there is no need for an approximation .",
    "approximations would , however , be necessary for anharmonic systems where equations of all the moments and of expectation values are coupled with each other .",
    "systematic treatments @xcite give rise to effective equations for the motion of expectation values including quantum corrections from back - reaction of moments on the expectation values .    to select coherent states , we need to saturate the uncertainty relation @xmath7 among all coherent states , those with vanishing correlations , @xmath8 , have minimal uncertainties . for harmonic oscillator states , this requires @xmath9 for @xmath10 to remain zero at all times according to ( [ cqpdot ] ) . as the equations of motion ( [ deltaqdot ] ) and ( [ deltapdot ] ) then show , the uncertainties must be constant in time : the state does not spread at all while its expectation values follow the classical trajectory . if we require the uncertainty relation to be saturated , fluctuations are determined uniquely for uncorrelated states . the corresponding state is the harmonic oscillator ground state , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "but for non - zero correlations there are differently squeezed states whose relation between @xmath13 and @xmath14 does not agree with that realized for the ground state , even if saturation of the uncertainty relation is required .",
    "more generally squeezed states exist if we remain on the saturation surface but allow non - zero covariance . with @xmath15 , fluctuations now depend on time in an oscillatory manner .",
    "these properties can all be derived without using a specific representation of states . for comparison",
    ", one may easily check that states saturating the uncertainty relation are gaussians @xmath16 in the position representation , with @xmath17 for normalizability .",
    "if @xmath18 is real , we have uncorrelated states at the absolute minimum of the saturation surface .",
    "otherwise , the covariance is given by @xmath19 .",
    "isotropic cosmology is based on one pair of canonical variables : the scale factor @xmath20 which determines the spatial size of a universe and its momentum , related to @xmath21 with proper time @xmath22 .",
    "dynamics is determined by the friedmann equation @xmath23 where the energy density @xmath24 of matter provides the source and @xmath25 is newton s constant .",
    "we will be especially interested in a matter source given by a free , massless scalar @xmath26 with momentum @xmath27 .",
    "its energy density is independent of @xmath26 and takes the purely kinetic form @xmath28 as we will see , this system provides a solvable model playing the role of the harmonic oscillator for quantum cosmology .",
    "since our aim is to study properties of dynamical coherent states especially in their relation between pre- and post - big bang phases , we use a quantization which eliminates the classical singularity occurring when solutions reach @xmath29 . in isotropic models , this can generally be achieved in loop quantum cosmology @xcite , where geometry is quantized and the spectrum of geometrical operators becomes discrete .",
    "the form of the discreteness , i.e.  whether it is the scale factor itself whose spectrum is equidistantly spaced or rather some of its powers such as the volume @xmath30 , is to be determined from the precise form of dynamics in quantum gravity .",
    "fortunately , our model will not be sensitive to this detail , and we can thus leave the precise form of discreteness open .",
    "we introduce new canonical variables @xmath31 where the quantization of @xmath32 will have an equidistant spectrum .",
    "as @xmath33 is changed between different models , the form of the spectrum for geometrical quantities takes on all possibilities . from loop quantum gravity",
    "one expects @xmath33 to lie within the range @xmath34 @xcite , with phenomenological arguments favoring a value near @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a further implication of the discreteness of @xmath36 in a quantization is that no operator for @xmath37 itself can exist .",
    "this is similar to quantization on a circle , where the angle as a local coordinate can not be promoted to an operator but only its periodic functions which are global functions on the configuration space .",
    "similarly , there is no operator for @xmath37 or @xmath38 in loop quantum cosmology , but only quantizations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for real @xmath41 .",
    "notice that the periodicity is kept free since operators for all @xmath41 exist .",
    "this happens because the space of values @xmath38 is not simply modified to a circle by postulating a periodic identification .",
    "the quantum configuration space @xcite is rather a compactification of the real line , the so - called bohr compactification , which contains the whole real line as a dense set but is itself compact .",
    "accordingly , an orthonormal basis can be written as @xmath42 for this non - separable hilbert space .",
    "the basic operators act as @xmath43 with commutator @xmath44 = \\hbar\\widehat{\\exp(i\\delta p)}\\ ] ] as appropriate for a canonical pair @xmath45 .",
    "thus , also the quantized friedmann equation must make use of @xmath46 rather than @xmath38 directly . at this point , @xmath41 would be fixed such that dynamics can be restricted to a separable sector of the full hilbert space .",
    "qualitative properties discussed here do not depend on the value of @xmath41 , nor on that of @xmath33 used in the definition of classical variables .",
    "the construction of loop quantum cosmology shows that the term @xmath47 , which as per equation ( [ friedmann ] ) is proportional to @xmath48 for a free scalar , then takes the form @xmath49 .",
    "independently of @xmath33 , it reduces to the classical expression in the small - curvature limit @xmath50 .",
    "( we do not write this as a proper operator yet because we will later be led to a specific factor ordering which is being kept free for now . ) disregarding numerical factors , the dynamical equation combining ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) can thus be written in the form @xmath51 if the matter value @xmath26 is interpreted as a time variable , this shows that the hamiltonian in this internal time description is @xmath52 . for small @xmath37 and disregarding the absolute value , this would be a quadratic hamiltonian and we would have the same decoupling behavior as in the harmonic oscillator .",
    "( this berry  keating  connes hamiltonian @xcite plays a role in the context of the riemann hypothesis .",
    ") however , the sine certainly makes the expression non - quadratic in canonical variables .    remarkably , the system is still solvable even with the sine .",
    "we have to change variables to non - canonical ones and specify a precise factor ordering of the hamiltonian .",
    "let us introduce the operator @xmath53 which has a well - defined representation in loop quantum cosmology thanks to its periodicity in @xmath37 . together with @xmath36",
    ", we have the linear algebra @xmath54=\\hbar\\hat{j}\\quad,\\quad { }    [ \\hat{v},\\hat{j}^{\\dagger}]=-\\hbar\\hat{j}^{\\dagger}\\quad,\\quad { }    [ \\hat{j},\\hat{j}^{\\dagger}]=-2\\hbar\\hat{v}-\\hbar^2\\ ] ] equivalent to an @xmath55 algebra with a trivial central extension by @xmath56 .",
    "these operators quantize a complete set of phase space functions and can thus be used as basic operators for the construction of a quantum theory .",
    "they are also suitably chosen for the dynamics since the combination @xmath57 is a quantization of the classical hamiltonian ( [ pphi ] ) in a specific factor ordering .",
    "( note the absence of the absolute value compared to ( [ pphi ] ) . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this does not matter for states which satisfy @xmath58 as it would be part of the conditions for semiclassical states . )",
    "most importantly , the hamiltonian is a linear combination of two of our basic operators , which makes the system solvable and decouples fluctuations from expectation values : in equations of motion as in ( [ hoeom ] ) , @xmath59 $ ] is linear in basic operators for any basic operator @xmath60 .    with complex basic variables we have to impose a reality condition making sure that @xmath61 .",
    "taking an expectation value of this relation , @xmath62 shows that fluctuations and expectation values are related in a specific way .",
    "but this does not involve a coupling of all infinitely many moments .",
    "moreover , one can impose ( [ reality ] ) after having solved the equations of motion .",
    "thus , no severe complication to solvable systems in real variables arises .",
    "we can thus efficiently make use of the same solution procedure introduced above for the harmonic oscillator , and determine properties of dynamical coherent states .",
    "equations of motion for expectation values , fluctuations and covariances are @xmath63\\rangle=   -\\frac{1}{2}(\\langle\\hat{j}\\rangle+\\langle\\hat{j}^{\\dagger}\\rangle )   \\quad,\\quad \\frac{{{\\mathrm{d}}}}{{{\\mathrm{d}}}t}\\langle\\hat{j}\\rangle=   \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[\\hat{j},\\hat{h}]\\rangle=   -\\langle\\hat{v}\\rangle-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar=\\frac{{{\\mathrm{d}}}}{{{\\mathrm{d}}}t}\\langle\\hat{j}^{\\dagger}\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] and @xmath64    all equations can easily be solved : for expectation values we obtain , taking into account the reality condition ( [ reality ] ) , @xmath65 where @xmath66 . for these solutions , the reality condition implies @xmath67 with @xmath68 which according to ( [ gvvdot ] ) and ( [ gjbarjdot ] ) is constant in time . for states which are semiclassical at large volume ( or just at one time ) we must have @xmath69 and thus positive @xmath70 .",
    "this clearly shows the absence of the classical singularity since @xmath71 with @xmath72 never reaches zero . from now on we set @xmath73 without loss of generality since it simply amounts to a shift in the origin of our internal time @xmath26 .    for fluctuations and covariances we have explicit solutions @xmath74 with constants of integration @xmath75 ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "depending on the integration constants @xmath76 , there are obviously different possibilities in the relation of fluctuations before and after the big bang , defined as the minimum of @xmath77 .",
    "for special choices one can arrange the fluctuations to be identical at positive and negative @xmath26 , but not generically .",
    "the quantum state and its coherence will thus appear differently before and after the big bang , depending on what property of the state an observation might be sensitive to .",
    "this behavior of fluctuations is a direct consequence of the replacement of the classical singularity by a bounce , as it occurred due to the discreteness of geometry . without taking into account the discreteness ,",
    "we would have arrived at the berry  keating  connes hamiltonian quantizing @xmath78 directly .",
    "this system differs from the harmonic oscillator ( although it can be mapped by a canonical transformation to an upside - down harmonic oscillator ) in the fact that it does not have constant or even bounded fluctuations in its coherent states . however , the ratio @xmath79 is exactly preserved and ensures that an initial semiclassical state remains semiclassical .",
    "this behavior is also true for the loop quantized model for small curvature @xmath37 .",
    "but near the bounce there are strong deviations which result in a non - constant ratio @xmath79 .",
    "one can see this directly from the equations of motion ( [ vjdot ] ) and ( [ gvvdot ] ) , from which we derive @xmath80 this is zero for @xmath81 or , using the definition of @xmath82 , @xmath83 . for small @xmath37",
    "we can ignore the cosine and indeed derive that @xmath84 is constant .",
    "but near the bounce deviations of @xmath85 from its low - curvature value are important and , in general , imply non - constant relative fluctuations through the bounce .",
    "another possibility to satisfy the required relation is to have uncorrelated states such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 which would also imply a constant @xmath79 even through the bounce at high curvature . for squeezed states with correlations , however",
    ", relative fluctuations before and after the bounce can differ from each other , even though they are nearly constant in any pre- or post - bounce phase .    to make this precise",
    ", we can determine explicit forms of the uncertainty relations in our variables .",
    "for any pair @xmath88 of self - adjoint operators we have @xmath89\\rangle^2\\ ] ] so that in our case we can write three different inequalities : @xmath90 for the pair @xmath91 , @xmath92 for the pair @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the pair @xmath95 . inserting solutions , this provides the relations @xmath96 between the integration constants .",
    "the last two relations suppress the pre - bounce parameters of fluctuations by exponentials of @xmath26 and thus by the total volume .",
    "this is huge at late times and fluctuation parameters from before the big bang can thus be ignored completely after the big bang .",
    "in other words , these two relations do not provide any constraints on the state before the big bang .",
    "the first relation is different since any @xmath26-dependence dropped out .",
    "it thus presents an uncertainty relation between the pre- and post - big bang fluctuation parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the covariance term @xmath99 in this relation can be seen to represent matter fluctuations : from the reality condition together with @xmath100 we have @xmath101    in ( [ uncerti ] ) , however , @xmath26-dependent terms dropped out due to cancellations between the fluctuation and covariance terms in @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "if the model is changed slightly or one tries to use real observations which must be imprecise , those terms re - enter the game and lead to a dominant expression which involves only post - big bang fluctuations . but even with those cancellations there is no strong relation between pre- and post - big bang quantities , as shown now .    that squeezing is responsible for the possible asymmetry of fluctuations around the bounce can be seen by directly computing the quantum variables in our basic set of operators for a gaussian state . if this gaussian is not completely squeezed , corresponding to a real @xmath18 , then fluctuations before and after the bounce must be identical . a quick way to see",
    "this is to note that there are three independent parameters in an unsqueezed gaussian , @xmath104 and @xmath105 which determine the peak position in phase space and @xmath106 , and two constants of motion for expectation values and fluctuations , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . comparing two gaussian states , one before and one after the big bang along a dynamical trajectory , at equal volume fixes the free parameter .",
    "thus , the spreads must also be equal at a given volume .",
    "switching on general squeezing , however , introduces additional parameters and the conclusions are weaker .",
    "precise conditions can be found by solving the saturation equations explicitly .",
    "we use ( [ uncerti ] ) directly , and obtain three more equations from the @xmath109 and constant coefficients of ( [ uncertii ] ) and ( [ uncertiii ] ) : @xmath110 with ( [ c1minusc2 ] ) and ( [ c1plusc2 ] ) we can eliminate @xmath75 and @xmath111 in favor of @xmath112 and @xmath113 together with @xmath114 . as a first result , subtraction of ( [ satii ] ) and ( [ satiii ] ) shows that @xmath32-fluctuations can only be symmetric around the bounce , i.e.@xmath115 , if @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we have to look closer to see what range of deviations between @xmath97 and @xmath98 is allowed for coherent states",
    ".    we can directly solve ( [ satii ] ) and ( [ satiii ] ) for @xmath97 and @xmath98 in terms of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and then insert these variables in ( [ sati ] ) . in combination with ( [ sativ ] ) to eliminate the resulting term @xmath119 , we then have @xmath120 adding and subtracting @xmath121 from ( [ sativ ] ) , we obtain @xmath122 which finally provides @xmath123 as an explicit relation for the difference in pre- and post - big bang fluctuations of @xmath32 .    this expression can easily be estimated for its order of magnitude , noting that the uncertainty relations , especially ( [ uncertii ] ) , indicate that @xmath124 and , together with the reality condition , @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the first term in the square root is smallest while the remaining terms are of the order @xmath126 . the square root @xmath41 and thus @xmath127 is thus of the same order @xmath128 as the fluctuation @xmath129 .",
    "the asymmetry vanishes for @xmath130 which confirms results of @xcite and is consistent with the orders of magnitude given above .",
    "one can write the asymmetry more directly in fluctuation variables , providing a relation @xmath131 which resembles estimates provided independently by @xcite . for any value for @xmath112 , @xmath114 and @xmath113",
    "this number is of the small order @xmath132 , and thus one could conclude that the asymmetry must be small and all coherent states are very nearly symmetric .",
    "however , this is not true : the order @xmath132 is what one already expects for a single relative fluctuation @xmath133 since @xmath134 , not just for the difference in the asymmetry .",
    "fluctuations themselves are certainly small in a saturated state , and ( [ asymm ] ) only gives their magnitude but does not provide information on the asymmetry of those small quantities .",
    "this can easily be corrected because we have full control on our dynamical coherent state parameters . solving for @xmath98 from ( [ satiii ] ) and determining @xmath135 from ( [ delta ] ) , we derive @xmath136 which is a measure for the asymmetry independent of the total size of fluctuations .",
    "the sign in the denominator depends on whether @xmath137 ( upper sign ) or @xmath138 ( lower sign ) . as one can see , this vanishes for @xmath139 , i.e.  when ( [ deltahsymm ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "this is , however , only one special case and in general with @xmath140 one can only infer that @xmath141 is of the order @xmath142 , not necessarily close to zero .",
    "generically , the asymmetry for coherent states is not restricted at all .",
    "symmetry of fluctuations before and after the bounce is not generic even for states saturating the uncertainty relations .",
    "one simple example which illustrates how large the asymmetry can be is obtained for @xmath143 , in which case the first three terms in the denominator of ( [ relasymm ] ) cancel each other for the lower sign solution . for the constants",
    ", this implies that @xmath144 and thus @xmath145 and @xmath146 as well as @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "the only property which makes this case special is that @xmath149 , but the other magnitudes for fluctuations are fully acceptable . with this @xmath41 ,",
    "the relative asymmetry becomes @xmath151 , which is certainly a large value .",
    "in fact , although the denominator in ( [ relasymm ] ) never becomes zero for real @xmath41 , the expression is unbounded from above for the lower sign ( and reaches arbitrarily closely to @xmath152 for the upper sign ) .",
    "extremely large values require large fluctuations and thus , on the saturation surface , very high squeezing . but",
    "large values for @xmath153 can easily be reaches under appropriate conditions on semiclassical states . at constant @xmath112 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath141 along varying @xmath129 is realized for @xmath154 which results in a value @xmath155 this is indeed unbounded for the lower sign , but would require values of @xmath112 significantly larger than @xmath114 .",
    "since previous relations told us that @xmath156 for semiclassical behavior , @xmath112 should not differ too much from @xmath114 and we can approximate the semiclassical maximum of the asymmetry by the value @xmath157 . for the lower sign , this gives a value @xmath158 ( or @xmath159 for the upper sign ) near the example found above .",
    "one might think that a state with symmetric fluctuations makes the product @xmath160 minimal , just as a non - squeezed state does for the usual uncertainty product in quantum mechanics according to ( [ standarduncert ] ) .",
    "interestingly , this is not necessarily the case : ( [ sati ] ) shows that this product , for a given @xmath114 , is minimal for @xmath161 , and thus @xmath162 .",
    "this is not the value ( [ deltahsymm ] ) obtained above for symmetric fluctuations , unless we specialze the parameters further to @xmath163 .",
    "more generally , we rather have @xmath164 and thus @xmath165 which can take values of a magnitude similar to those obtained above .",
    "it vanishes for @xmath166 , which corresponds to symmetric fluctuations , but increases very rapidly for slightly larger values and can become arbitrarily large ( or very nearly one for the upper sign ) . for very large values one needs a large difference @xmath167 , but even @xmath168 , which is not an extreme value compared to @xmath169 of the symmetric case , gives @xmath170 . as illustrated in fig .",

    "curves are shown for @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 with larger @xmath114 corresponding to steeper curves .",
    "[ asymmfluct],width=415 ]",
    "uncertainty relations do provide a limit on the asymmetry provided that the size of fluctuations is known since the covariance and thus squeezing is limited for given fluctuations .",
    "one may thus hope to find a reliable bound on present fluctuations , by which one could restrict the squeezing of the state of the universe and thus also the pre - big bang fluctuations , which would be remarkable . but how can we find a strong upper bound on current fluctuations in the state of the universe ?",
    "density fluctuations are tiny , and were even smaller at the time of decoupling as we can see them through the cosmic microwave background .",
    "these are classical fluctuations in a very nearly classical phase , and quantum fluctuations must be even smaller .",
    "this can not give a good estimate for our purposes , however , because these are fluctuations of inhomogeneities .",
    "they were already assumed to vanish in the isotropic model used . by putting an observational bound on something already assumed to vanish one can certainly not derive anything new .",
    "fluctuations we are dealing with are quantum fluctuations even of the isotropic variables of a universe .",
    "moreover , if we wanted to use real observations to restrict the state of the universe before the big bang we would have to consider decoherence .",
    "decoherence is certainly acting in the real universe and is usually understood as making quantum states more classical by interactions with a large environment of weakly interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "the huge number of degrees of freedom it requires are also ignored in the model ; to compare observations with results in the model we would thus have to factor out decoherence processes .",
    "these considerations bring us back to the introductory remarks : we can use a solvable model as the most optimistic option . here",
    ", one can explicitly compute the general behavior of states and how some properties ( e.g.  before the big bang ) affect others ( e.g.  those after the big bang ) . making this model more realistic",
    "can only complicate the derivation of any such properties , for which decoherence would be an example .",
    "even if we take the model for real , there are limitations on knowledge of the precise form of the pre - big bang state , such as its fluctuations .",
    "the model clearly tells us that , using observations only after the big bang , we would have to determine the precise squeezing of the state to extrapolate all the way to the state before the big bang .",
    "doing this would require so much control that , even disregarding decoherence , it should be considered hopeless , the existence of upper bounds on squeezing for given fluctuations notwithstanding .",
    "what could one infer about the pre - big bang state in a hypothetical harmonic universe which follows the solutions provided here and does not show decoherence ? in principle",
    "this should give one access to properties of the wave function .",
    "quantum variables such as @xmath179 contain the pre - bounce quantities only with tiny suppression factors @xmath180 and thus do not provide insights .",
    "one would have to measure current fluctuations very precisely to infer the state parameters .",
    "assuming that the state is coherent , ( [ relasymm ] ) tells us what has to be measured to determine @xmath41 .",
    "( if the state can not be assumed coherent , changes between the pre- and post - bounce phase would be much more pronounced . )",
    "we thus need to find the three parameters @xmath112 , @xmath114 and @xmath113 from observations .",
    "this is subtle because the asymmetry depends on @xmath112 and @xmath114 only by the ratio @xmath181 , which for purposes here can be assumed to be just unity , and @xmath182 .",
    "the latter is important for the precise magnitude of @xmath41 , but arises as a small value from a near cancellation between two large quantities .",
    "[ asymmfluct ] clearly illustrates how sensitive the asymmetry is to small changes in the parameters especially for the realistic case of large @xmath114 . to see the origin of this quantity",
    "it is important to consider a solvable model with precise access to dynamical coherent states .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath114 quantifies the matter content and can possibly be measured well .",
    "similar , matter fluctuations @xmath113 can be granted to be under good observational control .",
    "difficulties arise for the parameter @xmath112 .",
    "it determines the size @xmath32 of the universe at the bounce , but this can hardly be used for an observational determination .",
    "alternatively , one could use the present @xmath32 and eliminate the factor @xmath183 , the ratio of the present size the bounce size , through the age of the universe .",
    "the internal time @xmath26 is not proper time @xmath22 , but they can be related through @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "both potentially observable quantities , @xmath32 and @xmath185 , are huge and provide @xmath112 in their ratio .",
    "relative uncertainties in each measurement will provide large absolute uncertainties for @xmath112 , and yet we need to produce a subtle cancellation with @xmath114 to find the precise @xmath41 .",
    "this prevents a sufficient observational control on the state in order to determine its pre - bounce fluctuations , even though the evolution is deterministic .",
    "we have presented details only for the moments of order two , but all orders behave similarly .",
    "there are thus infinitely many variables lacking for a precise knowledge of the pre - bounce state , nut just the fluctuation .",
    "thus , the way the classical singularity is removed in loop quantum cosmology may present a well - defined universe scenario without divergences of energy density , but it does not allow us to know precisely what happened before the big bang : the past is shrouded by cosmic forgetfulness @xcite .",
