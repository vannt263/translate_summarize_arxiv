    "the recent discovery of a new boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite will lead to a detailed study of its properties in the next years , and will require a careful comparison of the experimental data with the results of precise calculations for the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) . vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , @xmath0 , is the second largest channel for detecting the higgs boson .",
    "it is a pure electroweak process and its study is very important for determining the couplings and for a deeper knowledge of the higgs sector@xcite .",
    "however , at the 10 tev energy scale of lhc , even the electroweak radiative corrections become important  @xcite and should be included in computer simulations together with qcd corrections  @xcite . with a partonic center - of - mass energy @xmath1 of several tev - more than an order of magnitude larger than the masses @xmath2 of the gauge bosons -",
    "the radiative corrections contain large sudakov logarithmic terms @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the weak coupling constants and the logarithms @xmath5 emerge from the two different energy scales .",
    "these terms dominate the perturbative expansion and may even require resummation when the fixed order perturbation expansion breaks down",
    ". however , for vbf the scattering amplitude is proportional to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and standard resummation methods do not apply because the effective operator is not a gauge singlet .",
    "that makes vbf a special interesting process to deal with .",
    "the sudakov logarithms can be regarded as infrared logarithms since they diverge as @xmath6 , and by using an effective theory they can be converted to ultraviolet logarithms and summed by standard renormalization group techniques .",
    "quite recently the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite has been shown to provide a simple way to obtain the sum of the series of leading - logs ( ll ) @xmath7 , next - to - leading - logs ( nll ) @xmath8 , next - to - next - to - leading - logs ( nnll ) @xmath9 , etc .",
    "@xcite . in the effective theory the single terms contributing to the scattering amplitude",
    "are multiplied by the general factor  @xcite @xmath10 { \\nonumber}\\\\   & \\quad \\times   \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_{\\mu_l}^{\\mu_h } \\frac { { \\rm d}\\mu}{\\mu } \\left [ a(\\alpha(\\mu))\\log\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\mu^2_h}+b ( \\alpha(\\mu ) )   \\right ]   \\right\\ }    { \\nonumber}\\\\    & \\quad \\times   \\exp f ( \\alpha(\\mu_h))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the low energy scale and @xmath12 is the high energy scale .",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 is the high scale matching coefficient , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the low scale matching coefficients , @xmath16 is the non - cusp anomalous dimension and @xmath17 is the coefficient of the cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "the ll series is summed by the one - loop cusp anomalous dimension ; the sum of the nll series requires the two - loop cusp anomalous dimension , the one - loop non - cusp anomalous dimension , and the one - loop low scale matching coefficient @xmath15 ; the nnll series is given by the the three - loop cusp , two - loop @xmath16 and @xmath15 , one - loop @xmath14 and @xmath13 , etc .",
    "in fact the exponentiated form of eq.([amp ] ) only requires the inclusion of electroweak corrections at low orders , while the unexponentiated form of fixed - order calculations would require electroweak corrections of any order for achieving the same accuracy . in some recent papers  @xcite the method as been used for calculating the electroweak corrections to higgs production via vbf .",
    "numerical results at nll order were obtained for the cross section , including the effect of parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite .",
    "most of the corrections were obtained in analytical form by scet and might be easily included in the other software packages that have been developed , without the need of tedious loop calculations .",
    "while pdfs imply a 3% error , many of the retained terms at nll order are very small , less than 1% , and could be neglected in order to speed up the numerical integration of the cross section . in this paper",
    "the simpler ll order resummation is compared with the full nll calculation for higgs production via vbf , and the accuracy of the two approximations is discussed .",
    "the ll calculation of the cross section is found to deviate from the nll result by less than @xmath18 up to 10 tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "while the present study gives a useful evaluation of the accuracy in the scet resummation , it provides a very simple and fast analytical way for including the electroweak radiative corrections in software packages .",
    "in fact at nll order the one - loop anomalous dimension turns out to be a @xmath19 matrix in the operator basis  @xcite , and the running integral in eq.([amp ] ) requires a numerical computation .",
    "moreover two - loop beta functions are required for the running of the couplings at the same order , yielding coupled equations that again must be solved by a numerical routine . on the other hand , at ll order the only one - loop term that is required is the cusp anomalous dimension , and by use of the simple uncoupled one - loop beta functions the running integral in eq.([amp ] ) is analytical , yielding a diagonal correction factor for the differential cross section . moreover",
    ", an exact cancellation of terms yields the same correction factor that would be found for the quark scattering @xmath20 , plus higgs rescattering and wave function renormalization terms .",
    "nll terms are still shown to be relevant for a full description of the dependence on scattering angles of the differential cross section , but such small dependence is averaged in the integrated cross section .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
