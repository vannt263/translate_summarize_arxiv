    "<S> we explain the findings by di leonardo _ et al . _ [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . lett . * 84 * , 6054 ( 2000 ) ] that the effective temperature of a lennard - jones glass depends only on the final value of the density in the volume and/or temperature jump that produces the glass phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is not only a property of the lennard - jones liquid , but a feature of all strongly correlating liquids . for such liquids data from a single quench simulation </S>",
    "<S> provides enough information to predict the effective temperature of any glass produced by jumping from an equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is validated by simulations of the kob - andersen binary lennard - jones liquid and shown not to apply for the non - strongly correlating monatomic lennard - jones gaussian liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> condensed matter is frequently found in out - of - equilibrium states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for systems like supercooled liquids , dense colloids , spin systems , etc . , the ( off - equilibrium ) glass state occurs naturally after cooling or compression from a state of thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> an _ effective temperature _ describes the non - equilibrium properties of a glass , and the possibility of connecting the effective temperature with the observed violation of the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( fdt ) has opened new ways of inquiry @xcite . in 2000 di leonardo _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied the off - equilibrium dynamics of the single - component lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid ( with a small many - body term added to the potential to prevent crystallization ) . </S>",
    "<S> this system was subjected to sudden temperature decreases at constant density ( _ quenches _ ) as well as to sudden density increases at constant temperature ( _ crunches _ ) . from the violation of the fdt </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature was determined . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , it was observed that the effective temperature @xmath0 is independent of the particular path in the temperature - density plane crossing the glass transition line : @xmath0 depends only on the final density . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the findings of di leonardo _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ hold only for _ strongly correlating liquids _ </S>",
    "<S> ( defined below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue and demonstrate that - for this class of liquids - from a single quench simulation one can predict the effective temperatures for any off - equilibrium jump .    </S>",
    "<S> reference documented the existence of a large class of liquids characterized by strong correlations between virial ( @xmath1 ) and potential energy ( @xmath2 ) thermal equilibrium fluctuations at fixed volume , @xmath3 . strongly correlating liquids </S>",
    "<S> have a hidden ( approximate ) scale invariance , which implies that they inherit many - but not all - of the scaling properties of liquids interacting via inverse power - law potentials . </S>",
    "<S> strongly correlating liquids include van der waals liquids like lennard - jones type liquids but not , e.g. , hydrogen - bonding liquids . </S>",
    "<S> strongly correlating liquids have curves in their phase diagrams </S>",
    "<S>  `` isomorphs ''  along which several static and dynamic properties are invariant @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> if the density is denoted by @xmath4 and the temperature by @xmath5 , an isomorph is given by @xmath6 the exponent @xmath7 - which may be slightly state - point dependent - can be calculated from a quench simulation utilizing the relation between the relaxing averages , @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> because the canonical probabilities of scaled configurations belonging to the same isomorph are identical , a jump between two isomorphic state points takes the system instantaneously to equilibrium ( property ( _ i_))@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , jumps from isomorphic state points to the same final state point show identical aging behavior ( property ( _ ii _ ) ) @xcite . in view of these properties </S>",
    "<S> the results of di leonardo _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite may be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> a crunch from density @xmath9 to density @xmath10 can be ideally decomposed into two parts ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f0 ] ) : first the system jumps _ instantaneously _ from its initial state to the corresponding isomorphic state at the final density ( i.e. , the state which has the same @xmath11 as the initial state ) , see the blue curve of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f0 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is an equilibrium state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter the system begins to thermalize to the final temperature at constant density . </S>",
    "<S> if the crunch is made to a state with very high density , the thermalization takes extremely long or maybe infinite time , and the effective temperature may be determined from the fdt violation as detailed below . in this way </S>",
    "<S> any crunch corresponds to a quench to the final density with the same relaxation pattern . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , these two transformations should have identical fdt violation factors and identical effective temperatures .     </S>",
    "<S> ( filled circle ) is identical for these transformations . in all processes represented here </S>",
    "<S> the liquid undergoes a glass transition characterized by an effective temperature that can be measured from the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 versus ( final ) density constitutes an isomorph , as discussed later in the text.,width=321 ]    these ideas should apply to any strongly correlating liquid , not just the single - component lj system . to confirm this we simulated the standard kob - andersen binary lennard - jones ( kablj ) system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following di leonardo _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite we subjected the kablj liquid to a number of instantaneous quenches and crunches and calculated the effective temperatures from the _ fluctuation - dissipation relation _ ( fdr ) . </S>",
    "<S> recall that for off - equilibrium systems the fdr in @xmath13 units is @xcite    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the equilibrium correlation function of the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the unperturbed situation , the perturbing contribution to the hamiltonian is @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the response of @xmath16 to an infinitesimal external field of magnitude @xmath20 applied at time @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the _ fdt violation factor_. this is unity at short times @xmath23 while @xmath24 in the long - time limit @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> the correlation function studied is the self - intermediate scattering function , and @xmath30 is dimensionless .    for quenches to low enough temperatures , at long times an effective temperature of the slow degrees of freedom @xmath12 is associated with the fdt violation factor : @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature reflects the slow structural rearrangements in the sense that the aging system behaves as if it were thermalized at @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained @xmath22 by calculating the correlation function and the response function in the non - equilibrium regime by means of @xmath32/\\partial c(t , t')|_t$ ] , which applies at long times ( note that the correct @xmath22 is found by taking this derivative at fixed @xmath33 , not at fixed @xmath34 @xcite ) .     </S>",
    "<S> ( monte carlo steps ) and @xmath34 varying from @xmath35 to @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> all functions plotted here have the same reduced k - vector @xcite ( referring to the final density ) ( @xmath37 ) and the same reduced microscopic time @xcite . in the crunch ( @xmath37 ) we set @xmath38 corresponding to the reduced k - vector @xmath39 ( see @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crunch ( @xmath37 ) overlaps very well with the quench ( @xmath40 ) that takes the system from an initial state isomorphic to the one of the crunch to the same final state . </S>",
    "<S> note also the good superposition of the additional quench ( @xmath41 ) that takes the system from a state isomorphic to the initial state of ( @xmath37 ) to a state isomorphic to the final one of ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : teffscal ] ) for @xmath12 , adjusted only by a vertical shift to fit the data.,width=330 ]    recently berthier introduced a new method for calculating the response without applying any external field to an off - equilibrium monte - carlo simulation of the kablj @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use his procedure and study the same dynamic variables for building the correlation function and the response as in ref . . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , the crunch overlaps well with the quench since - as argued above - they follow the same aging pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath7 was estimated by a linear fit of the parameter plot @xmath42 vs @xmath43 when the system is relaxing after a temperature jump from @xmath44 to @xmath45 at fixed @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> the fdt violation factor @xmath22 should be identical . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of this @xmath42 vs. @xmath48 plot is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical equations used for drawing the isomorphs in the @xmath49-@xmath2 plot here are reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite.,width=330 ]    identical responses and correlations do not only appear when a strongly correlating liquid is taken from two isomorphic state to the same state point . </S>",
    "<S> supplementing properties ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) , strongly correlating liquids have a third interesting aging property ( _ iii _ ) : for two jumps @xmath50 and @xmath51 between mutually isomorphic initial and final states ( i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) the systems follow the same path in configuration space in reduced units ( see @xcite ) , and the dynamical equations governing the evolution of the particle trajectories are identical when cast in reduced units . accordingly , the responses and correlations of two such jumps must be identical in reduced units . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f2 ] we show the reduced - unit @xmath54 and @xmath55 of a quench between initial and final states that are isomorphic , respectively , to the initial and final states of the crunch described above ( red triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between the functions is good . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is visualized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f1 ] , which shows the variables @xmath42 vs @xmath48 in two jumps ( with the same initial and final @xmath11 ) connected by an isomorph at each time @xmath33 during the relaxation .    </S>",
    "<S> a further consequence of property ( _ iii _ ) is the following . because the reduced - unit evolution of the dynamical properties is the same for the system in the two jumps , their fdr violation factors must also be identical , @xmath56 . combining this equation with @xmath53 and expressing @xmath22 via the effective temperature , we find @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that    @xmath58    this equation identifies the dynamic glass transition curve in the ( @xmath59 ) plane defined in terms of the fdr effective temperature with an isomorph . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the findings of ref . and the standard way of defining the glass transition , because the standard glass line in the ( @xmath59 ) plane is located where the equilibrium relaxation time reaches a certain ( high ) value of order the inverse cooling rate . for strongly correlating liquids </S>",
    "<S> an isomorph is also an `` isochronal '' curve along which the ( reduced ) relaxation time is constant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : f2 ] shows the slopes predicted by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : teffscal ] ) ( lines ) ; clearly the prediction is fulfilled .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) that the effective temperature is independent of the initial and final temperature if the initial temperature is high ( the system is in a warm liquid state ) and if the quenching temperature is low enough ( i.e. , in the linear regime where @xmath60 with constant @xmath0 ) . equation ( [ eq : teffscal ] ) predicts the effective temperatures for all state points of the phase diagrams , with the exponent @xmath7 as well as the constant found from one single aging experiment . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> , width=330 ]        the above discussed simple aging properties are only expected to apply for liquids with isomorphs , i.e. , strongly correlating liquids . to validate this </S>",
