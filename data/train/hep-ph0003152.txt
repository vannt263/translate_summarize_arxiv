    "another property of eq.([leff ] ) is that the scattered photons in the channel @xmath2 are circularly polarized _ in leading order _ @xcite due to the parity violating terms in @xmath21 .",
    "there is no linear polarization in this channel .    because the scale of @xmath20 is @xmath11 , a typical photon - neutrino cross section is quite small , so small that a high energy neutrino beam is not attenuated by interactions with the present density of relic neutrinos via the process @xmath4 @xcite . in the early universe ,",

    "i.e. _ @xmath23 , one might be justified in speculating that some remnant of the circular polarization mentioned above could be retained in the cosmic microwave background radiation and at this would provide evidence for the relic neutrino background .",
    "lowering the decoupling temperature necessitates increasing the cross section , @xmath24 , or changing the dependence of the age of the universe , @xmath25 , on the temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the latter seems unlikely , since the @xmath27 radiation dominated behavior of the early universe is insensitive changes such as including a non - vanishing cosmological constant . on the other hand",
    ", new interactions could increase @xmath24 , provided they involve the exchange of particles with spin @xmath281 . a new interaction of this type is provided by the recent proposal that the compact dimensions of string theory are sufficiently large to make the effective gravitational scale @xmath29 of order a tev rather than the usual @xmath30gev planck scale @xcite .",
    "that this new gravitational interaction will make a significant correction to the standard model photon - neutrino cross sections can be seen by rewriting eq.([leff ] ) in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the symmetrical energy - momentum tensors of the neutrinos and the photons .",

    "this is followed by the calculation of @xmath35 and a discussion of the resulting astrophysical implications .",
    "according to models in which only the graviton ( @xmath36 ) propagates in the additional @xmath37 compact dimensions of a @xmath38 dimensional manifold , the compact spatial dimension @xmath39 is related to @xmath29 and @xmath40 as @xcite @xmath41 the graviton s propagation in all @xmath42 dimensions implies the existence of a tower of spin 2 particles in ordinary space - time , whose masses are given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and the @xmath45 are integers .",
    "furthermore , in these models the interaction between the spin 2 graviton , @xmath46 , and any standard model field has the universal form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy - momentum tensor of the standard model field .    given the effective coupling , eq.([lgeff ] ) , it is a simple matter to calculate the @xmath1 amplitudes @xcite . in the annihilation channels ( @xmath3 and @xmath49 , the amplitude for a particular @xmath50 has the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the spin 2 projection operator @xmath54 with @xmath55 since the energy - momentum tensors are conserved , symmetrical and , in this case , traceless , eq.([amp1 ] ) reduces to @xmath56 to complete the calculation of the amplitude , it is necessary to sum @xmath57 over the values of @xmath58 .",
    "this is done by replacing the sum with an integral over the number density @xmath59 given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the surface area of an @xmath37-dimensional sphere .",
