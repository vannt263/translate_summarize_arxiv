    "neutron stars are believed to be the remnants of supernova explosions @xcite . they are born hot and rich in leptons . during the very beginning of the evolution ,",
    "an energy of the order of @xmath1 ergs is radiated away from the neutron star by neutrinos , in a process known as deleptonization .",
    "theoretical studies involving different possible equations of state that result in different matter composition have to be performed .",
    "this is because the temporal evolution of the star in the so - called kelvin - helmholtz epoch , during which the remnant compact object changes from a hot and lepton - rich to a cold and deleptonized star , depends on two key ingredients : the equation of state ( eos ) and its associated neutrino opacity at supranuclear densities @xcite .",
    "one class of eos assumes that the neutron star is composed only of hadrons , plus an essential small admixture of electrons . in order to construct appropriate eos s for these hadronic stars ,",
    "one must rely on models which describe nuclear matter bulk properties .",
    "the interior of the neutron star can also include quarks and , in this case , two possibilities have been investigated : hybrid stars , constituted by a hadronic phase and a quark core , or composed only by charge neutral quark matter in @xmath2-equilibrium . in hybrid stars ,",
    "low density regions are composed of hadronic matter , but in high density regions deconfinement of the quarks occurs , leading to the formation of a quark phase .",
    "many different eos s have been built , including eos s for the phase immediately after the formation of the neutron star , when the neutrinos are still trapped , and for the subsequent ( deleptonized ) phases after the neutrinos escape .",
    "the assumption underlying the existence of quark stars is based on the bodmer - witten conjecture @xcite .",
    "these authors have claimed that it is possible that the interior of a neutron - like star does not consist primarily of hadrons , but rather of strange matter ( sm ) , which is composed of deconfined quarks , including up , down and strange quarks , plus the leptons necessary to ensure charge neutrality and @xmath2-equilibrium .",
    "this possibility arises because a phase transition from hadronic to quark phase is possible at densities present in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that strange matter is the true ground state of all matter .",
    "if this is the case , as soon as the core of the star converts to the quark phase , the entire star converts .",
    "sm was first considered in calculations obtained within the mit bag model framework @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated treatments for sm , based on the nanbu - jona - lasinio @xcite , the color flavor locked phase @xcite and the quark - mass density dependent @xcite models also exist in the literature . however , the central densities inside a compact object are not known and its inner composition could well be one of the superconducting phases ( the two - superconduction color phase ( 2sc ) or the cfl phase ) @xcite , but this is still a source of speculation .",
    "hence , investigating the quark phase without taking into account the cfl phase is indeed important and our choice of models for the present work is based on the assumption that the cfl phase transition takes place at higher densities than the deconfinement phase transition @xcite . in the present paper , we restrict ourselves to constant chiral condensates , while an improved discussion should take into account particle - hole inhomogeneous condensates , which can become energetically favorable under certain densities and physical conditions @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient in the sm hypothesis is the stability window , identified with the model parameters that are consistent with the fact that two - flavor quark matter ( 2qm ) must be unstable ( i.e. , at zero temperature its energy per baryon has to be larger than 930 mev , the iron binding energy ) and sm ( three - flavor quark matter ) must be stable ( i.e. , its energy per baryon must be lower than 930 mev , also at @xmath3 ) .",
    "this problem has already been discussed in the literature , but we believe that some aspects deserve more investigation and this is the main goal of the present work . first of all , at zero temperature , the stability window is normally obtained for neutral matter in @xmath2-equilibrium , as for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , one has to bear in mind that stable nuclear matter ( as in iron ) is not charge neutral and does not contain electrons . actually , its proton fraction is @xmath4 , very close to symmetric matter and this is a good reason to analyze also matter with equal quark chemical potentials , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite for zero temperature systems .",
    "moreover , an important characteristic of the deconfinement transition is that deconfined quark matter is transitorily out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that slightly different results are obtained if one considers matter with identical quark chemical potentials , corresponding to equal quantities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks in two - flavor - matter , or charge neutral matter in @xmath2-equilibrium , as expected in stars . for the models under investigation , the stable parameter region is larger if the @xmath2-equilibrium condition and charge neutrality are imposed .",
    "another point worth mentioning refers to finite size effects , very often disregarded in the literature . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if finite size effects are taken into account , iron binding energy is around 4 mev lower , i.e. 934 mev .",
    "however , one can see @xcite that even if finite size effects are taken into account , the stability window remains practically unchanged .",
    "understanding the stability of strange matter in proto - quark stars is also important because it is known that stars cool down slowly after deleptonization . according to numerical simulations , during the first tens of seconds of evolution the proto - neutron star cools from @xmath7 mev ( in the center ) to temperatures below 24 mev .",
    "one does not expect that proto - quark stars are constant in temperature .",
    "actually , it is believed that the entropy per baryon is fixed , so that the temperature varies in the interior of the star , according to its density .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that during the evolution process , different snapshots can be simulated though different entropies per baryon and trapped neutrinos .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for some examples of studies of isolated star evolution .",
    "this analysis is important as it has been shown that evolution of isolated stars differs from the one of stars in binary systems throughout the whole star life @xcite .",
    "the stability window at finite temperature has already been discussed in the past @xcite . in all these papers , except in ref .",
    "@xcite , the importance of the free energy was disregarded , but even in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was introduced in the calculations , the quantity used in the search for stable strange matter was always the binding energy per baryon .",
    "of course , as expected from calculations in the macrocanonical or grand - canonical ensemble , the quantity related to the thermodynamical potential is the free energy per baryon ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 is the free energy density ,",
    "@xmath10 the baryon density , @xmath11 the energy density , @xmath12 the temperature and @xmath13 the entropy density of the system @xcite . for zero temperature systems , the free energy density becomes the energy density and hence , the binding energy per baryon ( @xmath14 ) is analyzed at zero temperature in the search for stable matter .",
    "the choice of appropriate parameters compatible with stable sm at finite temperature systems requires , in addition to the investigation performed at zero temperature , a careful study of the free energy per baryon .",
    "a very similar situation is seen when one looks for the possible existence of the pasta phase in finite systems @xcite .",
    "of course , the lower limits of the stability windows , given by the points where the two - flavor quark matter has an energy per baryon larger than 930 mev , remain the same because the @xmath0 ground state is a zero temperature system .",
    "another important aspect related to neutron stars is their magnetic fields . while magnetars are expected to bear extremely high magnetic fields of up to @xmath15 g on the surface @xcite , all pulsars have magnetic fields of some strength @xcite .",
    "for this reason , any complete analysis of pulsar features , including stability windows , should take into account magnetic field effects .",
    "note that whenever tackling this problem , anisotropy is a matter that has to be carefully considered , once it may be important for ultra high magnetic fields . in this work , however , we are not going to take into account anisotropy of matter , since we are not primarily interested in analyzing macroscopic properties of stars , but general trends of different microscopic models in specific situations .    for the above mentioned reasons , it is appropriate to have a better understanding of stability windows also at finite temperature ( including the case of fixed entropy per baryon ) subject to magnetic fields .",
    "this is the scope of the present paper , organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly discuss the formalism and the eos s of different models ; in section iii we present the results and conclusions and in the last section , the final remarks are drawn .",
    "we discuss next the following models for proto - quark stars : the quark - mass density dependent ( qmdd ) model , the mit bag model and the nanbu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model . we restrict ourselves to the main formulae and refer the reader to previous references for detailed calculations .",
    "we start from the qmdd model @xcite , which is based on a phenomenological approach where the dynamical masses of the three lightest quarks scale inversely with the baryon number density @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the constant energy density in the zero quark density limit .",
    "the pressure , energy density and baryonic density of the system are , respectively , given by @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the degeneracy of each quark @xmath23 taking into account spin and number of colors .",
    "the distribution function for quarks ( @xmath24 ) and antiquarks ( @xmath25 ) are the fermi - dirac distributions @xmath26 \\right]^{-1}$ ] where @xmath27 is the chemical potential of each particle species and @xmath28 .",
    "this model presents a thermodynamical inconsistency which was tackled in different ways in the literature and resulted in different versions of the qmdd model .",
    "this problem was discussed in many papers @xcite and we restrict ourselves to two versions : 1 ) the most commonly used one @xcite , where the pressure at the density corresponding to the minimum of the free energy per baryon could be non - zero , depending on the matter studied ( sm or 2qm ) and to which we refer next as version 1 ( qmddv1 ) and 2 ) the one that presents a remedy to the thermodynamical inconsistency , in such a way that the minimum of the energy per baryon corresponds to the point of zero pressure @xcite , and to which we refer as version 2 ( qmddv2 ) .",
    "the confinement parameter values for which the stability windows are obtained in different versions of the model at zero temperature are different , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .      for the mit bag model @xcite",
    "the quark masses are fixed .",
    "therefore , expressions ( [ pressao_qmdd ] ) , ( [ densidade_energia_qmdd ] ) and ( [ densidade_quarks_qmdd ] ) have @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 and @xmath31 by a bag constant @xmath32 .",
    "we take advantage of the simplicity of this model and include magnetic field effects in the calculation . in this case , the main expressions are written next ( see ref .",

    "the difference now is that both spin projections contribute for landau levels @xmath36 , but only one of them contributes for @xmath37 .",
    "the sum in the landau levels runs until the last one is filled ( strictly , it goes up to infinity ) .",
    "numerically , we have developed a robust way to check for the convergence of the results .",
    "when they no longer change with a very good precision , we are certain that the last possible level for a fixed magnetic field was filled .",
    "the same procedure is valid for all models with magnetic fields at finite temperature because only at zero temperature the maximum landau level has a definite value .",
