    "chaos synchronization has been receiving a great deal of interest for more than two decades in view of its potential applications in various fields of science @xcite . since the identification of chaotic synchronization ,",
    "different kinds of synchronizations have been proposed in interacting chaotic systems , which have all been identified both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "complete synchronization refers to a perfect locking of chaotic trajectories so as to remain in step with each other in the course of time , @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "generalized synchronization is defined as the presence of some functional relationship between the states of the drive and the response , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "phase synchronization is characterized by entrainment of the phases of the two signals , whereas their amplitudes remain uncorrelated  @xcite .",
    "lag synchronization implies that there is an exact time shift between the evolution of drive and response systems , where the response lags the state of the drive , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "anticipating synchronization also appears as a coincidence of shifted - in - time states of the two systems , where the response anticipates the state of drive , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "recently intermittent lag synchronization has also been identified  @xcite .",
    "also it has been shown very recently in a three - element network module of semiconductor laser system that dynamical relaying can lead to zero - lag synchronization even in the presence of coupling delays  @xcite .    the notion of time dependent delay ( tdd ) with stochastic or chaotic modulation in time - delay systems",
    "was introduced by kye _",
    "et al _ @xcite to understand the behaviour of dynamical systems with time dependent topology .",
    "these authors have reported that in a time - delay system with tdd , the reconstructed phase trajectory does not collapse to a simple manifold , a property different from that of delayed systems with fixed delay time ( which is considered to be a serious drawback of the later type of systems ) .",
    "it has been shown very recently that a distributed delay enriches the characteristic features of the delayed system over that of the fixed delay systems @xcite .",
    "based on these considerations , current studies on chaotic synchronization in time - delay systems are focused towards time - delay systems with time dependent delay @xcite . in this connection it is also of considerable interest to study the effect of simple modulations such as periodic modulation @xcite on the nature of the chaotic attractor .",
    "recently , we have studied chaotic synchronization in a system of two unidirectionally coupled odd piecewise linear time - delay systems  @xcite with two different constant delay times : one in the coupling term and the other in the individual systems , namely , feedback delay .",
    "we have shown that there is a transition from anticipatory to lag synchronization through complete synchronization as a function of a system parameter with suitable stability criterion .",
    "the present work was motivated by the fact that whether there arises any new phenomenon due to the introduction of periodic delay time modulation in the coupled time - delay system we have studied earlier and its effects on the various synchronization scenario .",
    "interestingly , we have found that even with simple periodic modulation , the time - delay system can not be collapsed into a simple manifold and that the delay time can not be extracted using standard methods .",
    "more interestingly , we have also found that the fully rectified sinusoidal modulation of delay time introduces a new type of oscillating synchronization that oscillates between anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations for the case of constant coupling delay .",
    "this is further corroborated by suitable stability condition based on krasovskii - lyapunov theory .",
    "intermittent anticipatory and lag synchronizations are also found to exist in the present system for the case of identical modulation in both the coupling and feedback delay , for a range of modulational frequencies .",
    "in addition , we also find that there exist regions of exact anticipatory and lag synchronizations for lower values of modulational frequencies .",
    "the results have been corroborated by the nature of similarity functions and the intermittent behavior by the probability distribution of the laminar phase , satisfying universal @xmath0 power law behavior of on - off intermittency  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the scalar piece - wise linear time - delay system with delay time modulation and explore the dynamical change in the time series of the time - delay system due to delay time modulation . in sec .",
    "iii we have introduced a unidirectional time - delay coupling with delay time modulation between the two scalar time - delay systems and we have identified the condition for stability of the synchronized state following krasovskii - lyapunov theory .",
    "a new type of oscillating synchronization that oscillates between anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations and vice versa is shown to exist in sec .",
    "iv for the case of constant coupling delay and with modulated feedback delay . in sec .",
    "v , we have pointed out the existence of intermittent anticipatory synchronization when the strength of the coupling delay is less than that of the feedback delay with identical modulations , while in sec .",
    "vi , complete synchronization is realized when the two delays are equal .",
    "intermittent lag synchronization is shown to set in when the coupling delay exceeds the feedback delay in sec .",
    "vii . in sec .",
    "viii we very briefly indicate the possibility of more complicated oscillating synchronizations in the case of nonidentical modulations . finally in sec .",
    "ix , we summarize our results .",
    "at first , we will introduce the single scalar time - delay system with piecewise linearity in the presence of delay time modulation , which has been studied in detail for its chaotic dynamics in references @xcite with constant time - delay . then some measures to estimate the delay time will be discussed both in the presence and in the absence of delay time modulation to show that the imprints of the delay time carved out of the time series of the chaotic attractor are completely wiped out by the modulation of delay time .",
    "we consider the following first order delay differential equation introduced by lu and he  @xcite and discussed in detail by thangavel _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters , @xmath8 is the constant time - delay and @xmath9 is an odd piecewise linear function defined as @xmath10 recently , we have reported @xcite that system ( [ eqonea ] ) exhibits hyperchaotic behavior for the parameter values @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the hyperchaotic nature was confirmed by the existence of multiple positive lyapunov exponents ( see figures 1 and 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "now , we wish to replace the time - delay parameter @xmath8 as a function of time for our present study , instead of the constant time - delay , in the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the zero frequency component , @xmath15 is the amplitude and @xmath16 is the frequency of the modulation .",
    "note that in the delay term , we have introduced the fully rectified sinusoidal modulational form ( absolute of the sine term ) so as to keep the delay time positive even for values of @xmath17 so as to avoid acausality problem in eq .",
    "( [ eqonea ] ) for negative values of @xmath8 when @xmath17 .",
    "however , for values of @xmath14 sufficiently greater than @xmath15 the rectification in the modulation ( [ eqonec ] ) is not required .",
    "recently , the concept of time dependent delay with stochastic or chaotic modulation was introduced by kye _",
    "@xcite in the time - delay systems and they have shown in the case of mackey - glass system that the delay time carved out of time series of the time - delay system is undetectable by the conventional measures and hence any reconstruction of phase space of the delayed system is hardly possible .",
    "this fact has motivated some authors @xcite to look for delay systems with delay time modulation as an ideal candidate for secure communication .",
    "interestingly we find here that even with a fully rectified sinusoidal delay time modulation of the form ( [ eqonec ] ) , system ( [ eqonea ] ) exhibits the properties studied by kye _",
    "et al _ with stochastic or chaotic modulation .",
    "in order to demonstrate the effect of fully rectified sinusoidal delay time modulation of the form ( [ eqonec ] ) on the time series of the piecewise linear time - delay system which we have considered here , we will calculate _ ( 1 ) filling factor _",
    "@xcite , _ ( 2 ) length of polygon line _ @xcite and _ ( 3 ) average mutual information _ @xcite both in the presence and in the absence of delay time modulation and show how periodic modulation removes any imprints of the time - delay .",
    "now we will compute the filling factor @xcite for the chaotic trajectory @xmath18 of the time - delay system ( [ eqonea ] ) by projecting it onto the pseudospace @xmath19 with @xmath20 equally sized hypercubes , where the delayed time series @xmath21 is constructed from @xmath18 for various values of @xmath22 .",
    "the filling factor is the number of hypercubes which are visited by the projected trajectory , normalized to the total number of hypercubes , @xmath20 .",

    "figure  [ ff]c is plotted for @xmath28 and @xmath24 to show that the disappearance of local minima in fig .  [ ff]b is not due to large delays but only because of delay time modulation . from the figures one can realize that the imprints of the delay time embedded in the projected trajectory is completely ironed out due to the presence of delay time modulation .      next , to calculate the length of polygon line @xcite , the trajectory in @xmath19 space is restricted to a two dimensional surface .",
    "the restriction in dimension is effected by intersecting the projected trajectory with a surface @xmath29 . consequently the number of times the trajectory traverses the surface and the corresponding intersection points can be calculated .",
    "one then orders the points with respect to the values of @xmath30 , and a simple measure for the alignment of the points is the length @xmath31 of polygon line connecting all the ordered points .",

    "[ ami]b is due to delay time modulation and not because of large delay . for fixed delay time",
    "the average mutual information shows local peaks at the time - delay @xmath43 ( or multiples of it @xmath44 ) of the system , whereas for the case of delay time modulation the average mutual information has no such peaks to identify the delay time of the delayed system .",
    "one can also obtain similar results with other measures such as autocorrelation function , onestep prediction error and average fitting error @xcite .",
    "however , we are not presenting these results here for convenience . in order to perform the phase space reconstruction ,",
    "the first step is to find out the delay time for the projected trajectories . by introducing the delay time modulation the imprints of delay time in the projected trajectory",
    "is completely removed as seen above for the present system , inhibiting any possibility of phase space reconstruction .",
    "this is essentially consequent of the fact that when the delay time is modulated by the fully rectified sine term , the delay time effectively gets increased in which case the number of positive lyapunov exponent also increases ( as noted in fig . 2 in ref .",
    "consequently study of chaos synchronization in a system of such coupled delay time modulated oscillators will be of considerable interest .",
    "now let us consider the following unidirectionally coupled drive @xmath45 and response @xmath46 systems with two different modulated time - delays @xmath47 and @xmath48 as feedback and coupling time - delays , respectively ( hereafter we write @xmath47 and @xmath48 simply as @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively ) ,    @xmath51    [ eq.one ]    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is of the same form as in eq .",

    "the condition ( [ eq.four ] ) indeed corresponds to the stability condition for exact anticipatory / lag as well as exact complete synchronizations for a given value of the coupling delay @xmath50 in a global sense .",
    "it may be noted that the stability condition ( [ eq.four ] ) is valid irrespective of the nature of the coupling delay , that is whether it is constant or modulated .",

    "curve  3 is plotted for the value of @xmath166 ( which is greater than both @xmath185 and @xmath186 ) , where the minimum of similarity function @xmath183 occurs at a finite value of @xmath187 and hence there is a lack of lag synchronization between the drive and the response signals indicating asynchronization .",
    "curve  2 corresponds to the value of @xmath154 , ( which is less than @xmath185 but greater than @xmath186 ) , where the minimum of similarity function @xmath183 is approximately zero ( of the order of @xmath168 , as may be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ lintsim ] ) indicating the existence of intermittent lag synchronization with the amplitude of the laminar phase being approximately zero .",
    "however , for the value of @xmath132 , for which the general condition ( [ eq.four ] ) is obeyed , the minimum of similarity function for curve 1 becomes much closer to zero ( of the order @xmath171 ) which corresponds to intermittent lag synchronization with exact time shift between the two signals during the laminar phase .",
    "next , as in the case of intermittent anticipatory synchronization , by reducing the value of modulational frequency one can find that the lengths of the laminar phases increase with vanishing turbulent phases and finally at an appropriate value of the modulational frequency there exists exact lag synchronization without any intermittent bursts provided the exact stability condition is satisfied .",
    "correspondingly the similarity function @xmath183 becomes zero exactly ( which is of the order @xmath151 ) for @xmath188 in this case .",
    "finally , when @xmath189 or / and @xmath190 the frequencies as well as amplitudes of the modulated feedback delay @xmath191 and the modulated coupling delay @xmath192 differ from each other resulting in a more complicated variation of the anticipating / lag time @xmath193 .",
    "this in turn results in the existence of more complex oscillating synchronization than the one presented in sec .",
    "it is clear that one can also introduce other kinds of modulations instead of periodic modulation to obtain varying forms of oscillating synchronizations .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that there exists a new type of oscillating synchronization that oscillates between anticipatory , complete and lag synchronization and vice versa for the case of constant coupling delay with varying anticipating and lag times .",
    "we have also shown that there exists regions of intermittent anticipatory synchronization , intermittent lag synchronization and complete synchronization in the parameter space of @xmath146 and @xmath50 with appropriate stability condition for the synchronized state in a system of two piecewise linear time - delay systems with delay time modulation in both the feedback and coupling delay . for a fixed value of @xmath146",
    ", we have shown that there is a transition from intermittent anticipatory to intermittent lag synchronization through complete synchronization with the coupling delay @xmath50 as the only control parameter , while all the other parameters are kept fixed .",
    "we have also found that on further reducing the value of @xmath146 , one can observe transition towards exact anticipatory / lag synchronizations from their intermittent behaviour .",
    "the signature of the intermittent behavior in both the intermittent anticipatory and intermittent lag synchronizations are characterized by probability distribution of laminar phases satisfying a universal asymptotic @xmath0 power law distribution .",
    "the existence of intermittent anticipatory and intermittent lag synchronizations are characterized by their corresponding similarity functions .",
    "further , we have observed that in the region where the stringent stability condition ( [ eq.four ] ) is satisfied , the minimum of the similarity functions @xmath162 and @xmath183 approaches very closely zero for all values of @xmath69 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the range of zero values corresponding to the minimum of similarity functions @xmath162 and @xmath183 shows the existence of anticipatory and lag synchronizations for the values of coupling delay @xmath50 below and above the feedback delay @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we have also shown that the estimation of the delay time carved out of the time series of the delayed system even with delay time modulations of fully rectified sinusoidal type is very difficult by conventional methods in the present system for suitable choice of the parameters ( in contrast to the chaotic or stochastic delay time modulation as studied by kye _",
    "et al _ @xcite in mackey - glass delay system ) and so the messages encoded in such systems can be expected to be less amenable for extraction by phase space reconstruction . we have also confirmed numerically that the phenomena reported in this paper occur in other time - delay systems such as mackey - glass and ikeda systems also to corroborate the generic nature of the results .",
    "also the model system discussed in the present manuscript is amenable for experimental realization in terms of suitable nonlinear electronic circuits in view of its piecewise linear nature and we are pursuing the experimental verification of it .",
    "it is hoped that the study of such modulated systems will lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of systems with time dependent topologies such as neural networks , world wide web , etc .",
