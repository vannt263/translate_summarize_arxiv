    "recent months have seen a significant advance in heegaard floer theory : it turned out that certain heegaard floer homologies admit a purely combinatorial description . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the heegaard floer homologies of a knot can be computed from a grid diagram of the knot by a simple combinatorial procedure .",
    "heegaard floer homology @xmath0 of a 3-manifold @xmath1 also admits a combinatorial description @xcite , but this description is less straighforward .",
    "starting from an arbitary admissible heegaard diagram of @xmath1 , one has to change the @xmath2 curves by isotopies and handleslides so that in the resulting heegaard diagram almost all the domains of holomorphic disks are squares or bigons .",
    "it is then easy to understand the moduli spaces of the holomorphic disks needed to compute the differential , since squares and bigons with maslov index = 1 admit a unique holomorphic representative .",
    "( we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic setup of the heegaard floer theory ; see @xcite for a survey . )    for a contact 3-manifold @xmath3 , ozsvth and szab introduce an invariant @xmath4 which is a distinguished element of @xmath5 ( defined up to sign for the theory with @xmath6 coefficients)@xcite .",
    "since non - vanishing of @xmath4 implies that @xmath7 is tight , this invariant gives a powerful tool for establishing the tightness of a contact structure @xcite .",
    "the invariant @xmath4 is defined in @xcite via an open book decomposition of @xmath3 , as follows .",
    "if the genus of the page of the open book is @xmath8 ( and the binding is connected ) , we consider a certain heegaard diagram for @xmath1 of genus @xmath9 , compatible with the open book .",
    "the generators of the group @xmath10 are given by @xmath11-tuples of the intersection points of @xmath12- and @xmath2-curves in the diagram , and a distinguished @xmath11-tuple gives a cycle @xmath13 which descends to the invariant @xmath4 in homology .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath4 can be computed in a combinatorial fashion .",
    "we would like to apply sarkar ",
    "wang algorithm @xcite to obtain a heegaard diagram where the holomorphic disks can be easily identified .",
    "however , we are concerned with a specific cycle , not the homology group as a whole , and the isotopies and/or handleslides of the @xmath2-curves performed on the heegaard surface would possibly affect the generator @xmath13 . indeed , the homology class of a geometric generator @xmath13 can change even if all the isotopies are supported away from the intersection points forming @xmath13 ; @xmath13 might even no longer be a cycle after the isotopy .",
    "consider for example the genus 1 heegaard diagram for @xmath14 given by an @xmath12 and a @xmath2 curve on the torus intersecting at one point .",
    "this intersection point @xmath15 is a cycle which generates @xmath16 .",
    "we isotope the @xmath2-curve to introduce two extra intersection points , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as shown on figure [ isotopies ] , now , we have @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the chain complex @xmath21 for the new heegaard diagram ; so @xmath15 is no longer a cycle , and @xmath22 is generated by @xmath23 .",
    "-curve , @xmath15 is no longer a cycle in the heegaard floer complex . ]",
    "this shows that we need to be more careful .",
    "fortunately , there is an alternate geometric description of @xmath4 due to honda ",
    "mati : in @xcite , they show that @xmath4 can be found from a heegaard diagram which is different from and somewhat simpler that the one in @xcite .",
    "this alternative heegaard diagram is easier to handle , and fits well with the sarkar ",
    "wang algorithm .",
    "we combine the arguments from @xcite and @xcite to establish our main result in the next section .",
    "we first recall the construction from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 be an open book decomposition for the contact manifold @xmath25 ; here @xmath26 denotes the page of the open book , and @xmath27 the monodromy .",
    "this means that @xmath1 is homeomorphic to @xmath28/\\sim$ ] , where the equivalence relation @xmath29 is given by @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the open book produces a heegaard splitting @xmath31 , with @xmath32/\\sim$ ] , @xmath33/\\sim$ ] .",
    "the heegaard diagram for @xmath1 can then be given by the heegaard surface @xmath34 , and the @xmath12- and @xmath2-curves , defined as follows .",
    "consider a set of disjoint , properly embedded arcs @xmath35 on @xmath26 such that @xmath36 is a single polygon .",
    "obtain arcs @xmath37 by changing the arcs @xmath38 via a small isotopy so that the endpoints of @xmath38 are isotopied along @xmath39 ( in the direction dictated by the boundary orientation ) , the arcs @xmath38 and @xmath37 intersect transversely at one point , and the sign of this intersection in positive ( the orientation of @xmath37 is induced from the orientation of @xmath38 by the isotopy ) .",
    "the curves @xmath40)$ ] and @xmath41)$ ] form attaching circles for the handlebodies @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; they can be thought of as the @xmath12- and @xmath2- curves on @xmath44 .",
    "we can write @xmath45 thus , the intersection of @xmath12- and @xmath2- curves with @xmath46 is completely standard ( and given by @xmath38 , @xmath37 ) ; the picture on @xmath47 depends on the monodromy @xmath27 . for an illustration of such heegaard diagram ,",
    "see @xcite , or look at the example in the next section .",
    "the basepoint @xmath48 is placed on @xmath46 in the polygonal region ( not in the thin strips between @xmath38 s and @xmath37 s ) ; we denote this polygonal region by @xmath49 .",
    "now , let @xmath50 be the intersection point between @xmath38 and @xmath37 on @xmath46 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the element @xmath51 is a cycle which descends to the element @xmath4 in homology @xmath52 .",
    "( note that the roles of the @xmath12- and @xmath2-curves are interchanged because we need the homology of @xmath53 instead of the homology of @xmath1 .",
    "so for a heegaard diagram of genus @xmath8 , a whitney disk from @xmath15 to @xmath17 is now a map @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is mapped into @xmath58 , while @xmath59 is mapped into @xmath60 .",
    "this does not affect the combinatorial algorithm that we will be using later . )",
    "applying the idea of sarkar  wang , we would like to find an open book decomposition for @xmath1 such that all but one regions in the corresponding heegaard diagram are bigons or squares ( here and below , a region is a connected component in the complement of @xmath12- and @xmath2-curves in @xmath44 ) .",
    "[ mythm ] there exists an open book @xmath61 for @xmath3 , such that the heegaard diagram described above has only disk and square regions ( except for the polygonal region @xmath62 ) .",
    "the monodromy @xmath63 differs from the monodromy of given open book @xmath24 by an isotopy , i.e. @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a diffeomorphism fixing the boundary and isotopic to identity .",
    "the algorithm of @xcite tells us to get rid of non - disk regions and @xmath66-gons with @xmath67 by performing isotopies ( finger moves ) of @xmath2-curves .",
    "first , the non - disks are killed ; then , the @xmath66-gons are dealt with ( one after another ) roughly as follows .",
    "we look at the `` distance '' between a given region @xmath68 and the region @xmath49 ( the minimal number of intersections between the @xmath2-curves and an arc connecting @xmath48 to an interior point of @xmath68 ) , and number all the regions @xmath49 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , etc , so that the distance between @xmath71 and @xmath49 increases with @xmath72 .",
    "sarkar and wang explain how to perform finger moves that break up a given @xmath66-gon @xmath73 into polygons with fewer sides , pushing part of the boundary of @xmath66-gon into other regions ( typically labelled with smaller numbers ) . during this process ,",
    "the regions @xmath74 with @xmath75 which are already bigons or squares remain bigons or squares , so the process eventually terminates .",
    "we observe that for our heegaard diagram coming from an open book , all the finger moves can be performed in the @xmath76 part of @xmath44 , since every boundary curve of every region in @xmath44 intersects @xmath76 .",
    "apart from the finger moves , handleslides of the @xmath2-curves are sometimes needed in the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "after such a handleslide , the heegaard diagram would no longer be compatible with considerations in @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that the need for handleslides fortunately does not arise in our case .",
    "indeed , a handleslide in @xcite is only needed when a finger is pushed through a collection of adjacent regions , none of which has a smaller distance from @xmath49 ( in particular , none of these regions is @xmath49 ) , and then comes back to the region where it started .",
    "this means that the finger goes around a full copy of some curve @xmath77 . because each of the @xmath2-curves forms part of the boundary of @xmath49 , and @xmath38 and @xmath37 intersect at one point in @xmath46 , it follows that the finger has to go through @xmath49 , which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore , we can obtain a `` nice '' heegaard diagram by performing a sequence of isotopies on @xmath78 ( away from boundary ) .",
    "a composition of these isotopies gives a diffeomorphism @xmath79 and the open book @xmath80 equivalent to the open book @xmath24 we started with .",
    "as shown in @xcite , finding the differentials in the `` hat '' heegaard floer complex for the diagram that we obtained is now a combinatorial matter .",
    "let @xmath8 be the genus of our heegaard diagram ; stabilizing the open book if necessary , we can assume that @xmath81 .",
    "we consider a generic almost complex structure on @xmath82 which is a small perturbation of the product complex structure , and look for holomorphic representatives of a whitney disk @xmath83 connecting the points @xmath15 and @xmath17 ; the domain of @xmath79 is then a linear combination of some regions @xmath84 , @xmath85 . if @xmath79 has holomorphic representatives , we must have @xmath86 .",
    "we assume that the maslov index of @xmath79 is 1 .",
    "it remains to cite    ( @xcite ) under these conditions , @xmath79 has a unique holomorphic representative .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 is either an embedded square tiled by squares , or a bigon tiled by squares and a bigon .",
    "we conclude this section with the following    if we only want to find out whether the invariant @xmath4 vanishes or not ( without pinpointing it in the homology group @xmath5 ) , it often suffices to simplify the regions that contribute to the moduli spaces for the differentials possibly killing the element @xmath13 .",
    "these are the regions passing through the `` thin strips '' on @xmath87 ; all of them are adjacent to @xmath49 , so they can be converted into bigons or squares simply by pushing parts of their boundary into @xmath49 .",
    "if we find any points @xmath15 such that the expression for @xmath88 contains @xmath13 , we will need to understand the full boundary of @xmath15 ( and so to convert more regions into bigons or squares ) ; however , all the other regions in the heegaard diagram may be left as is .",
    "in this section we illustrate the combinatorial calculation of @xmath4 by the following example .",
    "( we consider @xmath89 coefficents for simplicity , and only show that @xmath4 is non - zero without computing @xmath90 ) .",
    "consider the contact manifold @xmath3 given by the open book whose page is a four - punctured sphere , and the monodromy is the composition of positive dehn twists around the boundary curves @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and a negative dehn twist around the curve @xmath95 ( see figure [ lantern ] ) .",
    "( since the curves are disjoint , the order in which the dehn twists are performed is not important . )",
    "this open book is easy to understand without heegaard floer theory : using the lantern relation @xcite , we can express the monodromy as the product @xmath96 of the positive dehn twists around the curves @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "by @xcite , this shows that @xmath7 is stein fillable ( and therefore tight ) ; moreover , we can perform two positive destabilizations to see that @xmath7 is in fact simply the standard tight contact structure on @xmath99 ( given by the open book with an annular page and trivial monodromy ) .",
    "our point , however , is to apply theorem [ mythm ] and to perform a calculation for the original open book .",
    "first , we look at the honda  kazez ",
    "mati - style heegaard diagram for @xmath3 ( figure [ shadediag ] ) .",
    "observe that there are two `` bad '' regions : a non - disk region ( hatched ) and a hexagonal region ( shaded ) in the complement of @xmath12 and @xmath2 curves on the heegaard surface .    .",
    "the surfaces @xmath76 and @xmath46 , the `` bottom '' and `` top '' parts of @xmath44 , are shown separately ( @xmath46 is smaller because it s completely standard ) .",
    "note that @xmath100 ; the picture shows @xmath76 , not @xmath101 .",
    "the thin curves are the @xmath12-curves , the thicker lines ( solid , dashed and dash - dotted ) are the @xmath2-curves .",
    "the contact element @xmath102 lies on @xmath46 .",
    "the `` bad '' regions on @xmath44 are shown . ]",
    "we get rid of them by applying the sarkar ",
    "wang algorithm as described in theorem [ mythm ] , which in this case amounts simply to winding two of the @xmath2-curves as shown in figure [ winddiag ] : as explained in the end of section 2 , we just have to push fingers out of bad regions into @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain a heegaard diagram shown on figure [ winddiag ] . examining it",
    ", we see that there is only one possible domain of a differential going to @xmath13 from another point @xmath15 ; the point @xmath103 is shown in the picture , and the domain is shaded .",
    "( recall that the intersection of all such domains with @xmath46 should lie in the thin strips between @xmath38 and @xmath37 , since the domain must not contain @xmath48 . )",
    "but then we have @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , since there is a bigon connecting @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( and no other whitney disks from @xmath15 ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath13 is not a boundary , and so @xmath106 . we can conclude that the contact structure @xmath7 is tight .",
