    "the density profile for smaller @xmath74 is steeper at both the inner and the outer regions .",
    "additionally , for different @xmath74 the concentrations of the haloes are different too ( a detailed description of the way the concentration is calculated is given below ) . the system that results for @xmath119 has @xmath120 , while the one for @xmath118 has @xmath121 . in order to calculate the density profiles ( that will be presented below )",
    ", we used as a basic criterion the concentrations of the present - day structures .",
    "in fact , we have chosen the values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 for spect1 and spect2 respectively , because the concentrations resulting from these values are close to the results of the toy - model of bkpd .",
    "this model is constructed by bkpd to reproduce the results of their n - body simulations and it is able to give the concentration @xmath124 of a virial mass @xmath125 at any scale factor @xmath25 .",
    "first , the scale factor @xmath59 at the epoch of collapse is calculated , solving the following equation @xmath126=\\sigma[fm_\\rmn{vir}(a)]\\ ] ] where @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the typical collapsing mass .",

    "we recall that the typical collapsing mass at scale factor @xmath25 satisfies @xmath131=1.686d(1)/d(a)$ ] .",
    "it is obvious that the above defined concentration depends only on the cosmology and the power spectrum used .",
    "thus , for given cosmology and halo mass , the concentration @xmath132 is known _ a priori _ without taking into consideration any particular form of halo growth .",
    "we applied this toy - model to find @xmath132 for the present - day structures .    another way to calculate the concentration is by using @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the radius where the logarithmic slope of the density profile equals 2 .",
    "this radius is found by the following procedure : first , the resulting density profiles are fitted by the general formula of eq.1 .",
    "this is done by minimizing the sum @xmath135 ^ 2.\\ ] ] where @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are fitting parameters .",
    "the minimization is performed using the unconstrained subroutine zxmwd of imsl mathematical library .",
    "then , @xmath134 is found by applying the following formula for @xmath141 @xmath142^{1/\\mu}r_s\\ ] ] this formula gives the radius @xmath143 at which the logarithmic slope equals to @xmath144 . according to the model presented in this paper , haloes grow inside - out .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath124 represents the way of halo growth . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the concentration is plotted as a function of the present - day virial mass . from the top of the figure , the first pair of curves ( solid and dotted ) correspond to spect1 and the second pair to spect2 .",
    "solid curves show our results while dotted curves depict the results of the toy - model of bkpd . a very good agreement between the values of the concentration",
    "in particular , concentrations resulting from spect2 are in agreement with those obtained for the model of bkpd for the whole range of mass presented . on the other hand ,",
    "small differences appear for very small and very large masses in the case of spect1 .            in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we present the density profiles of the resulting structures with present - day masses in the range of @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "the left - hand side figures ( a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , e1 ) have been produced using spect1 , while the right - hand ones using spect2 . figures ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) correspond to mass @xmath145 , ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) have mass @xmath117 , ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) to mass @xmath147 , ( d1 ) and ( d2 ) to mass @xmath148 and ( e1 ) and ( e2 ) correspond to mass @xmath146 .",
    "solid lines represent the resulting density profiles while dotted lines are the fits using the general formula of eq.1 .",
    "it is shown that the fits using the general formula of eq.1 are exact .",
    "we also fit every halo density profile using the analytical models that have been proposed in the literature ( h90 , nfw , mgqsl , js ) and are described in section 1 .",
    "the best fit of these models to our resulting profiles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( circles ) .",
    "this best fit is found by the minimizing procedure described above , for @xmath149 and @xmath140 constants and equal to the proposed values , while @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the only fitting parameters .",
    "best fit for the resulting density profile in ( a1 ) is the h90 model , in ( a2 ) and ( b2 ) the nfw model , in ( b1 ) , ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) the mgqsl model and in ( d1 ) , ( d2 ) , ( e1 ) and ( e2 ) the js model .",
    "additionally , haloes of different mass are fitted well by different analytical models .",
    "this is due to the different inner and outer slopes of the density profiles .",
    "inner slope , ( defined as that at radial distance @xmath150 ) , is an increasing function of the virial mass of the halo .",
    "for example , in the case of spect2 the inner slope varies from @xmath151 for @xmath152 to @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "additionally , outer slope -at @xmath155- is a decreasing function of the virial mass and it varies from @xmath156 to @xmath157 for the above range of masses .     as a function of present - day virial mass for both power spectra .",
    "it is shown that @xmath138 is an increasing function of the virial mass .",
    "solid curve : spect1 .",
    "dashed curve : spect2 ]    although density profiles resulting in simulations seem to be similar , systematic trends that relate them with the power spectrum have been reported .",
    "for example , subramanian , cen & ostriker @xcite found in the results of their n - body simulations the following : for power spectra of the form @xmath158 the density profiles have steeper cores for larger @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , a dependence of the density profile on the power spectrum is expected .",
    "this dependence is shown in our results comparing the profiles of haloes with the same present day mass .",
    "it should be noted that the method studied in this manuscript is applicable for the era of slow accretion when the infalling matter is in the form of small haloes that have mass less than @xmath159 times the mass of the parent halo .",
    "this kind of accretion occurs at the late stages of formation and thus determines the profile of the outer regions of the halo under study .",
    "however , the values of the inner slopes may be questionable .",
    "real haloes have followed different mass growth histories and thus their properties show a significant scatter about a mean value .",
    "unfortunately , the method studied in this manuscript results one profile for a halo of given mass .",
    "thus , its purpose is just to approximate the mean density profile of a large number of mass growth histories .",
    "since the mass growth history resulting from the method is in good agreement with the mean growth history resulting from n - body simulation -as it will be shown below- then the values of the inner slopes could be close to the ones of n - body simulations .",
    "a monte carlo analytic approach based on the construction of a large number of mass accretion histories is under study .",
    "this study could answer to some of the above problems .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the exponent @xmath138 is plotted , that gives the asymptotic slope at @xmath160 , derived by the general fit as a function of present - day virial mass for both power spectra .",
    "it is shown that the exponent @xmath138 is an increasing function of virial mass .",
    "this trend of the inner density profile is also found in the results of recent n - body simulations ( ricotti @xcite ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot mass growth curves .",
    "the curves show @xmath161 as a function of @xmath25 in a logarithmic slope .",
    "the solid lines show our resulting structures and the dotted lines show the mass growth curves of the model proposed by wechsler et al . @xcite .",
    "the curves of the left panel correspond to spect1 while those of the right panel to spect2 . from the top to the bottom , the curves correspond to masses @xmath162 , @xmath117 , @xmath163 , @xmath148 and @xmath164 respectively .",
    "it is obvious that massive haloes show substantial increase of their mass up to late times while the growth curves of less massive haloes tend to flatten out earlier .",
    "this behaviour of mass growth curves characterizes the hierarchical clustering scenario where small haloes are formed earlier than more massive ones .",
    "additionally , it helps to define the term `` formation time '' by a measurable way .",
    "wechsler et al .",
    "@xcite define as formation scale factor @xmath165 the scale factor when the logarithmic slope of mass growth , ( @xmath166 ) , falls below some specified value , @xmath167 .",
    "they use the value @xmath168 .",
    "it should be noted that this definition of formation scale factor differs from @xmath59 , defined by bkpd , since @xmath59 is the value of the scale factor at the epoch the typical collapsing mass is @xmath169 times the virial mass of the halo .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath165 and @xmath59 for @xmath127 and @xmath168 are different .",
    "this is also noticed in wechsler et al .",
    "@xcite since they state that @xmath165  and @xmath59 have similar values for @xmath168 but for @xmath170 . however , the use of the value @xmath170 in the toy - model of bkpd changes the resulting concentrations and so our basic criterion for the choice of the threshold @xmath74 is not satisfied .",
    "therefore , it is preferable to choose a different value of @xmath167 for the definition of @xmath165 , that of @xmath171 . in fig.[fig6 ] , the dotted lines show the mass growth curves of the model proposed by wechsler et al . @xcite . in this model",
    "the mass growth is calculated using the relation : @xmath172\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is the present - day virial mass and the formation scale factor @xmath165 is defined by the condition @xmath174 with @xmath171 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , a very satisfactory agreement is shown , particularly for the less massive haloes .",
    "we have to note that our model haloes grow inside - out .",
    "therefore , in early enough times -when the slope of the density is smaller that @xmath8 all the way from the centre up to the current radius- it is meaningless to define @xmath175 .",
    "once the building of the halo has proceeded beyond the point with slope 2 , the evolution of @xmath124 is due to the growth of the virial radius and is given by @xmath176=c_\\rmn{vir}(m_0)\\frac{r_\\rmn{vir}[m(a)]}{r_\\rmn{vir}(m_0)},\\ ] ] where @xmath177 denotes the present - day concentration and @xmath178 $ ] and @xmath179 are the values of the virial radius at scale factor @xmath25 and at the present - day respectively . in fig .

    "more massive haloes have lower concentrations that evolve slower , while the concentrations of less massive haloes are higher and evolve more rapidly .",
    "since the formation of structures in a hierarchical clustering scenario is a complicated process , any attempt for the construction of analytical models requires a number of crucial assumptions .",
    "the model studied in this paper was proposed by mrsss and assumes that    1 .",
    "the rate of mass accretion is defined by the rate of minor mergers 2 .",
    "haloes grow inside - out .",
    "the accreted mass is deposited at the outer shells without changing the density profile of the halo inside its current virial radius    the first assumption indicates that structures presented in this paper formed by a gentle accretion of mass .",
    "the physical process implied by the second assumption is that the infalling matter does not penetrate the current virial radius .",
    "this process requires an amount of non - radial motion .",
    "this amount has to be large enough so that the pericenter of the accreted mass is larger than the current virial radius",
    ". it should be noted that a density profile that results from a radial collapse has inner slope steeper than @xmath8 .",
    "it is the presence of non - radial motion during the collapse that leads to inner slopes shallower than @xmath180 ( e.g. nusser @xcite , hiotelis @xcite , subramanian , cen & ostriker @xcite ) .",
    "non - radial motions are always present in the structures formed in n - body simulations .    despite the above assumptions , the results of the model studied in this paper are in good agreement with the results of n - body simulations .",
    "the summary of these results is as follows :    1 .",
    "density profiles of haloes are close to the analytical models proposed in the literature as good fits to the results of n - body simulations .",
    "a trend of the inner slope of the density profile as an increasing function of the mass of the halo is also found , in agreement with recent results of n - body simulations .",

    "growth curves of less massive haloes tend to flatten out earlier .",
    "the concentrations of less massive haloes evolve more rapidly while those of more massive haloes evolve slowly .",
    "taking into account the number of assumptions and approximations used to build the model presented in this paper , we can conclude that the agreement with the results of n - body simulations is very good .",

    "<S> an inside - out model for the formation of haloes in a hierarchical clustering scenario is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the method combines the picture of the spherical infall model and a modification of the extended press - schechter theory . </S>",
    "<S> the mass accretion rate of a halo is defined to be the rate of its mass increase due to minor mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the accreted mass is deposited at the outer shells without changing the density profile of the halo inside its current virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the method to a flat @xmath0 universe . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting density profiles are compared to analytical models proposed in the literature , and a very good agreement is found . </S>",
    "<S> a trend is found of the inner density profile becoming steeper for larger halo mass , that also results from recent n - body simulations . additionally , present - day concentrations as well as their time evolution are derived and it is shown that they reproduce the results of large cosmological n - body simulations .    </S>",
