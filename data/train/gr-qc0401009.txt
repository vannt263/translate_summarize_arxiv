    "in classical general relativity , singularities are not part of the spacetime ; they are boundary points indicated by incomplete geodesics or incomplete curves of bounded acceleration in a maximal spacetime ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so at least for timelike and null geodesics , this incompleteness can be considered as the abrupt ending of classical particle paths .    what happens if , instead of classical particles , one uses quantum mechanical particles to identify singularities ?",
    "this is the question g. horowitz and d. marolf @xcite set out to answer following earlier work by r. wald @xcite .",
    "they call a spacetime quantum mechanically nonsingular if the evolution of a test scalar wave packet in the spacetime , representing a quantum mechanical particle , is uniquely determined by the initial wave packet , without having to place arbitrary boundary conditions at the classical singularity .",
    "their construction is restricted to static spacetimes .",
    "mathematically , this evolution is related to properties of a quantum mechanical operator .",
    "a static spacetime is quantum mechanically singular @xcite if the spatial portion of the klein - gordon wave operator is not essentially self - adjoint @xcite @xcite .",
    "if this operator is not essentially self - adjoint then the evolution of a test scalar wave packet is not determined uniquely by the initial wave packet ; boundary conditions at the classical singularity are needed to `` pick out '' the correct wave function and thus one needs to add information that is not already present in the wave operator , spacetime metric , and manifold . this will be described further in the paragraphs below .",
    "horowitz and marolf restrict the wave operator to the klein - gordon operator , but it has been shown @xcite that maxwell and dirac operators may also be used with equivalent generic results . throughout this paper",
    "we will restrict the analysis to klein - gordon operators .",
    "a relativistic quantum particle with mass @xmath0 can be described by a positive frequency solution to the klein - gordon equation    @xmath1    in a static spacetime @xcite .",
    "the spatial klein - gordon operator @xmath2 is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 ( here @xmath5 is the timelike killing field ) and @xmath6 is the spatial covariant derivative on the static slice @xmath7 .",
    "the appropriate hilbert space @xmath8 is @xmath9 , the space of square integrable functions on @xmath7 .",
    "this choice agrees with that of horowitz and marolf @xcite .",
    "the volume element used to define @xmath8 is @xmath10 times the natural volume element on @xmath7 .",
    "we do not choose the first sobolev norm @xmath11 proposed by ishibashi and hosoya @xcite ; that choice is related to dirichlet boundary conditions at the singularity @xcite . if we initially define the domain of @xmath2 to be @xmath12 , @xmath2 is a real positive symmetric operator and self - adjoint extensions always exist @xcite . if there is one unique self - adjoint extension @xmath13 , then @xmath2 is essentially self - adjoint @xcite . in this case",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a free relativistic particle takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath14    with    @xmath15    equations ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) are ambiguous if @xmath2 is not essentially self - adjoint .",
    "this fact led horowitz and marolf @xcite to define quantum - mechanically singular spacetimes as those in which @xmath2 is not essentially self - adjoint .    in their paper horowitz and marolf test several classically singular spacetimes to determine whether they are quantum mechanically singular as well .",
    "they find that reissner - nordstrm , negative mass schwarzschild , and the @xmath16 cone remain singular when probed by quantum scalar test particles ; however , certain orbifolds , extreme kaluza - klein black holes , the @xmath17 fundamental string , and a few other examples are nonsingular",
    ". helliwell and konkowski @xcite and helliwell , konkowski and arndt @xcite show that a broad class of quasiregular spacetimes ( spacetimes with quasiregular singularities ) are quantum mechanically singular .",
    "this work was an extension of earlier work by kay and studer @xcite which showed that the @xmath16 cone and a @xmath18 idealized cosmic string are not essentially self - adjoint .",
    "the work of horowitz and marolf @xcite and subsequent work by helliwell , konkowski and arndt @xcite test for essential self - adjointness of the spatial operator @xmath2 by using a von neumann criterion @xcite .",
    "this method involves studying solutions to    @xmath19    and finding the number of solutions that belong to @xmath9 for each sign of @xmath20 .",
    "this determines the von neumann deficiency indices which indicate whether the operator is essentially self - adjoint or whether it has self - adjoint extensions , and how many self - adjoint extensions it has . if the deficiency indices are @xmath21 , so that no solutions are square integrable , then the operator is essentially self - adjoint and so has a unique self - adjoint extension .",
    "the wave behavior described by the operator is uniquely determined for all time by the operator , the spacetime metric , and the manifold .",
    "no additional information in the form of boundary conditions need be added .    in this paper",
    "we use an alternative test for quantum singularity based upon the limit point - limit circle criterion for essential self - adjointness of operators .",
    "that is , we use a theorem of weyl s @xcite to relate the essential self - adjointness of the operator via the von neumann deficiency indices to the `` potential '' which determines the behavior of the scalar wave packet .",
    "the effect is determined by the limit point - limit circle criterion which we will discuss in section 3 . after developing this technique in the context of determining the quantum singularity nature of a general spacetime , we study the so - called levi - civita spacetimes in particular .",
    "levi - civita spacetimes are static , primarily cylindrically symmetric , spacetimes that are classically singular at `` @xmath22 '' unless the metric is minkowski or minkowski in accelerated coordinates .",
    "they are used to model infinite line masses and idealized cosmic strings .",
    "there has been some controversy in the literature about the physical relevance of certain parameters ; this will be reviewed in section 2 .",
    "the quantum singularity or nonsingularity of @xmath22 will be studied in section 4 ( following the mathematical background in section 3 ) . finally in section 5",
    "we use the quantum singularity results for certain parameter values to glean what information we can about the physical interpretation of the corresponding spacetimes .",
    "the metric in levi - civita spacetimes @xcite has the form    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real numbers ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath27 in the metric , the spacetime is unchanged , although a coordinate transformation is required to make this obvious .",
    "therefore we need only study the range @xmath28 .",
    "neither of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be removed by a coordinate transformation @xcite .",
    "computation of the kretschmann scalar    @xmath29    shows that @xmath22 is a scalar curvature singularity for all @xmath30 except @xmath31 .    if @xmath32 , the metric is    @xmath33    if @xmath34 , this is simply minkowski spacetime in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to choose the coordinate ranges    @xmath35    with @xmath36 and @xmath37 identified . if @xmath38 , equation [ eq:8 ] is the metric for an idealized cosmic string .",
    "there is a quasiregular ( `` disclination '' ) singularity at @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "this is a topological singularity , not a curvature singularity .",
    "it is thus reasonable to identify the parameter @xmath25 in the general metric , equation ( 6 ) , with a topological property of the spacetime , that is , the deficit angle .    the sigma parameter is less easily interpreted @xcite . for certain values",
    "one can interpret these spacetimes as those of infinite line masses .",
    "this interpretation is clearest for @xmath39 .",
    "the most physically realistic range is @xmath40 , where @xmath24 represents the mass per unit length and timelike circular orbits exist .",
    "as @xmath24 increases from 1/4 to 1/2 the interpretation is more difficult @xcite . in this range ,",
    "the kretschmann scalar decreases with increasing @xmath24 , which seems to suggest that the gravitational field is becoming weaker .",
    "but as several authors comment @xcite , the kretschmann scalar may not be a good indicator of gravitational strength ; the acceleration of test particles , increasing with increasing @xmath24 in the interval @xmath41 , may be a better indicator .",
    "interior solutions matching to exterior levi - civita spacetimes exist for the entire range @xmath42 .",
    "bonnor @xcite proposes to interpret levi - civita as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with increasing @xmath24 and tends to infinity as @xmath24 tends to @xmath43 .",
    "thus the entire range @xmath42 can be taken to represent an `` infinite line mass '' .",
    "the @xmath44 case is more problematic .",
    "bonnor s analysis suggests ( but does not prove ) that when @xmath44 the cylinder becomes a plane , an interpretation first put forward by gautreau and hoffmann @xcite based on different considerations .",
    "in fact , the @xmath45 metric    @xmath46    is flat .",
    "we can transform to minkowski coordinates    @xmath47    if we let @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . here",
    "we can obviously let the @xmath52 coordinate range from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "this is flat spacetime described from the view of an accelerating frame of reference .",
    "this seems to support the interpretation of the @xmath44 case as a planar source producing flat spacetime described by a uniformly accelerating observer @xcite . in other words",
    ", one can interpret it as the spacetime of a gravitational field produced by an infinite planar sheet of positive mass density .    on the other hand",
    ", one can interpret the metric with @xmath55 as the gravitational field produced by an infinite sheet of negative mass density ( an idea also first proposed by gautreau and hoffmann @xcite ) .",
    "however , this case is also problematic @xcite .",
    "the metric    @xmath56    is not flat and it has a curvature singularity at @xmath22 .",
    "it has planar symmetry with one additional extra killing vector beyond those in the general levi - civita spacetimes .",
    "the interpretation of this spacetime as one caused by an infinite plane of negative mass density comes from the fact that test particles are repelled from the @xmath22 plane and the fact that `` the gaussian curvature of spacelike ` eigensurfaces ' is zero '' @xcite .",
    "this is a reasonable interpretation ; the `` problem '' comes from interpreting both @xmath44 and @xmath57 as planes of infinite ( positive / negative ) mass density as one is singularity - free and the other has a curvature singularity @xcite .",
    "we will now study the quantum singularity properties of these spacetimes for various parameter values in the following sections .",
    "we begin by introducing the mathematics necessary to discuss essentially self - adjoint operators and quantum singularities .",
    "a particularly convenient way to establish essential self - adjointness in the spatial operator of the klein - gordon equation is to use the concepts of limit circle and limit point behavior .",
    "the approach is as follows .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for levi - civita spacetimes can be separated in the coordinates @xmath58 .",
    "only the radial equation is non - trivial . with changes in both dependent and independent variables ,",
    "the radial equation can be written as a one - dimensional schrdinger equation    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and the operator @xmath61 .",
    "the potential @xmath62 is in the limit circle case at @xmath63 if for some , and therefore for all @xmath64 , _ all _ solutions of equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) are square integrable at zero .",
    "if @xmath62 is not in the limit circle case , it is in the limit point case .",
    "a similar definition pertains to @xmath65 .",
    "the potential @xmath62 is in the limit circle case at @xmath65 if all solutions of equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) are square integrable at infinity ; otherwise , @xmath62 is in the limit point case at infinity .",
    "there are of course two linearly independent solutions of the schrdinger equation for given @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath62 is in the limit circle case at zero , both solutions are @xmath66 at zero , so all linear combinations are @xmath66 as well .",
    "we would therefore need a boundary condition at @xmath67 to establish a unique solution .",
    "if @xmath62 is in the limit _ point _ case , the @xmath66 requirement eliminates one of the solutions , leaving a unique solution without the need of establishing a boundary condition at @xmath67 .",
    "this is the whole idea of testing for quantum singularities ; there is no singularity if the solution is unique , as it is in the limit point case .",
    "the critical theorem is due to weyl @xcite .",
    "if @xmath62 is a continuous real - valued function on @xmath68 , then @xmath69 is essentially self - adjoint on @xmath70 if and only if @xmath62 is in the limit point case at both zero and infinity .",

    "in the preceding section we showed that the klein - gordon operator is limit point at infinity for the whole class of levi - civita spacetimes . if @xmath24 is neither zero nor one - half , the klein - gordon operator is limit circle at @xmath124 and thus not essentially self - adjoint , so all @xmath140 levi - civita spacetimes are quantum mechanically singular as well as being classically singular .    if @xmath32 and @xmath141 , the spacetime is simply minkowski space .",

    ". if arbitrary values of @xmath143 are allowed , these spacetimes are quantum mechanically singular in agreement with earlier results @xcite .",
    "recall that these spacetimes are also classically singular with a quasiregular ( `` disclination '' ) singularity at @xmath22 .    if @xmath44 the classical spacetime is flat and without a classical singularity .",
    "we have shown that this spacetime is quantum mechanically nonsingular as well for massive scalar particles obeying the klein - gordon equation , since the operator is limit point at both ends and thus essentially self - adjoint .",
    "thus for the levi - civita spacetimes , all that are classically singular are also quantum mechanically singular , and all that are classically nonsingular ( @xmath118 , and @xmath44 ) are also quantum mechanically nonsingular .",
    "the classically and quantum - mechanically nonsingular spacetimes correspond to isolated values of @xmath24 , so that ( for example ) even though the spacetime @xmath118 is nonsingular , the spacetimes with @xmath144 are singular .",
    "the only discrepency between classical and quantum singularities are for the @xmath145 modes with @xmath117 , which are quantum mechanically nonsingular in a classically singular spacetime .",
    "the physical reason is that the wavefunction for large values of @xmath143 in a flat space with a quasiregular singularity at @xmath22 are unable to detect the presence of the singularity because of the repulsive centrifugal potential @xmath146 in equation ( 21 ) .",
    "the limit point / limit circle criterion , together with the theorems that connect it to the effective potential in a schrodinger equation , provide physical insight into when quantum singularities are prevented from occurring by potential barriers .",
