    "in preparing a quantum system in a known pure state , one often starts with a mixed state , either because noise processes have rendered the initial state unknown , or because the system is entangled with other quantum systems . as a result ,",
    "state - preparation requires the use of both measurement and unitary operations ( hamiltonian evolution ) .",
    "the measurement provides the required purification , and the unitary evolution the ability to pick a particular final state .    however , it turns out that for continuous measurements there exists a nontrivial interplay between the measurement process and unitary operations : the latter , if applied during the measurement , change the rate at which the system is purified  @xcite .",
    "thus , a process of _ hamiltonian feedback _ ( that is , unitary operations performed conditionally upon the continuous output of the measurement process ) plays the role not only of picking the appropriate final state , but also of determining the speed of projection , and thus ultimately of preparation .",
    "note that while measurements are often treated as being instantaneous , all real measurements are continuous in that they take some time to act ; measurements may be treated as instantaneous only if the measurement time - scale is much shorter than all other time - scales relevant to the given problem .",
    "the problem we consider here is the preparation of a single qubit in the fastest time .",
    "this is a particular instance of a problem in the domain of quantum feedback control  @xcite , and like all such problems it only makes sense when some or all of the resources at the disposal of the controller are finite .",
    "thus we will be interested in the optimal speed of preparation given finite rates of measurement and/or hamiltonian evolution .",
    "we will find that even this simple task of preparing a single qubit , employing the most straightforward measurement process , has a non - trivial structure .    while the dynamics of closed quantum systems is linear , that of observed quantum systems is often non - linear .",
    "the problem of feedback control of quantum systems is therefore generally non - linear ( even for very simple systems ) , and our preparation problem is no exception .",
    "few analytic results exist for optimal control algorithms for non - linear systems .",
    "however , the tractability of the problem depends not only upon the dynamics of the system , but also the nature of the resource restrictions and how they are applied .    one method of enforcing resource restrictions is simply to fix the maximal resources allowed , and to optimize the desired behavior of the algorithm under this restriction . in this case",
    "the functional to optimize is merely a function of the system dynamics under the action of the feedback .",
    "an alternative procedure is to make the resources flexible , and to minimize a ` cost ' function which contains both a contribution from the amount of feedback required , and the resulting system dynamics . in this case ` optimality ' means optimality with respect to both the amount of resources used , and the resulting dynamics .",
    "the relative weighting between the cost of control and the cost of undesired dynamics is a free parameter .    while the second of the above approaches is usually unsolvable for non - linear systems , a solution is often clear for the first if the constraint is merely on the strength of the applied feedback ( the size of the applied force ) .",
    "that is , when one assumes that the rate at which this force can be changed is effectively unlimited on the relevant time scales of the system .",
    "the resulting algorithms are such that at any particular time the applied force is set at its extreme value in one direction or the other ( for a one dimensional problem ) .",
    "the resulting feedback algorithms are referred to as ` bang - bang ' control , a term that presumably originates from the sound that a mechanical controller makes when switching backwards and forwards between two extreme values .",
    "one can view our problem as consisting of a set of control problems corresponding to increasingly realistic resource constraints .",
    "we will find that when the strength of the measurement is fixed and the hamiltonian is unlimited , the optimal algorithm may be found analytically , as well as its performance . when we next impose a limitation on the strength of the feedback hamiltonian ( but nothing else ) ,",
    "there are broadly speaking two problems : one in which the measurement basis is free to vary and the second in which it is fixed .",
    "for the former the optimal bang - bang algorithm is easily obtained , but its performance must be calculated numerically . for the latter it is only possible to derive the overall structure of the algorithm .",
    "both the quantitative details and performance must be calculated numerically .    in section  [ rapidproj ]",
    "we introduce continuous measurement and analyze rapid projection via feedback . following reference",
    "@xcite we derive the optimal algorithm under the assumption of unlimited hamiltonian resources , and its performance .",
    "the latter may be regarded as an an upper bound on all algorithms possible with a finite hamiltonian . in section  [ flex ]",
    "we consider rapid state preparation with finite hamiltonian resources . in the first part we consider the case in which the measurement basis is under our control ,",
    "derive the optimal algorithm and calculate numerically its perform as a function of the magnitude of the hamiltonian .",
    "this allows us to see how large a hamiltonian is required to approach the upper bound in the previous section .",
    "in the second part we examine the case in which the measurement basis is fixed ( and corresponds to the preparation basis ) , and describe the structure of the optimal bang - bang algorithm .    before we begin",
    "we note that recently there have appeared two related works by van handel , stockton and mabuchi  @xcite which consider the deterministic preparation of one of the eigenstates of a continuously measured observable by using feedback during the measurement .",
    "there are also a number of articles which are concerned more generally with the feedback control of two - state quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "all physical measurements are continuous - that is , every measurement extracts information at a finite rate .",
    "when this rate is much larger than all other relevant time - scales , then one can approximate the measurement by a von neumann measurement .",
    "otherwise one must describe the continuous extraction of information explicitly . to describe a continuous measurement classically",
    ", one simply writes down the relationship of the measurement results , @xmath0 ( which are a function of time ) , to the true value of the measured quantity , @xmath1 , which is also in general a function of time . for virtually all applications in which the stream of output results is a continuous function of time ,",
    "this relationship is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some constant , and @xmath4 is an increment of the gaussian noise process referred to as the wiener process .",
    "( for readers not familiar with the wiener process , we note that easily accessible treatments may be found in references  @xcite and  @xcite . )",
    "gaussian noise is appropriate for virtually all continuous measurements in which @xmath0 a continuous function because of the central limit theorem .",
    "it turns out that the measurement record @xmath5 may also be written in terms of the expectation value of @xmath6 at each time .",
    "specifically @xmath7 where @xmath8 is another zero - mean wiener process ( gaussian white noise ) , uncorrelated with @xmath4 .",
    "one then uses bayes theorem  @xcite to obtain an equation which gives the evolution of the observer s state - of - knowledge regarding @xmath1 ( that is , her probability density for @xmath1 ) as the measurement progresses .",
    "this equation is called the kushner - stratonovich equation  @xcite , and for a @xmath6 which does not change with time , is given by @xmath9 where we have chosen @xmath10 to simplify the treatment in what follows . the quantity",
    "@xmath11 characterizes the rate at which the measurement extracts information about @xmath6 , and we will refer to it as the _ measurement strength_.    quantum mechanically , one can describe a continuous measurement by using a sequence of `` weak '' measurements , where one takes the continuum limit of an infinite number of infinitely weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "in doing so , one obtains the precise quantum equivalent of the classical continuous measurement given by eqs .",
    "( [ rec ] ) and ( [ ks ] ) . in the quantum case the observer s state - of - knowledge",
    "is given by the density matrix .",
    "if the measurement extracts information about an observable @xmath12 , then the quantum equivalent of the kushner - stratonovich equation is @xmath13 dt + \\sqrt{2k}(\\hat{y}\\rho + \\rho\\hat{y }                                           - 2\\langle \\hat{y } \\rangle \\rho ) dw .",
    "\\label{gensme}\\ ] ] this equation is referred to as a _ stochastic master equation _ (",
    "if @xmath12 commutes with the initial density matrix , then this quantum equation reduces to the classical equation ( eq.([ks ] ) ) , because quantum measurement theory reduces to classical measurement theory ( as it must ) when all relevant quantities commute  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is simply the diagonal of @xmath15 .",
    "let us consider now a continuous measurement of the @xmath16-component of spin of a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "the sme for this measurement is given by setting @xmath17 in eq.([gensme ] ) above .",
    "if we write the density matrix in terms of the bloch vector , @xmath18 , as @xmath19 then the sme becomes @xmath20 from these it is easy to show that the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a constant of the motion , and thus the initial angle of the bloch vector in the @xmath23-@xmath6 plane , @xmath24 , remains unchanged throughout the measurement .",
    "we can thus reduce the equations of motion to two variables .",
    "if we define @xmath25 , being the length of the projection of the bloch vector in the @xmath23-@xmath6 plane , then the equations of motion become @xmath26 due to symmetry the angle @xmath27 plays no role in the dynamics .",
    "the purity of the density matrix , @xmath28 $ ] , being the squared length of the bloch vector , characterizes the observers certainty regarding which pure state the system is in .",
    "if the observer has no information regarding the state of the system , this corresponds to a uniform distribution over all pure states ( or , alternatively , equal probabilities for the two eigenstates of @xmath29 ) . in this case",
    "the density matrix is described as being `` completely mixed '' , and is proportional to the identity matrix . in this case",
    "the purity is minimal .",
    "if , on the other hand , the observer knows the system to be in a specific pure state , then the purity obtains its maximal value of unity . to measure the observers uncertainty we will use @xmath30 $ ] , and refer to this as the _ impurity _ ( the `` bar '' is intended to represent negation ) .",
    "this quantity is often referred to as the _ linear entropy_. in terms of the dynamical variables introduced above , the impurity is @xmath31 = \\frac{1}{2 } ( 1 - \\delta^2 - a_z^2 ) .\\ ] ]    if the state of the system is initially completely mixed ( completely uncertain ) , then @xmath32 .",
    "while in this case @xmath33 remains zero throughout the measurement , @xmath34 is stochastically driven to @xmath35 .",
    "that is , the state is projected onto one of the eigenstates of @xmath29 , which is the result of the measurement , and in this case each of these outcomes is selected with equal probability . in this case",
    "the measurement is also purely classical , since @xmath33 is always zero , which means that the density matrix , @xmath36 , commutes with @xmath29 at all times .    the stochastic equations which describe the measurement process ( eqs.([smeaz ] ) and ( [ smed ] ) ) are non - linear .",
    "however , it is nevertheless possible to solve these equations by using an equivalent formulation ( referred to as a `` linear quantum trajectory '' ) in which they become linear  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the solution is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a random variable , whose probability density is @xmath39 using this solution we can obtain an expression for the average impurity as the measurement proceeds .",
    "this is @xmath40 while this integral must be solved numerically , certain features may nevertheless be extracted from this expression for @xmath41 .",
    "one finds that initially @xmath41 decays as an exponential at rate @xmath42 , and an approximate analytic expression may be derived in the long - time limit , to which we will return later .",
    "in addition , general properties of measurement make it clear that @xmath41 decays monotonically with time  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the qualitative form of the optimal bang - bang algorithm which results from the above reasoning is displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] ( for the case in which the measurement is in the @xmath29 basis , and the target state is @xmath43 ) .",
    "the algorithm involves choosing the hamiltonian so as to rotate the state towards the @xmath23-@xmath6 plane ( @xmath44 ) , until a critical line is reached ( the dotted lines in figure  [ fig3 ] - there are two due to symmetry ) .",
    "these lines start at the @xmath23-@xmath6 plane , and become closer to the edge of the bloch ball as they move towards the target state , reaching the target purity at that point .",
    "once the state of the system crosses these lines , the hamiltonian is reversed so as to rotate towards the target .",
    "how might one go about calculating the exact form for the critical lines in figure  [ fig3 ] ?",
    "the time taken to reach the target is ultimately a functional of the critical line .",
    "one could therefore simulate the feedback algorithm to obtain the average time - to - target , and seek to optimize this by varying the critical line .",
    "in implementing such a procedure one would ideally start with a guess for the critical curve based on approximate arguments .",
    "even so , one would expect this method to require considerable numerical resources .",
    "the position of the critical line is determined by the average time required to reach the target purity from any given point . however , this average time is itself a function of the feedback algorithm , and thus the positioning of the critical line - wherein lies the difficulty .",
    "it might be possible to obtain an approximate solution using a numerical algorithm which discretizes the angle to the target , and considers small angles first .",
    "that is , calculates the remaining purification time at a small angle from the target , assuming that feedback at all larger angles involves rotating towards the target , and then once this is determined works backwards to larger angles .",
    "however , it is not clear that such an algorithm would reduce the numerical resource requirements . in any case ,",
    "the task of obtaining the precise form of the optimal feedback algorithm remains an open problem for future work .",
    "we have seen that the rate at which a quantum state is purified by a continuous measurement is not isotropic on the bloch sphere ; it depends on the angle between the state and the measurement basis .",
    "this curious fact means that the task of rapid state preparation using feedback control is non - trivial .",
    "it is possible to derive the optimal bang - bang algorithm for purification in a special case in which one is free to choose the measurement basis , but it is not clear that a fully analytic solution will exist for the general case . nevertheless , it is possible to describe the qualitative structure of the algorithm for the general case , and this algorithm does not involve taking the shortest path to the target state .",
