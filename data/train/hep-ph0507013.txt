    "the unexpected discovery , by bunce et al . in 1976",
    "@xcite , of large @xmath1 polarization in the inclusive production , induced by proton - beryllium collisions at 200 gev , opened an interesting field of investigation .",
    "earlier experimental data , as those on the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions @xcite , indicated that in general the polarization decreased with the energy and , moreover , theoretically it was hard to believe that high - energy inclusive reactions could produce significant polarization , because it was expected that a large cancellation occurred when many uncorrelated channels are superposed .    in the following years",
    "many proton - nucleus collision experiments have been performed and these experiments confirmed the @xmath1 polarization , in the @xmath5 range of 0 - 2 gev @xcite .",
    "they also showed that in the same domain the @xmath6 polarization is very small , consistent with 0 .",
    "this fact created the false idea that only the hyperons could be polarized and the antihyperons not . in 1981 , wilkinson and his collaborators measured for the first time the polarization of a charged hyperon , @xmath7 @xcite , and found to be positive . in 1983 @xcite , the @xmath8 polarization was measured , with results consistent with the @xmath7 ones , and in 1986 , the @xmath9 polarization was observed , and it was found to be negative @xcite .",
    "more recently , polarizations of hyperons produced with a @xmath8 beam also have been measured @xcite .",
    "soon it was possible to obtain polarizations of other hyperons : in 1990 the @xmath10 was measured @xcite , negative , and in 1993 morelos and his collaborators measured the @xmath11 polarization @xcite that is positive .",
    "these results showed that , refuting the earlier belief , the antihyperon polarizations are not always zero .",
    "many models have been proposed trying to explain these experimental results , such as the lund model @xcite , the quark recombination model @xcite , and the oper ( reggeized one pion exchange ) @xcite , that explained the @xmath1 polarization but were not able to calculate the @xmath6 polarization .",
    "these models are based on the leading - particle effect , that means that the observed hyperon is considered as a direct product of the incoming proton after a recombination .",
    "clearly , this mechanism can be effective only for hyperons but not for anti - hyperons .",
    "later , models based on constituent quarks @xcite and others @xcite,@xcite were proposed , but a satisfactory explanation for the antihyperon polarization was not achieved . as we can see , the models are able to explain the @xmath1 polarization ( and even @xmath6 ) , but in fact , all of the models predict the production of unpolarized antihyperons and this fact shows that these models must be supplemented in order to describe also the antihyperon data .",
    "it is well known that final - state interactions are fundamental in the study of the nonleptonic hyperon decays , where the final - state strong phases must be considered @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in high - energy inclusive processes , a large number of particles is produced , so we expect that something similar occur in this kind of reactions . in 1993 ,",
    "y. hama and t. kodama @xcite used the hydrodynamical model to study the effect of final - state interactions of the produced ( anti ) hyperons with the background matter .",
    "it was supposed that the ( anti ) hyperons are produced inside a medium composed of hot hadronic matter , that is formed during the collision , and the polarization is the result of the interaction of the hyperon with the surrounding matter . in @xcite ,",
    "this interaction was represented by an optical potential and they showed that this mechanism could produce polarized hyperons and antihyperons",
    ". however , some important questions remained opened , namely , the origin of the potentials and why different potentials are needed for the different ( anti ) hyperons .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve the model described in the preceding paragraph , by explicitly including some detailed microscopic interaction between the antihyperon and the surrounding thermalized medium @xcite . considering that in this kind of collisions pions are predominant among the produced particles , as a first approximation",
    ", we will include only the pion - antihyperon interactions in the study .",
    "the observed polarization is the average effect of these interactions .",
    "an important feature is that as the antihyperons and pions are in thermal equilibrium inside this fluid , the energy involved in the microscopic interactions is generally low . also , since the hyperons are produced mostly as the leading particles , we shall confine ourselves only to antihyperon polarization .",
    "a crucial factor to the polarization mechanism is the shape of the fluid rapidity distribution , @xmath12 , at the moment of emission .",
    "if @xmath12 were constant , no polarization would be expected because , for antihyperons with rapidity @xmath13 , the contributions coming from the @xmath14 region would cancel out the ones from the @xmath15 domain , as they have opposite signs .",
    "but in the relevant @xmath16 domain for the experimentally produced antihyperons , @xmath12 is decreasing , and then , the average polarization is dominated by the contributions from @xmath15 .",
    "another remark is that , since we are interested in antihyperons which are escaping , the microscopic collisions is essentially in the forward direction .",
    "the content of this work is the following . in the next section ,",
    "the previously developed low energy pion - hyperon interactions @xcite , based on chiral lagrangians , are shortly reported . in sec .",
    "iii these results are used to calculate the polarizations in high - energy inclusive processes . in sec .",
    "iv the results are shown and , finally , conclusions are drawn in sec",
    "in this section , the basic question to be answered is how to describe the low energy @xmath17 interactions in a reliable way .",
    "the path to be followed is to study the @xmath18 interactions and then to use the @xmath19 invariance ( neglecting the possible effects of @xmath20 violation ) to determine the amplitudes in the @xmath17 scattering .",
    "we will study the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 interactions , and then , the quantities of interest that are cross sections and polarizations , will be calculated .",
    "the @xmath24 polarization , for example , is just the @xmath25 one , with the opposite sign .",
    "the cross sections for charge conjugate reactions are the same .",
    "unfortunately , one must remark that this kind of interaction is not very well studied experimentally , the first measurement of phase shifts that has been made , was the difference @xmath26 in the @xmath27 interaction for @xmath28 , by the fermilab e756 experiment @xcite , and improved last year by the hypercp experiment @xcite , but still with reasonable experimental uncertainties .",
    "so , the option is to describe these interactions with a model .",
    "some models @xcite-@xcite have been proposed to study the @xmath29 phase shifts , but these values are not accurately determined yet . on the other hand ,",
    "the low energy @xmath30 interactions can be described with a high degree of accuracy , with models based on chiral symmetry @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , in this work we will use a model @xcite-@xcite which is based on effective chiral lagrangians , that considers baryons , spin 3/2 resonances , rho mesons and the @xmath31 term .",
    "an important feature of the model is the inclusion of resonances in the intermediate states . in the @xmath32 scattering ( 3/2 isospin channel )",
    "the @xmath33 dominates the total cross section at low energies and is also very important in the other isospin channels . in the @xmath18 case",
    ", we expect that the same behavior occurs .",
    "the lagrangians to be considered are @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the baryon , the spin 3/2 resonance , the pion and the rho fields with masses @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively , @xmath43 is the baryon magnetic moment , @xmath44 are the isospin matrices and @xmath45 is a parameter representing the possibility of the off - shell - resonance having spin 1/2 .",
    "the first case to be considered is the the @xmath29 interaction .",
    "since @xmath1 has isospin 0 , the scattering amplitude @xmath46 has the general form t_^ba= ( ) a + ( k + k)2b_ba u(p )    ,    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the initial and final 4-momenta of @xmath1 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are those of the pion .",
    "indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 indicate the initial and final isospin states of the pion . fig .",
    "1 shows the relevant diagrams , where we have omitted the crossed diagrams , although included in the calculations . to calculate the diagrams from fig . 1",
    ", we must use the lagrangians ( [ lbb ] ) and ( [ lbr ] ) , that in this case are    @xmath53    = 8.cm    calculating the contribution from fig .",
    "1a ( intermediate @xmath54 ) , we have @xmath55    the interaction with the intermediate resonance @xmath56 , shown in fig .",
    "1b , is @xmath57    with @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are defined in the appendix a. note that eq.([3.2 ] ) shows small differences when compared with the one shown in @xcite , where there was a mistake .",
    "the correct expression is presented here .",
    "in addition to these contributions , the @xmath61 term ( fig .",
    "1c ) was also taken into account . in @xcite , @xcite , in the study of @xmath30 interactions , it was included just as a parametrization @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants .",
    "recent works @xcite , @xcite consider that the @xmath61 term may be understood in terms of the exchange of two pions , in loop diagrams , as it is shown in fig 2 .",
    "so , these ideas lead to a @xmath61 contribution of the form a_&=&_+_^ * + b_&=&0    ,    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "one must remark that considering the diagrams of fig .",
    "1 , the resulting amplitude will be real and consequently the @xmath67 matrix will not be unitary .",
    "so , the unitarization of the amplitudes must be done . observing that the scattering matrix may be expressed as m_ba==f_1+f_2",
    "the partial wave decomposition can be made with a_l=_-1 ^ 1[p_l(x)f_1(x)+p_l1(x)f_2(x ) ]  ,    and the unitarization of these amplitudes , can be made if we reinterpret them as elements of @xmath68 matrix and write    a_l^u=  .",
    "the phase - shifts are then computed as _",
    "l = tg^-1(k  a_l )  ,    and details on this calculation are shown in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the masses and magnetic moments that we used may be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath69 coupling constant is @xmath70=12.92 ( see appendix a ) . the resonance coupling constants were calculated with the comparison of the calculated amplitude and the breit - wigner one , with the data from @xcite as it was done in @xcite .",
    "the same procedure was adopted to calculate the other @xmath71 couplings .",
    "the obtained value is @xmath72 is 9.38 @xmath73 . with these results",
    ", we can calculate @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , that will be needed in the next section .",
    "= 8.cm    observing fig .",
    "[ stl ] , one can see a peak in the @xmath77 mass , what shows that the resonance dominates the total cross section at low energies .",
    "in the case of @xmath78 interaction , the particles have isospin 1 , so the composed system can have isospin 2,1 or 0 . for this reason , the scattering amplitude in this case has the general form @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are isospin indices of the particles .",
    "the diagrams that we consider for the @xmath78 interactions are shown in fig .",
    "the interactions with the intermediate resonance @xmath77 could also be included , but its decay branching ratio to the @xmath78 channel is only 11% , what may be considered as a correction , and then we will neglect it .",

    "the resonance , that in this case is @xmath86 , is still important , but now , the peak is not so high than it is in the other cases ( less than 30 mb ) .",

    "now , let us turn our attention to the @xmath23 interaction .",
    "this case is very similar to the @xmath87 scattering , because @xmath88 has isospin 1/2 ( as the nucleon ) and the main difference is that the resonance of interest @xmath89 has isospin @xmath90=1/2 ( instead of @xmath90=3/2 as @xmath91 ) .",

    "[ xst ] , we can see that one more time the resonance is very important , now the @xmath96 resonance contribution dominates three of the reactions .",
    "so , now we have the @xmath27 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 scattering amplitudes , that are the basic elements to calculate the polarization in high - energy processes .",
    "in this section , it will be shown how to calculate the @xmath24 polarization in high energy processes .",
    "as it was said , we consider that during the collision , a system composed of expanding hot hadronic matter is formed .",

    "the values of these parameters depend on the participants of the collision ( proton , beryllium , ... ) and on their energies .",
