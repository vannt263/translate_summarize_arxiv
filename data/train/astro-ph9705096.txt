    "we have covered this region with a regular grid of adjacent circular fields , with a diameter of 32 arcmin each , corresponding to the field of view of the multifiber spectrograph optopus ( lund 1986 ) at the 3.6 m eso telescope .",
    "the total solid angle of the spectroscopic survey is 23.2 square degrees . in order to increase the overall completeness , in the last observing run we have used the mefos spectrograph ( felenbok et al .",

    "no redshift measurement could be obtained for the remaining 208 spectra .",
    "all the details about data reduction , number of objects and completeness of the sample are reported in paper i and paper iii .",

    "the galactic absorption is assumed to be negligible , because the strip is close to the south galactic pole ( fong et al .",
    "+ finally , we note that the median internal velocity error for our galaxies ( @xmath51 km / s ) is quite small compared to the survey depth , and therefore its effect on the calculation of absolute magnitudes can be neglected .",
    "since our database was selected in the blue  green band , k  corrections are needed to compute the luminosity function even for the moderate redshifts sampled by our galaxies ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the application of the functional forms of the k  correction as a function of redshift ( e.g. shanks et al . 1984 ) obviously requires the knowledge of the morphological type of each galaxy , which is not available for most of our galaxies .",

    "+ the decrease of @xmath50 for @xmath58 is essentially due to the fact that the expected fraction of early  type galaxies , which have a larger k  correction , becomes smaller at this redshift , while the fraction of bluer galaxies with smaller or almost zero k  correction increases .",

    "for most samples of field galaxies the luminosity function is well represented by a schechter ( 1976 ) form @xmath63 where @xmath10 and @xmath64 are parameters referring to the shape of the function and @xmath65 contains the information about the normalization ; these parameters have to be determined from the data .     +",
    "many different methods have been used in the past years to compute the parameters of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "recently , however , the sty method ( sandage et al . 1979 ) has been the most widely used , and it has been shown that it is unbiased with respect to density inhomogeneities ( see for instance efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 , bardelli et al .",
    "the basic idea of this method is to compute the estimator of the quantity @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the integral luminosity function . under the assumption that the shape of the luminosity function is not a function of position [ i.e. @xmath68 , the probability of seeing a galaxy of luminosity @xmath69 at redshift @xmath70 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the minimum luminosity observable at redshift @xmath70 in a magnitude  limited sample . + the best parameters @xmath10 and @xmath64 of the luminosity function",

    "+ the faint end steepening is almost completely due to galaxies with detectable emission lines . in fact , dividing the galaxies into two samples , i.e. galaxies with and without emission lines ( 1575 and 1767 galaxies respectively ) , we find very significant differences in their luminosity functions .",
    "note that , given the typical signal to noise ratio of our spectra , detection of a line implies an equivalent width larger than about 5  .",

    ", it does not affect the derived parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , but has to be taken into account when determining the luminosity function normalization ( see next section ) .",
    "on the other hand , the latter incompleteness ( @xmath161 ) is higher for fainter objects and is well described by : @xmath162 note that the maximum fraction of galaxies for which the spectra did not provide a useful @xmath56 determination is @xmath163 for the faintest galaxies of our survey ( @xmath164 ) , for which the corresponding weight @xmath165 $ ] is 1.08 .",

    "note , however , that this error estimate accounts only for the part due to galaxy clustering and does not take into account the additional uncertainty arising from the errors on the parameters of the luminosity function . by varying @xmath10 and @xmath9 along their 1 @xmath134 confidence ellipse , we find that the errors on @xmath168 induced by the uncertainty on the parameters of the luminosity function are significantly larger ( @xmath180 ) than those due to galaxy clustering . therefore ,",
    "since there is no a priori reason to prefer the @xmath175 estimator with respect to other possible estimators , we have analyzed the behaviour of all the estimators discussed by dh82 .",
    "+ fig.5 shows the estimated average density as a function of the maximum distance for the four dh82 estimators : the values refer to galaxies with @xmath6 , in the case of a fit with a schechter function .",
    "the relative behaviour of the curves does not change with other choices for @xmath84 or for the case of the fit with a schechter function and a power law .",
    "the @xmath181 estimator produces a very stable value for the galaxy density for all comoving distances @xmath182 , even for distances larger than the maximum distance in the sample .",
    "the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the @xmath181 estimator for @xmath183 is of the order of @xmath184 , well below the @xmath185 uncertainty due to the errors on @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "all the other estimators appear to be much more sensitive to local fluctuations and vary significantly with the assumed maximum distance .",
    "for example , the density resulting from the @xmath175 estimator would change by @xmath186 by changing the maximum distance from @xmath187 , within which @xmath188 of our galaxies are contained , to @xmath189 , which corresponds to the maximum distance in the sample .",
    "since an optimal choice for the maximum distance to adopt in this analysis is not defined , this result shows an intrinsic ambiguity , at least for our sample , connected to the @xmath175 estimator . on the basis of this figure we therefore decided to adopt the @xmath181 estimator , which corresponds to a constant weighting function in eq.([eq : dh ] ) .",
    "the same estimator has been used in recent analyses of other redshift surveys , such as the lcrs ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) and the ssrs2 ( marzke & da costa 1997 ) . the errors on @xmath190 are computed applying the error propagation on eq.([eq : dh ] ) , taking into account also the uncertainties arising by varying @xmath10 and @xmath9 along their confidence ellipse .",
    "+ the derived densities need to be corrected for the redshift incompleteness of our survey : indeed , among the 4487 objects of the photometric catalogue , we have 208 failed spectra with low signal to noise ratio and 443 not observed objects ( see paper i and sect.4.4 ) .",
    "we assume that the failed spectra correspond to galaxies , because stars , being point ",
    "like objects , have on average a better signal to noise ratio than galaxies , and that the percentage of stars in not observed objects spectra is the same as in the spectroscopic sample ( i.e. @xmath191 ) .",
    "after subtracting the expected stellar contamination , we are left with about 600 not observed galaxies , corresponding to @xmath192 of the total .",
    "therefore the galaxy counts are multiplied by the factor 1.15 , before deriving the mean density .",
    "the use of a simple multiplicative factor implicitely assumes that the distance distribution of non observed galaxies is the same as that of the whole sample .",
    "this assumption is supported by the analysis of the magnitude distributions discussed in sect.4.3 .",
    "+ finally , from the estimated @xmath168 , it is possible to derive the normalization of the luminosity function as @xmath193 in the case of a single schechter function , and as @xmath194 in the case of schechter function and power law .",
    "the density radial profile of esp galaxies is shown in fig.6a as a function of comoving distance .",
    "in each distance bin the density has been computed using the @xmath181 estimator as discussed above ; the error bars represent @xmath132 poissonian uncertainties .",
    "the width of the various distance shells ( see horizontal lines in the figure ) has been chosen in order to have @xmath195 expected galaxies in each bin .",
    "the solid line represents the value of the global @xmath190 derived from the total sample ( see fig.5 ) and the dashed lines indicate the @xmath196 uncertainty on this value .",
    "the median of the @xmath190 values in the shells is @xmath197 , in excellent agreement with the global value @xmath198 .",
    "although the densities derived from most of the distance shells are within @xmath199 from the global mean density of the sample , at least three regions have densities which differ significantly ( @xmath200 a factor of two ) from the mean density .",
    "these regions ( two underdense regions at @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and an overdense region at @xmath203 ) are clearly visible also in fig.6b , which shows the observed distance histogram and the distribution expected for a uniform sample .",
    "the relatively large density fluctuations seen in our data are clearly due to the fact that our survey is a slice with a narrow width in one direction . note , however , that over  densities and under  densities of about a factor two are seen also in wider angle surveys , such as the ssrs2 ( marzke & da costa 1997 ) , the cfa2 ( marzke et al . 1994 ) and the lcrs ( lin et al . 1996 ) surveys .     + the results shown in this fig.6a refer to the case of a fit with a single schechter function for galaxies brighter than @xmath204 .",
    "qualitatively , the results for different limiting absolute magnitudes or for the case of the fit with a schechter function and a power law are similar to those shown in fig.6a , except for different normalizations .",
    "the galaxy number density for @xmath13 is well determined ( @xmath205 ) and is essentially independent from the adopted fitting law for the luminosity function .",
    "its estimate for @xmath15 is more uncertain , ranging from @xmath198 , in the case of a fit with a single schechter function , to @xmath206 , in the case of a fit with a schechter function and a power law .",

    "the @xmath10 and @xmath9 parameters derived from the ssrs2 survey ( marzke & da costa 1997 ) are in good agreement with our results . however , the amplitude of the ssrs2 luminosity function is such that the ratio between the ssrs2 and the esp luminosity functions is in the range @xmath247 for @xmath248 .",

    "+ ii ) the stromlo - apm ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) and the lcrs ( lin et al . 1996 ) luminosity functions are significantly different from the esp luminosity function in both shape ( both are flatter than the esp at low luminosity ) and amplitude ( both have a lower amplitude by a factor @xmath11 at @xmath12 ) . +",
    "while a possible explanation for the difference in amplitude with respect to the stromlo - apm luminosity function is presented later in this section , we are intrigued by the significant difference in amplitude with the lcrs luminosity function , which is derived from galaxies with a redshift distribution very similar to ours .",
    "the fact that the lcrs galaxies are selected in the red band can in principle explain , at least in part , their flatter luminosity function on the basis of the fact that at low luminosity most of the galaxies have emission lines ( see sect.4.2 above ) and are presumably bluer than the average .",
    "the dependence of the local luminosity function on color has been recently discussed by marzke & da costa ( 1997 ) , who indeed found a significantly steeper slope for blue galaxies with respect to the red ones in the ssrs2 .",
    "this , however , should not affect significantly the amplitude at @xmath12 .",
    "it is true that in the lcrs low surface brightness galaxies have been explicitly eliminated from the redshift survey , and therefore from the computation of the luminosity function , but the fraction of galaxies eliminated because of this selection effect is estimated to be less than @xmath249 ( lin et al .",
    "an other difference between the lcrs and the esp surveys is in the fraction of stars in the spectroscopic sample of candidate galaxies ( @xmath250 in lcrs and @xmath251 in esp ) .",
    "this can in principle be due to a better star ",
    "galaxy separation in the las campanas photometric data .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that a non negligible number of galaxies , probably the most compact ones , have been classified as stars in the las campanas data and therefore have not been observed spectroscopically . obviously , we have no way to check if something like this has really happened in the las campanas data .",
    "+ we have used our derived luminosity function to compute the expected galaxy counts in the case of a constant density and compared this prediction ( solid line in fig.8 ) with the data in our photometric catalogue ( solid circles with error bars in the same figure ) . note that in this magnitude range ( @xmath252 ) the counts predicted using the two different fits ( single schechter function or schechter function and power law ) are almost identical , while they differ significantly at magnitudes fainter than @xmath253 .",
    "+ it is clear from the figure that , while the counts predicted from the luminosity function are reasonably consistent with the data for @xmath254 , they are significantly higher at brighter magnitude . since our counts , although with large statistical errors because of the small area , are consistent with the global edsgc ( heydon  dumbleton et al .",
    "1989 ) counts and the apm counts are consistent with the edsgc ones ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) , this effect is essentially the same which has led maddox et al . (",
    "1990 ) to suggest rapid and dramatic evolution in the galaxy properties for @xmath255 .",
    "such a strong `` local '' evolution is not seen neither in our analysis of the luminosity function in three distance intervals ( see sect.4.2 ) nor in the deeper autofib redshift survey from which very little , if any , evolution is seen up to @xmath256 . + it has been suggested that the low apm counts at bright magnitude may be due to a magnitude scale error in the stromlo - apm galaxy survey ( metcalfe et al .",
    "the possible existence of such an error for the apm and similar catalogues is reinforced by the recent analysis of well calibrated schmidt plates digitized with the mama machine by bertin and dennefeld ( 1997 ) .",
    "we can not exclude a similar problem in our data , although the admittedly limited ccd photometry we have obtained on bright galaxies in this area ( garilli et al . in preparation ) does not show any strong magnitude error for galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath257 .",
    "+ at least for our data , however , an alternative or additional interpretation is suggested by fig.6 , which shows significant fluctuations around the mean density .",
    "the dashed line in fig.8 shows the expected counts computed by relaxing the assumption of constant density and allowing the normalization of the luminosity function to change with distance as indicated by the data points in fig.6 . in this way",
    "the agreement between the predicted and observed counts is more than acceptable over the entire magnitude range . in particular",
    ", the deficiency of the observed counts at bright magnitudes would be due to the `` local '' ( @xmath201 ) under  density . in this respect , it is interesting to note that , as mentioned above , the amplitude of the esp luminosity function is about a factor of two higher than the ssrs2 one , which has been derived from galaxies with @xmath258 over a much larger area , which includes the region of our survey .",
    "moreover , an under  density over a similar distance range is seen also in the south galactic cap part of the lcrs ( see fig.8a and 8c in lin et al .",
    "1996 ) . since the lcrs is based on galaxies extracted from a much larger area ( @xmath259 sq.deg . ) , over which our survey region is fully contained , we are led to conclude that the local under ",
    "density seen in our data may have a size of more than @xmath260 in at least the right ascension direction .",
    "if such an under  density extends with a similar size also in the declination direction , it could contribute significantly , possibly in addition to magnitude scale errors , to the low apm counts of bright galaxies .",
    "+ in this framework , the difference in amplitude between our luminosity function and the loveday et al .",
    "( 1992 ) luminosity function based on apm galaxies with @xmath261 could be at least partly explained by the presence of a real , giant under  density extending over a significant fraction of their survey . if we compute a luminosity function with our data but with the same limiting magnitude as in loveday et al .",
    ", the parameters we derive are fully consistent in both shape and amplitude with those derived by them .",
    "it has to be stressed , however , that the possibility for such an explanation has been considered by loveday et al . , but they did not find any evidence for it in their data ( see , for example , their fig.4 ) . +",
    "it is also interesting to note that , since a strong  local \" evolution is not easily accomodated in the standard evolutionary galaxy models , most models for the faint galaxy counts have often assumed a high normalization of the local luminosity function ( see for example guiderdoni & rocca  volmerange 1990 , pozzetti et al .",
    "we find that the normalization of our luminosity function is in good agreement with that usually assumed in these models and therefore our result gives an _ a posteriori _ confirmation of the somewhat _ ad hoc _ assumption adopted in these models .",
    "in this paper we have derived the luminosity function and the mean density from the esp galaxy redshift survey ; our main results are the following :    \\1 ) although a schechter function is an acceptable representation of the luminosity function over the entire range of magnitudes ( @xmath6 ) , our data suggest the presence of a steepening of the luminosity function for @xmath7 .",
    "such a steepening , well fitted by a power law with slope @xmath8 , is in agreement with what has been recently found by similar analyses for both field galaxies ( marzke et al .",
    "1994 ) and galaxies in clusters ( see for instance driver & phillipps 1996 ) .",
    "\\2 ) the steepening at the faint end of the luminosity function is almost completely due to galaxies with emission lines : in fact , dividing our galaxies into two samples , i.e. galaxies with and without emission lines , we find significant differences in their luminosity functions .",
    "in particular , galaxies with emission lines show a significantly steeper slope and a fainter @xmath9 . the volume density of galaxies with emission lines is lower than the volume density of galaxies without emission lines at bright magnitudes , but becomes higher at faint magnitudes .",
    "\\3 ) the amplitude and the @xmath10 and @xmath9 parameters of our luminosity function are in good agreement with those of the autofib redshift survey .",
    "viceversa , our amplitude is a factor @xmath11 higher , at @xmath262 , than that found for both the stromlo - apm and the las campanas redshift surveys .",
    "also the faint end slope of the luminosity function is significantly steeper for the esp galaxies than that found in these two surveys .",
    "\\4 ) we find evidence for a local under  density , extending up to a comoving distance @xmath263 .",
    "the volume probed by the esp within such a distance is smaller than the volume of a typical void with 50 diameter , and in principle this observed nearby under  density could be due to the specific direction of the survey piercing through a local void .",
    "our data do not allow to characterize this low density region in terms of size and shape .",
    "when the radial density variations observed in our data are taken into account , our derived luminosity function reproduces very well the observed counts for @xmath23 , including the steeper than euclidean slope for @xmath24 .",
    "if this under  density extends over a much larger solid angle than that covered by our survey , it could , at least partly , explain the low amplitude of the stromlo - apm luminosity function .",
    "\\5 ) a similar explanation can not justify the significant difference in amplitude between the esp and the lcrs luminosity functions , because the two samples cover essentially the same redshift range .",
    "one possibility , which has however to be verified , is that a non negligible number of galaxies are missing from the original ccd photometric catalog of the lcrs .    given the large number of galaxies , the high degree of completeness , the accurate selection criteria and the good photometry of the esp redshift survey , we can conclude that the results of our analysis give the best available estimate of both the normalization and the faint end slope of the luminosity function in the local universe .",
