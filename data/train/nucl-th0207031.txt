    "[ elastic ] . comparing",
    "the born cross section for the reaction @xmath144 with that from the coupled - channel approach shows that the coupled - channel effect increases its cross section significantly .",
    "another difference between the cross sections from the coupled - channel approach and those from the born approximation is that the former do not have as smooth an energy dependence as the latter .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the coupled - channel approach the coupling to a different channel in the intermediate states is enhanced whenever the energy is above its threshold .",
    "for example , in the reaction @xmath18 , which has the lowest total channel mass , effects of other channels such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 appears successively with increasing energy as shown in fig .",

    "<S> using a gauged flavor su(3 ) invariant hadronic lagrangian , we study @xmath0 production from @xmath1 induced reactions on @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a coupled - channel approach . including the four channels of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , we solve the bethe - salpeter equation in the @xmath8-matrix approximation by neglecting the off - shell contribution in the intermediate states . for the transition potential which drives the higher - order contribution , we consider all allowed born diagrams in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 channels . with coupling constants determined from the su(3 ) symmetry with empirical input , we find that the cross sections for the reactions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 all have values of a few mb . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the results from the lowest - order born approximation , the magnitude of these cross sections is less sensitive to the values of the cut - off parameters in the form factors . from the transition matrix in the coupled - channel approach </S>",
    "<S> , we have further evaluated the cross sections for the elastic process @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 as well as for the inelastic processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
