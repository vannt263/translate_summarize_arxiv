    "we consider the problem of an agent seeking to optimally invest in the presence of proportional transaction costs .",
    "the agent can invest in a stock , modeled as a geometric brownian motion with drift @xmath5 and volatility @xmath6 , and in a money market with constant interest rate @xmath7 .",
    "the agent pays proportional transaction cost @xmath1 for trading stocks , with the goal of optimizing the total utility of wealth at the final time @xmath0 , when she would be required to close out her stock position and pay the resulting transaction costs .",
    "the utility function is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to this optimized utility of wealth as the value function . in this paper , we compute the asymptotic expansion of the value function up to and including the order @xmath10 we also find a simple _  nearly - optimal \" _ trading policy that , if followed , produces an expected utility of the final wealth that asymptotically matches the value function at the order of @xmath10    in section [ sec : setup ] of this paper we define our model , state the hjb equation , and state merton s result for the case of zero transaction costs . under the smoothness assumption of the value function , in section [ sec : heuristic ] we provide a heuristic expansion of the value function in powers of @xmath11 . in the next section we use this heuristic",
    "expansion in order to build smooth functions @xmath12 , which we later prove to be upper and lower bounds on the value function @xmath13 .",
    "these functions also turn out to be sub- and supersolutions for the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation .",
    "it is then possible to apply the comparison principle for viscosity solutions to conclude that the value function @xmath13 , which is a viscosity solution for the hjb equation , has to be between the super- and subsolutions .",
    "however , this method is only applicable for @xmath14",
    ". therefore we use a verification argument from stochastic calculus . in the final section",
    "we construct a simple policy and in theorem [ thm : comp ] prove that @xmath12 are indeed upper and lower bounds on the value function @xmath13 . as a corollary we also get that the expected utility of the final wealth from the constructed policy is order @xmath15 close to the value function , which makes this policy a _  nearly - optimal \" _ policy .    in the case of zero transaction cost",
    ", the agent s optimal policy is to keep a constant proportion of wealth @xmath16 , which we call the _ merton proportion _ , invested in stock .",
    "see pham @xcite , or alternately the original paper of merton @xcite where a solution to a similar investment and consumption problem with infinite time horizon appears .    when @xmath1 , the optimal policy is to trade as soon as the position is sufficiently far away from the _",
    "merton proportion_. more specifically , the agent s optimal policy is to maintain her position inside a region that we refer to as the _  no - trade \" _",
    "( nt ) region .",
    "if the agent s position is initially outside the nt region , she should immediately sell or buy stock in order to move to its boundary .",
    "the agent then will trade only when her position is on the boundary of the nt region , and only as much as necessary to keep it from exiting the nt region , while no trading occurs in the interior of the region ; see davis , panas , & zariphopoulou @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the width of the nt region depends on time , which makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly the optimal policy .",
    "moreover , the nt region degenerates when the _ merton proportion _ @xmath17 , i.e. it is optimally to be fully invested in stock , since in this case , the agent only needs to trade at the initial time to buy stock , and the final time to liquidate his position .",
    "we will not consider this case .",
    "the approach of this paper , is to expand the value function into a power series in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "this approach , which leads to explicit results , was pioneered by janeek & shreve @xcite in solving the infinite horizon investment and consumption problem .",
    "many other papers have used asymptotical expansion including goodman & ostrov @xcite , who showed how the first term in asymptotical expansion of the value function relates to a free boundary problem that minimizes a cost function .",
    "they also showed that the quasi - steady state density of the portfolio is constant in the nt region .",
    "janeek & shreve @xcite used it to solve a problem of optimal investment and consumption with one futures contract , and bichuch @xcite applied it to the case of two correlated futures contracts .",
    "dewynne , howison , law & lee @xcite heuristsically found a time independent policy in a finite horizon problem with multiple correlated stocks . under the assumption that _ the principle of smooth fit _ holds and that the boundaries are symmetrical around the merton proportion , they heuristically computed the asymptotic location of the boundaries of the nt region .",
    "we prove this result rigorously for a problem with one risky asset , and quantify the optimality of the proposed policy .",
    "numerical results provided by gennotte & jung @xcite and liu & loewenstein @xcite show that the optimal boundaries are not symmetrical around the merton proportion and that they are complicated functions of time .",
    "for instance , dai & yi @xcite find a time , of order @xmath15 close to final time @xmath0 , after which the agent would no longer buy stock .",
    "the intuitive explanation is that it is wasteful spending to buy extra stocks , standing very close to final time , only to sell them all a moment later , without realizing virtually any profit , since the agent held them for very little time .",
    "our goal instead is to find a simple _  nearly - optimal \" _ policy .",
    "we rely on the results obtained by dai & yi @xcite , who use a pde approach to problem to show a connection between the optimal investment problem and a double obstacle problem . using the theory of the obstacle problem",
    ", they show that the value function is smooth ( see theorem 5.1 for exact formulation ) .",
    "they also characterize the behaviors of the free boundaries .",
    "transaction costs were introduced into merton s model by magill & constantinides @xcite .",
    "their analysis of the infinite time horizon investment and consumption problem , despite being heuristic , gives an insight into the optimal strategy and the existence of the nt region .",
    "a more rigorous analysis of the same infinite time horizon problem was given by davis & norman @xcite , who under certain assumptions showed that the value function is smooth .",
    "the viscosity solution approach to that infinite time horizon problem was pioneered by shreve & soner @xcite , who significantly weakened the assumptions of davis & norman @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the dynamic programming approach above is to use the martingale duality approach .",
    "cvitani & karatzas @xcite in a finite time horizon investment problem using duality proved the existence of an optimal strategy , under the assumption that a dual minimization problem admits a solution .",
    "later cvitani & wang @xcite proved the existence of a solution to the dual problem . in a more general framework with multiple assets",
    "kabanov @xcite proved the existence of an optimal strategy , also assuming the existence of a minimizer to the dual problem .",
    "subsequent existence results under more relaxed assumptions were proved in deelstra , pham & touzi @xcite and campi & owen @xcite .",
    "while the problem of optimal investment in the presence of transaction costs is important in its own right , it has further value in the study of contingent claim pricing .",
    "hodges and neuberger @xcite proposed to price an option so that a utility maximizer is indifferent between either having a certain initial capital for investment or else holding the option but having initial capital reduced by the price of the option .",
    "this produces both a price and a hedge , the latter being the difference in the optimal trading strategies in the problem without the option and the problem with the option .",
    "this utility - based option pricing is examined in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a formal asymptotic analysis of such an approach appears in whalley & wilmott @xcite .",
    "they assume a power expansion for the value function and compute the leading terms of it for both the case of holding the option liability and the case without it .",
    "their proof corresponds to the heuristic derivation section in this paper .",
    "we believe this paper is a step in the direction of providing a rigorous proof to a corresponding result with power utility .",

    "the value function @xmath13 is concave , so @xmath608 is monotone . by taking the derivative of @xmath13 in the @xmath609 and @xmath610 regions ( see ( [ eq : solutionbs ] ) and ( [ eq : solutionss ] ) ) we see that @xmath611.\\ ] ] it follows that for @xmath612 and @xmath613 , and hence for all @xmath614 $ ] , @xmath615    we also know that @xmath616 is continuous for @xmath617 . from equations  ( [ eq : solutionbs ] ) and ( [ eq : solutionss ] ) it follows that @xmath618 for @xmath619",
    ". we can thus write @xmath620 if @xmath621 , the term @xmath622 is set equal to zero ( see @xcite , equation ( a.5 ) ) , and the above equation still holds . in order to satisfy equation  ( [ eq : hjb2 ] ) we must have @xmath623",
    "it follows that @xmath624 where the @xmath625 sign is for @xmath626 and the @xmath627 sign is for @xmath628 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is valid so long as @xmath629 .",
    "the case of @xmath630 can be considered a _ singular _",
    "case for which the parameter @xmath210 appearing in a denominator in the definition of @xmath631 is zero .",
    "the intuition is that if the optimal proportion in the risky asset is 100% of wealth , then the investor does not incur any transaction costs due to adjusting the position size , as soon as the agent s position equals the optimum of 100% in stock .",
    "however , in order to consume the agent must transfer money from stock to money market and pay the transaction cost .",
    "we could regard this transaction cost as a _ consumption tax_.",
    "it follows that the loss in value function is of order of @xmath15 rather than @xmath632 . in @xcite , theorems 11.2 and 11.6 show that in this case @xmath633 , and @xcite , corollary 9.10 asserts that @xmath634 or equivalently , @xmath635 we see then that @xmath636 which is consistent with ( [ eq : result ] ) .      the optimal consumption policy @xmath639 is given by @xmath640 ( see ( [ eq : hjb ] ) and ( [ eq : dual ] ) ) . since @xmath641 ( see ( [ eq : valuefct ] ) ) , we have @xmath642 where we have used ( [ 4.24 ] ) .",
    "therefore , theorem  [ thm : main ] implies that the optimal consumption in feedback form is @xmath643 observe that for sufficiently small @xmath15 the existence of transaction costs _ increases _ the size of consumption for @xmath644 , while the consumption is _ decreased _ for @xmath645 .",
    "the intuition explaining this observation is related to the fact that the _ index of inter - temporal substitution _ , which is equal to @xmath646 , is high for small @xmath413 .",
    "an agent with index of inter - temporal substitution higher than 1 will optimally avoid some transaction costs resulting from trading by consuming faster .",
    "there is considerable evidence that @xmath647 we have just seen in ( [ 4.25 ] ) that this is the case when @xmath17 ( and consequently @xmath637 ) . in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] ,",
    "any choice of @xmath648 gives us a subsolution of the form @xmath649 ( the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : mcondition ] ) is needed only for the supersolution argument . )",
    "finally , the coefficient @xmath650 on @xmath15 can be obtained by a tedious heuristic analysis along the lines of section 3 .    in remark  [ rem:100 ]",
    "we introduced the concept of _ consumption tax _ as an interpretation of the transaction cost an agent must pay in order to first move capital from stock to money market before consuming it . in that remark ,",
    "the agent was ideally 100% invested in stock .",
    "if instead the agent seeks to hold a proportion @xmath629 in stock , then consuming proportionally from stock and money market , the agent would pay a consumption tax @xmath651 times the total consumption .",
    "to highest order , the optimal consumption level is thus @xmath652 of what it would be if there were no transaction cost , and this multiplies the value function by @xmath653 the value function for zero transaction cost when wealth is @xmath654 is @xmath655 , and so after this multiplication , the value function has been reduced by @xmath656 which is the order @xmath15 term we see in ( [ orderlambda ] ) .",
    "we thus expect the value function for the problem with transaction cost @xmath15 to be reduced from the zero - transaction cost value function @xmath655 by at least @xmath657 , this reduction being due solely to the cost of moving capital from stock to money market in order to consume .",
    "there is also a cost of trading to stay in the @xmath658 wedge , which reduces the value function by @xmath659 , but can not further reduce the value function by an order @xmath15 term because then the value function would fall below the lower bound ( [ 4.28 ] ) .    under the assumption that ( [ orderlambda ] ) holds , one can improve the calculations in theorem [ thm : ntwidth ] .",
    "we already have from theorem [ thm : ntwidth ] and its proof that @xmath660 and that @xmath661 for @xmath662 $ ] .",
    "the mean - value theorem gives @xmath663 and @xmath664 using lemma [ lemma : uexpansion ] , we obtain @xmath665 we write for @xmath626 and @xmath628 similarly as in theorem  [ thm : ntwidth ] @xmath666 > from @xmath667 , we now see that @xmath668 which implies @xmath669 this suggests that the optimal policy is to keep a wider wedge on the right side of the merton proportion @xmath16 .",
    "this extra width makes sense because consumption reduces the money market position",
    ".    we can do the same calculation for @xmath17 , in which case @xmath670 .",
    "taking the square roots in ( [ 4.29 ] ) , ( [ 4.30 ] ) , we now have @xmath671 in fact , when @xmath17 , we have @xmath672 , as we saw in remark  [ rem:100 ] .    in the key formulas derived in this paper",
    ", the transaction cost parameter @xmath15 appears in combination with @xmath673 .",
    "according to theorem [ thm : main ] , the highest order loss in the value function due to transaction costs is @xmath674 > from theorem [ thm : ntwidth ] , we see that @xmath675    one way to see the intrinsic nature of the quantity @xmath676 is to define the proportion of capital in stock , @xmath677 , and apply it s formula when @xmath678 is generated by the optimal triple @xmath679 , for which @xmath26 and @xmath27 are continuous , to derive the equation @xmath680 we see that the response of @xmath681 to relative changes in the stock price is @xmath682 .",
    "when replicating an option by trading , the position held by the hedging portfolio , denominated in shares of stock , is called the _",
    "delta _ of the option , and the sensitivity of the delta to changes in the stock price is the _",
    "gamma_. we have here a similar situation , except that @xmath681 is the _ proportion _ of capital held in stock , rather than the _ number of shares _ of stock , and @xmath682 is the sensitivity of this proportion to _ relative _ changes in the stock price .",
    "we can now obtain the quantities in ( [ 4.31 ] ) and ( [ 4.32 ] ) by the following heuristic argument .",
    "suppose when the transaction cost is @xmath1 we choose to keep @xmath681 in an interval @xmath683 $ ] , trading in order to create reflection at the endpoints of this interval .",
    "as compared to the optimal expected utility corresponding to zero transaction costs , this entails two losses : the loss due to displacement ( not always having @xmath684 ) and the loss due to transaction costs .",
    "the first increases with @xmath685 while the second decreases .",
    "we wish to choose @xmath685 to balance these losses , i.e. , to minimize their sum .",
    "in ( [ 3.0 ] ) we computed the loss due to displacement @xmath686 to be @xmath687 in the present case , the displacement is a random , time - varying quantity taking values in @xmath688 $ ] . however , for small @xmath689 , for each positive @xmath30 the distribution of @xmath681 in @xmath688 $ ] is approximately uniform .",
    "therefore , the loss due to displacement in the present model is approximately @xmath690    consider a brownian motion doubly reflected in order to stay in @xmath688 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath691 , where @xmath692 $ ] for all @xmath30 , @xmath29 grows only when @xmath693 and @xmath31 grows only when @xmath694 .",
    "then @xmath695 .",
    "( use it s formula to write @xmath696 divide by @xmath30 , and let @xmath697 to conclude @xmath698 for any @xmath699 function @xmath122 . ) the amount of `` transacting '' done at both boundaries grows at rate @xmath700 per unit time .",
    "because the @xmath701 term in ( [ 4.33 ] ) is multiplied by @xmath702 , and scaling brownian motion by a constant is like scaling time by the square of the constant , the amount of transacting done to keep @xmath681 in @xmath688 $ ] grows at rate @xmath703 per unit time .",
    "this causes a relative loss of capital @xmath704 per unit time .",
    "incurring this loss is equivalent to having zero transaction cost but with the mean rate of return of both the stock and the money market reduced by @xmath705 . according to ( [ 2.a])([2.c ] ) , the optimal expected utility in such",
    "a problem is @xmath706 therefore , the loss due to transaction costs is approximately @xmath707    the total loss is approximately @xmath708 . setting @xmath709 and solving for @xmath685 , we obtain @xmath710 the leading term in ( [ 4.32 ] ) . with this value of @xmath685 , we have @xmath711 thereby obtaining the term in ( [ 4.31 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quantity @xmath712 also plays a fundamental role in the formal asymptotic expansions of whalley & wilmott @xcite .",
    "in fact , even the constants @xmath713 and @xmath714 in ( [ 4.31 ] ) and ( [ 4.32 ] ) appear in @xcite , the first at the end of section 3.3 and the second in equation ( 3.10 ) .",
