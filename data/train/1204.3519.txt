    "from the spectroscopic point of view we distinguish the cooler b  type subdwarf ( sdb ) stars , with effective temperature @xmath4 40,000 k , and the hotter o  type ( sdo ) stars , with @xmath5 40,000 k @xcite .",
    "most sdb stars are helium poor and display no or only weak helium lines , while most sdo stars are helium rich and show hei and heii lines . while the sdbs form a homogenous group , the sdos show a wide spread in temperature ( @xmath6 = 40,000100,000 k ) , gravity ( log(@xmath7 ) = 46.5 ) and helium abundance @xcite .",
    "historically , sdo stars were divided into ` luminous ' and ` compact ' sdos , depending on their value of log(@xmath7 ) .",
    "one possible mechanism responsible for the loss of the massive hydrogen envelopes of hot subdwarfs is mass transfer in a binary .",
    "indeed , there is substantial evidence that many hot subdwarfs are in close binary systems @xcite . in particular , a large fraction of binaries is found among sdb stars .",
    "models of binary evolution @xcite predict that many of the subdwarf companions should be white dwarfs ( wd ) . indeed a few sdb+wd are known @xcite , and recent optical studies of single  lined spectroscopic binaries yielded several new candidates @xcite .",
    "the presence of a compact companion ( a wd , neutron star ( ns ) , or black hole ) could be revealed by the detection of x  ray emission powered by accretion , if the subdwarf mass  donor can provide a sufficiently high accretion rate .",
    "short swift / xrt observations of candidate sdb+wd / ns binaries , selected from the @xcite sample , gave x  ray luminosity upper limits of @xmath8 erg s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these limits confirm that sdb stars have rather weak stellar winds , unable to provide enough accretion rate .",
    "although the fraction of binaries among sdo stars is not as high as for the sdbs , the prospects to find x  ray emitting companions are more promising for these stars .",
    "in fact , at least a few luminous sdo stars show evidence for stellar winds with mass loss rate @xmath9 yr@xmath2 @xcite . among these",

    "no other x  ray detections of sdo stars have been reported up to now .",
    "prompted by our findings on , we carried out an x  ray observation of another bright sdo star .",
    "our target is  @xcite , a luminous sdo which is often referred to as an ` extreme helium star ' because of its complete lack of hydrogen ( while  has about 20 % ( by mass ) of hydrogen ) : it shows evidence for significant mass loss rate @xcite and stellar parameters similar to those of ( see tab .",

    "the source spectrum is very soft : a fit with an absorbed power law gives an unphysically large photon index ( @xmath26 ) , while a blackbody gives a temperature @xmath27 = 93 ev .",
    "however , these single  component models give unacceptable fits ( @xmath28 2 ) . a model consisting of an absorbed power law plus blackbody",

    "rays , with a typical ratio of x  ray to optical flux of the order of log(@xmath40 ) = -6.45 @xmath10 0.51 @xcite .",
    "it is not known if this relation holds also for low luminosity stars .",
    "the only other sdo star possibly detected in x ",

    "the x  ray flux of @xmath41 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , visible when the accreting wd companion is in eclipse , corresponds to log(@xmath40 ) = -7.4 and could be due to emission from the sdo @xcite . for",
    "we measure log(@xmath40 ) = -6.63 , consistent with the above values , but the significant periodic modulation at 19.156 s clearly indicates that most of , or possibly all , the detected flux originates in a compact companion star , rather than in  itself .",
    "the periodic modulation can be explained equally well as the spin period of a ns or of a wd .",
    "ultraviolet spectra of , acquired with the iue satellite , show nv and civ resonance lines with p cygni - like profiles , indicating the presence of a stellar wind @xcite .",
    "a more recent analysis of uv and optical spectra of  has been reported by @xcite , who derived a mass loss rate of 3@xmath1910@xmath42 @xmath11 yr@xmath2 and a wind terminal velocity of @xmath43 = 2,000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that part of the sdo stellar wind is captured by its compact companion , giving rise to accretion powered x  ray emission .",
    "the density and velocity of the wind material at the position of the compact object can be computed assuming a canonical wind velocity law with radial dependence @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the radial distance in units of stellar radii and the index @xmath46 is typically in the range 0.61 .",
    "assuming for simplicity bondi  hoyle accretion , and relating the orbital separation to the period of a circular orbit @xmath47 through kepler s law , we can derive the expected accretion luminosity as a function of @xmath47 shown in fig .",
    "[ luminosita ] .",
    "the curves refer to a ns of 1.4 @xmath11 and 10 km radius , and to a wd of 0.6 @xmath11 and 10,000 km radius ; in both cases we used for  a mass of 0.9 @xmath11 @xcite . we have also indicated in the figure the allowed range of luminosity of the blackbody component ( for simplicity we do not consider the additional 30 % contribution to the total luminosity coming from the power ",
    "law component ) .",
    "although the observed luminosity is only poorly constrained due to the large uncertainties in the spectral parameters , it is clearly consistent with that expected from a ns orbiting  with a period between about one and several days .",
    "the blackbody emitting radius derived from the best fit , @xmath33 km ( for @xmath37 = 2 kpc ) , is only marginally consistent with a neutron star .",
    "however , this parameter is strongly correlated with the poorly constrained slope of the power law spectral component and an acceptable fit can be obtained , e.g. , with @xmath30 = 1.5 , @xmath48 58 ev , and @xmath49 10 km .",
    "alternatively , the accreting companion could be a wd , if the sdo extends to ( or close to ) the roche  lobe , thus yielding an accretion rate larger than what we computed assuming wind accretion ( or in the unlikely case that the adopted distance is largely overestimated ) .",
    "the observed spectrum is much softer than the typical spectrum of neutron stars in classical x  ray binaries , which however have very different companion stars and accrete at higher rates .",
    "it should also be considered that we can observe the low temperature emission from  ( and , see below ) only because these sources are at high galactic latitude , where interstellar x - ray absorption is very small .",
    "up to now  was believed to be a single star : no evidence for a companion was seen in spectroscopic @xcite or photometric data @xcite , and infrared observations did not show any excess emission @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the very few published radial velocity measurements are inconsistent with a single value , hinting to a possible binary motion .",
    "a radial velocity @xmath50 = 156.4 @xmath10 1.1 km s@xmath2 is given in the original discovery paper @xcite , while @xcite found @xmath50 = 94 @xmath10 1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "new accurate radial measurements are needed to determine the parameters of this binary .",
    "the x  ray properties of  are very similar to those of the only other x  ray source associated with an sdo star : . in this binary a massive white dwarf accretes matter from the stellar wind of its subdwarf companion @xcite .",
    "also in the case of  the x  ray emission is pulsed , with a period ( 13.2 s ) similar to that we have discovered in , and the soft spectrum is well described by the sum of a blackbody with @xmath27 = 39 ev and a power law with @xmath30 = 1.6 @xcite .",
    "has an orbital period of 1.55 days , first discovered through radial velocity measurements of the sdo optical emission @xcite , and an x  ray luminosity of 10@xmath51 erg s@xmath2 ( at @xmath37 = 650 pc ) .",
    "the fact that the only two sdo stars observed with sensitive x  ray instruments turned out to be binaries with a compact companion is noteworthy .",
    "although it is premature to draw conclusions from such small numbers , this might suggest that the fraction of sdo binaries is larger than currently believed on the basis of optical observations .",
    "note that , contrary to late type companions , which can give a detectable contribution in the spectral and photometric data , wds and nss are too faint and completely outshined in the optical / uv by the sdo emission . both  and  belong to the subclass of luminous , he - rich sdos , whose origin and evolutionary link with other classes of stars is still unclear @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "x  ray observations might provide important information to complement optical / uv data . besides the potential of discovering other sdo binaries through the detection of pulsations , the high sensitivity of current satellites like  and chandra can probe the x  ray emission of single sdos , and test whether their wind emission scales as in early type stars of higher luminosity .",
