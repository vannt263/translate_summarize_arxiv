    "as firstly proposed by enrico fermi @xcite as an attempt to describe the high energy of cosmic particles interacting with moving magnetic clouds , the fermi accelerator model consists of a classical particle of mass @xmath0 ( denoting the cosmic particle ) confined to bounce between two rigid walls .",
    "one is periodically moving in time ( making allusions to the moving magnetic clouds ) while the other one is fixed ( working as a returning mechanism for a next collision with the moving wall ) .",
    "the phase space of the model is defined by the type of the motion of the moving wall . for a smoothly periodic motion ,",
    "say a sinusoidally function , periodic islands , chaotic seas and a set of invariant kam curves are all observed coexisting in the phase space .",
    "the diffusion in the velocity is limited by the kam curves and , deceptively , fermi acceleration ( unlimited energy growth ) is not observed . on the other hand when the motion of the moving wall is considered of saw - tooth type ,",
    "the mixed structure of the phase space is not observed anymore and unlimited energy is observed .",
    "the interest in fermi acceleration has then increased and several applications have been observed in different areas of science including astrophysics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , optics @xcite , atomic physics @xcite and even in time dependent billiard problems @xcite . the traditional approach to describe fermi acceleration developing in such type of time dependent system is generally given in terms of a diffusion process which takes place in momentum space .",
    "the evolution of the probability density function for the magnitude of particle velocities as a function of the number of collisions is determined by the fokker - planck equation and results for the one - dimensional case consider either static wall approximation and moving boundary description @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon however seems not to be robust since dissipation is assumed to be a mechanism to suppress fermi acceleration @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the one - dimensional fermi accelerator model however considering the motion of the moving wall given by a van der pol type and considering two cases : ( i ) the mass of the particle is negligible as compared to mass of the moving wall ; ( ii ) the collisions of the particle affect the motion of the moving wall , which are restored to a limit cycle after a relaxation time .",
    "our main goal is to understand and describe the influences of a limit cycle type motion of the moving wall to the dynamics of the particle and hence to the properties of the average velocity in the phase space . to the best knowledge of the authors ,",
    "this is the first time this approach is considered in this model and the results may have applications to different set of models , particularly to the class of time - dependent billiard problems .",
    "the model then consists of a classical particle of mass @xmath0 which suffers collisions with two walls .",
    "one is moving in time whose motion is described by a van der pol equation leading to a limit cycle dynamics while the other one is fixed and works as a returning mechanism of the particle to a next collision with the moving wall .",
    "the dynamics is constructed by a two dimensional nonlinear mapping for the variables velocity of the particle and time . for case ( i )",
    "the dynamics leads to a mixed phase space structure where periodic islands are observed surrounded by chaotic seas and limited by a set of invariant kam curves .",
    "as soon as the parameter @xmath1 controlling the non - linearity of the moving wall raises , the position of the lowest invariant kam curve raises too leading to an increase in the average velocity of the particle . scaling arguments are used to describe the behavior of the average velocity as a function of the parameter @xmath1 and a set of critical exponents are obtained . on the other hand for case ( ii )",
    ", the collisions of the particle with the moving wall indeed affect the dynamics of such wall , leading it out / in of the limit cycle .",
    "after a relaxation time however , the moving wall reaches the limit cycle again .",
    "a set of different periodic attractors is observed in the phase space and the organization of the basin of attraction of each attractor shows to be complicate .",
    "a histogram of periodic orbits is also constructed leading us to observe a high incidence of low period orbits as compared to large period .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we construct the model and describe the equations that give the dynamics of the motion .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to discuss the case of negligible mass of the particle including results of the phase space , characterization of chaotic orbits and scaling of the average velocity .",
    "the case where collisions of the particle affect the motion of the moving wall is described in sec .",
    "conclusions and final remarks are drawn in sec .",
    "in this section we present all the details needed for the construction of the mapping .",
    "the model consists of a classical particle of mass @xmath0 which is confined to bounce between two walls .",
    "one of the them is assumed to be fixed at position @xmath2 and collisions are assumed to be elastic .",
    "the other one moves in time and the oscillations are described by a van der pol oscillator whose average position is @xmath3 .",
    "we describe two situations where : ( i ) the mass of the particle is sufficiently small as compared to the mass of the moving wall and , ( ii ) the case where the mass of the particle is not negligible therefore affecting the dynamics of the moving wall .    indeed , the van der pol oscillator is a generalization of a harmonic oscillator that contains a nonlinear and dissipative term .",
    "applications of the van der pol oscillator can be found in many different systems including dusty plasma @xcite , coupled oscillators @xcite and many others .",
    "the differential equation describing the van der pol oscillator is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass , @xmath6 denotes the dissipative term and @xmath7 is the hook s constant .",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath8 creates a competition between adding and subtracting energy to / from the system . when @xmath9 there is a frictional drag force while for @xmath10",
    "there is a negative friction .",
    "this competition has a balance of energy such that the sum of the added and reduced energy in a cycle is zero , therefore creating a periodic motion which is commonly called in the literature as limit cycle .",
    "when @xmath11 there is a sinusoidal motion with a quasi - circular limit cycle of radius @xmath12 . with the growth of @xmath6 , the limit cycle changes to a particular form and the time of relaxation of the oscillator becomes shorter .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a typical phase space obtained from numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) , by using the gauss - radau @xcite integrator , for the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and : ( a ) @xmath15 ; ( b ) @xmath16 and ; ( c ) @xmath17 .     and : ( a ) @xmath15 ; ( b ) @xmath16 and ; ( c ) @xmath17 . ]    to describe the model itself , we have to define a set of dimensionless and therefore more convenient variables . defining @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 the equation is rewritten as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 was set as null . with this new variables ,",
    "the distance between the average position of the moving wall and fixed wall becomes dimensionless and equals @xmath24 .    in our description and to determine the law that describes the collisions",
    ", we assumed that the momentum and energy are conserved at the instant of each collision . with this approach ,",
    "the velocities of the particle and the moving wall after the @xmath25 collision are @xmath26 where the upper index @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the particle and moving wall respectively . here",
    "@xmath29 denotes the ratio of mass of the particle and the mass of the moving wall . therefore the particle and the moving wall change energy and momentum upon collision . in the general case , after the collision of the particle with the moving wall and , due to the change of energy , the velocity of the moving wall changes therefore bringing the moving wall out of the limit cycle .",
    "however and depending on the control parameters , the limit cycle is approached again asymptotically .",
    "therefore we have to consider two separate cases : ( i ) @xmath30 and ; ( ii ) @xmath31 . for case ( i ) ,",
    "i.e. , when the mass of the particle is sufficiently small as compared to the mass of the moving wall @xmath32 leading to the limit of @xmath30 . for this case we assumed that either energy and velocity of the moving wall are not changed after the collision , therefore @xmath33 .",
    "for case ( ii ) where @xmath34 , the collisions of the particle with the moving wall indeed affect the motion of the moving wall bringing it in or out of the limit cycle .",
    "it however relaxes again to the limit cycle as time evolves .",
    "we therefore consider the two cases in separate sections .",
    "in this section we discuss the case of @xmath30 .",
    "it implies that the velocity of the moving wall is not affected by the change of energy with the particle i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , once relaxed to the limit cycle , the moving wall stays in such a regime forever .",
    "for such a dynamical regime , we can also calculate a period of oscillation @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamics is then described by a two - dimensional mapping for the variables velocity of the particle and phase of the moving wall @xmath36~ mod ~ t,\\nonumber\\\\ v_{n+1 } & = &   2v_w(\\phi_{n+1})\\pm v_n , \\label{mapamu=0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath37 sign of second term stands for successive collisions while @xmath38 denotes non successive collisions .",
    "a successive collision is defined as a collision that the particle has with the moving wall without leaving the collision zone , i.e. , without been reflected backwards by the fixed wall . here",
    "@xmath39 is the phase of the moving wall while @xmath40 is the velocity of the particle and the index @xmath41 denotes the instant of the @xmath42 collision with the moving wall .",
    "the term @xmath43 represents the velocity of the moving wall that is obtained numerically from the integration of the van der pol oscillator ( eq . [ vanderpol ] ) .",
    "it indeed has two relevant control parameters namely , @xmath44 and @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 controls the amplitude of the limit cycle and @xmath1 controls the amplitude of nonlinear dissipative term . the term @xmath45 is solved numerically from the equation @xmath46 for successive collisions and @xmath47 for non successive collisions . for the case of @xmath30 ,",
    "the mapping preserves the following measure in the phase space @xmath48 .",
    "the phase space for the case of @xmath30 is mixed and periodic islands , kam curves and a chaotic sea are observed , as shown in fig .",

    "( i ) green for kam curves ; ( ii ) blue for periodic islands and ; ( iii ) red for chaotic dynamics .",
    "indeed the dynamics along a kam curve is quasi - regular leading to a small variance of the velocity of the particle while all phases are in principle allowed leading to a seemingly closed curve as shown in fig .",

    "our investigation is as function of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "to do so , we chose to describe the behavior of the average velocity of the particle along the chaotic orbits as well as the behavior of the positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "let us start with the average velocity .",
    "to do so , we consider the evolution of the average velocity of the particle as a function of the number of collisions @xmath41 as well as the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath1 .",
    "the average velocity is obtained as @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the total number of initial conditions ( ensemble of different particles ) and @xmath61 is the average velocity obtained along the orbit for a single initial condition .",
    "it is defined as @xmath62 where the index @xmath63 corresponds to one orbit of the ensemble @xmath60 .",
    "this kind of ensemble average is widely used in many different dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "several tests were made and shown that a results with low fluctuation is obtained with an ensemble of initial condition @xmath60 of the order @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the simulations involved in the calculation of @xmath66 are extremely time consuming especially due to the numerical solution of eq .",
    "[ vanderpol ] . as an attempt to speed up the simulations , we introduced a new method to calculate the average velocity .",
    "indeed it can be used because the mapping preserves a measure in the phase space and , due to poincar recurrence theorem , the particle may returns to close to a neighboring region to where it started as one wants .",
    "suppose a time series @xmath67 is given , where @xmath68 .",
    "we define @xmath69 as a sup value of velocity for region of low energy in the phase space that belongs to the chaotic sea .",
    "indeed @xmath69 should be larger than the velocity of the moving wall and at the same time should be smaller as compared to first kam curve .",
    "then we construct a vector @xmath70 where @xmath7 is a series from each @xmath41 for those velocities where the condition @xmath71 is observed such that @xmath63 is an index that represents the times this will occur .",
    "thus we define the transformations @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denotes the dimension of vector @xmath7 . using this procedure , the evolution of a single orbit for a long time is enough to obtain the average properties and therefore to speed up the simulations as compared to the normal method of evolving a long ensemble of different initial conditions .",
    "to have an idea of the accuracy of the proposed method , fig .",

    "bullets correspond to the traditional ( normal ) method of evolving an ensemble of initial conditions @xcite while squares denote the proposed method .",
    "we see that curve generated by the two methods remarkably overlap each other confirming the procedure can be used .",

    "the behavior observed in fig .",

    "given we have described the behavior of the average velocity , let us now concentrate to discuss the lyapunov exponent for chaotic orbits . indeed the lyapunov exponent gives the exponential rate of divergence or convergence of the evolution of close initial conditions in phase space .",
    "thus when at least one lyapunov exponent @xmath113 positive , the system has a chaotic component .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is defined as @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the jacobian matrix evaluated along the orbit @xmath118 .    for the model described by the mapping [ mapamu=0 ] and considering a fixed value of @xmath44 , the positive lyapunov exponent averaged along the chaotic sea in the regime of low energy decreases as the control parameter @xmath1 increases .",

    "the basins of attraction of some attractors were obtained .    as a perspective of the study of this model with such type of perturbations ,",
    "a synchronization of the oscillator may be of interest and applications may be used to control chaos .",
    "other aspect of the model that can be studied is related to the introduction of two interacting particles in the system which exchange information through the perturbation caused by them in the moving wall .",

    "<S> a modification of the one - dimensional fermi accelerator model is considered in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of a classical particle of mass @xmath0 , confined to bounce elastically between two rigid walls where one is described by a non - linear van der pol type oscillator while the other one is fixed , working as a re - injection mechanism of the particle for a next collision , is carefully made by the use of a two - dimensional non - linear mapping . </S>",
    "<S> two cases are considered : ( i ) the situation where the particle has mass negligible as compared to the mass of the moving wall and does not affect the motion of it ; ( ii ) the case where collisions of the particle does affect the movement of the moving wall . for case ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> the phase space is of mixed type leading us to observe a scaling of the average velocity as a function of the parameter ( @xmath1 ) controlling the non - linearity of the moving wall . for large @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> a diffusion on the velocity is observed leading us to conclude that fermi acceleration is taking place . on the other hand for case ( ii ) , </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the moving wall is affected by collisions with the particle . </S>",
    "<S> however due to the properties of the van der pol oscillation , the moving wall relaxes again to a limit cycle </S>",
    "<S> . such kind of motion absorbs part of the energy of the particle leading to a suppression of the unlimited energy gain as observed in case ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space shows a set of attractors of different periods whose basin of attraction has a complicate organization . </S>"
