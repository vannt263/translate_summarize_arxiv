    "<S> we investigate the frequency and origin of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars in local group dwarf galaxies by means of a statistical , data - calibrated cosmological model for the hierarchical build - up of the milky way and its dwarf satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the model self - consistently explains the variation with dwarf galaxy luminosity of the observed : i ) frequency and [ fe / h ] range of cemp stars ; ii ) metallicity distribution functions ; iii ) star formation histories . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if primordial faint supernovae dominated the early metal enrichment , then cemp - no stars enriched by the first stellar generations should be present in _ all _ dwarf galaxies , with similar number of stars and cemp fractions at [ fe / h]@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the probability to observe a star that is carbon - enhanced within a given [ fe / h ] range strongly depends on the luminosity of the dwarf galaxy and , on average , it is an order of magnitude lower in `` classical '' sculptor - like dsph galaxies ( @xmath1 ) than in the least luminous ultra - faint dwarfs ( @xmath2 ) . in addition , we explain why it may be easier to find cemp - no stars at [ fe / h]@xmath3 in classical dsph galaxies than in ultra - faint dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> these are consequences of the dramatic variation in the fraction of stars at [ fe / h]@xmath4 with galaxy luminosity : @xmath5 for galaxies with @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we present model predictions for the low fe - tail and cemp fraction of stars in dwarf galaxies , with particular emphasis on the sculptor dsph , that can be used to shed light on the properties of the first stars .    </S>",
