    "several groups have worked for the past two decades on the generation of reliable models of low - mass stars , but it was nt until the late 1990s that they arrived to realistic models of these objects .",
    "the models of the group led by baraffe & chabrier are at present the most widely used ones , since they can reproduce very well many of the observational properties of low - mass stars .",
    "for example , the mass - magnitude and the mass - luminosity relations of these stars are very nicely reproduced by the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models . those models , however , still have some problems reproducing the effective temperature scale and the mass - radius relation of these stars .    in the case of the @xmath3 scale ,",
    "baraffe et al . (",
    "1998 ) find that at temperatures below @xmath2 3700k the models predict bluer v ",
    "i colors than the ones observed .",
    "a possible reason provided by the authors for this mismatch is a missing source of opacity in the optical that causes the stars to be fainter in v than what the models predict .    for the mass  radius relation",
    ", the models underestimate the radii of the stars by at least 10  % .",
    "this conclusion is based on the observational results from eclipsing binaries with errorbars of 3  % or less ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the problem may be that the `` standard models '' do not include the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "mullan & macdonald ( 2001 ) find that low - mass star models have larger radii and smaller @xmath3 when magnetic fields are taken into account .",
    "magnetic fields are generally enhanced by stellar rotation , and in close binaries ( where we are measuring systematically larger radii ) the stars are spun up by orbital synchronization .",
    "with the current observational techniques , double - lined detached eclipsing binaries are the only objects where we can measure simultaneously the mass and the radius of stars with error bars of less than 23  % . the technique is a well established one : the radial velocity ( rv ) curves of the binaries provide the masses as a function of the orbital inclination of the system . from their light curves ( lcs ) one",
    "can then measure the orbital inclination of the system and the radius of each star . also , by measuring the lcs at different wavelengths one can estimate the effective temperature of the stars .",
    "we have searched to date five photometry databases ( see companion paper in this proceedings by shaw & lpez - morales ) .",
    "the result of that search are 41 new detached eclipsing binaries with masses below 1@xmath0 . after identifying the binaries from the lcs in those databases ,",
    "we need to conduct follow - up observational campaigns to measure the optical and infrared light curves of the systems and their radial velocity curves .",
    "this is an extensive project that requires of large amounts of telescope time .",
    "currently we have been awarded time in the facilities listed in table 1 .",
    "our final goal is to obtain full , high quality lcs and rv curves to be able to determine the masses and the radii of the stars in those binaries with errors smaller than 3% .",
    "we have completed to date the optical ( vri ) light curves and radial velocity curves of three binaries : gu boo ( lpez - morales & ribas 2005 ) , rxj0239.1 ( torres et al .",
    ", in prep ) , and nsvs01031772 ( hereafter nsvs0103 ; lpez - morales et al . , submitted ) .",
    "near - ir light curves are also available for rxj0239.1 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the masses , radii , and temperatures derived for the components of each binary .",
    "the two stars in gu boo are almost identical to the stars in yy gem .",
    "the stars in the other two binaries , with masses between 0.5 and 0.55 @xmath0 and 0.7 and 0.73 @xmath0 respectively , fill - in two current gaps in the mass - radius relation .",
    "figure 1 shows the mass - radius relation of stars below 1@xmath0 .",
    "the lines represent the predictions of different models , using 0.35 gyr isochrones and a metallicity z = 0.02 .",
    "the open circles correspond to the previously known binaries cm dra ( lacy 1977 ; metcalfe et al .",
    "1996 ) , cu cnc ( delfosse et al . 1999 ; ribas 2003 ) , tres - her0 - 07621 ( creevey et al .",
    "2005 ) , and yy gem ( leung & schneider 1978 ; torres & ribas 2002 ) .",
    "the filled squares show the location in this diagram of the components of gu boo , rxj0239.1 , and nsvs0103 . except for tres - her0 - 07621 ,",
    "all the other stars show a clear trend towards larger radii than what the models predict .",
    "all the stars in binaries are at least 10% larger than what any of the models predict .",
    "figure 2 shows the mass ",
    "log(@xmath3 ) relation for gu boo , rxj0239.1 , and nsvs0103 ( open circles ) , yy gem ( filled circle ) , and cu cnc ( open triangles ) .",
    "the top figure corresponds to a metallicity of z=0.01 , the bottom figure is for a metallicity of z=0.02 .",
    "the age of both sets of isochrones is 0.35 gyrs .",
    "the bottom figure ( z=0.02 ) agrees with the trend observed by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where they find that below 37003800k the effective temperatures predicted by the models are larger than the ones observed in low - mass stars .",
    "we present in this paper the first results of an extensive observing campaign primarily aimed at providing an accurate empirical m - r relation for low - mass stars .",
    "our targets are low - mass eclipsing binaries , from where precise stellar masses and radii can be derived .",
    "these systems also provide an estimation of the @xmath3 of the stars .",
    "our current sample contains 41 new binaries with masses between 0.35 and 1.0@xmath0 . here",
    "we present the parameters of the first three of those binaries , gu boo , rxj0239.1 , and nsvs0103 , which provide six new valuable data points .",
    "the addition of those new data points to the mass  radius relation diagram ( see figure 1 ) strengthens the trend already suggested by the other binaries ( cm dra , cu cnc , and yy gem ) .",
    "that is , the models underestimate the radii of low - mass stars by at least 10  % .",
    "this is at least the case for the components of binaries .",
    "the few available measurements from single stars present a much larger scatter and larger error bars , preventing the identification of a clear trend , if any in fact exists .",
    "a mismatch is also apparent when the @xmath3 of the binaries are compared to the predictions by the models ( see figure 2 ) . in this case the temperatures are lower than the prediction by the models below @xmath2 37003800k , as already noticed by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "observations begin to reveal what appear to be two different populations of low - mass stars : non - active stars , whose parameters would be succesfully reproduced by the `` standard models '' ( i.e. those not including magnetic fields ) , and active stars , where the magnetic fields play an important role .",
