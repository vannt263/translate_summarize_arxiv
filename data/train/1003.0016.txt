    "observations have set the first constraints on the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , corresponding to the formation epoch of the first luminous objects ( see the review by fan , carilli , & keating 2006a ) .",
    "studies of gunn - peterson ( gp ) absorption in quasar spectra ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) , and related phenomena , suggest a qualitative change in the state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at @xmath4 , indicating a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the igm , from @xmath5 at @xmath6 , to @xmath7 ( by volume ) at @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is consistent with instantaneous reionization at @xmath9 ( komatsu et al .",
    "these data suggest that reionization is less an event than a process , beginning at @xmath10 , and with the ` percolation ' , or bubble overlap phase ending at @xmath4 to 7 .",
    "unfortunately , current methods for measuring the neutral fraction of the igm have fundamental limitations , as gp absorption saturates at low neutral fractions ( @xmath11 ) , and cmb polarization measurements are an integral measure of the thompson scattering optical depth back to @xmath12 . indeed , mesinger ( 2010 )",
    "has pointed out that there is no definitive evidence for ( or against ) a largely ionized igm , even as late as @xmath4 , while recent measurements of the temperature of the high @xmath13 ly@xmath14 forest suggest fairly late reionization ( @xmath15 ; bolton et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "luminous quasars at the end of cosmic reionization will generate the largest ionized regions in the universe during this epoch .",
    "these have been alternatively called cosmological strmgren spheres or quasar near - zones ( nz ) , and we adopt the latter to be consistent with the recent literature .",
    "the near - zone behavior has been described by numerous authors ( shapiro & giroux 1987 ; madau & rees 2000 ; cen & haiman 2000 ) . a straight - forward calculation",
    "( haiman 2002 ) shows that , when recombination is not important , and when the quasar lifetime is much less than the age of the universe , the physical size of the expected nz behaves as :    @xmath16^{-1 }   \\rm mpc\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the nz proper radius , @xmath18 is the rate of ionizing photons from the quasar , @xmath19 is the quasar host galaxy redshift , and @xmath20 is the quasar age .",
    "this calculation ignores clumping , and assumes the mean cosmic density over the large scales being considered .",
    "spectra of @xmath4 quasars show evidence for large ionized regions around bright quasars on proper scales @xmath21 mpc .",
    "the evidence comes in the form of excess transmission on the blue wing of the ly@xmath14 emission line , prior to the onset of full gp absorption .",
    "this excess emission has been interpreted as being due to the local ionizing effect of the quasar .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to use these nz to derive constraints on the igm neutral fraction , using the equation above and assuming mean quasar lifetimes derived from demographics ( white et al .",

    "the most detailed treatment of quasar near - zones associated with @xmath22 quasars to date is that by fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "they point out numerous factors that make the absolute measurement of the neutral fraction using nz radii difficult , including : ( i ) uncertainties in the mean quasar lifetimes and ionizing photon rates , ( ii ) large scale structure in biased regions and pre - ionization by local galaxies , and ( iii ) clumpiness in the igm ( see also lidz et al . 2007 ; maselli et al . 2007 ;",
    "bolton & heahnelt 2007a , b ) .",
    "however , fan et al . also point out that over the narrow redshift range being considered , the systematics are likely to be comparable for all sources , and hence , ` if there is an order of magnitude evolution in the igm ionization , the size of the hii regions should show strong evolution , providing a reliable _ relative _ measurement of the neutral fraction ( with redshift ) . '",
    "more recently , wyithe et al . ( 2008 ) and bolton et al . (",
    "2010 ) have argued , based on numerical simulations , that the dominant effect on quasar near - zones during the end of reionization , or the percolation stage , when the overall neutral fraction is low , may be a rapidly increasing contribution to photo - ionization from the cosmic ionizing background with cosmic time , acting in concert with the quasar photons to lift the gp trough near the edge of the near - zone .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) emphasize that the measurements of the nz sizes are uncertain due to a number of factors , including the determination of where the transmission drops to zero , ie .",
    "the on - set of the gp effect ( @xmath23 ) , and the redshift of the host galaxy ( @xmath19 ) . to mitigate the former , they define the ionization zone , @xmath17 , as the region in which the transmitted flux ratio ( relative to the extrapolated continuum ) is above 0.1 when smoothed to a resolution of 20 @xmath24 . this is well above the average gp transmission for quasars at this redshift ( @xmath25 ) , and hence mitigates affects of a fluctuating igm , while still providing a good relative measurement of nz sizes over the narrow redshift range considered .",
    "willott et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have considered this technique for two @xmath4 quasars , and point out that the transmission can rise above 0.1 just one or two resolution elements further from the quasar , raising the question of where to draw the line for @xmath17 ? in this paper , we use the strict and quantifiable definition of fan et al .",

    "<S> we include more sources than previous studies , and we use more accurate redshifts for the host galaxies , with 8 co molecular line redshifts and 9 mgii redshifts . we confirm the trend for an increase in nz size with decreasing redshift , with the luminosity normalized proper size evolving as : @xmath1 mpc . while derivation of the absolute neutral fraction remains difficult with this technique , the evolution of the nz sizes suggests a decrease in the neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen by a factor @xmath2 from @xmath3 to 5.7 , in its simplest interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , recent numerical simulations suggest that this rapid increase in near - zone size from @xmath3 to 5.7 is due to the rapid increase in the background photo - ionization rate at the end of the percolation or overlap phase , when the average mean free path of ionizing photons increases dramatically . in either case , the results are consistent with the idea that @xmath4 to 7 corresponds to the tail end of cosmic reionization . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter in the normalized nz sizes is larger than expected simply from measurement errors , and likely reflects intrinsic differences in the quasars or their environments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the near - zone sizes increase with quasar uv luminosity , as expected for photo - ionization dominated by quasar radiation . </S>"
