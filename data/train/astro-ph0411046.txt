    "most elliptical galaxies are poor with respect to interstellar gas . also , elliptical galaxies invariably contain central massive black holes ( bhs ) , and there exists a tight relationship between the characteristic stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 and the bh mass @xmath0 @xcite , and between @xmath0 and the host spheroid mass in stars , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "are these two facts related ? here we focus on a scenario in which the mass of the central bh grows within gas rich elliptical progenitors until star formation has reduced the gas fraction in the central regions to of order 1% of the stellar mass . then radiative feedback during episodes when the bh luminosity approaches its eddington limit drives much of the gas out of the galaxy , limiting both future growth of the bh and future star formation to low levels .",
    "many works already recognized the importance of feedback as a key ingredient of the mutual bh and galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "what is new about this work is the stress on one component of the problem that has had relatively little attention : the radiative output of the central bh is not conjectural ",
    "it must have occured  and the high energy component of that radiative output will have a dramatic and calculable effect in heating the gas in ellipticals .    using the average quasar spectral output derived in @xcite , we show below and in more detail in @xcite that the limit on the central bh produced by the above argument coincides accurately with the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation . not only the slope , but also the small normalization factor is nicely reproduced .",
    "the present work is complementary to @xcite in that , while it does not attempt to model the complex flaring behavior of an accreting bh with an efficient hydrodynamical code , it does do a far more precise job of specifying the input spectrum and the detailed atomic physics required to understand the interaction between that spectrum and the ambient interstellar gas in elliptical galaxies .",
    "below we assess the conditions required for the central bh radiation to significantly heat the ism over a substantial volume of the galaxy . in this section",
    "we shall _ assume _ that the central bh has a mass as given by the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation for local ellipticals and bulges @xcite : = 1.510 ^ 8()^4 .",
    "[ sigma_mbh ] this assumption will be dropped in  [ origin ] , where we _ predict _ the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .    in @xcite",
    "we computed for the average quasar spectrum the equilibrium temperature @xmath4 ( at which heating due to compton scattering and photoionization balances cooling due to line and continuum emission ) of gas of cosmic chemical composition as a function of the ionization parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the bh bolometric luminosity . in the range @xmath7@xmath8k , ( )",

    "the galactic virial temperature is given by 3.010 ^ 6k ( ) ^2 .",
    "[ tvir ] we can then find the critical density @xmath13 defined by ( l / r^2)=[ncrit ] as a function of distance @xmath14 from the bh .",
    "gas with @xmath15 will be heated above @xmath16 and expelled from the galaxy .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ nr_tvir ] the resulting @xmath17 diagrams for a small and large bh / galaxy .",
    "plane for a galaxy with @xmath18kms@xmath19 ( @xmath20k , @xmath21 , upper panel ) , and with @xmath22kms@xmath19 ( @xmath23k , @xmath24 , lower panel ) . in the dashed area , gas can be heated above @xmath16 by radiation from the central bh emitting at the eddington luminosity .",
    "the upper boundary of this area scales linearly with luminosity .",
    "vertical boundaries are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . ]    in reality , provided that @xmath29 , significant heating will take place only out to a certain distance that depends on the luminosity and duration of the quasar outburst .",
    "since the bh releases via accretion a finite total amount of energy , @xmath30 , there is a characteristic limiting distance : = ( ) ^1/2 = 400pc()^1/2 ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "[ rc ] inside this radius , a low density , fully photoionized gas will be heated to the compton temperature @xmath31kev characteristic of the quasar spectral output .",
    "more relevant for the problem at hand is the distance out to which low density gas will be compton heated to @xmath32 : r_1=()^1/2= 1,300pc()^1/2 .",
    "[ r1 ] yet another characteristic radius is out to which gas of critical density @xmath13 will be heated to @xmath32 via photoinization and compton scattering : r_2=r_1 [ ( n_crit)/_c]^1/2 , [ r2 ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the compton and total heating rates , respectively . depending on gas density ( @xmath35 ) , the outer boundary of the `` blowout region '' will be located somewhere between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the size of the heating zone can be compared with the galaxy effective radius ~4,000pc ( ) ^2 .",
    "[ reff ]    the different characteristic distances defined above are shown as a function of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ mbh_radii ] .",
    "one can see that a bh of mass @xmath36 should be able to unbind the ism out to several @xmath28 . in the case of more massive bhs / galaxies with @xmath37@xmath38",

    "we now consider the following general idea .",
    "before the bh grows to a certain critical mass , @xmath39 , its radiation will be unable to efficiently heat the ambient gas , and the bh will accrete gas efficiently .",
    "once the bh has grown to @xmath39 , its radiation will heat and expell a substantial amount of gas from the central regions .",
    "feeding of the bh will then become self - regulated on a time scale of order the cooling time of the low density gas .",
    "subsequent central activity will be characterized by a very small duty cycle ( @xmath20.001 ) , as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "bh growth will be essentially terminated .",
    "suppose that the galaxy density distribution is that of a singular isothermal sphere , with the gas density following the total density : _",
    "gas(r)=. [ rho_gas ] here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the gas mass and total mass within the region affected by radiative heating .",
    "the size of the latter is uncertain but is less than a few kpc ( see  [ heatfar ] ) , so that @xmath41 is dominated by stars rather than by dark matter .",
    "radiation from the central bh can heat the ambient gas up to 6.510 ^ 3k ( ) ^-1 ( ) ^2 , [ tstat ] this approximate relation being valid in the range @xmath42@xmath8k .",
    "remarkably , @xmath4 does not depend on distance for the adopted @xmath43 density distribution .",
    "we then associate the transition from rapid bh growth to slow , feedback - limited bh growth with the critical condition = , [ tstat_tvir ] where @xmath44 and @xmath16 is given by ( [ tvir ] ) .",
    "once heated to @xmath45 , the gas will stop feeding the bh .",
    "the condition ( [ tstat_tvir ] ) will be met for = 4.610 ^ 10()^4 .",
    "[ mcrit ] therefore , for fixed values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 we expect @xmath49 , similarly to the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "equally important is the normalization of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation . by comparing ( [ mcrit ] ) with ( [ sigma_mbh ] )",
    "we find that the observed correlation will be established if /m=310 ^ -3 ^ -1l/. [ mgas_crit ] the gas - to - stars ratio is thus required to be low and approximately constant for spheroids of different mass at a certain stage of their evolution . as for the eddington ratio , it is reasonable to expect @xmath500.11 during quasar outbursts .",

    "thin solid line corresponds to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "[ s_mbh ] we show the predicted correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath1 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . it can be seen that the @xmath55 behavior is expected to break down for @xmath63 and for @xmath64  a few @xmath38 .",
    "it is perhaps interesting that the range of masses shown in fig .",
    "[ s_mbh ] for which @xmath55 is obtained from considerations of atomic phyisics ( and the observed agn spectra ) corresponds closely with the range of masses for which this power law provides a good fit to the observations . exploring the @xmath0@xmath1 relation observationally near @xmath38 would be a sensitive test of the importance of radiative feedback .",
    "in @xcite we addressed in a more quantitative way the bh growth in the context of the parent galaxy evolution .",
    "we adopted a physically - motivated one - zone model , taking into account the mass and energy return from the evolving stellar population .",
    "this model predicts that after an initial `` cold '' phase dominated by gas infall , once the gas density becomes sufficiently low the gas heating dominates and the galaxy switches to a `` hot '' solution .",
    "the gas mass / stellar mass ratio at that epoch ( @xmath20.003 ) is remarkably close to the value inferred above from the argument leading to the right @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "other predictions of the toy model are also in satisfactory agreement with observations .",
