    "we keep the discussion there quite general with a view towards possible applications other than isw measurements .",

    "the effect appears to be small on the large scales where the isw measurements are generally considered interesting ( we consider @xmath14 ) . the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein for more discussions .",

    "the lensing efficiency increases with the redshift of the source galaxies causing the magnification bias effect to increase with redshift as well .",
    "the scale dependence arises because each term depends on the matter distribution at different distances : the galaxy term depends on the matter distribution at the source redshifts while the magnification term depends on the distribution at the lenses .",

    "there are several features in figures [ cisw27 ] and [ cisw25 ] that are worth commenting .",
    "as is expected , the galaxy  temperature correlation @xmath70 decreases rapidly with redshift : at high @xmath1 , dark energy becomes subdominant making the time derivative of the gravitational potential quite small ( eq . [ [ deltatisw ] ] ) .",
    "note that this decrease of @xmath70 occurs despite the overall increase of the galaxy  bias with redshift .",
    "the magnification ",
    "temperature correlation @xmath71 , on the other hand , generally increases with redshift because of the increase of the lensing efficiency .",
    "the magnification ",
    "temperature correlation @xmath116 can be high even as @xmath117 becomes small , because the rather broad lensing weight function makes @xmath116 sensitive to structures at low redshifts where the gravitational potential has a significant time derivative .",
    "the general increase of @xmath71 with redshift is aided also by the increase of the number count slope @xmath47  at a higher @xmath1 one is generally looking at intrinsically brighter galaxies which reside in the steep part of the luminosity function .",
    "the net result is that the total cross - correlation @xmath118 starts to climb with redshift , for @xmath0 .",
    "in fact at a sufficiently high @xmath1 , @xmath119 even becomes comparable with @xmath118 or @xmath70 at the lowest redshift bin .",
    "comparing sample i and sample ii , one can see that a brighter magnitude cut leads to a more pronounced magnification bias effect .",
    "this is due to the steeper number count slope .",
    "another feature visible in figures [ cisw27 ] and [ cisw25 ] is that magnification changes the shape of @xmath119 with @xmath75 . the magnification term , being sensitive to structures at lower redshift , peaks at a lower @xmath75 than the galaxy term . for positive magnification contribution ,",
    "the peak of @xmath119 is at a lower @xmath75 than the peak of @xmath63 .    in figures [ wth27fig ] and [ wth25fig ]",
    "we plot the real space correlation functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 without the monopole and dipole contributions .",
    "these are calculated from @xmath122 where @xmath123 symbolizes @xmath124 or @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "we have extended the range of the sum to @xmath127 to insure the convergence of the sum for small values of @xmath128 .",
    "the general discussion about @xmath119 applies to @xmath129 as well ; at @xmath130 magnification bias grows to become an important component of the cross ",
    "correlation signal , and the amplitude is preferentially increased at large angular scales .",
    "magnification bias can of course have either sign . at low redshifts",
    ", one is generally looking at intrinsically faint galaxies which leads to a small @xmath47 that can be less than @xmath131 .",
    "this is why @xmath132 at low redshifts for our samples .",
    "the transition redshift from @xmath133 to @xmath134 is sample dependent . for a sample with an apparent limiting magnitude cut ,",
    "the brighter the cut , the lower the transition redshift .",
    "it is conceivable that a sufficiently faint cut can be achieved such that @xmath47 remains less than @xmath131 out to redshifts where @xmath135 .",
    "in such a case the net cross - correlation @xmath118 would become negative .",
    "this , however , requires an exceptionally deep survey : an i - band magnitude limit of 28 or higher , according to the observed luminosity function @xcite .",
    "conversely , if a sufficiently bright galaxy cut were used at low redshift it is possible that magnification could become important at lower redshifts than evidenced by our samples .    in the literature",
    "the cross ",
    "correlation signal is often presented in the normalized form @xmath136 or @xmath137 to remove the dependence on galaxy bias . however , when magnification bias is taken into account the auto ",
    "correlation is modified to be @xmath138 note , then , that the galaxy  bias would be completely removed by the division only if magnification bias were absent .",
    "had we plotted the normalized versions of the cross - correlation signals , the fractional difference between @xmath139 and @xmath140 would remain about the same as that between the un - normalized versions .",
    "this is because for the cases considered here @xmath141 to within about @xmath142 .",
    "clearly , magnification bias should be taken into account when interpreting isw measurements , especially at high redshifts where the magnification  temperature correlation actually dominates over the usual galaxy  temperature signal . ignoring it would lead to erroneous conclusions about dark energy .",
    "we quantify this by computing the estimation  bias in the dark energy equation of state @xmath143 if magnification were ignored when interpreting measurements from samples i and ii .",
    "a thought experiment is set up as follows .",
    "suppose the true dark energy equation of state is @xmath144 i.e. a cosmological constant ( and other cosmological parameters take the values stated at the end of  [ functions ] ) .",
    "suppose further one were to infer @xmath143 ( and other parameters ) from measurements of the total cross - correlation @xmath118 by fitting them with a model that ignores magnification i.e. @xmath70 , and one were to assign errorbars based on the ( erroneous ) model with no magnification .",
    "the fitted parameters include : the dark energy equation of state @xmath143 ( i.e. @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the dark energy pressure and energy density respectively ) , the matter density @xmath23 ( we assume a flat universe so that the dark energy density is @xmath148 ) , the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath149 , the spectral index @xmath150 , the hubble constant @xmath151 , the baryon density @xmath152 and the galaxy - bias for each redshift bin @xmath59 . constraints from other data ( such as from the temperature anisotropy itself @xmath69 and from the galaxy power spectrum ) are simulated by the inclusion of priors : the fractional ( 1 @xmath153 ) errors on @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath151 and @xmath149 are assumed to be @xmath156 , the fractional error on @xmath59 is @xmath157 , and @xmath150 has an ( absolute ) error of @xmath158 .",
    "these are similar to current constraints , depending somewhat on assumptions @xcite .",
    "a simple analytic expression can be derived for the parameter estimation  bias , which is discussed in detail in appendix a ( eq . [ [ wbias ] ] ) .",
    "the inferred @xmath143 , together with its marginalized error , for samples i and ii are shown in figure [ wbiasfig ] . the modes used range from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",
    "the solid symbols show the inferred @xmath143 from each redshift bin separately .",
    "the sign of the resulting estimation ",
    "bias is determined by the slope @xmath47 . if @xmath133 , as is the case at low redshifts , the inferred @xmath143 tends to be lower than the true value .",
    "this is understandable because the _ observed _ @xmath161 is suppressed by magnification in that case , and the only way to stick with an erroneous model without magnification is to resort to a lower @xmath143 to delay dark energy domination .",
    "the reverse happens at high redshifts , where @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , at the highest redshift bin , the bias can become quite large . ignoring magnification bias",
    "is simply unacceptable .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the errorbars are model dependent i.e. they are computed using the _ inferred _ model , which is different for each redshift bin .",
    "the general trend is for the errorbar to shrink as one goes to higher redshifts , despite the drop in signal  to  noise ( see  [ forecasts ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath162 rises with both @xmath1 and @xmath143 .",
    "the generally positive bias in @xmath143 at high redshifts helps to diminish the corresponding errorbars .    the dotted symbols at @xmath163 show the inferred @xmath143 and its associated errorbar when measurements from all the redshift bins are combined . the previous remarks on the model dependent nature of the errorbar applies here as well . in the case of sample ii",
    ", one finds that the overall inferred @xmath143 is biased high by almost 3 @xmath153 .",
    "the above considerations suggest that magnification could cause the signal  to  noise of isw measurements to remain favorable even at relatively high redshifts , deep into the matter dominated regime .",
    "this is borne out by figure [ dsn ] @xcite , which shows ( with @xmath164 divided out ) @xmath165 ^ 2 = \\sum_\\ell { [ c^{nt}_\\ell(z_i)]^2 f_{\\rm sky } ( 2\\ell + 1 ) \\over ( c^{nn}_\\ell(z_i , z_i ) + { 1 \\over n_i } ) c^{tt}_\\ell + [ c^{nt}_\\ell ( z_i)]^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the mean surface density of galaxies , and we include modes from @xmath159 to @xmath160 ( as in the rest of the paper ) .",
    "the result for sample ii is particularly striking : the signal  to  noise remains more or less flat out to high redshifts ( dotted line ) , in sharp contrast with the signal  to  noise if magnification is ignored ( solid line ; equivalent to putting @xmath166 , or replacing the superscript @xmath167 by @xmath168 in eq . [ [ binsn ] ] ) .",
    "magnification bias , therefore , opens up a high redshift window for isw measurements which otherwise would not exist .",
    "that is the good news . the bad news ,",
    "however , is that since the magnification of redshift @xmath36 galaxies probes structures at redshifts @xmath169 , the @xmath118 measurements at high redshifts are in fact quite correlated with those at low redshifts .",
    "taking into account such correlations , we show in figure [ sn ] the net accumulated signal  to  noise ( squared ) for measurements from all redshift bins up to a given @xmath170 , defined as follows : @xmath171 ^ 2=\\sum_{z_i , z_j \\le z_{\\rm max } } \\sum_{\\ell}c^{nt}_{\\ell}(z_i)\\left[\\textrm{cov}_{\\ell}^{-1}\\right]_{ij}c^{nt}_{\\ell}(z_j)\\ ] ] where @xmath172 _ { ij}=\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\\\ \\frac{(c^{nn}_{\\ell}(z_i , z_j)+\\delta_{ij}/n_i)c^{tt}_{\\ell}+c^{nt}_{\\ell}(z_i)c^{nt}_{\\ell}(z_j)}{f_{\\rm sky}(2\\ell+1)}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it appears the cumulative signal  to  noise reaches a plateau by @xmath173 whether or not magnification bias is included . as is expected , magnification bias makes much less of a difference in this case : the solid and dotted lines are very close together .",
    "this happens despite the significant difference in signal  to  noise on a redshift bin by redshift bin basis , shown in figure [ dsn ] .",
    "the culprit is the significant correlation between different redshift bins introduced by lensing  the high redshift measurements are in fact only probing large  scale structure at low redshifts .",
    "the reader might also wonder why the two samples have such similar cumulative signal  to  noise .",
    "this is because at low redshifts ( where most of the cumulative signal  to  noise comes from ) , neither sample is shot - noise dominated i.e. for the most part , the noise is dominated by the term associated with @xmath174 ( eq . [ [ covmat ] ] ) .    ultimately , we are interested in cosmological constraints from isw measurements on , for instance , the dark energy equation of state @xmath143 .",
    "it is therefore useful to show the expected errors for @xmath143 , both on a redshift bin by redshift bin basis ( as in figure [ dsn ] ) and on a cumulative basis ( as in figure [ sn ] ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is displayed in figures [ dwerr ] and [ werr ] .",
    "the fiducial cosmological model here , as is in the case of the computation of @xmath175 , is that described at the end of  [ functions ] .",
    "the cosmological parameters that are marginalized over and the set of priors assumed are identical to those described in ",
    "[ bias ] ( with the addition of @xmath60 , the number count slope for each redshift bin , as a new parameter , for which we impose a prior of @xmath176 ) , and the fisher matrix formalism for doing so is explained in appendix a , in particular eq .",
    "[ [ fprimen ] ] .",
    "once again , we see that while the presence of magnification bias improves the errors at high redshifts on a redshift bin by redshift bin basis , it does not in fact add much cumulative information if one considers the errors from combining redshift bins .",
    "we have experimented with changing the priors and varying sample definitions , and it appears this conclusion is quite robust .",
    "the most compelling reason for doing high redshift ( @xmath0 ) isw measurements is therefore not that the expected cumulative error on @xmath143 would continue to improve , but that there might be surprises e.g. dark energy might be quite different from the cosmological constant and actually remain a significant component of the universe even at high redshifts , or gravity may be modified in non - trivial ways on large scales @xcite . at the very least",
    ", high redshift isw measurements constitute a consistency check that one should make . as explained in  [ bias ]",
    ", such high redshift measurements should be interpreted with care : magnification bias must be taken into account .",
    "a natural question : to what extent should we worry about magnification bias when interpreting existing isw measurements ? this is partially addressed in figure [ wtgdata ] , which shows the cross - correlation signal at @xmath177 separation .",
    "the points with errorbars are measurements taken from a compilation in @xcite with the addition of recent results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all involve correlating the microwave background with galaxies , except the highest redshift one @xcite which involves correlation with quasars .",

    "the solid lines show the theoretical prediction for @xmath180 ( i.e. ignoring magnification ) adopting the cosmological parameters stated in  [ functions ] .",
    "because the selection function is somewhat uncertain , we choose to illustrate the prediction with a ` broad ' and a ` narrow ' selection function , parametrized as follows : @xmath181 } \\frac{z^{\\alpha}}{z_0^{\\alpha+1}}e^{-(z / z_0)^\\beta}.\\ ] ] where @xmath182 , @xmath183 is broad , and @xmath184 , @xmath185 is narrow . for each selection function @xmath186",
    "is adjusted to reproduce the median redshifts of the measurements .",
    "the dotted lines @xcite in figure [ wtgdata ] show the theoretical prediction for @xmath187 ( i.e. accounting for magnification ) for @xmath188 ( upper ) and @xmath189 ( lower ) .",
    "these values for the number count slope seem to span the range observed in quasar samples @xcite similar to the one used in the highest redshift isw measurement , where magnification bias is most relevant .",
    "considering all angular scales and both selection functions , we find that for the four lowest redshift measurements @xmath190 , unless @xmath191 or @xmath192 .",
    "for the nvss sample at @xmath193 , we estimate the slope of the nvss radio sample to be @xmath194 which results in @xmath195 .",
    "this is small compared with the measurement error .",
    "it appears that the quasar  temperature correlation at @xmath196 is the only measurement for which magnification _ could _ be significant . to determine precisely to",
    "what extent this measurement is affected by magnification requires a more detailed analysis of the quasar sample .",
    "it is conceivable that a suitably chosen quasar subsample could exhibit a large magnification effect .",
    "figure [ wtgdata ] also shows that for @xmath197 there is a significant dependence on the width of the selection function .",
    "this is because the mass  temperature correlation decreases rapidly with redshift .",
    "if a broad selection function is used , the galaxy  temperature correlation will decline less rapidly because low redshift sources will contribute . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath198 depends on the lensing weight function ( eq . [ [ lweight ] ] ) which is broadly distributed regardless of the width of the source distribution . in other words",
    ", changing the width of the selection function from broad to narrow causes the galaxy  temperature term to decrease , while leaving the magnification ",
    "temperature term largely unchanged .",
    "figure [ wtgdata ] illustrates this for a fixed @xmath128 , however , the statement holds for other angles .",
    "source distributions used in the existing isw measurements are probably closer to the broad selection function .    to conclude",
    ", we find that magnification bias alters the observed galaxy / quasar  temperature cross ",
    "correlation significantly at high redshifts ( figures [ cisw27 ] and [ cisw25 ] ) .",
    "the precise magnitude of the modification depends on the sample of objects under consideration .",
    "three facts more or less guarantee magnification plays a non  negligible or even dominant role at @xmath0 : the generally steepening slope of the number count at high redshifts ( because one is looking at intrinsically brighter objects ) , the decay of the intrinsic galaxy  temperature correlation @xmath117 as one enters the matter  dominated era , and the increase of the lensing efficiency with redshift .",
    "ignoring magnification bias when interpreting high redshift isw measurements would lead to erroneous conclusions about the nature of dark energy .",
    "for instance , the estimated equation of state @xmath143 can differ from the true one by more than 3 @xmath153 in some cases ( figure [ wbiasfig ] ) .",
    "the boosting of the isw signal by magnification ( assuming @xmath134 which is generally the case at high redshifts when one is looking at intrinsically bright objects ) implies that , despite naive expectations , isw measurements remain viable even at @xmath0 .",
    "however , because of the correlated nature of the lensing signal ( across different redshifts ) , the cumulative information from low @xmath1 s to high @xmath1 s is not significantly enhanced by magnification .",
    "the most compelling scientific justification for pursuing high redshift isw measurements is to look for surprises : for instance , dark energy might remain significant out to high redshifts . at the very least",
    ", one would like to perform a consistency check of the very successful cosmological constant model of dark energy .",
    "the large  scale nature of the isw signal also means it is a natural place to look for spatial fluctuations in dark energy @xcite and possible signatures of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "when interpreting future high redshift isw measurements , accounting for the effect of magnification bias is a must .",
    "the net cross  correlation signal depends not only on the cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath23 , @xmath199 , @xmath151 , @xmath150 , @xmath149 ) but also on the sample  dependent parameters @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "the slope @xmath47 can be estimated from the observed number counts .",
    "the bias @xmath48 can be inferred by comparing the amplitude of the galaxy / quasar auto  correlation with the amplitude of the mass auto ",
    "correlation predicted by the microwave background , modulo the fact that the observed galaxy / quasar auto  correlation function is itself affected by magnification bias ( though it appears to be at most a @xmath142 effect at the scales and redshifts we study ) .",
    "alternatively , the bias can be estimated by examining the galaxy / quasar higher order correlations .",
    "the upshot is that separating the galaxy  temperature and the magnification ",
    "temperature signals is in principle possible , at least in a model dependent manner .",
    "other possibilities are to exploit the sample  dependent nature of @xmath48 and @xmath47 to study the variation of the total isw signal with different sample cuts , or to use the galaxy  galaxy correlation across different redshift bins to check for consistency with the isw  magnification bias signal .",
    "an interesting question remains to be explored : given a survey with many different kinds of objects , such as galaxies / quasars of different luminosities and types , how should one go about choosing a weighting scheme that optimizes the total signal and/or its magnification component ?",
    "the magnification component might be particularly interesting if the galaxy / quasar bias turns out to be uncertain .",
    "we leave this for future investigation .",
    "we would like to thank ryan scranton for useful discussions regarding magnification bias , asantha cooray for addressing questions we had about his results on the conditional luminosity function , elena zucca for kindly sending us her group s results on the luminosity function for several galaxy types ( see @xcite ) , and ben johnson for helpful discussions regarding luminosity functions and galaxy samples .",

    "what seems to be less often discussed is the issue of predicting the bias : what is the resulting bias in the estimation of a parameter if some particular physical effect is ignored or some approximation is made in modeling the data ? in our case , the parameter of interest is @xmath143 and the physical effect is the magnification bias .",

    "for instance , one could choose to ignore certain physical effects , such as magnification bias , in constructing these quantities .",

    "this means @xmath228 and the weights @xmath227 are all computed by ignoring this effect , whereas @xmath231 , which is the expectation value of the observed data , of course has such a physical effect ( and all other relevant physical effects ) taken into account . the preceding argument ( concerning the _ exact _ model ) no longer works and one is left with an estimation bias i.e. @xmath232 .",
    "note that this bias depends on the assumed fiducial parameter value @xmath209 ( as opposed to the case of unbiased estimation , where @xmath233 does not depend on @xmath209 at all ) . generally , a modeler would choose a fiducial value that is close to the _ perceived _",
