    "since casimir s pioneering work in 1948 many advancements have taken place in the field of casimir force theory and its experimental confirmation .",
    "casimir s original work described the force that operates between uncharged parallel conductors arising from the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the theory has since been extended to isotropic dielectrics@xcite and anisotropic materials@xcite .",
    "work in related fields@xcite may require further generalization leading to new and interesting results .",
    "experimentation in the field began in the 1950 s with the efforts of overbeek and sparnaay@xcite and of derjaguin and abrikosova@xcite and has continued to the present day with ever increasing precision@xcite , covering a wide range of separations from @xmath0 .",
    "however , 63 years after the birth of this field of study , many problems still remain .",
    "these problems include the modelling of material properties , the effects of temperature , and the approach to complex geometries among others .",
    "in addition to these out - standing problems , there exists another problem : the lack of a common approach . from mode",
    "counting methods to green s functions to stress - energy tensor formalisms , each constitutes a unique method for calculating the casimir force using exclusive nomenclature leading to unique interpretations of the phenomenon .",
    "although most of these approaches yield the same or similiar predictions , it is often difficult to know exactly how to use any particular formalism to solve a new problem or assess the domain of its applicability . in an effort to redress this issue a number of excellent books",
    "have been written that detail many of these approaches @xcite .",
    "herein we develop an approach that covers a wide - range of casimir problems and we hope to describe it in detail so as to be easily adapted to new problems .    in this paper",
    "we will calculate the casimir force using a scattering approach and subsequent mode counting method .",
    "our basic formalism is not specific to any geometry or boundary conditions ; we simply assume that we have two interacting boundaries as shown below and note that the right - bound waves in the cavity are generated by reflections of all the left - bound waves off the surface @xmath1 and vice - versa .    ,",
    "width=240 ]    the amplitude of the right - bound wave and left - bound wave at points @xmath2 and @xmath3 on surfaces @xmath1 and @xmath4 respectively are related by a generalized huygen s principle , namely , that the amplitude of any polarization state at a particular location is given by the sum of all incident wavelets added up in a phase sensitive manner : @xmath5 @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9 reflection matrices with dimension equal to the number of polarization states of the field under consideration ( for the electro - magnetic field these are 2x2 matrices ) and @xmath10 equals the gradient of the green s function .",
    "specifically , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , hereafter referred to as the transport functions or transport matrix , encodes only the phase changes and @xmath13 encodes only the modulus changes suffered by the wavelet during transport from some point @xmath14 to some other point @xmath15 .",

    "thus the only non - trivial solutions to equation [ eigen1 ] is : @xmath20    equation [ delta ] represents a system of equations whereby a non - trivial solution exists if and only if , @xmath21 an eigenmode of the cavity exists for any choice of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 which can satisfy equation [ det ] .    in order to calculate the casimir interaction",
    "energy one must sum over the energies of all such eigenmodes , a task most easily performed by utilizing the argument principle : @xmath24\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath25 .",
    "the transport functions , @xmath12 , have elements proportional to @xmath26 , making the above integral oscillatory . to deal with this",
    "we can perform a change of variables , @xmath27 .",
    "all the elements of @xmath12 will then be proportional to exponentially decaying functions and consequently the integral over the semicircle @xmath28 goes to zero . after integrating by parts the expression for the energy carried by all the modes in the cavity",
    "is given by : @xmath29 where the sum is over all unobstructed straight line paths connecting the two surfaces .",
    "in this section we will demonstrate how to use this approach by solving a few specific cases and showing that this approach yields results consistent with past works .",
    "we will start with the simplest case , the casimir case described by a parallel - plate cavity of infinite lateral extent @xmath30 and finite spacing @xmath31 , the walls of which are perfect conductors , @xmath32 .",
    "the cavity itself is empty with @xmath33 , a fact that allows us to say the transport functions are diagonal ( no polarization mixing upon transport ) .",
    "moreover , the transport of an eigenmode across the cavity is invariant under the change of polarization , this allows us to write the transport functions as : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the vector between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . from this",
    "we can write equation [ e ] as : @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the left and right bound wave vectors , respectively and the @xmath39 and @xmath40 integrals are a symbolic representation of the sum over all the connecting paths .",
    "we can express the integrand in a different form by noting that for any @xmath41 matrix , @xmath42 , the following is true : @xmath43 using equation [ det2 ] and the definitions of the wave - vectors we can rewrite equation [ e2 ] as : @xmath44 here we have written @xmath45 as the energy per unit area in order to eliminate the integral over @xmath40 which symbolically represents an area integration the details of which will be addressed in the next section of this paper .",
    "we can directly evaluate the above equation by expressing the natural log as a series and performing the integration term by term : @xmath46 here we have performed a change of variables : @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the integration over @xmath49 can be carried out quickly to give a value of 1 .",
    "the lower limit of integration of @xmath50 has been written as @xmath51 to eliminate any controversy over expanding the natural log around a discontinuity . integrating over @xmath50 by parts and taking the limit as @xmath52 yields @xmath53 ,",
    "so that : @xmath54 the sum in the above expression is well known and has a definite value of @xmath55 .",
    "this yields the value for the energy per unit area : @xmath56 in conformity with the standard casimir result@xcite .",
    "in the last section we calculated the casimir energy per unit area of a parallel - plate cavity of infinite extent .",
    "although this is an interesting result it is only applicable under the condition that the separation of the plates is much less than the size of the plates .",
    "below we calculate the casimir energy per unit area of a cavity of finite size .    for simplicity let us once again consider the case of a perfectly conducting parallel - plate cavity .",
    "this time however the side - walls will only occupy the region @xmath57 in the x- and y - directions .",

    "[ casimir ] simply multiplied by the area of plate 1 , the solid line was calculated using our expression eq .",
    "[ plates ] . from figure [ finite2 ]",
    "it is apparent that for cavities with lateral dimension much larger than their separation ( @xmath65 ) our expression approaches casimir s expression , however for separations larger than the side - length ( @xmath66 ) our expression begins to drop off quicker than casimir s expression .",
    "this behaviour is to be expected , as the plates should begin to appear as points rather than planes for large separation , leading to an additional @xmath67 behaviour .",
    "an interesting case is that of a parallel - plate cavity with uniaxial boundary conditions as illustrated in figure [ schematic2 ] .",
    "such a cavity would have side - walls made of a uniaxial material , for example a wire grid polarizer or a graphite crystal cut with in - plane optical anisotropy .",
    "when two such plates are placed close together with their optic axes rotated by an angle @xmath68 with respect to each other , both an orientationally dependent normal force and a torque tending to align the optic axes of the plates have been predicted @xcite@xcite@xcite .    ,",
    "width=384 ]    in order to address this casimir problem in the formalism presented in this paper , let us start with equation [ e ] relevant to a parallel - plate cavity of infinite extent :    @xmath69    we need only to define @xmath7 and @xmath8 and proceed as before . in order to multiply them is this fashion these reflection matrices need to be in the same basis .",
    "we will write our reflection matrices in the te - tm basis .",
    "fortunately for all parallel - plate cavities the basis vectors that define the te - tm basis for a given wave - vector on one surface are the same as for the other surface . thus @xmath7 and @xmath8 will automatically be in the same basis .",
    "were this not the case we would write @xmath70 , where @xmath71 refers to the reflection matrix in a local coordinate basis .",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 refer to a local and global basis and @xmath74 indicates a change of basis matrix which could be a function of position .",
    "the reflection matrices are 2x2 matrices the elements of which describe transition amplitudes between the polarization states of the incident and reflected waves .",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the reflection matrices of plates 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "the functional definition of these matrices is to describe the reflected wave in terms of the incident wave .",
    "so , if we let @xmath76 represent an incident transverse electric wave with unit amplitude , we can write the reflected wave as @xmath77 .    in order to obtain an explicit expression for the matrices",
    "we must find the general solution for a wave in each of the three regions ( the interior of the cavity and inside plates 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we then have to match up these solutions with maxwell s equations providing the boundary conditions . in the region between the plates ( region 3 )",
    "the general solution of maxwell s equations is a linear combination of transverse plane waves described by an angular frequency @xmath22 , wave vector @xmath23 , and polarization unit vector @xmath78 . for any choice of @xmath22 we can write the solution as the sum of forward and backward travelling waves , each of which have two independent polarizations . thus the solution for",
    "any of @xmath22 will be the sum of four waves , written in terms of the vector potential as : @xmath79 in the above equation @xmath80 is the amplitude of the @xmath81 wave .",
    "the polarization and wave vectors can be written explicitly as : @xmath82 in the above equations @xmath83 is the magnitude of the component of @xmath23 perpendicular to the z - axis and @xmath84 where we have performed a scaled wick rotation as before , @xmath27 .",
    "the general solutions in the interior of plates 1 and 2 ( regions 1 and 2 , respectively)@xcite are similar but given in terms of a linear combination of ordinary and extraordinary waves denoted by the subscripts @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in contrast with region 3 , the solutions in region 1 and 2 will have two waves each instead of four because we assume regions 1 and 2 to extend to infinity thereby eliminating any inbound waves . the solutions in region 1 and 2",
    "are then : @xmath87 it s well known that the tangential components of the wave vector are left unchanged by refraction and as such , only the normal component of the wave vectors and the three components of the polarization vectors in the above expression need to be worked out explicitly .",
