    "the aim of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we review recent developments in the study of low - dimensional models with the so - called _ correlated disorder_. by this term we mean specific long - range correlations embedded in random potentials , that lead to anomalous transport properties .",
    "second , we observe new results obtained for one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi-1d structures with the corrugated surfaces resulting in _ surface scattering_. in the latter problem , we also consider the case when surface profiles , although described by random functions , contain the long - range correlations along the profiles .",
    "recently , the problem of anomalous transport in 1d systems with correlated disorder has attracted much attention .",
    "for the theory of disordered systems , the fundamental significance of this problem is due to exciting results that revise a commonly accepted belief that any randomness in long 1d structures results in the anderson localization . from the experimental viewpoint ,",
    "many of the results may have a strong impact for the creation of a new class of electron nanodevices , optic fibers , acoustic and electromagnetic waveguides with selective transport properties .",
    "as was shown @xcite , specific long - range correlations in random potentials can give rise to an appearance of the _ mobility edges _ for 1d finite structures .",
    "specifically , an interval of electron energy ( or wave frequency ) arises on one side of the mobility edge where the eigenstates turn out to be extended , in contrast to the other side where the eigenstates remain to be exponentially localized .",
    "the position and the width of the windows of transparency can be controlled by the form of the binary correlator of a scattering potential .",
    "a quite simple method was used for constructing random potentials that result in any predefined energy / frequency window of a perfect transparency .",
    "the predictions of the theory have been verified experimentally @xcite by studying transport properties of a single - mode electromagnetic waveguide with point - like scatters .",
    "the latter were intentionally inserted into the waveguide in order to provide random potential with a given binary correlator . in the experiment ,",
    "the disorder was created by the array of 500 screws with random heights obtained numerically in accordance with the analytical expressions .",
    "the single - mode regime was provided within the frequency range @xmath0 ghz .",
    "the agreement between experimental and numerical data was found to be unexpectedly good . in particular , the predicted windows of a complete reflection alternated by those of a good transparency , were clearly observed , in spite of many experimental imperfections .",
    "main results on the anomalous transport and mobility edges are based on a new transfer matrix approach @xcite that was found to be quite effective in the study of localization properties of eigenstates in 1d geometry .",
    "this approach established a direct relevance of the anderson localization to the parametric instability of classical linear oscillators with white and colored noise @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "the role of long - range correlations has been substantially studied in 1d discrete tight - binding models of the anderson and kronig - penney types @xcite .",
    "a further development of the theory is due to its application to the surface scattering of electromagnetic waves ( or electrons ) in quasi-1d guiding systems .",
    "the problem of wave propagation ( both classical and quantum ) through such systems with corrugated surfaces has a quite long history and till now remains a hot topic in the literature .",
    "this problem naturally arises in the analysis of spectral and transport properties of optics fibers , acoustic and radio waveguides , remote sensing , shallow water waves , multilayered systems and photonic lattices , etc . @xcite . also , similar problems arise when describing the spectral and transport properties of quantum quasi - particles in thin metal films and semiconductor nanostructures , such as nanowires and strips , superlattices and quantum - well - systems @xcite .    as is well established , the scattering from corrugated surfaces results in the classical and quantum diffusive transport @xcite , as well as in the effects of strong electron / wave localization @xcite . correspondingly , the eigenstates of periodic systems with corrugated surfaces turn out to have a chaotic structure @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies of quasi-1d surface - disordered systems @xcite have revealed a principal difference from those known in the standard models with _ bulk _ random potentials @xcite . specifically , it was found that transport properties of quasi-1d waveguides with rough surfaces essentially depend on many characteristic lengths , in contrast to the bulk scattering where the _ one - parameter scaling _ occurs . according to this remarkable scaling",
    ", all scattering properties of finite samples with bulk disorder are determined by the ratio of the localization length found for infinite systems , to the size of the samples .",
    "the situation for the surface scattering in quasi-1d structures is principally different due to a non - isotropic character of surface scattering in the `` channel space '' . in particular",
    ", the transmission coefficient for the surface scattering substantially decreases with an increase of the angle of incoming waves .",
    "one should stress that main results in the theory of surface scattering were obtained for random surfaces with fast - decaying correlations along the structures .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to explore the role of specific long - range correlations in surface profiles , having in mind the results found for the 1d systems with the correlated disorder .",
    "apart from the theoretical interest , this problem can find many applications since existing experimental technics allow for the construction of systems with sophisticated surfaces and bulk - scattering potentials resulting in anomalous transport properties @xcite .    for single - mode waveguides with the surface scattering",
    "the problem turns out to be equivalent to the 1d bulk scattering . for this reason",
    ", the methods and results obtained for the latter case can be directly applied for the waveguides @xcite .",
    "specifically it was shown , both analytically and by direct numerical simulations , that single - mode waveguides with a desired selective transport can be fabricated by a proper construction of long - range - correlated random surfaces .",
    "much more tricky situation arises in the multi - mode waveguides @xcite .",
    "as was shown , in this case the long - range correlations , on the one hand , give rise to a suppression of the interaction between different propagating waveguide modes . on the other hand",
    ", the same correlations can provide a perfect transparency of each independent channel , similar to what happens in the 1d geometry .",
    "the number of independent transparent modes is governed by the correlation length and can be as large as the total number of propagating modes .",
    "therefore , the transmission through waveguide can be significantly enhanced in comparison with the case of uncorrelated surface roughness .",
    "the important point is that for the multi - mode surface scattering there are many scattering lengths and the one - parameter scaling is not valid . as a result",
    ", the transport through different channels can be separated by a proper choice of long - range correlations .",
    "thus , the intra - mode transitions from ballistic to diffusive or localized regime are expected to be sharp enough in order to observe the corresponding mobility edges experimentally .    in order to understand the impact of long - range correlations in quasi-1d geometry , we have also discussed the anomalous transport and mobility edges in waveguides with another kind of disorder , the so - called , _ stratified _ or _ layered disorder",
    "_ @xcite . in spite of apparent simplicity of this model ,",
    "the results turn out to be quite instructive .",
    "this model describes the scattering of classical waves or electrons through quasi-1d structures with a disorder that depends on the longitudinal coordinate only .",
    "therefore , it absorbs both the properties of 1d correlated structures and those that are specific for quasi-1d systems with the surface scattering . on the one hand ,",
    "the transport through any of open channels is independent from the others . on the other hand ,",
    "since the localization length in each channel strongly depends on its number , the total transmittance is a complicated combination of the partial 1d transmittances . as a result",
    ", the effect of long - range correlations in such a model turns out to be highly non - trivial , leading to quite unexpected phenomena .",
    "in particular , it is shown that with a proper choice of the binary correlator one can arrange the situation when some of the channels are completely transparent and the others are closed .",
    "this interplay between localized and transparent channels gives rise to the effect of a _ non - monotonic _ step - wise dependence of the transmittance on the wave number .",
    "the results may find practical applications for fabrication of electromagnetic / acoustic waveguides , optic fibers and electron nano - conductors that reveal non - conventional selective transport .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in next section 2 , the 1d model with a random potential",
    "is introduced , for which the main expressions for the transmission coefficient of finite samples are given . with the use of these expressions ,",
    "we discuss the notion of the single parameter scaling , as well as the role of long - range correlations for the anomalous transport . in section 3 the quasi-1d model with a stratified disorder",
    "is considered in detail .",
    "first , it is shown that in this model an hierarchy of characteristic scattering lengths arises resulting in a coexistence of ballistic , diffusive and localized regimes .",
    "we shown how this effect gives rise to unexpected transport properties for the potentials with specific long - range correlations . in order to demonstrate these effects ,",
    "a simple example is analyzed demonstrating a highly non - trivial dependence of the transmittance on the energy of incident waves .",
    "next section 4 is devoted to the scattering through guiding systems with corrugated surfaces .",
    "in the particular case of a single - mode waveguides , the analysis of surface scattering is shown to be analogous to the bulk scattering in 1d structures . using this analogy ,",
    "we show how to construct long - range correlations along the scattering profiles , in order to observe the windows of a complete transparency alternated by the regions of a complete reflection .",
    "the analytical results are demonstrated by a direct numerical computation of the localization length for the reconstructed potential with a given two - point correlator .",
    "finally , in the same section the study of a multi - mode waveguide with correlated surface profiles is performed , taking as an example the potential with the step - function for the roughness power spectrum of a disorder .",
    "it is shown that this kind of the correlations may lead to a fractional dependence of the transmission coefficient on the normalized wave vector of incoming waves .",
    "let us start with the stationary one - dimensional schrdinger ( or wave ) equation @xmath1\\psi(x)=0\\ ] ] with the wave number @xmath2 equal to @xmath3 for a classical scalar wave of frequency @xmath4 , or to the fermi wave number for electrons within the isotropic fermi - liquid model .",
    "the static potential @xmath5 for electromagnetic waves is given by @xmath6 with the dielectric constant @xmath7 .",

    "the binary ( two - point ) correlator @xmath12 is normalized to @xmath13 at @xmath14 , and is assumed to decrease with increasing the distance @xmath15 .",
    "obviously , a statistical treatment is meaningful if the scale of decrease of the correlator @xmath16 is much less than the sample length @xmath17 .",
    "note that the random potential @xmath5 is the only source of electron / wave scattering in the considered model .    in what follows we consider weak over - barrier scattering , @xmath18 , for which appropriate perturbative approaches can be used . in this case",
    "all transport properties are entirely determined by the _ randomness power spectrum _",

    "the condition @xmath13 results in the following normalization for @xmath19 , @xmath23    we shall characterize the transport properties of finite open systems by the wave _ transmittance _ or , the same , by the electron _ dimensionless conductance _ @xmath24 . in the case of the electron transport , @xmath24 is defined as the conductance @xmath25 in units of @xmath26 , @xmath27 the transmittance @xmath24 for our model ( [ 1dschr - eq ] )  ( [ t - def ] ) can be found with the use of well developed methods , such as , e.g. , the perturbative diagrammatic technique of berezinski @xcite , the invariant imbedding method @xcite , or the two - scale approach @xcite .",
    "all the methods allow to take adequately into account the effects of coherent multiple electron / wave scattering giving rise to the anderson localization .",

    "the inverse value @xmath34 can be determined via the lyapunov exponent of the corresponding averaged wave function @xmath35 within the transfer matrix approach .",
    "such a dependence of the transport properties on the ratio @xmath31 manifests a principal concept of _ one - parameter scaling _ that constitutes the phenomenon of the 1d anderson localization .    from equation  ( [ < 1d - ts > ] )",
    "one can find relatively easy the low moments of the distribution of the transmittance @xmath24 . specifically , at @xmath36 one obtains the average dimensionless resistance @xmath37 .",

    "the average transmittance ( dimensionless conductance ) @xmath39 is described by equation  ( [ < 1d - ts > ] ) with @xmath40 , leading to the following expression , @xmath41 & & \\times\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{z^2dz}{\\cosh z } \\exp\\left(-z^2\\frac{l_{loc}}{2l}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for the second moments , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , they define the variance of the conductance and resistance , respectively .",
    "one can see that the average resistance does not coincide with the inverse value of the average conductance , @xmath44 .",
    "also , from equation  ( [ < 1d - ts > ] ) one can find that at @xmath45 , the variance of the resistance and conductance is of the order of their squared average values themselves .",
    "this fact means that in this case both the conductance and resistance are not self - averaged quantities .",
    "hence , by changing the length @xmath17 of the sample , or the disorder itself for the same @xmath17 , one should expect large fluctuations of the conductance and resistance .",
    "this type of fluctuations are known as the _ mesoscopic fluctuations _ which are characteristic of strong quantum effects on the macroscopic scale .    in order to properly characterize the transport properties of samples with exponentially small conductance",
    ", one should refer to the self - average logarithm of the conductance , @xmath46 this result shows an exponential decrease of the transmittance for the so - called representative ( non - resonant ) realizations of the random potential @xcite .",
    "note that this expression can serve as the definition of the localization length @xmath32 itself , which is complimentary to the definition of @xmath32 through the lyapunov exponent in the transfer matrix method .",
    "in accordance with the one parameter scaling concept , there are only _ two transport regimes _ in the 1d disordered structures , the regimes of the ballistic and localized transport .    *",

    "the average transmittance is exponentially small , @xmath48 & & \\mbox{for}\\qquad l_{loc}\\ll l.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can see , in the localization regime a 1d disordered system almost perfectly ( with an exponential accuracy ) reflects the electrons ( or waves ) due to a",
    "_ strong localization _ of all eigenstates .",
    "the expressions ( [ < 1d - ts > ] )  ( [ 1d - tloc ] ) are universal and applicable for any one - dimensional system with a _ weak static disorder_. as one can see , in order to describe transport properties of finite sample , one needs to know the localization length @xmath32 which is a characteristic of the anderson localization occurring in infinite samples . according to different approaches @xcite , the inverse localization length for any kind of weak disorder",
    "is determined by the @xmath49-harmonic in the randomness power spectrum @xmath19 of the scattering potential @xmath5 , @xmath50 this canonical expression indicates that all features of the electron / wave transmission through the 1d disordered media depend on the two - point correlations in the random scattering potential .",
    "therefore , if the power spectrum @xmath51 is very small or vanishes within some interval of the wave number @xmath2 , the localization length @xmath32 turns out to be very large ( @xmath52 ) or even diverges .",
    "evidently , the localization effects can be neglected in this case , and the conductor even of a large length should be almost fully transparent .",
    "this means that , in principle , by a proper choice of the disorder one can design the disordered structures with selective ( _ anomalous _ ) ballistic transport within a prescribed range of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the important practical problem arises of how to construct such a random potential @xmath5 from a prescribed power spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "this problem can be solved by a direct generalization of the method developed in the references  @xcite for discrete 1d models with random potentials . in our case of the _ continuous _ random potential @xmath5 , the solution of the problem is as follows .",
    "first , starting from a given form of the power spectrum @xmath19 , one should obtain the function @xmath53 whose fourier transform is @xmath54 , @xmath55 after this , the random profile of the scattering potential @xmath5 can be generated as a convolution of a delta - correlated random process @xmath56 with the function @xmath53 , @xmath57 here , the `` white noise '' @xmath56 is determined by the standard properties , @xmath58 and can be easily created with the use of random number generators .    the above expressions allow us to solve the inverse scattering problem of constructing random potentials from their power spectrum .",
    "note that this construction is possible in the case of a weak disorder only .",
    "that is why only the binary correlator is involved in the reconstruction of @xmath5 while the higher correlators do not contribute .",
    "note also that the potential obtained by the proposed method is not unique .",
    "indeed , there is an infinite set of delta - correlated random processes @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , substituting them into the definition ( [ v - beta ] ) , we come to an infinite number of random potential profiles with a given power spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "the important point in this approach is that one can arrange a very _ sharp transition _ between ballistic and localized regimes of electron / wave transport at any prescribed one or more points on @xmath2-axis .",
    "it is clear that in this case the power spectrum @xmath19 must abruptly vanish at the prescribed points .",
    "this means that the binary correlator @xmath12 has to be a slowly decaying function of the distance @xmath59 . in other words , random scattering potentials @xmath5",
    "that give rise to the combination of ballistic and localized transport windows should be of specific form with long - range correlations along the structure .",
    "because of an abrupt character , the transition points can be regarded as _ mobility edges_.",
    "let us now demonstrate the suggested approach of constructing the potentials giving rise in the mobility edges . for this , we consider the power spectrum of the following rectangular form @xmath60 & = & \\frac{\\pi}{2(k_+-k_-)}\\left[\\theta(2k_+-|k_x|)- \\theta(2k_--|k_x|)\\right],\\label{wod - ftw}\\\\[6pt ] & & k_+>k_->0.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath61 is the heaviside unit - step function , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the characteristic wave numbers @xmath64 are the correlation parameters to be specified .",
    "note that such a power spectrum was recently employed to create a special rough surface for the experimental study of an enhanced backscattering @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was used in the theoretical analysis of light scattering from amplifying media @xcite , as well as of the localization of surface plasmon polaritons on random surfaces @xcite .",
    "according to equation  ( [ fr - w ] ) the binary correlator @xmath65 corresponding to the expression ( [ wod - ftw ] ) , has the following form , @xmath66 in equations  ( [ wod - ftw ] ) and ( [ wod - w ] ) the factor @xmath67 stands to provide the normalization requirement ( [ w - norm ] ) , or the same , @xmath13 .    following the suggested recipe ( [ beta - def ] )  ( [ zcorr ] )",
    ", one can construct the scattering potential @xmath5 with the above correlation properties , @xmath68 one should stress that the potential ( [ v - wod ] ) with the binary correlator ( [ wod - w ] ) and power spectrum ( [ wod - ftw ] ) is substantially different from the widely used delta - correlated noise , or random processes with fast - decaying gaussian correlations . here , the potential ( [ v - wod ] ) is specified by two variation parameters , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and has long tales in the expression for the two - point correlator ( [ wod - w ] ) .",
    "the existence of such tales manifests the long - range correlations in the potential , originated from the step - wise discontinuities at the points @xmath71 in its power spectrum ( [ wod - ftw ] ) .    from equations ( [ 1d - lloc ] ) and ( [ wod - ftw ] ) one can find the inverse localization length , @xmath72 as one can see , there are two mobility edges at the points @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the localization length @xmath75 diverges below the first point , @xmath73 , and above the second one , @xmath74 . between these points , for @xmath76 , the localization length ( [ lloc - wod ] ) has finite value and smoothly increases with an increase of wave number @xmath2 .",
    "let us now choose the parameters for which the regime of a strong localization occurs at the upper transition point @xmath74 .",
    "this automatically provides the strong localization within the whole interval @xmath76 .",
    "the condition of such situation reads as @xmath77 as a result , there are two regions of transparency for the samples of finite length @xmath17 with the chosen random potentials . between these regions",
    "the average transmittance @xmath28 is exponentially small according to the expression ( [ 1d - tloc ] ) . due to this fact",
    ", the system exhibits the localized transport within the interval @xmath76 and the ballistic regime with @xmath78 outside this interval . in the experiment one can observe that with an increase of the wave number @xmath2 , the perfect transparency below @xmath73 abruptly alternates with a complete reflection , and recovers at @xmath74 . from equations  ( [ lloc - wod ] ) and ( [ loctr - wod ] )",
    "one can see that the smaller value @xmath79 of the reflecting region the smaller the length @xmath75 and , consequently , the stronger is the localization within this region .",
    "this remarkable fact may find important applications in creating a new class of random narrow - band filters or reflectors .",
    "now we extend our study of the correlated disorder to the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) systems . to this end",
    ", we consider a plane waveguide ( or conducting electron wire ) of width @xmath80 , stretched along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the @xmath81-axis is directed in transverse to the waveguide direction so that one ( lower ) edge of the waveguide is @xmath82 and the other ( upper ) edge is @xmath83 .",
    "the waveguide is assumed to have a _ stratified _ disorder inside the finite region @xmath84 of length @xmath17 , which depends on @xmath21 only .",
    "thus , the scattering is confined within a region of the @xmath85-plane defined by @xmath86 as a physically plausible model for stratified disorder , we shall employ the statistically homogeneous and isotropic random potential @xmath5 with the correlation properties ( [ v - cor ] )  ( [ w - norm ] ) .",
    "one should note that in this case the scale of a decrease of the binary correlator @xmath16 is of the order of the characteristic scale of stratification .",
    "the wave function obeys the two - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath87\\psi(x , z)=0.\\ ] ] this equation is complemented by zero dirichlet boundary conditions on both walls of the waveguide , @xmath88 .",
    "since the scattering potential @xmath5 depends only on the lengthwise coordinate @xmath21 , the waveguide eigenfunction @xmath89 is naturally presented in the canonical form of the normal waveguide modes , @xmath90 its longitudinal mode - component @xmath91 is governed by the quasi - one - dimensional wave equation that directly follows from equations  ( [ 2dschr - eq ] ) and ( [ 2d - nwm ] ) , @xmath92\\psi_n(x)=0.\\ ] ] here the wave number @xmath93 is a quantum value of the lengthwise wave number @xmath22 for @xmath94-th waveguide mode , @xmath95 evidently , the transport properties are contributed only by those waveguide modes that can propagate along the structure ( along @xmath21-axis ) , i.e. have real value of @xmath93 .",
    "these propagating modes occupy the so - called conducting channels . as follows from equation  ( [ kn ] ) ,",
    "the total number @xmath96 of propagating modes is equal to the integer part @xmath97 $ ] of the ratio @xmath98 , @xmath99.\\ ] ] the waveguide modes with the indices @xmath100 corresponding to imaginary values of @xmath93 and not contributing to the electron / wave transmission , are called the evanescent modes .    from the wave equation ( [ q1dschr - eq ] )",
    "one can see that since the stratified disorder does not depend on @xmath81 , there is no coupling between the propagating modes .",
    "therefore , the stratified wire represents a set of 1d non - interacting conducting channels .",
    "that is why , in full accordance with the landauer s",
    "concept @xcite , the total transmittance @xmath24 of the stratified waveguide can be expressed as a sum of independent partial transmittances @xmath101 corresponding to every @xmath94-th propagating mode , @xmath102    in such a way we have reduced the transport problem for the quasi-1d disordered system to the consideration of the transport through a number of 1d structures with the random potential @xmath5 .",
    "the scattering inside every of these structures is described by equation  ( [ q1dschr - eq ] ) , and is entirely consistent with the phenomenon of the 1d anderson localization .",
    "specifically , the average mode - transmittance @xmath103 is described by the universal expressions ( [ < 1d - ts > ] )  ( [ 1d - tloc ] ) .",
    "the _ mode localization length _",
    "@xmath104 , associated with a specific @xmath94-th channel , is determined by equation  ( [ 1d - lloc ] ) in which the total wave number @xmath2 should be replaced by the lengthwise wave number @xmath93 , @xmath105 thus , the partial transport in each @xmath94-th conducting channel obeys the concept of the _ one - parameter scaling_. in particular , for @xmath106 , the average transmittance @xmath103 exhibits the ballistic behavior and the corresponding @xmath94-th normal mode is practically transparent , see equation  ( [ 1d - tbal ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the transmittance @xmath103 is exponentially small in line with equation  ( [ 1d - tloc ] ) , when the mode localization length is much less than the length of the waveguide , @xmath107 .",
    "this implies strong electron / wave localization in the @xmath94-th channel .",
    "the main feature of the mode localization length @xmath104 is its rather strong dependence on the channel index @xmath94 .",
    "one can see from equation  ( [ nmode - lloc ] ) that the larger @xmath94 is , the smaller is the mode localization length @xmath104 and , consequently , the stronger is the coherent scattering within this mode .",
    "this strong dependence is due to the squared wave number @xmath93 in the denominator of equation  ( [ nmode - lloc ] ) .",
    "evidently , with an increase of the mode index @xmath94 the value of @xmath93 decreases .",
    "an additional dependence appears because of the stratification power spectrum @xmath108 . since the binary correlator @xmath16 of the random stratification is a decreasing function of @xmath109 , the numerator @xmath108 increases with @xmath94 ( note that it is a constant for the delta - correlated stratification only ) .",
    "therefore , both the numerator and denominator contribute in the same direction for the dependence of @xmath104 on @xmath94 . as a result",
    ", we arrive at the hierarchy of mode localization lengths , @xmath110 the smallest mode localization length @xmath111 belongs to the highest ( last ) channel with the mode index @xmath112 , while the largest mode localization length @xmath113 corresponds to the lowest ( first ) channel with @xmath114 . note that similar hierarchy was also found in the references  @xcite for the attenuations lengths in the model of quasi-1d waveguides with rough surfaces .",
    "thus , a remarkable phenomenon arises . on the one hand",
    ", the concept of the one - parameter scaling holds for any of @xmath96 conducting channels whose partial transport is characterized solely by the ratio @xmath115 . on the other hand , this concept turns out to be broken for the total waveguide transport . indeed , due to the revealed hierarchy ( [ modelloc - hierarchy ] ) of the mode localization lengths @xmath104 , the total average transmittance ( [ q1d - t - tot ] ) depends on the whole set of scaling parameters @xmath115 .",

    "the sum over @xmath230 in the expression  ( [ sd - mm - lnf ] ) for the inverse forward scattering length contains only diagonal term with @xmath243 which describes direct intra - mode scattering _ inside _ the channels .",
    "moreover , each term in the sum of equation  ( [ sd - mm - lnb ] ) for the inverse backscattering length is equal to zero . as a result , the following interesting properties arise .    *",
    "( i ) * all _ high _ propagating modes with indices @xmath94 that satisfy the condition ( [ sd - mm - cond ] ) , turn out to be independent of the others in spite of the interaction with rough surface .",
    "therefore , they form a coset of 1d non - interacting conducting channels with finite length of forward scattering @xmath226 and infinite backscattering length @xmath227 , @xmath244    * ( ii ) * as is well known from the standard theory of 1d localization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the transport through any 1d disordered system is determined only by the backscattering length @xmath227 and does not depend on the forward - scattering length @xmath226 . since the former diverges for every independent channel in line with the expression ( [ sd - mm - lnfb - cd ] ) , all of them exhibit the ballistic transport with the partial average transmittance @xmath151 .",
    "this means that according to the landauer s formula ( [ sd - mm - t ] ) , the transmittance of the coset of such independent ballistic modes is simply equal to their total number .    *",
    "( iii ) * as for _ low _ propagating modes with the indices @xmath94 contradicting to the condition ( [ sd - mm - cond ] ) , they remain to be mixed by surface scattering because the roughness power spectrum ( [ sd - mm - rps ] ) is non - zero for them , @xmath245 . these _",
    "mixed modes _ have finite forward- and back - scattering lengths . therefore ,",
    "for large enough waveguide length @xmath17 , they do not contribute to the total transmittance @xmath28 and the latter is equal to the number of independent ballistic modes .",
    "note that the distance @xmath241 between neighboring quantum wave numbers @xmath93 and @xmath246 increases as the mode index @xmath94 increases .",
    "therefore , the inequality ( [ sd - mm - cond ] ) restricts the mode index @xmath94 from below . that is why , in contrast with the conventional situation associated with the hierarchy of mode scattering lengths ( [ sd - mm - ln - hierarchy ] ) , the low modes are mixed and non - transparent , while high propagating modes are independent and ballistic . because of the sharp behavior of the roughness power spectrum ( [ sd - mm - rps ] ) , the transition from mixed to independent modes is also sharp .",
    "more analytical results can be obtained for waveguides with large number of conducting channels ( [ nd - large ] ) , if the quantum numbers @xmath94 of independent ballistic modes are also large , @xmath247 . in this case the inequality ( [ sd - mm - cond ] ) is reduced to the requirement @xmath248 which can be rewritten in the following explicit form @xmath249.\\ ] ] we remind that square brackets stand for the integer part of the inner expression .    the condition ( [ sd - mm - nmix ] ) determines the total number @xmath250 of mixed non - transparent modes , the total number @xmath251 of independent ballistic modes , and the critical value of the mode index @xmath94 that divides these two groups .",
    "all propagating modes with @xmath252 are independent and fully transparent , otherwise , they are mixed for @xmath253 and characterized by finite scattering lengths @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , the total average transmittance ( [ sd - mm - t ] ) of the multi - mode structure is @xmath254-\\left[(kd/\\pi)/\\alpha_c\\right],\\qquad \\alpha_c=\\sqrt{1+(k_cd/\\pi)^{-2}}\\,.\\ ] ]    the numbers @xmath250 and @xmath152 of mixed non - transparent and independent ballistic modes are governed by two parameters , the mode parameter @xmath98 and the dimensionless correlation parameter @xmath255 . in the case of  weak \" correlations",

    "if the parameter @xmath255 tends to infinity , @xmath258 , the rough surface profile becomes white - noise - like and , naturally , @xmath259 .",
    "the most appropriate case is when a random surface profile is strongly correlated so that the correlation parameter is small , @xmath260 .",
    "then the number of mixed non - transparent modes @xmath250 is much less than the total number of propagating modes @xmath96 , @xmath261\\ll n_d \\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad k_cd/\\pi\\ll1.\\ ] ] therefore , the number of independent modes @xmath152 is large .",
    "when the correlation parameter @xmath255 decreases and becomes anomalously small , @xmath262 , the number of mixed modes @xmath250 vanishes and _ all modes _ become independent and perfectly transparent . evidently , if the correlation parameter @xmath255 vanishes , @xmath263 , the roughness power spectrum ( [ sd - mm - rps ] ) , becomes delta - function - like and , as a consequence , @xmath264 . in this case the correlated disorder results in a perfect transmission of electrons or waves .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss the expression ( [ sd - mm - tcd ] ) for the total average transmittance . in figure 3",
    "an unusual step - wise dependence of @xmath28 on the mode parameter @xmath98 is shown , that is governed by the width @xmath142 of the rectangular power spectrum ( [ sd - mm - rps ] ) .    ) of surface - disordered guiding system versus the mode parameter @xmath98 . in the figure , the value of the normalized correlation parameter @xmath265 .",
    ", width=403,height=230 ]    let us discuss this figure . within the region @xmath266 , the inter - mode transitions caused by the specific surface correlations ,",
    "are forbidden for all conducting channels .",
    "therefore , all propagating modes are independent and ballistic , and the second term ( the number of mixed modes ) in the expression ( [ sd - mm - tcd ] ) for the total transmittance is equal to zero . here",
    "the transmittance exhibits a ballistic step - wise increase with an increase of the parameter @xmath98 .",
    "each step up arises for an integer value of the mode parameter @xmath98 , when a new conducting channel emerges in the guiding structure .    otherwise , when @xmath267 , in addition to the standard steps up originated from the first term in equation ( [ sd - mm - tcd ] ) , there are also the steps down connected with the second term .",
    "these steps down are provided by the correlated surface scattering and arise when a successive low mode becomes mixed and non - transparent .",
    "in other words , the positions of the @xmath94-th steps down are at the mobility edge point @xmath268 where the @xmath94-th conducting channels closes .",
    "since the values of the ratio @xmath269 are determined by the correlation parameter @xmath142 , the positions of steps down , in general , do not coincide with those of steps up .",
    "the situation may also occur when the steps up and down cancel each other within some interval of the mode parameter @xmath98 .",
    "the experimental observation of the discuseed non - coventional dependence seems to be highly interesting .",
