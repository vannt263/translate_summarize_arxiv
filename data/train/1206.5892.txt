    "the understanding of various properties of atomic nuclei starting from the realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions is one of fundamental problems in the theoretical nuclear physics .",
    "the recent studies in this field are characterized by several new developments .",
    "resulting from developments through 1960 s and 1990 s , there are now various parameterizations of the nucleon - nucleon interaction which reproduce experimental two - body scattering and deuteron data with high precision .",
    "systematic introduction of a three - nucleon force is in progress especially in the framework of the new development of the potential description in the chiral effective field theory @xcite .",
    "progress is also seen in an effective interaction theory in a restricted space , driven by active studies of low - momentum interactions @xcite .",
    "in addition , various ab - initio frameworks of many - body calculations have been explicitly applied to atomic nuclei , such as a monte - carlo method @xcite , a no - core shell model @xcite and a coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite . among them",
    ", the ccm is a promising method toward heavier nuclei because of the advantage of the size - extensivity .",
    "the ccm was devised for many - body problems in nuclear physics in 1950 s @xcite and the achievements in 1970 s by the bochum group were reported in ref .",
    "it was , however , almost discarded in nuclear physics community .",
    "the ccm found its place in quantum chemistry @xcite as a tool of the first - principle calculation .",
    "the method was reintroduced around 2000 in the description of atomic nuclei @xcite . because there are specific difficulties in a description and a treatment of the short - range part of a nucleon - nucleon interaction , applications of the ccm to nuclei require deeper understanding of an effective interaction theory .",
    "it is not surprising that a renewed interest arises in the ccm in parallel with the development of low - momentum interaction theory @xcite .",
    "there is already a considerable number of ccm calculations of light nuclei in recent years @xcite .",
    "these include the extension to excited states @xcite , nuclei far from the stability line @xcite and heavier nuclei such as @xmath1ca @xcite .",
    "contributions of a three - nucleon force has also been estimated in this method @xcite . nevertheless , because of the usefulness of the ccm framework to solve the quantum many - body problem as exactly as possible , it is important to clarify the structure of this framework as much as possible and to try to obtain the physical understanding of various correlations in a transparent way .",
    "such an attempt was proposed by suzuki @xcite in the early 1990 s as an application of the similarity - transformation theory for a quantum - mechanical eigenvalue problem .",
    "his reformulation introduces average many - body potentials as the generalization of the one - body mean field .",
    "the concept of the mean field is essentially important in almost all many - body systems , as the independent single - particle model is empirically established in those systems .",
    "as is shown below , the many - body average field is useful to group various terms which appear in the ccm practical calculations , and thus is helpful to elucidate the structure of the ccm many - body correlations .",
    "the transformation of the hamiltonian to the normal ordered form with respect to the reference state is inherent in this formulation .",
    "unfortunately , explicit applications of this method to nuclei has not been carried out so far .",
    "it is useful at the present stage to promote this formulation for the description of actual nuclei with using the realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction , in view of the future wide use of the ccm framework in nuclear many - body problems .",
    "we recapitulate the ccm formulation with introducing average many - body potentials in sec .",
    "ii , starting with the basic idea of the ccm .",
    "although we do not consider the contribution of a three - nucleon force in the present numerical calculations , the expression including three - body terms are presented in the initial part of sec .",
    "ii . as the first attempt of the actual application of this method to nuclei",
    ", we employ the approximation in which only one - body and two - body amplitudes are retained .",
    "this truncation is referred to as ccsd in the literature .",
    "numerical calculations are carried out for @xmath0he with using two modern nucleon - nucleon potentials , the cd - bonn potential @xcite and the argonne av18 potential @xcite .",
    "results of the energy and radius of @xmath0he in a harmonic oscillator model space are presented in sec .",
    "first , results with the bare potentials are shown , and then the calculations with low - momentum equivalent interactions are discussed .",
    "the magnitude of the contributions from the average many - body potential is estimated .",
    "the independence of the results on the harmonic oscillator constant of the reference state is demonstrated .",
    "if we do not include one - body amplitudes , the results varies with changing the oscillator constant .",
    "conclusions follow in sec .",
    "we first give the idea of the ccm in its naive form , and next present the introduction of many - body average potentials .",
    "the basic ansats of the coupled - cluster method @xcite is that the exact state @xmath2 of the hamiltonian @xmath3 of @xmath4 particles with the mass @xmath5 is given by the transformation operator @xmath6 acting on the reference state @xmath7 : @xmath8 the hamiltonian @xmath3 consists of the one - body kinetic energy @xmath9 , the two - nucleon interaction @xmath10 , the three - nucleon interaction @xmath11 , and so on . to be explicit , we write the hamiltonian as follows .",

    "the prescription of the ccm is to rewrite the schrdinger equation ( [ sheq ] ) as @xmath23 it is noted that in the standard ccm theory , the hamiltonian is supposed to be normal - ordered with respect to the reference state at this stage . hence we denote the hamiltonian by @xmath24 . the operator @xmath16 is determined by the decoupling equation for the similarity - transformed hamiltonian @xmath25 : @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",

    "the transparent procedure of the transformation in view of the effective interaction theory was formulated by suzuki @xcite . this method with introducing many - body average potentials is outlined in the next subsection .",
    "when the original hamiltonian @xmath3 do not have more than three - nucleon interactions , the expansion of @xmath32 terminates with the four - folded commutator and produces various terms up to six - body operators . if a three - nucleon interaction is present , more than five - folded commutators appear .",
    "suzuki and collaborators @xcite reformulated the ccm by introducing many - body average fields , which enables us to write down the decoupling equations in a compact form and thus to clarify the structure of various many - body correlations .",

    "the inclusion of @xmath125 , however , affects the energy only through the change of @xmath114 and @xmath55 , when only two - body interactions are present .",
    "therefore , the net effect of those higher correlations may be small .",
    "the estimation of the contribution of a three - nucleon interaction is important to quantitatively describe the saturation properties of nuclei .",
    "the expression for the contribution of the three - nucleon force to the ground - state energy is presented in appendix d , which helps to understand the different character of the contributions of the three - nucleon force and three - body correlations ( or an induced three - nucleon force ) . as for the treatment of short - range singularity of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "it is desirable to renormalize the high - momentum component of the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction in a more seamless way , working always in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "finally , numerical calculations should be extended to larger nuclei and also the consideration of excited states .",

    "the authors are grateful to k. suzuki and h. kamada for useful comments .",
    "remembering that the product of more than two transformation amplitudes in which the same suffix appears , e.g. @xmath126 , vanishes , the similarity - transformation of the one - body operator @xmath127 leads to up to 4-body operators .",
    "the expansion of the similarity - transformation @xmath128 with @xmath129 provides the following terms : @xmath130 where the widehat @xmath131 in the suffix means that @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are to be arranged in an ascending order .",
    "the expansion of the similarity - transformation @xmath135 provides up to 6-body operators .",
    "explicit expressions are the following , omitting terms including @xmath136 and higher excitation operators .",
    "note that the two - body part corresponds to @xmath137 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stf ] ) , the three - body part to @xmath138 originating from the two - body interaction @xmath10 , and so on .",
    "a three - body interaction @xmath11 give the following three - body terms in the similarity - transformation . more",
    "than 4-body operators are not shown for the sake of simplicity .",
    "when the hamiltonian contains a three - nucleon interaction , @xmath141 , the energy obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccme ] ) becomes @xmath142 it is useful to introduce the two - body interaction @xmath143 by holding the one coordinate of @xmath144 with occupied states , @xmath145 using this notation , the energy @xmath146 is written in a concise form as @xmath147 the factors @xmath148 and @xmath149 in front of @xmath143 in the second and third terms come from the statistical weight and are naturally derived .",
    "the necessity of these factors are recently pointed out by hebeler and schwenk in ref .",
    "it is noted , however , we also have to consistently include @xmath11 and @xmath52 in decoupling equations .",
    "the expressions become complicated , which are beyond the scope of this article .",
