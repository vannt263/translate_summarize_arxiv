    "<S> we report on several new basic properties of a parabolic dot in the presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between the potential strength and the landau level ( ll ) energy spacing serves as the coupling constant of this problem . in the weak coupling limit the energy spectrum in each hilbert subspace of an angular momentum consists of discrete lls of graphene . in the intermediate coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> non - resonant states form a closely spaced energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find , counter - intuitively , that resonant quasi - boundstates of both positive and negative energies exist in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of resonant quasi - boundstates of negative energies is a unique property of massless dirac fermions . as the strong coupling limit </S>",
    "<S> is approached resonant and non - resonant states transform into anomalous states , whose probability densities develop a narrow peak inside the well and another broad peak under the potential barrier . these properties may investigated experimentally by measuring optical transition energies that can be described by a scaling function of the coupling constant . </S>"
