    "deep inelastic scattering provides worthy information about the structure of nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the papers of gluck , reya and vogt @xcite have shown that quite good agreement with the data ( and moreover some predictions ) may be obtained assuming valence  like parton distributions at some small scale @xmath0 and evolving them using perturbative qcd .",
    "nowadays it is not possible to calculate the initial distributions using directly qcd and we are left with various , less or more phenomenological , models .",
    "the idea of calculating leading twist parton distributions using quark models has over twenty years @xcite and there were many implementations of it using the bag model , soliton models , the colour  dielectric model and others @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that interactions between quarks may be approximately described by a mean field confining them .",
    "i fact , even one of the most prominent quark models , the bag model @xcite ( in the static cavity approximation ) may be treated in such a way .    in the mean field approach",
    "quarks move independently and there arises the so called centre of mass problem , resulting from the simple observation , that independently moving particles can not stand for a composite state of definite total momentum .",
    "the problem manifests itself in the fact , that quark distributions , calculated in such a model , spread over all bjrken @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 instead of having support in the region from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "there are many methods of curing this problem , but all of them have some drawbacks .",
    "for example the method using peierls  yoccoz or peierls  thoules projection gives badly normalised quark distributions . in this paper",
    "we follow the idea of szymacha @xcite that the independent particle model of a composite particle corresponds to the particle moving in an auxiliary external potential .",
    "tensor @xmath6 describing inclusive photon - nucleon scattering may be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the photon energy and momentum , @xmath10 are normalised to @xmath5 final states with energy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the initial ( normalised to @xmath5 ) nucleon state with energy @xmath13 .    for @xmath12 being an eigenstate of definite momentum @xmath14 and spin @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and ( formally ) @xmath18 , + we obtain usual form for @xmath6 @xmath19 if we approximate the real nucleon by independent particles ( as in the bag model ) , then @xmath12 can not be a state of definite momentum and ( [ wmunu ] ) is much more useful then ( [ wmunup ] ) .",

    "as was already stated , independent particles can not correspond to a state which is a momentum eigenstate . following szymacha _ et .",
    "@xcite we will assume that they describe the nucleon with ( yet unknown ) wavefunction @xmath36 , bounded by an auxiliary external potential .",
    "nevertheless our first step is to calculate structure functions of the bag model ( in the static cavity approximation ) without any improvements for the centre of mass motion .",
    "we assume that in dis photon interacts only with a given quark from a nucleon , without any influence on other quarks , exiting it into the final state @xmath37 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ wmunu ] ) may be rewritten as ( we add the subscript @xmath38 to indicate that this @xmath6 is calculated directly from the quark wave function ) @xmath39 where it was assumed that for higher excitation , final states @xmath37 may be approximated by plane waves @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the initial wave function of the quark @xmath38 .    since bispinor @xmath42",
    "is uniquely described by corresponding momentum @xmath43 and mass @xmath44 , we may replace @xmath45 by @xmath46 @xmath47 . for large @xmath48",
    "we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the initial quark energy ) , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 we have to take into account that mass of the exited quark @xmath54 is the same as the mass of quark in the ground state , hence there is only one term , with @xmath55 , in the sum @xmath56 .",
    "the structure functions calculated in the previous section should be considered as structure functions for the nucleon in an artificial external potential .",
    "photon interacting with such nucleon may excite it into higher eigenstate in the artificial potential , or excite its internal degrees of freedom , or do the both .",
    "since the nucleon is a composite object , its coupling to the photon can not be described by simple matrix @xmath57 .",
    "we assume this coupling to be of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is momentum of the final state .",
    "+ in general this coupling may have more complicated spinor structure , but for large @xmath48 other choices are effectively equivalent with ours provided we allow @xmath60 to be dependent on the photon polarisation , i.e.  we take @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 . for large @xmath48 , due to the energy conservation , we obtain @xmath64 , so in fact our formfactor depends only on the polarisation , @xmath48 and @xmath65 . for a given process ( fixed @xmath35 ) @xmath48 remains unchanged and we may write @xmath6 for @xmath66 @xmath63 in analogous to ( [ wq ] ) form ( hereafter @xmath67 ) @xmath68 with @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 given by eqs .",

    "since for massless quarks @xmath87 ( the callan  gross relation ) , we are interested only in @xmath88 , which is directly related to the quark distribution function . to obtain @xmath88 we have to perform three steps : + a ) calculate the naive structure function @xmath89 , using given quark wavefunction ; + b ) calculate @xmath90 , using the centre of mass wavefunction @xmath36 ( function of the nucleon in the auxiliary potential ) ; + c ) solve the equation eq .",

    "to obtain @xmath93 from eq .",
    "( [ wacm ] ) , we have to calculate @xmath94 . since @xmath95 , we may write @xmath96 the term @xmath97 should correspond to overlapping function between translated states of the nucleon treated as a composite object . in our model",
    "the nucleon consist of three quarks with wavefunctions @xmath98 , so @xmath99 to obtain analogous expression for @xmath100 let us remind that for a dirac particle , mean value of the matrix @xmath101 may be interpreted as a mean velocity .",
    "it is thus natural to take @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the energy of the quark @xmath104 , and @xmath72 is the total energy of the system .",
    "+ for identical quark wavefunctions we obtain @xmath105 equations ( [ psicmtrans ] ) and ( [ psicmalpha ] ) mean that we can calculate @xmath93 just using @xmath41 , without introducing @xmath36 .    functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 calculated using the bag model wavefunctions are shown in fig .",
    "[ ryswqwcm ] .",
    "taking fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ splot ] ) we obtain @xmath108 where @xmath109 for wavefunctions normalised to @xmath5 we obtain @xmath110 , and hence from ( [ splott ] ) @xmath111 since @xmath112 has an interpretation as the quark distribution function , the above equation stands for obvious normalisation condition ( or from the experimental point of view bj \" orken @xcite or adler @xcite sum rule ) .",
    "it should be stressed that other methods of obtaining the structure functions from the bag model have some problems with fulfilling this conditon @xcite .",
    "differentiating ( [ splott ] ) @xmath113 times and putting @xmath114 we obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 the above expression may be rewritten in the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 ( mellin moments ) .",
    "it is well known that in the bag model without any improvements for the centre of mass motion one gets @xmath119 .",
    "this remains true in any independent particle model with the `` volume '' energy with energy - momentum tensor of the form : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is chosen so to guarantee conservation of the total ( quarks + `` volume '' ) energy - momentum tensor @xmath122 on the other hand energy - momentum tensor @xmath123 of our nucleon moving in the auxiliary potential can not be conserved , and so corresponding @xmath124 .",
    "but if we modify the condition ( [ demutmu ] ) by taking into account cm motion @xmath125 then we obtain @xmath126 although in such case @xmath127 .    on the other hand , equation ( [ demutmucm ] )",
    "together with ( [ psicmalpha ] ) allows us to find improved energy @xmath72 of our bound nucleon .",
    "for @xmath128 identical quarks it satisfies the following condition @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the nucleon energy calculated using ( [ demutmu ] ) .",
    "+ for the bag model with massless quarks we obtain @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the bag radius .",
    "to calculate effective quark distributions , we may use equation ( [ splot ] ) or ( [ splott ] ) , but since @xmath90 and @xmath91 are slowly decreasing functions ( see fig .",
    "[ ryswqwcm ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ splott ] ) is much more useful for numerical calculations .",
    "this equation is in fact fredholm equation of the first kind , generally ill - posed  its solutions may not exist or may be not unique .",
    "the standard method of solving such problems is to convert them into variational ones with additional regularization term @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we introduce a smoothing functional @xmath133= \\int",
    "\\left|t^{\\perp\\perp}_q(a)- \\int t^{\\perp\\perp}_{cm}(ax ) w^{\\perp\\perp}_{eff}(x)\\ , dx\\right|^2 da + \\lambda \\int \\left|w^{\\perp\\perp}_{eff}(x)\\right|^2dx,\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is a regularization parameter .",
    "now our goal is to find minimum of the functional @xmath135 . since for physical solution @xmath136",
    ", we impose this condition as a constraint for our variational problem .",
    "we have solved our problem using procedure ptipr from @xcite .",
    "results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ rysweffa ] .    in fig .",
    "[ rysweffau ] we have plotted l.h.s . of the equation ( [ splott ] ) , which can be written in the shorthand form as @xmath137 and its r.h.s .",
    "corresponding to solutions for @xmath138 and @xmath139 plotted in fig .",
    "[ rysweffa ] .",
    "the obtained quark distributions in the proton can not be compared directly with data . according to the usual procedure",
    "we assume them to be twist two contribution to the structure functions at small scale @xmath140 , and then we evolve them to a higher scale .",
    "results of the leading order ( lo ) evolution for @xmath21 to @xmath141 are plotted in the fig .",
    "[ ewolucja ] .",
    "there also is shown for comparison parametrisation of grv @xcite .",
    "the chosen initial scales are @xmath142 ( the initial scale of grv in the lo ) , and @xmath143 , which we found as giving better predictions in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "it may be easily seen that evolution of our quark distributions from @xmath144 gives too steep @xmath21 in the small @xmath1 region , but it is possible to find @xmath145 giving much better agreement with the data .",
    "on the other hand , our @xmath21 differs drastically from the data for @xmath146 .",
    "we attempted to cure this problem taking into account target mass effects .",
    "let us start with the remark , that since grv parametrisation was obtained by evolving ( according to qcd ) initial distributions given at small @xmath0 , we do nt have to perform the evolution ourselves  it is enough to compare our predictions with that of grv at some small scale larger then @xmath148 .",
    "described in the previous section procedure of finding quark distributions assumes that their entire dependence ( with fixed bjrken @xmath1 ) on @xmath48 comes from qcd . but",
    "due to simple kinetic target mass effects it can not be true for smaller @xmath48 . it was found many years ago @xcite , that much better scaling may be obtained in terms of the variable @xmath147 related to the bj \" orken @xmath1 by @xmath149 where @xmath150 stands for target ( proton ) mass .",
    "the connection between usual @xmath151 and the scaling function @xmath152 , which for large @xmath48 coincides with @xmath153 , ( in that limit @xmath154 ) is given by @xcite : @xmath155 where @xmath147 is the function of @xmath1 , see eq.([xi ] ) .",
    "@xmath156 obtained from the above expression with @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the effective bag structure function obtained in the section 7 , compared with grv parametrisation for the same @xmath48 , is shown in the fig .  [ fxi1 ] .",
    "we have proposed here a method of finding hadron structures functions in independent particle models .",
    "the method leads to the structure functions with the correct support and exactly fulfils the normalisation condition for valence quark distributions .",
    "the structure functions found for the bag model in the static cavity approximation differs drastically from the `` naive '' ones , calculated without any improvement for the centre of mass motion .",
    "they disagree with the data , but it is possible to obtain rough agreement in the small @xmath1 region , evolving them using perturbative qcd .      it should be stressed that our disagreement with the large @xmath48 data arises mainly from quite different behaviour of our valence quark distributions at low @xmath48 , which are finite for @xmath159 , and the ones used by grv , which are singular in that limit ( although their @xmath160 ) .",
    "in fact , any independent particle model gives finite @xmath161 . to obtain singular",
    "@xmath162 one has probably to take into account regge trajectories for final states in the deeply inelastic scattering ."
