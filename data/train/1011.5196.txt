    "<S> it is shown that born - infeld gravity a high energy deformation of einstein gravity removes the singularities of a cosmic string . </S>",
    "<S> the respective vacuum solution results to be free of conical singularity and closed timelike curves . </S>",
    "<S> the space ends at a minimal circle where the curvature invariants vanish ; but this circle can not be reached in a finite proper time .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall investigate high energy deformations of general relativity ( gr ) based on the following three guiding principles :    a ) : :    the theory must reduce to general relativity in the low field limit . </S>",
    "<S> b ) : :    the spacetime dynamics must be described by second order equations . </S>",
    "<S> c ) : :    it must provide a proper treatment in order to avoid singularities .    </S>",
    "<S> many deformations can accomplish the condition ( a ) , but just a few of them satisfy ( b ) . \" theories @xcite , lead to fourth order equations . </S>",
    "<S> they can be reformulated as scalar - tensor theories to give second order equations ; however this procedure results in violations of the equivalence principle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , vacuum singular gr solutions remain as solutions of smooth @xmath0 theories , so threatening the requirement ( c ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> lovelock s extension of gr does it @xcite , but it only departs from gr for dimensions bigger than four . in turn , a few candidates were proposed following the guidelines ( a ) and ( c ) ( see e.g. the non - exhaustive list @xcite-@xcite ) . remarkably , there is no conceptual framework accommodating the three requirements . to face the item ( c ) we will consider one of the prototypes of a gr singular structure : the circular symmetric vacuum solution in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite , or its ( 3 + 1)-dimensional analogue , the cosmic string @xcite @xmath1 in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions ( @xmath2 is absent ) </S>",
    "<S> , this metric solves the einstein equations for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( cartesian coordinates @xmath5 are defined as usual , and we use hereafter @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the solution looks as a particle of mass @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 at the origin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no gravitational field surrounds the particle since the metric is manifestly flat , as is typical of vacuum solutions to einstein equations without cosmological constant in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> actually the particle shows itself by means of topological properties : i ) the space displays a conical singularity , because the mass @xmath7 amounts a deficit angle @xmath9 ; ii ) the minkowskian time @xmath10 suffers a jump @xmath11 when the circle is completed . </S>",
    "<S> added to this singular structure , the _ cosmon _ as named in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also exhibits violation of causality because closed timelike curves ( ctc ) occur . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the interval ( [ cosmon ] ) on the closed curves of constant @xmath12 is @xmath13 which means that curves with radio @xmath14 are ctc . </S>",
    "<S> this unpleasant feature was avoided in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by resorting to proper boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will show that the entire singular structure of cosmons is prevented by a high energy deformation of gr developed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite-@xcite .    as the starting point for describing the gravitational field </S>",
    "<S> , we will propose a _ </S>",
    "<S> determinantal _ born - infeld ( bi ) lagrangian density @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the absolute value of the determinant . </S>",
    "<S> the structure ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) resembles the one used by born and infeld in their non linear electrodynamics @xcite . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the field tensor @xmath17 will depend on the dynamical variable describing the gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath18 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) has the units of @xmath19 and controls the low energy limit alluded in the requirement ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since @xmath20 then the lagrangian ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) goes to @xmath21 when @xmath17 takes values much smaller than @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> so , born - infeld gravity will reduce to gr if @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the requirement ( b ) implies that the quantities involved in the lagrangian ( [ acciondetelectro ] ) should depend just on the dynamical variables and their first derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> this condition could seem to be out of tune with gr , since the curvature scalar depends on the second derivatives of its dynamical field ( the metric ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , there is a beautiful way of circumventing this blind alley , by moving out towards an equivalent formulation of gr which depends just on first derivatives of its dynamical variables . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , einstein theory can be rephrased in a spacetime possessing absolute parallelism @xcite where the _ vielbein _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 a set of 1-forms plays the role of the gravitational potentials , while the metric @xmath24 is a subsidiary field . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute parallelism is ruled by the weitzenbck connection @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the vector basis dual to the _ </S>",
    "<S> vielbein_. this connection is metric compatible and curvatureless : weitzenbck spacetime is flat , but it possesses torsion @xmath27 i.e . , @xmath28 , which is the agent where the gravitational degrees of freedom are encoded . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between both pictures reveals itself when one discovers that the levi - civita curvature scalar @xmath29 can be rewritten as @xmath30\\ = \\ 2\\,w_1\\,-\\,w_2\\,-\\,4\\,w_3\\ , + \\,8\\ , \\mathrm{e}^{-1}\\,(\\mathrm{e}\\,t^{\\mu\\ , \\ , \\rho}_{\\ \\ , \\mu})_{,\\,\\rho}\\ , \\label{equiv}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath32 , and the invariants @xmath33 are @xmath34 remarkably , the advantage of the teleparallel picture of gravity is that the total divergence term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equiv ] ) can be ruled out to work just with a first order lagrangian @xmath35 , which will preserve the dynamical content of einstein theory anyway . </S>",
    "<S> this distinctive feature makes weitzenbck spacetime a privileged geometric structure to formulate modified theories of gravitation , since it guarantees that any modified lagrangian in this language will assure second order field equations . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is essential to satisfy the requirement ( b ) , otherwise fourth order differential equations would be obtained . summarizing </S>",
    "<S> , we are building a theory of gravity where the fundamental piece is the set of 2-forms @xmath28 ( notice the similarity with yang - mills theories ) , so guaranteeing the requirement ( b ) . to accomplish the requirement ( a ) we should demand that @xmath36 where @xmath37 the more general tensor @xmath38 fulfilling the condition ( [ condition ] ) reads @xmath39 , @xmath40 . for simplicity we will set @xmath41 ; thus , in four dimensions the theory reduces to @xmath42=-\\lambda/(16\\,\\pi)\\ ! </S>",
    "<S> \\left(\\sqrt{|g_{\\mu \\nu } -2\\lambda ^{-1}s_{\\mu \\lambda \\rho } \\ </S>",
    "<S> , t_{\\nu } ^{\\,\\,\\,\\lambda \\rho } |}- \\sqrt{|g_{\\mu \\nu } |}\\right ) . \\label{acciondet}\\ ] ]    let us now analyze the requirement ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that bi gravity ( [ acciondet ] ) prevents the singular structure of the gr cosmon metric ( [ cosmon ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we remark that the cosmon was endowed with spin @xmath8 by considering the coordinate @xmath43 as the continuous time in the place of the minkowskian time @xmath44 ; in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , this procedure led to a non - zero @xmath45 at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the mass @xmath7 came from a similar procedure . in bi gravity , instead , the equations determine not the metric but the vielbein ; they contain more integration constants than gr does . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath8 and @xmath46 will appear as labels for the family of cylindrically symmetric vielbeins solving the dynamical equations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the solution of the motion equations is given by the vielbein @xcite @xmath47 where the function @xmath48 solves the cubic equation @xmath49 the vielbein ( [ vielbein ] ) implies the metric @xmath50 then the function @xmath48 constitutes the sole difference between gr and bi gravity . </S>",
    "<S> gr is recovered when @xmath51 , as expected from the low energy limit ( [ accionbaja ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , eq .  ( [ rela ] ) </S>",
    "<S> says that @xmath52 and the metric ( [ cosmonbi ] ) acquires the flat form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cosmon ] ) . for finite values of @xmath18 and </S>",
    "<S> far away from the string , the low field regime is also restituted . nevertheless , the bi cosmic string is a geometry with a @xmath8-depending non - constant scalar curvature @xmath53 depicted in figure [ fig1 ] for several values of @xmath18 .        according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rela ] ) , @xmath54 goes to infinity as @xmath55 approaches the value @xmath56 . at this minimal circle , @xmath29 and other curvature invariants such as @xmath57 and @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> become zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spacetime is flat not only far from the string ( gr region ) but at @xmath59 as well . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to verify that the proper time to reach @xmath59 diverges @xcite , which means that bi gravity avoids the conical singularity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ctc s are prevented too . even though the interval on the closed curves of constant @xmath12 does not differ from the one of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ctc ] ) since @xmath55 is constant , then @xmath48 does not play any role , however ctc s are forbidden because the lower bound of the radial coordinate @xmath55 implies that the interval ( [ ctc ] ) is negative definite . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> the same mechanism responsible for the taming of the conical singularity in bi gravity also provides a natural chronological protection .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the coordinate change @xmath60 in the vielbein ( [ vielbein ] ) allows to regard the curved geometry ( [ cosmonbi ] ) as a space of a variable deficit angle ranging from @xmath9 at spatial infinity , to @xmath61 at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature might have important observational implications on the lensing effect . as another remarkable physical consequence </S>",
    "<S> , bi gravity seems to forbid the possibility of packing energy in arbitrarily small regions . </S>",
    "<S> differing from gr , any junction of this vacuum solution with an inner solution has to be made at a radius bigger than @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this property is another manifestation of the born - infeld regularization program . as a final remark </S>",
    "<S> , we emphasize that the bi determinantal gravity ( [ acciondet ] ) departs from a mere  @xmath64 \" theory even at the lowest order in @xmath65 ( @xmath66 stands for the invariant @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is essential for smoothing the cosmic string singularities , since the solution has @xmath68 @xcite . </S>"
