    "the origin of prompt emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been an open issue for more than 40 years .",
    "it is mainly observed in the @xmath5 range , most spectra being fitted by a smoothed broken power - law ( the so - called band function ) with break energy @xmath6 .",
    "the typical low - energy photon index is @xmath2 ( where @xmath7 below @xmath8 ) , while the typical high - energy photon index is @xmath3 ( where @xmath9 above @xmath8 ) .",
    "observed light curves are highly variable .",
    "the variability can sometimes be @xmath4  ms , but pulses with various widths are observed . for typical long grbs ,",
    "light curves consist of many variable pulses , so that the duration , @xmath10  s , is usually longer .",
    "so far , many models have been proposed to explain this most luminous phenomenon in our universe  ( see recent reviews , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the classical scenario of the prompt emission is the optically - thin synchrotron internal shock model  ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , where shocks are responsible for dissipation of the outflow kinetic energy and observed gamma rays are attributed to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons .",
    "however , there are a couple of issues in the classical scenario .",
    "first , the low - energy photon index may be incompatible with values predicted by synchrotron emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is the case especially when relativistic electrons are in the fast - cooling regime , which leads to @xmath11 , although the klein - nishina effect on synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process may reproduce @xmath2  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the possible resolutions of this fast - cooling problem is to consider the magnetic field decay timescale that is comparable to the electron cooling timescale  @xcite .",
    "injection of electrons to acceleration processes is one of the related issues .",
    "shock acceleration of primary electrons may be inefficient for sufficiently small emission radii because of the rapid cooling in the strong magnetic field region at the vicinity of the shock  @xcite .",
    "if the outflow is magnetized enough , even for sub - luminal shocks , recent _ ab intio _ particle - in - cell simulations of collisionless shocks indicate that acceleration of nonthermal electrons at relativistic shocks are inefficient whereas ions can be accelerated  @xcite .",
    "another issue is the radiative efficiency problem  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this depends on estimates of the afterglow kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "the high efficiency can be achieved by a large dispersion in the lorentz factor of the outflows  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it does not seem so easy to reconcile that with the observed spectral correlations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . a recent discussion of the classical scenario is found in daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    on the other hand , many alternative models have been suggested .",
    "diffusive synchrotron radiation can explain the low - energy photon index if the fast - cooling problem is fixed  @xcite . instead of dissipation of the kinetic energy via internal shocks , dissipation of the magnetic energy via , e.g. , magnetic reconnection may play a crucial role as the dissipation mechanism , and observed gamma rays may be synchrotron or other electromagnetic radiation from relativistic electrons  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if significant thermal energy is stored in the grb jet by energy deposition from the central engine and/or via some dissipation below the photosphere , the prompt emission may originate from quasi - thermal emission caused by comptonization or coulomb heating  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one of the appealing possibilities is to consider the slow heating scenario . around the photosphere ,",
    "electrons that are slowly heated can lead to @xmath2 via comptonization  @xcite , where the typical electron energy is determined by the balance between heating and cooling  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the neutron - rich outflow , coulomb collisions should work as slow heating below the baryonic photosphere , leading to hard photon spectra of @xmath12 and @xmath13 via the pair injection by the @xmath14 reaction and subsequent cascades  @xcite .",
    "such slow heating may be caused by stochastic acceleration ( so - called second - order fermi acceleration ) over the sub - hydrodynamical timescale and/or hydrodynamical timescale , which may occur in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) and plasma turbulences generated by shock or magnetic dissipation such as magnetic reconnections  @xcite .",
    "emission at higher energies above @xmath15  mev should also be important to reveal the radiation mechanism of the prompt emission , and various high - energy processes such as comptonized thermal , ssc  @xcite , proton - induced cascade  @xcite , and proton synchrotron  @xcite emissions , were discussed .",
    "such high - energy emission had been sparsely detected by the egret onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , however , significant observational progress has been achieved by _",
    "dozens of grbs have been observed by lat onboard _ fermi _ , and some bursts can be fitted by the band function up to gev energies  @xcite , while some of them ( grb 090510 , 090902b , 090926a ) clearly have an extra hard component at @xmath16  mev  @xcite .",
    "grbs with the extra gev component belong to the brightest class of grbs , which may indicate that this could be more common , even though it can be seen only in bright lat grbs  @xcite .",
    "another feature found by _",
    "fermi _ is that @xmath17  mev gamma rays are delayed by @xmath18  s in the cosmological rest frame , behind the onset of the mev emission .",
    "the origin of the high - energy emission is now under active debate .",
    "late - time high - energy gamma - ray emission from grbs such as 080916c , 090510 , and 090902b has been attributed to afterglow emission rather than the prompt emission  @xcite .",
    "but , the high - energy emission in the early phase usually has a strong variability and often correlates with the mev emission , which indicates an internal origin  @xcite .",
    "since the simple one - zone leptonic model often has difficulties , multi - zone models , not only the ssc model  @xcite but also the external inverse - compton ( ic ) model  @xcite and the synchrotron model  @xcite , have been invoked .",
    "the one - zone hadronic models are also viable , and the high - energy emission can be explained by proton - induced cascade or proton synchrotron emission  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic models are of interest , since grbs may be the sources of observed ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , whose origin has been a big mystery for about 50 years  @xcite , and their neutrino signals may be seen by ongoing neutrino observations  ( a recent review is * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study a slow heating scenario in the presence of electromagnetic cascades initiated by injection at high energies .",
    "to explain the mev emission self - consistenly , we consider effects of acceleration ( via the second - order fermi mechanism ) or heating of secondaries , which can be anticipated in the post - shock region of relativistic shocks ( or magnetic reconnection ) .",
    "we show that cascades can play an important role in the injection of re - accelerated / heated particles , and slow heating scenarios via stochastic acceleration or wave heating typically lead to hard spectra compatible with observations . as an injection process at high energies",
    ", we consider an application to hadronic injection via @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions , whereby the hadronic models have the appealing feature of explaining an extra hard component at gev energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes an overview of the model , and we provide the numerical method and its results in section  3 .",
    "we discuss implications for neutrinos in sections  4 , and our results are summarized in section  6 . throughout this work ,",
    "cosmological parameters are set to @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , and we adopt the conventional notation @xmath22 .",
    "in this work , we investigate the role of particle re - acceleration , motivated by the goal to resolve the low - energy photon index and fast - cooling problems . in the post - shock region of relativistic shocks , turbulent magnetic fields would be generated , where stochastic acceleration ( or second - fermi acceleration ) may work efficiently since the alfvn velocity is expected to be close to @xmath23 . the second - order fermi acceleration over the sub - hydrodynamical scale plays a role of slow heating to avoid the fast cooling problem of relativistic electrons , and it may give harder electron spectra than the typical first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "this possibility was proposed by bykov & mszros ( 1996 ) and recently studied by asano & terasawa ( 2010 ) .",
    "also , particles may be slowly heated by mhd waves , as has been discussed in the solar corona  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    such slow heating operates not only for primary electrons but also electron - positron pairs generated via cascades initiated by some high - energy injection .",
    "motivated by the electron injection / acceleration problem and the existence of an extra hard component at @xmath24  10 mev , this work focuses on a hadronic model , where pairs are produced via the electromagnetic cascade initiated by hadronic injection from @xmath25 and @xmath1 reactions , i.e. , the proton - induced cascade .",
    "although there is a similarity to the collisional scenario proposed by beloborodov ( 2010 ) , our scenarios are different in that leptons are heated by turbulence rather than coulomb heating and the dissipation radius can be much larger .",
    "the hadronic emission associated with prompt emission was originally motivated by the hypothesis that observed uhecrs come from grbs  @xcite .",
    "this requires that the uhecr energy ( at @xmath26  ev ) is comparable to the gamma - ray energy , @xmath27 .",
    "although the grb rate evolution , total gamma - ray energy and proton spectral index are still uncertain , the total nonthermal baryon loading is expected to be large , @xmath28  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if sufficiently large baryon loading is realized and the photomeson production efficiency is high enough , the hadronic emission can dominate over the leptonic emission at high energies  @xcite , and the visibility of the hadronic components at high energies is enhanced when the high - energy photon spectrum is much steeper than @xmath29 .",
    "the extra hard component in the gev range , which was seen by _ fermi _ , can be explained by the hadronic emission  @xcite .",
    "but , in the previous work , the band function was assumed _ ad hoc _ , otherwise the low - energy photon index becomes too soft ( which leads to overestimating gamma rays and neutrinos ) .    in the next subsection ,",
    "we consider shock dissipation in the baryonic outflow and shock acceleration of particles .",
    "then , we discuss stochastic acceleration ( or heating ) by plasma / mhd turbulence in the downstream region to take into account its effects with a simplified model .      in the classical scenario ,",
    "electrons are accelerated at internal shocks , and the observed gamma - ray emission is attributed to electromagnetic radiation from non - thermal electrons . if the outflow contains baryons , it is natural to expect that protons are also accelerated on a timescale @xmath30 where @xmath31 in the efficient case  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the acceleration timescale is typically fast , and protons that are accelerated up to sufficiently high energies should interact with non - thermal photons via photomeson production , leading to @xmath32 neutrinos  @xcite , gev - tev gamma rays  @xcite , and uhe gamma rays  @xcite . around the photosphere , gev - tev neutrinos and gev - tev gamma rays are also produced through the @xmath25 reaction  @xcite .    in our model , we consider a similar picture in which charged particles are accelerated at shocks .",
    "motivated by the electron injection / acceleration issue , however , we focus on the case of hadronic injection ( neglecting primary electrons ) , where proton - induced gamma - ray emission is especially relevant . when the shock dissipation radius is small enough",
    ", the efficient @xmath25 reaction occurs in the baryon - rich outflow , and high - energy gamma rays and pairs are produced as well as neutrinos .",
    "also , sufficiently high - energy protons can interact with soft photons which may come from residual thermal emission around the photosphere  @xcite ( and/or non - thermal emission from primary electrons if their acceleration occurs ) .",
    "those @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions lead to production of high - energy gamma rays with @xmath33 and pairs with @xmath34 .",
    "lower - energy photons should also be produced via the synchrotron and ic processes , which eventually affect the distribution of seed photons so that the processes are nonlinear .",
    "sufficiently high - energy gamma rays should lead to pair creation with seed photons at @xmath35 , so that the following cascade is unavoidable . as long as the pair - creation opacity of high - energy gamma rays is larger than unity , gamma rays lead to generation of pairs that lose their energies via synchrotron and ic emissions . as a result , the cascade gamma - ray spectrum will be eventually formed , where the number of pairs can be larger than that of pairs injected directly from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions .",
    "we are interested in cases where the @xmath0 or @xmath1 reaction efficiency is high enough , otherwise the hadronic component is insufficient to explain the high - energy gamma - ray emission observed by _",

    "then , we set the stochastic acceleration ( or heating ) rate such that the synchrotron peak of @xmath101 electrons correspond to @xmath6 .",
    "we also introduce sub - parameters , @xmath111 and @xmath138 , but our main results are not sensitive to those additional parameters . the former is related to how long stochastic acceleration ( or heating ) operates , and @xmath139 is needed for the re - acceleration / heating to work well . since the calculations for @xmath140 are too time - consuming , we take @xmath141 , which is enough for our purpose .",
    "the latter parameter is physically motivated by the finite lifetime of the turbulent magnetic field , and we assume @xmath142 in this work .",
    "thus , our `` one - zone '' code divides the shocked region into two parts : a strongly magnetized region of scale @xmath138 and the second , remaining part of scale @xmath143 .",
    "the photon density is assumed to be homogeneous over the entire scale @xmath39 , and secondary particles from protons would be injected also homogeneously in this scale .",
    "but , for simplicity , we treat only a fraction @xmath144 of the secondary particles injected in the strongly magnetized region .",
    "although ic emission by the particles injected in the non - disturbed region may appear in the gev range  @xcite , we neglect such emission .",
    "the absence of heating in this region may make such emission less important .",
    "the parameter @xmath138 can affect high - energy ic spectra quantitatively , but the qualitative features of our results are not altered ( see below ) . the calculation time is set to @xmath145 for the secondary particles , while that for accelerated protons is @xmath117 .",
    "we do not consider stochastic acceleration of protons since more efficient shock acceleration is assumed .",
    "we also remark that the energy ranges for pion - producing protons and electrons with @xmath146 are quite different .",
    "also , we neglect re - acceleration of pions and muons , though it might be potentially relevant ( see appendix a ) .    in figure  2 , we show the case where stochastic re - acceleration ( or heating ) is included , for the same parameter set shown in figure  1 .",
    "when the re - acceleration / heating is turned on , electrons and positrons can avoid their fast cooling , and the energy balance between acceleration / heating and cooling gives the typical energy of @xmath147 .",
    "synchrotron emission forms another component in addition to the flat proton - induced cascade component , and its peak can be attributed to the observed peak energy .",
    "the non - linear effect on the photomeson production enhances the proton - induced cascade component compared with the case in figure  1 . as argued in section  2.2",
    ", one sees that a hard electron distribution indeed leads to the low - energy photon index of @xmath2 .",
    "the high - energy synchrotron spectrum of re - accelerated / heated particles is expected to become steeper and steeper above the synchrotron peak .",
    "but , as a result of the superposition of the slow heating component and the underlying cascade component , the high - energy photon index is effectively regarded as @xmath13 at @xmath148  mev energies . as demonstrated in figure  2 , in the slow heating scenario with the electromagnetic cascade initiated by some injection at high energies ,",
    "the resulting spectrum consists of an apparent broken power - law component due to the synchrotron emission from re - accelerated / heated particles and an extra hard component from the cascade emission ( including ic emission by re - accelerated / heated particles ) , which is different from the previous work  @xcite that instead obtained a simple power law with a high - energy cutoff .",
    "such a spectrum may also be responsible for observed _ fermi _ grbs , e.g. , grb 090926b  @xcite .",
    "note that the gamma - ray luminosity in the mev range comes from re - accelerated / heated leptons whose energies are supplied by the plasma / mhd turbulence , so that it can be larger than a fraction of the proton luminosity that is transferred to electromagnetic components via decay of mesons and muons .",
    "the spectral break at @xmath15 kev is determined by the parameter @xmath111 , below which the stochastic acceleration ( or heating ) becomes ineffective .",
    "this parameter is kept as a free one in this simulation so that the quantitative value of this low - energy break does not carry strong implications .",
    "this break s appearance is interestingly similar to the observed one reported in some of _ fermi _ grbs .    .",
    "used sub - parameters ( that are not critical for the result ) are @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath135 .",
    "the obtained gamma - ray luminosity is @xmath151 and the corresponding thomson depth is @xmath136 . ]    in figure  3 , we show the fate of shock - accelerated high - energy protons that are injected with a simple power law .",
    "the photomeson production efficiency is so high in this parameter set that almost all the protons are eventually depleted .",
    "note that uhecr production without their depletion is possible at larger dissipation radii  @xcite but larger baryon loading would be required to achieve the same hadronic gamma - ray flux .",
    "one sees that high - energy mesons are mainly produced by the photomeson production , while lower - energy mesons come from the @xmath0 reaction , and the result is in agreement with the analytical expectation described in section  2.1 .",
    "hence , when protons are accelerated up to sufficiently high energies , one expects that the photomeson production is typically dominant in cascaded gamma rays , though the signature of @xmath0 reactions can be seen in tev neutrinos for sufficiently small dissipation radii .",

    "a smaller magnetic field is assumed , so that ic emission from re - accelerated / heated leptons , which is expected around @xmath157 , become more prominent .",
    "the effect of the ic emission is generally non - linear , and the dependence on @xmath138 is demonstrated in figure  6 .",
    "one can see that , for larger values of @xmath138 , more particles are re - accelerated / heated and lose their energies via the ic emission . as a result , more gamma rays are attenuated and cascaded , which enhance the extra hard component and also provide more seed photons for the photomeson prediction .",
    "the different efficiency for ic emission results in the variety of the high - energy spectral index @xmath158 , which is from @xmath159 to @xmath160 in figure  6 .",
    "one also sees that @xmath138 can not be too small to have sufficiently large gamma - ray luminosities in the mev range , but the result is not so sensitive as long as @xmath138 is large enough .",
    "note that , the other sub - parameter , @xmath111 , affects the flux ratio of the broken power - law component to the power - law - like cascade component rather than @xmath138 , since more leptons can be injected to the re - acceleration / heating process for smaller @xmath111 .",
    "we do not show such other cases because of the onerous calculation time involved , but our qualitative results are not much altered by these sub - parameters as long as @xmath161 and @xmath138 is large enough .",
    "this is because the timescale for remaining above @xmath111 would be close to the diffusion timescale in energy space , @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , it would not be extremely large ( @xmath163 ) , unless the contribution from primary electrons become relevant .",

    "in this paper we studied the role of stochastic acceleration ( or wave heating ) on the grb prompt emission , in the presence of electromagnetic cascades . as an example , we employ the hadronic model to initiate cascade processes .",

    "( 2 ) it is possible to avoid the fast cooling problem because the charged leptons are slowly heated by turbulence . when the leptons are injected via the hadronic processes , we may not have a potential issue on injection of primary electrons in the shock acceleration mechanism .",
    "( 3 ) an extra hard component , @xmath58 , which has often been observed above @xmath196  mev , can be explained by cascade emission , such as in proton - induced cascades .",
    "the existence of the extra component is an important feature of the cascade initiated by high - energy injection well above mev energies .",
    "although we have considered one - zone cases , dissipation will occur at various radii , which can affect the high - energy spectrum .",
    "as shown in appendix b , in slow heating scenarios via stochastic acceleration , the high - energy photon spectrum can be harder than in the one - zone case because of the superposition of one - zone slow - heating spectra . as a result",
    ", the broadband spectral shape can be a broken power law up to @xmath4  gev energies .",
    "such multi - zone effects are even more important above @xmath197  gev .",
    "smaller @xmath114 opacities at larger radii generally smear out the @xmath114 pair - creation cutoff  @xcite .",
    "note that , in our calculation method ( where spectra are obtained via iteration ) , the radiative transfer effect in the emitting slab , which leads to @xmath198 rather than the exponential cutoff , is not included . also , time - dependent and geometrical effects introduce additional complications , and the pair - creation break can be higher  @xcite . hence , we expect that the extra component extends to higher energies , although details are beyond the scope of this work",
    ".    one of the observational properties found by _",
    "fermi _ is the delayed onset at gev energies .",
    "it is not so obvious how to explain this in our model .",
    "however , there are several reasons that may lead to broader pulses at high energies .",
    "especially , multi - zone effects seem important .",
    "as expected from the above , the cascade component as well as the slow heated component would be superposed by dissipation at various radii .",
    "also , gamma rays from outer radii would be more transparent , which could make a dominant contribution at gev - tev energies .",
    "in addition , in the hadronic models , neutron beams from the inner radius make further gamma rays via neutron decay and photomeson production with low - energy photons produced by dissipation at the outer radius .",
    "leptons may also up - scatter the mev emission from inner radii via the external ic process .",
    "in addition , in our model , emissions on timescales longer than @xmath72 and @xmath199 are expected . even after the dynamical time",
    ", the residual energy of electrons would be released by the external ic process and synchrotron radiation in some residual magnetic field . in the hadronic models ,",
    "further hadronic reactions may also happen as the escaping cosmic rays diffuse in the residual magnetic field ( although they are adiabatically cooled ) .",
    "hence , future refinements based on multi - zone calculations seem necessary .    all hadronic models have typically several caveats or open issues .",
    "they often lead to the requirement of a high baryon loading , which may be problematic , although this is motivated mainly by the grb - uhecr hypothesis .",
    "another potential issue is the radiative efficiency . in our cases ,",
    "we typically obtain the reasonable radiative efficiency , @xmath200 , although the apparent radiative efficiency can be higher due to lower @xmath111 , release of the cosmic rays , residual emission and subsequent internal collisions . despite these concerns ,",
    "there are interesting features .",
    "importantly , the hadronic model seems testable by upcoming multi - messenger observations .",
    "the high - energy neutrino signal is one of the most important signatures , since the neutrino luminosity is expected to be comparable to the extra hard component .",
    "if this extra component is ubiquitous and it carries @xmath148  % of the total gamma - ray energy , icecube would detect this signal in multi - year observations .",
    "it is also important to check whether the extra hard component is common among all grbs . as of now , its detectability with _",
    "fermi _ is limited and the current analyses suggest that the gev emission has less than @xmath15  % of the mev emission .",
    "therefore , in order to unravel the properties of the high - energy emission , deeper observations via detections with cherenkov detectors such as magic and veritas should be important , even though detections from distant grbs become difficult due to the attenuation by the extragalactic background light .",
    "although very - high - energy photons from grbs have not been firmly detected so far , the future cta  @xcite and hawc are anticipated to change this situation .",
    "we note that , although we have focused on the hadronic model as an example of high - energy injection , our results can be applied to other models , e.g. , such as magnetic dissipation . in the slow heating scenario resulting from stochastic acceleration ( or heating ) , it seems common to have hard low - energy photon indices , @xmath2 and @xmath201 .",
    "this feature itself would not be changed by details of the high - energy injection , as long as slow heating can operate and the mev peak comes from balance between acceleration / heating and cooling .",
    "hence , as for the origin of stochastically accelerated ( or heated ) particles , one may think of other high - energy injection processes and subsequent cascades .",
    "if magnetic dissipation such as reconnection accelerates electrons up to very high energies and subsequent cascades are developed , similar spectra would be obtained .",

    "<S> we study effects of particle re - acceleration ( or heating ) in the post - shock region via magnetohydrodynamic / plasma turbulence , in the context of a mixed hadronic - leptonic model for the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , using both analytical and numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we show that stochastically accelerated ( or heated ) leptons , which are injected via @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions and subsequent pair cascades , are plausibly able to reproduce the band function spectra with @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the @xmath4  mev range . </S>",
    "<S> an additional hard component coming from the proton - induced cascade emission is simultaneously expected , which is compatible with observed extra power - law spectra far above the mev range . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the specific implications of hadronic models for ongoing high - energy neutrino observations . </S>"
