    "we assume the coefficients of friction are uniform along the snake , and define the forward direction as that with the smaller of the tangential friction coefficients ( if @xmath64 ) , so @xmath65 by definition . for real snakes , @xmath66 , which means that the snake s inertia is negligible compared to frictional forces  @xcite .    for simplicity",

    "an explicit derivation of the equations of motion is given in appendix  [ appen : a ] .",
    "since @xmath74 only depends on the direction of the velocity , and no inertia term is present in the equations , the only time scale in the problem is @xmath60 . for a given @xmath73 ,",
    "if @xmath60 is doubled , the speed of the motion is reduced by half , but the snake will trace exactly the same trajectory , as does purcell s three - link swimmer in stokes flow .",
    "this is referred to as the _ rate independence _ or _ time invariance _ of inertialess systems : if a body undergoes a deformation , the trajectory traveled by the body between two different shape configurations does not depend on the rate of deformation , but only on the sequence of deformation  @xcite . on the other hand , the scallop theorem indicates that inverting the shape change sequence corresponds to inverting time for the original shape change sequence ( note this is _ not _ equivalent to time invariance ) .",
    "a corollary  @xcite is : in the body - fixed frame , the velocity of the center of mass is proportional to the velocity of the shape change .",
    "this is known as the _",
    "kinematic reconstruction equation _ in the geometric mechanics literature @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a shape change vector for systems with multiple degrees of freedom , @xmath77 is the _ local connection matrix _ , which is an @xmath78 matrix that relates an @xmath79 shape change velocity @xmath80 to an @xmath81 velocity of @xmath12 in the body frame @xmath82 .",
    "for the two - link model , @xmath59 is a scalar and @xmath82 is a @xmath83 vector , hence @xmath84 is a @xmath83 vector .",
    "note that @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath80 .",
    "however , equation   does _ not _ apply to our snake model .",
    "this is due to the anisotropy of coefficients of friction , specifically , the heaviside function in the force equation  , that causes the irreversibility of shape change .",
    "instead , for our system , the local connection matrix also depends on the direction ( or _ sign _ ) of @xmath80 , denoted by @xmath85 , but not the magnitude @xmath86 .",
    "if there were no heaviside function in  , and force were only decomposed into tangential and transverse directions , then the system would become very similar to the multi - link fish problem in a potential flow , for which it is known that with the added inertia decomposed into tangential and transverse directions   holds  @xcite .",

    "the _ modified _ kinematic reconstruction equation for the snake model can be written as @xmath87 for the two - link model where @xmath59 is a scalar , the above equation is reduced to @xmath88 .",
    "note when relative angle @xmath73 is prescribed ,   is a nonlinear algebraic equation rather than a differential equation , and the nonlinearity lies in the form of @xmath89 .",
    "the solution of   or equivalently   is the velocity of @xmath12 expressed in the body frame , @xmath82 . without loss of generality ,",
    "assume the snake starts from the origin with zero initial orientation angle , i.e. @xmath90 . the configuration in the inertial frame is then @xmath91 which is an _ iterative _ integral in time since @xmath16 is only known from the integral @xmath92 .",
    "the distance traveled by @xmath12 during one period observed in the inertial frame is given by @xmath93 the work generated by the snake during one period is equal to the energy dissipation due to friction since the system is inertialess , i.e. @xmath94 here it is more convenient to express @xmath74 in the body frame .",
    "the efficiency of locomotion is defined as the ratio between distance and work , @xmath95 this efficiency @xmath96 , after nondimensionalization , is equivalent to the inverse of the _ cost of locomotion _ commonly seen in the animal locomotion literature  @xcite . intuitively speaking ,",
    "@xmath96 is analogous to the concept of  miles - per - gallon \" .",
