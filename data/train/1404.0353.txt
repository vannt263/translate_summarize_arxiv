    "we find that zipf s law approximately holds to a great extent for city areas and to a lesser extent for urban population .    as a matter of fact , characterization of the spatial organization and scaling properties of urban clusters depends on the definition of a city boundary .",
    "in particular , defining a city boundary by means of the cca requires to specifying a distance below which adjacent urban areas are considered to be part of the same cluster .",
    "the variation of this parameter involves a problem similar to percolation transition ; beyond a critical clustering distance value , a giant cluster component emerges .",

    "since a city might include natural gaps , such as the river thames in london or other topographic obstacles , it is convenient to define cities as connected clusters of neighboring populated sites .",
    "this idea has been recently implemented in the so called _ city clustering algorithm _ ( cca ) @xcite , which is an adapted version of the more general burning algorithm @xcite .",
    "basically , cca identifies any pair of adjacent urban spatial units ( either by population or land cover ) as belonging to the same urban cluster if these are located within a distance @xmath6 from each other .",
    "thus , when applied to an entire region , cca provides a mean to determine the areas and boundaries of the cities contained within , according to the parameter @xmath6 , which represents a degree of coarse - graining .    at the global scale , data on the spatial distribution of population",
    "is only available for administrative boundaries or as raster data with a rather coarse resolution .",
    "therefore , we opted for determining the area of cities a remote sensing based classification of land cover data , as provided by the _ globcover 2009 land cover map _",
    "@xcite at a grid resolution of approx .",
    "@xmath7 km ( at the equator ) . from the 23 land",

    "[ fig : illustrative](a ) , the corresponding aggregated land cover classes in fig .  [ fig : illustrative](b ) , and the urban clusters identified after application of the cca in panel fig .  [ fig : illustrative](c ) .",
    "since the raster cell size decreases from the equator to the poles , the use of the euclidian metric is not suitable for the application of cca at the global scale .",
    "accordingly , orthodromic distances were considered in a new implementation of the cca in order to provide a more accurate representation of distances and areas across different latitudes on a sphere . in the orthodromic representation , a distance determined in terms of the latitude  @xmath8 and longitude  @xmath9 coordinates",
    "is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 with the radius of the terrestrial sphere  @xmath12 km .",
    "with the aim of addressing the global city size distribution , we applied cca with a clustering distance of @xmath13 to the entire global land cover database referred to in sec .",

    "[ fig : zipfglobal](b ) deviation from the power law distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq : zipf ] ) at the lower end .",
    "therefore , the power law fitting is carried out for urban clusters above @xmath24 inhabitants , resulting in an exponent @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , we observe that zipf s law approximately holds for the cities on the global scale , whereas the actual exponent is smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "we explore also @xmath27 km and similar power - law size distributions , however with a different exponent in the case of the areas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zipfglobal](a ) ) .",
    "studies of global population city size distributions were reported in @xcite , for a reduced subset of cities , e.g.  the @xmath28 largest clusters in the case of the former .",
    "distributions of city size in terms of _ area _ has been considered previously , e.g.  in @xcite at the regional and country scale .",
    "more recently , a global analysis has positively tested zipf s law by considering temporally stable night lights as a proxy indicator for human habitation and anthropogenic land use @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that when the clustering parameter @xmath6 is set to a very small value the cca does not take any effect , in the sense that the urban clusters thereby identified correspond trivially to those observed from the input land cover map . on the other hand , in the opposite limit of very large @xmath6 ,",
    "most of the urban area under scope are assigned to a same giant cluster component .",
    "accordingly , when applied to a large area , for intermediate values of @xmath6 it is expectable to observe a percolation transition of the urban clusters .",
    "as it turns out , it becomes natural to inquire into this possibility and to eventually address the spatial properties drawn from application of the cca in the light of concepts and methods stemming from percolation theory @xcite .    at the country scale ,",
    "let us address the possible percolation transition that may occur at the level of the urban patch clustering when changing the parameter @xmath6 in a typical application of the cca  which , more in general , constitutes a problem inherent to the ambiguous character of the definition of city boundaries @xcite .",
    "it is in order to mention that the scale defined by the clustering parameter @xmath6 determines the type of percolation transition under scope  for small @xmath6 , the transition resembles the one occurring in site percolation on a square lattice , while for large @xmath6 it can be further assimilated to the one observed in continuum percolation problems @xcite . here",
    ", we are interested in the value @xmath29 at which the giant cluster component spans within a country territory .",
    "the critical value @xmath29 is analogous to the critical occupation probability @xmath30 , which constitutes the control parameter in most of lattice percolation formulations @xcite .",
    "both quantities are approximately related by @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    in real world data , however , it can be difficult to identify such an @xmath29 percolation threshold .",
    "we find that the average cluster size excluding the largest cluster , @xmath33 , constitutes a sensitive indicator of the transition . in infinite systems",
    ", @xmath33 diverges at @xmath30 @xcite  in case of finite systems a ( finite ) peak occurs .",
    "similarly , one can in principle detect the presence of a peak in @xmath34 around a value @xmath29 when applying cca to the urban land cover of different countries . since in the limit of small @xmath6",
    "the urban clusters identified by the cca approximate the cells of urban land cover , we conjecture that a small @xmath29 value constitutes a proxy indicator of the percolation threshold of the urban land cover .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "let us consider the case of austria .",
    "figure  [ fig : perccol](a ) depicts the plot of @xmath33 vs.  @xmath6 .",
    "as it can be observed , for @xmath35 the average cluster size increases strongly with  @xmath6 , yet gradually , and it drops sharply for @xmath36 . in the case of austria we find that the peak occurs at @xmath37 km .    in a model based on correlated percolation @xcite the urban / non - urban structure is formed from spatial correlations , i.e. the probabilities of two sites being urban / non - urban are more similar the closer they are .",
    "furthermore , a radial decay of density around the city center is assumed .",
    "a similar approach has been recently applied to reproduce the scaling properties observed in urban land parcels @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and characteristics of the percolation transition of the urban land cover has been investigated also by means of diffusion limited @xcite and gravity based @xcite stochastic aggregation models of city growth .",
    "let us now consider the influence of the coarse - graining used in defining a city cluster , i.e. parameter @xmath6 in the cca , on the scaling of the city size distributions . at this stage , we stress the fact that for many countries @xmath29 can not be identified unambiguously ( see e.g.  inset of fig.[fig : taylor](b ) ) , as for instance in the presence of multiple peaks  often a signature of large clusters being disconnected by vastly extended topographic heterogeneities . therefore , we focus on a selected set of countries exhibiting ( i ) a clear percolation threshold and ( ii ) a large number of urban areas .    for a given @xmath6 value",
    "we extract all city cluster areas @xmath38 and estimate the corresponding exponent @xmath39 by applying the method proposed in @xcite and testing power - law against log - normal .",
    "thus , we first quantify the pointwise log - likelihood ratios between the fitted power - law and fitted log - normal distributions and then apply the voung test for non - nested models @xcite .",
    "this test essentially consists in testing the hypothesis that both distributions are equally far away from the true distribution , against the two alternative cases where either of each distributions is closer to the true distribution than the other one .",
    "consequently , we account only for those cases where the fitted @xmath39-values results in positive voung test and where the associated one - sided p - value exceeded @xmath40 ( which corresponds to a significance level of @xmath41% ) . for this procedure we used the corresponding r code ( available at http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/\\textasciitilde aaronc / powerlaws/[http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/\\textasciitilde aaronc / powerlaws/ ] ) .",
    "we vary @xmath6 and repeat the procedure to obtain @xmath42 .    figure  [ fig : perccol](b ) shows the probability density @xmath15 , as obtained for the same country as in fig .",
    "[ fig : perccol](a ) for two different values of @xmath6 ( for illustrative purposes , normalized histograms with logarithmic binning are shown ) . the fitting results in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , for @xmath45 km and @xmath46 km , respectively .",
    "similar decreases in @xmath4 are also found for other countries ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perccol](c ) ) . from these fndings",
    ", we conjecture an approximately logarithmic dependence on the ratio @xmath47 , with @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 . we can not determine the exact value for @xmath51 , since the sample sizes become small and the estimated @xmath4 unreliable .",
    "note that the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : perccol](c ) do not fully collapse , in the sense of @xcite , i.e.  the curves do not fall on the identical line , from which we learn that there must be other influences beyond our analysis , such as heterogeneities in the urban land cover .",
    "another possible explanation for this could be measurement errors in the estimation of @xmath39 and @xmath29 .",
    "we stress the fact that the size distributions of urban land cover clusters appear to agree with the functional form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zipf ] ) , independently of the distance to the percolation threshold @xmath29  in contrast to the case of uncorrelated percolation where a power - law size distribution of clusters emerges only in the close vicinity of the transition threshold @xcite .",
    "decreasing @xmath4 with increasing @xmath6 has also been reported for the usa @xcite . moreover , a recent study of a `` gravity '' based urban growth model @xcite has shown that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents the site occupation probability . depending on the values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , this expression leads to a similar decay as in fig .",
    "[ fig : perccol](c ) .",
    "this similarity suggests a generic influence of the proximity to the percolation threshold on the power - law size distribution of urban land cover .      according to percolation theory ,",
    "the average cluster size of finite clusters , @xmath33 , i.e.  disregarding the largest cluster , scales with the proximity of the occupation probability to the critical probability , @xmath57 , where the exponent @xmath58 is universal and only depends on the dimension @xcite .",
    "it is of our interest to explore whether the percolation of the urban land cover clustering exhibits a similar scaling . since in our analysis",
    "only few clusters remain above the percolation transition , we omit the case @xmath36 and study @xmath33 as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : amscaling ] shows the results for austria and denmark . due to the finite size of the countries ,",
    "@xmath33 does not diverge for @xmath60 and we see a plateau . in the other limit , @xmath61 for large @xmath62 . in between",
    "we find a regime approximately following a power - law @xmath63 in general , we did not find a universal behavior as in random percolation , in the sense that the values obtained for @xmath58 can strongly differ among countries .",
    "for instance , for austria , least squares fitting provides @xmath64 and for denmark @xmath65 . such a variability in the @xmath58 values can result from measurement errors in the identification of @xmath29 ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : perctrans ] ) or due to systematic structural influences occurring at larger scale , such as the presence of spatial correlations or an accidented topography . moreover , in some countries",
    "the plot of @xmath33 vs.  @xmath6 does not exhibit a clear power law relation .",
    "on one hand , the log - log plot of @xmath33 vs @xmath6 can appear as composed by many linear segments , or , furthermore , the presence of a power - law - like segment can not even be adequately prescribed over a substantial range of @xmath6-values .      beyond the behavior of the average size with @xmath6 , characterizing the scaling properties of urban clusters",
    "requires also to attend to statistical regularities occurring at the level of the variability of the cluster sizes .",
    "for this purpose we elaborate on an empirical relation first established in the context of ecology , the so called taylor s law @xcite . in systems satisfying taylor s law , the standard deviation and the average of a quantity are related by a power - law .",
    "both quantities are either temporal or over ensembles . according to @xcite , in the case of temporal variability it follows either a linear or square - root scaling .",
    "for a recent review on this topic we refer to @xcite .    in the case of cities ,",
    "we consider the standard deviations and average of cluster sizes for a given @xmath6 , i.e.  @xmath66 and @xmath67 , whereas we omit the largest cluster ( this is necessary since at least for @xmath36 it is an outlier ) . by varying @xmath6 , the ensemble of cluster sizes and the hypothesized power - law can be investigated .",
    "@xmath68    in fig .",
    "[ fig : taylor ] we show the results for two example countries ( austria and spain ) .",
    "while the major panels display @xmath69 vs.  @xmath33 , the corresponding @xmath6 can be inferred from the color - coded insets . for austria ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taylor](a ) ) , a power - law regime is found for small @xmath6 , i.e.  @xmath70 km with @xmath71 .",
    "the slope seems to hold up to @xmath72 km but separated by jumps in the standard deviation .",
    "in contrast , for spain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taylor](b ) ) , two different power - law regimes can be seen , the first up to @xmath73 km with @xmath74 and the second one up to @xmath75 km with @xmath76 . for other countries we obtained similar results .",
    "we conclude that taylor s law holds to some extent for city sizes but there is no unique exponent and the scaling regimes are country specific .",
    "nevertheless , we observe a characteristic maximum in the plot of @xmath69 vs.  @xmath33 . in the case of austria , this maximum matches with the percolation threshold @xmath29 . in the case of spain",
    ", the maximum standard deviation is located at the similar position as a small peak in the representation of @xmath33 vs.  @xmath6 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : taylor](b ) ) .",
    "this suggests a relation between the percolation threshold @xmath29 and taylor s law , where the presence of a maximum of the latter could constitute a mean to identify the former .      in the context of the analysis of the scaling properties of city clusters , it is worth stressing the role dynamic processes underlying city growth play .",
    "as shown in @xcite , city cluster size distributions are influenced by the presence of spatial correlations .",
    "the above mentioned gravity based model of urban growth @xcite has illustrated the relation between the degree of compactness of urban clusters and the exponent  @xmath4 of the cluster size distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq : zipf ] ) .    with the aim of addressing the spatial organization of real urban clusters",

    "we elaborate further on the fit @xmath87 as used e.g.  by @xcite in different contexts .    we fit eq .",
    "( [ eq : corfuncpl ] ) to the approximately linear regime of @xmath88 vs.  @xmath89 by means of least squares and eq .",
    "( [ eq : corfplco ] ) by employing non - linear curve - fitting applying the gauss - newton - algorithm ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . while both approaches , eq .  ( [ eq : corfuncpl ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : corfplco ] ) , lead to different exponents  @xmath90 and  @xmath91 , these are both lower than @xmath26 , thereby indicating the presence of long - range correlations .",
    "regarding the relation between the correlation decay and the percolation threshold , it has been shown that long - range correlations can influence the percolation properties @xcite . however , according with @xcite , the influence of correlations on the threshold value is only minor .",
    "for instance , for site percolation on a square lattice @xcite , the site occupation probability threshold has been shown to vary slightly between @xmath92 for the case of no long - range correlation effect ( @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corfuncpl ] ) ) and @xmath94 for the case of strong long - range correlations ( @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corfuncpl ] ) ) . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ ssec : size ] , spatial inhomogeneities can hinder unambiguous identification of the clustering threshold @xmath29 .",
    "since long - range spatial correlations can entail spatial inhomogeneities , quantification the weak influence of correlations on the value of @xmath29 can not be achieved in many cases .",
    "an important aspect in the analysis of cities is their allometry properties , i.e.  the relation between the city sizes ( e.g.  given by population ) and their socio - economic `` functions '' @xcite and structure .",
    "of particular interest in this context is the relation between city size and area @xcite .",
    "thus , we last address the relation between urban cluster population and area . for this purpose , we combine urban land cover data , as provided by globcover , with the pointwise population numbers of the @xmath20 administrative cities included in the grump database .",
    "we match population and area of clusters by summing up for each cluster those population numbers , that are located within the distance @xmath6 to the considered cluster ( similar to the procedure followed in @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : svsa](a ) depicts the obtained relation between area and population .",
    "most clusters are spread around @xmath96 , except clusters with small population which exhibit discreteness ( stemming from the land cover resolution ) and deviate from the power - law . in order to overcome this difficulty",

    "[ fig : svsa](a ) .",
    "it is also necessary to consider that a direct fitting of @xmath100 vs.  @xmath101 and @xmath101 vs.  @xmath100 statistically leads to different results .",
    "therefore , we assimilate @xmath102 to the slope of the longitudinal principal axis of rotation of the cloud of points in the @xmath100 vs. @xmath101 plot , as obtained from the eigenvector analysis of the corresponding tensor of `` inertia '' .    in order to address the dependency of the correlations between area and population on the observational scale ,",
    "i.e.  on the clustering parameter , in fig .",
    "[ fig : svsa](b ) we plot for @xmath103 the pearson correlation values as a function of @xmath6 and consistently find values above @xmath104 with a maximum of approx .",
    "@xmath105 at approx .",
    "@xmath106 km .",
    "figure  [ fig : svsa](b ) also shows the values of @xmath102 .",
    "for very small @xmath6 , highest values are found between @xmath0 for @xmath103 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "for other values of @xmath6 , the slope fluctuates but generally @xmath102 is roughly within @xmath109 and @xmath110 . as it turns out , the results show a sublinear population to area relation , i.e. @xmath111 . in other words , we find that for a given increase in population , the associated increase in area is greater for large cities than for small ones .    while @xcite suggests an evolution of @xmath102 , i.e.  that estimations of @xmath102 are decreasing since the 1940s , our results indicate an @xmath6-dependence of @xmath102 , i.e.  that the value depends on the observational scale , but generally in the lower range of those listed in @xcite .",
    "this is a relevant fact , since , as before mentioned , allometry could be responsible for the scaling of socio - economic quantities with the population of cities , including urban co@xmath112-emissions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have elaborated on the influence exerted by the degree of coarsening resolution that is inherent to the definition of city boundaries , on a set of indicators of the scaling , spatial organization , and allometry aspects of urban clusters . for this purpose",
    "we implemented a version of the city clustering algorithm that takes the curvature of the globe into account and apply it to global satellite based information on the global urban land cover , in combination with pointwise information of populated units worldwide .",
    "our results show that , at the global scale , zipf s law is found to approximately hold to a great extent for the areas of urban clusters and to a lesser extent for the corresponding population .",
    "a shortcoming is the error introduced by automatized identification of urban areas from satellite imagines as inherent in the land cover data used in this study . as a matter of fact , the climatological , vegetational and structural variety of urban clusters on the globe can hinder their classification , e.g.in globcover data kabul city is not classified as urban . for a recent alternative analysis of size distributions of city clusters on the global scale we refer to @xcite .    at the country scale , we addressed the percolation transition that may occur , at the level of the urban cluster definition , when coarsening the resolution considered to identify urban clusters .",
    "this information is relevant as a proxy indicator for detecting the proximity to the percolation transition occurring eventually on the real land cover of large urbanized areas  which in turn could exert influence on important factors of the sustainability , such as urban heat island effect ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , landscape fragmentation , water surface run - off and floods control , among others . as a matter ,",
    "identifying an urban clustering percolation threshold can become a cumbersome task , due , for instance , to spatial inhomogeneities in the distribution of urban clusters at the large country scale .    in this work we used as an indicator the behavior of the average cluster size , excluding the largest one , which itself provides a suitable characterization of urban clusters , for different levels of coarsening - resolution .",
    "this analysis was applied to selected country cases , for which we addressed the linkage between the scaling of urban cluster sizes and the degree of resolution used for their definition .",
    "our results appear to be at a certain degree consistent with recent results obtained numerically in a simple gravity - based urban growth model . beyond the scaling and average size , characterization of urban clusters",
    "requires addressing the scaling of deviations of cluster sizes around the average .",
    "in particular , for the selected country cases , we illustrate the validity of taylor s law between average urban cluster sizes and their standard deviations .",
    "moreover , we show that strong deviations from taylor s law can be readily used to identify threshold values in proxy indicators of the percolation transition of urban clustering , in cases where the average cluster size fails .",
    "regarding the spatial organization of urban clusters in selected country cases , we find the presence of long - range correlations decaying as a power law with exponential cut - off",
    ". however , for densely urbanized areas we find that a power - law decay is further significative , as compared to the fitting of a power - law with exponential cut off .",
    "finally , our results on the relation of area to population indicate that for a given increase in population , the associated increase in area is greater for large cities than for small ones .",
