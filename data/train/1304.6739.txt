    "alignment of dust grains by magnetic fields causes the thermal emission from dust to be polarized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the angles of dust polarization measurements at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are generally considered to be perpendicular to the magnetic field due to a number of alignment mechanisms ( particularly radiative torques , @xcite ) , allowing for an estimate of the magnetic field direction in the plane of the sky .",
    "magnetic pressure can support clouds against collapse , though other processes , e.g. , ambipolar diffusion , can allow gravity to eventually overwhelm magnetic support .",
    "the importance of magnetic fields in star formation is not well understood ( e.g. , weak- versus strong - field models , @xcite ) , but observations of the plane - of - sky magnetic field morphology can provide insight into the coupling of magnetic fields with cores , disks , and outflows .",
    "although flux - freezing during gravitational collapse is expected to create an hourglass morphology in the magnetic field lines , there has only been one detection of a full hourglass around a low - mass protostar to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , several high - mass star formation regions have clear hourglass detections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "large , submillimeter surveys of various star - forming clouds and cores have been performed with single - dish polarimeters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sharc - ii polarimeter ( sharp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory , is one of the newer submillimeter polarimeters and allows for dual - beam ( simultaneous observations of horizontal and vertical polarization components ) polarimetric measurements .",
    "previous millimeter - wavelength interferometric polarimetric maps have been produced with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) , the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) , and the submillimeter array ( sma ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we present polarimetric observations from sharp and carma of the protostar l1157-mm in the dark cloud l1157 .",
    "l1157-mm is a low - mass class 0 source ( i.e. , the youngest of protostars ) with a large bipolar outflow spanning about 5@xmath2 @xcite and a perpendicular 2@xmath2 flattened envelope @xcite . though the distance to the source is a bit uncertain , with estimates ranging from 200 to 450  pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt a distance of 250  pc @xcite .",
    "these observations trace the magnetic field structure within the core and throughout the infall envelope ( which , given the adopted distance , could extend to 30 - 40@xmath0 ) of l1157-mm . in this letter",
    "we will examine how the continuum and the magnetic field morphologies correlate with other structures in l1157 , such as its outflow and flattened core , and will estimate the field strength .",
    "with sharp and carma we create polarimetric maps that show the fractional linear polarization , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are stokes parameters ) and the angle with respect to the plane of the sky , @xmath7 ( measured counterclockwise from north ) .",
    "when making uncertainty cuts based on polarization , we used polarized intensity , @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 . due to the only positive nature of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , de - biasing these values is necessary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and was done for all observations .",
    "polarimetric observations of l1157-mm were made with sharp in september of 2008 .",
    "these observations were at 350 @xmath1 m ( resolution of @xmath1110@xmath0 ) and were mosaicked in a chop / nod observing mode .",
    "the sharp data reduction is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the total integration time on l1157 is about 15.8 hours ; due to constant chopping , the integration time on the source is closer to 7 hours .",
    "carma observations of l1157 in full - stokes mode at 1.3  mm were first made in the e - array ( @xmath114.6@xmath0 resolution ) in july 2011 as a carma summer school project .",
    "additional observations in the d- ( @xmath112@xmath0 ) and c- ( @xmath110.8@xmath0 ) arrays were obtained over the next year as part of the tadpol ( telescope array doing polarization ) key project ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an additional d - array summer school observation was also added in june 2012 .",
    "the carma dual - polarization system is capable of measuring all 4 cross - correlations simultaneously through the circularly polarized feeds and full - stokes correlator .",
    "the reduction process for the data in this paper is explained in @xcite . for l1157-mm ,",
    "the flux calibrator was typically mwc349 , but when this source was unavailable , we used mars or neptune .",

    "carma vectors have a definitive hourglass shape , with the hourglass axis nearly coinciding with that of the outflow ( figure [ fig2.eps ] ) .",
    "we note that the difference between the hourglass axis and the outflow axis ( a proxy for rotation axis ) is about 15@xmath12 for l1157 because they defined the outflow direction as the line connecting the two brightest co(2 - 1 ) peaks , whereas we follow @xcite , which uses the midline of the outflow cones . ] .",
    "we do not discuss the reason for this discrepancy , though we note that kwon et al .",
    "( in preparation ) discusses the possibility of two jets ejected from l1157-mm , and our hourglass is tilted toward the more co - bright ( and probably more massive ) jet .",
    "we note that the northwest sharp vectors also coincides better with the co - bright jet ( within @xmath1115@xmath12 ) than the entire outflow ( within @xmath1130@xmath12 ) .    .",

    "negative contours are not shown .",
    "[ fig2.eps ] ]    as seen in figure [ fig1.eps ] , we also find that for both carma and sharp observations , @xmath9 is significantly less toward the center of the object , which is typical in polarimetric observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "several factors may contribute to lower central fractional polarization , such as : ( 1 ) averaging along the line of sight is more likely to smear out the polarization through the thickest part of the source , ( 2 ) de - polarization at higher density , and ( 3 ) different grain populations at the center .      to compare sharp and carma values ,",
    "we smooth the carma data to a beam size of 10@xmath0 to provide accurate comparison between wavelengths .",
    "we find that the central vectors have @xmath9=@xmath21% , @xmath7=@xmath22 for sharp and p=@xmath23% , @xmath7=@xmath24 for the carma data .",
    "these vectors are our only point of comparison , and the angles are consistent with each other .",
    "this central angle is also consistent at all carma resolutions ( see figure [ fig3.eps ] ) .",
    "studies have attempted to explain polarization spectra observed in various molecular clouds . @xcite",
    "present @xmath25/p[350]$ ] values at wavelengths , @xmath26 , of 60 , 100 , 850 , and 1300 @xmath1 m .",

    "our value of @xmath9[1300]/@xmath9[350 ] @xmath15 5.4 does not fit well within this polarization spectrum .",
    "however , comparisons of single dish and interferometric fractional polarization should be made with caution ; e.g. , with varying polarization across the source , the interferometer tends to resolve out stokes @xmath4 more than stokes @xmath5 or @xmath6 , causing @xmath9 to be overestimated .",
    "additionally , we only have one point of comparison .",
    "when a cloud with initially parallel magnetic field lines collapses and flux - freezing holds at least partially , the field becomes pinched into an hourglass morphology . according to ambipolar diffusion low - mass star formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hourglass size may range from the size of the protostar cloud core ( a few hundred to a few thousand au ) to the size of the protostar infall envelope ( up to about 10,000 au ) .",
    "our observations probe resolutions from @xmath11300 - 2250 au and will provide a diagnostic of the size scale of the pinch .    from our combined carma observations ,",
    "we apply 3 different gaussian tapers to the visibility data which , along with the non - tapered data , probe 4 different resolutions ( 1.2@xmath0 , 2.1@xmath0 , 3.0@xmath0 , and 4.5@xmath0 ) as seen in figure [ fig3.eps ] .",

    "given our sensitivity , we also show yellow vectors for 1.5@xmath27./@xmath28=1 , we notice that the scatter from the morphology is typically small ( @xmath2910@xmath30 , indicating we have overestimated errors and/or vectors are not independent ) .",

    "the hourglass pinch becomes the most obvious at higher resolution .",
    "carma contour levels are the same as in figure 1 .",
    "the rms error , @xmath19 , for each of the four panels is 0.94 , 1.02 , 1.79 , and 2.58 mjy / bm respectively . [ fig3.eps ] ]    parts of the hourglass morphology can be detected in the lower resolution maps , but the full hourglass becomes evident in the two higher resolution plots .",
    "sharp data , however , fail to see a definitive pinch even when considering lower @xmath19 detections ( the entire low-@xmath19 sharp polarization field is not shown in this letter ) .",
    "the resolution at which the @xmath32 hourglass morphology becomes apparent at 1.3  mm is approximately 2.1@xmath0 or 550  au .",
    "we note that this size - scale is highly uncertain ( particularly due to distance and signal to noise ) , though it is roughly consistent with the 290  au resolution probing the hourglass in @xcite , assuming a distance to ngc  1333 of 235  pc @xcite .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field can not be measured directly from dust polarization maps ; however , different methods allow for estimations .",
    "the standard technique for calculating magnetic fields from polarimetric maps is the chandraeskar - fermi ( cf ) technique @xcite and modifications of the method .",

    "while this particular hourglass is nearly aligned with the outflow , the tadpol survey results have shown that in general , magnetic field lines are consistent with being preferentially misaligned ( perpendicular ) or randomly aligned with respect to outflows @xcite .",
