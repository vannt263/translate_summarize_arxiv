    "in recent years , a number of charmonium - like states , the so - called @xmath0 mesons , have been found at b factories and other experiments ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these states all lie above the open charm ( e.g. @xmath19 ) thresholds , and the observed masses and decays make the identifications of these new states very puzzling . apart from the conventional charmonium ,",
    "many exotic candidates , such as molecules , tetra - quarks and charmonium - hybrids , are suggested . however , despite many exciting hints , none of the exotic states has been firmly established so far , and more theoretical studies are needed to explain the existing data and to confront new experimental tests . in the domain of conventional charmonium ,",
    "one of the main difficulties to assign the new mesons as excited charmonia is that the observed masses do not fit the predictions of potential models with linear confinement potential ( the quenched potential ) .",
    "however , the situation can be more complicated than the simple potential model calculations by including the coupled channel effects , or the string breaking effects .",
    "these effects could make the masses of higher charmonia lower than the potential model predictions .",
    "one distinct example is the state @xmath20 observed in the two - photon process  @xcite , which is now identified with the @xmath21 charmonium @xmath22 , but its mass is about 40 mev lower than the prediction given by the quenched potential model  @xcite .",
    "another example is the @xmath8 observed in double charmonium production in @xmath10 annihilation  @xcite , which is likely ( though not necessarily ) to be the @xmath23 spin - singlet charmonium state @xmath24  @xcite , but this assignment will imply that the mass of the @xmath23 pseudoscalar charmonium is smaller than the prediction given by the quenched potential model by about 100 mev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the quenched potential model may overestimate the masses of charmonia in the energy region well above the open charm thresholds .",
    "although very successful in the prediction of the charmonium spectrum below the open - charm threshold , it is well - known that the quenched potential model , which incorporates a coulomb term at short distances and the linear confining interaction at large distances  @xcite , will not be reliable in the domain beyond the open - charm threshold .",
    "this is because the linear potential , which is expected to be dominant in this mass region , will be screened or softened by the vacuum polarization effects of dynamical fermions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this screening effect has not been directly detected with the standard wilson loop technique in the unquenched lattice calculations .",
    "the reason might be that the wilson loop operator almost decouples from the physical ground state at a large lattice distance that consists of two disjoint strings  @xcite .",
    "in other words , to simulate the screening effect out with the wilson loop technique needs a very long lattice time , which might be too far beyond the ability of the simulation at present . on the other hand , the screening or the string breaking effect has been demonstrated indirectly by the investigation of the mixing of a static quark - antiquark string with a static light meson - antimeson system in @xmath25 lattice qcd  @xcite",
    "this effect is also confirmed by the calculations within some holographic qcd models  @xcite recently .",
    "however , since the simulations of lattice qcd still have large uncertainties and difficulties in handling higher excited states , in order to investigate the screening effects on the charmonium spectrum it should be useful to improve the potential model itself to incorporate the screening effect , and compare the model predictions with experimental data .",
    "such screened potential models  @xcite were proposed many years ago in the study of heavy quarkonium and heavy flavor mesons , as well as light hadrons@xcite . in recent years",
    "the screened potential models have again been used to investigate the heavy quarkonium spectrum and leptonic decay widths  @xcite .",
    "in addition to heavy hadrons , the spectra of light hadrons have also been investigated with the screened potential@xcite , and it is argued that the large degeneracy observed in the excited meson spectrum by the crystal barrel collaboration in proton - antiproton annihilation in the range 1.9 - 2.4 gev@xcite may indicate the flattening of the confinement potential due to the color screening effects@xcite . on this point , it is important to further examine experimentally whether or not the linear regge trajectory of the meson spectrum can hold for even higher excited mesons .",
    "more complete data are needed in the future to clarify the issue of the light meson spectrum regarding the color - screening effect .",
    "although no definite conclusion can be drawn at present , it is certainly useful to study the color - screening effects on the mass spectra for both heavy and light hadrons , especially for the newly discovered higher excited states .",
    "the effect of vacuum polarization due to dynamical quark pair creation may also be compensated by that of the hadron loop induced by virtual @xmath26 meson pairs in the so - called coupled - channel model  @xcite , for charmonium system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compared the coupled - channel model with the screened potential model in charmonium spectrum in the mass region below 4 gev . with the same quenched limit",
    ", the two models are found to have similar global features .",
    "it is not surprising since , in the quark - meson duality picture , the two models may describe roughly the same effects . in practice ,",
    "calculations with the screened potential model are simpler to deal with , though detailed predictions for the spectrum can be somewhat different from the coupled - channel model  @xcite .    in this paper , we calculate the mass spectrum of the charmonium especially the higher charmonium using a non - relativistic schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential plus a screened linear potential which is nearly the same as that in  @xcite but with slightly different parameters  ( see sec .",
    "ii for details ) .",
    "spin - dependent interactions are considered perturbatively .",
    "with one additional screening parameter @xmath27 , the model predicts that the masses of higher charmonium are lowered , compared with the quenched linear potential , and this mass suppression tends to be strengthened when the charmonium states vary from lower levels to higher ones .",
    "for instance , we find that the calculated mass of @xmath28 is 3937 mev , fitting well the experimental value of @xmath20  @xcite , and the mass of @xmath3 is close to the observed @xmath2 . consequently",
    ", this mass spectrum will leave more room for new assignments for some of the observed @xmath18 states in the charmonium family .",
    "these possible assignments will be suggested and discussed in detail in this paper .    in the following , we first introduce the screened potential model in sec.ii , and then study some decay and transition processes of charmonia in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we will discuss possible assignments for the observed charmonium(-like ) states .",
    "a summary will be given in sec .",
    "as a minimal model describing the charmonium spectrum we use a non - relativistic potential model with screening effect being considered  @xcite .",
    "we use a potential as @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath27 is the screening factor which makes the long range scalar part of @xmath32 flat when @xmath33 and still linearly rising when @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the linear potential slope , and @xmath36 is the coefficient of the coulomb potential .",
    "figure 1 . shows the screened potential departure from linear in large length with the parameters given in ( [ para ] ) .    for hyperfine interactions",
    ", we only consider the spin - dependent interactions which include three parts as follows .",
    "the spin - spin contact hyperfine interaction is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is usually taken to be @xmath39 in nonrelativistic potential models , but here we take @xmath40 as in ref.@xcite since it is an artifact of an o@xmath41 expansion of the t - matrix  @xcite in a range comparable to @xmath42 .    the spin - orbit term and the tensor term take the common forms : @xmath43 and @xmath44 these spin - dependent interactions are dealt with perturbatively .",
    "they are diagonal in a @xmath45 basis with the matrix elements @xmath46 @xmath47/2\\ ] ] and the tensor operator t has nonvanishing diagonal matrix elements only between @xmath48 spin - triplet states , which are @xmath49 for the model parameters , we take @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are essentially the strong coupling constants but at different scales .",
    "the former is for large distances and used to determine the spectrum while the latter is for short - distances and used for qcd radiative corrections in charmonium decays ( see below in next section ) . here",
    "@xmath27 is the characteristic scale for color screening , and @xmath53 is about 2 @xmath54 , implying that at distances larger than @xmath53 the static color source in the @xmath55 system gradually becomes neutralized by the produced light quark pair , and string breaking emerges . with these values of the parameters for the potential",
    ", we can calculate the spectrum of the charmonium system .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ spectrum_table ] .",
    "for comparison , we also list the experimental values  @xcite and those predicted by the quenched potential model  @xcite in table  [ spectrum_table ] .",
    "the electronic decay width of the vector meson is given by the van royen - weisskopf formula  @xcite with qcd radiative corrections taken into account  @xcite .",

    "the results of non - relativistic linear potential model  @xcite marked by nr are listed for comparison .",
    "our results for the e1 transition widths of @xmath73 are slightly larger than those of the nr s mainly due to the relativistic phase space factor of @xmath85 involved in the nr s in  @xcite , where @xmath86 is the final state charmonium total energy , and @xmath87 is the initial state charmonium mass . both @xmath73 and nr s results of e1 transitions are larger than experimental values , but we see that in @xmath74 the predicted widths get decreased and fit the experimental values rather well as long as the first - order relativistic corrections to the wave functions are included .",

    "the mass of @xmath1 in our model is 3937 mev , which is consistent with the experimental value in ( [ m : z3930 ] ) , whereas the mass in the quenched potential model  @xcite is larger than the experimental one by 40 - 50 mev ( see tabel  [ spectrum_table ] ) .",
    "as we have mentioned , this is one of our motivations to reexamine the charmonium spectrum in the screened potential model .",

    "@xcite ( the mass was set to be 3931 mev ) , and the total width is predicted to be 35 mev with the branching ratio @xmath94 .",
    "together with the data in ( [ product - width : z3930 ] ) , one can get the two - photon decay width of @xmath20 as about 0.16 - 0.33 kev , which is consistent with the predicted value 0.23  kev for @xmath1 in our mode ( see tabel  [ twophoton ] ) .      before the discovery of @xmath15",
    ", there are only four well - established charmonium states above the @xmath88 threshold .",
    "they are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath2 .",

    "the experimental di - electron width of @xmath96 is @xmath105 kev , larger than that expected for a pure d - wave state , which is probably due to mixing with the @xmath106 state induced by the coupled channel effects as well as by the tensor force . in the following we assume @xmath107 and @xmath108 to be admixture of @xmath109 charmonium states and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mixing angle",
    ". this angle can be estimated by comparing the experimental values of the di - electron widths of @xmath96 and @xmath112 with theoretical predictions for pure @xmath113 and @xmath106 states ( see table  [ tab : ee ] ) .",

    "note that @xmath118 is consistent with the results of refs .",
    "the s - d mixing may be more serious for @xmath98 ( with @xmath119 0.07  kev@xcite ) , if one assign it as the @xmath120 state , since its observed di - electron width is comparable to that of @xmath97 ( with @xmath121 0.07  kev@xcite ) . extracted from the ratio of di - electron widths of @xmath98 and @xmath97 , the mixing angle between @xmath120 and @xmath122 can be as large as @xmath123 in our model and @xmath124 in refs .",
    "moreover , there could also be mixing between @xmath125 states .",
    "this indicates that the observed di - electron widths for higher charmonia ( above the open charm threshold ) can be altered by the s - d mixing effects due to coupling to the decay channels .",
    "moreover , their masses can also be modified by the s - d mixing .",
    "the open - charmed decays of these states are not studied in this paper .",
    "however , one may expect that the corresponding calculations and results in our model will be similar to those in the quenched potential model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors evaluated the open - charmed decay widths of these states using the @xmath126 quark pair creation model , and the results are consistent with experimental measurements both for the total widths and the decay patterns . especially , they predicted that the main decay modes of @xmath2 ( as @xmath4 in their model ) are @xmath127 and @xmath128  , and the @xmath128 mode was confirmed by belle s measurement  @xcite recently .",
    "the lesson from both the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurement is that the higher excited charmonia tend to decay into excited charm mesons rather than the s - wave charm meson pairs .",
    "this might be due to relativistic suppression and the node structures of the wave functions of the higher excited states .",
    "the vector state @xmath131 was first discovered by the babar collaboration  @xcite as a relative narrow peak around 4260 mev in the @xmath132 distribution in the initial state radiation ( isr ) process @xmath133 .",
    "this state was also observed by cleo  @xcite and belle  , and there is also a relative broad structure near 4.05 gev , the so - called @xmath134 , in the belle data .",
    "recently , babar  @xcite updated their measurement and gave the mass and width of @xmath131 which are consistent with belle s measurements  .",
    "however , babar has not yet seen the structure around 4.05 gev .",

    "these @xmath5-states are interpreted totally or partly as exotic states , such as @xmath138 hybrid  @xcite , @xmath139 tetra - quark state  @xcite , bayonium  @xcite and molecule  @xcite . as the only exception , in ref.@xcite the y(4260 )",
    "was interpreted as the @xmath4 charmonium . recently , in ref .",
    "the authors assigned @xmath140 and @xmath3 to the @xmath141 and @xmath142 states , although the predicted masses are higher than the experimental values by 50 to 100 mev .",
    "the situation changes greatly in our screened potential model . in the earlier calculations@xcite ,",
    "the mass of @xmath4 was just around 4260 mev , the mass of y(4260 ) .",
    "since the predicted higher chamonium spectrum is compressed in the screened potential model , there is enough space to accommodate these @xmath5-states .",
    "specifically , in the model of this paper the masses of @xmath4 , @xmath140 and @xmath143 ( see table  [ spectrum_table ] ) are predicted to be 4273 , 4317 and 4608 mev , which are roughly compatible with the observed masses of @xmath131 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "the small mass discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data may be either due to the experimental errors or , more likely , due to the theoretical uncertainties , especially the complicated s - d mixing effects , such as the mixing among @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 states .",
    "the di - electron widths of the pure @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 states in our model are 0.97 , 0.044 and 0.49 and kev , respectively .",
    "experience about the large s - d mixing ( especially between @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) discussed in the last subsection tells us that the large s - d mixing may change these di - electron widths to moderate values . assuming the di - electron widths of @xmath131 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 to be all about 0.4 to 0.5 kev",
    ", one can extract the branching ratios @xmath150 from the experimental measurements  .",
    "they are all about @xmath151 and the corresponding widths @xmath152 mev .",
    "these widths look too large compared with @xmath153 kev  @xcite .",
    "however , once the higher charmonium lies well above the open charm threshold , the di - pion transition rate may be enhanced dramatically by final state interactions between charmed mesons , which are produced in the decay of the charmonium .",
    "this is similar to the case in the @xmath154 di - pion transitions  @xcite , where the rescattering effects between @xmath155 mesons are expected to play a crucial role in enhancing the di - pion transition rates of @xmath154 into @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore , if the broad structure @xmath134 is indeed due to @xmath97 as well as @xmath98 , we will have a clear experimental hint for the large di - pion transition rates of 3s as well as 2d charmonium , which are well above the @xmath157 threshold .",
    "it is useful to emphasize that for all the four newly discovered @xmath5 states the measurements _",
    "ee(y)b(y^+^-)o(10  ev),[yeebr ] where @xmath158 means @xmath159 or @xmath160 , and the measured total widths of about @xmath161 altogether may imply that they have similar properties .",
    "therefore a coherent interpretation for these four @xmath5 states is needed .",
    "a likely explanation is that they are conventional charmonium states , though other interpretations are also possible and even more interesting .",
    "note that in the hybrid scenario if one of @xmath5 states , e.g. , the y(4260 ) is the @xmath162 hybrid , then one needs to understand why the others , which can no longer be accommodated as @xmath162 hybrids in this mass region , have similar properties to the y(4260 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are some considered difficulties to assign @xmath5 states as conventional charmonia , and the most serious one to assign y(4260 ) as the 4s - dominated charmonium seems to be the observed dip rather than a peak in the @xmath163 value scanned in @xmath10 annihilation  @xcite around y(4260 ) ( this difficulty is common to all resonance interpretations of y(4260 ) ) . a possible explanation for the dip is the destructive interference between the continuum and the resonance .",
    "if without any resonance in this region , the continuum contribution should be generally smooth .",
    "another difficulty is the nonobservation ( not a peak but a dip observed ) of the decay modes @xmath164 at the y(4260 ) ( for a recent report by babar see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the dip in the observed charmed meson pairs is probably related to the dip in the @xmath163 value , since the latter is the measurement of the hadron production cross section in @xmath10 annihilation .",
    "the dip in @xmath163 is just the reflection of the dip in the resonance decays to hadrons ( only the charmed hadrons are relevant here ) .",
    "they may all be caused by the interference effects .",
    "moreover , the above mentioned difficulties are not only for the charmonium assignment but also for other interpretations of y(4260 ) .",
    "one needs to understand the dip in @xmath163 around y(4260 ) if one tries to interpret y(4260 ) as a resonance no matter which kind of resonance it is .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to search for decay modes involving the p - wave charm mesons e.g. @xmath165 and other higher charm mesons , apart from the s - wave charm meson pairs , because the higher charmonium may prefer decays to higher charm mesons or multi - mesons , due to the form factor suppression with higher momentum released in decays to lower charm mesons , and also due to the node structure of higher charmonium state . in this regard , we note that a main decay mode of the @xmath2 is @xmath166  @xcite .",
    "very recently , belle reported a new vector state @xmath130  @xcite which was found as a threshold enhancement in the @xmath167 distribution in the isr process @xmath168 .",
    "the mass and width are fitted to be m(x(4630))&=&4634_-7 - 8^+8 + 5  , [ m : x4630 ] + ( x(4630))&=&92_-24 - 21^+40 + 10  , [ gamma : x4630 ] which are roughly in agreement with those of @xmath142 . assuming that @xmath130 is the same state as the @xmath142 ( @xmath143 in our model ) with the di - electron width of about 0.5 kev",
    ", one can extract the partial width ( x(4630)_c^+_c^-)~10  , [ gamma : x4630 ] i.e. , the branching ratio of about @xmath169 .",
    "such a large baryonic decay width certainly deserves further studying .    to sum up for the discussion in this subsection , our assignments for these newly discovered @xmath5 states appear to be consistent with the 4s , 3d , 6s charmonium mass spectrum predicted by the screened potential model , and other properties may also be understood in these charmonium interpretations .",
    "but the issue is far from being conclusive , and many theoretical and experimental investigations are apparently needed to clarify these assignments with other more interesting interpretations such as hybrids and tetraquarks .",
    "the @xmath15 was first observed by belle  @xcite in the @xmath132 invariant mass distribution in @xmath170 decay as a very narrow peak ( @xmath171 mev ) around 3872 mev .",
    "the mass of @xmath15 in the @xmath172 mode was recently updated by cdf collaboration  @xcite as m(x(3872))=3871.610.160.19  , [ m : x3872 ] which is very close to the @xmath17 threshold @xmath173 mev  @xcite .",

    "recently , belle@xcite updated the measurement on @xmath181 and improved their fitting method and found m(x(3875))=3872.6^+0.5_-0.40.4  , [ m : x3875 ] which is consistent with that in ( [ m : x3872 ] ) .",
    "provided that the two @xmath175-states are the same , one can extract the ratio r_dd^*==92[r : dd * ] from the belle data  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 is widely accepted as a molecule candidate of @xmath17 in s - wave  @xcite since its mass is very close to the @xmath17 threshold .",
    "this assignment can also give a natural explanation of the @xmath182 of @xmath15 and predict the ratio @xmath183  @xcite , which is in agreement with that in ( [ r : psi - omega ] ) .",
    "however , as a loosely bound state of @xmath17 , it should be difficult to be produced in b - decays or in @xmath184 collision at the tevatron .",
    "for example , a model calculation  @xcite shows that in the @xmath185 decay a molecule @xmath15 has a branching ratio @xmath186 , whereas the experimental rate tends to exceed this upper limit .",
    "furthermore , belle collaboration has observed @xmath15 in the neutral channel @xmath187 with 5.9@xmath188 significance and with a rate almost as large as that of the charged channel  @xcite = 0.820.220.05 , which implies that @xmath15 is an isoscalar .",
    "the most serious problem of the molecular model , in our opinion , is that it is difficult for a loosely bound state to radiatively transit into exited charmonium , such as @xmath189 , through quark annihilation or other mechanisms .",
    "model calculations  @xcite predict the ratio r_/=410 ^ -3,[r : psigamma / psigamma : molecule ] whereas the experimental value of this ratio  @xcite is r_/^ex=3.41.4.[r : psigamma / psigamma : experimental ] most of the above problems for the molecular model can be resolved if one can assign @xmath15 as a conventional charmonium . as a @xmath176 state ,",
    "the only candidate is the @xmath190 whose mass is about 3.90 gev in our model ( see table.i ) .",
    "the @xmath191 difference between the predicted mass and the experimental one in ( [ m : x3872 ] ) can be further reduced if the coupled channel effects are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "it is the s - wave coupling of @xmath190 to @xmath17 that tends to lower the mass of @xmath190 towards the threshold of @xmath17 .",
    "this is related to the cusp effect at the @xmath17 threshold@xcite .",
    "the charmonium candidates of @xmath15 were suggested  @xcite soon after it was found .",
    "however , these suggestions were almost given up , after the isospin - violating decay @xmath192 was confirmed . because of the coupled channel effects , the @xmath190 will mix with nearby opened @xmath17 component . such a mixed charmonium model for @xmath15",
    "was proposed in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "differing from the molecular models , the @xmath17 component mixed in the @xmath193 charmonium is just a hadronic description for effects of the vacuum polarization induced by the dynamical quark pair creation and annihilation .",
    "thus , the mixed chamonium is as compact as the conventional charmonium . as a result",
    ", the production rates of @xmath15 should be large and equal in both the neutral and charged channels in @xmath194 meson decays  @xcite .",
    "the production rate of x(3872 ) in @xmath184 collisions at the tevatron should also be large , comparable to that of @xmath195 ( but somewhat reduced due to a smaller @xmath55 norm in the mixed charmonium model of x(3872 ) ) .",
    "using the final state rescattering mechanism , one may explain the isospin violating decay @xmath196",
    "@xcite . the isospin violation , which is implied by the ratio @xmath197 in ( [ r : psi - omega ] ) ,",
    "is expected to be mainly due to the difference between the thresholds of @xmath17 and @xmath198 , and the larger phase space of @xmath199 than that of @xmath200 also favors the @xmath199 decay  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath201 in ( [ r : dd * ] ) may also be accounted for provided that the @xmath15 lies below or just a little amount above the @xmath17 threshold  @xcite .",
    "the e1 transition rates of @xmath190 are sensitive to the relativistic corrections due to the node in the @xmath21 wave function , especially for the one @xmath202 . in our model , after relativistic corrections are taken into account , the transition widths @xmath203 kev ( see table  [ e1rad ] ) .",
    "the corresponding ratio @xmath204 , which is much larger than the one predicted by the molecular model in ( [ r : psigamma / psigamma : molecule ] ) and in rough agreement with the experimental value ( [ r : psigamma / psigamma : experimental ] ) .",
    "different treatments or different parameters in the relativistic corrections can result in very different estimations for the rate of @xmath202 ( 2p-1s transition ) , while the rate of @xmath205 ( 2p-2s transition ) can only be changed a little .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath206 kev , and the corresponding ratio @xmath207 .",
    "thus , in the mixed charmonium model for @xmath15 , the expected range of the ratio may be r_/=1.36.0.[r : psigamma / psigamma : chi - c1 ] if we use the calculated @xmath208 kev as input for @xmath209 , and use the experimental results ( [ r : psi - omega ] ) , ( [ r : psi - gamma ] ) , ( [ r : psi-gamma ] ) , and ( [ r : dd * ] ) , as well as the width of decay to light hadrons ( assuming @xmath210 ) , we will get the total width of @xmath15 to be about @xmath211  kev , which is compatible with the measurement ( it can be further reduced when the @xmath55 norm in x(3872 ) is less than one ) .    the nature of @xmath15 can also be uncovered by the pole structure of the scattering amplitude involving the resonance near the @xmath212 threshold .",
    "this study is also needed to explain the different peak locations of @xmath15 in the @xmath213 and @xmath214 modes .",
    "three groups  @xcite have devoted themselves to this study and the conclusions are quite different .",
    "one group  @xcite conclude that the @xmath15 tends to be a virtual state of @xmath212 , while another group s fit  @xcite favors the loosely bound state explanation .",
    "most recently , with the belle s new data  @xcite , authors of ref.@xcite gave a more systematic study on this topic and found that there may need to be two near - threshold poles to account for the data , one from the @xmath212 component and the other from the charmonium state @xmath190 .",
    "to sum up for the discussion in this subsection , we find that the @xmath16-dominated charmonium interpretation for the x(3872 ) may account for ( i ) the e1 transition rates to @xmath159 and @xmath160 and their ratio([r : psigamma / psigamma : experimental ] ) ; ( ii ) the large production rates in @xmath194 decays and equal rates for @xmath185 and @xmath215 ; ( iii ) the large production rate in @xmath184 collisions at the tevatron ; ( iv ) the isospin violating decay to @xmath216 . moreover , in the screened potential model the mass of @xmath16 is predicted to take a lower value than the quenched potential model .",
    "however , though the mass of @xmath16 can be lowered by coupling to @xmath212 , one can not provide a quantitative explanation for the extreme closeness of x(3872 ) to the @xmath212 threshold ( say , within 0.5  mev ) , which is the most favorable motivation for the molecule interpretation .      the @xmath8 was found by the belle collaboration  @xcite in the recoiling spectrum of @xmath159 in the @xmath10 annihilation process @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "the later was studied further with higher statistics by belle  .",
    "the mass and width of @xmath8 are determined to be m(x(3940))&=&3942_-6^+76  , [ m : x3940 ] + ( x(3940))&=&37_-18^+268  .[gamma : x3940 ] meanwhile , they also found the @xmath9 in the @xmath220 mode in the process @xmath221 with a significance of @xmath222 .",
    "the mass and width of the @xmath9 are given by m(x(4160))&=&4156_-20^+2515  , [ m : x4160 ] + ( x(4160))&=&139_-61^+11121  .[gamma : x4160 ] besides , there is a structure around 3880 mev in the @xmath88 spectrum in @xmath223 .",
    "however , it is too wide to present a resonance shape sufficiently .    both of the two @xmath175-states have large production rates in these processes",
    "this fact implies that the charge parities should be even since the charge odd state associated with @xmath159 needs to be produced via two photon fragmentation , which is expected to be highly suppressed  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the only known charmonium states that are produced in this way are @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226  @xcite , and this double charmonium production phenomenon can be explained in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd @xcite .",
    "the production rates of @xmath8 and @xmath9   are both as large as those of @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "this suggests that the two @xmath175-states could be either pseudoscalar like @xmath224 or scalar like @xmath226 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "the observation that the dominant decay mode of @xmath8 being @xmath227 and the lack of evidence for the @xmath88 decay mode   indicates that it can not be a scalar but can be a good candidate for the @xmath11 .",
    "the main problem is the low mass of @xmath8 as the @xmath11 .",
    "although lower than that in the quenched potential model  @xcite by 50 mev or more , the mass of @xmath11 in our screened potential model ( see table  [ spectrum_table ] ) is still larger than the observed mass ( [ m : x3940 ] ) by about 50 mev .",
    "moreover , the mass splitting between @xmath8 and @xmath97 is larger than that between @xmath225 and @xmath189 , which looks quite unnatural .",
    "but it may be due to the coupled channel effects  @xcite , which will further lower the @xmath11 mass hopefully .",
    "the dominant decay mode of @xmath9 is @xmath220  , and the other modes , such as @xmath88 and @xmath227 , were not seen .",
    "thus the charmonium candidates can be @xmath228 or @xmath12 , whose masses are 4250 mev and 4131 mev in our model prediction , respectively .",
    "evidently , the mass of @xmath9 in ( [ m : x4160 ] ) favors the @xmath12 candidate .",
    "the @xmath12 can not decay into @xmath227 , and the decay @xmath229 is expected to be strongly suppressed by the form factor and the effects induced by the nodes of the @xmath230 wave function , just like the case of suppressed @xmath231 decay  @xcite .",
    "the main problem of this assignment may be why the @xmath232 state is not found in the similar process .",
    "one possible account  @xcite is that the broad peak around 3880 mev in the @xmath88 spectrum   mentioned above could be the missing @xmath232 state , since its mass in our model is about 3842 mev and just lies within the bump ( note , however , that this bump might not be a resonance@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the measurements on angular distributions can be used to test the two possible assignments , @xmath228 and @xmath12 , for the @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we try to incorporate the color - screening ( string breaking ) effect due to light quark pair creation into the heavy quark - antiquark long - range confinement potential , and investigate the effects of screened potential on the spectrum of the charmonium especially the higher charmonium .",
    "we calculate the masses , electromagnetic decays , and e1 transitions of charmonium states in the nonrelativistic screened potential model , and propose possible assignments for the newly discovered charmonium or charmonium - like states , i.e. , the so - called @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we find that compared with the unscreened potential model , the masses predicted in the screened potential model are considerably lower for higher charmonium states .",
    "for example , the predicted @xmath1 mass well agrees with that of the z(3930 ) , and the mass of @xmath3 rather than @xmath4 is compatible with that of @xmath2 . as a result of the compressed mass spectrum in our model , most of the @xmath18 states",
    "might be accomodated in the conventional higher charmonia . in particular , the discovered four @xmath5 states in the isr process , i.e. , @xmath129 may be assigned as the @xmath233 states respectively .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 found in the double charmonium production in @xmath10 annihilation may be assigned as the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states respectively .",
    "based on the calculation of e1 transition widths for @xmath234 and @xmath235 and other results , we argue that the @xmath15 may be a @xmath16 dominated charmonium state with some admixture of the @xmath17 component . the problems encountered in these assignments and comparisons with other interpretations for these @xmath18 mesons are discussed in detail .",
    "we emphasize that more theoretical and experimental investigations are urgently needed to clarify these assignments and other interesting interpretations .",
    "in particular , we hope experiments at besiii and superbelle in the future will be crucially useful in searching for new hadrons including charmonium - like states and testing the theoretical interpretations .",
