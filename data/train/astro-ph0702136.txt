    "galaxies which radiate very large luminosities as infrared dust emission ( l@xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath4l@xmath5 ) are called ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the huge infrared luminosities mean that : ( 1 ) very powerful energy sources , starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , are present hidden behind dust ; ( 2 ) energetic radiation from the energy sources is absorbed by the surrounding dust ; and ( 3 ) the heated dust grains re - emit this energy as infrared thermal radiation . in the local universe ( @xmath1 0.3 ) , the ulirg population dominates the bright end of the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the importance of the ulirg population i.e. the comoving infrared energy density , increases rapidly with increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "identifying the dust obscured energy sources of nearby ulirgs is thus very important , not only to unveil the nature of nearby ulirgs , but also to clarify the obscured agn - starburst connections in the high redshift ( @xmath8 0.5 ) ulirg population , where detailed investigations are difficult with existing facilities .    in nearby ulirgs , it is now widely accepted that the dominant energy sources are compact ( @xmath3500 pc ) , highly dust - obscured nuclear cores , rather than extended ( @xmath9kpc ) , weakly - obscured starburst activity in the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the most important issue is to determine whether the obscured compact cores are powered by very compact starbursts and/or agns , from which strong emission is produced in very compact regions around the central accreting supermassive blackholes .    if a luminous agn is present hidden behind dust in a _",
    "torus _ geometry ,",
    "as inferred for the classical seyfert population ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) , a large amount of energetic agn radiation can escape along the direction perpendicular to the torus , and form the so - called narrow line regions ( nlrs ; antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "nlrs are the sources of strong forbidden emission lines seen in the optical  infrared , and their relative strengths are different from those of a starburst because the spectrum at the ionizing high energy uv range ( @xmath10 @xmath3 912 @xmath11 ) is harder in an agn than in a starburst .",
    "an agn obscured by a torus - shaped dust distribution , with a _ well - developed nlr _ , is thus distinguishable from a starburst galaxy relatively easily , through optical spectroscopy ( classified as seyfert 2 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) or high - resolution infrared spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "since the gas and dust in an agn have angular momentum with respect to the central supermassibe blackhole , an axisymmetric spatial distribution is more natural than spherical geometry . in this case",
    ", the column densities can be high in certain directions ( the torus directions ) , but low in others ( along the torus axis ) .",
    "the classical seyfert - type agn is naturally understood as the population where most of the torus axis direction is transparent to the agn s ionizing uv  soft - x - ray radiation .",
    "however , compared to the classical seyfert agns , ulirgs are known to contain a substantially larger amount of gas and dust in their nuclei @xcite . for a fixed angular momentum , the increased amount of gas and dust results in higher column densities in all directions .",
    "if high density gas / dust blocks the bulk of the agn s ionizing radiation at very small radii ( @xmath1210 pc ) even in the torus axis direction , then no significant nlr will be present .",
    "it is very likely that any luminous agns in many ulirgs exist in this _ buried _ condition , with no obvious seyfert signatures in the optical spectra ( hereafter `` optical non - seyfert '' ) .",
    "studying only agns with well - developed nlrs provides a very incomplete picture of the agn population , and will miss many _ buried _ agns , whose understanding may be essential to clarify the true nature of ulirgs .",
    "an often - used indicator to separate a buried agn from a normal starburst is the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , seen in infrared spectra at @xmath13 = 325 @xmath0 m in the rest - frame @xcite . in a normal starburst ,",
    "uv emitting hii - regions and molecular gas and dust are spatially well mixed .",
    "pahs are excited by far - uv photons from stars , and strong pah emission is produced in photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) , the interfaces between hii - regions and molecular gas @xcite , unless the metallicity is very low @xcite . in a normal starburst ,",
    "the equivalent width of the pah emission is insensitive to level of dust extinction , as both the pah emission and the nearby continuum are similarly attenuated .",
    "thus , a normal starburst should always show large equivalent width pah emission , regardless of dust extinction . near an agn ,",
    "the pahs are destroyed by strong x - ray radiation from the agn @xcite .",
    "if the pahs are sufficiently shielded by obscuration from the x - ray emission of the central agn , the pahs can survive .",
    "however , the pah - exciting far uv emission from the agn will also be attenuated by the obscuration , so in a pure agn without starburst activity , the pah emission will be very weak . instead , a pah - free continuum from hot , submicron - sized dust grains heated by the agn is observed . in a starburst / agn composite galaxy ,",
    "pah emission from the starburst regions is seen , but its equivalent width will be smaller than in a pure starburst , because of the dilution by pah - free continuum produced by the agn .",
    "thus , this pah - based method can be used to disentangle a buried agn from a normal starburst at an obscured ulirg s core .",
    "since the pah emission features are spectrally very broad , low - resolution infrared spectroscopy is adequate .",
    "in addition , ulirgs are by definition bright in the infrared , so that this infrared pah technique can be applied to a large number of ulirgs in a reasonable amount of telescope time , and thus can be a very effective tool to systematically identify the hidden energy sources of ulirgs cores .    using low - resolution infrared spectroscopy",
    ", we also have another powerful tool to distinguish buried agns from normal starbursts in the cores of ulirgs , by investigating the _ geometry _ between energy sources and the gas and dust . in a normal starburst ,",
    "the energy sources ( stars ) and gas / dust are spatially well mixed ( figure 1a ) @xcite , while in a buried agn , the energy source ( the central accreting supermassive blackhole ) is very compact and is more centrally concentrated than the surrounding gas and dust ( figure 1b ) @xcite .",
    "the difference in geometry is reflected in two different ways in the observed low - resolution infrared spectra .",
    "the first is that while the absolute optical depths of dust absorption features in the 310 @xmath0 m range can not exceed a certain threshold in a normal starburst with mixed dust / source geometry ( figure 1a ) , they can be arbitrarily large in a buried agn ( figure 1b ) @xcite .",
    "the second is that a strong dust temperature gradient is found in a buried agn ( figure 2 ) , but not in a normal starburst .",
    "this dust temperature gradient can be investigated by comparing optical depths of dust absorption features at different infrared wavelengths @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present low - resolution 535 @xmath0 m spectra of nearby ulirgs at @xmath1 0.15 , to search for the signatures of optically elusive @xcite buried agns in the cores of ulirgs and to determine the energetic contribution of buried agns . throughout this paper , @xmath14 @xmath15 75 km s@xmath16",

    "the physical scale of 1@xmath19 is 0.34 kpc in the nearest source at @xmath20 0.018 , 1.72 kpc at @xmath21 0.1 , and 2.44 kpc in the furtherest source at @xmath20 0.15 .",
    "our main targets are optically non - seyfert ulirgs at @xmath1 0.15 in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample @xcite . in this 1 jy sample , there are 69 ulirgs at @xmath1 0.15 . based on the optical classifications by veilleux et al .",

    "observations of all the 48 ulirgs were performed using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite onboard spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "all four modules , short - low 2 ( sl2 ; 5.27.7 @xmath0 m ) and 1 ( sl1 ; 7.414.5 @xmath0 m ) , long - low 2 ( ll2 ; 14.021.3 @xmath0 m ) and 1 ( ll1 ; 19.538.0 @xmath0 m ) were used , to obtain full 535 @xmath0 m low - resolution ( r @xmath22 100 ) spectra .",
    "13 out of the 48 sources were in the gto target list ( pi . j. houck , pid = 105 ) , and their archival spectra were analyzed .",
    "the remaining 35 sources were observed through our go-1 program ( pi = m. imanishi , pid = 2306 ) and another go-1 program ( pi = s. veilleux , pid = 3187 ) . the go-1 program by dr .",
    "veilleux covered only sl2 and sl1 .",
    "for these ulirgs , ll2 and ll1 spectra were taken in our go-1 program .    for our program ,",
    "each observation consists of 60 sec @xmath23 2 cycles for sl and 30 sec @xmath23 4 cycles for ll .",

    "the slit widths are 10@xmath245 and 10@xmath247 , respectively , which correspond to @xmath222 pixels for both ll2 ( 5@xmath241 pixel@xmath16 ) and ll1 ( 5@xmath241 pixel@xmath16 ) .",
    "the latest pipeline - processed data products at the time of our data analysis ( s1114 , pbcd files ) were used .",
    "frames taken at the a position were subtracted from those taken at the b position , to remove background emission , mostly the zodiacal light .",
    "then , spectra were extracted in a standard manner using the task `` apall '' in iraf .",
    "apertures with 46 and 45 pixels were employed for sl and ll data , respectively , depending on the spatial extent of individual sources .",
    "then , spectra extracted for the a and b positions were summed .",
    "wavelength calibration was made based on the files of the _ spitzer _ pipeline processed data , named `` b0_wavsamp.tbl '' and `` b2_wavsamp.tbl '' for sl and ll , respectively .",
    "it is believed to be accurate within 0.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "a small level of possible error in wavelength calibration will not affect our main discussions .",
    "since emission from all ulirgs is dominated by spatially compact sources at the observed wavelength , flux calibration was performed using the _ spitzer _ pipeline processed files `` b0_fluxcon.tbl '' ( sl ) and `` b2_fluxcon.tbl '' ( ll ) . for sl1 spectra ,",
    "data at @xmath25 @xmath9 14.5 @xmath0 m in the observed frame are invalid ( infrared spectrograph data handbook version 1.0 ) and so were discarded . for ll1 spectra , we used only data at @xmath26 @xmath3 35 @xmath0 m , because the scatter is large at @xmath26 @xmath9 35 @xmath0 m .",
    "no defringing was attempted .    for flux - calibration",
    ", we adopted the values of the pipeline processed data .",
    "we made no attempt to re - calibrate our spectra using _ iras _ measurements at 12 @xmath0 m and 25 @xmath0 m , primarily because ( 1 ) only upper limits are provided for _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath0 m photometry in a sizable fraction ( @xmath960% ; 31/48 ) of the observed ulirgs and for 25 @xmath0 m data in some fraction ( @xmath2220% ; 10/48 ) of them ( table 1 ) , and ( 2 ) the validity of re - calibrating irs fixed - aperture slit spectra , using the large aperture photometry of _ iras _ , is not obvious for ulirgs which possibly show a non - negligible fraction of spatially extended dim emission outside the irs slit .",
    "hence , the absolute flux calibration is dependent on the accuracy of the pipeline processed data , which is taken to be @xmath320% for sl and ll ( infrared spectrograph data handbook ) .",
    "this level of possible flux uncertainty will not affect our main discussions significantly .",
    "in fact , in the majority of ulirgs with _ iras _ detection at 25 @xmath0 m , the _ spitzer _",
    "irs 25 @xmath0 m flux agrees within 30% to the _ iras _ 25 @xmath0 m data , and the _ spitzer _",
    "irs flux is generally smaller . in a small fraction of ulirgs , _",
    "spitzer _ irs 25 @xmath0 m flux is @xmath2250% of _ iras _ 25 @xmath0 m data , possibly because extended dim emission is important . for ulirgs with _",
    "iras _ non - detection at 25 @xmath0 m , the measured _ spizter _",
    "irs flux at 25 @xmath0 m is always smaller than the upper limit of the _ iras _ data .    for a fraction of the ulirgs , slight flux discrepancies between sl1 and ll2",
    "were discernible , ranging from 10% to 40% .",
    "when the discrepancy is seen , the sl1 flux ( 3@xmath247 wide slit ) is usually smaller than the ll2 flux ( 10@xmath245 ) , suggesting the presence of extended emission in these ulirgs . in these cases we adjusted the smaller sl1 ( and sl2 ) flux to match the larger ll2 flux .",
    "the main part of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature extends @xmath13 = 813 @xmath0 m in the rest wavelength ( e.g. , chiar & tielens 2006 ) .",
    "for ulirgs at @xmath8 0.11 , the feature is not fully covered with sl1 spectra at @xmath26 = 7.414.5 @xmath0 m . even for ulirgs at @xmath1 0.11 , the continuum data at @xmath13 = 1314 @xmath0 m , which are required to estimate the strength of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption , fall beyond @xmath27 14.5 @xmath0 m , outside the wavelength range of sl1 .",
    "thus , for the majority of the observed ulirgs , ll2 spectra are essential to measure the optical depth of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature with a small ambiguity .",
    "appropriate spectral binning with 2 or 4 pixels was applied to reduce the scatter of data points at sl2 ( 5.27.7 @xmath0 m ) for some faint ulirgs , and at @xmath26 @xmath22 10 @xmath0 m for ulirgs displaying very strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption features .",

    "their and our spectra are , in overall , consistent to each other .",
    "the spectra in figures 3 and 4 are suitable for displaying the properties of the 9.7 @xmath0 m and 18 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption features .",
    "however , they are not very useful for pah emission features .",
    "figure 5 presents zoom - in spectra at @xmath26 = 5.214.5 @xmath0 m of optical liner and hii - region ulirgs , to better examine the properties of the pah emission features .",

    "emission at @xmath13 = 12.8 @xmath0 m is also detected ( figures 3 and 4 ) , but it can be attributed to both the 12.8 @xmath0 m pah and [ neii ] emission lines , which are not clearly resolved in our low - resolution spectra .",
    "we thus will not discuss the 12.8 @xmath0 m pah emission feature further .",
    "the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission feature is attributed to an aromatic c - c stretching fundamental @xcite .",
    "it is relatively weak , but is isolated both from other pah emission and from the strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature .",
    "although absorption at 6.0 @xmath0 m due to h@xmath29o ice and at 6.85 @xmath0 m by hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) are present @xcite , their relatively weak nature , compared to the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption , makes it possible to measure the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission strength with little ambiguity . for this reason",
    ", the 6.2 @xmath0 m feature has often been used to measure the pah emission strength in a ulirg @xcite . to estimate the strength of the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission feature",
    ", we adopt a linear continuum determined from data at @xmath13 = 6.1 @xmath0 m and 6.45 @xmath0 m , which is shown as solid lines in figure 5 .",
    "the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission is due to an out - of - plane aromatic c - h bending vibration @xcite . since it is situated close to the peak of the strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption , its flux attenuation can be severe if the pah - emitting regions are highly dust obscured .",
    "thus , its flux relative to other pah features can be a good indicator of the dust obscuration of the pah - emitting regions . to estimate the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah strength , we adopt a linear continuum connecting data points at @xmath13 = 11.0 @xmath0 m and 11.6 @xmath0 m , which is shown as solid lines in figure 5 .",
    "the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature is due to aromatic c - c stretching vibrations @xcite .",
    "although it is the strongest pah emission feature , its substantial wavelength overlap with the broad , strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature makes it very difficult to distinguish between 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission and 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption , particularly for sources showing strong silicate absorption , such as the majority of ulirgs . to reduce the effects of the 9.7 @xmath0 m absorption feature",
    ", we adopt an excess above a linear continuum determined from data at @xmath13 = 7.3 and 8.1 @xmath0 m ( shown as solid lines in figure 5 ) as the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission .",
    "since many previous papers ( e.g. , genzel et al . 1998 ) measured the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah fluxes based on different definitions , readers must be careful when our value is compared with other estimates in the literature . in this paper , although the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah strength is shown for reference , it will not be used when possible uncertainty coming from the effects of the strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature may complicate quantitative discussions .    the 8.6 @xmath0 m pah emission due to in - plane aromatic c",
    "- h bending vibration @xcite is not used in this paper , because it is weak and overlaps with the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption , which make its strength highly uncertain .",
    "other weak pah emission features may be present ( e.g. , @xmath13 = 5.7 @xmath0 m ; spoon et al .",
    "2002 ) , but are not discussed in detail because no new meaningful information is expected to be obtained .    in summary ,",
    "the 6.2 @xmath0 m and 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission features are the main focus of our discussion , and the strength of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature based on our own definition is shown just for reference .",
    "we fit the pah emission features with gaussian profiles , which reproduce the observed data reasonably well .",
    "the observed rest - frame equivalent widths and luminosities of the 6.2 @xmath0 m , 7.7 @xmath0 m , and 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission features , based on our adopted continuum levels , are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the uncertainties coming from the fittings are unlikely to exceed 30% , so once the continuum levels are fixed , the total uncertainties are of this order .      based on our adopted continuum levels , the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature is found in almost all ulirgs , and 18 @xmath0 m silicate absorption is also seen , particularly in ulirgs with strong 9.7 @xmath0 m absorption ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",

    ", a weak absorption tail extends from @xmath13 = 8 @xmath0 m to @xmath930 @xmath0 m @xcite ( see also figure 6a in this paper ) . thus , all wavelengths between @xmath13 = 830 @xmath0 m show excess absorption , compared to the extrapolation of dust extinction curve from wavelengths outside @xmath13 = 830 @xmath0 m .",
    "hence , to accurately estimate the optical depths of the 9.7 @xmath0 m ( @xmath30 ) and 18 @xmath0 m ( @xmath31 ) silicate absorption features , a continuum level must be determined using data at @xmath13 @xmath3 8 @xmath0 m and @xmath930 @xmath0 m . at @xmath32",

    "( the longest part of the irs spectra ) shown as the dashed lines in figures 3 and 4 .",

    "the relative ambiguity of the @xmath30 value is small because the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature is intrinsically strong .",

    "consequently , discussions of the presence or absence of strong dust temperature gradients , based on the relative strength of the 9.7 @xmath0 m and 18 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption features ( figure 2 ) , could also be highly uncertain , if we use @xmath30 and @xmath31 as defined above .",

    "the argument of the geometry based on @xmath33 values are therefore robust to possible increase of dust grain size in ulirgs cores .",
    "we conservatively take ulirgs with @xmath33 @xmath9 2 as candidates for harboring luminous centrally - concentrated buried agns .    individual ulirgs with clearly detectable buried agn signatures based on large @xmath33 values ( @xmath92 ; table 4 ) are marked with open circles in table 6 ( column 5 ) .",

    "we must raise three cautions regarding this method .",
    "first , a @xmath33 value smaller than 1.7 does not necessarily preclude the presence of a luminous agn , because a weakly obscured agn , of course , shows a small @xmath33 value .",
    "the best example is iras 01004@xmath282237 ( @xmath30 @xmath22 0.4 ) , which shows very low pah emission equivalent widths , as expected from an agn - dominated source .",
    "next , we used the threshold of @xmath33 @xmath9 2 , based on the _ observed _ values . for ulirgs with detectable pah emission from modestly obscured starbursts ,",
    "the observed fluxes are a superposition of the emission from the highly obscured cores and the starburst emission ( figure 1c ) , and so the _ observed _ @xmath33 values are reduced compared to the @xmath33 values _ only toward the highly obscured energy sources at ulirgs cores_. since subtraction of the modestly obscured starburst component , using a starburst template spectrum , introduces an additional uncertainty , we do not attempt it . thus , we may miss ulirgs which show large @xmath33 values ( @xmath92 ) _ toward the cores _ but small _ observed _ @xmath33 values ( @xmath32 ) due to the starburst dilution .    finally , a starburst nucleus obscured by foreground absorbing dust ( figure 1d ) can also show a @xmath33 value larger than the threshold determined by the mixed dust / source geometry , because in this case , a foreground screen dust model is applicable . assuming galactic dust properties",
    ", @xmath33 @xmath9 2 corresponds to a@xmath2 @xmath9 2040 mag @xcite .",
    "if ulirgs are the mergers of gas - rich spiral galaxies @xcite , gas and dust in the original galaxies can be quickly transferred to the nuclear regions @xcite . the bulk of possibly newborn stars and resulting dust are also expected to distribute in the nuclear regions .",
    "in fact , most of high density gas , dust , and energy sources ( starbursts and/or agns ) in ulirgs are observed to be concentrated to nuclear cores with @xmath3kpc scale @xcite .",
    "the amount of gas / dust in ulirgs hosts at @xmath9kpc scale ( which are morphologically disturbed ) is unlikely to substantially exceed that of the original merging gas / dust - rich galaxies . in our galaxy ,",
    "a gas - rich spiral , a@xmath2 value is estimated to be @xmath730 mag in an equatorial direction @xcite , and should be much smaller in other directions .",
    "it is thus not easy to produce such a large a@xmath2 value ( @xmath92040 mag ) with dust in a host galaxy , unless the host is viewed from a direction with particularly large dust column density .",
    "although a small fraction of ulirgs with @xmath33 @xmath9 2 may have this geometry ( figure 1d ) , it is very unlikely that the majority do .",
    "a buried agn with centrally - concentrated energy source geometry ( figure 1b ) should show a strong dust temperature gradient ( figure 2 ) , whereas a normal starburst nucleus with mixed dust / source geometry does not , whether it is obscured by foreground dust ( figure 1d ) or not ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the presence of a strong dust temperature gradient thus supports the buried agn scenario , and it can be detected by comparing the optical depths of dust absorption features at different infrared wavelengths @xcite . as figure 2 illustrates , in a buried agn , the dust column density estimated from observations at @xmath13 @xmath9 3 @xmath0 m probes deeper inside of the obscuring material as the wavelength is decreased \\{i.e . , av(3@xmath0 m )",
    "@xmath9 av(10@xmath0 m ) @xmath9 av(20@xmath0m)}. in this geometry , dust with a fixed temperature range from a fixed layer contributes strongly to the observed continuum emission at each wavelength , with a small contribution from other components ( figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , in a starburst / buried agn composite ( figure 1c ) , pah - free continuum emission from the agn - heated dust should be detectable even if its optical depth is larger than unity at a particular observed wavelength , provided the buried agn is intrinsically sufficiently luminous that the flux - attenuated ( e@xmath50 ; @xmath51 1 ) agn - heated dust emission contributes significantly to the observed flux .",
    "this has been demonstrated in the 34 @xmath0 m spectra of the ulirgs iras 08572 + 3915 and ugc 5101 ( @xmath52 @xmath9 5 ; imanishi et al .",
    "2000 ; 2001 ; imanishi & maloney 2003 ) .    on the other hand , in a normal starburst ( figure 1a ) , no significant dust temperature gradient is expected , and so the estimated dust extinction should be similar at different wavelengths \\{av(3@xmath0 m ) @xmath22 av(10@xmath0 m ) @xmath22 av(20@xmath0m)}. since in a normal starburst , emission arises uniformly within an emitting volume , we can typically probe emission with optical depth less than about unity . if the extinction is large enough that the short wavelengths do not probe the whole emitting region , the estimated dust extinction would decrease with decreasing wavelength \\{av(3@xmath0 m ) @xmath3 av(10@xmath0 m ) @xmath3 av(20@xmath0m)}. hence , the relations among av(3@xmath0 m ) , av(10@xmath0 m ) , and av(20@xmath0 m ) are totally different between a buried agn ( figure 1b ) and a normal starburst ( figure 1a ) .    for a buried agn ,",

    "the @xmath34/@xmath33 ( @xmath35/@xmath33 ) ratio is also insensitive to possible changes in dust grain size in ulirgs , because the relative strength of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath33 varies little with varying dust grain size ( figure 6b ) .",

    "may be discovered among galactic sources in future observations .",
    "if ulirgs showed intrinsically smaller @xmath34/@xmath33 ratios than the adopted ratio from gcs3-i , then the small observed ratios in ulirgs would not necessarily require the strong dust temperature gradients .",

    "we here briefly comment on two alternative scenarios which are possible but we believe are unlikely .",
    "first , in a normal starburst with mixed dust / source geometry , if each star is deeply buried in a large amount of _ circumstellar _ dust cocoon , such as a protostar , then a strong dust absorption feature ( @xmath33 @xmath92 ) could be produced .",
    "however , the time scale of such a protostar phase is only @xmath310@xmath54 yr @xcite , which is much less than the typical time scale of a normal starburst ( @xmath55 yr ; moorwood 1996 ) or even the maximum starburst ( @xmath55 yr ; elmegreen 1999 ) , or a ulirg time scale ( @xmath56 yr ; murphy et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that all dust - heating stars are protostars in a significant fraction of ulirgs .",
    "furthermore , this scenario produces no strong dust temperature gradient , and so can not reduce the observed @xmath34/@xmath33 ratio .",
    "second , it may be argued that exceptionally centrally - concentrated starbursts remain a possibility ( figure 1e ) .",
    "however , while starburst galaxies with l@xmath6 = 10@xmath46l@xmath5 are well explained by the mixed dust / source geometry ( brandl et al .",
    "2006 ; see @xmath435.2.4 of our paper ) , there is no reason why starbursts at the cores of ulirgs ( l@xmath6 @xmath9 10@xmath4l@xmath5 ) suddenly change their properties to exceptionally centrally - concentrated nature ( figure 1e ) . furthermore , @xcite studied the cores of seven nearby ulirgs and found that the observed emission surface brightnesses in the majority ( six out of seven ) of these ulirgs cores are very high ( @xmath2210@xmath57 l@xmath5 kpc@xmath58 ) .",
    "even if the energy sources are _ uniformly _ distributed over the cores ( @xmath3500 pc in size ) , the observed surface brightnesses are close to the maximum values seen in the cores of galactic hii regions @xcite . if an _ exceptionally centrally - concentrated _ starburst were the luminosity source in the core of a ulirg , the emission surface brightness of the starburst would have to be extremely high , @xmath910@xmath59 l@xmath5 kpc@xmath58 . among known",
    "star - forming regions , such a high surface brightness could only barely be achieved with a super star cluster , where many young stars are formed within a area of less than a few pc @xcite .",
    "the _ absolute luminosity _ of such super star clusters is , however , only of order 10@xmath60l@xmath5 , and so the super star cluster scenario may work for the centrally - concentrated energy sources of low luminosity ( l@xmath6 @xmath22 10@xmath61l@xmath5 ) galaxy nuclei @xcite . for the centrally - concentrated energy sources at ulirg cores , both _",
    "high emission surface brightness _ and _ large absolute luminosity _ ( @xmath2210@xmath4 l@xmath5 ) are required , making the buried agn scenario the most plausible choice ( soifer et al .",
    "2003 ; their @xmath436 ) .",
    "in fact , known agn populations ( i.e. quasars ) meet these requirements without difficulty , while for the starburst scenario , of order 1001000 super star clusters must be concentrated in a very compact region and such a phenomenon has not been clearly confirmed from observations .",
    "we thus believe that buried agns are the most natural explanation for the centrally - concentrated energy sources at ulirgs cores . the presence of luminous buried agns in many nearby ulirgs agrees with the suggestion by @xcite that the observed lump of the local infrared 60 @xmath0 m luminosity function at the highest luminosity end is due to the agn contribution .",
    "table 6 ( column 7 ) summarizes the strengths of the detected buried agn signatures in _",
    "irs 535 @xmath0 m spectra based on the three methods : ( 1 ) low pah equivalent width ; ( 2 ) large @xmath33 value ; and ( 3 ) small @xmath34/@xmath33 and @xmath35/@xmath33 ratio .",
    "when buried agn signatures in individual ulirgs are consistently found using all or most of the methods , the ulirgs are classified as _ very strong _ buried agn candidates , marked with open double circles .",
    "when buried agns signatures are seen in the first method ( particularly based on the observed ew@xmath37 value ) and/or in the third method , then the ulirgs are classified as _",
    "strong _ agn candidates ( open circles ) .",
    "when the signatures are detected only in the second method and/or low observed ew@xmath38 or corrected ew@xmath37 values ( first method ) , the ulirgs are classified as _",
    "possible _ buried agn candidates ( open triangles ) , because ( 1 ) a normal starburst nucleus obscured by foreground dust in the host galaxy ( figure 1d ) can not be ruled out completely and ( 2 ) the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission strengths in normal starbursts have intrinsically larger scatter ( @xmath435.2.1 ) .",
    "the fraction of ulirgs with _",
    "strong _ buried agn signatures is 16/48 ( 33% ; liner + hii - region ) , 10/28 ( 36% ; liner ) , and 6/20 ( 30% ; hii - regions ) .",
    "when ulirgs with _",
    "possible _ buried agn signatures are included , the fraction increases to 26/48 ( 54% ; liner + hii - region ) , 19/28 ( 68% ; liner ) , and 7/20 ( 35% ; hii - region ) . our careful look at the infrared 535 @xmath0 m spectra suggests that luminous buried agns reside in a much higher fraction of optical non - seyfert ulirgs than previous estimates @xcite .",
    "we stress that the above fraction of luminous buried agns is only for ulirgs classified optically as liners and hii - regions ( i.e. non - seyferts ) , which comprise 70% of ulirgs .",
    "given that 30% of ulirgs show optical seyfert signatures , indicative of luminous agns surrounded by dusty tori , and that the agns are estimated to be energetically dominant in these optical seyfert ulirgs @xcite , the total fraction of ulirgs possessing luminous agns is at least 50% , and possibly @xmath965% , in the whole ulirg sample at @xmath1 0.15 , including both optical seyfert and non - seyfert objects .    finally , in all of the methods employed by us ( @xmath435.2.15.2.3 and 5.2.6 ) , ulirgs classified optically as liners tend to display signatures of luminous buried agn more frequently than those classified optically as hii - regions .",
    "for starburst / buried agn composite ulirgs ( figure 1c ) , it is likely that the optical liner or hii - region classifications are largely affected by the properties of the modestly - obscured starbursts at the exteriors of the ulirg cores , rather than buried agn - related emission , because optical observations can probe only the surfaces of dusty objects . if shocks or superwinds are important in the modestly - obscured starbursts , the optical classification will be liners . if emission from hii - regions is dominant , the ulirgs will be classed as hii - regions . in this case , it is not obvious why two phenomena , a luminous buried agn at the center and shocks in the surface starburst , are correlated .",
    "@xcite found that the emission probed in the optical is dustier in liner ulirgs than in hii - region ulirgs . in a dusty starburst",
    ", shock - related emission can be relatively important in the optical compared to the emission from hii - regions themselves , resulting in optical liner classification .",
    "when a luminous agn is placed at the center of a less dusty starburst , classified optically as an hii - region , the agn emission is more easily detectable in the optical spectrum , making such an object an optical seyfert . on the other hand , when a luminous agn is placed at the center of a dusty starburst classified optically as a liner ,",
    "the agn emission is more elusive in the optical spectrum , so that such an object is classified as an optical non - seyfert .",
    "the observed higher fraction of optically elusive _ buried _ agn in optical liner ulirgs compared to hii - region ulirgs can qualitatively be explained by this scenario .      for ulirgs",
    "which show buried agn signatures and also small pah equivalent widths , the observed fluxes are largely ascribed to agn - heated dust continuum emission .",
    "the resulting luminosity is conserved at each temperature ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we can _ quantitatively _ estimate the absorption - corrected intrinsic dust luminosity heated by the agn ( whole infrared ) , or the absorption - corrected agn energetic radiation luminosity ( x - ray ",
    "uv  optical ) , based on the observed fluxes at @xmath13 @xmath22 10 @xmath0 m and the dust column density toward the 10 @xmath0 m continuum emitting regions inferred from @xmath33 . since in a buried agn , the 10 @xmath0 m continuum emission regions are dominated by fixed layers ( @xmath435.2.3 ; figure 2 ) , the foreground screen dust absorption model is applicable , and the dust extinction corrections are straightforward .    to do this ,",
    "we assume that @xmath33 and the extinction at @xmath13 = 8 or 13 @xmath0 m continuum just outside the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature ( a@xmath62 ) are related with @xmath33/a@xmath62 @xmath22 2.3 @xcite .",

    "the ambiguity of the derived absorption - corrected agn luminosities come from ( 1 ) absolute flux calibration error of the _ spitzer _ irs spectra and slit loss of the compact agn emission ; ( 2 ) possibly different dust extinction curves from the galactic one that we assume ; and ( 3 ) a small contribution from pah - emitting , modestly - obscured starbursts , which decreases the @xmath33 values and increases the continuum flux level , compared to pure emission from the buried agn .",
    "the first error is not significant , approximately 20% or so .",
    "the second uncertainty is more difficult to quantify , but our adoption of @xmath33 reduces the effects of dust grain size change ( @xmath435.2.2 ) . for the third source of uncertainty ,",
    "the effect of the decreased @xmath33 values is more important than that of the increased continuum flux level , because the agn - produced flux at @xmath13 @xmath22 9.7 @xmath0 m is more highly attenuated .",
    "assume for example that the modestly obscured starburst emission contributes 10% of the observed flux at @xmath13 = 8 and 13 @xmath0 m , outside the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature .",
    "the buried agn - produced continuum flux is then only 10% smaller than the observed flux .",
    "for ulirgs with @xmath33 @xmath9 2 ( i.e. , buried agn candidates we are now discussing ) , since the attenuation of the observed flux at @xmath13 = 9.7 @xmath0 m is a factor of @xmath97 compared to the nearby continuum , more than 50% of the continuum at @xmath13 = 9.7 @xmath0 m is produced by the starburst emission .",
    "the true , uncontaminated @xmath33 value _ toward the buried agn _ is larger by a factor of @xmath90.7 than the observed value , so that the correction factor of dust extinction for the agn - heated dust continuum is larger by @xmath930% ( @xmath33/a@xmath64 @xmath22 2.3 ) .",
    "therefore , the small starburst contamination generally results in the underestimate of the intrinsic absorption - corrected agn luminosity . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "the rough agreement between the absorption - corrected buried agn luminosities and the observed infrared luminosities of these ulirgs ( 13 @xmath23 10@xmath4l@xmath5 ) makes it reasonable for us to argue that the putative agns could quantitatively account for the bulk of the observed infrared luminosities , at least for ulirgs with strong buried agn signatures in _ spitzer _",

    "a larger amount of dust around a central agn in a buried agn compared to a seyfert agn surrounded by a torus ( @xmath431 ) can naturally produce a cooler infrared color , because the contribution from an outer , cooler component becomes important , and makes the optical seyfert signatures fainter or even vanish , because even the torus axis direction can be opaque to the bulk of the agn s ionizing radiation .",

    "x - ray observations can be particularly powerful in distinguishing a buried agn from an extreme starburst , because a luminous agn is a much stronger x - ray emitter than any kind of starburst . since the column densities in the cores of ulirgs can be large enough to be compton thick ( x - ray absorption n@xmath71 @xmath9 10@xmath72 cm@xmath58 ) , high sensitivity x - ray observations at e @xmath9 10 kev are particularly desirable .    in a strongly x - ray emitting buried agn surrounded by dense gas and dust , x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ; maloney et al . 1996 ) should develop , rather than the photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) usually seen in a starburst ( a strong uv emitter ) .",

    "the observed flux i(@xmath74 ) is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76(@xmath10 ) is an unattenuated intrinsic flux and @xmath77 is the optical depth at each wavelength , which takes different values inside absorption features and nearby continua outside the features .",
    "we here consider radiation with an intrinsically smooth spectral energy distribution , namely i@xmath78(8 @xmath0 m ) @xmath22 i@xmath78(9.7 @xmath0 m ) @xmath22 i@xmath78(13 @xmath0 m ) , such as expected for dust emission in ulirgs .",
    "the peak absorption optical depth of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature , relative to the nearby continuum at 8 @xmath0 m and 13 @xmath0 m ( which corresponds to @xmath33 and not @xmath30 in our definition in @xmath434.2 ) , is @xmath79 \\\\ & = & \\ln [ \\frac{1 - e^{-\\tau_{cont}}}{1 - e^{-\\tau_{97sil } } } \\times \\frac{\\tau_{97sil}}{\\tau_{cont } } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 refer to the optical depths at the peak of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature and nearby continuum at 8 @xmath0 m and 13 @xmath0 m just outside the feature , respectively .",
    "the @xmath80 value is always larger than the @xmath81 value , because @xmath80 is the superposition of the optical depth for continuum emission and the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature .",
    "the absorption strength of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature , relative to a@xmath2 , is different by a factor of @xmath222 in different directions in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "if we take this into account , @xmath84    the @xmath81 and @xmath80 values can be arbitrarily large with increasing amount of dust ( @xmath85 ) in the mixed dust / source geometry .",
    "the @xmath33 value is an increasing function of a@xmath2 , and the first term in the equation a3 ( @xmath86 ) becomes unity for a very large a@xmath2 value .",
    "thus , the upper limit to @xmath33 is @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain a stringent upper limit of @xmath33 @xmath22 1.7 in this mixed dust / source geometry for any amount of dust .",
    "the @xmath81/a@xmath2 and @xmath80/a@xmath2 ratios can vary substantially with varying dust grain size , because the wavelength difference between the optical v - band and infrared @xmath2210 @xmath0 m is large .",
    "however , the upper limit of @xmath33 in the mixed dust / source geometry is dependent only on @xmath81/@xmath80 , which should be less sensitive to varying dust grain size ( see figure 6b ) , because their wavelengths are very close .",
    "therefore , the above conclusion about the upper limit of @xmath33 in the mixed dust / source geometry should be robust to possible differences in dust grain size between the cores of ulirgs and the galactic diffuse interstellar medium .",
