    "in linear perturbation theory , a perturbed black hole emits waves that are outgoing to spatial infinity and the event horizon . the wave function with this boundary condition",
    "is called a quasinormal mode of the black hole and has a complex frequency , whose imaginary part leads to a decaying behavior .",
    "there are several motivations to study quasinormal modes of black holes .",
    "the original motivation is that quasinormal modes carry carry information of black hole , such as mass , charge , and angular momentum , and may be observed by a gravitational wave detector @xcite .",
    "another motivation comes from a recent argument that the real part of the quasinormal mode frequency may play a role in explaining the quantization of the black - hole area @xcite .",
    "the quantization of the black - hole area , which is believed to be closely related with the microscopic origin of black - hole entropy , is also explained in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "ideas have been suggested to understand the origin of quasinormal modes and various methods have been developed to find quasinormal modes ( for review and references , see refs .",
    "quite recently , i have suggested that the quantum theory of quasinormal modes might be related with a dissipative open system and possibly with black - hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is _ not _ to develop any new method for finding analytically quasinormal modes , _ but _ to exploit the physical interpretation of quasinormal modes of black holes . in particular",
    ", i shall provide some supporting arguments for my recent proposal on the connection of quasinormal modes with a dissipative open system , the feshbach - tikochinsky ( ft ) oscillator , and possibly with the thermodynamics of black holes in a semiclassical approach .",
    "there are some open questions about quasinormal modes and thermodynamics . first , is there any connection between a system of quasinormal modes and a dissipative open system ?",
    "second , is there any connection between quasinormal modes and black - hole thermodynamics ?",
    "it is known that perturbations of a system may provide some information of the system , and , in some cases , may carry all information . then , what black - hole physics can we learn from quasinormal modes ?",
    "let us consider perturbations in a schwarzchild black hole with mass @xmath1 .",
    "the equation for perturbations is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the tortoise coordinate . in the mode decomposition",
    "@xmath4 the perturbation equation is separated as @xmath5 the potential of the schwarzschild black hole is given by @xmath6 where scalar @xmath7 , electromagnetic @xmath8 and gravitational @xmath9 perturbations have @xmath10 , respectively . for instance , fig .",
    "1 shows the first few black hole potentials for the scalar perturbation .",
    "there is a potential barrier for each @xmath11 .     for @xmath12 ( lower graph ) and @xmath13 ( upper graph ) .",
    "]    to obtain the quasinormal mode of the black hole , one imposes a boundary condition such that the mode is an outgoing wave to the spatial infinity and the event horizon .",
    "though many numerical methods have been developed to find quasinormal - mode frequencies ( for instance , see the references in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , exact analytical solutions have not yet been found .",
    "physically , quasinormal modes can be interpreted as a scattering problem as follows : an incident wave with a unit amplitude is partly reflected with an amplitude @xmath14 and partly transmitted through the barrier with an amplitude @xmath15 at asymptotical regions in the tortoise coordinate .",
    "the branches of the wave for the scattering problem can be written as @xmath16 and for the transmitted wave as @xmath17 to have a purely outgoing wave to the spatial infinity and the event horizon , @xmath14 should be singular to make the incident wave negligible compared with the reflected wave , but @xmath18 should be regular to have a finite transmission amplitude .",
    "this means that @xmath15 is also singular .",
    "the consequence of the boundary condition will be discussed in sec . iv .",
    "the quantization of the black hole area was first proposed by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the real parts of quasinormal modes may explain the quantization of the black - hole area .",
    "hod first related the real parts of quasinormal modes with the quantization of the black - hole area by using bohr s correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "the correspondence principle is a semiclassical idea that wave functions with large quantum numbers or actions follow almost classical orbits and exhibit classical behavior and that classical theory can be obtained from quantum theory in this limit .",
    "quasinormal - mode frequencies near the top of the black - hole potential have an asymptotic form @xcite @xmath19 the real parts of quasinormal modes are responsible for the oscillatory behavior and , thus , play the role of the quantum action in the correspondence principle whereas the imaginary parts are responsible for the decaying behavior .",
    "note that @xmath20 . as the mass of the black hole changes by the minimum energy quantum , @xmath21 , the area , @xmath22 , of the event horizon changes by @xmath23 . for a kerr black hole",
    ", one has @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that hod s argument explains the quantization of the black - hole area from a knowledge of quasinormal modes .",
    "kunstatter further noted that the real parts of quasinormal modes are given by the transit time of light across the horizon @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the transit time across the horizon and @xmath27 .",
    "then , according to the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , the adiabatic invariant is related with the entropy of the black hole as @xmath28 thus , the black - hole entropy is given by @xmath29 , and the number of states by @xmath30 .    in the above argument for the quantization of the black - hole area , the real parts of quasinormal modes provide the minimum energy for excitation of the black - hole area .",
    "quasinormal modes have a quantum mechanical analog : a particle confined to a potential well by a finite potential barrier has a complex energy whose real part is responsible for a quasi - stationary state inside the potential well and whose imaginary part gives the decay rate .",
    "both the real and the imaginary parts have physical meanings in quantum theory .",
    "however , the above argument used only the real parts of quasinormal modes .",
    "black - hole potentials in a four - dimensional spacetime are too complicated to allow any analytical method , so one stratagem is to approximate the black - hole potentials by some exactly solved ones .",
    "certain kinds of simulated potentials are known to possess group structures which yield the spectrum through a group theoretical technique .",
    "the physical origin of the discrete set of imaginary parts may be illustrated by an inverted potential model , which approximates the top region of the black hole potential .",

    "note that the quasinormal - mode frequencies of a black - hole potential and the energy spectrum of the inverted oscillator have the same discrete set of imaginary parts up to multiplication factors .",
    "the high - toned quasinormal modes come from a region near the top of black hole potential , which is well approximated by the inverted oscillator .",
    "another exactly solved potential is provided by using a self - similar collapsing scalar field model @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric geometry minimally coupled to a massless scalar field is given by the metric @xmath57 for a self - similar collapse , we use the coordinates @xmath58 or @xmath59 the quantum gravitational collapse is then described by the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite @xmath60 \\psi ( y , \\phi)= 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
