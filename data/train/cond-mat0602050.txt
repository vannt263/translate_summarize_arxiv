    "this behavior of @xmath95 as a function of the density is explained by the fact that , when the density is high enough , a large number of landau levels are filled . in this case , the magnetic field should be considered as relatively weak with respect to the characteristic frequency of the electron gas @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .    when comparing in fig .",

    "the rigorous upper bound for the ground - state energy of an interacting polaron gas in a magnetic field has been obtained in terms of the static structure factor . due to the presence of a magnetic field , the static structure factor as a function of the electron density reveals features related to the filling of the landau levels , when the fermi energy crosses a landau level .",
