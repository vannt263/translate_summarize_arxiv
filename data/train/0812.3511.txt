    "the most looked - for particles on earth at the present time are axions @xcite and weakly interacting massive particles(wimps ) @xcite .",
    "recently , hints on these particles have been reported from outer space sources .",
    "the 10 year old integral data @xcite gives the 511 kev line .",
    "the white dwarf cooling has been suggested by the emission of very weakly interacting light particles(vwlp ) ( mass less than @xmath7 ev ) with a very small coupling strength to electron ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . at present , this white dwarf bound can be considered just as an upper bound , but in this paper we adopt a bold assumption that their best fit corresponds to the existence of a vwlp .",
    "more recently , the remarkable observation of high energy positron excess in the satellite pamela data @xcite hints heavy ( 100 gev  10 tev ) cold dark matter(cdm ) particles @xcite .",
    "since the 511 kev line can be explained by the astrophysical origin , or by the particles of mass @xmath8 @xcite , or by an excited state almost degenerate to the wimp @xcite , in this paper we attempt to understand the latter two of these observations from a grand unification ( gut ) viewpoint of the flipped - su(5 ) @xcite .",
    "the pamela group @xcite reports the high energy positron excess , above 10 gev up to 60 gev , at the level @xmath9 , but has not reported any noticeable excess of anti - protons @xcite .",
    "the charactersistic of the data between 1060 gev is a slightly rising positron flux , which is inconsistent to the lightest supersymmetric particle(lsp ) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) with supersymmetric(susy ) particles at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus , the mssm with @xmath10 lightest neutralino dm component @xmath11 ( ) has to be modified if susy has to be kept for the gauge hierarchy solution .",
    "the minimal extension needs just three two component fermions @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , with the coupling @xmath14 if one tries to introduce more fields around tev scale , certainly the rising positron flux can be explained , but it is very difficult @xcite to explain nonobservation of antiproton flux . this suggests a different treatment of electron from quarks .",
    "indeed , the flipped - su(5 ) gut 1 treats charged leptons differently from quarks @xcite such that the charged lepton is an 1 singlet ,    @xmath15    the specific form of the coupling ( [ eecn ] ) is related to the problems of the yukawa couplings . in this regard ,",
    "we note the five old but fundamental problems on the masses of the standard model fermions .",
    "firstly , there is a hierarchy of the top quark mass @xmath16 gev at the electroweak scale of @xmath17 gev , and the rest of the standard model particle masses are much smaller than the top quark mass , @xmath18 .",
    "second , there is a sizable cabibbo mixing , especially between the first and the second family quarks .",
    "third , the quark mass ratio is reversed in the first family compared to those of the second and the third family quarks , i.e. @xmath19 while @xmath20 and @xmath21 . even though it is not proper to define an inverted mass pattern for leptons",
    ", it looks like that the electron mass is also an inverted pattern because @xmath22 .",
    "fourth , there is a big hierarchy of singlet neutrino mass of @xmath23 gev for the seesaw mechanism @xcite and the electroweak scale of @xmath17 gev . finally , we point out that the sm neutrino mass pattern shows a tri - bi maximal mixing pattern @xcite . except the tri - bi",
    "maximal mixing , in this paper we try to understand the remaining four problems in a flipped - su(5 ) gut .    to have a very light axion implied by the white dwarf data , we introduce a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry u(1)@xmath4 so that the symmetry we consider is extended to 1 times u(1)@xmath4 . to have the inverted mass pattern of the quark mass ratio in the first family , we assign different @xmath24 charges for the first family members and the second and the third family members .",
    "but , to have a large cabibbo mixing , we require q@xmath25 quarks or q@xmath26 quarks mix fully , restricted only by the strength of the corresponding yukawa couplings but without any restriction from the symmetry arguments . in the flipped - su(5 ) , since both the quark singlet @xmath27 and the quark doublet @xmath28 appear in @xmath29 , viz .",
    "( [ fliprep ] ) , it is easy to mix q@xmath26 quarks fully without restrictions from the symmetry arguments .",
    "so , we assign the same symmetry charges for three members @xmath30 .",
    "then , q@xmath26 quarks can be mixed fully as desired .",
    "but the charges of @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be different for different @xmath33 to allow the inverted mass pattern of the quark mass ratio for the first family .",
    "for the singlet neutrino mass problem , we need a large vev , above the axion window of @xmath34 gev .",
    "if there is no other gauge symmetry , the pq symmetry may be broken by this large vev .",
    "thus , we introduce another u(1 ) gauge symmetry which will be called a horizontal gauge symmetry u(1)@xmath35 , distinguishing the first family and the second and third families .",
    "finally , to keep @xmath36 pair at the electroweak scale and to have proton stability and two dark matter components @xcite , we introduce the @xmath37 symmetry and @xmath5 symmetry ( the @xmath37-parity ) .",
    "thus , the symmetry we consider is @xmath38    in this model , the renormalizable couplings are gauge couplings and the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "all the other yukawa couplings are non - renormalizable .",
    "the model we introduce does not have the @xmath39 term of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath39 term is the axion and qcd anomaly coupling , and the pq charges of higgs doublets vanish .",
    "therefore , the very light axion we obtain is not a proper kim - shifman - vainstein - zakharov ( ksvz ) axion @xcite , or the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitskii ( dfsz ) axion @xcite , but can be called a ` variant very light axion ' .",
    "the electron ",
    "axion coupling is known to be small for the ksvz axion , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our case ,",
    "the axion arises from the @xmath40 term of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath40 term is the light quark mass term , through a non - renormalizable interaction , and the electron ",
    "axion coupling turns out to be large . since this ` very light variant axion ' is required to have a large electron coupling , it will be called a very light _ electrophilic",
    "_ axion .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : wd ] , we briefly review the white dwarf bound @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : flip ] , we present a flipped - su(5 ) model , satisfying the criteria presented above . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomenology ] , we discuss the susy phenomenology for the model presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : flip ] .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is a conclusion .",
    "white dwarfs can give us hints about their last stage evolution .",
    "white dwarfs , with the mass range less than @xmath41 , are the fossil stars after consuming all their nuclear fuel . here",
    "the electron degeneracy pressure is the one supporting the gravitational collapse , and the surface temperature ranges down from ten times the solar surface temperature .",
    "the temperature difference between the core and the surface is not greater than 100 k , and hence if the vwlp is produced at the core then its mass can not be much greater than 1 ev . since the white dwarf has a relatively simple structure and its evolution mechanism",
    "is just based on the cooling , its luminosity function has been rather accurately predicted .",
    "thus , if there is a novel energy loss mechanism by a vwlp like axion , it can affect the resulting luminosity function of the white dwarf which can be used to constrain the properties of that particle or give a clue for its existence .",
    "the most strong bound on vwlp comes from the existence of the sharp cutoff at the faint part in the luminosity function ( @xmath42 ) versus the bolometric magnitude ( @xmath43 ) plot .",
    "the sharp cutoff is due to the finite age of our galaxy .",
    "the luminosity function is given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial mass function , @xmath46 is the birth rate of the progenitor star , @xmath43 is the bolometric magnitude , @xmath47 is the mass of the progenitor star and @xmath48 is the characteristic time scale of the white dwarf cooling .",
    "although the luminosity function depends on the birth rate which is not yet exactly known , the bright part of the curve is insensitive to it up to the overall normalization .",
    "thus , one can exploit the bright part to constrain the hypothetical cooling mechanism due to the vwlp .",
    "in this regard , recently the possible energy loss rate has been computed @xcite .",
    "if a very light boson with mass less than 1 ev is produced inside white dwarfs , its coupling to electron is estimated as @xmath49 any boson with this coupling strength to electron can explain the white dwarf evolution _ a la _ ref .",
    "@xcite , using ref .",
    "@xcite .    since axions are well - motivated light pseudoscalar bosons , ref .",
    "@xcite tries to interpret the coupling @xmath50 in terms of the dfsz model @xcite . in",
    "the interior of the white dwarf , the axion bremstralung coming from the axion - electron yukawa coupling , which is significant in the dfsz model but absent in the hadronic axion model , is dominant over the primakoff process .",
    "the energy loss rate per mass with the crystalization effect is given by @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the correction factor due to the crystalization effect and @xmath53 is the yukawa coupling between the electron and the axion .",
    "in the dfsz model , it corresponds to @xmath54 with the domain wall number 6 . from this study , isern et al .",
    "@xcite point out that the small deviations of the white dwarf luminosity function from the standard cooling model can constrain the axion mass @xmath55 mev , and even presented the best fit of the luminocity function with the axion emission for @xmath56 mev . in the dfsz model",
    ", this white dwarf bound on the axion mass corresponds to the axion decay constant @xmath57 gev and the best fit corresponds to @xmath58 gev .",
    "below , we try to construct a flipped - su(5 ) to accomodate the best fit of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the electron axion coupling can be written as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the pq charge of @xmath62 . since the axion mass is given by @xmath63 , the best fit of isern et al .",
    "@xcite in the dfsz model interpreted as the electron  axion coupling in any axion model ,    @xmath64    if the domain wall number is large and the pq charge of electron is 1 , then we need to have a smaller @xmath65 than @xmath66 gev since @xmath67 is required to be @xmath68 . generally , the domain wall number is counted as @xmath69 for any quark carrying the unit pq charge . therefore ,",
    "if only one dirac quark carries the pq charge 1 so that each chirality contributes one unit of the pq charge , then the domain wall number is 1 . in this way",
    "@xcite , the dfsz model gives @xmath70 since there are six quarks , and the electron ",
    "axion coupling is @xmath71 with @xmath72 gev .",
    "there is an interesting case that only one weyl quark carries the pq charge 1 . in this case ,",
    "our formula for the axion ",
    "electron coupling must use @xmath73.).[footdw ] ] in such a model eq .",

    "below we concentrate on the latter possibility in a flipped su(5 ) model , obtaining eq .",
    "( [ aewdcoupling ] ) for the very light _ electrophilic _ axion .",
    "this moves @xmath65 to the supergravity favored scale @xcite even with the large electron  axion coupling envisioned in ref .",
    "so(10 ) gut groups can not realize our idea of ref .",
    ". the so(10 ) gut with the su(5 ) gut assignment @xcite does not introduce our su(5 ) singlet @xmath6 and @xmath75 fields since the electromagnetic charge operator @xmath76 is fully embedded in su(5)@xmath77 .",
    "the flipped - su(5 ) assignment of hypercharge in the so(10 ) subgroup @xcite , namely @xmath78 , allows the su(5 ) singlet ( in @xmath79 ) carrying the electromagnetic charge , and @xmath80 does not belong to @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) generalization of the flipped - su(5 ) chain from so(10 ) , including the vacuum expectation value of higgs field not belonging to the origin of the weight diagram to reduce the rank of the gauge group , has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a simple choice of such symmetry breaking with @xmath83 and @xmath84 from string construction was shown to be possible in the fermionic construction @xcite and in the orbifold compactification @xcite .",
    "also , in the susy flipped - su(5 ) , the doublet - triplet splitting problem is solved elegantly as shown in the fermionic construction @xcite and in the orbifold compactification @xcite .    here",
    ", we do not consider the so(10 ) breaking chain to an 1 gauge group .",
    "the 1 gauge group is considered as an ultraviolet completion gauge group , possibly arising from a compactification of string theory . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the right - handed chiral fields so that the electron singlet is represented as @xmath80 instead of @xmath85 and the quark doublet is represented as @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 .",
    "this right - handed chiral field notation is simpler to discuss the interaction @xmath88 which we try to introduce for the pamela data .",
    "we use the following right - handed notation for representations of the flipped - su(5 ) .",
    "the electroweak hypercharge is @xmath89 where the sm singlet generator embedded in su(5 ) is @xmath90 the representations ( [ fliprep ] ) are consistent with this definition .",
    "the matter field @xmath29 contains the quarks doublet @xmath91 , the quark singlet @xmath92 and the neutral lepton singlet @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath82 contains the quark singlet @xmath94 and the anti - lepton doublet @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 is the charged lepton of the unit charge 1 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to remember that singlets @xmath27 , @xmath97 and @xmath80 are members of @xmath29 , @xmath82 and @xmath96 , respectively .      the singlet neutral direction ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 directions ) of @xmath29 and @xmath100 can be assigned to gut scale vacuum expectation values(vevs ) , breaking su(5)@xmath101u(1)@xmath102 down to su(3)@xmath101 su(2)@xmath101u(1)@xmath103 .",
    "for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the flipped su(5 ) , thus , we need a vectorlike pair , @xmath83 and @xmath104 , which contain the sm singlet components , @xmath98 and @xmath105 .",

    "<S> recently , there are two hints arising from physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> one is a possible energy loss mechanism due to emission of very weakly interacting light particles from white dwarf stars , with a coupling strength @xmath0 , and another is the high energy positrons observed by the pamela satellite experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a supersymmetric flipped - su(5 ) model , 1 with appropriate additional symmetries , [ u(1)@xmath1_{\\rm gauge}\\times$][u(1)@xmath2u(1)@xmath3_{\\rm global}\\times z_2 $ ] , such that these are explained by a very light _ electrophilic _ </S>",
    "<S> axion of mass 0.5 mev from the spontaneously broken u(1)@xmath4 and two component cold dark matters from @xmath5 parity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the flipped - su(5 ) there exists a basic mechanism for allowing excess positrons through the charged su(5 ) singlet leptons , but not allowing anti - proton excess due to the absence of the su(5 ) singlet quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we show the discovery potential of the charged su(5 ) singlet @xmath6 at the lhc experiments by observing the electron and positron spectrum . with these symmetries , we also comment on the mass hierarchy between the top and bottom quarks . </S>"
