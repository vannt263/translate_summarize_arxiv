    "there is significant interest in modelling shallow water flows at the mesoscopic level , either utilising the mesoscopic information or directly simulating at the mesoscopic scale . for the first approach , the gas - kinetic scheme ( gks )",
    "was proposed @xcite , in which a boltzmann type equation with the * * b**hatnagar-**g**ross-**k**rook ( bgk ) is used as an intermediate step to supplement the flux term of shallow water equations ( swes ) @xcite . in the literature",
    ", the gks has been applied for a range of flows including strong shock and dam - breaking problems @xcite . for the second direction ,",
    "the main approach is the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) .",
    "the lbm can be considered as a special case of discrete velocity method ( dvm ) for which a minimal discrete velocity set is sought and tied to the discretisation in space @xcite . in this way , the scheme is sufficiently simple yet powerful enough to handle complex flow problems .",
    "hence , the scheme has also be extended to modelling of the swes@xcite .",
    "a critical challenge for lbm is to simulate supercritical shallow water flows characterised by a high froude ( @xmath0 ) number . for this purpose ,",
    "an asymmetric model is proposed in @xcite for simulating one - dimensional flows with @xmath1 . in @xcite ,",
    "a multi - speed scheme has been proposed recently by matching hydrodynamic moments and applied for both one - dimensional and two - dimensional supercritical flows .",
    "since the discrete velocities are not integers in general , a finite difference scheme has to be used so that the scheme is best classified as a discrete boltzmann model .    in this work ,",
    "we have derived a hierarchy of * * d**iscrete * * b**oltzmann * * m**odels with * * p**olynomial * * e**quilibria ( dbmpe ) from the continuous boltzmann - bgk type equation using the hermite expansion approach @xcite . from this framework",
    ", we can have both integer and non - integer discrete velocity sets , and then we are able to choose either particle - hoping like scheme or general finite difference scheme .",
    "the order of expansion may be easily tuned according to the requirement of the flow to be simulated .",
    "if the depth scale is much less than the horizontal length scale , the water flows are dominated by the nearly horizontal motio and are referred as shallow water flows . for these flows ,",
    "the swes can be employed to simplify the modelling , which are written as  @xcite    @xmath2    and    @xmath3    where @xmath4\\thickapprox h\\nu\\triangle\\bm{v},\\ ] ] and @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) is the unit tensor .",
    "the equations describe the evolution of depth , @xmath7 , and depth - averaged velocity , @xmath8 .",
    "the flows are often driven by a body force , @xmath9 , which mathematically represents not only the effects of an actual body force , including geostrophic force and tide - raising forces , but also those of wind stress , surface slope and atmospheric pressure gradient .",
    "the pressure @xmath10 originates from the hydrostatic assumption , where @xmath11 represents for the gravitational force . if necessary , the viscous term @xmath12 may also be considered where @xmath13 is the depth averaged kinetic viscosity .",
    "as has been shown , the swes can be mathematically analogous to the 2d compressible flow equations .",
    "in fact , it may be considered to be describing an ideal gas flow with a gas state equation eq .",

    "the macroscopic quantities can be obtained by integrating over the whole particle velocity space , i.e. ,    @xmath24    @xmath25    and @xmath26 moreover , the * * r**ight-**h**and * * s**ide ( rhs ) term of eq .",

    "similar to a real ideal gas , the relation between the relaxation time and kinetic viscosity is    @xmath27    which can be obtained by using the chapman - enskog expansion .    in principle , this kinetic equation may be solved directly by using regular numerical discretisation for both physical and particle velocity , i.e. , the so - called discrete velocity method . compared with direct discretisation of swes , there are two more degrees of freedom for the particle velocity , which need to be treated carefully for both accuracy and efficiency . among various schemes ,",
    "the gauss type quadrature can provide a very efficient yet simple to implement discretisation if properly truncating the equilibrium function eq .",
    "( [ eq : swefeq ] ) .",
    "we shall derive a hierarchy of discrete boltzmann models using a hermite expansion @xcite .",
    "however , it is convenient to first introduce a non - dimensional system ,    @xmath28    @xmath29 where the hat symbol denotes the non - dimensional variables . the reference depth , @xmath30 , can be the characteristic depth of the system such as the depth at the inlet ( e.g. , @xmath31 in fig .",

    "we may also define a `` knudsen '' number    @xmath37    and the local froude number becomes    @xmath38    where the velocity magnitude is denoted by @xmath39 . using the `` knudsen '' number and considering the fact that the viscosity is often considered as constant , the rhs term of eq.(@xmath40 ) becomes ,    @xmath41 hence",
    ", the actual relaxation time will change with time locally .",
    "hereinafter , we shall use the non - dimensional version of quantities and equations by default , and the hat symbol will be omitted for clarity .",
    "it is also convenient to use the symbol @xmath42 to substitute for @xmath43 in writing the equations .",
    "first of all , the equilibrium distribution will be expanded on the basis of the hermite orthogonal polynomials@xmath44 in particle velocity space ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail ) , i.e. ,    @xmath45    where the @xmath46 order terms are retained and the coefficient is given yb @xmath47 using gauss - hermite quadrature with weights @xmath48 and abscissae @xmath49 , @xmath50 , the integration in eq .",

    "it is easy to verify that , with an appropriate quadrature , the conservation property of the collision integral will be satisfied automatically using an expansion higher than the first order , which will simplify the algorithm .",
    "the body force term @xmath58 can also be approximated as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the corresponding coefficients for the distribution function , @xmath61 .",
    "the first two are same the @xmath62 and @xmath63 while the higher order terms can be related to stress and heat flux . through the expansion , the kinetic equation ( [ eq : nondimeq ] )",
    "can be rewritten in its truncated form , i.e. , @xmath64 thus , we will be solving an approximation of the original kinetic equation .",
    "the second step is to discretise eq .",

    "once the discrete velocity set is chosen , the governing equation is discretised as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . according to eqs .",

    "we have already constructed a kind of dbmpe . in order to conduct a numerical simulation ,",
    "the physical space @xmath73 and the time @xmath23 are yet to be discretised .",
    "for this purpose , any available scheme may be utilised according to the property of flow , such as an upwind scheme for space discretisation . in particular , if using abscissae consisting of integers , the lattice boltzmann scheme    @xmath74+\\frac{\\tau\\mathcal{f}_{\\alpha}dt}{\\tau+0.5dt}\\label{eq : scheme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    can be constructed by introducing    @xmath75 which allows a kind of particle - hopping like feature .",
    "due to this unique property , the lattice boltzmann method has attracted significant interests in broad areas including shallow water simulations . however ,",
    "if a high - order expansion is used , the abscissae will not be integer in general so that more sophisticated schemes will be required to solve the dbmpe .",
    "for instance , we will use an implicit - explicit ( imex ) scheme below for testing .",
    "we are now ready to discuss a few aspects on the accuracy of dbmpe .",

    "( [ truncatedeq ] ) is expected to accurately recovery eq .",
    "( [ eq : nondimeq ] ) . in practice , however , only a few orders may be affordable in term of computational cost , and the approximation accuracy will be determined by the expansion order . in general , the accuracy will be related to the froude number , i.e. , higher froude numbers may need more expansion terms , cf .",
    "( [ eq : nonswefeq ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fr ] ) .",
    "for instance , similar to gas dynamics , see ref .",
    "@xcite , using a first - order expansion leads to a linear equation which is suitable when @xmath76 .",
    "specifically , we may introduce a @xmath77 norm    @xmath78      +        to measure the displacement of @xmath79 from @xmath80 over the whole particle velocity space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : et ] , the density plots of @xmath81 are shown over the macroscopic velocity range of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for comparison ,",
    "we consider both the second - order expansion and fourth - order expansion of the equilibrium distribution function . from the plots",
    ", we clearly see that the error grows with increasing macroscopic velocities . in particular , with a smaller @xmath7 ,",
    "the error may become relatively large ( note that @xmath81 represents an accumulation of errors from all discrete velocities ) with relatively small macroscopic velocities .",
    "hence , simulations may be more prone to error and instability if there is a sharp horizontal gradient of depth which often induces fast water flow .",
    "interestingly , it appears that a high - order expansion does not necessarily means smaller errors ( see the plots for @xmath84 ) .",
    "this shows complex convergence behaviour of the hermite expansion .",
    "however , since the conservation laws are retained naturally , even with limited expansion order , the dbmpe may be sufficient for a broad range of the hydrodynamic problems , particularly if the diffusion term plays a negligible role .",
    "the second kind of error is from the chosen quadrature .",
    "according to the chapman - enskog expansion , when the `` knudsen '' number @xmath85 is small , the first - order asymptotic solution of eq .",
    "( [ truncatedeq ] ) may be written as    @xmath86    where the zeroth - order solution , @xmath87 , is just the truncated equilibrium function , @xmath79 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1stsol ] ) , @xmath88 will include a polynomial of @xmath89 of one order higher than that in @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , to numerically evaluate the integration of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) to ( [ eq : p ] ) , we need a quadrature with the degree of precision    @xmath90 to calculate the @xmath91 order of moment ( e.g. , @xmath92 for the zeroth - order moment , @xmath7 ) . specifically , if using a @xmath93 order hermite expansion and to get the stress right ( @xmath94 ) , we need at least a quadrature with the @xmath95 order of precision , which may need four discrete velocities .",
    "in the following , we test the scheme by simulating the transient evolution of an initial discontinuity of water level , i.e. , the classical 1d dam - breaking problem . by utilising eq .",
    "( [ approxfeq ] ) , the hemite abscissae and eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) , it is straightforward to construct various discrete velocity sets .",
    "for instance , to capture the strong shock with high froude number , we may need to use a fourth order expansion for @xmath71 and a quadrature of at least @xmath95 order of precision .",
    "in contrast , if the flow is subcritical , then it may be enough to employ commonly used abscissae of nine points and a second order expansion for @xmath71 .",
    "we will test both scenarios .",
    "when the fourth expansion terms are employed for @xmath71 , we use a set of 16 discrete velocities obtained from the roots of fourth order hermite polynomial , see eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) .",
    "these 16 discrete velocities are not integer and require a finite difference scheme . for this purpose",

    "excellent agreement is found for both water depth and velocity with the analytical solution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details of theanalytical solution ) , although numerical error is found for the profile of local froude number at the position of discontinuity due to the phase lag between water depth and velocity caused by numerical diffusion .",
    "the simulations confirms the capability of modelling supercritical flows with a fourth order expansion and corresponding quadrature .",
    "by contrast , we also tested the combination of a second - order expansion and 16 discrete velocities , but found that the simulation is unstable using the same problem setup .",
    "for the subcritical flow , we use the stream - collision scheme ( [ eq : scheme ] ) and the parameters are chosen as @xmath120 while the stream - collision scheme is simpler , it requires a smaller time step for stable simulations due to the stiffness of the right hand collision term when @xmath85 is small .",
    "moreover , since the spatial mesh is tied to the time step , this requirement may cause quadratic increase of computational cost in 2d .",
    "the above parameters present an economic combination which results in very efficient simulations .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4vs1 ] , where excellent agreement with the analytical solutions  @xcite can be found .",
    "moreover , it appears that there is almost no numerical diffusion .",
    "however , possibly due to the low diffusion , the scheme limits the maximum local froude number . using the same expansion order and quadrature",
    ", the scheme ( [ eq : fluxlimiter ] ) can simulate higher froude number in general , in particular for supercritical flow .",
    "to summarise , we have derived a hierarchy of discrete boltzmann models with polynomial equilibria for modelling shallow water flows . utilising the hermite expansion and gauss - hermite quadrature",
    ", the scheme automatically satisfies the conservation property of the collision integral , which greatly simplifies the algorithm .",
    "we also discussed theoretically how to choose the expansion order and quadrature according the requirement of problems ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) , although the hermite expansion shows complex convergence behaviour .",
    "in particular , if the quadrature consists of integer abscissae , we can obtain the very simple and efficient lattice boltzmann scheme .",
    "the derived models are tested using the classical one - dimensional dam - breaking problem , excellent agreement with analytical solutions is found for both supercritical and subcritical flows . in the future , we will further investigate the application for more complicated problems , e.g. , the treatment of force terms .",
