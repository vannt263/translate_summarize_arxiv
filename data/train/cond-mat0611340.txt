    "<S> moreover , unstable ( hyperbolic ) dynamics may be more common due to the stability of chaos with respect to perturbations . it has been argued based on results of numerical analysis @xcite that chaotic dynamics appears to observe the convergence of the classical response functions . in spite of apparent importance , and to the best of our knowledge the problem of the nonlinear response in strongly chaotic systems has never been addressed using analytical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we note that analytical calculations of the response are rarely feasible in nonintegrable systems , whereas numerical simulations of chaotic dynamics are complicated by the exponential divergence of stability matrices @xcite .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> the shape becomes similar to ribbon - like fettuccine : elongated along the unstable direction by a factor @xmath21 , narrowed along the stable one @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 being the lyapunov exponent ) and unchanged along the flow . since @xmath24 results from reverse dynamics , the distributions @xmath25 and @xmath24 are elongated along the unstable and stable directions , respectively </S>",
