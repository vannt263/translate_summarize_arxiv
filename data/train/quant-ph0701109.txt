    "it is a well established experimental fact that the wave and particle aspects of quantum systems are mutually exclusive .",
    "niels bohr elevated this concept , which is probably born out of the uncertainty principle , to the status of a separate principle , the principle of complementarity @xcite .    since then , the complementarity principle has been demonstrated in various experiments , the most common of which is the two - slit interference experiment .",
    "it has been shown that if the which - way information in a double - slit experiment is stored somewhere , the interference pattern is destroyed , and if one chooses to  erase \" the which - way information _",
    "after _ detecting the particle , the interference pattern comes back .",
    "this phenomenon goes by the name of quantum erasure @xcite .",
    "shahriar afshar proposed and carried out an interesting experiment which claims to violate the complementarity principle @xcite",
    ". a schematic diagram of the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "1 . basically , it consists of a standard two - slit experiment , with a converging lens @xmath0 behind the conventional screen for obtaining the interference pattern .",
    "although afshar uses pinholes instead of slits , we will continue to refer to them as slits .",
    "if the screen is removed , the light passes through the lens and produces two images of the slits , which are captured on two detectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "opening only slit @xmath3 results in only detector @xmath1 clicking , and opening only slit @xmath4 leads to only @xmath2 clicking .",
    "afshar argues that the detectors @xmath1 and @xmath1 yield information about which slit , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , the particle initially passed through . if one places a screen before the lens , the interference pattern is visible .    conventionally , if one tries to observe the interference pattern , one can not get the which - way information .",
    "afshar has a clever scheme for establishing the existence of the interference pattern without actually observing it .",
    "first the exact location of the dark fringes are noted by observing the interference pattern .",
    "then , thin wires are placed in the exact locations of the dark fringes .",
    "the argument is that if the interference pattern exists , sliding in wires through the dark fringes will not affect the intensity of light on the two detectors .",
    "if the interference pattern is not there , some photons are bound to hit the wires , and get scattered , thus reducing the photon count at the two detectors .",
    "this way , the existence of the interference pattern can be established without actually disturbing the photons in any way .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the so called  interaction - free measurements \" where the non - observation of a particle along one path establishes that it followed the other possible path , without actually measuring it @xcite .",
    "afshar carried out the experiment and found that sliding in wires in the expected locations of the dark fringes , does nt lead to any significant reduction of intensity at the detectors .",
    "hence afshar claims that he has demonstrated a violation of complementarity .",
    "the complementarity principle is at the heart of quantum mechanics , and its violation will be deeply disturbing to its established understanding . as expected , there has been skepticism towards afshar s experiment , and a heated debate is currently going on @xcite .",
    "however , none of the criticisms has been satisfactorily able to point out any flaw in afshar s interpretation of the experiment .",
    "most agree that if the introduction of wires has no effect on the intensity , it shows that interference exists .",
    "and everybody seems to agree that detecting a photon at ( say ) @xmath1 means that it came from slit @xmath3 .",
    "most have fallen back to a more formal interpretation of bohr s principle , namely that the wave and particle nature can not be seen in the same experiment , for the same photons .",
    "they argue that afshar has to do not one , but two experiments to prove his point - one without the wires , one with the wires .",
    "some argue that afshar already assumes the existence of fringes , and that his argument is circular .",
    "however , a reader who respects empirical facts , does nt see it as two experiments if putting in the wires is not changing the results .",
    "one would say , the interference is out there in the middle , and one check it out that the photons are not passing through certain regions , the dark fringes .",
    "let us understand what is happening in the experiment slightly better by simplifying the experiment .",
    "one might argue that a two - slit experiment is the simplest experiment one can imagine .",
    "but this experiment still has a large number of degrees of freedom , and the hilbert space is big .",
    "we will show in the following that the simplest interference ( thought ) experiment can be just carried out using a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "let there be a spin-1/2 particle traveling along x - axis . for our purpose ,",
    "its physical motion is unimportant - we will only be interested in the dynamics of its spin . in the the two - slit experiment",
    ", the particle emerges from the slits in a superposition of two physically separated , localized wave - packets , which are orthogonal to each other .",
    "their physical separation guarantees their orthogonality",
    ". any subsequent unitary evolution will retain their orthogonality .",
    "we assume the initial state of the spin to be @xmath5 here , the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the eigenstates of @xmath8 , and play the role of the two wave - packets that emerge from the double - slit . the time evolution , in the conventional two - slit experiment , spreads the wave - packets so that they overlap . in our thought experiment , we employ a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath4 , acting along the y - axis , to evolve the two states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath9 .",
    "the time evolution operator can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the usual pauli matrix .",
    "the time evolution operator , for a time @xmath12 has the form @xmath13 it is straight forward to see that the time evolution transforms the states@xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath14 a further evolution through a time @xmath15 will transform the states as @xmath16 after an evolution through a total time @xmath17 , if one puts a spin detector , one will either get a  spin - down \" or a  spin - up \" . in the beginning , if we started out with a state @xmath6 , the detector at the end will register a @xmath7 state . on the other hand , of we started with a @xmath7 state ,",
    "the detector at the end will register a @xmath6 state .",
    "thus , the detector at the end obtains a which - initial - state information about the spin , exactly as the detectors in afshar experiment obtain a which - slit information .",
    "so , now we carry out our thought experiment , with the initial state @xmath18 , as given by ( [ psi0 ] ) . after a time @xmath15",
    "we get into a state which is equivalent to the interference region in afshar s experiment : @xmath19 equation ( [ interf ] ) represents an interference pattern , because the  down - spins \" cancel out to give destructive interference , while the  up - spins \" add up to give constructive interference .",
    "so , in our two - state interference experiment , there is one dark fringe and one bright fringe .",
    "after parts of the states have been destroyed by the  dark - fringe \" , what is left is just @xmath20    now , these two contribution from the two initially orthogonal states are identical .",
    "states which are not orthogonal , are naturally not distinguishable . thus the which - way or which - initial - state information",
    "is lost at this stage .",
    "it might serve some useful purpose by keeping the two contributions separate and evolving them for a further time @xmath15 to see what they yield at the spin detector .",
    "latexmath:[\\[\\hat{u}(\\tau)({1\\over 2}|\\uparrow\\rangle   + { 1\\over 2}|\\uparrow\\rangle ) =   { 1\\over 2\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle -    so , we see that both the initially orthogonal parts of the initial state lead to a superposition of @xmath7 and @xmath6 states .",
    "so , although the spin - detector at the end still gives either a  spin - up \" or a  spin - down \" , it gives no information about whether the initial state was a @xmath7 or @xmath6 .",
    "it is obvious from the simple thought experiment discussed above that interference destroys the which - way information .",
    "one might wonder if this statement is general enough , or if it is an artifact of the over - simplification of the analysis .",
    "let us discuss this point in a bit more detail . in any variant of the conventional two - slit experiment",
    ", the initial state has to be in a superposition of two orthogonal states .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that the two slits are distinguishable .",
    "thus the initial state @xmath18 could be written as @xmath22 .",
    "these states then evolve and reach the region where they interfere .",
    "the time evolution , being unitary , retains their orthogonality .",
    "let us assume that in the region where they interfere , they have the form : @xmath23 and @xmath24 are real and positive , although this requirement is not essential .",
    "here , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 need not be simple states - each may involve a multitude of degrees of freedom",
    ". however , @xmath28 and @xmath29 have to have this form , so that there are parts from the two which cancel out , to give the so - called dark - fringes .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 is orthogonal to both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for the dark fringe to be distinguishable from the rest of the part .",
    "if complementary could indeed be violated , the parts of the two initial states which are left ( after the destructive interference ) , should be orthogonal , so that they can contain a which - way information . in our example",
    ", it would mean that the states @xmath25 and @xmath26 should be orthogonal .",
    "it is trivial to verify that if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are orthogonal , @xmath25 and @xmath26 can never be orthogonal .",
    "this general analysis shows that if interference exists , it necessarily destroys which - way information .",
    "so , complementarity is robust , and can not be violated in any such interference experiment .",
    "coming back to afshar s experiment , let us see what implication the preceding analysis has on it . clearly , in afshar s experiment , after the particle pass through the interference region ,",
    "the which way information is lost .",
    "the detector @xmath1 clicking does nt mean that the particle came from slit @xmath3 .",
    "it might appear hard to visualize that a wave - packet which travels in a straight line from slit @xmath3 can yield a click on detector @xmath2 , which is not in its direct path .",
    "however , the argument of momentum conservation will hold only if we _ knew _ that the particle started out from slit @xmath3 - in that situation it would never reach detector @xmath2 . in order to demonstrate the validity of these arguments for afshar s experiment ,",
    "let us look at the two - slit experiment in more detail .",
    "we carry out the analysis for massive particles , to show that the argument does nt just hold for electromagnetic waves .",
    "consider the particle to be moving along the x - axis , and the slit plane to be parallel to the y - axis .",
    "we will only be interested in the dynamics of the state in the y - direction , whereas the x - axis motion just serves the purpose of transporting the particle from the slits to the detectors .",
    "let us assume that when the particle emerges from the double - slit , its state is given by a superposition of two distinct , spatially localized wave - packets .",
    "the state at this time , which we choose to call @xmath30 , can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the width of the wave - packets , @xmath33 is the slit separation , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the amplitudes of the two wave - packets .",
    "the wave - packets evolve in time , during which they spread , and reach the region where they overlap , and thus , interfere .",
    "this state can just be obtained by evolving ( [ psi0 ] ) , using the hamiltonian @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the state at time @xmath37 can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 now , this state can also be rewritten as @xmath40 where @xmath41 .    in the usual case of a two - slit experiment , the amplitudes coming from the two slits are approximately equal , i.e. , @xmath42 . in this case , the sinh terms cancel out to give the dark fringes , and what is left is @xmath43 in this state , the parts of the state coming from the two slits are equal .",
    "so , there is no which - way information in the state any more .",
    "if a lens is used after this stage , which takes the part @xmath44 to one detector and the part @xmath45 to the other detector , one can easily see from ( [ psit ] ) that a part coming from one slit , becomes a superposition of two parts going to the two detectors .",
    "so , each detectors receives equal contribution from the two slits , and registering a particle gives no information on which slit the particle came from .",
    "a critic might argue that instead of canceling out some parts of the two wave - packets , one might just evolve them separately , and because they were initially orthogonal , they will give distinct result at the end . the answer to that is , if one really looks for interference by putting thin wires , one is blocking those very parts of the wave - packets which are canceling out .",
    "so , those parts will not reach the detectors , even if one insists on not canceling them out .",
    "on the other hand , the argument of bringing in wires is not really needed .",
    "the state ( [ psit ] ) as such , has no which path information .    at this stage",
    "we would like to recall an experiment discussed by wheeler to demonstrate complementarity @xcite .",
    "the scheme of the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "a photon beam is split at a half - silvered mirror @xmath49 .",
    "one part of the beam goes and reflects off the mirror @xmath3 and other reflects off mirror @xmath4 .",
    "the beams cross and there after the detectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 collect the photons . interestingly , wheeler assumes that when the two beams cross uninterrupted , the detectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 give the which path information . from our preceding analysis",
    "it is clear that if there is interference in the crossing region , the two detectors no longer give the which - path information .",
    "wheeler was contrasting this setup with the one where in the crossing region there is another half silvered mirror which mixes the two beams .",
    "wheeler probably did not look into the possibility of an interference in the beam - crossing region . in a general case of the crossing of beams , there will be interference , and consequently , the which - path information will be lost .    in conclusion , although afshar s experiment does have genuine interference , as shown by his introducing thin wires , the detectors detecting the photons behind the converging lens , do not yield any which - way information . many earlier analysis of complementarity",
    "have concentrated on showing how existence of which - way information destroys interference .",
    "we have taken the reverse approach , as demanded by the afshar experiment .",
    "we have shown that the existence of interference necessarily destroys the which - way information .",
    "the complementarity principle is robust and can not be violated in any experiment which is a variant of the two - slit experiment .",
    "we see yet again that in dealing with quantum systems , trusting classical intuition can easily lead one to wrong conclusions ."
