    "the discovery of the sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) thirteen years ago revolutionized our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by uncovering a population of high - redshift , dust - obscured systems that are forming stars at tremendous rates ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ) . in terms of their infrared luminosities ,",
    "the smgs are analogous to the local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) . until recently , deep observations at far - infrared ( fir)/sub - mm wavelengths",
    "have been either limited to relatively small areas of the sky or severely affected by source confusion due to poor spatial resolution .",
    "herschel _ space observatory ( pilbratt et al .  2010 ) has enormously extended the sky coverage at fir / sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the _ herschel _",
    "astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas , eales et al.2010 ) will map 570 square degrees in five bands from 100 to 500@xmath8 m . as pointed out by blain ( 1996 ) , the sub - mm band is well suited for generating large samples of strongly lensed galaxies at high redshift due to the large negative @xmath9-correction and steep source counts . the science demonstration phase ( sdp ) h - atlas observations have confirmed the excess of bright lensed smgs over the expected number counts of unlensed galaxies ( negrello et al .  2010 ) , which is consistent with the results found from the south pole telescope survey ( vieira et al .  2010 ; lima et al .  2010 ) .    deriving redshifts for the lensed smgs is challenging using traditional optical and near - infrared techniques .",
    "the smgs themselves are highly obscured , and the foreground lensing galaxies dominate the emission seen at optical and near - infrared wavelengths . however , we are no longer limited to these traditional techniques .",
    "the new generation of wide - bandwidth spectrometers operating at cm / mm / sub - mm wavelengths now make it possible to determine redshifts directly from the co rotational lines ( e.g. , wei et al .",
    "2009 ; swinbank et al .",
    "in addition to accurate redshift measurements , co observations are fundamental to our understanding of galaxy evolution by measuring the mass of the molecular gas reservoir from which stars form . the first two smgs in which co was detected ( frayer et al.1998 , 1999 ) were relatively bright at optical wavelengths , which enabled timely follow - up co observations .",
    "subsequent co detections of additional smgs took several years .",
    "in general , deep radio or mm / sub - mm wavelength interferometric continuum maps were required to derive accurate counterpart positions ( frayer et al .",
    "2000 ; ivison et al .  2002 ; dannerbauer et al .",
    "2002 ; younger et al .",
    "then , deep spectroscopic observations were necessary to obtain redshifts ( ivison et al .  1998 ; barger et al .  1999 ; frayer et al .",
    "2003 ; chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) . with accurate redshifts ,",
    "co observations were finally possible ( e.g. , neri et al .  2003 ; greve et al .",
    "hence , the process of following - up smgs in co used to be very time consuming . now , using the wide - bandwidth radio spectrometers , we can bypass the intermediate steps and directly search for co lines at the location of the smgs uncovered by _",
    "herschel _ and other sub - mm instruments .",
    "an additional important advantage of direct co searches is that we avoid the biases related to the radio and optical selection of candidate smg counterparts .    in this paper",
    ", we report on co(1 - 0)observations of two lensed smgs ( sdp.81 and sdp.130 ) uncovered by the h - atlas program using the wide - bandwidth zpectrometer instrument on the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "a cosmology of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "the discovery of the lensed smgs sdp.81 ( h - atlas j090311.6 + 003906 ) and sdp.130 ( h - atlas j091305.0@xmath13005343 ) was reported by negrello et al.(2010 ) . both of these sources have spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) that peak in the 350@xmath14 m band , suggesting redshifts of @xmath153 assuming local ulirg seds that peak at 80100@xmath14 m in their rest frame .",
    "given their strong observed - frame 350@xmath14 m emission ( 180mjy and 130mjy for sdp.81 and sdp.130 respectively ) , they were ideal targets for the zpectrometer instrument on the gbt .",
    "the instrument currently covers the 25.6136.09 ghz band corresponding to redshifted co(1 - 0)from @xmath163.50 .",
    "the zpectrometer is an analog lag cross - correlator spectrometer connected to the gbt dual - channel ka - band correlation receiver ( see harris et al .",
    "2010 for additional details ) .",
    "the zpectrometer observations of sdp.81 and sdp.130 were carried out on 2010 march 24 and april 21 ( gbt program 10a-77 ) .",
    "the observations were taken using the sub - reflector beam switching ( `` subbeamnod '' ) mode with a 10 second switching interval .",
    "alternating sets of subbeamnod observations between the two targets were taken every 4 minutes to remove the residual baseline structure . by differencing the resulting spectra of the two targets sdp.81 ( `` on '' position ) and sdp.130 ( `` ref '' position ) flat baselines",
    "were achieved ( fig .",
    "we obtained 2.3 hours of effective integration time ( 1.15 hours of on time and 1.15 hours of ref time ) . during the observing cycle ,",
    "the observations were about 65% efficient . including the additional time for pointing , focus , and calibration , 5.5 hours of telescope time",
    "were used .",
    "spectra of the pointing source 0825 + 0309 were taken every hour to monitor gain variations .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was derived from observations of 3c286 .",
    "we adopt a flux density of 2.04 jy at 32 ghz for 3c286 ( ott et al .",
    "1994 ) . after correcting for atmospheric opacity effects and based on the dispersion of measurements",
    "observed for 0825 + 0309 , we estimate a 15% absolute calibration uncertainty for the data .",
    "we observe strong emission lines in the spectra of both sdp.81 and sdp.130 which we identify as co(1 - 0 ) , yielding redshifts of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . follow - up co(3 - 2)observations made with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) ( r. neri et al .  2010 , in preparation ) and the higher level co transitions observed with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) z - spec instrument ( lupu et al . 2010 )",
    "confirm the co(1 - 0)line identifications with the gbt .",
    "single - component gaussian fits to the lines were made to derive the co(1 - 0)properties ( table  1 ) .",
    "the co(1 - 0)profiles are slightly asymmetric in directions consistent with the pdbi co(3 - 2)profiles , but given the limited co(1 - 0)spectral resolution , the zpectrometer profiles are consistent with a single gaussian .",
    "the instrumental spectral response is nearly a sinc function with a full - width half max ( fwhm ) of 20 mhz . for intrinsic gaussian fwhm line widths larger than 30 mhz ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "the line width correction for the instrumental response is less than 1% .",
    "figure  2 shows the gaussian fits to the raw 8 mhz channels .",
    "the raw channels were binned by three channels to yield statistically independent channels .",
    "we achieved an rms of 0.18 mjy per 24 mhz channel , albeit with significant variation across the full zpectrometer bandwidth .",
    "the observations were taken at fixed frequencies ( topocentric velocity scale ) .",
    "small doppler corrections of @xmath20 were applied to the observed line centers to derive the redshifts with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr , table  1 ) .",
    "the mass of molecular gas ( including he ) is computed using @xmath21 , where the co(1 - 0)line luminosity is in units of @xmath22 ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) . while there is still considerable discussion about the appropriate value for @xmath23 at high - redshift ( e.g. tacconi et al . 2008 ; ivison et al .",
    "2010a ) , we adopt the `` standard '' local ulirg value of @xmath24 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) for direct comparison with previous studies",
    ". however , a higher value may be more appropriate for the expected multi - phase molecular ism in strong starburst systems ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2007 ; harris et al .  2010 ; danielson et al .  2010 ; ivison et al .",
    "observations of co(1 - 0)are key for deriving the total molecular gas mass .",
    "the co(1 - 0)line traces the cold material not probed by the higher - level co transitions .",
    "unfortunately , most high redshift sources to date have been observed in only the higher level @xmath25 transitions ( e.g. , co(3 - 2)or higher ) , and many papers have assumed a single - component ism that is fully thermalized with @xmath26 . however , recent co(1 - 0)observations of the smg population show that this assumption is not correct ( harris et al .  2010 ; carilli et al .  2010 ; swinbank et al .  2010 ; ivison et al .  2010a , b ) . from the compilation of these previous results ,",
    "an average co line ratio value of @xmath27 is found for a sample of nine smgs .",
    "sdp.81 and sdp.130 also have ratios of less than unity .",
    "based on the co(3 - 2)observations made with the pdbi ( r. neri et al.2010 , in preparation ) , sdp.81 and sdp.130 have @xmath28 ratios of 0.5 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "these ratios are in agreement with the previous smg results , as well as the average value of @xmath29 measured for local infrared galaxies ( yao et al .  2003 ; leech et al .",
    "although the values measured for smgs are similar to the average value found for the local starburst population , there are significant variations in the ratio locally ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "the possible wide range of co line ratios highlights the importance of obtaining co(1 - 0)observations for the smgs and other high - redshift populations for comparison .",
    "for example , the bzk galaxies may show similar `` sub - thermal '' co line ratios as the smgs ( dannerbauer et al .",
    "2009 ; aravena et al .",
    "2010 ) , while in contrast high - redshift quasars tend to show co lines ratios of order unity up to co(4 - 3 ) or even higher transitions ( e.g. , riechers et al .",
    "2006 ) .    based on their @xmath31 luminosities corrected for amplification by lensing ( table  1 ) ,",
    "the derived molecular gas masses for sdp.81 and sdp.130 are ( 13)@xmath32 , which is about 35 times larger than that found for local ulirgs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) , but is consistent with other smgs studied to date ( adopting the same @xmath33 ) . since the infrared luminosity is proportional to the star - formation rate and the co luminosity is proportional to the molecular gas mass , the infrared to co luminosity ratio provides an indication of the star - formation efficiency . however , given the uncertainties of converting the observables into physical quantities ( especially the uncertainty of @xmath23 ) , we restrict the discussion to the observed @xmath34 ratios . strong starbursts and ulirgs tend to show high ir - to - co luminosity ratios of @xmath35 , while local spiral galaxies have lower values of about 1050 ( e.g. , solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) . based on their infrared luminosities ( table  1 ) , sdp.81 and sdp.130 have @xmath34 ratios of 120 and 140 @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "greve et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found an average @xmath4 ratio for smgs which was a factor of two larger than that for local ulirgs .",
    "if the published data are corrected for the same cosmology ( sec . 1 ) , infrared luminosity definition [ @xmath37 , 81000@xmath14 m ] , and for the same co(1 - 0)transition , the smgs actually show a slightly lower @xmath7 ratio on average in comparison to local ulirgs .",
    "we recomputed the infrared luminosities for the local ulirg sample given by solomon et al.(1997 ) , using the relationship in sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) , and find a median value of @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) .",
    "the uncertainty represents the standard deviation of the ratio for the sample after throwing out one outlier , divided by the square - root of the number of sources ( 28 ) , and includes an additional 15% systematic calibration uncertainty . adopting @xmath40 , the implied @xmath31 values for smgs",
    "are increased by a factor of 1.67 in comparison to greve et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which assumed @xmath41 . the average @xmath42 value from greve et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also needs to be decreased by roughly a factor of 2 due to the lower observed dust temperatures measured for the smgs ( kovcs et al .",
    "2006 ; magnelli et al .",
    "2010 ) . after making these corrections , the greve et al .",
    "( 2005 ) results suggest an average value of @xmath43 for the smg population .",
    "this value is consistent with those found for sdp.81 and sdp.130 , and suggests that smgs do not have enhanced @xmath7 ratios in comparison to local ulirgs .",
    "we carried out an additional comparison with the local ulirgs , by using only smgs with infrared measurements near the peak of their rest - frame sed ( 60180@xmath14 m ) ( fig .",
    "3 ) . this improves the derivations of @xmath37 that are dependent on the assumed sed template . including sdp.81 and sdp.130 with a sample of published smgs ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we derive a median value of @xmath44 for the smg population . for sources without co(1 - 0)detections , the published data were converted to co(1 - 0)luminosities adopting @xmath45/l^{\\prime}[{{\\rm co(1 - 0 ) } } ] = 0.8\\pm0.1 $ ] , @xmath46/l^{\\prime}[{{\\rm co(1 - 0 ) } } ] = 0.6\\pm0.1 $ ] , and @xmath47/l^{\\prime}[{{\\rm co(1 - 0 ) } } ] = 0.4\\pm0.1 $ ] . the adopted @xmath48 and @xmath49 values are consistent with simple large - velocity gradient excitation analysis based on @xmath50 ( with temperatures of 2050k and molecular gas densities of order 1000@xmath51 ) and are consistent with current observations of local luminous starbursts .",
    "a direct comparison of the @xmath7 ratios with that of local ulirgs is complicated by the possibility of strong mid - infrared emission ( rest frame 25@xmath14 m ) .",
    "the smg templates used to derive @xmath37 do not include possible excess mid - infrared emission , which is present in some local ulirgs .",
    "however , if we neglect the mid - infrared emission for local ulirgs , the median @xmath34 ratio would decrease by only 10% . including this small possible correction for mid - infrared emission , the median @xmath7 value for smgs is @xmath52 times that found for local ulirgs , i.e.",
    ", the median ratio is slightly lower in smgs , but roughly consistent with local ulirgs within uncertainties .",
    "the observed @xmath28 brightness temperature ratios and the @xmath53 luminosity ratios for sdp.81 and sdp.130 are similar to values found for ulirgs and other smgs . since the co(1 - 0)emission traces the cold gas , which is typically more spatially extended than the co(3 - 2)emission ( ivison et al .",
    "2010a ) , differential lensing could impact the interpretation of the results for sdp.81 and sdp.130 .",
    "if differential lensing is important , then the intrinsic @xmath28 ratios for sdp.81 and sdp.130 may be even lower than the values derived here .",
    "the new generation of broad bandwidth spectrometers now enables blind redshift searches for co emission ( see conference proceedings of baker et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the first blind redshift for the zpectrometer instrument was found for smm j2135 - 0102 ( swinbank et al .",
    "sdp.81 and sdp.130 represent additional blind redshifts from the zpectrometer .",
    "the first blind co redshift for the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) z - spec instrument was found for sdp.81 ( lupu et al .",
    "wei et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported the first blind co redshift using the institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ( iram ) 30 m eight mixer receiver ( emir ) instrument , and daddi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and m. krips et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) have successfully used the pdbi to uncover previously unknown redshifts with co lines .",
    "table  2 shows the capabilities of the current and planned instrumentation for co redshift machines .",
    "based on the combination of its large fractional bandwidth ( 34% ) and good sensitivity , the gbt / zpectrometer is currently the most efficient system for searching for co(1 - 0)lines at redshifts @xmath54 .",
    "although not as sensitive as the gbt , the z - spec instrument has a larger fractional bandwidth ( 46% ) and can search all redshifts using a variety of transitions . at the highest frequencies , co searches may be difficult due to subthermal excitation of the high - j co lines , and the atomic lines such as [ ci ] and [ cii ] may be more feasible ( e.g. , wagg et al . 2010 ) .",
    "a primary science driver for the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) is co redshift searches at 3 mm using the redshift search receiver ( rsr , erickson et al .",
    "when the expanded very large array ( evla ) achieves its full 8  ghz of bandwidth , it will be able to search for co(1 - 0)at redshifts @xmath55 with better sensitivity than that of the gbt / zpectrometer ( table 2 ) .",
    "the sub - millimeter galaxies sdp.81 and sdp.130 are two of the first examples of the lensed smg population discovered by the _",
    "herschel _ space observatory ( negrello et al .  2010 ) .",
    "they have co properties similar to those found for other high - redshift smgs and local ulirgs in terms of their co line ratios and their infrared to co luminosity ratios .",
    "in contrast to previous results , we find no evidence for enhanced @xmath4 ratios for the smgs in comparison to local ulirgs .",
    "given their high amplification , the _ herschel _ population of lensed smgs provides ideal targets for studying the ism properties at high redshift , by allowing observations of fainter lines , such as hcn , @xmath56co , and [ ci ] , which would otherwise be too faint . studying multiple molecular species and detailed imaging of several co transitions are required to constrain the different components of the molecular ism at high redshift and their co to h@xmath57 conversion factors .    in the upcoming era of high - resolution imaging with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) and the evla",
    ", large single dishes will still have a major role to play in spectroscopic co surveys .",
    "the gbt , lmt , and eventually the cerro chajnantor atacama telescope ( ccat ) will be able to determine redshifts for significant samples of highly obscured smgs which are not measureable with even the largest optical and near - infrared telescopes .",
    "we acknowledge the staff at green bank who have made these observations possible .",
