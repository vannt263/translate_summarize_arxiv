    "the investigation of the semileptonic decay @xmath0 is relevant for the extraction of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of this exclusive decay mode would offer a method alternative to the inclusive semileptonic @xmath3 decay for the study of the @xmath4 transition .",
    "a precise measurement of this process is one of the main aims of the future @xmath3-factories .    on the theoretical side",
    "this decay process has received large attention in literature ( see for example the review in @xcite ) since it offers an example of heavy - to - light quark transition computable by the presently available theoretical methods .",
    "the present note is devoted to the study of the @xmath5 decay mode in the framework of the constituent - quark - meson ( cqm ) model @xcite . in this model",
    "the transition amplitudes are evaluated by computing diagrams in which heavy and light mesons are attached to quark loops . moreover , the light chiral symmetry restrictions and the heavy quark spin - flavour symmetry dictated by the heavy - quark - effective - theory ( hqet ) are both implemented .",
    "the advantage of such a description is the reduced number of free parameters with respect to an effective lagrangian at the meson level with no dynamical assumptions@xcite .",
    "a short glossary , useful to go through the results reported here , is in order .",
    "we call @xmath6 the field representing the low - lying heavy meson doublet @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8 the heavy field renormalization constant , induced by loop effects and @xmath9 the difference between the @xmath6 meson doublet mass and the mass of the constituent heavy quark .",
    "@xmath9 is an adjustable parameter of the model and we restrict to @xmath10  gev since only this range of values allows for a good phenomenology of semileptonic weak decays ( for a discussion see @xcite ) . for the definition of the model , it is important to fix the regularization procedure allowing to calculate explicitly the quark loop integrals .",
    "we use the schwinger proper time regularization method , assuming , as ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) cut - off , @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 gev respectively .",
    "another parameter is the constituent light quark mass @xmath13 that we have fixed in @xcite to the value : @xmath14  gev for @xmath15 and @xmath16 flavours .",
    "we consider the weak current matrix element for the semileptonic @xmath1 transition which is given by ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19\\ ; f_1(q^2)\\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\left [ \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2-m_b^2}{q^2}q^{\\mu } \\right ] \\ ; f_0(q^2 ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 .",
    "the calculation of the semileptonic process proceeds through the evaluation of the diagrams in fig .",
    "1,2 and 3 . fig .",
    "1 gives rise to a non derivative coupling .",
    "2a and fig .",
    "2b are polar diagrams where the pion is introduced through a derivative interaction term : in fig .",
    "2a the intermediate particle is the vector meson particle belonging to the @xmath6 heavy meson multiplet ; in fig .",
    "2b the intermediate particle is the scalar ( @xmath21 ) meson particle belonging to the positive parity @xmath22 heavy meson multiplet ( this multiplet is built similarly to @xmath6 and contains also an axial vector meson @xmath23 state ) .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "2b represents only a correction to the chiral symmetry limit . to obtain the contribution of fig .  1 , an expansion of the chiral rotated light quark field , @xmath24 , up to the first order in @xmath25 is needed  @xcite . in the case of fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 the same expansion is truncated at the zero - th order . the @xmath24 field , as defined in  @xcite , is given by @xmath26 being @xmath27 the usual spinor field describing the light degrees of freedom and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the diagram in fig .  1 produces a result proportional to the leptonic @xmath3-decay constant ; its predictions are expected to be valid at small pion momenta , near the zero recoil point : @xmath30 .",
    "one obtains , from this non - derivative ( nd ) coupling , the contributions : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath3 leptonic decay constant .",
    "the cqm - model evaluation of @xmath32 is given in @xcite .",
    "neglecting a smooth logarithmic dependence , the heavy meson mass dependence of @xmath32 , as predicted by the hqet , is as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 parametrises the leading term in the decay constant @xmath32 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "next we consider the polar diagrams in fig .",
    "2 . first of all let us consider the diagram in fig .",
    "2(a ) which gives a contribution proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-strong coupling constant .",
    "one obtains the following contribution to @xmath38  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-strong coupling constant evaluated in @xcite ( see also @xcite for an evaluation in the framework of the qcd sum - rule approach and @xcite in the framework of the effective meson lagrangian approach ) . the diagram in fig .",
    "2(b ) contributes to the other form factor : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-strong coupling constant evaluated in @xcite , @xmath43 is the @xmath44 state in the @xmath22 multiplet @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the @xmath43 leptonic decay constant analogous to @xmath47 .",
    "all the coupling constants appearing in these equations can be computed in the cqm .",
    "the polar results ( [ funopol ] ) and ( [ fzeropol ] ) should be reliable near the poles , i.e. again for @xmath48 large , around @xmath49 , the zero recoil point .",
    "we shall discuss below a procedure to extrapolate these results to lower @xmath48 values . for future reference",
    "we quote here the values of the expressions ( [ funopol ] ) and ( [ fzeropol ] ) at @xmath50 : @xmath51 they are obtained with the values @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the results obtained so far are not new ; they have been obtained by several groups and our contribution consists here only in the calculation , within the cqm - model , of the various parameters appearing in the previous equations .",
    "the model however allows to consider a new contribution , depicted in fig .",
    "3 : it differs from the nd ( non - derivative ) term since it is derivative and from the polar term because it does not contain couplings to resonances .",
    "the current directly couples to the quark in this case rather than to the heavy meson as in the polar contribution . both the polar and the new `` direct '' contributions can be reliably calculated only at large @xmath48 , note however that differently from ( 7 ) and ( 8) for the polar terms , the relation @xmath20 will be automatically satisfied by the new contributions to be described in the following .",
    "we compute them by a straightforward application of the basic rules of the cqm .",
    "as the current will transform a heavy meson into a light one in this case , we need the interaction of the pion with light quarks .",
    "we recall here the corresponding lagrangian . the term relevant for the calculation will be the one containing an odd number of pions .",
    "the following term defines the feynman rule we follow to insert the pion in our cqm diagram : @xmath53 apart from the mass term , @xmath54 , is chiral invariant . here",
    "@xmath24 is the chiral rotated light quark field quoted above , @xmath55 and @xmath25 is the @xmath56 matrix representing the flavour @xmath57 octet of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 and : @xmath59 where ( [ vi ] ) generates couplings of an even number of mesons to the @xmath60 pair , while ( [ aa ] ) gives an odd number of @xmath25 fields .    an explicit calculation of the mentioned diagram gives : @xmath61 \\label{primoder}\\\\ f_{0}^{\\rm dir}(q^2)&=&\\frac{2}{f_{\\pi}}\\sqrt{\\frac{z_h}{m_h } } \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{q^2}{m_{\\pi}^2-m_b^2}\\right ) q_\\pi ( c - m a ) \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",
    "m_h \\;b \\left(1+\\frac{q^2}{m_{\\pi}^2-m_b^2}\\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{secondoder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath62 and @xmath63   \\label{zeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the pion 4-momentum ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 .",
    "we observe that the soft pion limit of the previous expression brings @xmath68 defined in @xcite .",
    "notice that in eqs .",
    "( [ primoder],[secondoder ] ) the @xmath48 dependence arises because of @xmath69 and can be computed numerically .",
    "we find : @xmath70 the error in the numerical evaluations is due to the variation of @xmath9 in the range of values @xmath71 .",
    "the contribution of the direct diagram in fig .",
    "3 is an appreciable @xmath72 to @xmath73 correction , depending on the region in @xmath48 .",
    "since the three contributions to the form factors @xmath74 and @xmath38 are independent , we can sum them up , with the result : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and we have marked the form factors with a hat to stress that this formula does not hold in the whole @xmath48 interval . as a matter of fact , as discussed above , the @xmath48 range in which  ( [ ff ] ) is expected to approximate reliably the form factors is around the zero recoil point : @xmath78 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the model allows for a systematic derivative expansion , whose first terms are represented by @xmath79 ; terms of higher order in the pion derivatives , which can be important at small @xmath48 , are suppressed for large @xmath48 .",
    "this observation gives us a hint to extrapolate to smaller values of @xmath48 . writing : @xmath80 where @xmath81 ; this parameterisation has to satisfy @xmath82 as @xmath83 is the region where @xmath79 are a good approximation of the form factors .",
    "another condition that has to be satisfied is the constraint : @xmath84 which follows from @xmath85 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the corrections to @xmath86 arise from terms with extra pion derivatives .",
    "therefore we put @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the pion energy in the @xmath3 rest frame , @xmath89 gev and @xmath90 are free parameters . since ( [ gj ] ) is equivalent to ( under the assumption that @xmath91 ) : @xmath92 condition ( [ uno ] ) is automatically satisfied . formula ( [ due ] )",
    "implies that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are related : @xmath95 we could fix one of the two parameters from experimental data , were they available . for the time being , in absence of such information , we have to use some theoretical input .",
    "there exist many theoretical calculations of the @xmath96 couplings ; for example quark models @xcite predict @xmath97 to @xmath98 with the exception of @xcite which gives a very small value @xmath99 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory together with heavy quark effective theory gives @xmath100 @xcite , qcd sum - rules give @xmath101 to @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "finally lattice results are @xmath103 to @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "we take as an input the result of the qcd sum rules calculation of @xcite that gives @xmath105 , in this way we obtain @xmath106 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rather large value of @xmath93 obtained by this procedure indicates that the effective parameter of the derivative expansion is not of the order of 1 gev ( @xmath107 ) , but larger , which means that , in spite of the fact that this approximation should hold only at zero recoil point , it gives reasonable estimates also at lower @xmath48 .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by our estimate of the first correction to the leading terms of the form factors , i.e. @xmath108 , which is appreciable , but not very large ( @xmath72 to @xmath73 of the total ) .",
    "letting the parameter @xmath93 vary by @xmath109 allows to see how the parameterisation affects the result . in the table the two form factors @xmath38 and @xmath74 , including the cqm correction , are given for few @xmath48 values near the maximum value @xmath110 gev@xmath111 .",
    "the error refer a variation of the values of @xmath93 in the range @xmath112@xmath113 .",
    "we have also reported results from other theoretical approaches .",
    "let us note , as a concluding remark , that our calculation includes , differently from other approaches based on the derivative expansion , some deviations from the leading behaviour expected in the soft pion limit .",
    "these extra terms , while sizeable , are not such to change qualitatively the simple pole behaviour predicted by the chiral effective theory .",
