    "4b suggests that the under - doped _ n_-doped cuprates are in the strong coupling regime .",
    "therefore , in under - doped samples the two qps excited out of the sc condensate by raman processes continue to interact , binding into a collective excitonic state that costs less energy than excitation of two independent qps .",

    "when ce doping is increased to @xmath76 , arpes data shows that the electron pocket persists and the excitations around hole - like fs acquires more coherent spectral weight.@xcite well - defined sc coherence peaks appear in both @xmath7 and @xmath43 channels with the peak energy about twenty percent higher in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "one can infer that for optimal doping the superconductivity exists in both hole and electron bands but the gap is larger in the hole channel . for over - doped samples , it is likely that the fs is hole - like and centered at ( @xmath17 , @xmath17 ) points .",
    "the evolutionary trend of the fs with doping in the arpes data supports this view though arpes data on over - doped samples is still lacking .",
    "the situation may be more complicated because there is evidence from hall effect data that both hole - like and electron - like carriers exist even for over - doped samples with @xmath77.@xcite nevertheless , hole - like carriers dominate the low temperature hall effect data for dopings @xmath78 .",

    "certain aspects of the observations in the preceding paragraph need further comment . for conventional superconductors that are fermi liquids above @xmath14 , theory does not predict a partial sum - rule for low energy raman scattering connecting the normal and sc states akin to the ferrell - glover - tinkham sum - rule in optics .",
    "however , we have experimentally demonstrated the existence of a partial raman sum - rule at low energies in the normal and sc states for the @xmath20-doped cuprates .",
    "the question of whether this partial sum - rule is limited to the @xmath20-doped cuprates or is more generic encompassing @xmath74-doped cuprates as well can be decided by a similar analysis of the raman data that exists for several families of @xmath74-doped cuprates .",

    "we note that the @xmath125 value of optimally doped films from magneto - resistivity , using the full recovery of resistivity criterion,@xcite is consistent with that obtained from raman and thermodynamic measurements .",
    "however , for the over - doped film ( x @xmath73 0.17 ) , @xmath125 ( at 5 k ) based on the appearance of resistance@xcite is consistent with @xmath111 from the raman data on similarly doped crystals .",
    "this could mean that vortex flow physics , which plays a dominant role in cuprate superconductors with short coherence lengths , becomes less important in the over - doped @xmath20-type cuprates with longer coherence lengths.@xcite    in fig .",
    "7c we show that the values for @xmath119 are related to the sc gap .",
    "we compare here @xmath127 to the bcs coherence length @xmath128 , where the fermi velocity @xmath129  m / s is estimated from arpes measurements@xcite and the lowest temperature sc gap values @xmath130 are used from raman and tunneling data.@xcite",
    "the comparison plot reveals that the @xmath131 trend resembles the doping dependence of @xmath127 and therefore confirms the relation of @xmath119 to the pairing potential @xmath130 .",
    "it also indicates that @xmath127 is still about two times lower and @xmath119 is about four times higher than expected for a conventional bcs superconductor with corresponding isotropic gap .",
    "@xmath132 for the @xmath20-doped cuprates is significantly larger than for their @xmath74-doped counterparts and that leads to important differences .",
    "first , the size of the cooper pair is larger than the average inter - particle spacing : @xmath133 ranges between 40 and 150 , still smaller than for conventional bcs superconductors but an order of magnitude larger than for the @xmath74-doped cuprates .",
    "second , a larger cooper pair size requires further pair interactions to be taken into account and leads to a more complicated non - monotonic momentum dependence of the sc gap rather than the simplest @xmath134 @xmath21-wave form that well describes the gap function for @xmath74-doped cuprates with very tight cooper pairs.@xcite",
    "the superconducting ( sc ) phase diagram of the electron - doped cuprates has been explored by raman spectroscopy .",
    "the sc gap magnitudes in optimally- and over - doped samples are in agreement with the single particle spectroscopy measurements",
    ". the coupling decreases with increasing ce concentrations from the strong - coupling regime for the under - doped sample to a weak - coupling at optimal doping and beyond . for the under - doped film ,",
    "a collective mode in the raman data in the sc state implies strong final state interactions .",
    "this collective mode appears in the @xmath7 channel in contrast to the _ p_-doped cuprates where it appears in the @xmath43 channel . at this stage",
    "we can only stress the importance of this observation that has the potential of giving us an insight into the pairing mechanism in the sc state  @xcite .",
    "the full ramifications of this observation deserve further contemplation and are deferred to a later publication .",
    "the persistence of sc coherence peaks in the @xmath7 channel for all dopings implies that superconductivity is mainly governed by interactions in the vicinity of ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) regions of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "moreover , the appearance of sc coherence as a collective mode in the @xmath7 channel in the under - doped sample ( @xmath135 ) coincides with the appearance of hole - like carriers near ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) regions of the bz as seen by arpes in under - doped ncco.@xcite for the sample with ce doping @xmath135 , our @xmath7 raman data shows that sc pairing first occurs primarily near the ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) regions of the bz where hole - like carriers reside while the more numerous electron - like carriers show no comparable sign of sc pairing in the @xmath43 channel .",
    "the presence of hole - like carriers near ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) regions of the bz appears to be vital for superconductivity in the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "well - defined sc coherence peaks in the @xmath43 channel occur for optimally - doped samples and this implies that the electron - like carriers near the ( @xmath17 , @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath16 , @xmath136 ) regions of the bz are also gapped at this doping . whether the pairing of electron - like carriers is driven by pairing of hole - like carriers or",
    "occurs independently is an important question that requires further investigation .",
    "low energy scattering below the sc coherence peak energies for all dopings and raman symmetries is most likely due to nodal qps and means that the sc gap has nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "this is consistent with phase sensitive measurements that find the sc pairing symmetry to be predominantly @xmath137.@xcite however , the order parameter is likely to be more complicated than monotonic @xmath137 @xcite given the occurrence of two - band superconductivity and long sc coherence lengths .",
    "we have also carried out a systematic spectroscopic study of magnetic field and temperature dependence of the electron - doped cuprates in the sc state .",
    "we have plotted the field and temperature dependence of the sc gap magnitude and the integrated intensity of the reduced 2@xmath72 coherence peaks for various electron concentrations . from the temperature and doping dependence of the sc coherence peak ,",
    "we extract an effective upper critical field line @xmath11 at which the superfluid stiffness vanishes .",
    "the field dependence of the measured sc gap reveals an estimate of @xmath12 , an upper critical field at which the sc amplitude is completely suppressed by field . for optimally - doped samples ,",
    "the field effectively suppresses the superfluid stiffness while the sc amplitude survives higher fields suggesting a phase fluctuation regime for these samples .",
    "we find that magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath27-axis linearly suppresses the sc gap magnitude at a rapid rate , a phenomenon different from observations in other type ii superconductors in the clean limit.@xcite this implies a novel pair - breaking mechanism for @xmath20-doped cuprates in a magnetic field .",
    "we find that the sc coherence length , @xmath138 , increases from 60    for optimal doping to 220    for the over - doped sample with @xmath139  k. there appears to be a doping - dependent crossover in physical properties associated with superconductivity : relatively robust sc pairing at optimal doping becomes tenuous in the over - doped regime where field suppresses the pairing potential at an anomalously large rate while @xmath14 still remains relatively high .",
    "we also find that carriers doped beyond optimal doping remain mainly incoherent and do not contribute to the drude conductivity and superfluid density .",
    "this possibly explains the fragility of superconductivity in the over - doped regime of the electron - doped cuprates .",

    "the measured raman response in the sc state at lowest temperature is depicted by blue curves ( at the lowest frequency , below 6 @xmath71 , the data is linearly extrapolated to @xmath141 @xmath51 0 limit ) .",
    "the yellow and green curves in the upper two panels are the mfl continua based on two assumptions respectively : ( i ) that the continuum vanishes just below 2@xmath72 , and ( ii ) that it falls off at @xmath59 in the same way as it was derived from the fit to the data just above @xmath14 . in the case of the optimally - doped crystal , the scattering in the sc state falls off more rapidly at low frequencies than the continuum based on assumption ( ii ) , and therefore the continuum is truncated at 30 @xmath71 .",
