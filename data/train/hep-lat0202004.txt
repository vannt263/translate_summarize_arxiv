    "recent experimental progress in flavor physics to look for the effect of new physics strongly requires precise theoretical predictions from the standard model . however , model independent calculation of hadronic matrix elements is difficult because of nonperturbative nature of qcd .",
    "the lattice qcd simulation is one of most promising approaches in which the systematic uncertainties can be reduced systematically @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to construct a framework for lattice calculations of hadronic matrix elements in a few percent systematic accuracy , as required by the experiments in progress .    in a lattice calculation of heavy quarks such as the charm and bottom ,",
    "one need to either avoid or control the large discretization error of @xmath1 .",
    "although the effective theoretical approaches @xcite successfully describe the matrix elements with heavy quarks within 10% accuracy , further improvement of accuracy is difficult due to perturbative error .",
    "the nonperturbative renormalization method @xcite are not directly applicable to a determination of the coefficient of @xmath0 improving term in the region of @xmath2 because of a strong mass dependence .",
    "therefore a new framework is desired for which a systematic nonperturbative improvement can be performed .",
    "the anisotropic lattice , on which the temporal lattice spacing @xmath3 is finer than the spatial one @xmath4 , is a candidate of such a framework .",
    "a high temporal lattice cutoff may enable a relativistic treatment of heavy quark while keeping computational requirement tractable .",
    "the @xmath0 improvement coefficients determined in the light quark region in good precision may directly be available for a heavy quark with @xmath5 .",
    "whether these observations practically hold should be examined numerically , as well as in the perturbation theory .    in this study",
    ", we examine the applicability of anisotropic lattice approach numerically by computing the charmed meson masses and decay constants . although presently achieved accuracy is far from our goal , the result is encouraging for further development in this direction .",
    "this paper shows our preliminary result without technical details and evaluation of the systematic uncertainties , which are fully discussed in other publications @xcite .",
    "the quark action we adopt has the following structure in the hopping parameter form @xcite : @xmath6   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.8 cm }      -   \\kappa_{\\sigma } { \\textstyle \\sum_{i } }           \\left [ ( r\\!-\\!\\gamma_i ) u_i(x ) \\delta_{x+\\hat{i},y }      ( r\\!+\\!\\gamma_i)u_i^{\\dag}(x\\!-\\!\\hat{i})\\delta_{x-\\hat{i},y } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.0 cm }      -   \\kappa_{\\sigma } c_e               { \\textstyle \\sum_{i } } \\sigma_{4i}f_{4i}(x)\\delta_{x , y }   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.0 cm }   \\left .",

    "@xmath9 is the spatial wilson parameter , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coefficients of clover terms which remove @xmath0 errors . although the explicit lorentz symmetry is removed due to the anisotropy , in principle it can be restored for physical observables up to errors of @xmath12 by proper tuning of @xmath13 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for a given @xmath7 .",
    "the action is constructed in accord with the fermilab approach @xcite and hence applicable to an arbitrary quark mass . however , a mass dependent tuning of parameters is difficult beyond perturbation theory .",
    "this may be circumvented by taking @xmath14 , with which the mass dependence of parameters are expected to be small , and it suffices with those values in the chiral limit .    in present study",
    ", we vary only two parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 with fixed other parameters .",
    "we set the wilson parameter as @xmath17 and the clover coefficients as the tadpole - improved tree - level values , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the tadpole improvement @xcite is achieved by rescaling the link variable as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with the mean - field values of the spatial and temporal link variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . instead of @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ", we introduce @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 the former plays the same role as on the isotropic lattice , and the latter corresponds to the bare anisotropy .    on an anisotropic lattice , one must tune the parameters so that the anisotropy of quark field , @xmath27 , equals that of the gauge field , @xmath28 : @xmath29 although @xmath28 and @xmath27 are in general functions of both of gauge parameters ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and quark parameters ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , on a quenched lattice one can determine @xmath32 independently of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and then tune @xmath25 so that a certain observable satisfies the condition ( [ eq : xi ] ) . in this work ,",
    "we define @xmath27 through the relativistic dispersion relation of meson , @xmath33 , \\label{eq : dr1}\\ ] ] for calibration . in the above expression , the energy and mass @xmath34 and @xmath35 are in temporal lattice units while the momentum @xmath36 is in spatial lattice units",
    ". @xmath27 converts the momentum into that in temporal lattice units .",
    "numerical simulations are performed on two quenched lattices of sizes @xmath37 and @xmath38 with the wilson plaquette action at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the values of bare anisotropy are chosen according to a numerical result performed in one percent accuracy in @xcite .",
    "the lattice scales are set by @xmath42 meson mass , and result in @xmath43 gev and @xmath44 gev for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "these values deviate to about 10% from scales determined with other physical quantity , say hadronic radius @xmath45 , and represent the effect in neglecting dynamical quarks .",
    "the mean field values @xmath46 and @xmath47 are obtained in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "the calibration was done in the quark mass region below around charm quark mass in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the quark mass dependence of bare anisotropy @xmath48 , with which @xmath49 holds , is actually small , and @xmath48 is well fitted to a linear form in @xmath50 , @xmath51 the fit results in the values ( @xmath52 ) = ( 0.2490(8 ) , 0.189(15 ) , 0.12592(8 ) ) at @xmath39 , and ( 0.2479(9 ) , 0.143(14 ) , 0.12558(9 ) ) at @xmath53 .",
    "these values are determined in 1% statistical accuracy , while in the chiral limit additional 1% error exists due to the form of extrapolation .",
    "it was also shown that the systematic discretization errors decrease toward the continuum limit .",
    "the light hadron spectra with the obtained parameters are consistent with previous works on isotropic lattices .        for heavy quark",
    ", we use four values of @xmath24 covering the physical charm quark mass with @xmath25 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit_calib ] ) . as the light quark",
    ", we use three values of @xmath24 with @xmath25 at the massless limit , which correspond to the lightest three values used in @xcite for light hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the meson correlator is calculated with the local meson operator . for the decay",
    "constant , we focus on the pseudoscalar mesons . while one needs the matching constants to convert the lattice result into the continuum theory",
    ", we only perform the tadpole - improved tree - level matching in this paper .",
    "we first extrapolate the result to the chiral limit , linearly in light pseudoscalar meson mass squared .",
    "the physical ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 quark masses are defined with the massless limit and the @xmath57 meson mass .",
    "then they are fitted to the quadratic form in @xmath58 , @xmath59 the ps heavy - light meson mass , and interpolated to the physical @xmath60 meson mass . the decay constant of heavy - light meson is extrapolated and interpolated in the form of @xmath61 .",
    "the result after chiral extrapolation is shown in figure  [ fig : decayconst ] .",
    "the gross feature of @xmath59 dependence is consistent with previous works @xcite .",
    "the masses and decay constants for physical quark masses are listed in table  [ tab : decayconst_latt ] .",
    "the hyperfine splittings are consistent with previous works , while 35% less than the experimental values . on the other hand ,",
    "the splitting @xmath62 is close to the experimental value .",
    "the @xmath30 dependence of decay constants are rather large , and considered as of the discretization error and renormalization effect , as well as the uncertainty in setting the scale on quenched lattice .",
    "taking ratios of decay constants , @xmath30 dependence is largely cancelled .",
    "the result is consistent with the previous lattice works @xcite . for more quantitative discussion , we need to discuss more carefully on the systematic uncertainties due to the anisotropy , and to include the matching of current with continuum theory . as our conclusion , the result of numerical simulation is encouraging to pursuit more quantitative analysis in this direction .          a.  x.  el - khadra , a.  s.  kronfeld and p.b .",
