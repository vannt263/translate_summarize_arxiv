    "nonlinear effects become more pronounced in the vicinity of a phase transition , and the magnetisation ( m ) measured in the presence of an exciting field ( h ) can be written as @xmath6 + where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath4 are the first , second and third order susceptibilities respectively .",
    "the higher order susceptibilities contain a wealth of information , but owing to the fact that they are usually a couple of orders smaller in magnitude than the first order susceptibility , are correspondingly more difficult to measure.the second order susceptibility ( @xmath8 ) arises due to the presence of a symmetry breaking field and is observed only in the presence of a dc field , or in materials with a large permanent magnetisation .",
    "though relatively unexplored , @xmath8 has been used to show the coexistence of spin glass phase and ferromagnetic order in a reentrant spin glass system@xcite .",
    "+ the third order susceptibility ( @xmath4 ) has been commonly employed to characterise the spin glass transition , where a negative cusp in @xmath4 was used to identify the onset of a spin glass transition and was used as a direct probe of the divergence of the edward - anderson order parameter@xcite .",
    "@xmath4 has also been used to distinguish a spin glass from a superparamagnet@xcite . among long range order systems , though @xmath4 deduced from dc magnetisation measurements has been used for studying the effect of quadrupolar interactions in rare earth compounds@xcite , it is interesting to note that nonlinear susceptibility measurements on ferromagnetic@xcite and antiferromagnetic@xcite materials are not common , and very few reports exist in literature . moreover , most of the previous experimental works on nonlinear susceptibility in long range order systems are predominantly qualitative and not quantitative in nature . as far as the study of phase transitions",
    "is concerned , though the second order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition has been extensively studied using linear susceptibility@xcite ; the behavior of @xmath4 across the transition has been relatively less explored . + to bring out the advantages as well as the limitations of nonlinear susceptibility measurements in the investigation of a para - ferromagnetic phase transition , we present a comprehensive study on a set of fe - co - ni - cr - b - si amorphous alloys .",
    "these set of alloys are chosen because they were well studied in the past , and it was found through linear ac susceptibility and high field dc magnetisation measurements that they are reasonably well behaved 3-d heisenberg ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "as such , amorphous ferromagnets have been extensively studied using linear susceptibility to understand the influence of quenched disorder on the critical behaviour of spin systems . the effect of disorder as seen in the values of the critical exponents and the width of the assymptotic critical regime have been studied and reviewed extensively@xcite .",
    "nonlinear susceptibility as measured in an amorphous ferromagnet has been reported before@xcite , but to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study on atleast this class of materials , where linear and nonlinear susceptibility alone is used for a complete characterisation of the critical regime .",
    "+ at the outset , we present a simple molecular field treatment to show that @xmath4 diverges on both sides of the transition , and changes sign at the transition temperature .",
    "thus the criticality is observed experimentally , and the related asymptotic critical exponents are calculated .",
    "it has been shown that using the relevant scaling equations , all the necessary exponents , required for a complete characterization of the phase transition can be determined using linear and nonlinear susceptibility measurements alone .",
    "this can be considered as a major advantage of measurement of nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "also , owing to the functional form of @xmath4 across the phase transition , the determination of the true ( zero field ) transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) can be made to a better accuracy .",
    "it is shown that subtle features not discernable using normal linear susceptibility measurements , can be picked up using nonlinear susceptibility , making it a very useful tool for studies of spin systems in the critical region . hence ,",
    "in this paper , we show the following advantages of @xmath4 : + ( i ) determination of all the relevant critical exponents + ( ii ) accurate determination of @xmath3 + ( iii)detecting subtle features not seen in linear susceptibility measurements . + it is important to note that though the present study deals with amorphous ferromagnets , criticality in @xmath4 can be used equally effectively in the study of phase transitions in their crystalline counterparts .",
    "a well characterised and extensively studied series of amorphous ferromagnets ( @xmath9 ) with x = 5 , 10 , 15 referred to as a2 , a3 and a4 have been used in this study .",
    "these samples prepared by melt quenching are in the form of ribbons of approximate dimensions ( 10 mm x 1 mm x 0.03mm).@xcite in one of the earlier works@xcite , @xmath4 was determined by fitting the measured isothermal magnetisation using the equation 1 , or alternatively by plotting m / h vs @xmath10 , and calculating the slope in the linear low field range .",
    "another technique involves using the arrots plots , @xmath11 vs @xmath12 , where the slope in the low field range can be related to @xmath4 , through the relation @xmath13 . however , these methods are unsuitable for studying the critical behaviour across the ferromagnetic transition primary due to two reasons ; ( i ) the measuring fields are relatively higher , and this can at times mask the true critical behaviour of the system ( ii)@xmath4 is determined after fitting the dc magnetisation data .",
    "this method is not only time consuming , but also introduces significant errors in the value of @xmath4 . in the present study the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities are measured by monitoring the change in the induced voltage across two oppositely wound secondary coils in a home made susceptometer@xcite .",
    "both the linear and nonlinear susceptibility was determined by using a lock - in - amplifier to measure the signal seen at @xmath14 and 3 @xmath14 respectively , where @xmath14 is the exciting frequency . neglecting the higher order terms ,",
    "the voltage measured at @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where h is the magnitude of the applied field .",
    "it is normal practice to bundle a few ribbons together to increase the measured signal , but in this case , a solitary ribbon was stuck on to a sapphire single crystal , which made up the sample holder , with the temperature sensor and a non magnetic heater on the same crystal .",
    "this was done to avoid temperature gradients across the samples .",
    "a calibrated platinum resistance thermometer ( prt ) was used for measuring the temperature and control to an accuracy of 0.01k was achieved using a lakeshore temperature controller drc-93a .",
    "exciting fields from about 100 moe to a few oe and frequencies ranging from 73 hz to 1.33khz were used for different experimental runs .",
    "all the measurements were performed with the applied field parallel to the long edges of the samples to minimise the effect of the demagnetisation fields .",
    "ac susceptibility is amongst the finest tools for the study of critical phenomenon , not only due to the relative ease with which measurements can be done but also due to the fact that very low field measurements can be performed .",
    "the most important advantage is that it directly gives the true initial susceptibility ( @xmath17 ) , which otherwise has to be calculated from data taken at comparatively higher measuring fields .",
    "considering that fact that the ideal second order paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition is defined in zero external field , ac susceptibility becomes a very good tool for studying criticality , as larger exciting fields used during the course of measurements are likely to mask the true critical behaviour of the system under study . also , the kouvel fisher [ k - f ] analysis@xcite of the ac susceptibility data is a good means of accurately determining both the transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) as well as the susceptibility exponent ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "figures 1a , 1b and 1c show the kouvel fisher plots ( @xmath19 ) vs t ) for the three samples .",
    "the inverse of the slopes directly gives us the value of the susceptibility exponent @xmath20 and the intercepts of the straight line provides us with an independent estimate of the transition temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this series has been well studied in the past@xcite , and the values of @xmath3 and @xmath20 reported are in reasonable agreement with the values we have obtained , as is shown in table 1 .",
    ".[tab : table 1]values of the susceptibility exponent ( @xmath20 ) and the transition temperature @xmath3 as determined from the kouvel - fischer analysis of the first order susceptibility .",
    "the values determined by the earlier workers is given for the sake of comparison . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as is clearly seen our values match reasonably with that given in ref.@xcite the only exponent in which a large difference is seen is @xmath21 which is calculated by using the rushbrooke equality , ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the ambiguity in the value of this exponent is probably because the values determined in ref@xcite is calculated by using both high dc field and low ac field measurements , as is the general practice , whereas in our case @xmath21 is determined by using low field linear and nonlinear ac susceptibility measurements alone .",
    "accurate determination of @xmath3 has always been an important consideration in the study of criticality across the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "the most popular techniques used till date have been the k - f formalism ( discussed in the earlier section ) and the arrots plots@xcite.arrots plots works on the principle of plotting the isothermal experimental data as @xmath11 vs @xmath12 at different temperatures in the transition region .",
    "they should be straight lines in the critical region with the intercepts of these lines with the ( @xmath12 ) axis being positive if @xmath23 , and negative when @xmath24 .",
    "however , it is important to note that this is valid only when the domain allignment is complete , ie the low field experimental data is completely excluded .",
    "this can at times be a non trivial problem , specially in systems with large field induced effects , causing uncertainties in the accurate determination of @xmath3 .",
    "also , in inhomogeneous systems , ( like amorphous ferromagnets ) , the arrots plots , tend to be curved , even at large measuring fields , thus making the identification of @xmath3 even more difficult@xcite.as has been described earlier , @xmath4 diverges on both sides of the transition temperature , and changes sign exactly at @xmath3 . moreover ,",
    "this critical behaviour is extremely sensitive to the magnitude of the field in which the measurement is done , and this critical feature is seen to vanish with increasing field .",
    "this makes @xmath4 a very promising candidate for an accurate determination of @xmath3 , as even by theory , the ferromagnetic transition is defined for the limit @xmath25 , and any large measurement field is likely to change the thermodynamic properties of the system under study .",
    "plotting the temperature of crossover ( @xmath3 ) vs the field used during the measurement ( @xmath26 ) , it is clearly seen that the @xmath3 varies linearly with the applied field .",
    "thus , extrapolating this to @xmath27 , one will be able to determine @xmath3 to a very high accuracy .",
    "this is shown in figure 5 , where @xmath3 vs h is plotted for the sample a3 .",
    "the intercept at @xmath27 , gives us the value of @xmath28k .",
    "a simple molecular treatment of the second order para - ferromagnetic phase transition shows that @xmath4 diverges on both sides of the transition , and changes over sign at @xmath3 .",
    "this criticality has been experimentally observed in a well studied series of amorphous alloys , and the related assymptotic critical exponents have been determined .",
    "it is shown that sensitive nonlinear susceptibility measurements , along with linear susceptibility , can be used to fully characterize the phase transition , without the need for any other type of measurements , like dc magnetisation , specific heat , etc . moreover , due to the functional form of @xmath4 at the transition , the transition temperature @xmath3 can be determined accurately . using the field dependence of @xmath4 , an extrapolation to true zero field",
    "can be made , which gives us a unique way of determining the transition temperature .",
    "subtle features not seen in the first order susceptibility , like the presence of magnetic clusters with a distribution of @xmath3 s is observed .",
    "this only goes on to show that at times nonlinear susceptibility can be a more sensitive tool than their linear counterparts in understanding the magnetism of spin systems in the critical region .",
