    "structure of online social networks emerges via self - organizing processes of social dynamics , where the links are being established and used for communications between individuals .",
    "the contents ( information , emotion ) communicated between pairs and groups of participants affects their activity patterns and thus shape the network s evolution .",
    "two prototypal classes of online social networks can be distinguished @xcite : a hierarchically organized multi - layered structure that reflects the level of knowledge of the involved individuals in the chats - based systems , on one hand , and a wider class of networks with community structure , on the other . recently , online social networks of both types have been studied based on high - resolution empirical data from a variety of web portals @xcite .    in social sciences , the _ value of social networking _ can be quantified .",
    "specifically , the _ social capital _ , as an essential element of functioning social networks , measures how social relationships create a competitive advantage of certain individuals at the expense of others @xcite .",
    "for instance , the simmelian ties and the related brokerage roles measure how an individual can act as a broker ( transmitting actor ) in a dense social community @xcite .",
    "the availability of massive empirical data of online social interactions and their dynamics that completes the information for the study of social graphs offers the possibility to investigate the mechanisms of social capital build - up by different actors . in view of ever - evolving social graphs ,",
    "intricate communication processes result in the social - value relationships within communities where the social layers may play a role .",
    "analysis of such social structures on multilayered networks requires new mathematical approach , capable of taking into account the inner ( in depth ) structure of each society and the role of different nodes in it .    in recent research",
    ", efforts have been made on determining the network complexity metric that permits to successfully distinguish between critical and redundant nodes @xcite , discover the active cores of the network as compared to the network s periphery @xcite and quantify the network s multiplexity@xcite and the role of higher - order structures in the network dynamics @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "several approaches have focused on introducing suitable graph - theoretic vectors that can be defined on local graphlets @xcite , the network s feature vector @xcite or the graph s eigenvalue spectrum @xcite .",
    "these approaches proved very useful in the study of biological systems , for example , in alignment of protein networks @xcite and uncovering network function in cancer - related processes @xcite . similarly , characterizing topology of molecular graphs @xcite as well as determining modules in socio - technological networks by eigenvectors localization @xcite have been successful .    in this work",
    ", we exploit the topological concept of a _ simplex _ , structure that extends beyond the nodes and links , i.e. , a polyhedron of possibly high dimension , and their aggregates or _",
    "simplicial complexes_. we investigate in - depth topology of online social networks and explore the role of nodes in layers and communities .",
    "the concept of simplicial complexes of graphs @xcite allows precise definition , using topological , algebraic and combinatorial tools , of the node s natural surroundings in the network .",
    "consequently , it allows to determine the node s social capital such as the simmelian brokerage in social environments .",
    "the considered network in this paper is constructed from the original data collected from ` myspace ` social network as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . typically , in online social networks , such as ` myspace ` and ` facebook ` , certain kind of social graphs exist a priori .",
    "however , the use of connections over time as well as the dominance of positive emotions in the texts of messages @xcite reveal the dynamical structure that is different from the conventional social networks .",
    "in general , network layers appear due to different types of relationships among nodes @xcite . in ` myspace ` and ` facebook ` social networks , where text messages of mixed information contents are communicated , the emotion contained in these words can be inferred @xcite .",
    "this fact offers the possibility to identify the network s layered structure in a unique manner .",
    "specifically , one can define layers that propagate emotions with positive or negative valence ( attractiveness and aversiveness ) .",
    "quantitative study of emotions , based on russell s model @xcite , and the social dimension of emotional interactions are the subject of an intensive research in recent years ( see the summary of the cyberemotions project @xcite ) . in this context , the dynamics of emotion spreading on networks has been investigated by an agent - based model @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ this model to generate network layers .",
    "the agents are interacting along the social links of ` myspace ` network influencing each - other s emotional state by exchanging messages .",
    "the identity of each message in the simulations is known , its time of inception , source and recipient nodes as well as its emotional content that matches the current emotional state of the agent who created it .",
    "consequently , the links carrying negative / positive emotion messages can be distinguished ; together with the involved nodes these links define the corresponding network layer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the standard structure of the network , as well as the dynamics leading to the emotion - propagating layers , is briefly described in section  [ sec - network ] .",
    "the basic definitions and the method are described in [ sec - simplices ] .",
    "the analysis of simplices and their complexes in the communities , section  [ sec - topology ] , and in the emotion - propagation layers of the network , section  [ sec - layers ] , is presented .",
    "section  [ sec - brokerage ] deals with the functional relationship between simmelian brokerage role of a node and its topological dimension .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusions ] contains a brief summary of the results and conclusions .",
    "in this work we use the online social network from the empirical data of ref .",
    "@xcite , consisting of the links in ` myspace ` along which the messages were exchanged within 2-months time window .",
    "the original data and the network mapping are described in @xcite together with the study of the dynamics of emotions detected in the data .",
    "the structure of these networks has been defined in terms of several measures . in particular , the degree- and strength- distributions , link correlations ",
    "disassortativity , reciprocity , path lengths , clustering , community structure , and testing the weak - tie hypothesis have been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the purpose of this work , this study will be termed _",
    "standard analysis of a social graph_. these results revealed that the ` myspace ` dialogs graph exhibits the characteristic social community structure .",
    "a similar conclusion was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite considering the static structure of the ` facebook ` graph .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite uncovers that several other topology measures , notably , disassortativity , non - reciprocal in- and out - linking , the role of weak - ties , are different from the features often found in social networks .",
    "moreover , they share a high similarity with the networks of online games studied recently in @xcite .",
    "together with some other findings @xcite , the observations in @xcite suggest that the dynamical organization of online social networks can be strikingly different from that of the conventional social graphs .",
    "the origin of such structure can be traced in the dynamics of exchanged messages with their emotional contents @xcite .",
    "hence , the patterns of conduct and the role of individuals in these processes @xcite are crucial for the emergence of macro - social temporal structures .",
    "therefore , an in - depth topology beyond the standard analysis of the emergent social networks can reveal some of the working mechanisms at the local level . in the remaining parts of this work , we extend the analysis of these networks by means of simplicial complexes . for this purpose , the original network which consists of 32000 nodes is reduced to 3321 nodes by removing nodes with a low connectivity @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of emotional messages is simulated using the agent - based model represented in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard graph theoretical approach which reveals connectivities , a topological framework @xcite provides information about the structure and patterns of connectivities and enables the multifaceted approach including topological , algebraic and combinatorial techniques .",
    "a basic element of the topological approach is a simplex whose spatial representation is a polyhedron .",
    "the polyhedra of various dimensions ( i.e. the number of vertices and faces ) may be connected to each other forming a polyhedral complex , the spatial embodiment of a simplicial complex . in a more formal approach ,",
    "any subset of a set of vertices @xmath2 @xmath3 determines an @xmath4-@xmath5 denoted by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dimension of the simplex .",
    "a @xmath8-simplex @xmath9 is a @xmath8-face of an @xmath7-simplex @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath11 , if every vertex of @xmath12 is also a vertex of @xmath13 the union of faces of a simplex @xmath10 is a boundary of @xmath13 a simplicial complex represents a collection of simplices and its dimension is the largest dimension of its simplices .",
    "more formally , a simplicial complex @xmath14 on a finite set @xmath15 of vertices is a nonempty subset of the power set of @xmath16 , so that the simplicial complex @xmath14 is closed under the formation of subsets .",
    "hence , if @xmath17 and @xmath18.@xmath19 @xmath20 then @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath21 an example of a simplex of dimension zero is a point .",
    "a simplex of dimension one is a line ; two - dimensional simplex is a triangle , three - dimensional simplex is tetrahedron and so on .",
    "simplicial complexes may be constructed directly from the available data or they may be formed from the undirected or directed graphs ( digraphs ) in several different ways .",
    "here we only consider two of them : the neighborhood complex @xcite and the clique complex @xcite .",
    "the neighborhood complex _ _ n__@xmath22 is constructed from the graph @xmath23 , with vertices @xmath24 in such a way that for each vertex @xmath25 of @xmath23 there is a simplex containing the vertex @xmath25 , along with all vertices @xmath26 connected to it and the corresponding faces . the neighborhood complex is obtained by including all faces of those simplices and in terms of matrix representation , the incidence matrix is obtained from the adjacency matrix of @xmath23 by increasing all diagonal entries by @xmath27 .",
    "the vertices of the clique complex @xmath28 are the same as the verties of @xmath23 with the maximal complete subgraphs ( cliques ) as simplices so that it is essentially the complete subgraph complex .",
    "an example of the clique complex construction is presented in fig . @xmath27 .",
    "+    these two methods are not the only ones which may be used for constructing simplicial complexes from graphs .",
    "actually , any property of the graph @xmath23 that is preserved under deletion of vertices or edges may be used for construction purposes .",
    "a detailed account of the methods for obtaining simplicial complexes from graphs , among many other issues related to the relationship between graphs and simplicial complexes , may be found in @xcite .",
    "initially all maximal cliques ( mc ) were found using the bron - kerbosch algorithm @xcite .",
    "the resulting mc matrix contains full information about cliques , the clique s i d , size and ids of nodes that are involved in it ; from this the connection between different simplices can be deduced @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the power of the topological approach is based on the fact that simplicial complexes may be considered from three different aspect : ( 1 ) a combinatorial model of a topological space ; 2 ) a combinatorial object ; 3 ) an algebraic model .",
    "hence , different measures and invariants may be associated to the simplicial complex based on an appropriate perspective , and each one of them provides new information about the graph or network from which the simplicial complex was constructed .",
    "the first is the dimension of the simplicial complex corresponding to the maximal simplex dimension , @xmath14 .  from the combinatorial aspect three structure vectors of the simplicial complex",
    "are defined @xcite :    * the _ first structure vector _ @xmath29 : the @xmath30 entry of the so called @xmath31 of length @xmath32(or _ first structure vector _",
    "@xcite ) , denoted by @xmath33 is equal to the number of @xmath8-connectivity classes .",
    "this vector provides information on the number of connected components at each level of connectivity with initial level being equal to the dimension of the complex : @xmath34 * the _ second structure vector _",
    "@xmath35 is an integer vector with @xmath36 components @xmath37where the @xmath38 entry , @xmath39 , is equal to the number of simplices with dimension larger or equal to @xmath8 , that is , it is equal to the number of simplices at the q - level . *",
    "the _ third structure vector _",
    "@xmath40 is the global characteristic of the simplcial complex which measures the degree of connectedness on a @xmath8-level . in other words",
    ", it measures the number of @xmath8-connected components per number of simplices whose components @xmath41 are defined as @xcite : @xmath42where @xmath33 is q - th entry of the first structure vector , and @xmath39 is q - th entry of the second structure vector .",
    "in addition to these structure vectors that describe the network as a whole or its large parts , in the following we will introduce the vector associated to each node , the node s @xmath29-vector , in order to characterize neighborhood of the node in the network .",
    "ccc +      in this section , we analyze a reduced system containing @xmath43 nodes and no leaves .",
    "focusing on the large community in this network , we perform the analysis on simplices and determine the network s mc matrix .",
    "it appears that the maximal clique simplices ( in further text for brevity we use term clique ) in the network are 5-cliques , i.e. in the present notation , @xmath44 .",
    "the analyzed structures at different @xmath8-levels are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - osn_q ] .    as @xmath8 increases",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the analysis in previous sections suggests that the relation between simmelian brokerage of nodes and their topological dimension depends on the graph architecture .",
    "therefore , by varying the building rules of the network , one can vary the topological dimensions of different nodes and test the robustness of eq .",
    "( [ eq - bi - dimqi ] ) .",
    "we consider several types that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - nets - grown ] . in these networks ,",
    "the node s neighborhood can be varied by control parameters of the growth , ranging from the tree - like to a highly clustered compact structure .",

    "@xcite is implemented for the case where different communities ( node groups ) are allowed to grow .",
    "thus , the attachment of new nodes is preferred within a currently growing community while rewiring can take part both within and outside of that community .",
    "three parameters that control the structure are : @xmath48the probability of a new community , @xmath49 and @xmath50that appear in the preferential shift - linear rules for attachment and rewiring probabilities @xcite , respectively , and @xmath51the number of nodes added per growth step . in addition , we consider a dense single - community graph consisting of 100 nodes , shown in fig .",

    "it demonstrates that social network dynamics leads to unusual local structures , including cliques up to the fifth order and to complexes consisting of the cliques sharing triangle faces and tetrahedra .",
    "the structure of emotion - propagating layers is much simpler , containing triangles as the highest order structures .",
    "it should be noted that , in another study @xcite , triadic closure dynamics was recognized as one of the fundamental dynamic principles in social multiplex networks .",
    "the node s @xmath59-vector associated with every node of the simplicial complex , defined here for the first time , differentiates in a precise manner different topological and hence graph structures which contain the reference node .",
    "its components @xmath60 indicate the number of structures at each hierarchical level in which the node participates . the total number of cliques of all sizes in which the node resides defines the node s topological dimension .",
    "the concept of the node s structure vector has been useful in sequencing the social network , revealing a new insight into network organization from local to the global level and the role of individual nodes in it . in particular , ranking the nodes according to their topological dimension obeys zipf s law with two slopes .",
    "this feature helps to distinguish a smaller group of innovative nodes that build large surroundings or surroundings with a larger topological complexity , from the rest of the system .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that this vector provides a useful quantitative measure of social capital of nodes in the communities and layers .",
    "specifically , simmelian brokerage , which measures the ability of a node to act as a broker between groups of other nodes in the recognized community or layer , scales as a power of the node s topological dimension .",
    "this functional relationship holds in a class of networks with varied composition .",
    "the scaling exponent has an exact value @xmath61 in tree structures and decreases towards lower values in the case of graphs that contain a number of larger complexes ( cliques with shared faces ) .",
    "the influential nodes which possess considerable social capital can be further differentiated by considering the individual components @xmath60 of their topology vectors .",
    "two types of influential nodes can be observed .",
    "first , there are `` informer '' nodes that act as centers of star - like structures in the network ; occurrence of such nodes is in the direct relationship with disassortativity of network s dynamical structure , observed in @xcite .",
    "second , the nodes that connect a large number of higher - order structures ( for example in fig .",
    "[ fig - osn_q]d ) act as star centers in the _ conjugate _ simplicial complex network .",
    "their appearance may be related with the disassortativity of the topological dimensions , demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - dimq - zipf ] .",
    "the influential nodes build their social capital by combining links in different layers .",
    "this conclusion is reached by inspection and comparison of the simplicial structure containing these nodes in the emotion - propagating layers and the structure of the entire network , table  [ tab-2nodes ] .",
    "the metric based on the topological framework used in this work , can be also applied to discover `` key players '' in conventional social networks @xcite .",
    "similarly , it can be used to determine in - depth structure of techno - social networks that grow from scratch co - evolving with the dynamics of chats and blogs @xcite , where the origin of communities and layers can be entirely different .",
    "we expect that this approach can be useful in a variety of other network - based studies of complex systems .",
    "some examples are the brain dynamics and learning @xcite , and innovation and collaboration systems @xcite , where different patterns of the actor s behavior are essential for the global dynamics .",
