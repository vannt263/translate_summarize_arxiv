    "in epidemic studies the analysis of large amounts of personal data is essential . at the same time",
    "the dissemination of the results of those studies , even in a compact and summarized form , can provide some information that can be exploited to identify the row pertaining to a certain individual .",
    "for instance , zip code , gender and date of birth can uniquely identify 87% of individuals in the u.s .",
    "therefore when managing personal data it is of the utmost importance to effectively protect individuals privacy .",
    "one approach to deal with such problem is the @xmath0-anonymity model  @xcite .",
    "each row of a given table represents all data regarding a certain individual .",
    "then different rows are clustered together , and some entries of the rows in each cluster are suppressed ( i.e. they are replaced with a @xmath3 ) so that each cluster consists of at least @xmath0 identical rows . therefore each row @xmath4 in the resulting table is clustered with at least other @xmath5 rows identical to @xmath4 , hence the resulting data do not allow to identify any individual . while such formulation is not really sophisticated and has some practical limitations , it is definitely interesting from a theoretical point of view , as witnessed by the rich literature available .",
    "we will focus on separating the cases that can be solved efficiently from those that are intractable , therefore hinting at which strategies are likely or not going to be successfully employed when studying more sophisticated formalizations .",
    "notice that different formulations of the problem have also been proposed  @xcite , for example allowing the generalization of entry values , that is an entry value can be replaced with a less specific value  @xcite , or considering a notion of proximity among values  @xcite .",
    "a parsimonious principle leads to the optimization problem where we want to minimize the number of entries in the table to be suppressed .",
    "the @xmath0-anonymity problem is known to be apx - hard even when the matrix entries are over a _",
    "alphabet and @xmath2  @xcite , as well as when the matrix has @xmath6 columns and @xmath7 ( this time on arbitrary alphabets )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a polynomial - time @xmath8-approximation algorithm on arbitrary input alphabet , as well as approximation algorithms for restricted cases are known  @xcite . recently",
    ", two polynomial - time approximation algorithms with factor @xmath9 have been independently proposed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the parameterized complexity  @xcite of the problem , unveiling how different parameters are involved in the complexity of the problem .",
    "a first systematic study of the parameterized complexity of the @xmath0-anonymity problem has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "here , we follow the same direction , showing that the problem is w[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the solution and @xmath0 , and we provide a fixed - parameter algorithm , when the problem is parameterized by the number of columns and the maximum number of different values in any column .",
    "these problems were left open in  @xcite .    in table  [ tab : par - compl - status ] we report the status of the parameterized complexity of the @xmath0-anonymity problem , where in bold we have emphasized the new results presented in this paper .",
