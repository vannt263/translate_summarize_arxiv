    "the friendship paradox is a phenomenon observed in various social networks . the term was coined by feld  @xcite .",
    "it has been empirically observed that people s perception of their own popularity is self - aggrandizing ; most people believe that they are more popular than their friends on average  @xcite .",
    "however , feld observed that in reality , most people have fewer friends than their friends do . in  @xcite , this phenomena is used for the early detection of flu outbreaks among college students . in  @xcite , it is utilized to efficiently sample early - warning sensors during catastrophic events such as hurricanes .",
    "in addition to degree , the same paradox has been observed about other individual attributes ( called the _ generalized friendship paradox _",
    "@xcite , or gfp ) .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it has been observed that on twitter , for most people , their friends share , on average , more viral content and also tweet more . in  @xcite , it has been observed that in scientific collaboration networks , one s co - authors have , on average , more citations , more publications and more co - authors .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a network growth model which is a generalization of the preferential attachment scheme  @xcite . in our model",
    ", nodes are endowed with ` qualities ' ( ak.a .",
    "` fitness ' or ` attractiveness ' in the literature  @xcite ) .",
    "qualities are discrete positive numbers drawn from a given distribution @xmath0 and assigned to a node upon its birth ( remaining the same thenafter ) .",
    "we assume that the probability that node @xmath1 with degree @xmath2 and quality @xmath3 receives a link from subsequent nodes is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "we obtain two statistical measures of this model : one is the degree - quality joint distribution , which is the fraction of nodes that have degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 in the steady state .",
    "the second quantity is the nearest - neighbor distribution of quality and degree : it gives the fraction of nodes with degree @xmath7 and quality @xmath8 that are connected to a node with degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 .",
    "equipped with these distributions , we can quantify the paradox and study how it depends on the underlying quality distribution @xmath0 .",
    "to our knowledge , no similar theoretical result is available in the literature for any network growth model ( either purely preferential  @xcite , or fitness - based  @xcite ) .",
    "we show that employing the above scheme as the attachment mechanism renders the occurrence of the gfp contingent upon the underlying distribution of node qualities .",
    "we then employ measures defined in the literature for assessing the gfp on the network level , and we investigate the dependence of these measures on the model parameters and the quality distribution .",
    "we demonstrate that , in the proposed model , the network exhibits a quality paradox at the network level for any quality distribution .",
    "we contend that this is indicative of a positive correlation between degree and quality ; i.e. , those with higher qualities are more likely to have higher degrees , and vice versa .",
    "in the growth model considered in this paper , nodes are added successively to the network .",
    "the initial network has @xmath9 nodes and @xmath10 links . at each time step",
    ", one new node is added to the network .",
    "we assume that each node has an intrinsic quality , which is drawn from a given distribution @xmath0 .",
    "the quality is assigned to each new incoming node upon birth , and will remain the same thenafter .",
    "the mean of the distribution @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "a node of degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 is also referred to as _ a @xmath12 node _ throughout .",
    "each new incoming node attaches to @xmath13 existing nodes in the network .",
    "we consider the simplest additive model that incorporates both degree ( popularity ) and quality in the dynamics of connection formation : the probability that an existing node with degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 receives a link from the new node is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this means that , for example , a paper that is new and has very few citations can compensate for its small degree with having a high quality . or in the social context , a newcomer who does not have many friends in the new social milieu but is gregarious and sociable can elevate the chances of making new friends .",
    "the new node is called the _",
    "child _ of the existing nodes that it connects to , and they are called its _ parents_. by _ a @xmath15-@xmath12 child - parent pair _ , we mean a node with degree @xmath7 and quality @xmath8 that is connected to a parent node of degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 .    the probability that an existing node @xmath1 receives a new link is @xmath16 , where the normalization factor @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 .",

    ", the sum over the quality values of all the nodes will converge to the mean of the quality distribution times the number of nodes , that is , we can replace @xmath21 by @xmath22\\mu$ ] .",
    "so at time @xmath19 , the probability that node @xmath1 receives a link equals @xmath23 .    throughout the present paper , the steady - state joint distribution of quality and degree",
    "is denoted by @xmath24 . the expected number of nodes with degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 at time @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the expected number of @xmath15-@xmath12 child - parent pairs .",
    "we seek the steady - state fraction of nodes who have degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 . in appendix",
    "[ app : sol_1 ] we derive the following expression for this quantity : @xmath27    note that in the special case of a single permitted value for the quality ( that is , when @xmath28 $ ] ) this model reduces to the shifted - linear preferential attachment model analyzed , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "the solution in this special case simplifies to @xmath29 this coincides with the degree distribution of shifted - linear kernels given in  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  d.9 ) . furthermore , when @xmath30 , all nodes will have zero quality and attachments will be purely degree - proportional , synonymous with the conventional preferential - attachment model proposed initially in  @xcite . for the special case of @xmath31 we obtain @xmath32",
    "this is equal to the degree distribution of the conventional ba network ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "let us also examine the behavior of   in the limit of large @xmath5 . in this regime , we can use the asymptotic approximation that for large values of @xmath1 , the function @xmath33 .",
    "then we replace @xmath34 with @xmath35 , independent of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the steady - state joint degree - quality distribution @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "marginalizing out @xmath6 to recover the degree distribution , we obtain the well - known power law , @xmath36 .",
    "to quantify how qualities and degrees of adjacent nodes correlate , we need to go beyond the quality - degree distribution obtained in the previous section . the closed - form expression for the nearest - neigbor correlations under the preferential attachment model is derived in @xcite ; that work only considers degrees and does not address qualities .",
    "we would like to quantify the conditional distribution @xmath37 , the fraction of neighbours of a given node with degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 that have degree @xmath7 and quality @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ nearest - neighbor quality - degree distribution _",
    "( nnqdd ) .    in appendix",
    "[ app : sol_2 ] we study the rate equation describing how the distribution @xmath37 evolves as nodes are added to the network .",

    "in turn we have @xmath42 , which according to  , yields different sums for different quality distributions @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , gfp refers to an average alter superiority in arbitrary aspects ( e.g. , number of citations , exposure to viral online content ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the ` quality ' dimension that is incorporated in the model as the subject of the gfp .",
    "our objective is to compare the degrees and qualities of nodes with their neighbors .",
    "we say that a node experiences the friendship paradox if the degree of that node is less than the average of the degrees of its neighbors .",
    "similarly , we say that a node experiences the quality paradox if the quality of the node is less than the average of the qualities of its neighbors .",
    "the above - mentioned definitions characterize individual - level paradoxes .",
    "our primary interest is to what fraction of nodes experience the friendship and quality paradoxes . to this end",
    ", we compare the average degree of the nodes with the average degree of the neighbors of all nodes ( and similarly for quality ) .",
    "comparing these two average values yields a macro measure for the system , indicating whether it exhibits paradoxes on average .",
    "we call these as the _ network - level friendship paradox _ and _ network - level quality paradox_.    our measure of the network - level quality paradox is defined as @xmath43 .",
    "the summations are performed over all nodes in the network .",
    "note that the numerator of the first sum is actually the sum of the qualities of the neighbors of all nodes .",
    "node @xmath44 is repeated @xmath45 times in this sum , once for each of its neighbors . focusing on the limit as @xmath46",
    ", we can use the law of large numbers and express the nqp as follows @xmath47 the greater nqp becomes , the more strongly the paradox holds .",
    "negative nqp is indicative of the absence of a quality paradox at the network level .",
    "undertaking similar steps to above , we can measure the network - level friendship paradox via @xmath48    note that the numerator is the variance of the degree distribution , so it is positive .",
    "the denominator is the average degree and is also positive .",
    "so the nfp is always positive , which means that by this definition : _ any network exhibits the friendship paradox at the network level .",
    "_ so the task of the present paper with regard to the nfp is to investigate its magnitude , i.e. , to measure how strongly the paradox holds .",
    "for example , in the conventional barabasi - albert scale - free model , where the degree variance diverges , the nfp also diverges , which is a result of the presence of macro hubs .",
    "to study the nfp and the nqp in concrete settings , we confine ourselves to two quality distributions @xmath0 for illustrative purposes .",
    "we consider a finite support for @xmath6 , so that @xmath49 . for each distribution , we are going to consider four different values @xmath50 , and four different values of @xmath51 .    the first distribution we consider is the bernoulli case , where nodes can either have quality zero or quality @xmath52 .",
    "the probability of quality zero is @xmath53 and the probability of quality @xmath52 is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "the second distribution we consider is the discrete exponential distribution with decay factor @xmath56 .",
    "the probability that the quality is @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath58 , one recovers a uniform distribution as a special case .",
    "we consider both @xmath59 and @xmath60 , yielding decreasing and increasing distributions in @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these distributions are depicted in figure  [ distributions ] .",
    ".48       0.48    the results for the bernoulli quality distribution are depicted in figure  [ bernoulli ] .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ nqp_fixed_theta ] , for a fixed @xmath52 , the nqp decreases as @xmath50 ( the initial degree of nodes ) increases . also , it is observable that the sensitivity of the nqp to the variations of the quality distribution diminishes for larger values of @xmath50 .    as illustrated in figure",
    "[ nfp_fixed_theta ] , the nfp increases as @xmath50 ( the initial degree of nodes ) increases . hence , according to   _ the variance of the degree distribution grows faster than the mean degree , as @xmath50 increases . _ on the other hand , for a given @xmath50 , increasing @xmath52 ( which is tantamount to increasing @xmath11 ) , increases the nqp .",
    "this means that according to   _ as @xmath52 increases , the mean of the qualities of the neighbors increases faster than the mean of the qualities of the nodes_.    figure  [ nqp_fixed_beta ] pertains to this case .",
    "observe that as @xmath52 increases , the nqp becomes more sensitive to the distribution of qualities .",
    "finally , figure  [ nfp_fixed_beta ] represents the nfp for a fixed @xmath50 and different values of @xmath52 . from figures",
    "[ nqp_fixed_theta ] ,  [ nfp_fixed_theta ] ,  [ nqp_fixed_beta ] and  [ nfp_fixed_beta ] , a general observable pattern is that as @xmath53 increases , the nfp increases ( monotonically for almost all values of @xmath53 ) , whereas the nqp is concave and unimodal ( it increases at first , achieves maximum , and then decreases ) .",
    ".5     0.5      +    0.5     0.5    now we focus on the exponential quality distribution with the decay factor denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ nqp_fixed_theta_decay ] , for a given @xmath52 , the nqp decreases as @xmath50 increases .",
    "also , it is observed that as @xmath50 increases , the sensitivity of the nqp to the quality distribution diminishes .",
    "these are both similar to the results of the bernoulli distribution .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ nfp_fixed_theta_decay ] , the nfp increases as @xmath50 increases .",
    "so similar to the bernoulli case , the variance of the degree distribution grows faster than the mean degree , as @xmath50 increases .    from figure  [ nqp_fixed_beta_decay ]",
    "we observe that for a fixed @xmath50 , increasing @xmath52 increases the nqp .",
    "we observe that as @xmath52 increases , nqp becomes more sensitive to the changes in the decay factor .",
    "finally , figure  [ nfp_fixed_beta_decay ] represents the nfp for a fixed @xmath50 and different values of @xmath52 .",
    "we observe that increasing @xmath52 increases the nfp for positive decays .",
    "also , for very small decay factors ( which generate right - skewed distributions that are highly unequal ) , changing @xmath52 has scant effect on the nfp .",
    "this is reasonable because when the decay factor is small , all large values of @xmath6 have small chances of occurrence .",
    "consequently , changing @xmath52 minimally changes the shape of the distribution for small decay factors .",
    "a trend is discernible from figures  [ nqp_fixed_theta_decay ] ,  [ nfp_fixed_theta_decay ] ,  [ nqp_fixed_beta_decay ] and  [ nfp_fixed_beta_decay ] : as @xmath56 increases , the nfp decreases ( monotonically for all values of @xmath56 ) , whereas nqp is concave and increases up to a point around @xmath61 , and then decreases .",
    "since @xmath58 yields a uniform distribution , we can qualitatively conclude that the probability of the network - level quality paradox is higher when qualities are heterogeneous , as compared to when qualities are similar .    finally , to verify our results , we run monte carlo simulations to synthesize networks that grow under the prescribed quality - based preferential attachment mechanism , and then calculate the desired quantities by averaging over nodes in the synthesized network . due to computational limitations , we restrict this validation to the case where @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the bernoulli quality distribution and the case where @xmath62 and @xmath64 for the exponential quality distribution . these results are shown in figures  [ nqp_fixed_theta ] ,  [ nfp_fixed_theta ] ,  [ nqp_fixed_theta_decay ] and  [ nfp_fixed_theta_decay ] .",
    "the markers show the results of simulations , averaging over 100 monte carlo trials , and the solid curves correspond to our theoretical expressions .",
    "we have tested the results on various other quality distributions and observed similar results ; these additional simulations not reported here due to space limitations . in general , we observe that for a fixed @xmath52 , increasing @xmath50 increases the nfp and decreases the nqp regardless of the quality distribution .",
    "also , for a fixed @xmath50 , increasing @xmath52 increases the nqp and decreases the nfp .",
    ".5    0.5     +    0.5    0.5    note that in all cases the nqp is nonnegative .",
    "this has roots in the correlation between degree and quality of single nodes ( intra - node correlation , rather than inter - node correlation ) .",
    "let us denote the correlation between degree and quality for a node by @xmath65 , which is the pearson correlation coefficient obtained from the joint distribution @xmath24 .",
    "from  , we have :",
    "@xmath66    this implies that the sign of nqp is the same as the sign of @xmath65 ( since @xmath67 and @xmath68 are nonnegative ) .",
    "the observation that nqp is always nonegative indicates that @xmath65 is also always nonegative .",
    "we conclude that _ the quality - dependent preferential attachment model generates networks in which degree and quality of a node are always positively correlated .",
    "_ this is what we intuitively expect the model to exhibit ; increasing quality increases degree .",
    "for example , in citation networks , papers with higher qualities receive more citations .",
    "conversely , a paper with many citations is more likely to have a high quality . in the case of friendship networks ,",
    "a person that is more sociable ends up with more friends than an anti - social person , and conversely , a popular person is more likely to be friendly than an isolated person .",
    "we also observe that in all cases , @xmath11 ( equivalently , @xmath52 ) and @xmath50 have opposite effects on both the nfp and the nqp .",
    "that is , the effect of increasing @xmath50 is akin to that of decreasing @xmath11 , and vice versa .",
    "we observed similar trends for other quality distributions ; these results are omitted here due to space limitations .",
    "what causes this disparity is the following : as can be seen in   and  , @xmath11 only appears in the distributions in the form of @xmath69 . thus increasing @xmath11 and decreasing @xmath50 have the same effect on this variable , and consequently , on the distribution .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to put in crisp theoretical focus the seemingly prevalent phenomena of the friendship paradox and the generalized friendship paradox .",
    "we proposed a network growth model that incorporates quality . in this model , the probability that a node receives a link increases with both its degree and quality .",
    "we analysed the model theoretically in the steady - state ( large size limit ) , and found two theoretical quantities that characterize the interrelation between quality and degree .",
    "the first quantity is @xmath24 , which is the joint degree - quality distribution , and equals the fraction of nodes who have degree @xmath5 and quality @xmath6 .",
    "the second quantity characterizes nearest - neighbor correlations , and is the nearest - neighbor quality - degree distribution , denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "we then defined two network - level measures for the quality and friendship paradoxes and computed them for two particular examples of quality distributions .",
    "we observed that for a fixed @xmath52 , increasing @xmath50 increases the nfp and decreases the nqp regardless of the quality distribution .",
    "we also observed that for a fixed @xmath50 , increasing @xmath52 increases the nqp and decreases the nfp .",
    "we also observed that @xmath11 and @xmath50 have opposite effects on the nfp and also on the nqp .",
    "we also tested these results on various other quality distributions , and they proved robust ; the effects of @xmath50 and @xmath11 on paradoxes are opposite regardless of the quality distribution .",
    "there are many interesting extensions of this work to pursue .",
    "in addition to the network - level paradox , we can also study the individual - level paradox , which would require the utilization of the nnqdd to compare the degrees and qualities of nodes with those of their neighbors .",
