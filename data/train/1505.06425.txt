    "this numbers are mostly used in solving different physical problems in electrodynamics , field theory , etc .",
    "somehow or other , hypercomplex number systems and their applications to data processing are beautiful enough to be worth studying simply for the pleasure of it .",
    "the multiplication of two hypercomplex numbers is often one of the more time consuming operations .",
    "the reason for this is , because the addition of @xmath0-dimensional hypercomplex numbers requires @xmath0 real additions , while the multiplication of these numbers already requires @xmath1 real additions and @xmath2 real multiplication .",
    "it is easy to see that the increasing of dimensions of hypercomplex number increases the computational complexity of the multiplication .",
    "therefore , reducing the computational complexity of the multiplication of hypercomplex numbers is an important scientific and engineering problem .",
    "efficient algorithms for the multiplication of various hypercomplex numbers already exist @xcite .",

    "the results of all possible products of kaluza numbers imaginary units can be summarized in the following table :    margin = 0 20 0 25 +    width=0.99 , margin = 0 0 0 10 @xmath8    [ tab1 ]    width=0.99 @xmath9    [ tab2 ]    width=0.99 @xmath10    [ tab3 ]    width=0.99 @xmath11    [ tab4 ]    suppose we want to compute the product of two kaluza numbers .",

    "the direct multiplication of two kaluza requires 1024 real multiplications and 992 real additions . we shall present the algorithm , which reduce arithmetical complexity to 512 real multiplications and 576 real additions .    at first , we rearrange the rows of the matrix in the following order \\{1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 5 , 9 , 4 , 8 , 6 , 10 , 11 , 17 , 13 , 19 , 15 , 21 , 12 , 18 , 14 , 20 , 16 , 22 , 23 , 27 , 25 , 29 , 24 , 28 , 26 , 30 , 31 , 32}. next , we rearrange the columns of obtained matrix in the same manner . as a result ,",

    "there is an effective method of factorization of this type matrices , which allows during the calculation of the vector - matrix products halve the number of multiplications , that is to perform only two , not four multiplications at the expense of triple increasing the number of additions ( from two to six ) @xcite :    @xmath46 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x_{0 } \\\\",
