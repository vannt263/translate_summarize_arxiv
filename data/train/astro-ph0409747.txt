    "kroupa & weidner ( 2003 ) showed that the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function ( igimf ) is obtained by summing up the stellar imfs contributed by all the star clusters that formed over the age of a galaxy . in their approach the mass of the most massive star in an embedded cluster with stellar mass @xmath1",
    "is calculated from by @xmath2 the resulting function @xmath3 is quantified by @xcite who infer that there exists a fundamental upper stellar mass limit , @xmath4 , because otherwise the populous cluster r136 would contain too many stars with m @xmath5 .",
    "in order to verify the above results we here perform monte - carlo simulations of star clusters and the stars within . 50 million clusters are randomly chosen from a power - law cmf between 5 @xmath0 and @xmath6 and with a salpeter index @xmath7 .",
    "these clusters are then filled with stars in two ways .",
    "first stars were taken randomly from a canonical kroupa - imf and their masses added until the sum equalled the chosen cluster ( _ long dashed line _ in fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the second way , a number of stars given by the mass of the cluster divided by an estimate of the mean stellar mass are randomly chosen , sorted and then added - starting with the least massive star ( _ short dashed line _ in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the addition is terminated as soon as the cluster mass is reached , or the process is repeated if the cluster mass is not reached .",
    "the sorted igimf agrees very well with the semi - analytical results while the igimf from pure random adding shows a somewhat less steeper slope .",
    "* the monte - carlo simulations confirm the results of our semi - analytical formalism .",
    "* integrated galactic imfs must always be steeper for @xmath8 than the stellar imf that results from a local star - formation event ."

    "<S> as most if not all stars are born in stellar clusters the shape of the mass function of the field stars is not only determined by the initial mass function of stars ( imf ) but also by the cluster mass function ( cmf ) . in order to quantify this monte - carlo simulations </S>",
    "<S> were carried out by taking cluster masses randomly from a cmf and then populating these clusters with stars randomly taken from an imf . </S>",
    "<S> two cases were studied . </S>",
    "<S> firstly the star masses were added randomly until the cluster mass was reached . </S>",
    "<S> secondly a number of stars , given by the cluster mass divided by an estimate of the mean stellar mass and sorted by mass , were added until the desired cluster mass was reached . </S>",
    "<S> both experiments verified the analytical results of kroupa & weidner ( 2003 ) that the resulting integrated stellar initial mass function is a folding of the imf with the cmf and therefore steeper than the input imf above 1 @xmath0 . </S>"
