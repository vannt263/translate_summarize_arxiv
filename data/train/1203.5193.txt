    "the goals of the beam energy scan program at bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are to search for the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) critical point as well as the phase transition boundary between partonic and hadronic phases @xcite . by systematic study of au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 5 @xmath5 200 gev",
    ", one could access a wide region of temperature @xmath6 and baryon chemical potential @xmath7 in the qcd phase diagram . due to its small hadronic cross section",
    ", the @xmath0-meson may decouple early from the system , which makes it an important probe to study early partonic evolution in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . in au+au collisions at rhic with @xmath8 gev ,",
    "the baryon - meson separation of @xmath0-mesons @xmath3 and number - of - constituent - quark ( ncq ) scaling for @xmath0-meson @xmath1 at intermediate transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) have provided evidence for the formation of a new kind of deconfined matter with partonic collectivity @xcite .",
    "because of the possible transition from partonic dominated phase to hadronic dominated phase , it is expected that the established paradigm for partonic degrees of freedom at top rhic energy may break at a given low collision energy . especially , the absence or reduction of collective flow and the breaking of ncq scaling for @xmath0-mesons could indicate the system in hadronic dominated phase @xcite . with the fully installed barrel time - of - flight detector ( tof ) @xcite in the year 2010 ,",
    "the signal - to - background ratio of reconstructed @xmath0-mesons is greatly enhanced , which improves the measurement of @xmath0-meson @xmath4 significantly at lower energies . here",
    ", we discuss the energy dependence of @xmath0-meson @xmath1 and @xmath3 in au + au collisions at @xmath2 = 7.7 , 11.5 , and 39 gev , based on data taken from star experiment at rhic in the year 2010 .",

    "after the event selection , we obtain about 4 million , 12 million , and 130 million au+au minimum bias triggered events at @xmath2 = 7.7 , 11.5 , and 39 gev , respectively . for the @xmath0-meson @xmath1 analysis at 39 gev , we use the full statistics ( 130 million ) , while part of the statistics ( 16 million ) is used for spectra analysis at present .",

    "this means no significant suppression in au+au 39 gev , which is quite different from au+au 200 gev case .",
    "we note that it does not mean that there is no nuclear or medium effect , since there could be interplay between the cronin effect ( parton @xmath9 broadening due to multiple scatterings ) which enhances hadron yields at intermediate @xmath9 @xcite and parton energy loss that suppresses the yields .",
    "however , the data may suggest a smaller parton energy loss in au+au 39 gev than that in au+au 200 gev . at 11.5 gev , the @xmath0-meson @xmath3(0 - 10%/40%-60% )",

    "the baryon - meson separation between @xmath0-meson and proton ( or @xmath24 ) @xmath1 at @xmath25 gev/@xmath12 supports the quark coalescence picture in au+au 39 gev collisions . at low @xmath9 ,",
    "the @xmath0-meson @xmath1 is smaller than those of the proton and @xmath24 , thus violates the mass ordering observed in au+au 200 gev collisions .",
