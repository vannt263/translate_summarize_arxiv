    "recently physicists have been studying social phenomena and dynamics leading to the growth of the interdisciplinary field of `` sociophysics '' @xcite .",
    "one of the problems is of `` opinion formation '' , which is a collective dynamical phenomenon , and as such is closely related to the problems of competing cultures or languages @xcite .",
    "it deals with a `` measurable '' response of the society to e.g. , political issues , acceptances of innovations , etc .",
    "numerous models of competing options have been introduced to study this phenomenon , e.g. , the `` voter '' model ( which has a binary opinion variable with the opinion alignment proceeding by a random choice of neighbors ) @xcite , or the sznajd - weron discrete opinion formation model ( where more than just a pair of spins is associated with the decision making procedure ) @xcite .",
    "there have been other studies of systems with more than just two possible opinions @xcite , or where the opinion of individuals is represented by a `` continuous '' variable @xcite using real numbers .",
    "also , since opinion formation in a human society is mediated by social interactions between individuals , such social dynamics has been considered to take place on a network of relationships ( see @xcite for recent review on such models ) .",
    "a two body exchange dynamics has already been developed in the context of modelling income , money or wealth distributions in a society @xcite .",
    "the general aim was to study a many - agent statistical model of closed economy ( analogous to the kinetic theory model of ideal gases ) @xcite , where @xmath0 agents exchange a quantity @xmath1 , that may be defined as wealth .",
    "the states of agents are characterized by the wealth @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 and the total wealth @xmath4 is conserved .",
    "the question of interest is : `` what is the equilibrium distribution of wealth @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 is the probability that in the steady state of the system , a randomly chosen agent will be found to have wealth between @xmath1 and @xmath7 ? ''",
    "the evolution of the system is carried out according to a prescription , which defines the trading rule between agents .",
    "the agents interact with each other through a pair - wise interaction characterized by a `` saving '' parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics of the model ( cc ) is as follows @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 is a stochastic variable , changing with time",
    ". it can be noticed that in this way , the quantity @xmath1 is conserved during the single transactions : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the agent wealths after the transaction has taken place . in general , the functional form for steady state distribution @xmath5 is seen to be close to the @xmath16-distribution @xcite . as a further generalization",
    ", the agents could be assigned different saving propensities and the steady state distribution @xmath5 show pareto - like power - law behavior asymptotically @xcite .",
    "earlier , toscani @xcite had introduced and discussed kinetic models of ( continuous ) opinion formation involving both exchange of opinion between individual agents and diffusion of information .",
    "based on this model , during et al @xcite proposed another mathematical model for opinion formation in a society that is built of two groups , one group of ` ordinary ' people and one group of ` strong opinion leaders ' .",
    "starting from microscopic interactions among individuals , they arrived at a macroscopic description of the opinion formation process .",
    "they discussed the steady states of the system , and extended it to incorporate emergence and decline of opinion leaders .",
    "here , we report the studies of a minimal model for the collective dynamics of opinion formation in the society , based on kinetic exchanges .",
    "following the cc model described in the earlier section , we present a minimal model @xcite for the collective dynamics of opinion @xmath17 of the @xmath18-th person in the society , consisting of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) persons .",
    "we assume that any particular person can discuss ( interact ) only with one other person each time ( time increases discretely by unity after each such discussion ) .",
    "a two - person `` discussion '' is viewed here as a simple two - body _ scattering process _ in physics .",
    "persons in the society may bump onto each other randomly and exchange opinions through such random two - person discussions .",
    "in general , a person @xmath18 could have any opinion @xmath21 between two extreme polarities denoted by + 1 and -1 . in any discussion at time @xmath22 , a person _",
    "retains _ a fraction of his / her older opinion @xmath23 , determined by his / her `` conviction '' , parameterized by @xmath24 .",
    "this parameter value is characteristic of a person and does not change with time @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , the person @xmath18 is `` influenced '' stochastically by the other person @xmath26 during the discussion having the `` influence '' parameter equal to his / her conviction parameter @xmath27 .",
    "we further assume for simplicity that all agents are _ homogeneous _  have the _ same _ conviction parameter @xmath8 .",
    "mathematically the dynamics may be represented by @xmath28 where the opinion @xmath29 for all agents @xmath30 and time @xmath31 , the conviction parameter @xmath9 is _ quenched _ ( does not change with time ) , and the stochastic parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are _ annealed _ variables ( change with time) uncorrelated random numbers uniformly distributed between zero and unity . note that the equations are linear , but non - linearity is introduced in this model by imposing that @xmath34 for all agents @xmath30 and times @xmath31 .     for large @xmath31 ( steady state value of @xmath35 ) against @xmath8 , following dynamics of eq .",

    "the question we are interested is that if such social dynamics continually take place , can any consensus be reached or polarity evolve after a long time ?",
    "mathematically , we are interested in the steady state distribution of @xmath37 and other statistical properties .",
    "it is noteworthy that unlike in the market models , here we have no conservation of opinion .",
    "rather , the steady state of value of @xmath38 represents the order of the average opinion in the society after a long time @xmath31 .",
    "we study the relaxation dynamics in the society : the relaxation and fluctuation of @xmath35 , the steady state value of @xmath39 for @xmath40 , the relaxation time .",
    "remarkably , we find there is appearance of `` polarity '' or consensus , starting from initial random disorder ( where @xmath41 s are uniformly distributed with positive and negative values ) . in the language of physics , there is a `` spontaneous symmetry breaking '' transition in the system : starting from @xmath42 the system evolves either to the `` para '' state with @xmath43 ( where all individual agents have the opinion @xmath44 ) for @xmath45 , or ( _ continuously _ ) to the `` symmetry broken '' state @xmath46 ( where _ all _ individuals have either positive or negative opinions ) for @xmath47 ( see fig .

    "( [ op2 ] ) , can perhaps be reproduced by the following simple iterative map @xmath52 with the restriction that @xmath53 , which is ensured by assuming that if @xmath54 , @xmath55 is set equal to 1 . as usual",
    ", @xmath32 is a stochastic variable ranging between 0 and 1 ( assumed to be uniformly distributed in our case ) . in a mean - field approach ,",
    "the above equation reduces effectively to a multiplier map like @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "clearly for @xmath58 , @xmath55 converges to zero .",
    "the initial value @xmath59 , is assigned either a positive or negative value .",
    "if it starts from a positive ( negative ) value , @xmath60 remains positive ( negative ) .",
    "we note that there are subtle differences in the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ op2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ op3 ] ) .",
    "apart from the absence of `` spontaneous symmetry breaking '' of the multi - agent model ( from @xmath61 values to all positive or all negative transition beyond @xmath49 ) , the nature of the phase transition ( singularity ) in the iterative map is also slightly different . the critical value @xmath62 has an analytical derivation @xcite , but for most numerical studies done here , we take @xmath63 .",
    "the time variation of the average opinion @xmath64 , where @xmath30 refers to different initial realizations and @xmath19 refers to the total of all such realizations , and its fluctuations are studied numerically ( see fig .  [",

    "we note again that the fluctuation in @xmath35 does not diverge , and shows a cusp near @xmath63 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_map ] ) .",
    "we also note that the steady state fluctuation @xmath66 near @xmath49 , is generally much higher in magnitude for the map case .      for both the multi - agent model and the iterative map , we study the variation ( with @xmath8 ) of the fraction @xmath67 of the agents having @xmath68 at any time @xmath31 in the steady state ( @xmath40 ) . this parameter @xmath67 gives the average `` condensation '' fraction ( of people in the society having extreme opinions @xmath69 ) in the steady state . the growth of @xmath70 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_map - multi ] , is seen to be similar to that of @xmath35 .",
    "the inset shows that the growth behavior for @xmath70 above ( respective ) @xmath49 , for both the multi - agent model and map , are identical .",
    "we studied the relaxation behavior of @xmath35 and @xmath70 , for both the multi - agent model and map . in each case , the relaxation time is estimated numerically from the time value at which @xmath35 or @xmath67 first touches the steady state value within a pre - assigned error limit .",
    "we find diverging growth of relaxation time @xmath50 ( for both @xmath35 and @xmath67 ) near @xmath71 ( see fig .  [ fig : relaxmap ] ) .",
    "the values of exponent @xmath72 for the divergence in @xmath73 have been estimated numerically for both the multi - agent model and the map ( for both @xmath74 and @xmath75 , wherever accurate data were obtained ) .",
    "for the multi agent model , the fitting values for exponent @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath67 , respectively , are @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for the map case , the fitting values for exponent @xmath72 corresponding to both @xmath35 and @xmath67 , turn out to be the same :",

    "the variation of the steady state value @xmath67 against @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_map ] .",
    "it may be noted that while the steady state value of @xmath35 starts to grow from @xmath80 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : hist ] , we give the numerical results for the steady state distribution opinion , @xmath87 for three different values of @xmath8 ; we observe roughly a bi - modal nature of the distribution as @xmath88 : one mode is the uniform distribution within the range @xmath89 ( and @xmath90 ) and another a delta function at @xmath91 .",
    "we therefore approximate the steady state distribution of opinion by assuming that opinion @xmath55 is distributed uniformly starting from a minimum @xmath92 upto unity with ( integrated ) probability @xmath93 , and a @xmath94-function at exactly unity with probability @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "we have assumed that the value @xmath60 stays in those two regions ( from @xmath8 to 1 and exactly at 1 ) with probability @xmath93 and @xmath67 .",

    "( [ av opi ] ) , we derive the result that @xmath104 which is compared with the numerical simulations for @xmath88 in fig .  [",

    "it is evident that the approximation holds well , only for @xmath88 .    )",
    "( in red squares ) with the numerical simulations for @xmath88 , following dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ op3 ] ) ( in black circles ) . ]",
    "in summary , we proposed a minimal model for the collective dynamics of opinion formation in the society , by modifying kinetic exchange dynamics studied in the context of markets .",
    "the multi - agent model ( dynamics given by eq .  ( [ op2 ] ) ) and its map version ( dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ op3 ] ) ) have kinetic exchange like linear contributions from random two - person discussions or scattering processes , though the saturation of @xmath105 induces non - linearity in the dynamics .",
    "this model has an intriguing spontaneous symmetry breaking transition to polarized opinion state starting from non - polarized opinion state .",
    "specifically , in the multi - agent model , we see that for @xmath106 , starting from random positive and negative @xmath21 values ( or for that matter any arbitrary state ) , at @xmath107 , the system eventually evolves to a state at @xmath108 where _ all _ @xmath21 are either positive or negative , with @xmath109 determined by the @xmath110 value ! this is similar to the growth of spontaneous magnetization in ising magnets ( where starting from arbitrary up and down spin states , a preferred direction is chosen by fluctuation ) , with magnetization determined by the temperature below its transition value .",
    "the appearance of spontaneous symmetry breaking in this simple kinetic opinion exchange model is truly remarkable .",
    "it appears to be one of the simplest collective dynamical model of many - body dynamics showing non - trivial phase transition behaviour .",
    "indeed , it may be noted that for @xmath111 , at @xmath108 , _ all _ @xmath21 s become identically zero ( without any fluctuation ) , while for @xmath112 , @xmath21 s have fluctuations but the average has a steady state value depending on the value of @xmath110 .",
    "as such the nature of the phase transition in this model is quite different and does not fit to the commonly studied three absorbing state models studied ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to understand the nature of the transition , we also studied a simple iterative map and derived approximate result for the order parameter variation under certain limits , which compares quite well with the numerical simulations .",
    "specifically , we find that the fraction @xmath70 of people with extreme opinion @xmath113 , and its fluctuations determine the nature of the phase transition in our model and locate the critical point accurately ( from numerical studies ) . with the two mode distribution ( uniform and delta ) of @xmath114 ,",
