    "in the limit of vanishing @xmath1- and @xmath2-quark masses the qcd hamiltonian has chiral @xmath3 symmetry . the symmetry group would be @xmath4 , if also the strange quark is treated as massless .",
    "the qcd vacuum does not , however , have the same symmetry , and the symmetry is said to be hidden , or spontaneously broken . as a consequence",
    ", the goldstone theorem dictates that massless pseudoscalar mesons appear .",
    "they acquire a mass through the small , but nonzero , quark masses .",
    "the quark masses also shift the mass of the proton .",
    "the proton matrix element of the light quark mass term in the hamiltonian , the sigma - term , is a measure of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the sigma - term is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the proton mass and @xmath8 denotes the physical one - proton state normalized as @xmath9 .",
    "algebraically @xmath10 can be written in the form @xmath11 the combination @xmath12 can be calculated in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , and with @xmath13 an estimate can be given in different orders of the quark mass expansion @xmath14 the corrections to the leading order calculation reflect the meson cloud effects .",
    "the result of the order @xmath15 is from ref . [",
    "1,2 ] and the @xmath16 result from ref . [ 3 ] . in the ozi rule limit ( @xmath17 )",
    "a value for @xmath10 follows to a given order of the quark mass expansion .",
    "a low - energy theorem of chiral symmetry allows for another determination of the @xmath10-term .",
    "namely , the pion - nucleon scattering amplitude at a particular unphysical ( but on - shell ) point , so called the cheng - dashen point , can be related to the nucleon scalar form factor up to corrections of order @xmath18 [ 4 ] @xmath19 here @xmath20 mev is the pion decay constant , @xmath21 denotes the isoscalar combination of the pion - nucleon amplitudes @xmath22 , where the pseudovector born term has been subtracted , i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath24 in terms of the mandelstam variables and @xmath25 is the pion mass .",
    "the scalar form factor @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 the correction term , @xmath28 , is formally of order @xmath29 , and to one loop in chiral perturbation theory [ 5 ] @xmath30 mev .",
    "an estimate for the upper limit of @xmath28 including all terms of the order @xmath16 is 2 mev [ 6 ] ( it is the upper limit , because the sign of the contribution from the scalar meson is unknown ; the conservative choice is taken in [ 6 ] ) . also , to this order in the quark mass expansion no chiral logarithm is found . in view of this result ,",
    "the approximation @xmath31 is good enough for the present level of accuracy .",
    "in addition to fixing the value of @xmath32 from pion - nucleon information , one still has to consider the @xmath33-dependence of the scalar form factor to get an estimate for @xmath10 ( @xmath34 , so the quantity of interest is @xmath35 the first calculation was published in ref . [",
    "7 ] and later more refined results were given in [ 1,5 ] .",
    "chpt to one loop gives [ 5 ] @xmath36 , which , however , corresponds to the treatment of the pion - pion scattering at tree level . in [ 8 ]",
    "@xmath37 was calculated with a dispersion relation with @xmath38 input consistent with chpt .",
    "the result is @xmath39 which is also obtained by bernard et al .",
    "[ 9 ] in a calculation which includes some of the contributions of order @xmath40 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "5 and 7 the @xmath10 can be calculated once @xmath32 is fixed from pion - nucleon information , namely @xmath41 i.e. the difference between @xmath32 and @xmath10 is about 15 mev with relatively small uncertainty in comparison with the current uncertainties in @xmath32 and the chpt result for @xmath42 .",
    "some time ago koch used [ 10 ] hyperbolic dispersion relations to determine @xmath32 and got the result @xmath43 where the uncertainty reflects the internal consistency of the method . to be able to estimate the uncertainty due to the experimental errors of the low - energy data , a dispersion method was proposed in ref . [ 11 ] .",
    "that approach involves six forward dispersion relations , the standard ones for @xmath44 and @xmath45 and , in addition , two dispersion relations for the newly defined amplitudes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pion total energy .",
    "the point here is that in the low - energy range the 2 @xmath48-waves and 4 @xmath49-waves matter , and the @xmath2- and @xmath50-waves can be treated as corrections ( to be taken from an existing phase shift analysis ; ka85 ) .",
    "the six dispersion relations will give six energy dependent functions , the partial wave amplitudes @xmath51 .",
    "the method is a low - energy approach ; it makes sense only to the extent that @xmath2- and higher partial waves can be treated as corrections . in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] it was assumed that the @xmath2-waves were accurate to 30 % , and the error estimate there involved variations of the @xmath2-waves by that amount around the ka85 values [ 13 ] .",
    "in addition to the low - energy @xmath52 waves , input is needed for the higher energies .",
    "( the `` high '' energy piece starts here at the pion momentum @xmath53 mev / c corresponding to a laboratory kinetic energy of 92 mev . ) in this range the imaginary parts of the invariant amplitudes @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are needed , and they are constructed from partial wave solutions of the karlsruhe group ( kh80 , ka84 and ka85 ) and , also , from solutions fa93 , sm95 [ 14 ] and sm97 of the vpi group . for the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitudes karlsruhe forms [ 15 ] have been adopted .",
    "the six dispersion relations fully fix the amplitudes up to two subtraction constants both of which have their origin in the @xmath57 amplitude .",
    "the subtraction constant in the dispersion relation for @xmath58 is proportional to the @xmath48-wave scattering length @xmath59 , and the subtraction constant for the @xmath60 amplitude to @xmath61 .",
    "once these two threshold parameters are known , the amplitude is fully fixed .",
    "experimental data at low energies ( below the momentum @xmath62 ) will be needed to determine @xmath59 and @xmath61 . at the lowest energies",
    "there are results from differential cross section measurements which are used as input in the @xmath63 search . for each data set the contribution to the total",
    "@xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the experimental differential cross section with error @xmath66 .",
    "the computed cross section is denoted by @xmath67 , and it contains the full observable cross section constructed from the solutions for the hadronic amplitudes from the dispersion relations , and the electromagnetic corrections according to the formalism of tromborg et al . [ 16 ] .",
    "also , the p@xmath68 splitting between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 channels has been taken into account .",
    "for each data set there is one parameter @xmath71 which takes care of the normalization of that set , i.e. in the present analysis there is a contribution to the @xmath63 from the normalization .",
    "however , it does not depend on the number of data points in the data set .",
    "the experimental normalization uncertainty has been used for @xmath72 , if given in the experimental paper .",
    "the iterative procedure for solving the coupled dispersion relations has then the following steps :    1 .",
    "take initial values for @xmath73 , and set @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "2 .   construction of the imaginary parts of the six invariant amplitudes for all momenta .",
    "solution of the dispersion relations .",
    "partial waves from the real parts of the invariant amplitudes at low energy .",
    "back to step 2 until the phase shifts stabilize .",
    "usually only a few iterations are needed to get smooth partial wave amplitudes .",
    "it is practical to write the subthreshold expansion at the origin of the @xmath77 -plane @xmath78 where two of the constants can be directly related to the dispersion relations @xmath79 the expression for @xmath32 then gets the form @xmath80 where the curvature term @xmath81 is dominated by the @xmath38 cut giving [ 8 ] @xmath82 however , there is also the left - hand cut contribution , so a new @xmath83 analysis could modify this number slightly .",
    "the term linear in @xmath33 is a relatively sensitive quantity as can be seen from the numbers for the solutions a and b in [ 12 ] @xmath84 where the first figure corresponds to the @xmath85 contribution and the second the @xmath86 piece .",
    "the problem with the sigma values used to be that the value for @xmath87 , the strange quark content , tended to be large in view of what could reasonably be expected for the strange quark contribution for the proton mass .",
    "then it turned out [ 8,12 ] , however , that the @xmath33-dependence of the scalar form factor was underestimated in the previous analyses , and that the new value @xmath88 led to a more reasonable result , about 130 mev of the proton mass coming from the strange quark piece [ 12 ] .",
    "this analysis relied heavily on the karlsruhe amplitudes , which included data from the 70 s and earlier .",
    "so only a very limited amount of information from the meson factories was incorporated . especially at low energies",
    "new measurements have been performed for different observables .",
    "new data point to some changes in the karlsruhe amplitudes , but there is , at present , no general agreement of the new amplitudes , because even the new data contain conflicts .",
    "also , the discussion of the value of the @xmath83 coupling constant has continued with increasing vigour . in [ 12 ]",
    "it was not possible to check the dependence of the values of @xmath32 on the pion - nucleon coupling , because one was bound to use the coupling strength corresponding to the input amplitudes , i.e. the karlsruhe value @xmath89 ; @xmath90 .",
    "the vpi group has , however , started to incorporate fixed-@xmath33 constraints to the phase shift analysis , which gives a possibility to make some checks of the influence of the value of the coupling .",
    "their value for the @xmath83 coupling is @xmath91 [ 14 ] .",
    "exploratory searches were reported in [ 17,18 ] for the vpi amplitudes fa93 and sm95 .",
    "definite values for @xmath32 can not be given , because the curvature term @xmath81 has not been estimated with these amplitudes , but the linear part @xmath92 gets values of about 3 mev larger than the ones resulting from the use of the karlsruhe amplitudes when the same low - energy data sets have been used as input .",
    "another matter is that the favoured data sets would be different from the ones which are consistent with the karlsruhe amplitudes . in any case",
    ", the effect of the @xmath83 coupling seems to be relatively unimportant in comparison with the error bar due to other uncertainties .",
    "the reason could be that the @xmath32 involves the @xmath21-amplitude where the born term has been subtracted and , therefore , the large contribution directly proportional to @xmath93 is removed from the amplitude . in [ 18 ] some issues in the selection of the low - energy data was investigated for the case of vpi - sm95 [ 14 ] input amplitudes .",
    "the trend seems to be towards slightly larger values of the @xmath92 , but the effect is typically about half of the estimated total uncertainty , so the overall picture does not change essentially .",
    "new low - energy data has also appeared [ 19,20 ] .",
    "the differential cross section data of ref . [",
    "19 ] are slightly too high in energy to be suitable for the present analysis . ref .",
    "[ 20 ] gives the first analyzing power results at low energy , and with more data to come [ 21 ] an important constraint on the low - energy analysis will be obtained . a careful discussion of the @xmath70 data base has recently appeared in [ 22 ] .",
    "another piece of new information has appeared quite recently , namely , a measurement of the backward elastic @xmath69 cross section [ 23 ] as a function of energy . with the kh80 input",
    "a good fit can be found , and the result is @xmath94 .",
    "this result is quite sensitive to the amplitudes and the p@xmath68 splitting of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "even the @xmath2-waves start to matter , because the vpi - sm97 @xmath2-waves differ upto a factor of two from the ka85 results .",
    "no attempt was made to try to estimate the error bar due to the errors in data .",
    "a nice feature is , however , that the resulting scattering lengths are agreeing quite well with the results from pionic hydrogen experiment .",
    "the search gives @xmath95 to be compared with the experimental results from pionic hydrogen [ 24,25 ] @xmath96    another approach for the sigma - term discussion is gradually becoming more and more useful .",
    "namely , already now lattice calculations can make statements about the value of sigma [ 26,27 ] . using the feynman - hellmann theorem",
    "@xmath97 the sigma can be calculated from the quark mass dependence of the proton mass .",
    "of course , there are the difficulties related to the question of dynamical quarks which until now can not be treated .",
    "also , the quark mass values in actual calculations are relatively large , but gradual improvement can be expected here .",
    "the current numbers for @xmath10 are 40 - 60 mev [ 26 ] , and 50 mev [ 27 ] where the latter calculation cites a very small error ( 3 mev ) .",
    "in this workshop views were expressed that the modern @xmath83 data base is essentially internally consistent . in the strongly constrained low - energy analysis discussed here",
    "the picture is not quite that clear .",
    "also , there seems to be data sets which simply have to be `` thrown away '' in all analyses . in my opinion",
    ", one should aim at understanding from the experimental point of view why there is so much trouble with the @xmath70 data .",
    "a good example is the disagreement of the differential cross section results with the integrated cross section measurements [ 28,29 ] .",
    "another set of problems is opened by the possibility of isospin violation which has not been addressed here . the sensitivity of the extrapolation to the cheng - dashen point may call for an improvement of the precision in this respect .",
