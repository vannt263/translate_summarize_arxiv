    "the origin of fine - grained dust rims surrounding chondrules in carbonaceous chondrites is still debated .",
    "analyses of cm chondrite thin sections by optical and scanning electron microscopy ( metzler et al .",
    "1992 ) , as well as detailed theoretical models ( morfill et al .",
    "1998 , henceforth mdt ; cuzzi 2004 ; ormel et al .",
    "2008 , henceforth oct ) suggest that these dust mantles could very well have formed in the gaseous environment of the primitive solar nebula , as a result of accretion processes .",
    "nevertheless , advocates of a non - nebular origin of these rims favor their formation on the cm parent asteroids , through the impact and compaction of matrix material around chondrules ( trigo - rodrguez et al .",
    "2006 ) , followed by aqueous alteration .",
    "this interpretation arises mostly because the porosity of observed dust mantles that envelop chondrules is lower than what , presumably , could be produced by agglomeration of dust in the solar nebula .",
    "the non - nebular scenario still requires further quantitative analysis .",
    "for example , numerical techniques similar to those employed in the study of collisions between kuiper belt objects ( leinhardt and stewart 2009 ) could be used to measure shock stresses in asteroidal collisions .",
    "theoretical modeling of the formation of fine - grained dust rims assumes that two populations , chondrules and dust , both free floating in the gas of the primitive solar nebula , come into contact .",
    "mdt put forward the notion that sweep - up of dust by chondrules in a confined volume of the nebula , prior to the formation of meteorite parent bodies , reproduces the near - linear relation between chondrule radius and rim thickness ( e.g. metzler et al .",
    "1992 , paque and cuzzi 1997 ) .",
    "mdt do not make specific assumptions about the nature of the gas flow .",
    "cuzzi ( 2004 ) goes further and incorporates the role of turbulence in the sweep - up process , showing that the initial relative abundance of chondrules is an important parameter that determines both the rate at which dust is depleted locally , and the rate of growth of rimmed particles .",
    "the analytical model of cuzzi ( 2004 ) predicts that chondrule - sized particles will acquire their observed rim volumes in @xmath110@xmath710@xmath8 years , subject to the values of the dimensionless turbulent viscosity parameter @xmath9 ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 , balbus and hawley 1998 ) , which is a measure of the stresses in an accretion disk .",
    "the precise value of @xmath9 in protoplanetary disks ( including the solar nebula ) is uncertain , and authors often consider values ranging from @xmath10 to 0.1 . for disks around t tauri stars , @xmath11@xmath12 has been inferred ( hartmann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "assuming high values of @xmath9 , the cuzzi ( 2004 ) model yields chondrule rimming times as low as a few years .",
    "the effect of parametrized turbulence has been included by oct in a numerical scheme to study inter - chondrule sticking via dust rims .",
    "their monte carlo algorithm contains a detailed treatment of the collisions among porous dust grain aggregates , and their results evidently show a difference in the evolution of rimmed - chondrule size for two values of @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the lower @xmath9 value allows for rimmed - particle radii growth by a factor of 7 , compared to a factor of @xmath1 2 for @xmath15 , before the effects of dust compaction set in .",
    "this occurs in @xmath16 years in the former case , and in @xmath17 years in the latter case .",
    "the final relation between chondrule and rim masses that oct obtain is , once again , nearly linear .",
    "a key ingredient in the above calculations is the collision velocity between solid particles of different sizes . in a protoplanetary disk",
    ", the following sources of relative velocities may operate : 1 ) thermally - induced brownian motion , important for micron - sized dust grains ; 2 ) drift towards the central star and difference in azimuthal ( orbital ) velocities ( the latter also known as `` transverse '' velocity ) , both due to a radial pressure gradient in the disk gas ( e.g. weidenschilling 1977 ) ; 3 ) settling towards the disk midplane , as a result of the vertical component of the star s gravity ; and 4 ) turbulence .",
    "it was only recently that accurate analytical expressions for turbulent relative velocities were obtained ( ormel and cuzzi 2007 ) .",
    "these formulae show that turbulence can dominate mutual velocities for chondrule- and smaller - size particles in the solar nebula at 3 au , over systematic radial drift , provided @xmath18 ( oct , their figure 1 ) .",
    "our understanding of the evolution of protoplanetary disks is significantly improved when their vertical structure is taken into account .",
    "for example , numerical simulations show that the gas velocity dispersion ( fromang and papaloizou 2006 ) , viscous stress ( turner et al .",
    "2007 ) , and accretion rate ( turner et al . 2010 ) depend on height @xmath19 above the disk midplane . furthermore , this vertical dependence bears directly on the dynamical behavior of solid bodies .",
    "for instance , the increase of gas velocities at high @xmath19 ( where gas densities are lower ) produce higher particle relative velocities .",
    "while it is recognized that protoplanetary disks must be in a turbulent state , there is no general consensus regarding the mechanism responsible for the production of turbulence .",
    "however , workers in the field acknowledge that a magnetic field , coupled to the differential rotation of the disk gas , could be the crucial driver of disk turbulence . the outcome of the ensuing magnetorotational instability ( or mri ; balbus and hawley 1998 ) is self - sustained turbulence that supplies the necessary viscous stresses for the disk angular momentum to be transported outwards .",
    "hydrodynamic and magnetic stresses ( the latter greater than the former by a factor of a few ) both contribute to the turbulent viscosity in a disk .    there is a caveat associated with the saturation of the mri in the solar nebula : gas ionization may be too low , and electrical resistivity too high , in dense regions of the nebula to allow coupling of the gas to the magnetic field .",
    "these regions remain nearly laminar and are sandwiched between conducting layers where turbulence does develop , owing to ionization by cosmic rays and stellar x - rays that are absorbed before they reach the midplane .",
    "furthermore , recombination of free electrons on micron - sized dust grains is efficient and reduces the ionization fraction below that necessary to sustain turbulence ( turner et al . 2010 ) .",
    "dust abundance is therefore important in establishing levels of turbulent activity .    notwithstanding",
    "the significance of gas resistivity , in this study it is set to zero to focus on the growth of rimmed , chondrule - sized solid particles as they accrete dust in a local neighborhood of the solar nebula , in which all of the gas flow is turbulent due to the mri and the turbulent intensity varies with time and position .",
    "the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical set - up used allows us not only to determine the final size distribution of dust - mantled objects , but in the process it performs a self - consistent calculation of the dust abundance as a function of time and spatial location , with turbulence and vertical settling as the sources of relative velocities between dust and chondrules .",
    "section 2 presents a semi - analytical argument regarding the importance of turbulence in dust - chondrule dynamics .",
    "section 3 describes the numerical technique used to model the solar nebula and the solids , including the interaction between chondrules and dust .",
    "this section also lists the simulations that were carried out .",
    "section 4 presents the results of the mhd calculations , and a discusion follows in section 5 .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "for a minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model , one can compute the magnitudes of the particle relative velocities as the aerodynamic coupling of the solids to the gas changes , due to the decreasing gas density with height .",
    "figure 1 plots the magnitudes of relative velocities between a 1-mm particle ( a typical chondrule size ) , and a 1-@xmath20 m grain , at 3 au , due to turbulence ( _ black solid curve _ ) , vertical settling ( _ dark gray solid curve _ ) and radial drift ( _ light gray solid curve _ ) as a function of @xmath19 ( normalized by the disk scale height @xmath21 ) .",

    "ciesla ( 2009 ) found that the concentration of 500-@xmath20 m particles has a maximum at @xmath110 au in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk with a mass accretion rate corresponding to that of a t tauri system , @xmath117 yr@xmath88 .",
    "this maximum is 57% greater than the abundance at 3 au , and it comes about as a result of the radial transport of material in a @xmath118-year old disk . although the timescales for dust rimming of chondrules are significantly shorter than global transport of sub - millimeter particles ( and likely also shorter than transport of millimeter - sized particles ) , the end result of solid matter transfer between the inner and outer regions of the solar nebula may alter the chondrule abundance at the orbital radius of interest .",
    "oct calculate the evolution of dust density as porous aggregates accrete onto chondrules , for their two nominal values of @xmath9 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( their fig .",
    "6 ) . in their numerical model",
    ", @xmath76 decreases to 0.1% of its initial value in @xmath13000 ( @xmath119 ) and 1000 ( @xmath15 ) years .",
    "while such long times may seem at odds with the collision time scales mentioned in section [ sec : constq ] , it is important to bear in mind that the low values of @xmath120 originate from the high relative velocities imparted by mri turbulence , which oct do not model . in our simulations , with @xmath9 between 3.5@xmath121 and 2@xmath122 ( fig .",
    "1 ) being a function of position and time , long depletion times of @xmath1 1000 years occur only for very low chondrule abundance , run a ( fig .",
    "run d depletes dust to @xmath123 in 400 years .",
    "clearly , @xmath9 plays a significant role in how much dust is available for chondrule rim growth .",
    "in fact , rapid growth can be understood by considering the dependence on @xmath9 of the relative velocity @xmath3 between particles and gas [ a proxy for the relative velocity between particles and dust in eq .",
    "( 7 ) ] , @xmath124 ( oct )",
    ".    the importance of @xmath9 will become more evident in calculations that allow for the development of a disk dead zone , the nearly - laminar region of low viscous stresses mentioned in section 1 that results from non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "the degree of coupling of magnetic fields to the disk gas will determine whether the flow is susceptible to the mri .",
    "magnetically - active regions , which are ionized by stellar x - rays or interstellar cosmic rays , will be in a turbulent state , whereas dense zones in which recombination processes are fast , such as the disk interior , will be quiescent . however , minimum - mass solar nebula models with time - dependent gas ionization chemistry ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "2007 ) show that ionized gas can reach the disk interior through turbulent mixing and , under certain conditions , this will allow a weak coupling to magnetic fields and an increase in turbulent intensity .",
    "the assumption of a wholly turbulent disk used in this work relies on such results , as well as on the fact that electron fractions as low as @xmath125 can render the flow unstable to the mri ( balbus 2009 ) . in any case",
    ", a marked vertical gradient of turbulent activity is expected at some point .",
    "variable - ohmic - resistivity calculations by turner et al .",
    "( 2007 ) yield mean magnetic stresses that are 20 times larger in the upper layers than at the midplane , at an orbital radius of 1 au .",
    "a variation by a factor of 100 is found at 5 au .",
    "the original computations of dead zone evolution in a shearing box ( fleming and stone 2003 ) obtained @xmath126 at the midplane and @xmath127 at heights @xmath128=2@xmath21 .",
    "based on these figures , the work of oct is likely to describe conditions inside a solar nebula dead zone , which may have a limited lifetime . increasing turbulent activity that originates at the top and bottom layers of the nebula can augment @xmath9 close to the midplane by a factor of @xmath1 37 ( turner et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the well - documented linear relation between dust rim thickness and chondrule radius is evident at the end of run d ( fig .",
    "9 , _ black circles _ ) and e ( _ asterisks _ and _ squares _ , which correspond to miplane and upper - layer chondrules , respectively ) .",
    "data from disaggregated rimmed chondrules in cv chondrites ( paque & cuzzi 1997 , _ triangles _ ) are shown for comparison .",
    "the straight line has a slope of unity .",
    "the scatter in the disaggregation data reflects the range of values that can be measured in real chondrites .",
    "the linear trend derived from runs d and e would need to be verified , once again , with the inclusion of shattering processes that may produce a realistic scatter of rim thicknesses .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that trigo - rodrguez et al . (",
    "2006 ) found only a modest correlation between dust rim thickness and size of the enclosed core in cm chondrites .",
    "the separation of chondrules into two distinct populations in run e , according to their initial vertical position @xmath19 ( 0 or 2.3@xmath21 ) , served the purpose of making a dynamical comparison between chondrules formed in the disk interior and those that could have been dumped in the upper layers after an x - wind carried them from the nebular x region .",
    "however , the very formation of chondrules at the x point has been called into question due to dynamical and thermal inconsistencies within the x - wind model ( desch et al .",
    "it is therefore important to bear in mind that a population of dust - rimming chondrules deposited high up in the solar nebula may not come about easily .",
    "in this work , accretion of dust by chondrule - sized particles is modeled using a mhd representation of a turbulent solar nebula .",
    "mhd processes are a viable mechanism to produce and sustain turbulent viscosity in protoplanetary disks , and the dynamical evolution of the ionized gas in the solar nebula must depend crucially on its ability to couple to different magnetic field configurations .",
    "relative velocities between chondrules and micron - sized dust grains can be excited by several sources , and here we focused on the effect imparted by mri turbulence and vertical settling due to stellar gravity , in a local neighborhood of the nebula .",
    "an important parameter in determining the rate of depletion of dust due to sweep - up by chondrules is the latter s volume density .",
    "the mhd simulations show that chondrules accrete dust mostly within @xmath1 1 scale - height ( @xmath21 ) of the nebula midplane , since the growth of dust rims decreases aerodynamic coupling of particles to the gas , and increases their response to vertical gravity .",
    "time scales to deplete dust to 1% of its initial abundance vary from 10 to @xmath1 800 years , roughly the same times in which chondrules reach their mass - averaged , asymptotic radius .",
    "if the sticking efficiency of dust to chondrules is below @xmath12 , the growth time scale could be @xmath16 years .",
    "low sticking eficiencies ( i.e. , very little dust rim growth ) can be common due to very high , mri  driven , turbulent relative velocities between chondrules and dust .",
    "vertical stratification of the nebular gas density allows to compare the dust rimming process at different nebula heights , and this has been done by initially placing one chondrule population at the nebula midplane and another population at a height of 2.3@xmath21 .",
    "the growth rate of dust rims in these two cases is very similar , at least for the first 300 years of evolution , with the midplane population having a mass  averaged radius @xmath1 1 % larger than the upper layer population during the course of the numerical run .",
    "size distributions of rimmed chondrules obtained from the mhd simulations could be used for comparison with data from actual chondrites .",
    "the aerodynamic properties of chondrules suspended in nebular gas are reasonably well understood , and such comparison would provide further insight into the mhd conditions in the primitive solar nebula . in particular , the level of turbulence , and hence the ionization state of the gas , could be constrained .",
    "sweep - up of dust by chondrules is likely to influence the evolution of a laminar dead zone in the solar nebula .",
    "future mhd calculations should incorporate explicit ionization processes ( such as those due to stellar x - rays and radionuclide decay ) to obtain a more complete , layered flow structure in which chondrule rimming at different locations can be characterized .",
    "the vertical variation of turbulent intensity and dust abundance leads to a modest dependence of rimmed - chondrule size on disk height .",
    "whether this variation could be imprinted and identified on the meteoritic record will require further analysis to account for processes such as fragmentation and compaction of dust structures .",
    "compaction of initially fractal dust aggregates can result from collisions , and compact dust rims can play a role in the sticking between rimmed chondrules .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) methods ( oct , zsom and dullemond 2008 ) provide a robust procedure to investigate coagulation of chondrule compounds , since they treat interactions _ between _ dust",
    " rimmed chondrules , providing an extension to the present work .",
    "these codes take as one of their inputs particle  particle relative velocities @xmath51 , which could be taken directly from a mhd simulation ( e.g. , by measuring @xmath51 between lagrangian particles located inside an eulerian grid cell , as in carballido et al .",
    "although a mc code does not resolve the spatial structure of the protoplanetary disk , it contains all the physics of particle  particle collisions . on the other hand",
    ", the mhd run provides the spatial structure of the nebula plus position ",
    "dependent relative velocities , which can be plugged back into the mc code to provide self ",
    "consistency to rimmed chondrule  chondrule collisions .",
    "furthermore , if non ",
    "ideal mhd effects are allowed for ( e.g. , a dead zone ) , the growth of chondrule compounds in both turbulent and nearly laminar regions could be characterized and related to the time and space  dependent ionization state of the gas , which may be useful in chemical studies of chondrule compounds .",
    "the use of larger shearing boxes now allows to study locations of protoplanetary disks that reach up to 30 scale heights in radial extent ( stone and gardiner 2010 ) .",
    "thus , in addition to turbulence and vertical settling , the contribution of radial drift to relative velocities between chondrules and dust could be incorporated self - consistently in a mhd - monte carlo numerical scheme .",
    "the combination of these two techniques is likely to set the nebular origin of dust mantles on a stronger footing .",
