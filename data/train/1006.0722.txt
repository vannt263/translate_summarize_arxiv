    "the study of the birational geometry of the moduli spaces has become a very active research area after the unexpected result of harris - mumford - eisenbud ( @xcite , @xcite ) that the moduli space @xmath4 of curves of genus @xmath2 is a variety of general type for @xmath5 , contradicting a long - standing conjecture of severi on the unirationality of moduli of curves .",
    "more recently , also the birational geometry of other moduli spaces has been widely investigated : the moduli space of pointed curves ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the moduli space of prym varieties ( @xcite ) , the moduli space of spin curves ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , to mention at least some contributions in this area .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the birational geometry of the universal picard variety @xmath6 parameterizing smooth curves of genus @xmath2 together with a line bundle of degree @xmath1 .",
    "the following result is due to verra ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "( @xcite)_[ver - thm ] the variety @xmath7 is unirational for @xmath8 and any @xmath1 .",
    "our main result is the computation of the kodaira dimension of @xmath7 with @xmath9 under a technical assumption on the degree @xmath1 .",
    "recall that , since @xmath7 is singular and not projective , the kodaira dimension of @xmath7 , which we denote by @xmath10 , is defined as the kodaira dimension of any smooth projective model of it ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "1.3.6 ) ) of @xmath0 in the non - trivial cases , namely for @xmath13 . without any assumption on the degree @xmath1 ,",
    "we obtain the following partial result :    [ kod - nongeo ] the kodaira dimension of @xmath0 ( for @xmath9 ) satisfies the following inequalities @xmath14 moreover , @xmath15 if @xmath16 ( and in particular for @xmath17 ) .",
    "let us now explain the strategy that we use to prove the above results .",
    "the main tool we use is the git compactification constructed by caporaso ( see @xcite ) @xmath18 of @xmath7 over the deligne - mumford moduli space @xmath19 of stable curves of genus @xmath2 .",
    "the projective normal variety @xmath20 is a good moduli space for the stack @xmath21 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , whose section over a scheme @xmath22 is the groupoid @xmath23 of families of quasistable curves of genus @xmath2 @xmath24 endowed with a balanced line bundle @xmath25 of degree @xmath1 ( see [ def - stack - scheme ] for details ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath20 is a coarse moduli scheme for @xmath21 if and only if @xmath3 , which is precisely the numerical hypothesis on the degree @xmath1 in theorem [ kod - geom ] .",

    "in particular , if @xmath27 is a resolution of singularities of @xmath20 , then every pluricanonical form defined on the smooth locus @xmath28 of @xmath20 extends holomorphically to @xmath27 , that is , for all integers @xmath29 we have @xmath30    the proof of this theorem is given in section [ sec - sing ] .",

    "note that this is in contrast with what happens for @xmath19 ( or for the moduli space of prym or spin curves ) , where the pull - back of the canonical class of the coarse moduli space is equal to the canonical class of the moduli stack plus some ( small ) corrections at the boundary .",
    "theorem [ k ] allows us to compute the iitaka dimension of @xmath33 as the iitaka dimension of the divisor @xmath38 on @xmath19 ( because @xmath39 is a regular fibration ) . by exploiting the rich available knowledge on the birational geometry of @xmath19",

    "the second part of theorem [ kod - nongeo ] follows from proposition [ kod - fib ] , which is proved in section [ fibrat ] via a careful analysis of the regular fibration @xmath42 .    in the final section [ bir - pdg ] , inspired by lemma 8.1 in @xcite , we investigate for which values of @xmath1 and @xmath43 the varieties @xmath7 and @xmath44 are birational .",
