    "the phase structure of qcd at high temperature @xmath0 and/or quark chemical potential @xmath1 has attracted a great deal of interest in cosmology , compact stars and heavy - ion collisions . during the last decades , significant advances have been made in our understandings of the phase structure of hot and/or dense quark matter . at the present time",
    ", it is widely accepted that the qcd vacuum undergoes a phase transition ( into a chirally symmetric phase or a color - superconducting phase ) at sufficiently high @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the studies of the phase structure of qcd so far have been exclusively devoted to homogeneous quark matter in bulk .",
    "however , the qgp phase created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has a finite size and it is not obvious that the size is large enough to allow to apply the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if the size of the system of interest is not large enough , we need to take account of the deviations from thermodynamic calculations .",
    "for instance , the fluctuations of order parameter , induced by the finite - size effects , would lower the critical temperature and change the order of phase transition .",
    "there are many works which concern with finite - size effects on hadron physics ; lattice qcd calculations fuku1,fuku2,bail , gopie , qcdsf , koma , orht , ss , the finite - size scaling analyses @xcite , plasmon @xcite , baryon number fluctuations @xcite , and so on tho , davi , mus , rischke , kim , zak1,zak2,sto , amore1,he , kogut , wong , fraga .",
    "in particular , the finite - size effects on the qcd phase diagram are studied in @xcite and @xcite . in the former ,",
    "however , the discussion is limited to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional systems and in the latter , the phase transition discussed is not related directly with the manifestation of chiral symmetry .    in this paper , we discuss the finite - size effects to the chiral phase transition . for the purpose of illustrating our approach , we adopt the two - flavor nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model as an effective model of qcd .",
    "the finite - size effects are taken into account by using the multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) @xcite .",
    "then , we study the size dependence of the thermodynamic potential in the mean - field approximation .    in the mre approximation , the finite - size effects",
    "are included in terms of the modified density of states .",
    "the mre has been used to calculate the thermodynamic quantities ( such as the energy per baryon and the free energy ) of finite lumps of quark matter @xcite . as far as overall structures are concerned , the results are in good agreement with those of the mode - filling calculations with the mit bag wave functions .",
    "we emphasize that our model calculation differs from the finite - size scaling analyses ( in which finite - size effects act as an external field ; more specifically , mass ) and the studies in a finite box in that the present model is essentially based on the mit bag wave functions .",
    "however , it should be noted that the relevance of the mre approximation is still inconclusive when it is applied to nonperturbative calculations @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we apply the mre approximation to the njl model and calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase diagram . however , the result is unacceptable because the order of chiral phase transition is changed from second to first . in section 3 ,",
    "we reconsider the application of the mre to the chiral phase transition .",
    "summary and concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "we consider up and down quarks to be massless and start with the following @xmath2 symmetric njl lagrangian , @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the quark field with two flavors @xmath5 and three colors @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the coupling constant .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath8 act in the flavor space .",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath9 gev and the coupling constant @xmath10 are determined so as to reproduce the pion decay constant @xmath11 mev and the chiral condensate @xmath12 in the chiral limit @xcite .    in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential per unit volume @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 \\left[1 + e^{-\\beta(e_k - \\mu)}\\right ] \\right\\ } ,   \\label{eqn : tdp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the dynamically generated quark mass .",
    "the density of states @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    now we consider a quark matter confined in a given sphere that is embedded in the hadronic vacuum and do not impose the pressure balance condition between interior of the sphere and external vacuum .",
    "we would rather fix the radius of the sphere and examine the phase diagram . to incorporate finite - size effects into the thermodynamic potential",
    ", we replace the density of states @xmath21 with the mre density of states @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,   \\label{eqn : mre}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the radius of the sphere and the functions , @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] correspond respectively to the surface and the curvature contributions to the fermionic density of states .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mre ] ) should be identified with the mass of quarks in the interior of the sphere .",
    "it should be also noted that the precise expression of the function @xmath27 has not been derived within the mre framework .",
    "here we used the assumption proposed in ref .",
    "we show the momentum dependence of the mre density of states in fig .",
    "one can see that the mre density of states is suppressed by the finite - size effects and the suppression is more pronounced at low momenta .",
    "it can also be seen that the mre density of states takes unphysical negative values at low momenta because of the neglect of the higher order terms in @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we shall introduce the infrared cutoff @xmath29 that is defined by the largest zero of @xmath30 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , within the mre approximation , the thermodynamic potential including the finite - size effects is expressed as follows , @xmath31 \\left[1 + e^{-\\beta(e_k - \\mu)}\\right ] \\right\\}.   \\label{eqn : tdp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to obtain the phase diagram we minimize eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tdp2 ] ) with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "when the value of @xmath26 at the minimum is zero , the system is in the chiral symmetric phase ( qgp ) and if the value of @xmath26 is not zero , the system is in the broken symmetry phase ( hadronic ) .",
    "we then find the phase diagram given in fig .",
    "the outermost curve corresponds to @xmath32 ( thermodynamical limit ) . in this limit , of course our approach recovers the known results@xcite .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition is second order at small chemical potential and as the chemical potential increases , the order of the phase transition is changed form second to first at the tricritical point . in this curve",
    "the parts corresponding to the second order and the first order transitions are indicated by the dotted and solid lines , respectively .    to see the effect of finite size in this approach",
    ", we show the critical temperature lines for @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 fm ( from outside to inside ) .",
    "one can see that the critical temperatures are lowered as @xmath24 is decreased .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the enhancement of large fluctuations induced by the finite - size effects .",
    "however , we note that the tricritical point which exists at @xmath32 disappears for all finite values of @xmath37 at any value of chemical potential , the order of phase transition becomes the first one and the second order phase transition disappears .",
    "this is because , as we will see below , the mre can not describe the second order phase transition .",
    "these results obtained by the simple application of the mre to the thermodynamic potential are physically unreasonable for the following reasons .",
    "first , the reduction of the critical temperature seems to be too strong .",
    "second , more critical one from physical point of view , is the disappearance of the second order phase transition . in general , large fluctuations of the order parameter could increase the order of the phase transition , for instance , from first to second .",
    "therefore , it is unnatural that the second order phase transition was converted to the first order one .",
    "this unphysical behavior indicates the necessity of some modification of the present simple application of the mre to the njl model .    to clarify the problem mentioned above ,",
    "let us take a closer look on the self - consistency condition ( scc ) including the mre density of states .",
    "the derivative of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath26 is given by @xmath39 \\left [ 1+e^{-\\beta ( e_{k}-\\mu ) } \\right ] \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\nu \\int_{\\lambda _ { \\mbox{\\scriptsize ir}}}^{\\lambda _ { \\mbox{\\scriptsize uv}}}dk\\rho _ { \\mbox{\\scriptsize mre}}\\frac{m}{e_{k}}\\left [ 1-\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta ( e_{k}+\\mu ) } + 1}-\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta ( e_{k}-\\mu ) } + 1}\\right ] \\label{eqn : mscc}\\end{aligned}\\]][the term proportional to @xmath40 vanishes by virtue of @xmath41 .",
    "for the second order phase transition to exist , it is necessary that this derivative vanishes at @xmath42 however , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath43 is not the solution to the scc because of @xmath44 so that @xmath45 except for @xmath46 that is , the thermodynamic potential has always positive gradient at @xmath43 , hence the thermodynamic potential ( [ eqn : tdp2 ] ) can not describe the second order phase transition . in fig . [ fig3 ] , the thermodynamic potential at @xmath47 mev is plotted as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath32 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 fm .",
    "in the proceeding section , we examined the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase diagram , looking for the minimum of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "this sort of the application of the mre density of states has been employed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the second order phase transition suddenly disappears soon after taking the finite - size effect into account .",
    "thus , the phase diagram with finite size does not converge to that with infinite size even if the radius @xmath24 is increased .",
    "it follows that we can not take the thermodynamic limit in the mre approximation .",
    "moreover , fluctuations due to the finite - size effects is expected to change the order of phase transition from first to second .",
    "hence , it is unacceptable that the finite size effect is taken account of the mre approximation employed in the proceeding section . in this section ,",
    "we reconsider the application of the mre to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the reason why the second order chiral phase transition disappeared in the previous section is the nonexistence of the trivial solution to the scc .",
    "the disappearance is due to the mass dependence contained in the mre density of states which prevents the disappearance of the second order phase transition is due to the mass dependence contained in the mre density of states .",
    "as is shown in the last of the proceeding section , the scc does not have the trivial solution because of the mass dependence .",
    "however , there can be another scenario for the application of the mre .",
    "according to the paper by bailin and bloch@xcite , the parameter contained in the mre density of states is not the mass of particle inside the cavities but a parameter which characterizes the penetration of the wave function of the quark matter confined in a finite volume into the hadronic environment . in the following ,",
    "we impose specific boundary conditions on quarks and study the cases in which the mre density of states does not depend on the dynamical quark mass . in this scenario ,",
    "the mass parameter contained in the mre density of states is replaced by the parameter @xmath50 which is generally independent of the dynamical quark mass .",
    "then , the scc is given by @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we do not have the derivative term of the mre density of states and the scc obviously has the trivial solution .",
    "for instance , let us consider the dirichlet boundary condition by setting @xmath52@xcite .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath53and the infrared cutoff is given by @xmath54    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the corresponding phase diagram . the solid and dotted lines represents the critical lines of the first order and second order phase transitions , respectively .",
    "these lines represent the critical lines of ( a ) @xmath32 , ( b ) @xmath48 , ( c ) @xmath49 and ( d ) @xmath55 fm from the out - most one , respectively . compared to the proceeding result",
    ", the finite - size effects are suppressed .",
    "the dashed line represents the trajectory of the tricritical point as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "one can easily see that the temperature and the chemical potential of the tricritical point are reduced as the @xmath24 is decreased .",
    "finally , the tricritical point disappears at @xmath56 fm and hence the region of the first order phase transition vanishes .",
    "it should be noted that the phase diagram calculated with the mre density of states converges to that in the infinite size in the limit of @xmath57 , and is consistent with the fact of the increase of fluctuations due to the finite size effects .",
    "thus , this approach seems to be more plausible than the proceeding approximation .",
    "note that even the second order phase transition disappears at the radius smaller than @xmath58 fm .",
    "this is because of the existence of the infrared cutoff and we will find the phase transition at smaller @xmath24 by taking account of the higher order terms of the mre density of state .",
    "if this boundary condition is applicable for the real physical situation created in relativistic heavy ion collisions , then the equation of state of the matter changes with the expansion of the system . at the early stage of creation of the hot matter at the center ,",
    "the system size is the order of @xmath59 fm and the critical temperature at @xmath60 is around @xmath61 mev , but after the system expands and reaches the hadronic freezeout stage , then the system size is much larger and the critical temperature almost recovers the thermodynamical limit .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamical description of such a situation requires an equation of state which reflects the above finite - size effect .",
    "the physical environment consistent with the mit bag model is considered to be realized by setting the neumann boundary condition , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the infrared cut off is @xmath64    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show the corresponding phase diagram .",
    "the lines correspond to the critical lines for the cases of ( a ) @xmath65 , ( b ) @xmath48 , ( c ) @xmath49 , ( d ) @xmath66 and ( e ) @xmath67 fm from the out - most one , respectively .",
    "the finite - size effects are more suppressed , because the surface term vanishes in this boundary condition , and hence the difference of the critical lines between @xmath65 and @xmath68 fm in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is negligible .",
    "the remarkable reduction of the critical temperature is observed at smaller size than @xmath69 fm .",
    "the trajectory of the tricritical point denoted by the dashed line changes steeper than the case of the dirichlet boundary condition . in this boundary condition , the tricritical point vanishes at @xmath70 fm and the second order phase transition disappears at the radius smaller than @xmath71 fm .",
    "contrary to the previous case , results from this boundary condition indicate that the finite size system with @xmath68 fm is large enough to take the thermodynamic limit . in this case",
    ", it will be reasonable to apply the usual equation of state which is given by the thermodynamical limit in hydrodynamical models to describe the heavy - ion collision processes .",
    "so far , we have discussed the behavior of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "however , it is not easy to see how the second order phase transition is affected by the finite - size effects .",
    "for the purpose of looking at characteristic changes of the second order transition , we calculate the specific heat defined by @xmath72 note that the specific heat shows discontinuity at the critical point of the second order phase transition .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the specific heat of the systems for the cases of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . here , we chose @xmath75 gev for a common quark chemical potential and examined the cases of @xmath76 fm and @xmath77 fm . in both cases , the specific heats jump at the corresponding critical temperatures .",
    "the jump of the specific heat still exists after including the finite - size effects .",
    "the result indicates that the second order phase transitions remain second order .",
    "however , the gap of the specific heat is decreased by the finite - size effects .",
    "in this paper , wee have discussed the finite - size effects on the chiral phase transition in qcd in the context of the two - flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model in the mean - field approximation . to incorporate finite - size effects into the thermodynamic potential",
    ", we employed the multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) , where finite - size effects are included by the modification of the density of state .",
    "we applied the mre approximation in different two ways .",
    "one is that the mass  parameter contained in the mre density of state is identified as the dynamical quark mass as is done in @xcite . in this case",
    "it is shown that only the first order phase transition can take place for any finite size and the critical point disappears .",
    "the other is that we identify the massparameter as the inverse of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function at the surface , following the discussion by balian and bloch@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the situation that our system is confined in a finite volume by an external potential and the boundary condition is fixed independently from the order parameter of the system .. then , the order of chiral phase transition changes from the second to the first as the chemical potential increases .",
    "the temperature and the chemical potential of at the critical point become smaller as the system size decreases .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that fluctuations is enhanced by the finite - size effects .",
    "however , quantitatively , we found that the two extreme boundary conditions lead to substantially different results .",
    "for the dirichlet boundary condition , the finite - size effect is still large . if this is the case , the critical temperature changes from @xmath78 mev to @xmath79 mev at zero chemical potential if the size of the system expands from @xmath49 fm to @xmath35 fm .",
    "such effects should reflect on the hydrodynamical collective observables , i.e. , the @xmath80 . on the other hand , for the neumann boundary condition ,",
    "the finite - size effects are not so visible and the equation of state is almost the same as that obtained from the thermodynamical limit .",
    "it should be noted that the mre calculation will lose its validity when the size of our system is very small since we have ignored the higher order terms of the mre approximation .",
    "moreover , the finite - size effects considered in the mre approximation is only the reduction of the density of state .",
    "however , in general , we can expect other influences due to the finite - size effects ; for example , the energy eigenvalue of particles will be also affected .",
    "we calculated the thermodynamic potential in the mean - field approximation , although it is known that large fluctuations near phase transitions invalidate the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , the qcd critical temperature in the mean - field approximation is qualitatively coincide with that of the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "thus , the results obtained in this work would be still qualitatively reliable , unless the fluctuations are extraordinary enhanced by the finite - size effects .    finally , we comment on the outlook for future studies . in this paper",
    ", we studied the static behavior of chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the finite - size effects would also affect the dynamical behaviors .",
    "for instance , the life time of fluctuations near phase transitions increases because of the critical slowing down ( csd)@xcite . the csd is due to the large fluctuations , and hence the finite - size effects will enhance the csd ."
