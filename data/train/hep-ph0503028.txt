    "@xcite recently discussed the possibility that mass varying neutrinos ( mavans ) can behave as a negative pressure fluid which contributes to the origin of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "in particular the authors consider a scenario in which the neutrino mass arises from the interaction with a scalar field , the acceleron @xmath1 , whose effective potential changes as a function of the neutrino density .",
    "this establishes a very intriguing connection between two recent pieces of evidence for new physics the indirect observation of dark energy and the confirmation of neutrino masses and oscillations that are both suggestively characterized by a similar mass scale . besides the possible interesting cosmological effects  @xcite",
    ", from the point of view of neutrino oscillation phenomenology the unavoidable consequence of this scenario is that the neutrino mass depends on the local neutrino density and therefore can be different in media with high neutrino densities such as the sun .    a subsequent work ref .",
    "@xcite also investigated the possibility that neutrino masses depend on the visible matter density as well .",
    "such a dependence would be induced by non - renormalizable operators which would couple the acceleron also to the visible matter and could lead to interesting phenomenological consequences for neutrino oscillations  @xcite . however , unlike the dependence on the local neutrino density , which is an unavoidable consequence of the proposed mavans mechanism , the possible dependence on the visible matter density is strongly model - dependent . in principle",
    "it could be vanishingly small since so far the only information on the effective acceleron - matter couplings are upper bounds from tests on the gravitational inverse square law .",
    "consequently , in this work we concentrate on the phenomenological consequences associated to the unavoidable dependence of mavans on the neutrino density in the sun .",
    "we find that a generic feature of these scenarios is that they establish a connection between the effective @xmath0 in the sun and the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath2 . due to this effect",
    ", the description of solar neutrino data worsens for large @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , a lower bound on the level of degeneracy @xmath3 can be derived from the combined analysis of the solar  @xcite and kamland data  @xcite .",
    "for the realization considered in this work , the 3@xmath4 bound is @xmath5 from the analysis of solar plus kamland data . in particular",
    "this implies that these scenarios favour normal mass orderings as for inverse mass orderings @xmath6 ev@xmath7 which already implies @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , the constraint on @xmath2 will allow a test of the validity of these scenarios in the event of a positive determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale from independent means .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] we evaluate the density profile of neutrinos in the sun in the ssm and discuss the results on the expected size of the neutrino mass shift induced for different forms of the scalar potential .",

    "[ sec : analysis ] we illustrate the generic quantitative consequences of these scenarios by presenting the results of an analysis of solar ( plus kamland ) data for a particular realization .",
    "for most purposes in this section , the derivation of the effective neutrino mass in the presence of the solar neutrino background can be made in a model independent way using the neutrino mass @xmath9 as the dynamical field ( without making explicit use of the dependence of @xmath9 on the acceleron field @xmath10 ) .    in this approach at low energies",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath9 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 contains the contribution to the energy density both from the neutrinos as well as from the scalar potential .",

    "the worsening is driven by two main effects .",
    "first , the increase of the survival probability of @xmath33b neutrinos makes more difficult to accommodate the observed cc / nc ratio ( and cc / es ) at sno . in principle the cc rate could be cured by the free @xmath33b flux @xmath124 , but the nc constrains the allowed values of @xmath124 .",
    "second , shifting to lower values of @xmath134 increases the expected day - night asymmetry .",
    "this eventually makes the agreement with the data impossible for high enough values of @xmath2 since the neutrino density in the earth is too small to induce any additional effect on the day - night asymmetry .",
    "consequently , we find that the 3-dimensional region at 3@xmath4 extends only to @xmath136 ev .",
    "it is clear from these results , that the fit for large values of @xmath2 will become worse after combination with the kamland data . in the present framework",
    "the analysis of kamland only depends on the `` vacuum '' parameters @xmath134 and @xmath137 .",
    "we include here the results of a likelihood analysis to the unbinned kamland data  @xcite .",
    "details of this analysis will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we show in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] the result of the combined analysis of solar plus kamland .",
    "the global minimum is obtained for the totally hierarchical case @xmath107 ev and @xmath138 ev@xmath7 , @xmath121 and @xmath139 . as seen in the figure",
    "as @xmath2 increases the allowed region becomes smaller . as a matter of fact , due to the shift of the solar region to lower values of @xmath134 , the local best fit point of the combined analysis moves to the lma0 region  @xcite for `` intermediate '' values of @xmath140 ev .",
    "in other words , for those values , lma0 becomes less disfavoured than in the hierarchical case .",
    "for example for @xmath107 the lma0 region lies at @xmath141 , which implies that it would be part of the 3-dim allowed region at 5.5@xmath4 , while for @xmath142 ev the lma0 region lies at @xmath143 and it would be part of the 3-dim region at allowed at 3.15@xmath4 .",
    "the result of the previous discussion is that generically mavan s imply that the description of solar data worsens with the degree of degeneracy of the neutrinos . in order to quantify this statement in the present scenario ,",
    "we define the `` degeneracy parameter '' , @xmath144 , and study the dependence of @xmath145 on this parameter after marginalization over all others : @xmath146      in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg ] we plot @xmath148 . within the present bounds on the absolute neutrino mass",
    "@xcite , @xmath149 .",
    "as discussed above , we find that for the considered scenario of mavan s , the best fit occurs for hierarchical neutrinos @xmath150 while the fit becomes worse as the neutrinos become more degenerate .",
    "as seen in the figure , the curve for the solar plus kamland analysis is not monotonic but presents a secondary minimum around @xmath151 .",
    "this is due to the migration of the local best fit point to the lma0 region for values of @xmath140 ev .",
    "quantitatively , we find the lower bound at 3@xmath4 : @xmath152 from the analysis of solar ( solar plus kamland ) data .",
    "in particular , this bound implies that in this scenario inverted mass ordering is disfavoured since in this case @xmath6 ev@xmath7 which implies @xmath153 .",
    "finally we want to comment on the possible model - dependence of these results . as discussed in the previous sections",
    "there are two main sources of arbitrariness in our derivations : the choice of the functional form of the scalar potential , and the assumption that all neutrinos acquire an independent contribution to their mass via the couplings to the dark sector with no generation mixing .    as shown in our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] the choice of the potential may affect the exact form of the equation relating @xmath134 to @xmath154 but it will not alter the fact that @xmath154 grows with the neutrino mass scale .",
    "in particular choosing a power law potential with a small fractionally power @xmath155 yields the same results while the results for an inverse exponential potential are very similar but for a slightly higher value of @xmath2 .    concerning the assumption of no generation mixing from the dark sector contribution to the neutrino mass ,",
    "its effect can be understood as follows . in general , if the couplings to the dark sector are not `` mass  diagonal '' they will induce an additional source of rotation between the flavour eigenstates and the effective mass eigenstates .",
    "this would imply that the mixing angle in eq.([eq : deltam ] ) would not be @xmath156 but some @xmath157 .",
    "in general the qualitative features of the results will still be valid although the quantitative bounds will obviously vary .",
    "in particular , the bounds will become tighter if the mixing could be such that the mass eigenstates were inverted ( @xmath158 ) .    a possible exception to this general argument would be the special case in which the flavour structure of the potential is such that @xmath159 without a substantial modification of @xmath160 . in this case the @xmath161 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltam ] ) would be suppressed and the shift on @xmath162 would be small even for @xmath163 ev .",
    "this would imply @xmath164 , this effect being mostly relevant for neutrinos which are produced nearer the center of the sun . as a consequence",
    "the survival probability for @xmath28b neutrinos can be slightly lower and a slightly better fit to the data could be achieved .    summarizing , in this work",
    "we have studied the phenomenological consequences of the dependence of mavans on the neutrino density in the sun .",
    "we have evaluated the density profile of neutrinos in the sun in the ssm and the expected size of the neutrino mass shift induced for different forms of the scalar potential .",
    "we find that generically these scenarios establish a connection between the effective mass splitting in the sun and the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "we have analyzed the quantitative consequences of this effect , by performing a global analysis to solar and kamland data for a particular realization of this mechanism .",
    "our results show that the description of solar neutrino data worsens for large neutrino mass scale and an upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale can be derived .",
    "equivalently , we derive a lower bound on the level of degeneracy @xmath165 from the analysis of solar ( solar plus kamland ) data .",
    "a straightforward consequence of this is that normal mass orderings are favoured over inverse mass orderings .",
    "these results , in combination with a positive determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale from independent means , can be used as a test of these scenarios .",
