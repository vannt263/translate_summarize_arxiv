    "upon its discovery in 1992 , the lens system b0218 + 357 ( fig .",
    "1 , left ) was immediately recognised as an excellent candidate for determining @xmath0 .",
    "the source is radio loud , highly polarised and variable and both redshifts are known .",
    "modelling the mass responsible for the lensing is relatively simple compared to many other lenses as the deflector is believed to be an isolated face - on spiral galaxy .",
    "the einstein ring is potentially a particularly useful source of modelling constraints as it effectively samples the lensing potential over many lines - of - sight ( kochanek 1990 ) .",
    "the time delay has been measured to be 10.5@xmath10.4 days at 95% confidence ( biggs et al .",
    "1999 ) from vla monitoring of total flux density and polarisation at two frequencies , 8.4 and 15 ghz .",
    "although the time delay for this system is in little doubt , the above value has been independently confirmed ( cohen et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "modelling of this system is still at an early stage , but an initial singular isothermal ellipsoid mass model constrained using the observed vlbi substructure of the two compact images and the flux density ratio found from the vla monitoring , when combined with the above value of the time delay , gives an @xmath0 of 69@xmath2kms@xmath3mpc@xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "to date , no models have exploited the einstein ring for constraints on the lensing due to a lack of resolution and sensitivity in existing radio maps . a new image made from combined 5  ghz vla / multi - frequency synthesis merlin data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) .",
    "the merlin data give high resolution ( @xmath550 mas ) whilst the many short baselines of the vla provide much more sensitivity and aperture coverage for detecting and mapping the extended ring emission .",
    "the most prominent feature revealed by the new map is the hole in the centre of the ring , a hint of which is also seen in the 15  ghz vla image .",
    "the merlin 5 ghz map also shows valleys of reduced surface brightness stretching away north and south from the hole that make the ring s morphology more akin to that of two arcs .",
    "each of these is further separated into several discrete areas of increased brightness .",
    "work is at present underway to exploit this new image for extra modelling constraints .",
    "merlin is a national uk facility operated by the university of manchester on behalf of pparc .",
    "the vla is operated by the national radio astronomy observatory , which is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
