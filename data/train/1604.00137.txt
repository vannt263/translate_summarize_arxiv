    "the francium atom , which is the heaviest alkali element , has advantages as regards examination of the electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite and measurements of atomic parity nonconservation ( apnc ) @xcite .",
    "the fr atom exhibits high signal sensitivity because of the large effective electric field due to the large nuclear charge .",
    "the enhancement factor of a fr atom for electron edm is approximately 900 @xcite , and the e1 amplitude for a nuclear - spin - independent apnc in a fr atom is approximately 17 times larger than that of a cs atom @xcite . the finite value of the electron edm serves as the signature of violation of both parity ( @xmath1 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath2 ) invariance and apnc provide the signature of @xmath1 violation .",
    "searches for the violations of fundamental symmetries are important for evaluating a variety of the new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .    in conventional experiments using atomic and molecular beams @xcite , systematic errors and short interaction time of the atoms / molecules with the applied electric field",
    "are major obstacles restricting the measurement sensitivity .",
    "laser - cooled and trapped atoms elongate an interaction time between the atoms and applied electric field @xcite .",
    "therefore it is expected to improve the measurement sensitivity of the edm and apnc . moreover",
    ", this method reduces the atomic velocity and confines the atoms within a small region , which suppresses several systematic errors . at present",
    ", we are conducting a high - sensitivity search for the electron edm using laser - cooled fr atoms @xcite .",
    "radioactive fr is produced by a nuclear fusion reaction in a heated au target bombarded by a beam of accelerated 100 mev @xmath3o@xmath4 at the cyclotron and radioisotope center .",
    "the maximum yield of fr beam is estimated to be about 10@xmath5 ions / s .",
    "fr has also been produced at other facilities using different techniques @xcite .",
    "to stabilize the laser frequency of a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , the frequency reference , such as signals obtained by saturated absorption spectroscopy of atoms , is generally required for the frequency stabilization of the trapping light .",
    "it is also typically necessary for the repumping light in order to stabilize its frequency .",
    "however , fr atomic vapor cells as frequency references are not available because no stable fr isotopes exist .",
    "to search for the resonance frequency , the frequency of trapping light was scanned over a 60 mhz range at 0.5 mhz / s by monitoring the fluorescence of fr and the doppler - broadened absorption signal of i@xmath0 for first mot of fr @xcite .",
    "the frequency of repumping light is scanned over 500 mhz at a rate of 4 khz @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the frequencies of trapping and repumping lights are scanned independently . by contrast , the frequency of trapping ( repumping ) light in fr experiment is stabilized by using the scanned fabry - prot cavity .",
    "the length of cavity is scanned to monitor and keep the frequency difference between the trapping ( repumping ) light and i@xmath0-stabilized he - ne laser @xcite .",
    "the cavity with transfer laser is also utilized to determine the frequency difference @xcite",
    ". however , the transfer cavity technique is not useful to search for a resonance frequency of mot of fr by sweeping the trapping - light and repumping - light frequency with keeping its frequency difference of 46.1 ghz .    fr atom .",

    "@xmath8 is the repumping frequency .",
    "the frequency difference between @xmath8 and @xmath7 is typically less than 1 ghz . ]    in this paper , we demonstrate a frequency offset locking with 46 ghz between the trapping and repumping light beams , for the magneto - optical trapping of fr atoms using an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) . a frequency - offset locking technique can lock the frequency difference between the two laser sources to a constant value @xcite .",
    "this locking is used for frequency stabilization and also as a means of scanning both lasers simultaneously , while maintaining a constant frequency difference within a capture range . here , the capture range is the range in which the frequency of one laser follows the frequency sweep of the other with a 46-ghz frequency difference , using a servo loop .",
    "the offset locking technique offers alternative method to stabilize the laser frequencies for fr mot experiment .",
    "the frequency difference between the hyperfine splittings of @xmath9 of a @xmath10fr atom is 46.768 ghz , as shown in fig . [",

    "the frequency difference between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is 617 mhz @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the total angular momenta of the ground and excited states , respectively .",
    "therefore , as the beat frequency between the trapping and repumping light beams is about 46.1 ghz ( which includes a red - detuning of several tens of mhz for mot ) , the beat frequency of 46.1 ghz has to be detected . however , it is difficult for a photodetector to detect a 46-ghz frequency directly . on the other hand ,",
    "if one generates the sideband frequency with 46 ghz of trapping light and locks the frequency difference between this sideband and repumping light frequency , it is easy to lock the frequency difference between the trapping and repumping lights .",
    "however , in general , it is difficult to generate frequency components with 46 ghz at the first - order diffraction or sidebands through an acousto - optic modulator or an eom . here , instead of directly generating a first - order 46-ghz sideband",

    "the frequency difference between the repumping light and 10th - order component of the trapping light is typically less than 1 ghz , which can be easily observed as a beat signal using a standard - fast - silicon photo detector .",
    "the error signal can be obtained via the delayed self - homodyne detection of the beat signal .",
    "stabilization of frequency difference between the repumping - light frequency and 10th sideband of trapping - light frequency causes the offset locking of 46.1 ghz .",
    "this provides a simple and low cost method of maintaining a constant frequency difference of 46.1 ghz between the two laser sources .",
    "the experimental setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "a single - frequency ti : sapphire ( ti : s ) laser source ( coherent , mbr-110 ) for the trapping light was tuned to the @xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) d2 transition of the fr atom , with a wavelength of 718.216 nm .",
    "the output power of the ti : s laser was 3.5 w for a pump laser light output power of 18 w at 532 nm . after passing through a faraday isolator ( fi ) , part of the laser beam",
    "was reflected by a beam splitter ( bs ) and input into a wavelength meter ( wm ) .",
    "the transmitted laser beam was divided into two beams for magneto - optical trapping of the fr atoms and frequency offset locking by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the latter was phase - modulated using a polarization - maintaining fiber ( pmf)-coupled eom ( photline technologies , nir - mpx800-ln-05 ) , which was driven by an rf synthesizer with a frequency of 4.6 ghz to generate sidebands in an optical spectrum .",
    "the eom consists of a single - pass waveguide and possesses low driving voltage and large modulation bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the sideband frequencies @xmath19 generated by the eom were labeled @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the trapping frequency and rf from the synthesizer , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath23 indicates the order of the positive or negative sideband ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 corresponds to the trapping frequency ) , and @xmath26 indicates a higher frequency than the trapping frequency .",
    "the rf power input to the eom was amplified by an rf amplifier ( rfhic corporation , rum43020 - 10 ) up to approximately 37.1 dbm , so as to yield the @xmath2710th - order frequency sideband components .",
    "the power of incident light into the eom was 4.5 mw , and the power of transmitted light was typically 0.78 mw ( 17% transmission efficiency ) .",
    "note that the low transmission efficiency is due to the fact that the 718-nm wavelength is outside the specified range of the product @xcite .",
    "further , we employed a littrow - type external - cavity laser diode ( ecld , toptica photonics ) as the repumping light source .",
    "the wavelength of the light was tuned to the @xmath9 ( @xmath28 ) @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xmath12 ) transition at 718.137 nm and its output power was 36 mw .",
    "the laser beam from the ecld was split by a pbs after it passed through a fi and a bs , and it was input into a pmf using a fiber coupler ( fc ) .",
    "the trapping and repumping lights that is outgoing from the pmfs on output of eom were divided into two beams and overlapped by a 50:50 non - polarizing beam splitter ( npbs ) .",
    "they were detected by photodetector 1 ( pd1 ) after passing through a cavity `` fpc1 '' , so as to monitor their spectra , and by photodetector 2 ( pd2 , thorlabs fpd310-fv ) , so that the beat signal could be observed .",
    "the pd2 is useful for detection of laser power modulated with high frequency ranging from 1 mhz to 1.5 ghz .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of the beat signal was about 50 db , and the obtained 3db linewidth of the beat signal between the carrier and ecld ( the 10th sideband and ecld ) was about 1.0 mhz ( 1.2 mhz ) observed by using a spectrum analyzer with the resolution bandwidth ( rbw ) of 300 khz and the sweep time of 10 ms .",
    "fpc1 consisted of two mirrors ( layertec , # 110371 ) with 99% reflectivity and 12.7-mm diameter .",
    "as the distance between the two mirrors was 1.5 mm , the free spectral range of the cavity was estimated to be @xmath29 100 ghz .",
    "the cavity length could be varied using a hollow - piezoelectric actuator .",
    "further , the electric signal output from pd2 was amplified by 20 db and subsequently mixed with the signal output from a function generator ( fg ) using a double balanced mixer 1 ( dbm1 , shown in fig.2 ) .",

    "the signal was split into two by a power splitter ( ps ) and one part was delayed by a 1-m - long coax cable ( indicated as `` delay cable '' ) , before both signals were recombined by a second dbm ( dbm2 ) again .",
    "( note that the length of shorter path is almost negligible because the ps and dbm2 is directly connected , concerning the port of shorter pass . )",
    "the signal mixed by the dbm2 was expressed as @xcite    @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 represents the delay time , which is dependent on the difference in length between the two cable .",
    "the obtained output voltage varied as a function of @xmath37 @xcite because the higher harmonic components in the equation were suppressed considerably by passing through a 1-mhz low - pass filter ( lpf ) .",
    "the error signal was input into a proportional - integral circuit ( pic ) and then fed back to the piezoelectric driver for the ecld , in order to fix the frequency difference between the two light sources .",

    "the light from the ecld passed through an i@xmath0 cell and was subsequently transferred to a third photodetector ( pd3 ) .",
    "the input power was 60 @xmath38w , and 20-cm - long cell was heated to 573 k. when the repumping frequency was positioned at the center of the slope , the frequency change was converted into the amplitude based on the values detected using pd3 .",
    "figure [ absorption](b ) shows the transmitted intensity of repumping light , which relates to the repumping frequency via the slope of dap .",
    "after the repumping frequency was offset - locked , the trapping frequency was swept by a triangular waveform voltage with a repetition frequency of 1 hz , as shown in the range ( iii ) , which is from 9 to 17 s on the horizontal axis , in fig . 6 ( b ) .",
