    "it is now believed that hadrons are confined state of quarks .",
    "fundamental theory to explain hadrons is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "non - abelian nature of qcd leads to complicated non - perturbative structure of qcd vaccum .",
    "non - perturbative qcd vaccum leads to confinement of quarks at low energy .",
    "qcd on lattice confirms this and at the same time predicts that , at high energy density or baryon density , hadron goes to deconfined state called qgp @xcite . for the last 20 years , lot of experimental , theoretical and lattice simulation of qcd results were out , but there were no conclusive evidence for qgp and order of phase transition .",
    "this is probably because the exact nature of matter found in the urhics or in lattice simulations near @xmath0 is not well understood @xcite .",
    "both experimental results @xcite and lattice results @xcite show that matter formed near @xmath0 is non - ideal even at @xmath1 or above @xcite . there are lot of attempts to explain such a matter using various models like bag model , other confinement models , quasi - particle models , strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) etc .    in bag model @xcite ,",
    "qgp is considered as a big hadron with large number of partons interacting weakly confined by bag wall .",
    "this model is only partially successful .",
    "inclusions of glue balls or hadrons improve the results .",
    "the confinement models are the extension of bag model with smooth potential like cornel potential @xcite , relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite etc . again only partially successful . in quasi - particle models",
    "@xcite a new concept of calculating thermodynamics of qgp with partons having already thermal masses .",
    "there are different versions of quasiparticle model such as ( a ) with constant parton masses ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) and bag constant , @xmath4 @xcite , ( b ) with temperature dependent parton masses ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) and bag constant , @xmath7 , @xcite , ( c ) with further additional function called effective degrees of freedon , @xmath8 or @xmath9 to take account of the changes in degrees of freedom near @xmath0 @xcite , etc . all of them claim to explain lattice results , either by adjusting free parameters in the model or by taking lattice data on one of the thermodynamic quantity as an input and predicting other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "however , physical picture of quaiparticle model and the origin of various temperature dependent quanties are not clear yet @xcite . in sqgp @xcite , one considers all possible hadrons even at @xmath10 and try to explain non - ideal behavior of qgp near @xmath0 .",
    "here we propose that the qgp near @xmath0 is in fact what is called strongly coupled plasma @xcite , widely studied in qed plasma . by definition , plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior . at sufficiently high temperature neutral particles",
    "will be negligibly small so that one can see collective effects of plasma",
    ". otherwise it will be just ordinary neutral gas and not plasma .",
    "scp @xcite is a plasma where the plasma parameter , @xmath11 , defined as the ratio of average potential energy to average kinetic energy of the particles , is of the order of 1 or larger .",
    "similarly , qgp is a quasi - color - neutral gas of colored particles like quarks and gluons which exhibits collective behavior . here also to see collective effects color neutral objects like hadrons and glue balls must be negligibly small in number .",
    "otherwise , it is just a hadron gas and not qgp . in qed plasma , recombination and ionization",
    "are taking place with the same rate .",
    "similarly , in qgp such a process may be less because qgp is a deconfinement state where confinement effect due to qcd vacuum may be melted .",
    "atom is a bound state , but hadron is a confinement state .",
    "of course , there will be color coulombic interactions due to one gluon exchange with proper quantum effects like running coupling constant etc . and may just modify the properties of qgp like eos etc . in qed plasma also particles are interacting via coulombic force and it modifies eos . just like in qed plasma",
    ", here also we can have scp or scqgp whenever @xmath11 of qgp is of the order of 1 or greater .",
    "interesting thing is here also interactions potential is coulombic with proper modifications to take account of color degrees of freedom and quantum effects .",
    "therefore , eos of qgp may not much different from that of qed plasma .",
    "only difference is in @xmath11 .",
    "scp is widely studied by theoretical and numerical methods and eos of scp is parametrized as function of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we will show here that the same eos with @xmath11 for qgp , very nicely fits the lattice results on eos of gluon @xcite , 2-flavor as well as 3-flavor qgp @xcite .",
    "plasma parameters , @xmath11 , are different for three different systems .",
    "further extension of the model to include finite mass of the quarks , again , very nicely fits the lattice data on ( 2 + 1)-flavors and 4-flavors qgp .",
    "@xcite , we attempted to explain the non - ideal behaviour seen in lattice by considering cornel potential , coulomb @xmath12 linear confining potential , using mayer s cluster expansion method .",
    "it is only partially successful and near @xmath0 , the fit to lattice data is not good .",
    "this is because mayer s cluster expansion method is for weakly coupled system and hence concluded that qgp near @xmath0 might be strongly coupled . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we treated qgp as a strongly coupled color - coulombic plasma and modified eos of scp for gluon plasma and obtained a remarkably good fit to lattice data .",
    "hence we confirmed that qgp near and above @xmath0 is scqgp and speculated that it might have dramatic effects in urhics observables .",
    "here we reconfirm it by fitting lattice datas for all systems , namely , gluon plasma , 2-flavor and 3-flavor qgp sucessfully .",
    "let us briefly discuss the strongly coupled plasma .",
    "an extensive study of scp @xcite , theoretical and partially numerical , obtained an expression for eos of scp as a function of @xmath11 and is given by , @xmath13 where the nonideal ( or excess ) contribution to eos , @xmath14 , is given by , @xmath15 further @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath19 @xmath16 was derived by abe @xcite exactly in the giant cluster - expansion theory and is valid for @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is euler s constant .",
    "@xmath17 was evaluated by computer simulation of one component plasma ( ocp ) , where a single species of charged particles embedded in a uniform background of neutralizing charges and is valid for @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath14 is valid for all @xmath23 , including the range @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the final modified version @xcite of the original numerical solutions of hypernetted chain equation ( hnc ) of springer _ et .",
    "al . _ , valid for @xmath25 @xcite , agrees well with @xmath17 with discrepancies of less than @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is derived for strongly coupled coulombic plasma and rigorously verified .",
    "it may be valid for any coulombic plasma with appropriate change in charge or the coupling constant @xmath28 .",
    "let us now consider our model , scqgp .",
    "we assume that hadron exists for @xmath29 and goes to qgp for @xmath10 .",
    "that is , for @xmath10 it is the plasma of quarks and gluons and no hadrons or glue balls .",
    "but it is a strongly coupled plasma , which we call scqgp .",
    "the plasma parameter @xmath11 is defined as , @xmath30 where we have taken coulombic interaction between quarks , generally used in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the typical value of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and near the critical temperature , @xmath33 , we estimate @xmath34 .",
    "hence qgp is a strongly coupled plasma .",
    "later we will see that the @xmath11 which fits lattice results is indeed of the order of 1 .",
    "compared to qed , the fine structure constant , @xmath28 , is replaced by @xmath35 in coulombic interaction term .",
    "@xmath36 may be estimated as @xmath37 and hence @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number density .    in scp , where one generally has high enough temperature , electrons are in continuum state of atoms , i.e , ionized state , and negligibly small amount of neutral atoms . in scqgp",
    "also there may be negligibly small hadrons due to coulomb binding interactions . since it is a deconfined state",
    ", there is no confinement interactions .",
    "note the difference between sqgp and scqgp .",
    "in sqgp presence of various neutral and colored bound states due to coulomb interactions give rise to non - ideal effects .    our phenomenological model for scqgp",
    "is obtained by modifying eq .",
    "( [ eq : scp ] ) , to include relativistic and quantum effects as , @xmath40 where the first term @xmath41 corresponds to the ideal eos which , in our case , may be written as @xmath42 , ideal eos for massless relativistic gas .",
    "@xmath43 is a constant which depends on degrees of freedom .",
    "hence we write , @xmath44 we assume that the functional form of @xmath14 is the same as that of scp , but @xmath11 , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaa ] ) , is , @xmath45 where we have taken @xmath46 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that scqgp is also governed by coulombic type interactions , i.e , color coulombic interaction .",
    "only new thing is @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in scp @xmath47",
    "is 1 and in scqgp it is different for gluon plasma and flavored qgp because of different group structures involved in their interactions .",
    "similarly , @xmath49constant in scp , but in scqgp , including quantum effects , it is a running coupling constant @xmath48 , given by , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of flavors and @xmath52 is a parameter , related to qcd scale parameter . since lattice results are with two - loop order running coupling constant , we have chosen similar form .",
    "finally , we have a phenomenological eos for scqgp with two parameters @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "both of them depends on type of qgp .",
    "any shortcoming may be reflected in the correctness of these parameters . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , we get @xmath53 and using the relation , @xmath54 we get the pressure @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the pressure at some reference temperature @xmath57 . and may be fixed to one of the lattice data points or at critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "once we know @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 can be evaluated .    in the case of qgp with finite quark masses , the @xmath51 in the expression for @xmath61 and hence in @xmath11 must be replaced by effective @xmath51 , @xmath62 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fig . 1 , we plotted @xmath63 vs @xmath64 for pure gauge , 2-flavor and 3-flavor qgp along with lattice results .",
    "note that , in the case of flavored qgp , since there is @xmath65 uncertainty in @xmath58 data @xcite on taking continum limit with massless quarks @xcite , we multiply the lattice data by the factor @xmath66 and is plotted . for each system @xmath47 and @xmath52 are adjusted so that we get a good fit to lattice results .",
    "we have fixed @xmath56 from the lattice data at the critical temperature @xmath0 for each system .",
    "surprisingly good fit is obtained for all systems with @xmath67 for gluon plasma and @xmath68 for both 2-flavor and 3-flavor qgp .",
    "@xmath52 are different for all systems with values 137.5 , 80.5 and 37 for gluon plasma , 2-flavor and 3-flavor qgp respectively .",
    "we have taken @xmath51 equal to @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively for three systems .",
    "the values of @xmath47 are not that unreasonable since they are close to the eigen values of quadratic casimir operators , @xmath71 for pure gauge and @xmath72 for quarks .",
    "once @xmath73 is obtained , then other macroscopic quantities such as @xmath59 , @xmath74 etc . are derivable from @xmath73 and no other parameters are needed . in fig .",
    "2 , we plotted @xmath75 vs @xmath76 for all three systems along with lattice results and a resonably good fit is obtained without any extra parameters .",
    "all the three curves looks similar , but shifts to left as flavor content increases .",
    "we have taken @xmath0 equal to @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80 respectively for gluon plasma , 2-flavor and 3-flavor qgp .    in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath74 is plotted for all three systems , again with lattice results for gluon plasma .",
    "reasonably good fit for gluon plasma and our predictions for the flavored qgp .",
    "all the three curves have similar behaviour , i.e , sharp rise near @xmath0 and then flatten to the value close to @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath74 is larger for larger flavor content .",
    "very close to @xmath82 , fits or predictions of our model may not be good , especially for @xmath59 and @xmath74 which strongly depends on variations of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "lattice data also has large error bars very close to @xmath0 . however , except for small region at @xmath82 , our results are very good for all regions of @xmath83 .    in fig.s 4 and 5",
    ", we plotted @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "we see that qgp near @xmath87 upto several @xmath0 is really strongly coupled since @xmath11 is the order of 1 .",
    "we see from the plot that pure gauge is more strongly coupled than flavored qgp .",
    "it is interesting to note that recently peshier and cassing @xcite also obtained similar results on @xmath11 as a function of @xmath64 in quai - particle model and concluded that qgp behaves like a liquid .    in fig.6 , we included the results on ( 2 + 1)-flavors and 4-flavors qgp from our model along with lattice data @xcite and replotted @xmath88 vs @xmath86 for all systems .",
    "similar plots for @xmath89 vs @xmath86 for all systems is replotted in fig",
    "the fitted parameters for various systems are tabulated in table 1 . the effective number of flavors , @xmath62 is @xmath90 for ( 2 + 1)-flavor qgp and @xmath91 , @xmath92 for 4-flavor qgp with mass @xmath93 equal to @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "masses @xmath93 in the case of ( 2 + 1)-flavors are @xmath94 and @xmath96 for light and heavy quarks respectively .",
    "using a phenomenological model to treat qgp near and above @xmath82 as scqgp , obtained by appropriate modifications of the results of scp to take account of color and flavor degrees of freedom and quantum effects , a surprisingly good fits to lattice results are obtained .",
    "basic idea is that scp and scqgp both are nonideal because of coulombic interactions .",
    "so we expect similar eos .",
    "modification of scp to scqgp introduces system dependent two parameters which we vary to get good fit to lattice results for pressure @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath74 etc . then follows from @xmath58 without any extra parameters .",
    "when we extend our model to include systems with finite quark mass , again , a remarkable good fits are obtained to ( 2 + 1)-flavors and 4-flavors qgp .",
    "hence we have a unified model with just two system dependent parameters , namely scqgp , to explain the non - ideal effects seen in the lattice simulation of qcd in various systems like pure gauge , 2-flavors , 3-flavors , ( 2 + 1)-flavors and 4-flavors qgp . of course , to understand the values of the parameters , @xmath47 and @xmath52 , one need much more general analytic theory based on qcd .",
    "it is also interesting to see the modifications of urhics results by treating qgp as scqgp , since the energy density and hence temperature is in the range of few @xmath0 . + * acknowledgement : *      99 j. cleymans , r. v. gavai and e. suhonen , phys . rep .",
