    "the wide interest attracted by the homogeneous cosmological models of the bianchi classification relies over all in the allowance for their anisotropic dynamics ; among them the types viii and ix stand because of their chaotic evolution toward the initial singularity @xcite that correspond to the maximum degree of generality allowed by the homogeneity constraint ; as a consequence it was shown @xcite that the generic cosmological solution can be described properly , near the big - bang , in terms of the homogeneous chaotic dynamics as referred to each cosmological horizon . however the correspondence existing between the homogeneous dynamics and the generic inhomogeneous one holds only in four space - time dimensions .",
    "in fact a generic cosmological inhomogeneous model remains characterized by chaos near the big - bang up to a ten dimensional space - time @xcite while the homogeneous models show a regular ( chaos free ) dynamics beyond four dimensions @xcite.here we address an hamiltonian point of view showing how the homogeneous models ( of each type ) perform , near the singularity , an oscillatory regime in correspondence to any number of dimensions , as soon as an electromagnetic field is included in the dynamics .",
    "let us consider the standard @xmath0-dimensional vector - tensor theory in the adm representation : @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote respectively the super - hamiltonian and super - momentum , @xmath6 is the electromagnetic tensor , @xmath7 is the determinant of the n - metric , @xmath8 is the n - scalar of curvature and @xmath9.since the sources are absent , it is enough to consider only the transverse components for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; therefore , we take the gauge conditions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . when going over the homogeneous case , we choose the gauge @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "+ let s adopt the kasner parameterization , that is based on the metric and conjugate momentum decomposition along spatial n - bein : @xmath16 we also define a dual basis @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 and @xmath19.we want to put in evidence the oscillatory regime that the bein vectors possess and so we distinguish scale functions and the parallel from the transverse component ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 @xmath22 the standard kasner solution is obtained as soon as the limit in which all the terms @xmath23 become of higher order is taken @xmath24 @xmath25 the kasner indexes @xmath26 satisfy the identities @xmath27 .",
    "if we order the @xmath28 s , the largest increasing term ( as @xmath29 @xmath30 ) among the neglected ones comes from @xmath31 and it is to be taken into account to construct the oscillatory regime toward the cosmological singularity .",
    "@xmath32 the first of equations ( [ 28 ] ) gives @xmath33 , while the second admits the solution @xmath34 the remaining part of the dynamical system allows us to determine the return map governing the replacements of kasner epochs and the rotation of kasner vectors @xmath35 through these epochs @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38    thus the homogeneous universes here discussed approaches the initial singularity being described by a metric tensor with oscillating scale factors and rotating kasner vectors .",
    "the presence of a vector field is crucial because , independently on the considered model , it induces a closed domain on the configuration space ."
