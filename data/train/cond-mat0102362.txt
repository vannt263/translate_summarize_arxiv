    "the most commonly used approach to describe a dilute gas of atoms in a bec at @xmath3 is mean - field theory , which takes the form of the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) : @xmath4 where the three - dimensional coupling constant is @xmath5 , a is the s - wave scattering length , @xmath6 is the external trapping potential , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , and n is the number of condensate atoms .",
    "the complex order parameter , @xmath8 , is referred to as `` the wave function of the condensate . ''",
    "the @xmath9 thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) has been proven to be a highly successful analytical approximation of the gpe @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath10 tfa is its simplicity : neglecting the kinetic energy results in a simple approximation of the ground - state condensate density that is effective in analyzing properties of large - n condensates . for condensates with a moderate number of atoms and condensates with attractive interactions ,",
    "the tfa breaks down .",
    "the kinetic energy is important in each case , especially in the latter , where the kinetic energy is necessary to prevent collapse .",
    "the effects of attractive interactions have been studied using approximation techniques such as variational trial wave functions @xcite .",
    "other approximations that have been employed to extend the tf regime of validity include the @xmath11 tfa @xcite , a method that uses two - point pad approximants between the weakly- and strongly - interacting limits of the ground - state @xcite , and a variational method for anisotropic condensates @xcite .    with the study of bec in highly anisotropic traps as a motivation , we use a perturbation formalism that permits the effective dimensionality , d , to vary .",
    "because it readily allows one to approximate quantities in any dimension , such a formalism is ideally suited for condensates in the anisotropic traps used in many laboratories where the condensate can be effectively one- , two- or three - dimensional .",
    "the perturbation parameter is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 depends on the effective dimensionality of the condensate and on the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "the @xmath12 limit becomes an exactly soluble problem , the solution of which is used by the various dimensional - scaling methods as the starting point for the solution of the full three - dimensional problem @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 approximation to the condensate density , which retains part of the kinetic energy , is quite accurate for both a large and moderate number of atoms in the bec ground state , and the dimensional scaling formalism , which treats the dimensionality as a parameter , is advantageous when studying condensates of low effective dimensionality due to extreme trap anisotropy .",
    "the centrifugal term in the @xmath12 density also makes it a good physical starting point for treating vortex states .",
    "in the case of positive scattering length , the repulsive interaction causes the density to become flat , and the kinetic energy of the condensate becomes negligible in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "this limit of the gpe results in the highly successful classical approximation for the density of the condensate ground - state known as the thomas - fermi approximation ( @xmath10 tfa ) .",
    "the @xmath10 tfa for the ground state in a three - dimensional isotropic trap is @xcite @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 elsewhere .",
    "( [ tfdensity ] ) provides an excellent description of the condensate ground - state density in the bulk interior .",
    "this approximation breaks down near the surface of the gas where the density is not flat ; the wave function must vanish smoothly , making the kinetic energy appreciable in the boundary layer .",
    "the chemical potential is obtained from continuity and normalization of eq .",

    "one finds @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the thomas - fermi classical cutoff radius in oscillator units of length , @xmath19 .",
    "boundary layer theory techniques have been employed to obtain corrections to the @xmath10 tfa at the condensate surface where the gradient of the density is no longer small @xcite .",
    "the leading order correction to the ground state chemical potential due to the boundary layer at the surface is of order @xmath20 .",
    "we use a perturbation formalism where the effective dimensionality , d , of the condensate is allowed to vary .",
    "the effective - dimensionality of the condensate depends on the relative size of the confinement length in each of the three spatial dimensions .",
    "most experimentally realized traps are axially symmetric with some having a high degree of anisotropy @xcite . in the case of axial symmetry",
    ", the trapping potential takes the form , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a measure of the degree of anisotropy .",
    "the system reduces to a three - dimensional isotropic condensate for @xmath23 . in the small- ( large- ) @xmath24 limits , the system reduces to an effective one- ( two-)dimensional isotropic condensate .",
    "it is conceivable that an isotropic hamiltonian in a fractional - dimensional space could be used to describe experimental condensates for intervening values of @xmath24 , but we will focus our attention on integer dimensions .    as an illustration ,",
    "consider @xmath25 where the motion of the atoms in the z - direction becomes frozen and their motion is described by a gaussian of small width . to determine the 2d effective coupling constant",
    ", we assume the wave function in eq.([gpe ] ) is separable : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is assumed to be a gaussian , and operating with @xmath28 , one finds a new effective 2d gpe : @xmath29 which has the same form as eq .",

    ", we will adopt a notation for the number of atoms that is similar to that of jackson et .",

    "for @xmath37 , one may assume the motion in the radial - direction in the x - y plane is described by a gaussian of small width , @xmath38 , and , following the same procedure , one obtains a 1d equation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ 2dex ] ) , where @xmath39 would represent the number of atoms in the 1d condensate per unit area in the xy - plane .",
    "we begin by explicitly generalizing the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) , to d - dimensions where r becomes the radius of a d - dimensional sphere with d-1 remaining angles .",
    "the laplacian is generalized to d - dimensions ( bohn , esry and greene@xcite treat the laplacian in a similar fashion , in which they use hyperspherical coordinates to define a mean condensate radius . ) , and the potential terms retain their three - dimensional form ; the coupling constant is generalized in the final scaling .",

    "the final scaling is to scaled oscillator units ( denoted by bars ) : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . combining these two scalings ,",

    "( [ scaledgpe ] ) valid for describing condensates in any effective dimension . in the next section ,",
    "we describe a simple and accurate zeroth - order approximation to eq.([scaledgpe ] ) .",
    "it has been pointed out by schuck and vias @xcite that the true tf limit ( @xmath64 as originally applied to the case of fermi statistics @xcite ) is not equivalent to @xmath9 , and they show that the @xmath65 tf limit for bosons does not neglect the kinetic energy for the ground state .",
    "the @xmath10 tfa to the ground state is too harsh on the kinetic energy for a moderate number of atoms .",
    "a less harsh and nearly as simple approximation is the zeroth - order ( @xmath12 ) approximation of eq .",
    "( [ scaledgpe ] ) . unlike the ground - state @xmath10 tfa , which neglects the entire kinetic energy , our zeroth - order approximation of the generalized gpe neglects the derivative part of the kinetic energy but retains a centrifugal term . for vortex states",
    ", one understands this term as being a centrifugal barrier due to quantized circulation , which pushes atoms away from the axis of rotation .",
    "this centrifugal barrier arises from the condensate phase : @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the condensate density and @xmath69 is the spatially dependent condensate phase ; then the condensate velocity is given by @xmath70 ) .",
    "for the ground state , this centrifugal term in the zeroth - order density has an alternate , quantum mechanical interpretation , which helps explain its good agreement with numerical calculations .",

    "presently , however , vortices in 3d radially symmetric traps are not realized .",
    "vortex states in a 2d isotropic trap do not pose a problem to theory because the spherical harmonic wave function acts as a phase factor . in 1d ,",

    "( [ dptdensity ] ) is valid where the density is non - negative .",

    "the numerical effect of the centrifugal - like term in the zeroth - order approximation on the ground state of a stationary condensate is clear from fig .  [",

    "the accuracy of the zeroth - order approximation is comparable to boundary layer corrections : the zeroth - order approximation is slightly more accurate for small coupling constant , while boundary layer theory is slightly more accurate for larger coupling constant , but the difference between all three approximations becomes small for very large coupling constant .",
    "the correct physical interpretation of this centrifugal - like term , as originally noted by chatterjee@xcite , is that it is the component of the kinetic energy needed to satisfy the minimum uncertainty principle .",
    "the zeroth - order density includes a centrifugal term from the kinetic energy , which pushes the wave function away from the origin in the ground state as if there were a non - zero quantum of angular momentum ; however , the @xmath92 contribution to the ground state density of a nonrotating cloud clearly is not due to any rotational motion of the cloud .",
    "this effect , which becomes less pronounced as n increases , is demonstrated in figs .",

    "the centrifugal - like term in the lowest order of dimensional perturbation theory ( @xmath12 ) can be understood as arising from the requirement that the system s uncertainty product be a minimum@xcite . another way to see how a centrifugal term may arise in the ground state  this time within the @xmath10 tfa  is by applying the langer modification of wkb theory to the @xmath10 tf density . for vortices",

    "( [ tfdensity ] ) that includes vortices is @xmath94 for a spherical trap , @xmath95 , which reduces to the usual ground state @xmath10 tf density for @xmath77 , but using the langer modification , where the correct asymptotic phase of the wkb wave function is obtained by the replacement @xmath96 in the centrifugal potential , a centrifugal barrier remains in the ground - state : @xmath97 the dependence of our perturbation parameter on the angular momentum quantum number suggests that the zeroth - order density will be a good physical starting point for vortex states , which we explore in the next section for @xmath98 .",
    "the remaining centrifugal term in our zeroth - order approximation is a lowest - order correction to the kinetic energy , which , for a moderate number of atoms , greatly improves the ground state approximation ( @xmath77 ) over the @xmath10 tfa . for a very large number of atoms ,",
    "the contribution from the kinetic energy becomes very small , as can be seen by comparing the wave functions in figs.[fig : gwf1 ] and [ fig : gwf2 ] , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath91 atoms , respectively .",
    "as the number of atoms increases , our unphysical core becomes smaller than the healing length , eventually vanishing : our zeroth - order and the @xmath10 tf wave functions become indistinguishable from the numerical solution for large n.",

    "we allow the effective dimensionality of the condensate to be a variable quantity , and we use the parameter @xmath0 to scale the gpe in arbitrary dimension , where @xmath1 depends on the effective dimensionality of the condensate and on the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "we have shown that our zeroth - order ( @xmath12 ) limit of the gross - pitaevskii equation provides a less severe approximation of the kinetic energy than the @xmath2 thomas - fermi approximation for the ground state , which neglects the entire kinetic energy .",
    "the zeroth - order ( @xmath12 ) limit is a simple approximation that , in order to satisfy the minimum uncertainty principle , retains a kinetic energy contribution , rather than neglecting the entire ke , making it more accurate and flexible than the ground - state @xmath10 tfa . as shown in fig .  [ fig : mucompare ] , our zeroth - order approximation is more accurate than the @xmath10 tfa for the chemical potential .",
    "this improvement is caused by the centrifugal - like term , which brings in the kinetic energy needed to satisfy the minimum uncertainty principle and which adds a needed outward push to the wave function .",
    "the accuracy of the zeroth - order approximation is comparable to the lowest order correction due to the boundary layer at the condensate surface .",
    "improved accuracy for the ground state is most noticeable for a moderate number of atoms , the case in which the kinetic energy is most significant . for a sufficiently large number of atoms with positive scattering length ,",
    "the kinetic energy becomes small for the ground state chemical potential , and the three approximations converge to the numerical solution of the gpe .",
    "the core near the origin and the presence of the angular momentum quantum number , @xmath43 , in the scaling parameter , @xmath119 , make the zeroth - order ( @xmath12 ) density an especially good starting point for studying properties of vortices .",
    "the ground - state @xmath10 tfa is unable to accommodate such states , but it can be extended to include vortices by introducing the gradient of the phase from the laplacian @xcite .",
    "we expect higher order , finite-@xmath120 corrections to further refine the shape of our zeroth - order density for the ground state and vortex states .",
    "we have shown that the dimensional scaling formalism is conducive to analysis of condensates of any dimension .",
    "we outlined how simple yet accurate approximations can be achieved for any effective d , and we demonstrated the improved numerical results for @xmath111 .",
    "in addition to 3d bec , the dimensional scaling formalism provides a useful analytical tool in the study of bec in lower effective dimensionality . in future work",
    ", we plan to test the approximation presented here on other observables and states of bec in d - dimensions , and we are extending the methods presented herein to d - dimensional cylindrical coordinates , where the anisotropy parameter is included explicitly for treatment of axially symmetric traps with arbitrary anisotropy .",
