    "time averaged potentials ( tap ) offer a versatile tool for trapping both charged and neutral particles . for neutral atoms",
    "the most common example in this class of traps is the time - averaged orbiting potential ( top ) which was used in the experiments in which the first bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) was created @xcite .",
    "the top trap consists a magnetic quadrupole trap @xcite shifted by a uniform magnetic modulation field rotating at a high ( audio ) frequency . as this rotation",
    "is slow as compared to the larmor precession of the atomic magnetic moments , the atoms remain polarized with respect to the instantaneous effective magnetic field @xcite as follows from the adiabatic theorem . on the other hand",
    "the rotation is fast as compared to the orbital motion of the atoms . as a consequence ,",
    "the atomic motion consists of a fast rotating part ( micromotion ) , superimposed on a slow oscillating part ( macromotion ) . in the simplest theoretical description , the static approximation , the micromotion is eliminated by time - averaging the instantaneous potential over a full cycle of the modulation field .",
    "suppose we load a particle with given momentum @xmath0 at position @xmath1 in a top trap using a sudden switch - on procedure .",
    "one might naively guess that the ensuing motion is given by the dynamics in the time - averaged potential , subject to the initial conditions * * @xmath2 and @xmath3 but this guess turns out to be wrong .",
    "in fact , one can show that the initial conditions for the slow motion depend on the phase of the top at the time of switch - on .",
    "this phenomenon was analyzed by ridinger and coworkers @xcite for the special case of a one - dimensional rapidly oscillating potential ( rop ) with zero average .",
    "ridinger et al",
    ".  also showed , first for a classical particle @xcite and subsequently for the quantum case @xcite , that the amplitude and energy associated with the slow motion can be altered by applying a suitable phase jump in the rapidly oscillating field .    in this paper",
    "we show , both theoretically and experimentally , that the dependence on initial phase and the possibility to influence the motion by phase jumps , is also present for a two - dimensional rotating top field .",
    "in particular we show that a cloud of atoms which is initially at rest with zero momentum acquires a sloshing motion as soon as the top is suddenly switched on .",
    "this is true even if the cloud is initially at the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "the amplitude of this slow macromotion is much larger than that of the fast micromotion while the direction of sloshing depends on the top phase at switch - on .",
    "we also demonstrate that this macromotion can be almost entirely quenched by applying a carefully timed and sized phase jump in the top field .",
    "the motion of atoms and ultracold atomic clouds in top traps have been extensively described in the literature . following the achievement of the first bec @xcite ,",
    "the use of the axially symmetric top was described theoretically in @xcite and explored experimentally by other groups @xcite to study properties of the bec .",
    "the idea of the top was extended to an asymmetric triaxial top trap developed by @xcite and also used by other groups @xcite .",
    "further a number of other variations were introduced : in many cases , it turns out to be convenient to switch on the top after a preparative stage of cooling in a conventional static trap such as a magnetic quadrupole trap ( see e.g.@xcite ) , an optically plugged magnetic quadrupole @xcite and ioffe - configurations @xcite .",
    "often , the transfer of the cloud from the static to the top trap can not be performed adiabatically for topological reasons .",
    "bearing this in mind , it becomes relevant to carefully analyze the dynamics that may be induced by a sudden switch - on of the top .",
    "in addition , applications which require manipulation of a bec are heavily dependent on precise control of the location of the atomic cloud and can thus benefit from the techniques described .    in our experiments",
    "the condensate is prepared in a ioffe - pritchard ( ip ) trap before transferring to a top because the use of radio - frequency ( rf ) induced evaporative cooling is more efficient in a static magnetic trap , resulting in larger condensates . once transferred to the top",
    "we can create trapping geometries that are difficult to realize using a static magnetic potential without introducing majorana losses associated with the presence of zero - field points .",
    "an example is the double well potential used in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we calculate the motion of a cloud of atoms in a top which at switch - on is at rest at the center of the trap . we discuss the motion that results and derive the conditions under which a phase jump can lead to a substantial reduction of the energy associated with the slow motion of the cloud . in section [ experimentaldetails ]",
    "we discuss the experimental details and the preparation of the bec and its transfer to the top . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the experimental results and compare with the theory of section [ theory ] .",
    "finally in section [ discussion and outlook ] we give a summary and conclusion .",
    "in the literature the term top is most often used for a spherical - quadrupole trap combined with a rotating uniform magnetic modulation field . in this paper",
    "we will use the term top in a broader context , to include the magnetic trapping potential created by combining a ip trap with rotating modulation field .",
    "challis et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the dynamical eigenstates of a degenerate bose gas in a top are given by solutions of the usual gross - pitaevskii equation but taken in a circularly translating reference frame , that is , a reference frame the origin of which performs a rapid circular motion but retains a constant orientation .",
    "in particular this implies that the center of mass of a condensate in its ground state performs the same micromotion in a top as a point particle with the magnetic moment of an atom . in this spirit",
    "we use as a @xmath4rb condensate to study the micromotion and macromotion in a top .",
    "we consider a cigar - shaped ioffe - pritchard potential @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radial position of a test atom with respect to the ip symmetry axis , @xmath7 the magnetic moment of the atom , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 the parameters for the radial gradient , the axial curvature and offset value of the ip magnetic field .",
    "eq.([instantpotential ] ) represents an approximate expression for the ip trap which is valid for @xmath11 and in the limit @xmath12 @xcite .    in the presence of the top field we transform to the circularly translating frame @xcite and have@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the position of the atom in the laboratory frame and the ip symmetry axis",
    "is displaced over a distance @xmath15 in the direction @xmath16 by the uniform modulation field @xmath17 applied perpendicular to the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the @xmath19 axis is taken along the vertical direction , the @xmath20 plane being horizontal .",
    "the modulation field @xmath21 rotates at angular frequency @xmath22 ( phase @xmath23 ) about the horizontal @xmath18 axis as illustrated in fig.[fig : circleofdeath ] .",
    "notice that the sense of rotation of the ip - field - minimum is opposite to that of the @xmath21 field , in contrast to the original top configuration @xcite , where the field - zero rotates in the same direction as the bias field .",
    "this reflects the difference between the 2d - quadrupole symmetry of the ip trap and the axial symmetry of the spherical - quadrupole trap .",
    "the rotation of the modulation field @xmath21 also gives rise to a fictitious field @xmath24 which has to be added or subtracted from the offset field @xmath25 , depending on the sense of rotation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the larmor frequency of magnetic moment of the atoms , with @xmath28 the hyperfine @xmath29 factor and @xmath30 the bohr magneton . in a standard top , the fictitious field in combination with gradient of the quadrupole field gives rise to a shift of the equilibrium position of the cloud in the direction of the axis around which the field rotates @xcite . in our ip - top",
    "the axial field is homogeneous near the origin and the shift is absent ; the change in @xmath10 turns out to be small and will be neglected in this paper .    for @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "the potential @xmath33 corresponds to that of a two - dimensional quadrupole field with a zero - field line that rotates at distance @xmath34 about the @xmath18 axis as a result of the modulation . for @xmath32",
    "the distance @xmath34 is known as the radius of the ` circle of death ' . for @xmath35",
    "the potential corresponds to two top traps separated by @xmath36 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider only the case @xmath37 .    in the common description of the top one",
    "analyzes the motion in an effective potential , obtained by time averaging the static trap over a full rotation period of the @xmath21 field . for eq.([instantpotential ] ) this procedure yields the effective potential@xmath38 where @xmath39 . for the cigar - shaped ip potential",
    "we consider the condition @xmath40 where , for an atom of mass @xmath41 , the quantity @xmath42 is the axial harmonic oscillation frequency in the effective potential @xmath43 .",
    "analogously , harmonic oscillation frequency in the radial plane is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is offset value of the effective potential at the origin @xcite .",
    "the first inequality in eq.([topcondition ] ) ensures that the fast and slow radial motions of the atoms can be separated , which is the well - known operating regime for a top trap @xcite .",
    "the second inequality implies that the axial motion in the effective trap is slowest and that the motion can be treated as quasi two - dimensional in the radial plane .    to account for the acceleration due to gravity @xmath46",
    ", the gravitational potential @xmath47 has to be added to eqs.([instantpotential ] ) and ( [ toppotential ] ) .",
    "the main effect is to shift the minimum of the potentials in the negative @xmath19 direction by the amount@xmath48 this expression holds as long as the gravitational sag @xmath49 is much smaller than the harmonic radius @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath51 , the effective potential ( [ toppotential ] ) may be treated as harmonic as long as the motion is confined to a region around the @xmath18 axis that is small compared to @xmath34 . for our experiment the harmonic approximation holds rather well and is sufficient for gaining qualitative insight in the micro- and macromotion as will be shown in section [ sec : micromotion and macromotion ] .",
    "refinements associated with switch - on transients and gravity are discussed in appendix [ app : delayed sudden - step model ] . in the numerical analysis of section [ sec : numerical analysis ] , we solve the classical equations of motion in the full time - dependent potential eq.([instantpotential ] ) . in this context",
    "we also comment on the validity of the harmonic approximation .      to analyze the effect of switching on the @xmath21 field at @xmath52 we first consider an atom ` at rest ' in the center of the effective trapping potential @xmath53 .",
    "such an atom exhibits no period - averaged dynamics ( no macromotion ) but only circular micromotion at a frequency @xmath54 about the origin as illustrated in fig.[fig : circleofdeath ] .",
    "the radius of this stationary micromotion,@xmath55 follows from the condition @xmath56 for the centripetal force @xmath57 .",
    "the speed of this stationary micromotion , @xmath58 is directed orthogonally to the direction @xmath59 .",
    "such pure micromotion only results if at @xmath52 the atom is already moving at speed @xmath60 along a circle of radius @xmath61 about the origin and is located at position @xmath62 ( see fig.[fig : circleofdeath ] ) .",
    "./fig1.eps    obviously an atom at @xmath52 at rest at the origin , @xmath63 does not satisfy these initial conditions and as a consequence its macromotion will start with a finite launch speed .",
    "we will see that the result is elliptical motion at frequency @xmath64 , with the long axis approximately perpendicular to the initial direction of @xmath59 and with a substantial amplitude , of order @xmath65 .",
    "usually this motion is undesired and our aim is to quantify it and subsequently quench it by imparting a phase jump to the top - field .    to gain insight into the way in which the sudden switch - on of the top influences the macromotion of an atom initially at rest at the origin , we first consider a simple model in which it is assumed that the motion in the radial plane can be decomposed into two harmonic components , oscillating at the micromotion and macromotion frequencies @xmath54 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the position @xmath66 and velocity @xmath67 are given by@xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 is the amplitude , @xmath71 @xmath72 the velocity amplitude and @xmath73 @xmath74 the initial phase of the macromotion in @xmath75 @xmath76 direction ; @xmath77 is the initial phase of the micromotion .",
    "the atom starts at rest at the origin , hence the initial conditions are @xmath78 at @xmath52 . if the condition @xmath79 is satisfied , the acceleration due to the micromotion dominates over that of the macromotion .",
    "the total acceleration may be approximated by @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , @xmath81 points in the direction @xmath59 , which is opposite to the direction of @xmath82 ( as per fig.[fig : circleofdeath ] ) . hence , the initial phase of the micromotion is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is fixed by the phase of the rotating @xmath21 field @xcite . without loss of generality we can set @xmath85 , which means that @xmath86 is oriented along the positive @xmath75 direction at @xmath52 . with this choice and setting @xmath87",
    ", we find from the initial conditions : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "substituting these values in eq.([r_approx ] ) we obtain an equation for the macromotion representing an elliptical orbit with its major axis oriented perpendicular to the instantaneous direction @xmath59 of the @xmath21 field at @xmath52 .",
    "since the amplitude of the macromotion along its major axis is larger than the micromotion by the factor @xmath91 , a substantial sloshing motion results from the sudden switch - on . note that with increasing @xmath54 , the micromotion amplitude @xmath61 decreases like @xmath92 whereas the amplitude of the sloshing motion @xmath93 decreases only like @xmath94 .",
    "for this reason the sloshing can not be neglected in most practical cases involving audio - frequency modulation .",
    "./fig2.eps      to validate the analytical model introduced in section [ sec : micromotion and macromotion ] , we numerically integrate the classical equations of motion in the full time - dependent potential given by eq.([instantpotential ] ) for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath85 .",
    "the result for the trajectory is given in fig.[theortraject ] and exhibits the sloshing macromotion described above .",

    "the figure clearly shows the micromotion superimposed onto the macromotion orientated along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the amplitudes and phases of the macromotion obtained by fitting eq.([r_approx ] ) to the results of the numerical calculation agree accurately with the analytical model of section [ sec : micromotion and macromotion ] ( see table  [ table : fitresultsa ] ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison reveals that anharmonicities play a minor role ; the harmonics of both the micro- and macromotion have amplitudes which are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the fundamentals .    in order to allow a better comparison with the experiments to be discussed below",
    "we have also performed the numerical analysis including several refinements that pertain to our specific experimental situation .",
    "these effects are : ( a ) a difference @xmath117 in gravitational sag between the ip and the top trap ; ( b ) an exponential switching transient of the current in the top coils and correspondingly in the @xmath21 field @xmath118 ; ( c ) a switching transient of @xmath119 in the offset field from @xmath120 at the @xmath52 to the final value @xmath121 .",
    "the initial gravitational sag in the ip trap is @xmath122 when switching on the top , the sag @xmath49 jumps in @xmath123 to @xmath124 and settles in @xmath119 to its final value @xmath125 due to the decrease of @xmath10 .",
    "thus the gravitational sag increases jump wise and settles at @xmath126 . during the same transient the radius of the stationary micromotion grows from @xmath127 to @xmath128 and @xmath64 increases by about @xmath129 .",
    "the dotted red traces in fig.[theortraject ] correspond to the numerical calculation including all the above refinements relevant to the experiments .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of gravity , @xmath21-switching and @xmath10-switching separately .",
    "we find that the main effect of the settling time of @xmath10 is to reduce the amplitude along the major axis by @xmath130 .",
    "the combined effect of changing gravitational sag and @xmath21 transient is to slightly increase the @xmath75 amplitude as well as to produce a slight tilt angle of the trajectory ( see right - most panel of fig.[theortraject ] ) .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath131 of the macromotion also follows from a fit of eq.([r_approx ] ) to the numerical results : for known values of @xmath69 , @xmath93 , @xmath73 and @xmath132 the angle of rotation @xmath133 to align the coordinate system along the major and minor axis is given by@xmath134",

    "extending the analytical model to include the refinements ( a ) and ( b ) is straightforward and given in detail in appendix [ app : delayed sudden - step model ] .",
    "the expressions for the amplitudes and phases depend on the model parameter @xmath136 and are given by eqs.([x0])-([phi - y ] ) of the appendix .",
    "the model parameter @xmath136 is chosen by ensuring that the value of the tilt angle @xmath131 of the model reproduces that of a fit to the numerical solution for zero settling time , @xmath137 .",
    "this results in @xmath138 .",
    "excellent agreement is obtained with the numerical model as is shown in table  [ table : fitresultsa ] .",
    "insight in the cause of the reduction of the major - axis amplitude associated with the settling behavior of @xmath10 can also be gained using the analytical model .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ app : delayed sudden - step model ] the major refinement is change the launch speed corresponding to the initially smaller value of @xmath61 .",
    "although this refinement captures the origin of the @xmath139 reduction of the major axis amplitude , table  [ table : fitresultsa ] shows that the overall agreement with the numerical model is less favorable .",
    "let us now analyze how the macromotion can be quenched . for a one - dimensional , rapidly - oscillating potential it was demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the amplitude of the macromotion can be quenched by an appropriate phase - jump of the modulation field . for the 2d motion in a top ,",
    "the success of such an approach is not _ a priori _ obvious because the phase jumps for the @xmath75- and @xmath19 motion can not be selected independently . yet , as will be shown below , also for the top it is possible to quench both the @xmath69- and @xmath93 amplitudes more or less completely by imposing a single phase jump @xmath140 to the @xmath21 field .    ./fig3.eps    for clarity",
    "we first restrict ourselves to the case @xmath85 and neglect the effects of gravity and switching transients .",
    "this means that the cloud is launched at @xmath52 in the vertical @xmath19 direction with a speed that is equal to @xmath60 , the micromotion speed .",
    "as can be seen from the trajectory depicted at the left of fig.3 the macromotion speed will again be equal to @xmath60 when the cloud returns close to the origin after an integer number of macromotion half - periods .",
    "the total velocity @xmath141 is the vector sum of the micro- and macromotion velocities and this quantity varies rapidly on a time scale of the micro - motion period .",
    "the essence of the quenching procedure is to apply the phase jump at a time @xmath142 chosen in the interval @xmath143 around times @xmath144 corresponding to a multiple of the macromotion half - period .",
    "we choose @xmath142 such that @xmath145 has a magnitude equal to @xmath60 .",
    "when the cloud returns at the @xmath75 axis the micro- and macromotion speeds are both @xmath60 and hence the resultant total velocity can only be equal to @xmath60 if the angle between the macro- and micromotion directions is either @xmath146 or @xmath147 corresponding to two distinct micromotion phases @xmath148 ( see fig.3-right ) . in other words the micro- and macromotion velocity vectors form an equilateral triangle .",
    "for each of these cases a corresponding phase jump exists , @xmath149 respectively , such that @xmath59 is set perpendicular to @xmath145 , which sets the macromotion velocity to zero . the result is pure micromotion if the orbit into which the particle is kicked is centered around the origin . for each of the two choices of @xmath150 ,",
    "pure micromotion results only if the macromotion position at the time of the phase jump is equal to @xmath151 , where the @xmath152 @xmath153 sign applies for even ( odd ) @xmath154 .",
    "complete quenching can be achieved only for specific choices of the ratio @xmath91 .",
    "the change of orbit upon a phase jump is explained pictorially in the middle of fig.3 .",
    "we now generalize to the case where the ratio @xmath91 is not precisely fine tuned and allow for the possibility that the macromotion speed deviates slightly from the value @xmath60 assumed above .",
    "one can show that , also in this case , the maximal reduction in marcromotion energy resulting from a phase jump is achieved when the jump is applied at a time @xmath142 when @xmath155 has a magnitude equal to @xmath60 . the value of @xmath140 is again selected such as to set @xmath59 perpendicular to @xmath145 . by a reasoning similar to the case described above",
    "we find that the condition of an equilateral triangle of the three velocity vectors is now replaced by one that is isosceles - triangle condition with the micro - motion velocity and @xmath145 both having a magnitude @xmath60 .",
    "this in turn means that the magnitude of the phase jump will deviate slightly from the values @xmath156 found above .",
    "also , the nearest distance to the @xmath75 axis at which the isosceles - triangle condition can be met is in general not equal to zero .",
    "this means that some residual macromotion will be present after the phase jump , with an amplitude given by the distance to the origin of the center of the circular orbit into which the cloud is transferred by the phase jump .",
    "one can show that there is always a choice possible where the isosceles - triangle condition is satisfied such that this distance is approximately @xmath157 or less . as a consequence , even in the worst case",
    ", the macromotion amplitude is reduced from @xmath158 to an amplitude of order @xmath61 .",
    "the criterion that the acceleration be set perpendicular to the total velocity at the time that the macromotion speed is equal to @xmath60 can be expressed by the following equation : @xmath159   -\\phi\\left (   t_{a}\\right )   + ( -1)^{k}\\frac{\\pi } { 2 } \\label{eq : phasejump}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are @xmath75- and @xmath19 components of @xmath162 at time @xmath142 and @xmath163 for @xmath164 @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",

    "our experiments corroborate the theoretical model for the top in a quantitative manner .",
    "the macromotion induced by the switch - on and the subsequent possibility to alter this motion by phase jumps have several consequences , some of which we now briefly mention . for example , the sloshing motion may affect the time of flight imaging once the fields have been switched off . when comparing tof - images for different holding times it is in general not sufficient to synchronize the release time to the micromotion period . the position after tof can be easily polluted by the non - zero macromotion , which evolves asynchronously with the micromotion .",

    "the macromotion can be of order of the chemical potential which can have consequences for the stability of the condensate .",
    "the possibility to excite or quench macromotion by phase jumps of the rotating field is a valuable feature of the top trap that has received little attention in the literature .",
    "our work shows that this feature is well understood and can be applied in a well - controlled manner .",
