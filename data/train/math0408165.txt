    "one can extract from this some information of the population covariance matrix even though the sample covariance matrix is not a good approximate .",
    "for example , if there are non - zero eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix well separated from the rest of the eigenvalues , one finds , assuming the gaussian entries , that the samples are not i.i.d ..    there are indeed many cases in which a few eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix are separated from the rest of the eigenvalues , the latter being packed together as in the support of the marchenko - pastur function .",
