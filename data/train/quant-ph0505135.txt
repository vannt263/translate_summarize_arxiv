    "polarization is a fundamental property of light , both in the quantum and in the classical domain . in quantum optics ,",
    "polarization has been mainly examined in the single - photon regime  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , different schemes have been proposed  @xcite and experimentally implemented  @xcite to characterize the continuous - variable limit of the quantum stokes parameters .",
    "we stress that these continuous - variable polarization states can be carried by a bright laser beam providing high bandwidth capabilities and therefore faster signal transfer rates than single photon systems .",
    "in addition , they retain the single - photon advantage of not requiring the universal local oscillator necessary for other proposed continuous variable quantum networks .    since the seminal paper of wigner  @xcite , and the major contributions of moyal  @xcite , stratonovich  @xcite , and berezin  @xcite",
    ", it seems indisputable that phase - space methods , based on using quasidistributions that reflect the noncommutatibility of quantum observables , constitute a valuable tool in examining continuous variables in quantum optics  @xcite .    in particular , these methods have had great success in analyzing one - mode fields ; i. e. , heisenberg - weyl quasidistributions representing the quantum dynamics in the flat @xmath1-@xmath2 ( or , equivalently , @xmath3-@xmath4 ) space .",
    "although not so popular in the quantum - optics community , spinlike systems , with the sphere @xmath5 as phase space , have been also discussed at length in this framework  @xcite .",
    "the resulting functions , naturally related to the su(2 ) dynamical group , have been used to visualize , e. g. , nonclassical properties of a collection of two - level atoms  @xcite .    since the stokes operators can be formally identified with an angular momentum  @xcite",
    ", one may naively expect a direct translation of these su(2 ) quasidistributions to the problem of polarization .",
    "however , this is not the case , mainly because they act on different types of hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "we can then conclude that the problem of an adequate quasiclassical description of polarization of light is still an open question  @xcite .",
    "the stokes operators are a particular case of the schwinger map  @xcite , with two kinematically independent oscillators . in this spirit",
    ", it has been recently shown that the stokes operators are the constants of motion of the two - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "this reflects the fact that the polarization of a classical field can be adequately viewed as the lissajous figure traced out by the end of the electric vector of a monochromatic field  @xcite .",
    "in sharp contrast , in quantum optics the probability distribution for the electric field can be very far from having an elliptical form  @xcite .",
    "we wish to investigate this point from the perspective of quasidistributions .",
    "we show that one can start from the @xmath0-ordered quasidistributions from two kinematically independent oscillators : by eliminating an unessential common phase , we get well - behaved quasidistributions on the poincar sphere .",
    "we apply the resulting family of polarization quasidistributions to some relevant states , and conclude that they constitute an appropriate tool to deal with such a basic variable .",
    "to keep the discussion as self - contained as possible , we first briefly summarize the essential ingredients of phase - space functions for a harmonic oscillator that we shall need for our purposes .    in the hilbert space @xmath6 , the state of the system is fully represented by its density operator @xmath7 . in the phase - space formalism ,",
    "@xmath7 is mapped by a family of functions ( quasidistributions ) @xmath8 onto the classical phase space @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this map is usually implemented by the generalized weyl rule  @xcite @xmath11 , \\ ] ] where the generating kernel @xmath12 fulfill the general properties @xmath13^\\dagger , \\\\   \\\\ \\displaystyle \\int_x d\\mu ( \\alpha ) \\ , \\hat{w}^{(s ) } ( \\alpha ) = \\hat{{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\normalsize\\kern-.33em1 } } } .",

    "the values @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 correspond to the normal , antinormal , and symmetric ordering , respectively , or equivalently to the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 functions .",
    "we stress that these quasidistributions can be determined in practice by using simple and efficient experimental procedures  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they provide a simple measure of the nonclassical behavior of quantum states  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the outstanding case of a harmonic oscillator represented by annihilation and creation operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that obey the canonical commutation relation @xmath22 = \\hat{{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\normalsize\\kern-.33em1 } } } .\\ ] ] the phase space is the complex plane @xmath23 and the invariant measure is @xmath24 .",
    "the operator @xmath25 is the standard displacement operator in the complex plane @xmath26 and leads to introduce the standard coherent states as latexmath:[\\[| \\alpha \\rangle = \\hat{d } ( \\alpha )    state . in this case , the kernel @xmath12 is exactly the cahill - glauber kernel @xmath28 it is often useful to represent this operator in a somewhat different form . after some calculations , it turns out that ( [ wcg ] ) may be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath29 which can also be represented in a disentangled form @xmath30 the reader is referred to e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite to see how this @xmath0-parametrized representation works for some elementary field states .",
    "in classical optics , the superposition of two oscillations of the same angular frequency @xmath31 , one along the horizontal axis @xmath32 and the other along the vertical axis @xmath33 , results in an elliptical motion . this is the simplest lissajous figure and is the basic physics behind the notion of light polarization .    to translate this picture into quantum optics , we assume that the two oscillators are represented by the complex amplitude operators @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , fulfilling ( [ ccr ] ) ; i. e. , @xmath38 = \\delta_{jk } \\hat{{\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small1\\normalsize\\kern-.33em1 } } } \\ , , \\qquad \\qquad j , k = h , v .\\ ] ] in phase space , these oscillators can be appropriately described by the product of the corresponding kernel operators @xmath39 a lissajous figure needs only three independent quantities to be fully characterized : the amplitudes of each oscillator and the relative phase between them .",
    "we therefore introduce the parametrization @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a radial variable related with the global intensity . the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be interpreted as the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , on the poincar sphere @xmath5 . in terms of this parametrization ,",

    "\\hat{u}^{\\dagger}(\\theta,\\phi ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is our central and compact result , that we shall work out in detail in the rest of the paper .",
    "for the antisymmetric ordering @xmath56 , which corresponds to the @xmath18-function , ( [ cenres ] ) reduces to @xmath57 \\ \\hat{u}^{\\dagger}(\\theta , \\phi ) \\ , .\\ ] ] to proceed further we notice that @xmath58 is precisely the projector on the subspace with zero excitations in the vertical mode @xmath33 .",
    "henceforth , we shall denote by @xmath59 excitations in the horizontal mode @xmath32 and @xmath60 in the vertical mode @xmath33 . in view of ( [ proj ] )",
    "we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the standard su(2 ) coherent states  @xcite @xmath63 the @xmath18 function generated by this kernel reads as @xmath64 = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } ( n + 1 ) \\",
    "q(n,\\theta,\\phi ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 the normalization condition @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the differential of solid angle , is automatically fulfilled .    equation ( [ q1 ] ) is a well - known result , which may be derived from a variety of methods . the point we wish to stress is here that ( [ q1 ] ) involves only diagonal elements between states with the same number of excitations . because of the lack of the off - diagonal contributions of the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 , the @xmath18 function takes the form of an average over the subspaces with definite total number of excitations .",
    "the role of the sum in @xmath70 is to remove the total intensity from the description of the state .",
    "we next pass to the symmetrical order ( @xmath71 ) , which corresponds to the wigner function . from ( [ cenres ] )",
    "we immediately get @xmath72 \\ \\hat{u}^\\dagger ( \\theta , \\phi ) .\\ ] ] to properly transform the operator in brackets , it proves convenient to introduce the following operators @xmath73 which constitute the schwinger map for two independent oscillators  @xcite and are the generators of the group su(2 ) . since @xmath74 is an element of su(2 ) , it can be represented as  @xcite @xmath75 next , we note that @xmath76 and that @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is a unit vector on the sphere @xmath5",
    ". then , equation  ( [ wop ] ) simplifies to @xmath80 this wigner function will be examined for a variety of states in the next section .",
    "however , it seems pertinent to compare before these results with previous approaches using the machinery of su(2 ) quasidistributions .",
    "one can immediately check that both give the same @xmath18 function , meanwhile the corresponding wigner functions are different .",
    "once again , the symmetrical order is extraordinarily sensitive to any fingerprint of nonclassical behavior . without going into mathematical details",
    ", we merely quote that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the su(2 ) wigner kernel can be represented as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an operator whose expression is of little interest for our purposes here .",
    "it turns out , however , that in the asymptotic case of large dimensions of the representation ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 tends to the parity operator on the sphere : @xmath85 .",
    "the su(2 ) wigner function coincides thus with ( [ wop ] ) , except for the factor the appears premultiplying , which does not play any relevant role .",
    "so , in the classical limit , both approaches give the same result .",
    "nevertheless , we mention that the su(2 ) quasidistributions have been not determined experimentally yet , at difference of the easy measurability of the @xmath0-ordered quasidistributions for the single polarization modes .",
    "we finally note that the operator ( [ wop ] ) , when restricted to a single su(2 ) invariant subspace , does not contain complete information : in other words , it can not be inverted to obtain the density matrix .",
    "to gain further insights into this formalism , we shall particularize the wigner function ( [ wop ] ) for several states of interest . for simplicity , we assume a pure state @xmath86 , so that the wigner function is simply @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88    we recall that , for fixed @xmath70 , the states @xmath89 @xmath90 ) span a @xmath91-dimensional invariant subspace , wherein the action of the operators ( [ gensu2 ] ) is standard . in consequence , we expand @xmath86 in this basis @xmath92 so that the action of @xmath93 on @xmath94 can be easily calculated .",
    "the resulting wigner function takes the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the wigner @xmath97 function @xmath98 whose properties have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "using such properties and after some lengthy , but otherwise straightforward calculations , we finally get @xmath99 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\psi_{nm } \\psi_{nn}^\\ast \\ , e^{i\\phi ( m - n ) } \\ , d_{nm}^{n}(-2\\theta ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be checked that @xmath100 is properly normalized @xmath101    we first consider the case of ( quadrature ) coherent states @xmath102 we take both oscillators with the same amplitude and relative phase @xmath103 ; i.e. , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this is perhaps the most interesting situation as polarization is concerned .",
    "the decomposition in invariant subspaces reads @xmath106 note that this state is separable and @xmath107 is just the product of the photon - number amplitudes in each polarization mode . the sums in ( [ wfin ] ) can be carried out explicitly , with the result @xmath108 + 1 \\right \\ } \\exp \\left \\ { -2 r^2 [ 1- \\sin \\theta \\cos",
    "( \\phi + \\varphi ) ] \\right \\ } .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to examine how the quantum character of the state reflects itself in the properties of the wigner function , we plot the distribution  @xcite @xmath109 on the unit sphere .",
    "notice that , with our parametrization , if the unit vector @xmath110 points in the positive direction @xmath111 , @xmath112 , or @xmath113 the state is right - circularly , linearly at 45@xmath114 , or horizontally polarized light , respectively . in fig .  1 we have plotted the normalized probability distribution @xmath115 for the coherent case , with @xmath116 and the relative phase @xmath117 , which classically corresponds to circularly polarized light .",
    "what we see in the figure is indeed a gaussian distribution centered at the corresponding classical point .",
    "next we consider coherent squeezed states in both polarization modes . in consequence",

    "the complex number @xmath122 is known as the squeezing parameter and is usually expressed @xmath123 : while @xmath124 measures the squeezing of the fluctuations , @xmath125 measures the direction in which such a squeezing takes place .",

    "apart from a small deformation of the sphere , we see two symmetrical peaks with elliptical contours that indeed represent squeezing of the fluctuations .    to give another simple but illustrative example",
    ", we consider a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath133 and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are defined as in equation ( [ munu ] ) .",

    "3 we have plotted the normalized distribution corresponding to a two - mode squeezed vacuum with @xmath138 .",
    "we see the presence of two gaussian cups centered at the north and south poles and also a belt around the equator of the unit sphere .",
    "this state can be seen as arising mainly from these contributions and is rotationally symmetric , as ( [ wtwom ] ) is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we consider the propagation of light in a kerr medium . if initially both polarization modes are in coherent states of amplitudes @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the state at time @xmath141 can be written as  @xcite @xmath142 and @xmath143 , @xmath144 being a real parameter proportional to the third - order nonlinear susceptibility of the medium",
    ". the state ( [ cat ] ) is entangled , and its expansion ( [ decinvsub ] ) can be easily worked out @xmath145    the presence of the quadratic phase in ( [ psikerr ] ) prevents again from obtaining an analytical form for the wigner function . in fig .",
    "4 we show the normalized distribution on the sphere for a coherent amplitude @xmath146 equal in both polarization modes and @xmath147 .",
    "the complicated phase dynamics predicted by the theory manifests itself in a complex pattern of well resolved peaks .    in summary , what we expect to have accomplished in this paper is to present a simple alternative phase - space formalism for polarization on the poincar sphere , based on @xmath0-ordered quasidistributions for the two basic polarization modes .",
    "these results may have interesting experimental consequences in order to implement a feasible experimental procedure for determining polarization properties ."
