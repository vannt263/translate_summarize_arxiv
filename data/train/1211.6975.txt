    "two additional important properties of light propagation are highlighted by fresnel s theory @xcite .",
    "first , only the lower order fresnel zones contribute efficiently to the disturbance .",
    "second , the contribution of the first zone alone to the disturbance at @xmath18 is in absolute value twice the overall disturbance itself ; the irradiance at @xmath18 due to the first zone , if it can be separated from the contribution of the other zones , is four times the total irradiance .",
    "these properties imply that for eq .",
    "[ eq : sca ] to hold it is enough for the cloud to match an huygens sphere over a few fresnel zones only .",
    "they also mean that the scattered irradiance may be estimated from the scattering by the first fresnel zone alone , and that adding the disturbances from a larger number of zones diminishes but does not destroy the contribution of the first zone ( unless the cloud matches exactly an even number of fresnel s zones ) .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath43 are large the irradiance due to scattering by the whole cloud should be one fourth the irradiance @xmath44 in the idealized situation of a cloud confined to the first fresnel zone .",

    "eq .  [ eq : i1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : r2 ] differ by a factor 6.6 , close to the factor of 4 anticipated previously .",
    "the difference should be attributed to the fact that the phase lags between atoms in the first fresnel zone have been neglected .      for a cloud 100  pc  @xmath55  cm away and a star at infinity ( for instance in another galaxy ) , the first fresnel zone for @xmath56    is @xmath57  km large .",
    "the amplification of the scattered light in the forward direction , with respect to what it would be if coherence of the scattered waves was ignored , is then a factor @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "if the star is at equal distance from the cloud as the observer is ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 is divided by two , and the irradiance @xmath51 due to the scattered starlight is reduced by a factor of 4 only .",
    "it nevertheless remains very large .    in the expression",
    "@xmath62 the @xmath63 term contributes most to the scattered light when @xmath61 is large ( the cloud is far from both the star and the observer ) because of the large number of scatterers and their cooperative effect ; @xmath48 is then minimum .",
    "conversely @xmath48 will be enhanced when the scatterers are close to the star or to the observer ( because of the @xmath64 dependence of @xmath65 , eq .",
    "[ eq : i0 ] ) , while the size of the fresnel zone , and thereby coherent scattering , is reduced .",
    "coherent scattering and scattering by one particle have opposite effects which compensate for each other .",
    "but for stars close to a cloud the curvature of the huygens - fresnel sphere is increased and the identification of the sphere with the cloud will be more difficult ; in addition the coherence of the scattered waves within the cloud thickness will tend to disappear .",
    "the effect of coherent scattering will be lost and eq .",
    "[ eq : sca ] can no more be applied . in this case",
    "the scattered light irradiance should be calculated using classical incoherent scattering .",
    "it is negligible compared to the star irradiance @xmath66 .",
    "only coherent scattering from large fresnel zones can lead to an appreciable amount of scattered starlight in the sense discussed in the previous sections .",
    "for a given observer - cloud distance this will happen for stars sufficiently far - away from the cloud .",

    "if @xmath83 @xmath84 the scattered waves remain coherent over the thickness @xmath19 of the cloud as long as @xmath85 is less than half the wavelength , that is over @xmath86 fresnel zones .",
    "the irradiance at @xmath18 of light scattered by the whole cloud has the same order of magnitude as if the cloud was localized in the first fresnel zone .",

    "this is physically justified by the fact that the power extinguished within the slab tends to infinity .",
    "we also tried to investigate possible limitations of van de hulst s formula ( eq .  [ eq : vdh1 ] ) . in the introduction of his chapter 4",
    "van de hulst indicates , with no further justification , that the derivations made along the chapter hold as long as the average distance between the particles remains large compared to the wavelength .",
    "we did not find the reason why it should be so , why classical scattering theory would nt apply in standard laboratory conditions , why if @xmath98 atoms were to be localized in the first fresnel zone the irradiance of the scattered light would not be given by @xmath99 times the irradiance due to one atom ?",

    "this paper is based on a formula ( eq .  [ eq : vdh1 ] ) which provides the irradiance of a plane wave scattered by a slab of identical , spherically symmetric , particles , in the forward direction and at the position of an observer far - away from the slab .",
    "the formula in itself presents no special difficulty .",
    "it may be obtained by different methods , through direct integration over all the particles in the slab ( as it was first derived by van de hulst in 1957 ) , or using the convenient and more visual framework of the huygens - fresnel theory .",

    "may need to be refined and its conditions of application evaluated in a more precise way than we did .",
    "but it does suggest the possibility for the image of a star to appear brighter when observed behind a cloud of hydrogen than it would be without the cloud on the line of sight .",
    "the cloud , rather than acting as a screen , behaves as a lens and enhances the irradiance of the light coming from the direction of the star .",
    "the scattering of starlight by an interstellar cloud was the major focus of this paper .",
    "we have shown that this problem is equivalent to the coherent scattering from the first fresnel zone .",
