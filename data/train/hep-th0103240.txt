    "in two recent papers randall and sundrum @xcite have shown that a scenario with an infinite fifth dimension in the presence of a brane can generate a theory of gravity which mimics purely four - dimensional gravity , both with respect to the classical gravitational potential and with respect to gravitational radiation .",
    "the gravitational self - couplings are not significantly modified in this model .",
    "this result has been obtained from the study of a single @xmath0-brane embedded in five dimensions , with the @xmath1 metric given by @xmath2 , which can produce a large hierarchy between the scale of particle physics and gravity due to the appearance of the warp factor .",
    "even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard @xmath3 gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "in contrast to the compactified case , this follows because the near - brane geometry traps the massless graviton .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a @xmath4-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time .",
    "the randall - sundrum model was inspired by superstring theory .",
    "the ten - dimensional @xmath5 heterotic string theory , which contains the standard model of elementary particle , could be a promising candidate for the description of the real universe .",
    "this theory is connected with an eleven - dimensional theory , m - theory , compactified on the orbifold @xmath6 @xcite . in this model",
    "we have two separated ten - dimensional manifolds .",
    "the static randall - sundrum solution has been extended to time - dependent solutions and their cosmological properties have been extensively studied in papers too many to cite them all @xcite ( for a recent review of dynamics and geometry of brane universes see @xcite ) . in one of the first cosmological applications of this scenario it was pointed out that a model with a non - compact fifth dimension is potentially viable , while the scenario which might solve the hierarchy problem predicts a contracting universe , leading to a variety of cosmological problems @xcite . by adding cosmological constants to the brane and bulk",
    ", the problem of the correct behavior of the hubble parameter on the brane has been solved by cline , grojean and servant @xcite . as a result one also obtains normal expansion during nucleosynthesis , but faster than normal expansion in the very early universe .",
    "the creation of a spherically symmetric brane - world in ads bulk has been considered , from a quantum cosmological point of view , with the use of the wheeler - de witt equation , by anchordoqui , nuez and olsen @xcite .",
    "the effective gravitational field equations on the brane world , in which all the matter forces except gravity are confined on the @xmath0-brane in a @xmath4-dimensional space - time with @xmath7-symmetry have been obtained , by using an elegant geometric approach , by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki @xcite . the correct signature for gravity",
    "is provided by the brane with positive tension .",
    "if the bulk space - time is exactly anti - de sitter , generically the matter on the brane is required to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "the electric part of the @xmath4-dimensional weyl tensor @xmath8 gives the leading order corrections to the conventional einstein equations on the brane .",
    "the four - dimensional field equations for the induced metric and scalar field on the world - volume of a @xmath0-brane in the five - dimensional bulk with einstein gravity plus a self - interacting scalar field have been derived by maeda and wands @xcite .",
    "the effective four - dimensional einstein equations include terms due to scalar fields and gravitational waves in the bulk .    from a general theoretical point of view brane cosmological models",
    "are two - measure theories , since they have two independent lagrangians , one associated to the brane , the other associated to the bulk .",
    "an other two measure theory has been proposed by guendelman @xcite , in which the energy - momentum tensor is also a non - linear function of the general - relativistic energy - momentum tensor .",
    "due to the scale invariance , the true vacuum state has zero energy density , when the theory is analyzed in the conformal einstein frame .",
    "field theory models , constructed in a gravitational theory where a measure of integration @xmath9 in the action is not necessary @xmath10 , but is determined dynamically through additional degrees of freedom , have been presented in @xcite . in this type of theory",
    "it is possible to combine the solution of the cosmological constant problem with the possibility of inflation and spontaneously broken gauge unified theories .",
    "the models with global scale invariance allow for non - trivial scalar field potentials and masses for particles , so that the scale symmetry must be broken .",
    "the conserved quantities have been obtained by guendelman @xcite , who showed that the infrared behavior of the conserved currents is singular , so there are no conserved charges associated with scale symmetry ( which implies that in some high field region the potentials become flat ) . for closed strings and branes ( including the supersymmetric case ) the modified measure formulation is possible and does not require the introduction of a particular scale ( the string or brane tension ) from the beginning , but rather these appears as integration constants @xcite .",
    "the linearized perturbation equations in the generalized randall - sundrum model have been obtained , by using the covariant nonlinear dynamical equations for the gravitational and matter fields on the brane , by maartens @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal energy density determines the tidal acceleration in the off - brane direction and can oppose singularity formation via the generalized raychaudhuri equation .",
    "isotropy of the cosmic microwave background may no longer guarantee a friedmann - robertson - walker geometry .",
    "vorticity on the brane decays as in general relativity , but nonlocal bulk effects can source the gravitomagnetic field , so that vector perturbations can also be generated in the absence of vorticity .    the behavior of an anisotropic bianchi type i brane - world in the presence of inflationary scalar fields has been considered by maartens , sahni and saini @xcite . according to their results the magnitude of the anisotropy parameter of the brane does not affect inflation , a large initial anisotropy introducing more damping into the scalar field equation of motion .",
    "inflation at high energies proceeds at a higher rate than the corresponding rate in general relativity . by numerical integration of field equations",
    "it is also found that anisotropy always disappear within a fixed interval of time , no matter what its initial value .",
    "the shear dynamics in bianchi type i cosmological model on a brane with a perfect fluid has been studied in @xcite . for @xmath11",
    "the shear has a maximum at some moment during a transition period from non - standard to standard cosmology , when the matter energy density is comparable to the brane tension .    a systematic analysis , using dynamical systems techniques , of the qualitative behavior of the bianchi type i and v cosmological models in the randall - sundrum brane world scenario , with matter on the brane obeying a barotropic equation of state @xmath12 , has been performed by campos and sopuerta @xcite . in particular",
    ", they constructed the state spaces for these models and discussed what new critical points appear , the occurrence of bifurcations and the dynamics of the anisotropy . expanding bianchi type i and v",
    "brane - worlds always isotropize , although there could be intermediate stages in which the anisotropy grows . near the big - bang the anisotropy dominates for @xmath13 , in opposition to the general relativistic situation when it dominates for @xmath14 .",
    "frolov @xcite has shown that the geometrical construction of the randall and sundrum brane world can be carried out , without the assumption of spatial isotropy , by means of an homogeneous and anisotropic kasner type solution of the einstein - ads equations in the bulk .",
    "the brane equations of motion in this anisotropic space - time are solved by a static brane configuration , with the geometry of the @xmath0-brane given by the @xmath3 kasner solution .",
    "the set of sufficient conditions , which must be satisfied by the brane matter and bulk metric so that a homogeneous and anisotropic brane asymptotically evolves to a de sitter space - time in presence of a positive cosmological constant have been derived in @xcite . in the presence of a non - local energy density and/or a strong anisotropic stress ( i.e. a magnetic field ) , a bianchi type",
    "i brane , even initially expanding , is unstable and may collapse .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate some classes of exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in the brane world model for the anisotropic bianchi type i and v geometries , for a conformally flat bulk ( with vanishing weyl tensor ) . for a perfect cosmological fluid obeying a linear barotropic equation of state",
    ", the general solution of the field equations can be obtained in an exact parametric form , for arbitrary @xmath15 or in an exact analytic form for a stiff fluid .",
    "the inclusion of the quadratic terms in the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect cosmological fluids leads to major changes in the early dynamics of the anisotropic universe , as compared to the standard general relativistic case .",
    "we also consider the dynamics of the scalar fields on the brane for different scalar field potentials of physical interest .",
    "the behavior of the observationally important physical quantities like anisotropy , shear and deceleration parameters is considered in detail for all these models .    the present paper is organized as follows . the field equations on the brane are written down in section ii . in section iii we present the general solution of the field equations for the bianchi type i geometry with a perfect cosmological fluid .",
