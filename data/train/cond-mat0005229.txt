    "direct band a@xmath0b@xmath1 semiconductors are very challenging both for theoretical and experimental applications .",
    "in particular , heterostructures based on these compounds are widely studied .",
    "there have been published many papers devoted to the boundary condition problem in heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "these articles mainly dealt with abrupt interface potentials , where appropriate boundary conditions were sought to relate the wave functions at the different sides of the interface .",
    "the most common approach used to find the boundary conditions is to integrate envelope function equations through the interface  @xcite . in this way",
    ", it appears that there is no mixing between light and heavy holes at normal incidence  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no general reason justifying the integration procedure .",
    "moreover , the tight binding model and some numerical calculations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) are in direct contradiction with the above statement . in particular , for a gaas / alas interface the light - heavy hole transformation coefficient for the normal incident flux was found to be of order unity  @xcite . in a purely phenomenological analysis , relying on group theoretical formalism  @xcite , the boundary conditions were found to be determined by a number of phenomenological parameters which should be found either from microscopical calculations or from fitting to experimental data",
    ". however , this approach hardly allows following the dynamics of the reflection matrix as a function of energy and lateral momentum of incident holes . on the other hand",
    "there is possible a completely different situation wherein the potential near the turning point is smooth .",
    "the boundary of this type may appear either in a compound with relatively slow variation of composition or in a structure subjected to an external electric field .",
    "smoothness of the potential justifies use of the envelope function equations and hence eliminates boundary condition uncertainties .",
    "the formulation of the problem suggests that the semiclassical approach is to be used .",
    "however , being applied to luttinger equations , it gives new essential features as compared to standard wkb formulas .",
    "the situation of a smooth linear potential was first considered in  @xcite for a gapless system , and later , in  @xcite , for the case of a@xmath0b@xmath1 semiconductors . in the latter paper , it was shown that there is a light - heavy hole transformation even in a slow varying potential if the incident particle flux is not normal to the interface . in their calculation , the authors used an infinitely large heavy hole mass , which resulted in divergence of the wavefunction in a certain underbarrier point at which the kinetic energy of a hole was equal to zero . in the present paper",
    "we take the ratio of heavy and light hole masses to be large but finite and avoid divergences of this type .",
    "we note finally that though we assume that the hole masses and spin - orbital splitting do nt depend on the coordinate , their slow linear variations can be easily included into the model .",
    "let us start from the conventional @xmath2 hamiltonian in a spherical band approximation , i.e. assuming that the luttinger parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are equal to each other  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is usually well justified in the vicinity of @xmath5-point . instead of total angular momentum basis",
    ", we use another one  @xcite @xmath6+i{\\delta_{so}\\over 3 } [ { \\bf \\sigma}\\times{\\bf \\psi}]=0 , \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are generalized luttinger parameters  @xcite , @xmath9 is the kane parameter having dimension of velocity , @xmath10 is a free electron mass , @xmath11 are pauli matrices , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the band gap and spin - orbital splitting , @xmath14 is the external potential which will be considered hereafter to be a linear function of @xmath15-coordinate : @xmath16 .",
    "we use the units where plank constant is equal to unity .",
    "the equation above is a generalization of that suggested in  @xcite to the case of a finite heavy hole mass .",
    "obviously the wave function is to be found as a plain wave propagating along the lateral directions multiplied by a function of @xmath15 coordinate : @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spinors . without loss of generality",
    "choose @xmath21 .",
    "we further simplify our calculations assuming that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are much larger than @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath24 model  @xcite .",
    "then ( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes :    @xmath25\\\\ \\mp i\\left[{{d^2\\over d x^2}-q^2\\over 2m_h } \\mp{3q(m_h - m_{lh})\\over 4m_h m_{lh}}{d\\over d x}+\\alpha x- e \\right ] & { 1\\over m_h}{d^2\\over d x^2 } -{q^2(m_{lh}+3m_h)\\over 4m_h m_{lh}}+2\\alpha x-2e \\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\psi_x(x)\\\\ \\psi_y(x)\\end{array } \\right ) = 0 \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are heavy and light hole effective masses related to luttinger parameters as : @xmath28 the upper sign in ( [ eq:2 ] ) corresponds to the spinor satisfying : @xmath29 while the lower does to : @xmath30 obviously the two sets of solutions are obtained form each other via the time reversal transformation : @xmath31 and @xmath32",

    "note that @xmath55 is not unitary and it depends only on a single parameter @xmath56 .",
    "let us proceed with the analysis of ( [ main ] ) for the case of large @xmath56 .",
    "it appears that in this limit solving this equation is similar to finding a superbarrier reflection coefficient in ordinary quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "this analogy suggest shifting the variable @xmath57 from the real axis .",
    "for positive @xmath56 we substitute : @xmath58 yielding : @xmath59 the boundary condition corresponding to the incident light hole is : @xmath60 provided @xmath61 , ( [ main1 ] ) simplifies to : @xmath62 the solution to this equation , which is formally can be expressed through whittaker functions , is most conveniently given via the integral representation : @xmath63 the particular choice of a multiplier before the integral ensures coincidence of ( [ eq:18 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) in the region @xmath64 .",
    "this can be verified by applying the steepest descend integration to ( [ eq:18 ] ) . in the region",
    "@xmath65 we find asymptotics corresponding to @xmath47 and @xmath46 . however , as noted above the @xmath46 coefficient must be set to be @xmath66 and not the value obtained in our manipulation .",
    "in fact loss of accuracy for some branches of a solution is quite common when asymptotical expressions are extended into the complex plain . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath47 coefficient is found with exponential accuracy : @xmath67 where @xmath5 denotes the @xmath5-function .",
    "if @xmath56 is large and negative , one has to shift variable to @xmath68 .",
    "coming through the same steps we can get : @xmath69    in a similar fashion we can provide analysis for small values of @xmath56 .",
    "as will be clear later it is sufficient to restrict calculations only to the case @xmath70 .",
    "then ( [ main ] ) has two simple solutions : @xmath71 where @xmath72 stands for the principal value of the integral .",
    "the coefficients before @xmath73 and @xmath74 are chosen in the way that at @xmath75 these functions coincide with the defined above asymptotics of the light and heavy holes respectively .",

    "provided @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath83    here @xmath84 is a classical turning point and @xmath85 is a position - dependent light hole wavevector : @xmath86    similarly we can deduce semiclassical wave functions valid for @xmath87 . the only difference , which appears as compared to ( [ eq:50 ] ) is the absence of ( @xmath88 ) in the argument of cosine .",
    "we note that at @xmath89 expressions ( [ eq:24 ] ) and ( [ eq:25 ] ) diverge at @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , as was noted in  @xcite , this phenomenon is closely related to the divergence of the electric field in electromagnetic waves incident to the media with linearly increasing dielectric constant  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the system ( [ eq:15 ] ) is equivalent to the fourth order differential equation with a small coefficient at a higher derivative . and the equations under consideration have precisely the form of the maxwell equations for the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is analogous to the coupling between plasmons and the electromagnetic field . in other words ,",
    "the effect of heavy holes on the light hole wave functions is similar to account of spatial dependence of dielectric constant in plasma .",
    "however , in order to get a sharp resonance , @xmath91 should be very small . for real semiconductors its value",
    "is usually bounded between @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which appears to be insufficient to observe the peak . on the contrary , for plasma the corresponding quantity ( @xmath94 ) is several orders of magnitude less  @xcite , and hence the resonance can exist",
    ".    in a similar manner wkb wave functions for the heavy holes can be found .",
    "thus for @xmath79 in a classically allowed region we get :    @xmath95    where @xmath96    note that the turning point for heavy holes ( @xmath97 ) is closer to the origin then that for the light holes as should be expected .    the next step in our analysis is to relate the @xmath55-matrix in momentum space defined in ( [ eq:19 ] ) to the @xmath98-matrix in real space . to do this we have to define the basis functions for the incident and reflected waves .",
    "like we have observed already , it is convenient to work in the @xmath99 representation for the light holes and @xmath100 representation for the heavy holes .",
    "@xmath101    where @xmath102 refer to the incoming and outgoing waves .",

    "the choice of the basis functions ( [ eq:30 ] ) and ( [ eq:30b ] ) is now evident , since they carry out equal fluxes .",
    "now it is not hard to relate the @xmath98 and @xmath55 matricies : @xmath106 the unitarity condition for @xmath98 requires that @xmath107 where we neglected by @xmath91 compared to @xmath66 .",
    "all other relations are just a consequence of ( [ eq:31 ] ) , in particular : @xmath108    using ( [ eq:18b ] ) , ( [ eq:18c ] ) and ( [ eq:32 ] ) we can find the approximate expression for the light - heavy hole transformation coefficient @xmath109 valid for large @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath110 at small @xmath56 , from ( [ eq:40 ] ) and ( [ eq:32 ] ) we obtain : @xmath111 using asymptotics ( [ eq:28 ] ) , ( [ eq:28a ] ) and ( [ eq:29 ] ) as well as the exact numerical results it is possible to find an interpolating function which gives an excellent description of @xmath109 for all values of @xmath56 ( see figure 1 ) : @xmath112",
    "from the expression ( [ eq:38 ] ) it follows that the light - heavy hole transformation coefficient vanishes both in the limit of small and large @xmath56 .",
    "the maximums occur at @xmath56 close to @xmath113 , see figure 1 .",
    "note that the maximum reflection coefficient at positive @xmath56 is much larger than that at negative .",
    "an important result is that the dependence of the reflection matrix @xmath98 ( and transformation coefficient @xmath114 in particular ) on the dimensionless longitudinal momentum @xmath56 is not sensitive to the ratio of the light and heavy hole masses .",
    "also the potential slope completely scales out and the crossover from small to large @xmath115 occurs even in the case of a very slow varying potential .",
    "[ fig1 ]   on @xmath56 , obtained from numerical solution of ( [ main ] ) - solid line , and the approximate expressions ( [ eq:38a ] ) , ( [ eq:38 ] ) - dotted line .",
    "the insert shows the relative phase of the light hole reflection coefficient @xmath116.,title=\"fig:\",width=325,height=245 ]    in the insert of fig .",
    "1 we plot the phase of the light hole reflection coefficient .",
    "it is equal to the conventional value for large @xmath56 .",
    "the discontinuity of the phase at @xmath70 is due to inclusion of @xmath117 into the basis functions ( [ eq:30 ] ) and ( [ eq:30b ] ) .",
    "similar curve but with the opposite sign is valid for the heavy holes .    now let us compare transformation coefficient studied in this paper with that obtained for a scattering on an abrupt potential .",
    "there is no unique and justified approach to derive the boundary conditions for envelope functions  @xcite .",
    "however , for the infinite barrier the most natural and used requirement is the vanishing of wave function components at the interface ( see for example refs  @xcite ) . using these boundary conditions and basis functions ( [ eq:30 ] ) and ( [ eq:30b ] ) with @xmath118 and @xmath119 being constants independent of @xmath15",
    ", it is not hard to derive reflection matrix for the scattering from an infinite abrupt potential .",
    "in particular one finds : @xmath120 introducing the incidence angle for the light holes : @xmath121 and using @xmath122 we get : @xmath123 in a more general case of nonspherical band ( @xmath124 ) light and heavy hole transformation coefficients were numerically investigated in  @xcite .",
    "expression ( [ eq:51 ] ) , contrary to ( [ eq:38 ] ) , has explicit dependence on @xmath91 .",
    "it vanishes in both limits of normal and lateral incident light hole .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , use of vanishing at interface boundary conditions is controversial and needs further justification .",
    "note that the reflection matrix from a linear smooth potential is found without making any specific assumptions about semiconductors .",
    "so the result of the present analysis is quite general and does nt depend on microscopical details .",
    "[ fig2 ]   as a function of @xmath15-coordinate for the case of the incident light hole .",
    "the top graphs refer to the large mixing between the hole branches ( @xmath125 ) and the bottom graphs do to the small mixing ( @xmath126).,title=\"fig:\",width=160,height=122 ]   as a function of @xmath15-coordinate for the case of the incident light hole .",

    "the top graphs refer to the large mixing between the hole branches ( @xmath125 ) and the bottom graphs do to the small mixing ( @xmath126).,title=\"fig:\",width=160,height=122 ]    figure 2 shows the wave functions for the incident light hole for two different values of @xmath56 corresponding to large and small mixing between the two hole branches .",
    "high frequency oscillations correspond to the heavy hole component , which is obviously essential for @xmath125 and relatively small for @xmath126 .",
    "note that as was mentioned earlier at @xmath89 there appears a sharp resonance in the wave function near @xmath127 .",
    "however it is hardly seen in the graphs .",
    "the reason is that the height of the peak , as it follows from ( [ eq:24 ] , [ eq:25 ] ) , is of the order @xmath128 and the peak itself exists only when @xmath79 .",
    "real values of @xmath91 for the semiconductors are not less then @xmath92 , which is insufficient for observing the resonance .    in conclusion ,",
    "the light - heavy hole transformation coefficient for reflection from a linear potential is found to be a function of a dimensionless parameter @xmath56 , which is proportional to the longitudinal momentum of the light holes , and to be independent of the ratio of the light and heavy hole masses if this ratio is small .",
    "this function vanishes in both limits of large and small @xmath56 , however the phases of light - light and heavy - heavy hole reflection coefficients are different in these limits .",
    "an approximate analytical expression for the transformation coefficient is found ( see ( [ eq:38 ] ) ) .",
    "account of the finite heavy hole mass is shown to be responsible for disappearance of an underbarrier resonance in the light hole wave function predicted in  @xcite .",
