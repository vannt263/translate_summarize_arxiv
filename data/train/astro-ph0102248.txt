    "cluster mergers are the most energetic and common phenomena in the universe , leading to an energy release of @xmath0 ergs on a timescale of the order of gyrs .",
    "however , it is still unclear how this enormous energy release is dissipated . while the effects of merging on the large scale properties of the hot intracluster medium ( shocks , gradients in the temperature and changes in the gas distribution profiles ) seem to be reasonably well understood",
    "( see for example roettiger , burns & loken 1996 ) , a key question is whether it has important consequences also on the galaxy population properties .",
    "bekki ( 1999 ) suggested that merging could be important in driving gas towards the centres of galaxies and , therefore , in fuelling the star formation .",
    "owen et al . ( 1999 ) , in a comparative study of the two clusters a2125 and a2645 , suggested that cluster merging could be responsible both for the high fraction of blue ( i.e. star - forming ) galaxies and for the excess in the radio source population in a2125 .",
    "in order to explore in detail the astrophysical consequencies of merging on galaxy radio emission , venturi et al .",
    "( 2000 , paper iii in this series ) carried out a detailed multifrequency study of the a3558 cluster complex , at the centre of the shapley concentration .",
    "this structure is formed by three abell clusters and two poor groups .",
    "bardelli et al .",
    "( 1998b ) suggested that it is the remnant of a cluster - cluster collision , seen just after the first core - core encounter .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the dynamical state of clusters ( bardelli et al .",
    "1998a ) and by a filament of hot gas connecting the clusters ( bardelli et al .",
    "1994 , kull & bhringer 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , there is marginal evidence of an excess of blue galaxies at the expected shock position .",
    "substructure analysis ( bardelli et al .",
    "1998b ) and the detailed dynamical study of a possible relic source ( venturi et al .",
    "1998 , paper ii ) show that this complex is far from a relaxed state .",
    "rather unexpectedly , the bivariate radio - optical luminosity function of the a3558 complex shows a significant deficiency of radio sources in comparison with the cluster sample studied by ledlow & owen 1996 ( hereinafter lo96 ) , suggesting that merging may have  switched - off \" pre - existing radio sources .",
    "these results suggest that the role of cluster mergers on the radio properties of galaxies is not well understood yet , and other parameters , such as , for example , the evolutionary stage of the merger and the initial conditions ( such as for example cluster masses ) are likely to play a major role .",
    "very few merging clusters are as well studied at optical , x  ray and radio wavelengths as done for the a3558 complex , therefore it is of crucial importance to increase their number , in order to throw light on such a complex phenomenon and better understand the relation between cluster mergers and the radio properties of galaxies . with this aim in mind , we surveyed another region of merging clusters in the core of the shapley concentration , dominated by a3528 .",
    "this structure is formed by the aco ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) clusters a3528 , a3530 , a3532 and a3535 .",
    "these clusters have been observed with rosat ( schindler 1996 ; henriksen & jones 1996 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ) ; moreover , bardelli , zucca & baldi ( 2000 ) performed a redshift survey of @xmath1 galaxies in order to determine the dynamics of the complex .",
    "we observed the complex simultaneously at 22 cm and 13 cm with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "we covered the whole region , an area of @xmath2 deg@xmath3 in the sky . in this paper , the fourth of a series of papers dedicated to this study , we present the results of our observations . in section 2 we summarize the global properties of the abell clusters in this region ; in section 3 we describe the observations , data reduction and give a catalogue of the radio sources ; optical identifications for the detected sources are also presented in this section .",
    "the properties of the extended radio galaxies in the a3528 complex are given in section 4 ; our statistical analysis and conclusions are given in section 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "as in previous papers in this series , we assume a hubble constant h@xmath4 = 100 h km s@xmath5mpc@xmath5 . at the average redshift of the shapley concentration , @xmath6 , @xmath7 = 0.67 kpc",
    "the a3528 cluster complex is a group of galaxy clusters located in the core of the shapley concentration , northwest of the a3558 complex , the dominant structure of the supercluster , and it is formed by the three aco clusters a3528 , a3530 , a3532 .",
    "it is at an average redshift of @xmath8 ( @xmath9  16000 km s@xmath5 ) and has an elongation of @xmath9 @xmath10 in the north - south direction ( @xmath9 8 h@xmath5 mpc ) .",
    "the poor cluster a3535 , located northeast of a3528 , although close in projection to the other clusters of the complex , is at a larger redshift , i.e. @xmath11 ( @xmath9 20000 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : a3528 ] shows the isodensity contours of the distribution of the optical galaxies with magnitude b@xmath12 19.5 ; the levels have been chosen in order to highlight the clusters .",
    "the figure shows two interesting features : a ) the distance between the centres of a3530 and a3532 is smaller than their abell radii , an indication at least of tidal interactions ; b ) the contours of a3528 appear to be elongated in the north - south direction , pointing toward the a3530-a3532 system . a substructure analysis done by bardelli ,",
    "baldi & zucca ( 2000 ) led to the conclusion that the whole chain is in a very complex dynamical state .",
    "table 1 summarizes the most important features of the three clusters : in columns 1 , 2 and 3 we give respectively name and j2000 coordinates ; in column 4 the bautz - morgan type and richness ; columns 5 and 6 show the mean heliocentric velocity and velocity dispersion ; mass , x  ray luminosity and gas temperature are reported respectively in columns 7 , 8 and 9 .",
    "=    a3528 is the dominant cluster in this region , with richness class 1 ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) and a cd galaxy with b@xmath13 = 13.6 located at its centre .",
    "x - ray observations ( raychaudhury et al . 1991 ; schindler 1996 ) revealed that the x - ray emission in a3528 is bimodal , and actually consists of two components , called a3528n and a3528s , whose centres are separated by @xmath9  13  arcmin ( @xmath9 570h@xmath5 kpc ) .    it has been proposed that a3528 is an early merger .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the x - ray temperature gradient in the regions facing the two structures ( schindler 1996 , hereinafter s96 ) , and by the complex results emerging from the substructure analysis ( bardelli et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "22 cm radio observations carried out by reid , hunstead and pierre ( 1998 , hereinafter rhp98 ) show that five extended radio sources are associated with cluster galaxies .",
    "they proposed that the head - tailed source located near the centre of a3528n was triggered on its first orbit around the cluster centre .",
    "they therefore concluded that the pre - merging stage of the cluster is responsible for the nuclear activity of the central radio galaxies .",

    "we consider as reliable all detections with peak flux density s@xmath35 0.8 mjy / beam , which corresponds to @xmath36 confidence level in field # 2 .    in order to compensate for the sensitivity loss towards the field edge due to the primary beam attenuation",
    ", we corrected the flux densities using the analytical formula of the atca primary beam attenuation given by wieringa & kesteven ( 1992 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux density measurement @xmath37 is a function of the map noise , the source flux density and the residual calibration error .",
    "we have assumed that    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the map noise , @xmath40 is the residual calibration error , estimated to be of the order of 1% , and @xmath41 is the source flux density .",
    "we point out however that a detailed analysis on the internal accuracy of the flux density measures for the sources in the atesp survey ( prandoni et al .",
    "2000a ) , carried out with the atca at 1.4 ghz at resolution comparable with the data presented in this paper , showed that the uncertainties in the flux density measures obtained from gaussian fits for sources with low signal to noise ratio , i.e. snr @xmath42 , can be as high as 10@xmath4315 % .",

    "simultaneous 13 cm ( 2.38 ghz ) observations were carried out in each configuration , and the data reduction and image analysis were carried out as for the 22 cm dataset . the adopted flux density for the primary calibrator b1934@xmath21638 is s@xmath46 = 11.6 jy .",

    "we detected a total of 106 radio sources at 22 cm above the flux density limit of 0.8 mjy .",
    "we point out that the 22 cm mjy survey presented here and in paper iii of this series is the deepest wide area surveys available in a cluster of galaxies type environment ( see prandoni et al .",
    "2000b for a review of the mjy and sub - mjy surveys available at this frequency ) .",

    "for the double sources in the sample we give the position of the radio barycentre , and for the remaining extended sources we give the position of the radio peak .",
    "the 13 cm flux density measurements are available only for a fraction of sources in our list , i.e. all sources with a distance smaller than @xmath49 arcmin from the respective field centre . as clear from table 3",

    "we marked these flux densities with @xmath51 .",
    "most of the sources detected in the 22 cm survey are unresolved ; there are 18 extended radio sources , corresponding to @xmath52 % of the total . among these extended radio sources we identify three wide - angle tail ( wat ) sources , three head - tails ( ht ) and five doubles .",
    "the remaining extended sources have more complex morphologies , and require observations at other frequencies and resolutions for a clear morphological classification .",

    "for all sources in our sample we also compared our flux density measurements with those obtained from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) images ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and found that the ratio @xmath53 is in the range 0.85@xmath431 , depending on the source structure , consistent with the lower resolution and different u - v coverage of nvss . given the better agreement between our values and those obtained from nvss and our more homogeneous analysis of the radio data , we now prefer the flux densities reported in table 3 for all sources in the a3528 complex",

    "this work is part of a larger ongoing project , whose main purpose is to study the effects of cluster mergers on the statistical properties of radio galaxies , and on the formation of cluster - type radio sources , such as radio halos and relics , which are believed to be related to major merger events .",
    "the target of our study is the central region of the shapley concentration , the largest supercluster in the nearby universe , where spectroscopic and x - ray observations lend support to earlier suggestions that cluster mergers play a major role ( see for instance raychaudhury 1991 , zucca et al . 1993 , ettori et al .",
    "1997 , bardelli et al .",
    "1998 , bardelli et al .",
    "2000 ) .      _",
    "( a ) _ the radio properties of the three clusters in the chain differ markedly from one other .",
    "a3528 , considered to be a pre - merging cluster , is very active at radio wavelengths , with five extended and distorted radio galaxies located at the centres of its two subcondensations .",
    "conversely , we detected no radio sources from a3530 or from the region between the cores of a3530 and a3532 , where a merger shock is expected .",
    "_ ( b ) _ the radio source counts are consistent , within the uncertainties , with the background counts down to the mjy level , implying that the radio source density does not scale with the optical density , which is a factor of 2.5 higher in the a3528 complex compared to the local background .",
    "this result is similar to what we obtained for the merging cluster complex a3558 ( paper iii ) , and confirms our earlier conclusions that the radio source counts do not trace the underlying optical density .",
    "therefore , very high density regions would not be spotted on the basis of radio surveys .    _",
    "( c ) _ the radio luminosity function for early - type galaxies is consistent , within the errors , with the rlf derived by lo96 for a large sample of cluster ellipticals .",
    "this suggests that the dense and unrelaxed environment of the a3528 region has no influence on the probability of an elliptical galaxy to become a radio source .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with the rlf obtained for the a3558 merging complex , which is significantly lower than lo96 ( paper iii ) .",
    "we propose that the different shapes and normalisations of the rlf in these two complexes of merging clusters are due to the different stages of the merger itself .    on the basis of the gas temperature gradients within a3528 ,",
    "s96 first proposed that a3528 is an early merger , where a3528n and",
    "a3528s have not yet undergone a major core - to - core encounter .",
    "more recently bardelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reinforced this assessment from a bi- and tri - dimensional analysis of clusters and groups in this region , emphasising that the central parts of the individual galaxy clusters in the chain are not far from virialization , and further suggesting that the effects of the merger are not yet evident on the galaxy population and cluster dynamics .",
    "the good agreement between the rlf derived in this paper for the a3528 cluster region and that for early type galaxies in abell clusters could be interpreted in the light of bardelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , i.e. the early stage of the merger has not yet affected the radio properties of cluster galaxies , which behave remarkably similarly to ellipticals in other environments .",
    "the situation in the a3558 region is quite different , since the observational evidence suggests that the cluster complex has already undergone the first core - to - core encounter for two massive clusters , and further accretion of small groups is at an advanced stage ( bardelli et al .",
    "1998b ) . the excess of blue galaxies in the position where a shock front in the merging structure is expected , and the rlf lower than lo96 , could be interpreted as the effects of the advanced merger , which has already had time to affect the galaxy optical and radio emission properties .",
    "one implication of this interpretation is that a cluster merger ultimately anticorrelates with the probability of a galaxy developing a radio source , either by switching off previously existing radio galaxies or inhibiting the formation of radio - loud agns .",
