    "probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems have been studied for many decades and by many authors , aiming to understand the transition from deterministic to stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant and fundamental questions concerns the existence of an appropriate invariant probability density ( or ergodic measure ) , characterizing chaotic motion in phase space regions where solutions generically exhibit exponential divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "if it is possible to define such an invariant measure for almost all initial conditions ( i.e. except for a set of measure zero ) , then one has a firm basis for studying the system from a statistical mechanics point of view .",
    "now , if this invariant measure is a continuous and sufficiently smooth function of the phase - space coordinates , one can invoke the boltzmann - gibbs microcanonical ensemble and attempt to evaluate all relevant quantities of equilibrium statistical mechanics , like partition function , free energy , entropy , etc . of the system under study . on the other hand ,",
    "if the measure is absolutely continuous ( as e.g. in the case of the so - called axiom a dynamical systems ) , one might still be able to use the formalism of modern ergodic theory to study the statistical properties of the model @xcite .    since the existence of an invariant measure is not known a priori",
    ", one may still proceed in the context of the central limit theorem@xcite ( clt ) and consider the values of one ( or a linear combination ) of components of a chaotic solution at discrete times @xmath2 as realizations of @xmath3 independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables @xmath4 .",
    "if the motion under study is uniformly chaotic ( ergodic ) in some region of phase space , one typically finds that the pdfs of the _ sums _ of these variables converge rapidly to a gaussian distribution , whose mean and variance are those of the @xmath5 s . in such cases ( which we call `` strongly '' chaotic )",
    "at least one lyapunov exponent is positive and the respective subset of the constant energy manifold is uniformly covered by chaotic orbits , for all but a ( lebesgue ) measure zero set of initial conditions .    what happens",
    ", however , if the motion is not uniformly chaotic and the orbits `` stick '' for long times on the boundaries of islands surrounding stable periodic orbits , where lyapunov exponents become very small and may even vanish ?",
    "in such regimes , the motion is often termed `` weakly '' chaotic , as trajectories get trapped within complicated sets of cantori and diffuse slowly through multiply connected domains in a highly non - uniform way @xcite .",
    "many such examples occurring in physically realistic systems have been studied in the recent literature ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the existence of possible connections between such regimes of `` weak '' and `` strong '' chaos and",
    "subdiffusive motion in the presence of disorder by considering a hamiltonian particle chain in the presence of nonlinearity and disorder .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate first that pdfs of sums of position variables in this system _ do not _ rapidly converge to a gaussian distribution , but are well approximated for long times by the so - called @xmath1-gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ] where the @xmath1 entropic index satisfies @xmath7 , @xmath8 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath9 is a normalization constant . eventually , of course , chaotic orbits seep out from smaller regions to larger chaotic seas , where obstruction by islands and cantori is less dominant and the dynamics is more uniformly chaotic .",
    "this transition is signalled by the @xmath1 entropic index of the distribution ( [ q_gaussian ] ) decreasing towards @xmath10 , which represents the limit at which the pdf becomes a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , we shall speak of `` weak '' chaos when the value of the entropic index @xmath1 is greater than unity by at least one decimal point , e.g. @xmath11 or higher ( with @xmath12 ) and the corresponding pdfs are distinctly different from a gaussian pdf .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath1 is closer to 1 we speak of `` strong '' chaos , where the associated pdfs become practically indistinguishable from a gaussian pdf , see e.g. our fig .",

    "in this work , we investigate the statistical properties of chaotic diffusion in a disordered klein - gordon chain .",
    "it is described by an autonomous @xmath14 degree of freedom hamiltonian of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the positions and momenta respectively of the system in continuous time @xmath17 . as is well - known",
    ", the solutions ( or orbits ) can be periodic , quasi - periodic or chaotic depending on the initial conditions and the values of their parameters .",
    "what we wish to explore here is the statistics of their diffusive dynamics in regimes of weakly chaotic motion , where lyapunov exponents are positive but very small .",
    "such situations often arise when solutions move slowly through thin chaotic layers , wandering through a complicated network of higher order resonances , often sticking for very long times to the boundaries of islands constituting the so - called `` edge of chaos '' regime @xcite .",
    "many interesting questions can be asked in this context : how long do these weakly chaotic states last ?",
    "what type of pdfs characterize them and how can one connect them to the diffusion properties of the system ?",
    "does disorder in the choice of their parameter values play a role in these considerations ?    to answer such questions , we use the solutions of the equations of motion of our hamiltonian system to construct pdfs of suitably rescaled sums of @xmath18 values of a generic observable @xmath19 which depends linearly on the position coordinates of the solution .",

    "note that this is a generalization of the well - known gaussian pdf , since in the limit @xmath30 we have @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the @xmath1-gaussian distribution ( [ q_gaussian ] ) is normalized when @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the euler @xmath33 function .",
    "clearly , eq . ( [ beta-@xmath1-gaussian ] ) shows that the allowed values of @xmath1 are @xmath7 for this normalization .",
    "the index @xmath1 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ q_gaussian ] ) is connected with the tsallis entropy @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 counts the microstates of the system , each occurring with a probability @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the well - known boltzmann constant . just as the gaussian distribution represents an extremal of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath38 , so is the @xmath1-gaussian ( [ q_gaussian ] ) derived by optimizing the tsallis entropy of eq .",
    "( [ tsallis entropy ] ) under appropriate constraints .",
    "systems characterized by the tsallis entropy are said to lie at the `` edge of chaos '' and are significantly different than boltzmann - gibbs systems , in the sense that their entropy is nonadditive and generally nonextensive @xcite .",
    "in fact , a @xmath1-central limit theorem has been proved @xcite for @xmath1-gaussian distributions ( [ q_gaussian ] ) that is of the same form as the classical clt .",
    "let us now describe the numerical aspects of the calculation of the above pdfs .",
    "first of all , in every case under study , we specify an observable denoted by @xmath39 as one ( or a linear combination ) of the position variables of a chaotic solution .",
    "then , we divide the time interval of the evolution of the orbit into a predefined fixed number of @xmath40 equally spaced , consecutive time windows , which are long enough to contain a significant part of the orbit .",
    "next , we subdivide each of the @xmath40 time windows into a fixed number @xmath18 of equally spaced subintervals and calculate the sum @xmath41 of the values of the observable @xmath39 at the _",
    "right edges _ of these subintervals ( see eq . ( [ sums_clt ] ) ) . in this way",
    ", we treat the point at the beginning of every time window as a new initial condition and repeat this process @xmath40 times to obtain as many sums as required for reliable statistics .    as we shall see in the next sections , in regions of weak chaos these distributions are well - fitted by a @xmath1-gaussian for fairly long evolution intervals , whose @xmath1 value is distinctly greater than 1 .",
    "it may happen , of course , for longer times that the orbits begin to diffuse through domains of strong chaos , in which case @xmath1 tends to 1 and the well - known form of a gaussian pdf is recovered .",
    "the absence of diffusion in disordered media ( the so - called _ _ anderson localization__@xcite ) is a general phenomenon that applies to the transport of different types of classical or quantum waves , like electromagnetic , acoustic and spin waves .",
    "it is interesting to ask what happens if nonlinearity is introduced to the disordered system .",
    "understanding the effect of nonlinearity on the localization properties of wave packets in disordered systems has attracted the attention of many researchers to date @xcite .",
    "most of these studies consider the evolution of an initially localized wave packet and show that it spreads subdiffusively for moderate nonlinearities , while for strong enough nonlinearities a substantial part of it is self - trapped . in such works ,",
    "one typically analyzes normalized norm or energy distributions @xmath42 and measures the second moment @xmath43 where @xmath44 , which is an efficient measure of the wave packet s spreading .",
    "in particular , for single - site excitations the wave packet s spreading leads to an increase of the second moment according to @xmath45 , both in the diffusive as well as the self - trapping case@xcite .    currently , a greatly debatable problem is the long time behavior of wave packet spreading in disordered nonlinear lattices .",
    "recently it was conjectured@xcite that chaotically spreading wave packets will asymptotically approach kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) torus - like structures in phase - space , while numerical simulations typically do not show any sign of slowing down of the spreading behavior@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for particular disordered nonlinear models some numerical indications of a possible slowing down of spreading have been reported @xcite .",
    "thus , we decided to implement the ideas of tsallis statistics to shed new light on this problem .    for this purpose , we consider the quartic klein - gordon lattice described by the hamiltonian of @xmath14 degrees of freedom @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the generalized positions and momenta on site @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are chosen uniformly randomly from the interval @xmath51 $ ] to account for the disorder present at each site @xmath49 .",
    "this hamiltonian conserves the value of the total energy @xmath52 of the system , which , for fixed disorder strength @xmath53 , serves as a control parameter of the nonlinearity . in our study",
    ", we follow the evolution of single site excitations by solving the equations of motion @xmath54 and monitor normalized energy density distributions .    in the next section",
    ", we first present the results of our numerical experiments describing the chaotic dynamics of wave packets in a kg chain of @xmath13 particles for the low energy ( subdiffusive ) as well the high energy ( self - trapping ) case .",
    "we then carry out an analysis of the _ statistics _ of the motion in the sense of the clt and find , in both cases , convincing evidence of initially weak and eventually strong chaos , for times as long as @xmath0 !",
    "indeed , our results show _ no sign _ of quasi - periodic kam behavior and serve to further strengthen the conjecture that waves spread subdiffusively and chaotically for arbitrarily long times in nonlinear disordered media .",
    "we use two representative examples of energies , @xmath55 ( subdiffusive spreading ) and @xmath56 ( self - trapping ) as reported in the work of skokos et al.@xcite and integrate numerically the kg chain using a fourth order yoshida s symplectic integrator @xcite , which is very efficient for long integrations ( e.g. up to @xmath57 time units ) of lattices having typically @xmath13 sites , to keep the required computational time at feasible levels , preserving at the same time the energy of the system to satisfactory accuracy . in particular , an integration time step @xmath58 typically keeps the relative energy error at about @xmath59 . in both cases , we consider one disorder realization , i.e. one random sequence of @xmath60 in hamiltonian ( [ rqkg ] ) and a single site initial excitation of the form @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . for the computation of the lyapunov exponents ,",
    "we apply the _ tangent map method_@xcite which is suitable for the evolution of deviation vectors in the tangent space of the orbit under study .",
    "having thus access to the deviation vectors , we compute the lyapunov exponents in descending order ( i.e. @xmath67 ) following the so - called _ standard method_@xcite .      in this section",

    "however , pdfs of sums of orbit components _ do not _ rapidly converge to a gaussian , but are well approximated , for long times , by the @xmath1-gaussian ( [ q_gaussian ] ) distribution characterized by @xmath71 ( @xmath10 corresponding to a gaussian pdf ) .",

    "[ q_time_evolution_n1000_e0.4_different_etas ] , we see that in the subdiffusive case ( @xmath55 ) , the central 5 to 29 particles initially perform a weakly chaotic motion depicted by the tendency of the corresponding @xmath86-@xmath87 entropic indices to attain values considerably higher than 1 ( even though they later decay towards 1 ) . on the other hand ,",

    "recently@xcite it was found that for this case the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath94 decreases as @xmath95 .",

    "there was a tendency of the @xmath1 values to fall towards 1 but since calculations for @xmath89 are very time consuming we decided to postpone a more detailed study for a future publication .",
    "a comment on the numerical evaluation of @xmath92 is useful here . in our computation",
    "we use three initially linearly independent deviation vectors , namely @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which correspond to initial perturbations at the first three lattice sites .",
    "these oscillators remain practically unexcited for the duration of the numerical simulation , as long as the lattice size and the final integration time are chosen so that the wave packet does not reach the lattice boundaries . nevertheless , due to the coupling between the oscillators , these perturbations eventually propagate throughout the whole lattice .",
    "the choice of the initial deviation vectors influences the initial phase of the lyapunov exponents but not their asymptotic behavior , as any set of deviation vectors eventually leads to the same estimation . during this initial phase",
    "the estimated lyapunov exponents behave as in the case of regular orbits , exhibiting a @xmath105 decrease .",

    "in this paper we have studied the dynamics and statistics of diffusive motion in a 1-dimensional klein - gordon chain in the presence of disorder .",
    "our statistical approach is based on the computation of sums of position coordinates , in the spirit of the central limit theorem , approximating their pdfs by @xmath1-gaussians , whose index @xmath106 is connected with weak chaos , while @xmath10 corresponds to strong chaos .",
    "in particular , we considered a disordered kg chain of @xmath13 particles focusing on a low energy ( subdiffusive ) and on a higher energy ( self - trapping ) case and verified that subdiffusive spreading always occurs following specific power - laws with exponents smaller than 1 as pointed out in the literature .",
    "subsequently , integrating the equations of motion for times as long as @xmath0 and computing the corresponding pdfs , we found evidence that the dynamics does _ not _ relax onto a quasi - periodic kam torus , as it has been conjectured , but continues to spread chaotically along the chain for arbitrarily long times .",
    "one might argue that , since the strength of the nonlinearity diminishes during spreading , it is somewhat counter - intuitive that the motion should become more chaotic with @xmath107 as time grows .",
    "we conjecture however , that this may be due to the fact that , as diffusion progresses and more particles become activated , the effective _ dimensionality _ of the phase space becomes higher and hence the orbits have to wander over wider chaotic domains , while stickiness on the boundaries of multidimensional islands becomes less likely to happen .",
    "recently , we carried out a preliminary study of systems of @xmath14 coupled 2-dimensional symplectic maps that may be regarded as simple examples of hamiltonian particle chains .",
    "indeed , it would be highly desirable to find such examples , as they would permit a much more detailed investigation of diffusive phenomena , owing to their great computational advantage over systems of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , even though we do find examples of such systems that display subdiffusive motion with pdfs of the @xmath1-gaussian type , there are important differences that , at present , preclude their use as alternative models for the type of diffusive dynamics we have studied in this paper .",
