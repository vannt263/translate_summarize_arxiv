    "the problem of interaction of few - photon pulses with two - level systems ( tlss ) attracts an increasing interest .",

    "the tlss are the simplest implementations of the stationary quantum bits ( qubits ) . in practice ,",
    "various multilevel systems are used : trapped ions @xcite or neutral atoms @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions @xcite , semiconductor quantum dots @xcite _ etc_. nevertheless , in many cases those multilevel systems can be modeled as tlss . this simplification is quite reasonable if the frequency of the incident radiation is close to the transition frequency between the corresponding pair of levels .",
    "recent experiments show that photons can act as transmitters of quantum states between distant stationary qubits @xcite",
    ". moreover , stationary qubits are able to controllably generate correlations between photons .",
    "the qubits , connected by optical or microwave waveguides , form scalable chip - based circuits @xcite .",
    "these circuits are considered now as a potential hardware basis for the qip systems .",
    "properties of photons propagating in waveguide - qubit systems have attracted increasing interest .    theoretical description of propagation of few - photon pulses in waveguides coupled to a tls can be found in numerous publications @xcite .",
    "for example , a  collision \" of two wavepackets at a tls was studied @xcite . a striking difference in the interaction of the",
    "fock state and coherent state wavepackets of the same photon number was illustrated .",
    "it was shown , that photon - tls coupling induces correlation between photons that can be interpreted as their  interaction \" .",
    "this controllable photon - photon interaction may be used for generation of spatiotemporal entanglement and four - wave mixing effects @xcite .",
    "evolution of the photon - tls was studied in the heisenberg picture in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the authors of @xcite preferred the schrdinger picture .",
    "the theoretical analysis is simplified if the incoming and outgoing radiation fields are away from the tls and , accordingly , are outside of the interaction range . in those regions",
    "the evolution of fields is as if there is no interaction with the tls . in this situation",
    "the initial and the final states of the radiation are connected by the @xmath1 matrix whose elements can be extracted from the eigenstates of the full interacting hamiltonian . provided that the @xmath1 matrix is known , the outgoing field can be expressed via the entering field .",
    "a rigorous program to construct the complete scattering matrix which is applicable for two or more photons was developed in @xcite . using that technique the physical quantities like transmission or reflection",
    "coefficients can be obtained analytically .",

    "the authors of @xcite inferred that the input - output approach was more elementary than the techniques developed earlier in @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg picture is suitable for using the formalism of a phase - space distribution function @xcite which provides a comprehensive description of the system . within this approach",
