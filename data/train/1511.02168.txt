    "over the past decade mathematical models have continued to provide insights into complex systems .",
    "much of this work was grounded in the exploration of simple models from many areas , including ecology and epidemiology @xcite .",
    "as the theoretical tools for the analysis of networks have been refined , the focus of current work has shifted to extend the range of systems that can be treated as networks . while earlier network models focused on structural properties of static systems @xcite , recent advances focus on dynamic and properties of time varying networks@xcite .",
    "similarly the information encoded in networks has evolved from simple , often binary , variables to structures in which nodes and links can assume complex states in what are often described as multi - layer or multiplex networks @xcite .",
    "theoretical progress in the analysis of complex networks both enables and requires a progression towards more complex models .",
    "for example one extension to simple epidemic models are coinfection models , which describe the simultaneous and interdependent spreading of two diseases @xcite .",
    "while these models have received some attention , very similar challenges encountered in ecology remain largely unexplored .    in ecology",
    "it is widely recognized that our environment is not evenly distributed .",
    "typical landscapes are broken into distinct habitat patches .",
    "examples include patches of forest remaining in an agricultural landscape , islands , in an archipelago , systems of lakes , or parks in a city , .",
    "a network representation of the environment can be constructed by using nodes to represent the discrete patches of habitat with links between pairs of patches between which a species can spread .",
    "another type of network that is considered in ecology are food webs , the networks of who eats who . in a food web",
    "the nodes represent populations of different species and directed links represent trophic ( i.e. predator - prey ) interactions .    an emerging topic in the ecological literature",
    "are so - called meta - foodwebs @xcite , which combine trophic and geographical complexity .",
    "meta - foodwebs describe the interactions between several different food webs in space and one particular class of meta - foodwebs is described by the colonization - extinction model proposed by pillai @xcite .",
    "meta - foodwebs can be described as networks of networks or multilayer networks @xcite . to connect the ecological system to physical terminology",
    "one can regard the system from two different perspectives .",
    "the first of these focusses on the food web : we can say that meta - foodwebs are collections of food - webs that exist in different spatial patches and interact through the dispersal of individuals between patches . seen from this perspective , the food webs are the layers of the network , predator - prey interactions are within - layer interactions , whereas dispersal of individuals between patches constitutes between layer interactions",
    ".    we can describe the same class of systems in a different way by saying that meta - foodwebs are geographical networks of species dispersal that interact through feeding interactions .",
    "now the network layers are formed by the geographical network , dispersal between patches is a within - layer interaction , whereas the feeding interactions constitute between layer interactions .",
    "the former perspective is useful when the food web is more complex than the geographical network , whereas the latter is useful when the geographical network is more complex than the food web . in ecology plenty of examples for both cases",
    "are encountered , and thus it may be useful to apply the elegant notation proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , in the present paper we focus on the case where the food web is very simple ( a linear chain ) , whereas the geographical network is both larger and complex in structure , we therefore employ the later perspective .",
    "we thus regard the spatial dispersal networks as network layers , which interact through feeding interactions .",
    "pillai s meta - foodweb model has been studied in the ecological literature using agent - based simulations .",
    "the central ecological question driving this work is how landscape structure impacts food web structure@xcite .",
    "it was shown that higher connectivity in the geographical networks generally benefits the persistence of species on the landscape level .",
    "however , in very strongly connected systems , specialist species tend to outcompete generalist species , such that most complex food webs are found at intermediate geographical connectivity@xcite .    a theoretical approach for the computation of persistence thresholds in colonization - extinction models has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "this work used the so called _ homogeneous approximation _ in which all patches are considered to have the same number of links ( degree ) .",
    "however , previous work on epidemics has demonstrated , that spreading processes can be understood well by utilising the power of generating functions@xcite .",
    "in particular , such approaches can be used to reveal the degree distribution ( the probability distribution of links per node ) of nodes in a particular state .    by using generating functions we can find the degree distribution of the network of geographical patches experienced by each species .",
    "these degree distributions differ from the degree distribution of the underlying geographical network , because some patches may be inhospitable to a given species due to its interactions with other species .",
    "for instance the absence of suitable prey can make a patch inhospitable to a given predator and thus removes the node from the network accessible to a predator . by revealing the degree distributions experienced by the different species , generating functions hold the promise of enabling a deeper understanding of the impact of landscape connectivity on ecological dynamics .",
    "here we present a generating function approach to analyse how the degree distribution of the patch network affects food chains , in which each species has at most one predator and one prey .",
    "we find that properties such as the shape and mean of the patch degree distribution affects the occupation probability of all species in the food chain , and the viability of survival for the species at the top of the food chain . beyond the ecological insights ,",
    "this paper highlights meta - foodchains and meta - foodwebs as promising example systems for the future refinement of tools of statistical physics .",
    "we study a version of the model proposed by pillai et al . in @xcite .",
    "a set of species numbered @xmath0 to @xmath1 inhabits an environment comprising a set of discrete patches . this environment is represented by a network , where nodes represent the patches and links represent the possible routes of dispersal between patches .",
    "the model accounts for the presence , or absence , of each species in the food chain at each patch .",
    "the populations of different species interact with each other via trophic ( feeding ) relationships .",
    "species @xmath0 is a so - called primary producer , a species that can persist on abiotic resources . in the model this species can colonize any patch independently of the presence of other species .",
    "all other species , @xmath2 , are specialist consumers who each prey upon a single species , @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , a species @xmath4 can only inhabit a patch that species @xmath3 also inhabits .    the system varies dynamically due to random extinctions of species at individual patches and colonisations of patches by new species .",
    "when established at a patch , species @xmath4 is subject to random extinction at rate @xmath5 .",
    "the interaction between species means that when species @xmath4 goes extinct on a patch , all species @xmath6 must also go extinct at that patch , because they now lack an essential resource farther down the chain .",
    "this indirect extinction means that a species @xmath4 will go extinct on a particular patch at an effective rate equal to the sum of its direct extinction rate , @xmath5 , and the extinction rates of all species below it in the food chain .",
    "when established at a patch species @xmath4 may also colonise neighbouring patches at a rate , @xmath7 , however due to the trophic interactions a species @xmath4 can only colonise a patch at which its prey , species @xmath3 , is already established .    while indirect extinction is a process between nodes of a food chain at a single patch , colonisation is a process between different food webs . despite this difference both",
    "imply that for the dynamics of a given species @xmath4 only the subnetwork of patches where species @xmath3 is established is relevant .",
    "we call this network the effective network for species @xmath4 .    over time the effective network for any species @xmath2 changes due to colonization and extinction events of species @xmath3 .",
    "these events affect @xmath4 s effective network by changing its size , the number of nodes ; its connectivity , the number of links per node ; and its degree distribution , the probability distribution of the number of links per node . here",
    "we present a method for finding the effective network of all species @xmath2 and hence the pattern of dispersal for all species in the food chain .",
    "to study the dispersal of species we describe the system on the level of the configuration model , where a given network is characterised by its degree distribution .    from the degree distribution of the patch network we consider the dispersal of species @xmath0 to find the degree distribution of the effective network for species @xmath8 via two steps ( fig .",
    "[ dischange ] ) :    1 .   finding the expected degree distribution of patches in",
    "which species @xmath0 is established .",
    "2 .   removing links from this distribution which lead to patches in which species @xmath0 is not established , and which are hence inaccessible to species @xmath8 .",
    "similarly we use the same two steps to consider the dispersal of species @xmath8 over the degree distribution of its effective network to find the effective network of species @xmath9 . by repeating this process through successive levels",
    "we find the degree distribution of all effective networks , and thus the properties of dispersal for all species @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "example of the two step process for finding the degree distribution of the effective network of species @xmath8 .",
    "we start with the patch network and its degree distribution , @xmath10 , ( a ) .",
    "the first step identifies the nodes colonised by the species , @xmath11 , ( b ) .",
    "the second step removes links from colonised nodes to uncolonised nodes from the distribution giving the effective network , @xmath12 , ( c ) .",
    "this is the network upon which species @xmath8 disperses . ]    to find the expected degree distribution of the patches inhabited by species @xmath0 we find the degree - dependent probability that species @xmath0 inhabits a patch with degree @xmath13 .",
    "the probability that a patch has degree @xmath13 is @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath11 to be the probability that a patch has both degree @xmath13 and is inhabited by species @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ dischange ] ) .    in contrasts to @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a dynamical variable which changes in time due to colonization and extinction events . for a sufficieantly large system",
    "these dynamics can be captured by the differential equation @xmath14 where the first term captures random extinctions and the second term captures the effect of colonisations . in the colonisation term @xmath15 is the probability that a link with an empty patch at one end has a colonised patch at the other . if we assume no correlation between the state of neighbouring patches then @xmath16 .",
    "this overestimates the potential for colonisation and it is shown in @xcite that for a significant parameter region a better approximation can be obtained by correcting for backtracking , which yields @xmath17 .",
    "systems of the form of eq .",
    "( [ dchi ] ) typically either approach a steady state where @xmath18 for all @xmath13 , such that the species goes extinct , or a nontrivial steady state in which the population survives . to compute this nontrivial steady state",
    "we must solve the system of differential equations for all patch degrees .",
    "here we follow the approach of @xcite and use the method of generating functions to transform the system of equations into a single partial differential equation , which can then be solved for the desired steady state .",
    "we encode the degree distribution of the patches by the probability generating function , @xmath19 and the dynamically chaining probability generating function for the colonised patches @xmath20 .",

    "from the power series definition of @xmath24 we can solve the integral explicitly for the general case to find the occupied fraction of nodes of each degree , the values of @xmath11 .",
    "this integration gives @xmath37 and by comparison of the coefficients of the polynomial we find the occupation probability of a node of degree @xmath13 is @xmath38 .",

    "we have presented a mathematical approach to the degree distribution of the network accessible to species at various levels of a food chain . for the finite patch networks we found the network accessible",
    "both shrinks and becomes harder to spread over for species at successive levels .",
    "hence the maximum effective extinction rate with which a species can survive decreases as we consider species higher in the food chain .    the analytical solutions also indicate a maximum abundance for a species , @xmath82 , which is dependent on the effective extinction rate , @xmath75 , and the mean degree of the network it disperses over,@xmath83 .",

    "importantly , we found that while very heterogeneous , scale - free , distributions come very close to the theoretical optimum at high @xmath75 , less heterogeneous distributions lead to higher abundances when @xmath75 is lower .",
    "one implication of the results is that species close to the bottom of the food chain can sometimes profit from homogeneous degree distributions .",
    "however , species higher up in the same food chain may nevertheless be more abundant if the underlying topology is more heterogeneous .",
    "that means a finite scale - free distribution is likely to allow more species to survive than a poisson distribution even when the latter allows a greater abundance of species low in the food chain .    in land use planning one",
    "is often forced to decide which patches of forest to conserve , or where to place green spaces in a city .",
    "hence the planner has some control over the degree distribution of the patch networks these created by these processes .",
    "if seeking to maximise the abundance of a particular species our results show that a good estimation of @xmath75 is required to inform any decisions .",
    "in addition maximising the abundance of the lowest species in the food chain may not maximise the number of species that survive .",
    "this is of particular note in the real world where small populations may be less resilient to external shocks .",
    "the approach we use provides the tools required to analyse the behaviour of food chains on patch networks with varying degree distributions .",
    "investigations into degree distributions other than those presented here will provide more information about the implications of landscape distributions on the resident species .    in this paper",
    "we have focused solely on food chains , an important class of food webs that is at the focus of many ecological studies . however",
    ", many more complex food webs topologies also play a significant role in ecology @xcite .",
    "in contrast to chains these webs also contain inter - species competition for prey , and predation on multiple prey species .",
    "this paper has established two operations in the algebra of pillai - style colonization extinction models .",
    "the pruning of links to patches where an essential resource is missing and the subsequent renormalization of the degree distribution . to accommodate additional interaction that occur in food webs an additional operation is necessary , the pruning of patches where a superior competitor is established .",
    "this operation is similar to the pruning of patches studied here and , although the notation does get more cumbersome , no fundamental obstacles should arise in this step .",
    "thus the approach proposed here can be adapted to deal with more complex webs .",
    "the treatment presented here was relatively easy because we were able to compute the degree distributions iteratively , from the bottom layer up .",
    "the same is also true for some more complex food web topologies as long as their is a clear hierarchy in the strength of competitors .",
    "some ecological interactions break these hierarchies .",
    "a simple example is neutral competition where two competitors can defend a patch in which they are established against the other species",
    ". a mathematically more interesting scenario ( which is fortunately rare in ecology ) is the case where predators can drive their own prey to extinction . in both cases interdependencies",
    "arise such that systems of generating functions have to be solved simultaneously .",
    "dealing with these non - iterative cases is mathematically more difficult , but could also lead to much richer dynamics .",
