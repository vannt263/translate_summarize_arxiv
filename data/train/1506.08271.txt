    "in this paper , a homology theory is proposed that contains aspects of both group and quandle homology theories , for algebraic structures that have both operations and certain compatibility conditions between them .",
    "the notion of a quandle @xcite was introduced in knot theory as a generalization of the fundamental group .",
    "briefly , a quandle is a set with a binary operation that is idempotent , self - distributive , and the corresponding right action is bijective .",
    "the axioms correspond to the reidemeister moves , and quandles have been used extensively to construct knot invariants .",
    "they have been considered in various other contexts , for example as symmetries of geometric objects @xcite , and with different names , such as distributive groupoids  @xcite and automorphic sets  @xcite .",
    "a typical example is a group conjugation @xmath1 which is an expression of the wirtinger relation for the fundamental group of the knot complement . the same structure but without idempotency",
    "is called a rack , and is used in the study of framed links  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite a chain complex was introduced for racks .",
    "the resulting homology theory was modified in  @xcite by defining a quotient complex that reflected the quandle idempotence axiom .",
    "the motivation for this homology was to construct the quandle cocycle invariants for links and surface - links . since then a variety of applications have been found .",
    "the quandle cocycle invariants were generalized to handlebody - links in @xcite .",
    "when a set has multiple quandle operations that are parametrized by a group , the structure is called a @xmath2-family of quandles ; this notion and its associated homology theory was introduced in @xcite and it too was motivated from handlebody - knots . this homology theory is called _ iijo_. in particular , cocycle invariants were introduced that distinguished mirror images of some of handlebody - knots .",
    "these @xmath2-families were further generalized to an algebraic system called a multiple conjugation quandle ( mcq ) in @xcite for colorings of handlebody - knots .",
    "an mcq has a quandle operation and partial group operations , with compatibility conditions among the operations .",
    "the current paper proposes to unify the group and quandle homology theories for mcqs .",
    "the definition of an mcq is recalled in section  [ sec : mcq ] as a generalization of a @xmath2-family of quandles .",
    "a homology theory is defined ( in section  [ sec : homology ] ) that simultaneously encompasses the group and quandle homologies of the interrelated structures . as in the case of @xcite ,",
    "some subcomplexes are defined in order to compensate for the topological motivation of the theory .",
    "the first homology group is characterized , and the notion of extensions by @xmath0-cocycles is provided in section  [ sec : alg ] .",
    "the homology theory for mcq is well suited for handlebody - links such that each toroidal component has its core circle oriented , as defined in section  [ sec : coloring ] . when considering colorings for unoriented handlebody - links , we also need to take into consideration issues about the inverse elements in the group ( section  [ sec : unori ] ) .",
    "prismatic sets ( products of simplices ) are decomposed into sub - simplices , that are higher dimensional analogues of graph moves ; section  [ sec : decomp ] defines a subcomplex that compensates for these subdivisions . in section  [ sec : g ] and section  [ sec : iijo ] , we relate this homology theory with group and quandle homology theories .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : attempt ] , we discuss approaches to finding new @xmath0-cocycles of our homology theory .",
    "first , recall a _ quandle _",

    "an mcq is a type of quandles that can be decomposed as a union of groups , and the quandle operation in each component is given by conjugation .",
    "moreover , there are compatibilities , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , between the group and quandle operations .",
    "note that the quandle axiom @xmath6 follows immediately since the operation in any component is given by conjugation .",
    "the second quandle axiom also follows , since for the map @xmath23 defined by @xmath8 , the inverse map is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the second axiom of mcq implies that the map @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 is a group homomorphism , where @xmath27 is the set of quandle automorphisms of @xmath3 and is the group with the multiplication defined by @xmath28 .",
    "the last axiom ( 4 ) may be replaced with    * for any @xmath15 and @xmath29 , there is a unique element @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and that @xmath32 is a group isomorphism .",
    "the axiom ( 4 ) immediately follows from @xmath33 .",
    "conversely , @xmath33 follows from @xmath34 : the condition ( 4 ) contains the condition that for any @xmath35 and @xmath36 , there exists a unique @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .",
