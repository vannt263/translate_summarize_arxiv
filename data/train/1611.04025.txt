    "the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions provides an excellent means to study the existence of new form of matter at extreme conditions of energy density and temperature@xcite.the bulk properties of the system created in such collisions can be studied via the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution of the produced charged particles which reflect the conditions during the kinetic freeze out together with the integrated effects of the collective expansion from very initial stages.the bulk properties of the medium created in such collisions is usually studied through the statistical approach.one of the well known approaches to the particle production is governed by hydrodynamics inspired models based on boltzman - gibbs ( bg ) statistics.the models assumes the occurrence of a local thermal equilibrium and hence has a common fixed temperature @xmath1 associated with the hadronizing system.the transverse momentum(@xmath0 ) distributions were explained by the boltzman - gibbs blast wave ( bgbw ) hydrodynamical model fits to the data to obtain a set of bulk parameters at freeze out such as temperature,@xmath1 and the radial flow velocity ( @xmath2 ) @xcite.the successful application of such hydrodynamical models in limited @xmath0 range also provided evidence of collective motion in the continuously expanding system created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of large elliptic anisotropy in momentum in non - central collisions points towards a nearly thermalized and strongly interacting system.the equilibrium description based on ideal hydrodynamical models where bg statistics can be applied are generally limited to low @xmath0.it is not always a good idea to select or constrain the @xmath0 regime so that the model fitting procedure works .",
    "however , hadronizing systems experience hard qcd scattering processes during initial stages , intrinsic initial state fluctuations due to formation of initial color glass condensate ( cgc ) formation , fluctuations in temperature , initial energy density _ etc . _ which can be interpreted as dynamical non - equilibrium effects.these non - equilibrium processes",
    "may not be washed away by multi - particle interactions in the initial qgp ( quark gluon plasma ) state or in the later hadronic phase and can manifest more dominantly in spectral shape at intermediate or high @xmath0@xcite .",
    "recent studies on the generation of azimuthal anisotropy and @xmath3 mass splitting using multi - phase transport models suggest the dominant role of anisotropic parton escape mechanism to describe the measured azimuthal anisotropy in small system and heavy ion collisions.the escape mechanism shows that the most of the @xmath3 is developed during the parton cascade stage and the origin of mass splitting is attributed to hadron re - scatterings @xcite.this clearly shows that evolution of the system based on hydrodynamical scenario is not imperative.in the past , tsallis non - extensive statistics have been used extensively to understand the particle production and to describe the evolution of @xmath0 spectra in @xmath4 and heavy ion collisions at various energies@xcite.the @xmath5 parameter in the tsallis statistics characterize the deviation from the assumed conditions of local thermal equilibrium in systems created in such collisions . in previous studies , tsallis distribution have been incorporated into the blast wave model ( tbw ) and have been used successfully to describe the spectra at rhic energies@xcite.the distribution was also applied to describe the data in @xmath4 collisions at lhc energies to observe the onset of radial flow in smaller systems@xcite.however , the observation of finite radial flow in smaller systems hinting towards collectivity in such systems is still under investigation and it is highly debatable whether hydrodynamics can be applied in smaller systems .",
    "recently , the weibull model was used to describe successfully the particle production in @xmath4(@xmath6 ) and @xmath7 collisions for a broad range of energies@xcite.a weibull - glauber approach was also developed to understand the charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy distribution in heavy ion collisions@xcite.this is natural to assume as the individual nucleon - nucleon collisions inside the nucleus - nucleus collision has an inherent pqcd parton cascade evolution and fragmentation.the weibull distribution is usually used to describe natural processes where fragmentation and sequential branching is one of the major ingredients of the dynamical evolution@xcite .",
    "the aim of the letter is to propose a generalized distribution within the framework of non - equilibrium q - statistics which would describe the @xmath0 distribution successfully for both small systems ( @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) and the system created in heavy ion collisions for all ranges of measured @xmath0 .",
    "the successful description of weibull model describing particle production can be utilized to incorporate the tsallis q - statistics to weibull distribution to obtain a more generalized q - weibull distribution.the q - weibull distribution has been previously applied to many complex system in different areas of interest@xcite in this letter , we use q - weibull distribution to describe the @xmath0 distribution of charged hadrons emitted in @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems for broad range of energies.the distribution provides a generalized statistical framework where both small and large systems can be compared.apart from describing the spectral evolution , the physical interpretation of the model parameters will provide quantitative insight into the dynamical processes in such collisions and help in predicting the spectra for future studies .",
    "the most common way to incorporate the q - statistic to the weibull model is to replace the exponential factors by their equivalent q - exponential@xcite .",
    "the two parameter weibull distribution is given by the following expression    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the free parameters .",
    "the q - weibull distribution is given by @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14    the value of the non - extensive @xmath5 parameter is related to the deviation of the system from thermal equilibrium.in general , @xmath15 value is attributed to the presence of intrinsic fluctuations in the system and depends upon the observable being measured .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate whether one can describe the @xmath0 distribution of charged hadrons in @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( heavy ion ) collisions for a broad range of available energies using the q - weibull approach.this would allow the q - weibull function the most generalized parametrization to explain the @xmath0 distribution .    in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "tsallis distribution was successful in explaining the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath4 collisions for the entire @xmath0 range for most of the beam energies studied .",
    "one expects that the q - weibull function should describe the @xmath0 spectrum for charged particles in @xmath4 collisions as it incorporates both the weibull model of particle production and the q - statistics which has been very successful so far.the @xmath0 distribution of charged hadrons were fitted with q - weibull function in @xmath6 and @xmath4 collisions as measured by ua1 experiment @xcite and alice experiment at various energies@xcite , respectively.this is depicted in figure  [ f1].the values of the extracted parameters are shown in table1 and table2.it will be interesting to see whether one can extend the functional description to @xmath8 and heavy ion collisions where the system created has higher degree of complexity and richer features of particle production mechanism .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the description for @xmath16 collisions at 5.02 tev @xcite .",
    "the distribution for @xmath17 collisions at 2.76 tev @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite collisions at 200 gev for various centrality classes are shown in figure  [ f3 ] and figure  [ f4 ] respectively .",
    "as can be observed from the figures , the q - weibull fits provide an excellent description of the data for different systems and for broad range of energies in the measured @xmath0 range.as q - weibull appears to be the most generalized q - distribution to explain the features of @xmath0 distribution , it seems important to study the evolution of its parameters with beam energy , type of colliding systems and centrality classes considered.this would allow to attribute some dynamics associated with the collisions processes to the parameters and thus one can have better understanding of the complex phenomena and have some quantitative estimates for future studies .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the centrality dependence of the @xmath5 parameter extracted in @xmath17 collisions at 2.76 tev .",
    "the non - extensive parameter @xmath5 which quantifies the deviation from local equilibrium goes up as we move from peripheral to central collisions if we consider the entire @xmath0 regime for the fit.the behavior is on expected lines as the initial pqcd hard scattering processes followed by fragmentation and hadronization dominates the particle production mechanism in hadronic interactions and supports the non - equilibrium scenario in such collisions.the processes becomes more harder in more central collisions and the relative contributions from initial state fluctuations is also more in central collisions.hence , we observe an increasing trend of deviation from equilibrium with centrality .",
    "however , the @xmath5 values shows a slight decreasing trend or remains more or less constant around 1.0 if we constrain the @xmath0 limit of the fit to lower values ( up to 2 @xmath19).this is in agreement with the hydrodynamical expectation where one sees a local equilibrium to be attained as the low @xmath0 hadrons emanate from a nearly thermally equilibrated system.the @xmath5 parameter in @xmath4 collisions is consistently greater than 1.0 and one can see larger @xmath5 values at highest energies as shown in table 1.this supports a similar mechanism of particle production via initial hard - scatterings across all energies concerned with an increase of relative contributions of hard or semi hard processes with energy .",
    "figure  [ f6 ] shows the behavior of @xmath11 parameter for different centrality in @xmath17 and @xmath18 collisions.the @xmath11 value shows an increase from peripheral to central collisions for both integrated @xmath0 regime and the low @xmath0 regime.this shows that the @xmath11 parameter is related to the mean @xmath0 of the distribution.this can also be related to a common radial velocity ( as per transverse expansion scenario in hydrodynamic evolution ) in the low @xmath0 regime which goes up with centrality .",
    "the @xmath11 parameter in @xmath4 collisions is more or less constant across the beam energies considered if one restricts the fit to a common value ( 16 gev / c in this case ) which is expected .",
    "the @xmath12 parameter shows a decrease as we move from central to peripheral collisions in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 collisions as shown in figure  [ f7 ] .",
    "however , the trend is reversed in the low @xmath0 regime .",
    "this indicates that @xmath12 parameter is related to the dynamics of particle production and its value increases with onset of hard qcd scatterings , initial fluctuations and other processes leading to non - equilibrium conditions .    to understand the physical implications of the parameters better ,",
    "one requires a systematic study of q - weibull model fits from isr to lhc energies in case of hadronic collisions and from sps to lhc energies for heavy ion collisions.the fits to identified particle spectra will allow deeper understanding of the parameters and characterize the system evolution based the species ( baryon /meson ) and mass of the hadrons.the successful description of the spectra and the detailed interpretation of the model parameters will certainly be useful in providing qualitative estimates for future studies .",
