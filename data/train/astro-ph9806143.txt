    "the physical nature of the ionized gas observed in high redshift qso absorption systems has not been clearly determined so far .",
    "one possible mechanism capable of ionizing this gas is ultraviolet ( uv ) photoionization by the background field of distant active galactic nuclei and of local sources associated with the absorption systems . in this model ,",
    "two gas phases with different ionization parameters @xmath22 ( ratio of hydrogen ionizing photon density to total hydrogen density @xmath13 ) are commonly invoked in order to explain the presence of low and high ionization species , e.g. , mgii , civ , and ovi ( bergeron et al .",
    "@xcite ; lu & savage @xcite ) . as @xmath22 is defined by @xmath13 for a given ionizing field",
    ", one can also estimate the spatial extent of the ionized clouds along the line of sight ( los ) if the total hydrogen column density @xmath3(h ) is known .",
    "in general , the reliability of these models strongly depends on a good knowledge of the metal abundances involved . on the other hand , double loss toward background qsos",
    "offer a unique possibility to resolve such clouds geometrically and determine _ transverse _ sizes .",
    "for instance , smette et al .",
    "( @xcite ) report lower limits of @xmath23 to 2.2  h@xmath8 kpc for the diameters of two metal systems at @xmath24 toward um 673 ab , from the analysis of the line strengths in both qso spectra . a somewhat different result , although with large uncertainties , is achieved through statistical simulations by smette et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , who infer @xmath25  h@xmath8 kpc for civ clouds in the loss to he 11041805 ab . at higher resolution , rauch ( @xcite ) has recently shown that density gradients on sub - kpc scales in gas associated with metal systems are not uncommon .",
    "these results suggest that civ absorbers are composed of a large number of small cloudlets .",
    "he 11041805 ab ( @xmath0 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , angular separation @xmath6 ) was discovered in the course of the hamburg / eso survey ( wisotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and has been already studied at medium resolution by smette et al .",
    "( paper i ) .",
    "there is wide evidence for this qso to be gravitationally lensed ( paper i ; wisotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ; courbin , lidman , & magain  @xcite ) , so the proper separation between loss will depend on the ( hitherto not well established ) redshift of the lensing agent .",
    "two papers aimed at detecting the lensing galaxy of he 11041805 with somewhat different results have recently appeared . using ir direct imaging observations , courbin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimate the lensing galaxy to be at @xmath28 , while remy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find that their _",

    "( _ hst _ ) and ground - based direct imaging observations are consistent with @xmath29 .",
    "neither of these results influences our photoionization models .",
    "nevertheless , the small velocity differences and the similar line profiles between absorption lines in a and b at @xmath1 ( see   [ sec_geo ] ) probably exclude the damped ly@xmath2 ( dla ) system observed in a as the lensing agent , thus excluding the @xmath28 result .",
    "the primary aim of this study is to compare ionization conditions and metallicities in clouds at @xmath30 for the two loss toward he11041805 .",
    "we use new _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , and ground - based _ new technology telescope _ ( _ ntt _ ) and keck spectra .",
    "the civ systems observed in the uv and optical spectra of a and b at redshifts close to @xmath31 are very well suited to determine whether this gas is indeed photoionized : it can be assumed that they are associated with the high - density gas giving rise to the dla system observed in a at @xmath32 and have therefore a common chemical history .",
    "consequently , the _ relative _ element abundances should be the same in all these systems . since the dla gas is expected to be opaque to the ionizing radiation",
    ", it is possible to derive these element abundances without ionization corrections .    to investigate the issue of ionization in the civ systems",
    ", we have used the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland @xcite ) and the ionizing radiation field proposed by haardt & madau ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have assumed that this radiation field also ionizes the gas that gives rise to the strong ovi absorption observed along both loss .",
    "we have made a distinction between two gas phases with different ionization states : a low ionization phase , where both mgii and civ absorption occur , and a high ionization phase , where ovi but weak civ absorption occurs .",
    "the photoionization models for each of these two gas phases are constrained by the observed column density ratios @xmath3(civ ) to @xmath3(mgii ) and @xmath3(ovi ) to @xmath3(nv ) , respectively .",
    "our paper is organized basically in two parts : estimation of the metal abundances in the dla gas , and photoionization models for the civ systems .",
    "the spectra are described in   [ sec_obs ] .",
    "in   [ sec_abs ] we describe the line fitting method used , and discuss the important role played by the continuum fitting to the _ hst _ spectra .",
    "  [ sec_abu ] is devoted to the metal abundances determined for the dla system observed in qso component a.   [ sec_geo ] presents possible physical scenarios for the civ systems observed in a and b based on their association with the dla system and on the line profiles .",
    "the cloudy models and the resulting physical parameters for the civ and ovi absorbers are described in   [ sec_ion ] .",
    "finally , we outline our conclusions in   [ sec_con ] .",
    "an overview of the spectra used in this paper is displayed in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "we now detail the observations .",
    "uv spectra of he 11041805 a and b were taken in november 1995 with the faint object spectrograph onboard the _ hubble space telescope_. target acquisition and spectroscopy were done using grating g270h with the red detector and the @xmath33 aperture .",
    "this configuration yields a spectral resolution of fwhm @xmath34  and a wavelength coverage from 2222  to 3277  ( schneider et al .",
    "@xcite ) . total integration times of 1790 and 6690 seconds for qso component a and b , respectively , resulted in variance weighted spectra of maximum signal - to - noise ratios s / n @xmath35 ( a ) and @xmath36 per @xmath37  pixel .",
    "optical spectra of he 11041805 a and b were taken in january and february 1997 with the keck high resolution spectrograph hires ( vogt et al .",
    "@xcite ) and an 0.86 slit at fwhm = 6.6 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "they range from 3620 to 6080  . a full description of the observations and extraction method , as well as the spectra themselves will be presented elsewhere . in short",
    ", an image rotator was used to keep the slit off the second image , and as close as possible to the parallactic angle .",
    "the continua were matched by using the brighter a image continuum as a template , i.e. , the continuum points of the b image spectrum were , in a sense , `` stapled '' to the a image continuum .",
    "this was done using polynomial fits in such a way that differences between the continua on scales larger than at average 300 km  s@xmath5 are divided out , but regions smaller than that retain their differences between the loss .",
    "the typical absorption line or absorption complexes between the spectra ( which were omitted from the fit anyway ) are not affected as can be seen from the strong differences in the metal lines despite the very similar ly@xmath2 forest .",
    "we have also taken special care to omit the metal absorption line complexes from the continuum points , to be sure that we do not wipe out the differences .",
    "one - sigma arrays were derived from the poissonian photon error , and rebinned onto the 0.04  / pixel constant wavelength scale .",
    "optical spectra of he 11041805 a and b were obtained in february 1996 with the echelle spectrograph of emmi on the eso _ new technology telescope _ in the red medium dispersion mode under subarcsecond seeing conditions .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 3910 to 8290  .",
    "both images were simultaneously centered in a @xmath38 slit .",
    "grating # 9 , grism 3 as cross - disperser , a f/5.2 camera and a tek @xmath39 ccd were used .",
    "this ccd provides @xmath40 m pixels , corresponding to @xmath41 in the sky .",
    "the total integration time was 16 hours .",
    "the echelle orders were optimally extracted with a version of the extraction algorithm used in paper i , modified to extract cross - dispersed spectra .",
    "the algorithm attempts to reduce the statistical noise in the extracted spectra to a minimum , and allows the correct separation of the two seeing profiles .",
    "it basically consists of the following steps : ( i ) a variance ( poisson statistics , read - out noise and cosmics ) is assigned to each pixel . for each flat - fielded two - dimensional spectrum ,",
    "two gaussians of common width are simultaneously fitted to the profiles at each wavelength channel along the previously defined echelle orders using the levenberg - marquardt method ( press et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( ii ) the variation of the width and the position of the brighter component with respect to the orders in the dispersion direction is then fitted with low order polynomials ; ( iii ) step ( i ) is repeated , this time with fixed width and position  given by the polynomial fits  thus allowing only the amplitudes to vary .",
    "the final , variance - weighted coadded spectra have fwhm @xmath42 to @xmath43  and maximum s / n @xmath44 ( a ) and @xmath45 ( b ) . the continuum level was estimated separately in each order  skipping corrections for the blaze function  and for each qso image .",
    "this was done by fitting low - order polynomials and cubic splines to featureless spectral regions .",
    "additional fwhm @xmath46  resolution spectra of both qso images taken with the 3.9 m _",
    "anglo - australian telescope _ and covering the wavelength range 3170 to 7570  were also used .",
    "they have already been presented in paper i.      special care has been taken to re - define the absolute zero point of the wavelength scale in the _ hst _ spectra .",
    "an off - center position of the targets in the aperture of the fos may cause differences in the wavelength scale between the a and b spectra . by measuring wavelength positions of the galactic mgii @xmath47 lines , and assuming that this absorption takes place in the same cloud along both loss we found an offset of @xmath48  .",
    "this correction was applied to the b spectrum . additionally , an overlapping 100  wide spectral region around @xmath49 = 3220  in the _ hst _ and _ aat _ spectra allowed for a correction of the fos wavelength scale to vacuum - heliocentric values .",
    "this was done by comparing the central wavelength differences of absorption lines in the a spectrum thought not to be blended . a relatively small correction of @xmath50  was then applied to both _ hst _",
    "owing to the low fos resolution , line blending introduces a serious problem when performing continuum fitting .",
    "this is particularly marked in the ly@xmath2 forest , because of the lack of spectral regions free of absorption lines .",
    "for this reason , we decided to first determine the _ absorbed _ continuum  clearly dominated by two optically thin lyman - limit systems ( lls ) at @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the dla system ( a ) and a lls at @xmath1 ( b)before describing the intrinsic qso continuum .",
    "both spectra were corrected for galactic extinction ( seaton @xcite ) with e(@xmath53)=0.09 ( reimers et al .",
    "the lyman edges , arising from the superposition and blending of corresponding high - order hi lyman series lines , were modeled with voigt profiles convolved with a fwhm = 2  gaussian describing the instrumental profile .",
    "the optical depth @xmath54 at each lyman break , given by the ratio of the extrapolated continuum to the lyman one , determined @xmath3(hi ) , whereas @xmath55 was mainly constrained by the shape of the edge .",
    "these parameters are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the total optical depth at each lls is given by the lyman continuum and the lines of the lyman series .",
    "note that the flux for @xmath56  in the b spectrum is not completely absorbed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic qso continuum of he 11041805 a and b in the _ hst _ spectra for @xmath57  was found to be very well represented by two power laws ( @xmath58 ) with a break at @xmath49 = 2917  . to determine the power law parameters ,",
    "a maximum likelihood fit was performed , matching simultaneously the intrinsic and the hi absorption continuum with the observed flux at selected absorption - free spectral regions including some regions dominated by significant hi absorption lines .",
    "this led to the best - fit spectral indices @xmath59 , @xmath60 for a , and @xmath61 , @xmath62 for b ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we believe this continuum estimation is a good one , since an extrapolation to longer wavelengths fits the scaled _ aat _ spectra to well within 1@xmath63 in regions of low ly@xmath2 line density . moreover , expected emission lines by ly@xmath2 , nv , and ovi stand out well against the continuum as can be seen in fig .",
    "division of the flux by this continuum resulted in the normalized _ hst _ spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "the different continuum slopes of a and b , already pointed out in the discovery paper , might be a consequence of qso component a being microlensed ( wisotzki et al .",
    "furthermore , we find the spectrum of a bluewards of ly@xmath2 emission to be softer than that of b , in agreement with the variability in the spectral slopes reported by wisotzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from the analysis of low resolution observations in the optical range made one and two years before ours . however , an alternative explanation for the different slopes might be differential reddening by dust grains in the dla system observed in a , a possibility recently considered for the gravitationally lensed qso 0957 + 561 ( zuo et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      in this section",
    "we describe the line fitting procedures used to obtain column densities of lines associated with the @xmath1 absorption systems in a and b. in general , this is a nontrivial task because of the limited resolution of our spectra other than keck hires , so that assumptions concerning line widths must be made .",
    "the lines were modelled with voigt profiles .",
    "we distinguish between maximum likelihood fits , performed to lines in the keck and _ ntt _ spectra , and `` interactive '' fits , performed to lines in the _ aat _ and _ hst _ spectra ( aside from hi lines ) .",
    "to determine column densities @xmath3 and doppler parameters @xmath55 of lines in the keck hires spectra , we @xmath64-fitted voigt profiles convolved with the instrumental profile to lines in the keck spectra using the midas program fitlyman ( fontana & ballester @xcite ) .",
    "these lines lie longward of ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "line parameters , i.e. , rest - frame vacuum wavelengths , damping constants and oscillator strengths , were taken from morton ( @xcite ) , and from verner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for lines with revised @xmath65-values .",
    "most of the column density errors @xmath66 range from 0.01 to 0.10 dex ; however , the smoothing introduced by rebinning the 1@xmath63-arrays sometimes underestimates the true flux uncertainties , making @xmath66 systematically too low .",
    "thus , we made the following correction to the fit errors : for each line , we measured the amount of smoothing by calculating the ratio of the flux standard deviation from 41-pixel wide featureless regions in the data to the sigma from the error array . in the ( few ) cases where this ratio was larger than one ,",
    "@xmath66 was corrected by this factor .",
    "clearly , this applies only to unsaturated , resolved lines ; a similar treatment to non - resolved complexes is less obvious because the @xmath66 s result from a more complicated hessian matrix , and are no longer independent .",
    "we did not allow for this effect .",
    "special attention must be given to the fits of lines associated with the dla system observed in the spectrum of qso component a because they will determine the metal abundances .",
    "to look for possible hidden saturation , we used the apparent optical depth method to compare apparent column densities @xmath67 of different transitions of a given ion in velocity space ( e.g. eq . [ 1 ] in lu et al .",
    "@xcite ; savage & sembach  @xcite , for a description of the method ) .",
    "although some lines are probably saturated ( e.g. alii @xmath68 ) , in most of the cases where more than one transition is available we do not find significantly saturated structures , and the agreement between the fit and integration results is remarkable ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "in the _ ntt _ spectrum , the mgii profiles at @xmath31 are slightly asymmetric , suggesting that this system will also split into more components at higher resolution .",
    "consequently , we fitted four - component voigt profiles to these lines , with @xmath55-parameters fixed at values found for the siii lines in the keck spectra .      at even lower resolution",
    ", one can not expect to recognize the line profiles properly ; hence , to derive column densities of lines in the _ hst _ and _ aat _ spectra , turbulence dominated line broadening was considered .",
    "voigt profiles were interactively created and superimposed to the spectra using xvoigt ( mar & bailey  @xcite ) , while attempting to minimize the residuals .",
    "the redshift and doppler widths used to create such line profiles were those found in a _",
    "second _ fit with fitlyman of lines present both in the _ aat _ and keck spectra .",
    "lines with asymmetric profiles were considered to be _ single _ , and the total column densities were fixed to the known keck - values . in this fashion , the low and high - ionization species were distinguished using `` low - resolution '' doppler parameters determined by the fits to feii @xmath69 ( @xmath70 km  s@xmath5 ) and civ @xmath71 ( @xmath72 km  s@xmath5 ) lines in a , respectively . for b , the lines used were alii @xmath68 ( @xmath70 km  s@xmath5 ) and civ @xmath71 ( @xmath73 km  s@xmath5 ) .    to estimate the uncertainties of our column densities we smoothed and rebinned lines observed in the _ ntt _ spectra to _ hst _ fos resolution , and re - computed column densities with the procedure described above .",
    "the new column densities showed deviations of the order 0.1 to 0.2 dex from the original , better determined values .",
    "another source of error is our limited ability to de - blend metal lines from ly@xmath2 forest lines . on the other hand , most column densities of transitions in the uv that contribute to the metal abundances",
    "are based on one line in the _ hst _ spectra and another in the _ aat _ ones , e.g. , cii @xmath741036,1334 ; oi @xmath74988,1302 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . if these two effects compensate , we think that taking @xmath75 dex for these ions is appropriate .",
    "we defined 3 @xmath63 detection limits for metal lines in the _ hst _ and _ aat _ spectra according to the formula ( caulet  @xcite ) @xmath76 where fwhm is the width of the spectral point spread function and @xmath77s / n@xmath21 is the mean local signal to noise expected at the position of the line ( measured as the inverse standard deviation of the normalized flux in small featureless stretches adjacent to the line ) .",
    "they range between @xmath78 and @xmath79  in the b spectra .      to derive more accurate column densities for hi , we used the normalized _ hst _ spectra .",
    "because they completely cover the rest - frame spectral range down to 912  for the @xmath1 systems , it is possible to measure @xmath3(hi ) in both spectra more accurately than in previous studies on damped systems , by using higher lyman series transitions .",
    "we simultaneously fitted two - component voigt profiles to 11 resolved hi lines in the normalized spectra of a and b using fitlyman . the fit solutions to lines in b",
    "were constrained by @xmath80 at the lyman edge .",
    "we estimate the neutral hydrogen column density of the dla gas ( spectrum a ) to be log@xmath3(hi ) = 20.85@xmath810.01 ; for the lls ( b ) we obtained log@xmath3(hi ) = 17.57@xmath810.10 .",

    ", we see that the low ions track each other quite closely , suggesting they occur in the same gas clouds .",
    "the whole profile is characterized by one cloud at @xmath86 km  s@xmath5 with the strongest absorption , one cloud at @xmath87 km  s@xmath5 with the smallest column densities , and two clouds with intermediate column density clouds lying in between .",
    "this `` edge - leading asymmetry '' seems to be a common feature of low - ionization absorption lines associated with damped ly@xmath2 systems .",
    "it has been variously interpreted as a consequence of absorption by rotating gaseous disks ( e.g. , wolfe et al .",
    "@xcite ) or as the signature of merging protogalactic clumps in hierarchical structure formation ( rauch et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "the different column density ratios at each velocity indicate clouds with different physical conditions ( gas density , metallicity , or even ionization ) within 70 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "remarkably , and despite the _ independent _ fits performed to each ion profile , we obtain fit solutions that uniquely characterize each cloud in redshift and broadening parameter ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] and fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",

    "only four - component voigt profile fits succeeded .",
    "unfortunately , the poor s / n at the position of the siiv lines and contamination by ly@xmath2 forest lines do not allow a clear comparison with the civ profiles .",
    "we decided not to fit these siiv lines .",
    "instead , we give upper limits for column densities based on the apparent optical depth method .",
    "the high ion profiles do not exactly track the low ion profiles : the data rather suggest at least part of the civ absorption ( velocity component 1 ) occurs in clouds without low ionization species .",
    "on the other hand , civ velocity components 2 to 4 show a certain resemblance to the edge - leading asymmetry of the low ion profiles ; however , our fit solution yields relatively large @xmath55-values , suggesting that civ , regardless of which line broadening mechanism dominates  thermal or turbulent gas motion",
    " occurs in hotter gas regions than the low ion clouds .",

    "[ fig12 ] for the haardt & madau ( solid line ) and a power - law radiation field ( dashed line ) . at the minimum value of @xmath22 allowed by the observations @xmath211 , and for a wide range of gas metallicities ,",
    "cloudy predicts @xmath158(civ)@xmath212 , in agreement with the observed value .",
    "however , at higher ionization parameters , e.g. , @xmath3(ovi)/@xmath3(nv ) @xmath213 or @xmath214 ( corresponding to a 2@xmath63 significant non - detection of nv ) , @xmath3(civ ) becomes @xmath215% smaller , independently of @xmath165 .",
    "this result in turn indicates that at least part of the observed civ arises in highly ionized gas , with the remaining contribution coming from the low - ionization gas phase .",
    "the present _ hst _ data do not enable us to quantitatively assess this issue and we can only conclude that civ is likely to occur in both phases .",
    "collisional ionization of gas in thermal equilibrium can also reproduce the observed @xmath3(ovi)/@xmath3(nv ) ratio at @xmath216 k if one assumes solar relative abundances ( sutherland & dopita @xcite ) , so we can not rule out this process as responsible for ionizing ov into ovi .",
    "in such a case , the line broadening would be mostly due to macro - turbulence . collisionally ionized ovi gas in a lyman - limit system at @xmath217 has been recently proposed by kirkman & tytler ( @xcite ) , who detect both civ and ovi at the same redshift in high resolution data .",
    "these authors favor collisional ionization due to the high kinetic temperatures implied by the line widths of both ions . in the case of he 11041805 ab , additional , higher resolution ( @xmath218 ) uv spectra are needed , in order to finally discriminate between collisional and photoionization as the dominant ionization mechanism in the ovi - phase .",
    "we outline our conclusions as follows :    1 .   the damped ly@xmath2 system observed at @xmath32 in the ultraviolet and optical spectra of he 11041805 a has a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath158(hi)@xmath219 .",
    "the @xmath220 km  s@xmath5 resolution line profiles show that this high - density gas is distributed in four clouds spanning @xmath221 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "since the low ionization and aliii line profiles are observed to track fairly well , these ions are likely to arise in common clouds .",
    "their @xmath55-values are consistent if the broadening mechanism is _ not _ purely thermal .",
    "the civ line profiles show that at least some of civ absorption occurs in clouds with no singly ionized species .",
    "we find a metallicity of @xmath16 and a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath222 , based on [ zn / h]@xmath223 and [ cr / h]@xmath224 .",
    "other element abundances are : [ c / h]@xmath225 , [ n / h]@xmath226 , [ o / h]@xmath227 , [ mg / h]@xmath228 , [ al / h]@xmath229 , [ si / h]@xmath223 , [ ti / h]@xmath230 , [ mn / h]@xmath231 , [ fe / h]@xmath232 and [ ni / h]@xmath233 .",
    "the o / n ratio , 8 times larger than the solar value , is consistent with galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "however , the observed elemental abundance pattern must be modified by condensation into dust grains given ( a ) the underabundance of cr and ti relative to zn ; and ( b ) the variation of the abundance ratios of these and other refractory elements among different clouds associated with the dla system .",
    "photoionization by the metagalactic radiation field proposed by haardt & madau ( @xcite ) implies that the lyman - limit system observed at @xmath129 in the spectra of he 11041805 b and the three further civ systems observed at similar redshifts in a and b all belong to the same category of absorbers , namely small ( los sizes 0.5 to 1.6 kpc ) and relatively dense ( @xmath234 @xmath15 ) clouds where both civ and mgii absorption occurs .",
    "3 .   we find evidence for the lls and one further civ absorption system observed in b to have lower metallicities than observed in the dla gas , @xmath235 .",
    "this result is significant at the 2 @xmath63 confidence level if the column density uncertainties are not underestimated .",
    "4 .   in the context of galaxy formation ,",
    "the observed hi column densities suggest that los b intercepts gas in the `` halo '' of a protogalaxy at @xmath85 = 1.66 , while los a crosses its denser , central gas regions .",
    "if this picture is correct , then we are observing metal - poor gas in the halo of such a galaxy , compared to the high - density gas ( within a transverse separation of @xmath1378  @xmath236 kpc ) .",
    "this in turn suggests regions of different star - formation rates or , alternatively , metal enrichment through gas transfer from the inner to the outer regions of the protogalaxy still in early stages .",
    "the presence of a highly ionized gas phase giving rise to the observed ovi absorption of similar strength in both spectra is evident .",
    "if photoionization is assumed , the observed @xmath237 , and the non - detection of nv implies large ( @xmath238@xmath239 kpc ) , low - density ( @xmath13710@xmath240 @xmath15 ) clouds where strong ovi but weak civ absorption occurs .",
    "on the basis of these results , we suggest that this highly ionized gas surrounds the clouds giving rise to the damped ly@xmath2 and lyman - limit systems .",
    "such an extended low - density ovi phase confirms the predictions of simulations of protogalactic clumps ( rauch et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    concerning the negative gradient in metallicity from gas crossed by los a to gas crossed by los b ,",
    "it must be pointed out that such an effect , if real , does not necessarily support the disk / halo scenario .",
    "indeed , it is still not clear whether present - day rotating disk - like galaxies should have had a similar appearance in their early stages of formation , nor is it well understood what we should define as protogalactic `` halos '' .",
    "a good deal of progress is being made to resolve this paradigm : a link between metallicity and kinematics can improve our understanding of dla systems ( wolfe et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; hydrodynamic simulations of merging protogalactic clumps are capable of explaining the large velocity spans seen in this class of absorption systems ( haehnelt et al .",
    "here we have demonstrated the powerful tool which double loss can provide us . a convincing interpretation of our result , however , has to await a larger sample of such cases .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the scenario of small and compact civ clouds surrounded by extended ovi gas can indeed be theoretically understood and is in good agreement with the predictions of a cold - dark - matter based model ( rauch et al .",
    "furthermore , in a hierarchical structure formation scenario damped ly@xmath2 and lyman limit systems can arise from relatively small ( m@xmath241 m@xmath194 ) merging protogalactic clumps .",
    "even if the sizes derived using our photoionization models are not representative of transverse cloud sizes , the similar civ line profiles and equivalent widths in a and b are still consistent with filamentary structures , which is also a prediction of hierarchical structure formation . such a correlation between line profiles in a and b is , on the other hand , less evident for mgii , implying gas inhomogeneities on spatial scales similar to the separation between loss , and in concordance with mgii arising in smaller regions than civ and ovi .",

    "<S> three of these systems are associated with a damped ly@xmath2 ( dla ) system with log@xmath3(hi ) = 20.85 , which is observed in the ultraviolet spectra of the bright qso image ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other two systems are associated with a lyman - limit system with log@xmath3(hi ) = 17.57 , seen in the fainter image ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the civ and mgii line profiles in a resemble those in the b spectra , and span @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the angular separation @xmath6 between a and b corresponds to a transverse proper separation of @xmath7  h@xmath8 kpc , for @xmath9 and a lens at @xmath10 .    assuming that the _ relative _ metal abundances in these absorption systems are the same as observed in the dla system , we find that the observed @xmath3(civ)/@xmath3(mgii ) ratios imply ionization parameters of @xmath11 to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these clouds should be small ( 0.51.6 kpc with a hydrogen density @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 ) and relatively highly ionized . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption systems to b are found to have a metallicity 0.63 times lower than the metallicity of the gas giving rise to the dla system , @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> we detect ovi at @xmath17 in both qso spectra , but no associated nv . </S>",
    "<S> our model calculations lead us to conclude that the civ clouds should be surrounded by large ( @xmath18 kpc ) highly ionized low - density clouds ( @xmath19 @xmath15 ) , in which ovi , but only weak civ absorption occurs . in this state </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 reproduces the observed ratio of @xmath3(ovi)/@xmath3(nv ) @xmath21 60 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results are discussed in view of the disk / halo and hierarchical structure formation models . </S>"
