    "x - ray binaries are classified into low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "187 lmxbs have been discovered in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "lmxbs are binaries consisting of a low - mass companion star and a main compact star ( a black hole or a weakly magnetized neutron star ( ns ) ) , and thus they are old systems .",
    "hmxbs are binaries whose companion is a high - mass star .",
    "symbiotic x - ray binaries ( syxbs ) are the system of a compact star with a red giant , and previously defined as lmxbs @xcite . @xcite and @xcite detected 6 syxbs .",
    "in addition , @xcite newly listed 5 candidate systems of syxbs , although 1rxj 180431.1273932 and 2xmm j174016.0290337 were reported as cataclysmic variables in masetti  ( 2012ab ) , and igr j163934643 was identified as a hmxb @xcite . comparing syxbs with general lmxbs , one of the remarkable features is long ns spin periods ; for example , gx 1 + 4 and gx 1954 + 31 have 110157 s ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath5 5 h @xcite , respectively",
    ". therefore , understanding the evolution of nss and lmxbs , detailed investigation of syxbs is very important . when lmxbs have the luminosity of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 in the high / soft state , compton corona is suggested to exist around the ns and the x - ray spectrum is often described by the soft and hard components ; the former component is disk black body ( dbb ) and the latter is comptonization of black body ( bb ) from the ns surface @xcite .",
    "as the x - ray luminosity decreases below 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 , lmxbs become the low / hard state in which the x - ray spectrum becomes harder ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "syxbs have been often observed in the low / hard state .",
    "however , the x - ray spectrum of syxbs has not been systematically studied , and thus the origin of x - ray radiation is not fully understood .",
    "the purpose of this study is to explore the x - ray spectrum and variability of syxbs in the low / hard state in terms of the following points ; how the x - ray spectral features of syxb are , and how the temperature and optical depth of compton cloud around the compact star ( most cases are the ns ) and accreting stream are .",
    "4u 1700 + 24 is one of ns - syxbs and it is nearest from the earth among ns - syxbs ; the distance is @xmath5 420 pc .",
    "this object was observed with xmm - newton and suzaku when it was in the low / hard state with a luminosity of 10@xmath810@xmath9 ( 0.310 kev ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the x - ray spectrum was reproduced by the combination of the inverse compton of dbb for the soft component and that of bb for the hard component , together with some low - energy lines .    here , we observed an syxb igr j161942810 with suzaku .",
    "this object consists of a m2 iii star and probably a ns , and the distance from the earth is @xmath5 3.7 kpc . it was first observed in the hard x - ray band above 20 kev with integral on 2nd ibis survey ( @xcite ; see also the 3rd ibis survey of @xcite ) and ibis extragalactic survey , and the flux was reported to be @xmath5 3@xmath1010@xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath1 in 20100 kev @xcite .",
    "this source was also observed with the x - ray telescope ( xrt , 0.310 kev ; @xcite ) on swift , and the flux was @xmath5 4.4@xmath1010@xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath1 in 210 kev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 210 kev luminosity is @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 . since the observational dates and exposures of the integral and swift observations are different , in this paper , we report the results of the 0.850 kev wide - band and simultaneous observation by suzaku and discuss the physical state of this object by comparing with an syxb 4u 1700 + 24 and typical lmxbs such as aql x-1 and 4u 0614 + 091 .",
    "igr j161942810 was observed with suzaku on february 56 , 2009 .",
    "the net exposure time was about 46 ks .",
    "suzaku has four x - ray ccd cameras called the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis-0 , xis-1 , xis-2 , and xis-3 ) which are sensitive in 0.212 kev .",
    "the xis-0 , xis-2 and xis-3 are front - illumination ( fi ) ccds and while the xis-1 is back - illumination ( bi ) one @xcite . due to the damage ,",
    "the xis-2 has not been operated since november 9 , 2006 .",
    "suzaku has a non - imaging instrument called the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) @xcite .",
    "the hxd has two types of detectors , the si - pin photo diodes ( pin ) and the gso scintillators , which are sensitive in 10600 kev .",
    "igr j161942810 was observed at the hxd nominal position .",
    "the xis was operated in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 editing modes and the normal clocking mode .",
    "the signal was detected in 0.850 kev with the xis and hxd - pin .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we chose good time intervals ( gtis ) when both xis and hxd - pin were active , and obtained the exposure of 36 ks .",
    "the observed source count rates after subtracting the background were 1.44 and 1.51 counts s@xmath1 in 0.810 kev by xis - fi and xis - bi , respectively , and 0.03 counts s@xmath1 in 2050 kev by hxd - pin .",
    "we analyzed the cleaned event file version 2.3 by using analysis software package heasoft 6.10 and the calibration database caldb latest on 2011 april 1 .",
    "we defined the source region as a circle with a radius of 2@xmath16.7 from the source position , which we determine by looking at the xis image .",
    "the background region is taken as an annulus with a radius of 3@xmath16.35@xmath16.0 from the source position .",
    "we generated the redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) by xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen of ftools .",
    "we added the xis-0 and xis-3 spectra by mathpha of ftools . also , we multiplied rmf and arf by using marfrmf of ftools per each detector and we used these files as the rsp file .",
    "we added the xis-0 and xis-3 rsp files by addrmf of ftools .",
    "we extracted the hxd - pin spectrum from the cleaned event file version 2.3 by using hxdpinxbpi of ftools , where contribution of cosmic x - ray background is subtracted assuming the spectral shape of exponential cut - off power law ( photon index = 1.29 , cut - off energy = 40 kev , flux at 1 kev = 9.412 @xmath17 photons kev@xmath1 @xmath12 s@xmath1 fov@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "for the non x - ray background ( nxb ) , we used the tuned nxb file @xcite , and the response file ae_hxd_pinhxnome5_20080716.rsp was used .    during this observation ,",
    "the hxd temperature was high and the lower energy band of the hxd - pin suffered from noise events .",
    "therefore , we analyzed the hxd - pin data above 20 kev when we fitted the spectra .",
    "the cross - normalization factor of 1.18 is introduced to explain the absolute flux difference to the xis ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/analysis/abc/abc.html ) .",
    "we analyzed the xis - fi , bi and hxd - pin spectra by using xspec version 12.7.0 .",
    "hereafter , the error is estimated as a 90% confidence range ( @xmath18 = 2.7 ) for one parameter .",
    "first of all , we tried to fit the spectra with the model  1 `` phabs@xmath10power - law '' . in this model ,",
    "`` phabs '' represents the galactic interstellar absorption with the cross section data of @xcite .",
    "free parameters are the absorption column density @xmath19 , the photon index @xmath20 , and the normalization of the power - law .",
    "we show the fitting result of the model  1 in table  [ tab1 ] and figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this model does not reproduce the observed spectra with a reduced @xmath21 of 5.35 ( d.o.f .",
    "positive residuals are seen below 1 kev and at 26 kev , and a large negative residual appears above 6 kev . to represent the high - energy negative residual , we applied `` phabs@xmath10comptt '' which is the same model by @xcite .",
    "the comptt component models comptonized radiation of bb seed photons @xcite . as the result",
    ", the model can reproduce the spectra above 10 kev with the parameters of the seed - photon bb temperature of 0.74 kev and the optical depth of compton cloud of @xmath5 0.1 .",
    "however , the low - energy residual still remains , and @xmath22 is 1.48 ( d.o.f = 589 ) thus not formally acceptable .",
    "second , we fitted the spectra with a conventional model for the low / hard state of lmxbs ; `` phabs(diskbb + compps ( seed = bb ) ) '' ( model  2 ) .",
    "the diskbb ( dbb ) model represents multi - color disk blackbody ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "parameters are the inner - radius temperature of the accretion disk @xmath23 and normalization@xmath24 . in the dbb ( and the following compps ( seed = dbb ) ) model ,",
    "the obtained normalization@xmath24 can be converted into the physical value of the disk inner radius @xmath25 with normalization@xmath24 = ( @xmath25 ( km))@xmath26 / ( 0.37 ( 10 kpc))@xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an inclination angle of the disk and the source distance of 3.7 kpc is assumed . since @xmath28 of this source is uncertain , we assume at 60@xmath29 considering the fact that the eclipse has not been observed for this object . if @xmath28 is measured as 0@xmath29 or 85@xmath29 , the @xmath25 value in this paper should be multiplied by a factor of 0.5 or 5.7 ( other parameters such as the temperature and optical depth of the compton cloud are independent from @xmath28 in the dbb and compps ( seed = dbb ) models ) .",
    "the compps model @xcite is physically the same as the above comptt , and it can estimate the radiation radius of the seed photon .",
    "free parameters are bb temperature @xmath30 , the optical depth of compton cloud @xmath31 and normalization@xmath32 . since the comptonizing electron temperature @xmath33 can not be determined from the observed spectra , it is fixed to 100 kev ; in fact , this value represents the lower limit of @xmath34 90 kev .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tab2 ] , the model  2 well reproduced the observed spectra with a reduced @xmath21 of 1.13 ( d.o.f .",
    "the improvement from the model  1 ( the @xmath21 difference with @xmath35-statistic value of 183 ) is significant more than the 3@xmath36 level . however , the inner radius of the accretion disk becomes @xmath37 km assuming the distance of 3.7 kpc and the inclination angle of 60@xmath29 .",
    "this is not likely since it is smaller than the ns radius .    instead of the dbb model",
    ", we next tried astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) model which represents the emission from collisionally - ionized diffuse gas ( http://atomdb.org/ ) , since the accreting stream originally from the stellar wind of the red giant may keep hot diffuse gas rather than forming the optically - thick disk .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab3 ] , this model `` phabs(apec + compps ( seed = bb ) ) '' can also represent the spectral shape with a reduced @xmath21 of 1.14 ( d.o.f .",
    "= 588 ) apparently",
    ". however , due to the lack of fe - l emission features around 1 kev , the spectral continuum below 2 kev requires too low abundance of @xmath6 0.004 solar value or too high temperature @xmath5 40 kev when the abundance is fixed at 0.3 solar value .",
    "therefore , we think that the model  2 with either of dbb or apec model can not be physically accepted . since the unrealistically small emission radius of the dbb may suggest the soft emission component comes from the ns surface , we applied the model  2 of `` phabs(bb + compps ( seed = bb ) ) '' .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tab2 ] and figure  [ fig2 ] , the model can reproduce the spectra with a reduced @xmath21 of 1.14 ( d.o.f .",
    "= 588 ) , and the obtained parameters are physically reasonable ; the bb radius is @xmath5 1.7 km with the temperature of @xmath5 0.4 kev .",
    "overestimation of the disk temperature may be another possibility to fake the too small disk inner radius .",
    "the disk temperature would be much lower and the dbb photons would be upscattered by comptonization into the soft x - ray band .",
    "then , we also fitted the spectra with the model  3 `` phabs(compps ( seed = dbb ) + compps ( seed = bb ) ) '' , where the dbb in the model  2 is replaced by the compps ( seed = dbb ) .",
    "the shape of the compton cloud and the electron temperature @xmath33 are assumed to be spherical and 100 kev , respectively , the same as the compps ( seed = bb ) .",
    "the model  3 can reproduce the observed model as well as the model  2 with a reduced @xmath22 of 1.14 ( d.o.f = 587 ) , as shown in table  [ tab4 ] and figure  [ fig3 ] . in this model , the parameters of the seed dbb can not be well constrained . when @xmath38 0.1 kev , @xmath23 could be constrained from the spectral curvature below 1 kev , but the interstellar absorption prevents us to constrain it .",
    "nevertheless , the error region contains the parameter set that the disk temperature is low , the optical depth of compton cloud is large , and the disk inner radius is reasonable to be @xmath34 10 km .",
    "therefore , this model gives a possible solution of the spectral modeling .",
    "note that the origin of the seed photons with the temperature of @xmath5 0.1 kev is not necessarily the multi - color disk black - body emission , since the spectral shape of the seed - photon emission is not well determined . on the other hand , the bb temperature for compps ( seed = bb )",
    "is determined by the apparent concave shape of the spectra around 10 kev .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of @xmath30 and @xmath39 is smaller unlike the case of compps ( seed = dbb ) .",
    "we concluded that the model  2 ( bb ) or the model 3 is physically possible to reproduce the time - average spectra .",
    "the observed 210 kev flux and luminosity described in table  [ tab2 ] , [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] are @xmath40 erg s@xmath1 and @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 , respectively , which are comparable to those of the previous observations @xcite .",

    "the x - ray spectrum can be described by the model  2 ( bb ) `` phabs(bb + compps ( seed = bb ) ) '' or the model  3 `` phabs(compps ( seed = dbb ) + compps ( seed = bb ) ) '' .",
    "the hard compps ( seed = bb ) component represents the energy band above 2 kev and gives the seed - photon parameters of @xmath107 kev , @xmath108 and @xmath109 m. the soft energy band is reproduced by either the raw bb ( @xmath110 0.4 kev , @xmath111 1.7 km ) or compps ( seed = dbb ) ( @xmath112 0.1 kev , @xmath113 , @xmath114 75 km but with large uncertainties ) . during the net exposure of 46 ks , the flux varied by a factor of 4 in the xis band , and the spectral shape becomes harder when the flux decreased .",
    "there was also a time when the count rate only below 2 kev decreased for @xmath5 1000 s ( the `` hard - color '' period ) .",
    "the power spectrum of the light curve shows the power - law shape without any significant periodic features . as described in ",
    "[ sec : ana_ave ] , @xmath39 and @xmath30 of the hard compps ( seed = bb ) component are well constrained by the spectral analysis , and thus we discuss these parameters .",
    "we obtained @xmath39 of igr j161942810 to be @xmath5 700 m. this value is smaller than the ns radius of @xmath5 10 km , indicating that the bb emission comes from a part of the ns surface .",
    "we compare this issue with an syxb 4u 1700 + 24 and typical transient and persistent lmxbs , aql x-1 and 4u 0614 + 091 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab6 ] summarizes the x - ray luminosity , @xmath30 , and @xmath39 of these objects together with those of igr j161942810 .",
    "since the parameters of the hard compps ( seed = bb ) component are almost independent from the modeling , we listed those of the model  3 .",
    "note that the spectrum of aql x-1 in the high / soft state , that in the low / hard state and that of 4u 0614 + 091 in the low / hard state are fitted with `` diskbb + nthcomp '' , `` diskbb + compps ( seed = bb ) '' , and `` bb + compst '' , respectively , where the nthcomp and compst models also calculate the comptonized emission by @xcite and @xcite . in the case of 4u 0614 + 091",
    ", the comptonized emission of compst is separately treated from the bb model , and the bb radius is considered as the lower limit without including the contribution of the seed photons .",
    "considering the spectral features of the syxbs and lmxbs , we suggested that the hard energy band of x - ray spectra of the ns - lmxb in the low / hard state can be explained commonly by the hard comptonized bb emission from the ns surface .",

    "the temperature value @xmath30 of the syxbs is @xmath5 1 kev and higher than that of the lmxbs , although that of aql x-1 in the high / soft state is even higher .",
    "therefore , to irradiate the observed luminosity in the low / hard state , the syxbs have the smaller radiation region on the ns surface with the higher seed - photon temperature , compared with the lmxbs .",
    "we suggest that the difference of luminosity - dependence of @xmath39 and @xmath30 is due to the different magnetic field strength @xmath121 between lmxbs and syxbs .",
    "we speculate that the magnetic field of syxbs is stronger than that of lmxbs , and thus the matter from the donor star is caught by the magnetic field and accreted to both poles along a line of magnetic force when the accreted rate is low .",
    "this hypothesis is also described in @xcite . for lmxbs , the magnetic field",
    "is generally believed to be weak , and thus the accreting stream falls onto the ns boundary layer without effects of the magnetic field .    in order to discuss this possibility , it is important to consider the alfven radius @xmath122 cm , where @xmath123 is a mass of the compact star with the unit of 1 , @xmath124 is the radius of the compact star with a unit of 10@xmath125 cm , @xmath126 is the luminosity with a unit of 10@xmath127 erg s@xmath1 , and @xmath128 is a magnetic moment of the compact star with the units 10@xmath129 g @xmath130 .",
    "an ns with @xmath121 @xmath131 10@xmath132 g , @xmath133",
    "@xmath131 10@xmath125 cm has @xmath128 @xmath131 1 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath118 = 10@xmath134 , 10@xmath7 and 10@xmath135 erg s@xmath1 , @xmath136 becomes 30 km , 8 km , and 2 km , respectively , for @xmath121 @xmath5 10@xmath137 g , and 400 km , 110 km and 30 km , respectively , for @xmath121 @xmath5 10@xmath138 g. within the alfven radius , the accreting matter flows along a magnetic field line and finally falls on the magnetic poles of the compact star .",
    "in the case of a low luminosity and/or a strong magnetic field of syxbs , @xmath136 could be larger than the ns radius and the accreting stream falls on the magnetic pole region which is a small area , leading to a small @xmath39 .",
    "the accreting matter is shocked on the ns surface and then heated up to @xmath5 1 kev . in the case of a high luminosity and/or a weak magnetic field of typical lmxbs",
    ", @xmath136 is similar or smaller than the ns radius and the accreting matter falls on a large portion of the ns surface . as a result of the stefan - boltzmann law , the temperature @xmath30 is not so high as 1 kev .",
    "@xcite estimated the size and raidus of the hot spot , where the matter accrets on the ns surface and emits the x - rays , as @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath133 is the ns radius of 10 km .",
    "when we assume that the observed @xmath39 of @xmath5 700 m corresponds to the hot - spot radius , @xmath136 is calculated as @xmath5 2000 km and @xmath121 becomes @xmath141 g with the luminosity of @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is actually higher than that of typical lmxbs @xmath142 g. if the accreting matter falls on the magnetic poles , the x - ray emission should show pulsation as hmxbs .",
    "however , we could not detect the pulse from igr j161942810 , and also 4u 1700 + 24 ( nagae , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite listed 10 syxbs and candidates .",
    "the x - ray pulse has been detected from several objects ; for example , gx 1 + 4 and 4u 1954 + 31 .",
    "their spin was @xmath143 @xmath5 a few 100 s ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath5 5 h @xcite , which is longer than typical spin periods of lmxbs .",
    "therefore , we speculate that the spin period of igr j161942810 may be too long ( @xmath144 1 h ) to be detected during this observation .",
    "there are also other possibilities to explain the absence of the pulsation that the spin axis just coincides with the magnetic one , it can be wiped out through comptonization by a very hot compton cloud @xcite , or the compact star might be a black hole without a solid surface . to accrete the matter smoothly from @xmath136 to the ns surface , the ns needs to spin slower ( i.e. , have a longer spin period ) than the equilibrium spin period @xmath145@xmath146{r_{\\rm a}^{3}/gm}$ ] , where @xmath147 is a gravitational constant and @xmath148 is an ns mass .",
    "otherwise , the matter is likely to be ejected due to the `` propeller '' effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath149 = 1 h from the above discussion , @xmath136 becomes @xmath150 km .",
    "then , the magnetic field is estimated as @xmath151 10@xmath152 g with the observed luminosity @xmath118 = 7 @xmath10 10@xmath134 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "this upper limit is as large as that of magnetars and also consistent with the value estimated above from the radius of the hot spot . from the analysis of the time - average spectrum ,",
    "the origin of the soft energy component below 2 kev is considered as the emission from the ns surface ( mode  2 ( bb ) ) or the accreting stream ( model  3 )",
    ". the timing analysis does not show significant lags and it is difficult to constrain the geometry furthermore .",
    "if the emission comes from the ns surface , the region of @xmath153 km is larger than that of the hard component ( @xmath5 700 m ) but still smaller than the ns radius .",
    "additionally , the temperature of @xmath154 kev is lower than the hard one @xmath155 kev , and this component may arise from the thermalized matter after accreted at the magnetic poles . on the other hands ,",
    "there are also several predictions about the accreting matter onto magnetic compact objects whether it forms an accretion disk or a shell structure @xcite .",
    "however , the disk inner radius @xmath25 of the model  3 is obtained as 75@xmath74 km and one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated alfven radius @xmath156 2000 km .",
    "this might imply that there exists a disk or shell structure around @xmath136 but @xmath25 obtained by the spectral fitting is underestimated .",
    "in fact , we can not constrain @xmath25 and @xmath23 well or detect any large fraction of the un - comptonized raw emission ( i.e. , small portion of the emission might be injected into the compton cloud and observed ) due to the interstellar absorption as described in  [ sec : ana_ave ] . in terms of the incompatibility between @xmath25 and @xmath136 , the model  2 ( bb )",
    "reproduces the data physically better than the model  3 .    during the `` hard - color '' period of @xmath5 1000 s ,",
    "the source flux decreased only below 2 kev .",
    "the spectrum is well represented by the additional absorber with the column density of @xmath80 @xmath12 and the covering fraction of @xmath83 .",
    "such a behavior is also observed in other x - ray binaries due to a clumpy stellar wind ( e.g. , dips in cyg x-1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the red giant of igr j161942810 might also have the clumpy stellar wind @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the suzaku data of syxb igr j161942810 in the energy range of 0.850 kev , and obtained the results as below .    1 .",
    "the time - average spectrum at the luminosity of @xmath157 erg s@xmath1 was physically represented by the model  2 ( bb ) ( blackbody plus comptonization model ) or the model  3 ( two - comptonizations model ) . in both models , there were two emission components ; the hard component of a comptonized bb emission , and the soft one of either a raw bb or a comptonized emission .",
    "2 .   compared with other",
    "syxb and typical transient and persistent lmxbs in the low / hard state , the hard emission component of the syxbs has the smaller @xmath158 1 km and the higher @xmath110 1 kev .",
    "we propose that this behavior is due to the stronger magnetic field of syxbs than that of the lmxbs , and the accreting stream falls on the magnetic poles of the ns .",
    "the emission region of the soft component is still unclear , since the lower energy band has uncertainties due to the interstellar absorption and there was no time lags observed between soft and hard energy bands .",
    "one possibility ( model  2 ( bb ) ) is that the raw bb emission may arise from the thermalized matter after accreted at the magnetic poles .",
    "the other ( model  3 ) is that the seed photon of the comptonized emission might be injected from small fraction of the accreting stream .",
    "4 .   the light curve showed time variation during the 1-d observation , and it was suggested that the spectrum becomes harder when the source flux decreases .",
    "there was @xmath5 1000-s timing when the flux only below 2 kev decreased .",
    "the spectrum was reproduced by the additional absorber to the time - average one .",
    "the power spectrum did not have any significant periodic features in the time scale from 0.0002 to 0.06 hz .",
