    "hfg1 around what later was recognized to be a 13.7 mag precataclysmic binary star named v664 cas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this stellar close binary system was found to have a period of 13.96 h and brightness amplitude of 1 mag . @xcite",
    "give its distance d = 310 to 950 pc but there is as yet no parallax measurement to determine this with more certainty .",
    "@xcite show that v664 cas is a precataclysmic variable with an orbital period of @xmath1  0.58 days and with the inclination of the rotation axis along a position angle pa  =  177  @xmath3  5 .",
    "the first deep wide  field image of hfg1 in the light of the h@xmath0  and [ n  ii ]  6548  &  6584    nebular emission lines has now been obtained which reveals what appears to be a long trail of emission .",
    "this discovery will be reported here .",
    "such trails have been postulated for stellar systems ejecting material such as the galactic luminous blue variable ( lbv ) p  cygni ( @xcite ; @xcite and refs .",
    "cited therein ) , mira ab ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the large magellanic cloud lbv , r  143 @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that they form as the stars plough through their local interstellar media ( ism ) during periods of mass ejection .",
    "several pne with central binary systems , one star of which has evolved beyond its mira  a agb phase , exhibit bow ",
    "shocks emitting optical emission lines , as they plough through the local ism ( @xcite and refs . therein ) but only the pn , sh2188 , even without a binary system , @xcite has been shown to have a similar , though somewhat less spectacular , tail as the one revealed here for this precataclysmic variable star .",
    "the wide  field image of hfg1 nebula shown in fig .",
    "1 , was obtained with the 0.3 m schmidt  cassegrain telescope at skinakas observatory , crete , greece on august 2 , 2008 .",
    "the observations were performed with a 1024 @xmath4 1024 thomson ccd which provides a 70  @xmath4 70  field of view and an image scale of 4  per pixel .",
    "the hfg1 nebula was observed for 900 s through the h@xmath0  plus [ n  ii ]  6548  &  6584    filter and for 180 s with the corresponding continuum filter .",
    "standard iraf and starlink routines were employed for the data reduction .",
    "all frames were bias subtracted and flat ",
    "field corrected using a series of well exposed twighlight flat  fields .",
    "the continuum image was scaled to the same intensity as the emission line image by comparing the total star signal ( above sky ) for a number of unsaturated stars in both images and multiplying the continuum image by the appropriate factor .",
    "the two images were then aligned by deriving an astrometric solution using the hst guide star catalogue @xcite . finally the scaled and aligned continuum image was subtracted from the emission line image to eliminate the confusing star field and reveal the extent of the nebulosity .",
    "note that the equatorial coordinates quoted in this work refer to epoch 2000 .",
    "the image shown in fig .",
    "1 reveals extended emission from around the star ( diameter @xmath5 10 ) , with the brightest , arc - like , sharpest edge to the south  east and with a faint tail extending to the north  west , about 5  wide and extending at least 20 .",
    "the sharp se rim is likely to be a bowshock and the long tail , that is aligned with this feature , is likely to be the remnant trail behind the pn / star as it moves through the ism .    the first test of the suggestion that the extended emission feature shown in fig .",
    "1 and directed along pa = 316  ( north through east ) from hfg1 is caused by the passage of the pn through its local ism is to determine the proper motion ( pm ) direction of the progenitor star v664  cas , corrected for any relative motion due to differential galactic rotation .",
    "@xcite measure the pms as d(@xmath0,@xmath6)/dt@xmath7(7.6,-7.8 ) mas yr@xmath8 where @xmath9 & @xmath10 are the right ascension and declination directions respectively .",
    "these values are accurate to @xmath3 0.6 mas yr@xmath8 . using oort s constants a@xmath714 and b @xmath1112",
    "kpc@xmath8 the correction for differential galactic rotation is @xmath122.3 mas yr@xmath8 along galactic longitude , at constant latitude . the pm values then become 9.6 @xmath3 0.6 , -8.9 @xmath3 0.6 mas yr@xmath8 .",
    "this correction is independent of distance to v664  cas .",
    "galactic longitude at constant latitude increases along pa@xmath7120  for v664  cas .",
    "a pm@xmath713 @xmath3 1.5 mas yr@xmath8 along pa@xmath7133 @xmath3 6  due to the motion of v664  cas through its local ism is indicated .",
    "this apparent motion , within the uncertainties , is directly opposite to the direction of the proposed trail seen in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .    for",
    "the range of possible distances to v664 cas of d@xmath7310 to 950 pc as given by @xcite the tangential velocity ( in the plane of the sky ) is then between 19 @xmath3 2 and 58 @xmath3 6  for this corrected pm@xmath713 @xmath3 1.5 mas yr@xmath8 .",
    "the correction for differential galactic rotation for v664  cas to its radial velocity for the same distance range then amounts to -4 to -13 . as the measured local standard of rest radial velocity of v664",
    "cas is -26 @xmath3 2  then the radial velocity of hfg1 with respect to its local ism is between -22 @xmath3 2 to -13 @xmath3 1.3  for this same range of possible distances .",
    "similarly , the range of space velocities again with respect to its local ism is therefore v@xmath13 29 @xmath3 4 to 59 @xmath3 9 tilted towards the observer by between @xmath14 49 @xmath3 5  to 13 @xmath3 3  respectively .",
    "the higher v@xmath15 , and hence the further distance , would be favoured if the trail found here has been caused by shock ionization as the mass ejecting stellar system v664  cas ploughs through its local ism . if this is the case , the measured pms and the trail angular length of @xmath16  20  in fig .  [ fig01 ]",
    "indicate that this process has occurred over a kinematic age of @xmath17  10@xmath2 y i.e. simply the angular length of the trail divided by the stellar pm .",
    "this is far too long for the trail to be ionized by leakage of lyman photons during the pn phase of the primary 0.57 solar mass @xcite star of the binary system . in any case",
    "there is tentative evidence in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] that a bow  shock in the pa = 133  direction precedes the motion which then favours the shock ionization explanation ( seen also in the [ o  iii ]  5007  image of @xcite , in figs . 1 & 2 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the trail is material ejected in one direction , along the orbital axis of the central binary system which is oriented along pa@xmath7177  @xmath3  5  @xcite .",
    "however , the trail reported here in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] is substantially tilted ( a pa difference of 41 ) with respect to this direction which precludes any mono ",
    "polar ejection mechanism for its creation .",
    "detailed kinematical observations of both the tail and the pn itself are now required to investigate the relationships between the tail , the main part of the pn and the central binary system .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for constructive comments that have improved the paper considerably .",
    "skinakas observatory is a collaborative project of the university of crete , the foundation for research and technology - hellas , and the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik .",
