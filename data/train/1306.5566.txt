    "although @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory is not realized in nature it has received increasing attraction in the recent years . the main reason for this is the conjecture of a duality between @xmath0 sym and a certain class of string theories which is usually called the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite",
