    "when the infall of matter into a deep gravitational potential is mediated by an accretion disk , gravitational energy is converted to the thermal radiation which powers both low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "accretion disks present unique problems involving magnetized plasma dynamics , photoionization , atomic kinetics , thermal and ionization equilibria , general relativity , and radiation transfer .",
    "the accretion disks in lmxbs and agn are expected to have many common properties .",
    "the compactness of the accretor in lmxbs and agn and their inferred accretion rates imply temperatures of @xmath2  k and intense x - ray emission in the inner disk region .",
    "the inner radii of these disks , as well as the disk atmosphere as a whole , is substantially more ionized than the case in which the accretor is a white dwarf . in both lmxbs and agn ,",
    "the vast energy emitted in the inner disk region is reprocessed in the outer disk , where the external radiative heating can dominate the local thermal emission .",
    "the subsequent photoionization of the disk plasma radically alters its equilibrium state , structure , and spectrum , especially in the atmospheric and coronal disk layers , which are the subject of this study .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectroscopy is an essential tool to study the physics of this `` hot class '' of accretion disks and the conditions near black hole event horizons . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the outer radii of disks in neutron star lmxbs , since current observational constraints provide more stringent tests for lmxbs than for agn .",
    "the following points support these assertions :    * high resolution spectra can reveal discrete emission or absorption from atomic transitions within the accretion disk plasma , providing information on the accretion disk structure , dynamics , and physics .",
    "these spectra open a window into photoionized gases and their phase equilibria . * x - rays , and in particular discrete atomic transitions of hydrogen- and helium - like ions , probe the regions in the disk with the highest levels of ionization .",
    "regions closer to the compact object will have the highest ionization levels , although vertical stratification is also expected . *",
    "the knowledge of the accretion disk physics directly impacts our ability to probe the physical conditions around the compact object .",
    "for example , the fe k emission originating in the innermost regions of an accretion disk has been proposed as a direct probe of the general relativistic effects near a black hole event horizon in agn , by virtue of the observed characteristic line shape @xcite . however , very little is known about the physical conditions in the fe k emission region , and it is still unclear how our ignorance of the physical processes within the accretion disk affect the modeled fe k line profile and flux .",
    "it is also unclear whether the soft x - ray line features reported by @xcite are feasible . *",
    "while in neutron star lmxbs the photoionizing source must be near the neutron star surface , in agn and galactic black hole candidates ( bhc ) the location of the ionizing source is unknown . in agn , various authors have assumed the ionizing source to be located in the rotation axis of the black hole , above the disk midplane , possibly close to the base of a jet .",
    "alternatively , an ionizing source might be present on the upper layers of the disk , perhaps due to disk flares , or to comptonization of thermal uv photons in the accretion disk corona ( adc ) .",
    "* lmxb systems are observed in less crowded regions than agn . * in contrast to agn , lmxbs often have measured orbital parameters which constrain the geometry of the system , such as the maximum disk radius .",
    "lmxbs may also have a measured value of the disk inclination , while orbital phase and eclipse phase variations provide tomographic information .",
    "for example , measurements of the optical light curve amplitudes of lmxbs have yielded estimates of the angle subtended by the disk of @xmath3 12@xmath4 @xcite . * to our knowledge , the inner disk radii can only be studied in the x - ray band .",
    "theoretically , the thermal emission of the inner disk radii must peak in the x - ray band for both lmxbs and agn .",
    "the optical and uv emission originates in the outer regions of the accretion disk and further away from the compact object , and the radio and gamma ray emission is likely dominated by emission from jets .",
    "fewer physical ingredients are needed to model the outer radii of disks than the inner radii , so the logical progression is to successfully model the outer radii first .",
    "the x - ray spectroscopy of neutron star lmxbs will allow us to construct a physical picture of their accretion disks , which we can then use to investigate the inner disk in bhc and agn .    to fully exploit the high energy - resolution x - ray spectra of accretion disks , we created physical disk models and calculated synthetic spectra .",
    "the disk plasma , at @xmath5 to @xmath6  k , cools through atomic line emission that can be detected with space - borne x - ray observatories such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. modeling the equilibrium state of the plasma and the radiation transfer within the disk allows a calculation of the disk structure and its x - ray spectrum .",
    "a synthetic spectrum can be compared to the data .",
    "the model spectrum is unique in that it is calculated purely on physical , and not just phenomenological , grounds .",
    "we describe four fiducial disk models .",
    "two of these models were introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use a newly developed adaptive - mesh disk structure calculation , the @xcite photoionized plasma code , and a new x - ray emission code which uses @xmath7 data ( hebrew university / lawrence livermore atomic code , @xcite ) .",
    "the models consist of a disk illuminated by a pure neutron star continuum , and they contain as boundary conditions a compton - temperature adc at the top of the disk and a modified ( * ? ? ? * hereafter abbreviated as ss73 ) disk at the bottom @xcite .",
    "thus , the region of interest has a temperature and ionization which is intermediate of these two regions , and it emits copious x - ray radiation .    in section [ sub : line - lmxb ] , we introduce the x - ray line observations prior to _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ; in section [ sub : raddisk ] , we introduce theoretical work on the structure of x - ray illuminated accretion disks ; in section [ sec : modelatm ] , we describe the disk structure calculations and the assumptions of hydrostatic , thermal and ionization equilibrium ; in section [ sec : instab ] , we detail the effects of a thermal instability on a layer of the disk atmosphere throughout the disk ; in section [ sec : adamodel ] , we discuss the calculation of the high resolution spectrum , which is done _ a posteriori _ from the structure calculation ; in section [ sec : diskstruct ] , the disk density , temperature and ionization structure are presented ; in section [ sec : spec ] , the model spectra are shown , assuming a full , partial or obstructed view of the neutron star region , and we show simulated spectra utilizing the response of the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) and the _ chandra _ medium energy gratings ( meg ) ; in section [ sec : disc ] , comparisons of the model to the observed x - ray spectra of lmxbs are discussed briefly , and we discuss the limitations of the model . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , concluding remarks are presented .",
    "with the exception of fe k emission in the 6.47.0  kev range @xcite , discerning x - ray line emission in lmxbs has been challenging , owing to limitations in sensitivity and spectral resolving power , as well as the difficulties associated with attempts to extract line emission from data dominated by intense continuum emission .",
    "measurements obtained with the _",
    "einstein objective grating spectrometer @xcite , the _ rosat position sensitive proportional counter @xcite , and the _ asca ccd imaging detectors @xcite have shown that the spectra of a large fraction of bright lmxbs exhibit line emission .",
    "x - ray lines at @xmath8  kev are often mixed with various species , so that only the brightest lmxbs had clear line identifications , as in the case of ly@xmath0 in 4u1626 - 67 @xcite , fe l in sco x-1 , or ly@xmath0 & ly@xmath9 in 4u1636 - 53 @xcite . _ _ _    the x - ray line emission arises presumably as the result of irradiation of the disk by the x - ray continuum , producing an extended source of reprocessed emission .",
    "evidence of x - ray emission from extended regions in lmxbs comes from the spectral variations during ingress and egress phases of eclipses , and during rapid intensity fluctuations known as dips .",
    "most dips , which are observed to precede eclipses , are thought to result from variable obscuration and attenuation of the primary continuum by material near the outer disk edge , which has been thickened due to impact of the accretion stream with the disk @xcite .",
    "dips that are uncorrelated with orbital phase can be produced by orbiting clouds crossing the line of sight , as shown in figure [ fig : schem_lmxb ] .",
    "a cloud larger than @xmath10  cm can obscure the x - rays from the neutron star .",
    "hard x - ray emission , presumably originating in the adc , and representing a few percent of the non - eclipse flux , remains visible during mid - eclipse in several lmxbs , implying that the adc is larger than the secondary star @xcite .",
    "lmxb spectra during eclipses or dips may _ harden _ or _ soften _ , i.e. the proportion between hard ( @xmath1110  kev ) and soft ( @xmath83  kev ) x - rays changes .",
    "most sources harden during dips @xcite , consistent with photoelectric absorption , but there are exceptions like the softening of 4u1624 - 49 @xcite , and an unchanging x1755 - 33 @xcite .",
    "sources such as exo0748 - 67 , x1916 - 05 , and x1254 - 69 show evidence for an unabsorbed spectral component during dips @xcite , revealing an extended source of x - rays which is larger than the adc .",
    "these soft x - rays are likely radiation reprocessed in the accretion disk .",
    "dip ingress / egress times indicate adc sizes in the @xmath12 to @xmath13  cm range , a factor of a few smaller than the accretion disk sizes calculated from typical orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "a soft x - ray emission component distinct from the hard x - ray continuum has also been interpreted as being due to the effects of absorption edges or line emission in some lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the unequivocal identification of the accretion disk x - ray emission , requires both an energy resolution that is higher than ccd detectors , and high throughput , plus a quantitative theoretical prediction of the x - ray emission from the disk .",
    "we discuss the recently observed high resolution spectra in section [ sub : gspectra ] .        in lmxbs roughly half of the gravitational potential energy",
    "is released in the vicinity of the compact object ( i.e. , in a boundary layer near the neutron star surface ) .",
    "the disk is exposed to this radiation , and it will be heated by it .",
    "radiative heating can exceed internal viscous heating in the outer region of the disk .",
    "the temperature structure of the disk can thus be controlled by the x - ray field photoionizing the gas , suppressing convection , and increasing the scale height of the disk .",
    "assuming that all the viscous heating and radiative heating from illumination by the central source is radiated locally as a blackbody ( as in the ss73 model ) , @xcite calculated the temperature for a geometrically thin disk , with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius of the compact x - ray source : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the photospheric temperature , @xmath18 is the mass of the compact x - ray source , @xmath19 is the gravitational constant , @xmath20 the stephan - boltzmann constant , @xmath21 is the grazing angle of the incident x - ray flux with respect to the disk surface , and @xmath22 is the x - ray _ albedo _ such that @xmath23 is the fraction of x - rays absorbed at the photosphere .",
    "the albedo has been derived from optical observations @xcite .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : locdisk ] ) is the energy dissipated within the ss73 disk , and the second term is the radiative heating . the radiative heating term will dominate where @xmath24 where the x - ray luminosity is written in terms of an x - ray _ accretion efficiency _ @xmath25 , according to @xmath26 . for example ,",
    "accretion onto a neutron star results in roughly 1/2 of the gravitational potential energy being converted into x - rays , or @xmath27 .",
    "the disk , therefore , is radially divided in two regions : an inner region dominated by internal dissipation , and an outer region dominated by external illumination .",
    "external radiation will dominate the disk atmosphere energetics for the outer two or three decades in radii , and the local dissipation and magnetic flare heating , if any , will be ignored there ( see also section [ sub : bfield ] ) .",
    "the radial dependence of the disk temperature in equation ( [ eq : locdisk ] ) relies on averaging physical quantities such as the dissipation parameter @xmath0 in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane , which is valid for regions in the disk that are optically thick .",
    "however , as we will show in this article , the radiative recombination spectrum is very sensitive to the radial _ and _ the vertical ionization structure , including regions with an optical depth @xmath28 .    to obtain a high resolution spectrum of an accretion disk , and in particular one for which the outer ( or upper ) layers are x - ray photoionized ,",
    "several authors have calculated the vertical structure by solving the radiation transfer equations , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "models have been applied to agn and lmxbs in the high-@xmath29 state , since in the low - state radiatively inefficient accretion ensues , which is described by a separate family of models ( @xcite and references therein ) . in radiatively efficient accretion disks ,",
    "the radiative transfer is typically simplified by using an on - the spot approximation and the escape probability formalism . due to photoelectric absorption and compton scattering ,",
    "the ionization structure of the disk is stratified , and it is approximated by a set of zones , each with a single ionization parameter .",
    "the ionization structure of the disk can be solved by using photoionization codes such as cloudy @xcite and xstar @xcite , which calculate the ionization and thermal equilibrium state of the gas at each zone .",
    "@xcite calculated the vertical structure of an illuminated accretion disk and obtained the recombination x - ray spectrum for individual rings on the disk .",
    "@xcite utilized the temperatures in equation ( [ eq : locdisk ] ) and calculated the vertical structure and the uv spectrum from the entire disk .",
    "both assumed parameters for lmxbs , and gas pressure - dominated disks .",
    "later models of photoionized accretion disks focused primarily on calculating the fe k@xmath0 fluorescence emission from agn disks .",
    "@xcite and @xcite modeled semi - analytically the stratified , photoionized transition region between the corona and the disk in agn .",
    "they found that their approximations , which included on - the - spot absorption , matched more accurate radiation transfer codes for optical depths @xmath30 .",
    "they also discussed the existence of a two - phase medium , stopping short , however , of calculating an x - ray spectrum .",
    "@xcite modeled a radiation - pressure dominated disk and showed that the vertical structure of the disk implied significant differences in the fe k fluorescence line spectrum compared to that predicted by constant - density disk models @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite also found that the gas was thermally unstable at certain ionization parameters , which created an ambiguity in choosing solutions and a sharp transition in temperature in the disk .",
    "this instability is discussed in section [ sec : instab ] .",
    "@xcite calculated the vertical structure of disk ring as a function of radius , accretion rate , the angle of incidence of radiation , the photon index , and the black hole mass , albeit using a diffusion approximation .",
    "@xcite calculated the hydrostatic disk structure including compton scattering and line transfer without assuming the escape probability approximation .",
    "@xcite also calculated the structure of the optically thick part of the disk , by use of the diffusion approximation and the local @xmath0-prescription ( eq . [ [ eq : viscosity ] ] ) .",
    "all of the above models calculate the disk structure for one radius at a time .",
    "@xcite found the static solution that resolves the thermal instability in the gas by considering the effect of conduction , and they computed the x - ray recombination and resonance line scattering spectrum for the conduction transition region that forms between stable solutions in the disk . with this procedure , the unphysical ,",
    "sharp transition between stable phases was eliminated .",
    "li et al . considered ionizing continua typical of agn , which can yield stable solutions with three different temperatures for a given pressure ionization parameter @xmath31 ( defined in section [ sec : ionpar ] ) .",
    "up to three distinct transition layers can form .",
    "the reflection and recombination spectrum of the transition regions in the 0.51.5  kev range was computed by considering the vertical structure of an isobaric , optically thin region .",
    "they found that resonant scattering can be important within the transition region , depending on the local gravity and luminosity , which yields a line spectrum which is different from that of pure recombination emission .",
    "the vertical structure of an optically thick accretion disk can be obtained using the diffusion approximation , which assumes that the photon mean free path @xmath32 is much smaller than the scale of temperature and density gradients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "adding convective heat transfer by introducing an adiabatic temperature gradient , @xcite have calculated the vertical structure of an isolated accretion disk which is dominated by convection zones .",
    "such techniques are used in the standard stellar structure equations .",
    "x - ray illumination from the central compact object suppresses convection , reduces the thermal gradients in the disk , and has a stabilization effect in the outer radii ; but if x - ray illumination is combined with the diffusion approximation , it also produces a convex disk that self - shadows the outer disk regions .",
    "this contradicts the observed spectra , which show evidence of reprocessing from the outer disk @xcite .",
    "a semi - analytical model using a variable @xmath0-viscosity prescription was used to model agn disks and to investigate its effects on the lyman edge absorption and emission @xcite .",
    "the failure of the diffusion - equation models to reproduce a concave disk that can efficiently reprocess the central x - rays may indicate that important effects were neglected . first , the effect of the disk atmosphere and corona was ignored .",
    "second , turbulent heat transfer may produce a vertical disk structure that is nearly isothermal .",
    "the strong turbulence occurring at the scale of the disk thickness in magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) models supports this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "a reliable calculation of the turbulent heat transfer in an accretion disk is needed .",
    "therefore , we prefer to use the @xcite vertically - isothermal disk for the optically thick region .",
    "the diffusion approximation is inadequate when calculating high resolution spectra since line radiation must originate in a region where the photon mean - free - path @xmath32 exceeds the scale of the temperature gradient , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "thus , just as for stellar atmospheres @xcite , an explicit radiation transfer calculation without assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is needed .",
    "the modeling of photoionization heating , recombination cooling , and x - ray opacities is then required in the atmosphere .",
    "we consider a lmxb with a @xmath36 @xmath37 primary radiating an eddington luminosity ( @xmath38  erg  s@xmath39 ) bremsstrahlung continuum , with @xmath40  kev .",
    "a set of fiducial system parameters for a bright lmxb is used , so application to a particular source will require using the observed x - ray continuum to improve accuracy .",
    "the maximum radius of the centrally - illuminated disk is @xmath41  cm , so the orbital period @xmath8 day .",
    "the minimum radius is @xmath42  cm , below which the omitted effect of radiation pressure , in large part , determines the disk structure .    the vertical structure of the disk atmosphere for each annulus in the array ,",
    "is obtained by integrating the hydrostatic balance and 1-d radiation transfer equations for a slab geometry ( fig .",

    "the grid is coarse , and yet sufficiently broad to accomodate a hard x - ray tail in future models .",
    "the reprocessed radiation propagating upwards , @xmath61 , is omitted to accelerate the computation .",
    "this is a good approximation since the radiative heating is dominated by the direct flux @xmath50 .",
    "the reprocessed flux @xmath61 is calculated _ a posteriori _ by a high resolution spectral model ( section [ sec : adamodel ] ) .",
    "the difference between cooling and heating , @xmath62 , includes compton scattering , bremsstrahlung cooling , photoionization heating , collisional line cooling , and recombination line cooling ( section [ sec : thermal ] ) .",
    "cosmic abundances @xcite are assumed .",
    "the code from @xcite computes the net heating and ionization equilibrium , models compton scattering in one dimension , and calculates line scattering using escape probabilities .",
    "a new disk structure calculation simultaneously integrates equations ( [ eq : hydro])([eq : rad2 ] ) by the runge - kutta method , using an adaptive step - size control routine with error estimation , and equation ( [ eq : thermal ] ) is solved by a globally convergent newton s method @xcite . at the adc height @xmath63 , the equilibrium @xmath64 is close to the compton temperature @xmath65 , from which we begin to integrate downward until @xmath66 .",

    "if it does not match to better than @xmath31 % , the integration is repeated with a new estimate of the coronal density .",
    "while it is not clear that photoionization will cease to be important for temperatures less than @xmath17 , such zones emit negligible x - ray fluxes if @xmath83  cm .",
    "our new structure calculation also includes the effects of physical instabilities ( section [ sec : instab ] ) , and it removes the numerical instabilities obtained by @xcite .",
    "a novel and important feature of this model is that the incident radiation is allowed to modify the disk atmosphere geometry , such that the heating and expansion of the atmosphere resulting from illumination are used to calculate the height profile of the atmosphere as a function of radius .",
    "this feedback between the radiative heating and the atmospheric structure is depicted in figure [ fig : feed ] .",
    "the atmospheric height is used to derive the input grazing angle of the radiation for the next model iteration .",
    "this contrasts with calculating the grazing angle using the pressure scale height of the optically thick disk @xcite , which is in general much smaller than the photoionized atmosphere , and which underestimates the grazing angle and the line intensities by an order of magnitude . to get @xmath17 self - consistently from equation ( [ eq : locdisk ] ) ,",
    "the equation @xmath84 is needed , where @xmath85 is defined as the height where the frequency - integrated grazing flux @xmath86 is attenuated by @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are defined in figure [ fig : disk_model ] .",
    "the @xmath89 term is neglected , which is valid for @xmath90  cm .",
    "as discussed above , @xmath91 is calculated iteratively from equation ( [ eq : diskangle ] ) .",
    "after an initial guess for @xmath85 , it is re - calculated from the newly obtained disk structure . a power - law fit to @xmath85 works well to obtain @xmath91 .",
    "this iteration is performed with a limited number of radial bins ( 5 ) , to save computation time .",
    "the iteration is stopped after @xmath91 and @xmath17 converge to @xmath92 % .",
    "after convergence , the number of logarithmically spaced radial bins is increased to 26 .",
    "the process of convergence does not depend on the initial choice of @xmath91 , and it is shown in figure [ fig : conv ] . however , convergence does depend on the choice of @xmath93 , which is a free parameter in the model .",
    "since @xmath93 is not physically determined , it must be defined _ ad hoc _ , but it is bound by @xmath94 . for @xmath95 , the illumination @xmath96 , and the disk blackbody flux @xmath97 takes over . to test",
    "how sensitive is the result to the definition of @xmath93 , we calculate @xmath91 taking @xmath98 , and we use this to estimate the systematic errors of the 1-d radiation transfer calculation .",
    "the validity of the assumptions is reviewed , both for the the model presented here and for some of the accretion disk models in the astrophysical literature .    for modeling x - ray line emission from the disk atmosphere",
    ", the commonly used assumptions of @xmath99 and the diffusion approximation will not hold .",
    "in addition , assuming a constant density in the vertical direction will be inadequate , since the hydrostatic equilibration time is small or comparable to other relevant timescales , and the line emission is highly sensitive to the vertical ionization structure .",
    "the recombination emission is especially sensitive to this structure , since each ion emits clearly resolvable line energies .",
    "also , fluorescence emission can be reprocessed by a compton - thick , fully ionized gas above it @xcite .",
    "thermal equilibrium and ionization equilibrium are reasonable assumptions in a time averaged sense .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium is also assumed , to avoid explicit computation of the plasma dynamics with radiative transfer .",
    "deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium are smoothed in the timescale @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the sound speed .",
    "material from the disk moves radially within the viscous timescale @xmath102 @xcite , so the gas can reach hydrostatic equilibrium before it flows inward ( i.e , the radial accretion velocity is always subsonic ) .",
    "however , the keplerian orbital velocity @xmath103 is highly supersonic .",
    "if the gas flow in the corotating frame of the gas is also supersonic , then shocks would collisionally ionize and heat the gas .",
    "in such a case , the observed spectrum of the disk would significantly deviate from a photoionized gas in ionization and thermal equilibrium .",
    "the thermalization and ionization equilibrium timescale of the atmosphere is driven by the recombination timescale @xmath104 which can be derived from equation ( [ eq : recrate ] ) , and where @xmath105 is the temperature in units of @xmath5  k , @xmath106 is the density in units of @xmath107  @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the atomic number @xcite .",
    "the photoionization timescale is shorter than @xmath110 where the gas is fully stripped ; otherwise both timescales are comparable for the relevant ions having similar abundances .",
    "the coulomb collision relaxation timescale between electrons and ions @xmath111 is slower than between identical particles , and is @xcite @xmath112 electron - electron relaxation is @xmath113 times faster , and proton - proton relaxation is @xmath114 times faster .",
    "for the hot corona at the outer disk at @xmath115  k and @xmath116  @xmath108 ( from the coronal structure in section [ sec : diskstruct ] ) , the relaxation timescale is @xmath117  sec .",
    "the fully ionized gas in the corona , which is near the compton temperature , has a thermal timescale of @xmath118  sec , where @xmath119 is the disk radius in units of @xmath120  cm , and @xmath121 is the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath122  ergs@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "thus , thermalization in the disk atmosphere and corona is driven by the ionization timescales , since the coulomb relaxation times are comparatively fast due to the large density .",
    "thermal and ionization equilibrium occur faster than hydrostatic equilibrium , for length scales @xmath123  cm . if @xmath124 , luminosity fluctuations with timescales @xmath125 such that @xmath126 will take the gas outside hydrostatic equilibrium , but not out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "integrated spectral observations on timescales @xmath127 can not observe this effect .",
    "the radiation transfer is complex , and the assumptions used to simplify calculations could be problematic . in particular , by dividing the disk atmosphere into annular zones with a given vertical gas column , our 1-d radiation transfer calculation assumes that 1 ) the primary continuum is not absorbed before reaching the top of the column , 2 ) the radiation in the column propagates from top to bottom at a given grazing angle , and 3 ) there is no significant radiative coupling from one disk annulus to another , which is used to justify the slab approximation .",
    "the above assumptions are inadequate if the column height is comparable to the disk radius , or if the photon mean free path in the gas column is many times the local radius .",

    "the intense uv fields in lmxbs imply the same effect will operate @xcite . in the context of the present model , the region where he - like ions are abundant is very close ( less than @xmath6  cm away ) to the photospheric surface , such that the uv energy density is as high as in the photospheric surface .",
    "this implies that the he - like diagnostics will be degenerate to high density and uv field effects @xcite .",
    "the optical depth of the atmosphere may be probed by comparing the observed spectra to the model , which assumes the lines are optically thin .",
    "in particular , the @xmath54 line may differ from the modeled value due to resonant scattering of continuum photons . whether @xmath54 gets enhanced or absorbed depends on geometry and the relative placement of emissivity and opacity .",
    "the @xmath187 and @xmath256 lines should be optically thin , so optical depth can modify the @xmath261 ratio substantially from @xmath262 , the value expected for a photoionization - dominated , optically thin gas .",
    "the ly@xmath0 line in hydrogenic ions also has a large scattering cross section .",
    "thus , the he@xmath0 @xmath54 and/or ly@xmath0 lines are good indicators of optical depth .",
    "the rrc can be used for temperature diagnostics , and also for probing the behavior of the thermal instability . the local rrc width @xmath263 @xcite .",
    "the rrc broadening is doppler - dominated , resembling the rr lines , for both the evaporating and condensing cases .",
    "the rrc shape varies noticeably from the evaporating to the condensing condition . in the evaporating case ,",
    "the rrc has two temperature components , one with a @xmath264   that is produced at @xmath218  k , and another narrow component with @xmath265  k. the two components are distinguishable because intermediate temperatures are thermally unstable .",
    "thus , the rrc profile in this case provides evidence for the existence of this thermal instability . in the condensing case",
    ", the rrc has a single , broad temperature component at @xmath218  k , since the disk atmosphere temperature suddenly drops from the latter value to one where the x - ray emission is negligible .",
    "the broadening of this rrc is also peculiar , since rrc are usually narrow for all photoionized gases , given that the kinetic energy of the gas particles is generally much smaller than the recombining photon energy @xcite .",
    "the disk model was run with a lower central luminosity @xmath266 , for comparison to the @xmath267 case explored in the previous sections , to investigate the structural and spectral changes of the disk .",
    "the atmospheric radiative recombination luminosity was @xmath268 times lower than the @xmath269 case , indicating a nearly linear dependence of the disk luminosity to the central luminosity .",
    "otherwise , the low - luminosity spectrum shown in figure [ fig : lowlumspec ] shows much resemblance to its @xmath267 counterpart .",
    "the dependence of the recombination luminosity can be approximated by @xmath270 where @xmath129 is the solid angle subtended by the disk atmosphere .",
    "this relationship is then modified by the changing density , opacity and thickness of the atmosphere .",
    "to explain the recombination luminosity behavior , we will first describe the calculated atmosphere structure .",
    "the photospheric and atmospheric boundaries were fitted by power laws .",
    "the fit parameters defined in section [ sec : diskstruct ] were @xmath271 cm , @xmath272 , @xmath273  cm , and @xmath274 .",

    "this implies little variation of the disk shape with luminosity . with a factor of ten reduction in luminosity , the radiative energy incident on",
    "the disk is 20 times smaller , which coincides with the observed reduction in the recombination emission .    the accretion disk structure for @xmath277 , shown in figures [ fig : disk_temp ] , [ fig : disk_density ] , [ fig : atm_temp ] , and [ fig : atm_density ] , yields a density @xmath278 times smaller than the @xmath267 case . aside from the density change",
    ", the ionization structure remains quite similar to the @xmath267 case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : irondist][a ] and [ fig : irondist][b ] ) .",
    "naively , a factor of 10 decrease in the density would be expected to keep @xmath149 constant . however , since the atmospheric volume shows little change , the observed density change implies a factor of @xmath268 decrease in the ion emission measure , verifying the consistency of the density with the modeled recombination flux .",
    "we reconcile @xmath149 with the larger - than - expected density of the atmosphere by accounting for a decrease in the atmospheric opacity .",
    "considering @xmath149 to be constant , such that @xmath279 where @xmath280 , implies that a decrease in density decreases the opacity , which increases the local flux in the atmosphere .",
    "thus , the overdensity of the atmosphere is explained by a factor of @xmath281 decrease in @xmath282 , which was verified in the models . for the @xmath266 case",
    ", the atmosphere transmits 34 % of the incident flux directly for a disk annulus with @xmath283  cm , i.e. @xmath284 , compared to 12 % in the @xmath285 case ( see section [ sec : diskstruct ] ) .",
    "the atmospheric opacity is a function of radius , but the observed spectra are weighted towards the largest radii .",
    "the argument above holds for plane parallel atmospheres that are photoionized by radiation incident at a small grazing angle @xmath286 , such that @xmath287 for a grazing ray , but @xmath207 for any other ray .",
    "therefore , the recombination luminosity will be proportional to the total emission measure for most viewing angles .    as more of the x - ray continuum is transmitted onto the disk photosphere , the heating of the optically thick disk increases .",
    "this effect is taken into account to derive a self - consistent midplane disk temperature , to 10 % . the input grazing angle and the grazing angle calculated from @xmath93 are consistent at the 25 % level .",
    "there is a negligible change in the atmospheric structure by varying @xmath0 from 0.1 to 1 in the disk model . as explained below , this",
    "can be understood as a decoupling which exists between the optically thick disk and the photoionized atmosphere .",
    "the viscosity parameter @xmath0 has no effect on the disk temperature , but it does on the density , since @xmath288 ( ss73 ) . assuming vertical isothermality in the optically thick disk ( below the photosphere ) , its pressure can be obtained from equation ( [ eq : hydro ] ) and is given by : @xmath289 with @xmath290 .",
    "the photoionized atmosphere is placed on top of this disk , and satisfies two boundary conditions : matching temperature and pressure at the photospheric boundary .",
    "assume the base of the atmosphere is at some pressure @xmath291 , and let a change in viscosity from @xmath0 to @xmath292 produce a change in the subphotospheric disk pressure from @xmath293 to @xmath294 . to match the boundary conditions , the atmosphere has to shift in height , such that @xmath295 which implies that the height shift in the atmosphere , @xmath296 , is given by : @xmath297 where the approximation @xmath298 was used , which is valid since @xmath299 in the models for @xmath300 .",
    "in such a case , it follows that @xmath301 , so that very large changes in viscosity only produce minute shifts on the atmospheric height and negligible effects on the atmospheric emission ( as already pointed out by @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , other situations where the role of dissipation in the atmosphere has to be reassessed : 1 ) if the dissipated energy in the disk is no longer negligible compared to the exterior illumination energy , as might be the case for disks around black hole candidates , and if energy is transported to the atmosphere via magnetic flares , for example , and 2 ) if there is negligible dissipation , but it is sufficient to enhance mixing and , therefore , change the atmospheric structure .",
    "@xcite noted that the structure of the optically - thick disk has non - negligible effects in the corona when the disk scale height is comparable to or larger than the coronal scale height ( in our notation , when @xmath302 ) .",
    "this does not apply to our case , because for a neutron star lmxb disk with @xmath303  cm , we get @xmath304 .",
    "@xcite assert that the disk and corona are coupled in bhc for @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the schwarzschild radius ; while for agn , the situation depends on the accretion rate . by this measure",
    ", the disk - corona coupling may also be significant in the outer radii of bhc disks , if the reduction of the central illumination flux shrinks the size of the corona .",
    "synthetic profiles were produced for all the emission lines . for simplicity",
    ", the calculation assumes that line scattering is negligible , which may not be a valid assumption for resonance lines .",
    "here we select the profiles of the brightest lines that are not contaminated by other ions .",
    "the line profiles are also calculated for a disk within the @xmath307  cm radius range , for comparison with the @xmath308  cm radius range shown above .",

    "no variation in line broadening is obtained as a function of charge state .",
    "the ly@xmath0 line has the same velocity profile as the corresponding lines in , , , and .",

    "our models are proving to be of great relevance to the interpretation of the spectra of lmxbs with high inclination and lmxbs with an x - ray pulsar .",
    "most importantly , all lmxb spectra validate the basic assumption in our model : the plasma is photoionized .",
    "evidence for other heating mechanisms , such as shocks , is not observed in lmxb spectra .",
    "shocks are predicted by the @xcite mhd disk models , but it is not clear whether x - ray emission from such shocks would be observable .",

    "these properties are shared by all the spectra shown in this article .",
    "furthermore , the line velocity broadening observed in two lmxbs ( 4u1626 - 67 and exo0748 - 67 ) provides kinematic evidence for accretion disk atmospheric and coronal emission .",

    "initially , our model can be used as a tool for the identification of the discrete x - ray spectral signatures from the accretion disk atmosphere and corona .",
    "our model provides a quantitative expectation of the x - ray line fluxes produced by the entire disk .",
    "our physical calculation of the line profiles ( and therefore the line emissivity as a function of @xmath54 ) , can be used to measure the maximum disk radius and the radial ionization distribution .",
    "furthermore , we have modeled the density at which each ion is produced , and this is testable with plasma diagnostics .",
    "the ionization distribution ( measured by the flux of the emission from the high - ionization species relative to that of the low - ionization species ) is a fingerprint of the disk atmosphere and corona .",

    "the observed spectra will also allow us to investigate additional physics in the disk which may be missing in our current model .",
    "a 2-d or 3-d transfer calculation is needed to improve the coronal structure model . to simplify the radiation transfer calculations , we split the disk into a set of nested cylindrical shells , and we use 1-d transfer to calculate the structure of each shell . by defining @xmath85 and iterating on @xmath91 in each shell until self - consistency is obtained ( see eq .

    "the structure model indicates that the optical depth of resonance lines is large .",
    "however , a realistic treatment of resonant scattering in our spectral models is complicated by the velocity shear within the disk .",
    "resonant scattering and fe k fluorescence emission were only included in the low - resolution 1-d transfer calculations to obtain the disk structure .",
    "the propagation of resonance line photons is highly anisotropic , and it depends on the viewing angle because of the keplerian velocity shear and the geometrical thickness of the atmosphere .",
    "lmxbs with strong emission lines do not exhibit detectable features from resonant scattering of continuum photons , with the exception of circinus x-1 ( section [ sub : gspectra ] ) .",

    "we believe @xmath315 fields play a secondary role in this type of corona , because the energy budget of the corona is dominated by x - ray irradiation . in detail , the role of @xmath315 fields can not be discounted , because phenomena such as magnetic flare heating may dominate over photoionization within localized regions of the disk .",
    "recent mhd models predict @xmath315 fields larger than the virial value in the disk corona .",
    "however , the applicability of these mhd models to the illuminated corona is dependent on the effects of radiative heating and magnetic reconnection .",
    "mhd models of _ radiationless _ accretion disks show that above a few scale heights , the magnetic pressure is larger than @xmath316 @xcite .",
    "the gas dynamics in the disc is dominated by the @xmath317 .",

    "a 3d mhd disk model by @xcite , with an initial toroidal configuration , shows that the strong @xmath315 fields in the corona are confined in filaments , with a filling factor of a few percent .",
    "another 3d mhd model by @xcite confirms the presence of large @xmath315 fields in the corona .",
    "by contrast , when x - ray illumination is present , the @xmath315 field plays a relatively minor role in the overall energetics of the disk corona .",
    "this is true at least in a spatially - averaged sense .",
    "the magnetic energy produced by the @xmath317 can be no larger than the energy dissipated in the disk .",
    "the maximum energy available for the @xmath315 field scales as @xmath319 , and it is given by the first term on the right side of equation ( [ eq : locdisk ] ) .",
    "assuming all of the accretion energy is contained in the @xmath315 field , equation ( [ eq : disk ] ) indicates that the illumination energy is larger than the magnetic energy for @xmath312  cm ( per unit disk area ) .",

    "magnetic reconnection has the effect of decreasing the magnitude of the disk - coronal @xmath315 field .",
    "coronal flares resulting from magnetic reconnection convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy through particle acceleration .",
    "most of the x - rays in black hole accretion disks may be produced by magnetic flares @xcite . in the @xcite model ,",
    "reconnection events in disk flares reduce the @xmath315 field by a factor of @xmath320 .",
    "thus , the buoyant @xmath315 field may be dissipated in a flaring region .",

    "we also determined the atmosphere s thermal stability and its observable high resolution x - ray recombination emission spectrum .    * _ a feedback mechanism between illumination and atmospheric structure enlarges the atmosphere_. the disk atmosphere is orders of magnitude less dense than the disk midplane .",
