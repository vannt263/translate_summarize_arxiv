    "neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath6 ) leads to the decay of a nucleus of charge @xmath7 and atomic number @xmath8 via the process @xmath9 .",

    "its observation would therefore be a direct indication for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "neutrinos would be majorana and not dirac particles , thereby solving one of the fundamental questions of particle physics . the @xmath6 half - life",

    "beta decay is therefore forbidden or strongly suppressed for even - even nuclei , making them the only candidates for observing @xmath6 decays .",
    "the nemo  3 experiment has been taking data since 2003 in the modane underground laboratory ( lsm ) located in the frejus tunnel at a depth of 4800  m water equivalent . the experiment has a cylindrical shape with 20 sectors that contain different isotopes in the form of thin foils with a total surface of about 20  m@xmath19 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
