    "multiply deuterated molecules have drawn much attention in the past few years , with the detections of d@xmath0co @xcite , nd@xmath0h @xcite and even nd@xmath2 @xcite . d@xmath0co was found to be particularly abundant ( with [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co]@xmath3% ) in low - mass protostellar environments @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms leading to such high degrees of deuteration remain however debated . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "high deuterium fractionation can be obtained via active grain chemistry : the deuteration of the molecules , stuck onto the grains , is regulated by the _",
    "d / h ratio of the gas accreting into the mantles .",
    "the other major way to forming deuterated molecules is through pure gas - phase reactions in presence of strong co ( and other molecules ) depletion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rma ) . in this case , the deuterium is propagated to other molecules mostly by reactions with h@xmath0d@xmath4 , and the [ h@xmath0d@xmath4]/[h@xmath6 ratio , which is also proportional to the atomic d / h ratio , plays a crucial role in determining the molecular deuterium ratio . in both approaches ,",
    "a low temperature ( @xmath7k ) is necessary to obtain enhanced d / h or [ h@xmath0d@xmath4]/[h@xmath6 ratios and therefore enhanced levels of molecular deuteration .",
    "the gas - grain interaction mechanism was favoured to interpret the observations towards iras16293 - 2422 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in this scheme , d atoms react with the co molecules on the grain surface _ during the colder , pre - collapse stage _ , and the obtained molecules are later released into the gas phase through heating from the newly - formed protostars .",
    "pure gas phase models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rmb ) could however well account for the observed [ nd@xmath0h]/[nh@xmath2 ] ratios found by @xcite .",
    "recently , d@xmath0co was detected in l1689n , the cloud which iras16293 is embedded in , with an abundance ratio similar to that found at the border of the envelope of the protostar @xcite .",
    "this detection posed new problems , since none of the aforementioned models can account for the abundance of d@xmath0co in that cloud . in order to have a high atomic d / h ratio ,",
    "both models require strong co and o depletion , which is not consistent with the high atomic o abundance observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , a former colder , denser ( and possibly more depleted ) phase can not be invoked for l1689n .",
    "pre - stellar cores , as ( starless ) progenitors of low - mass protostars , offer the opportunity to study the cold , dense evolutionary stage in which the deuteration of molecules supposedly occurred .",
    "in addition , these objects are known to show strong degrees of co ( among other molecules ) depletion , which is a necessary requisite for the models : the amount of deuteration should be linked to the degree of co depletion .",
    "we recently studied the degree of co depletion in a sample of pre - stellar cores , and showed that the depletion degree increases with density @xcite . in this letter , we report the successful search for d@xmath0co in those pre - stellar cores and test quantitatively the hypothesis that stronger co depletions lead to larger [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios .",
    "we first briefly describe our multi - transition h@xmath0co and d@xmath0co observations in section[observ ] and present our results on the h@xmath0co abundance and d@xmath0co over h@xmath0co abundance ratio in section[results ] .",
    "we then discuss our results and their implications on deuteration mechanisms and finally conclude in section[concl ] .",
    "we observed in august 2001 a sample of cores for which we had already discussed the co depletion @xcite in various transitions of h@xmath0co and d@xmath0co ( cf .",
    "jpl catalog ) at the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta in spain .",
    "the spectra were taken in the position switching mode at the core central position ( maximum of the continuum emission ) .",
    "additional observations ( small maps around the peak ) to check the extent of the emission of h@xmath0co(2@xmath9 - 1@xmath10 ) and h@xmath0co(3@xmath11 - 2@xmath9 ) were carried out in november 2001 .",
    "the _ rms _ reached were between 20 and 80mk on the h@xmath0co transitions and between 15 and 50mk on the lower energy d@xmath0co transitions d@xmath0co(2@xmath9 - 1@xmath10 ) and d@xmath0co(3@xmath11 - 2@xmath9 ) . in order to estimate the opacities of the h@xmath0co transitions",
    ", we observed in august 2002 the ( 2@xmath9 - 1@xmath10 ) transition of h@xmath12co in all cores but l1544 .",
    "in all these observing runs , we used as backend an autocorrelator with spectral resolution of 40khz at @xmath13ghz , and 80khz at @xmath14ghz , yielding resolutions of @xmath15kms@xmath16 depending on line frequency .",
    "the beam and forward efficiencies at the different line frequencies can be found on the iram web page at http://www.iram.es .",
    "pointing was checked every 1.5 hours and found to be better than @xmath173 . in the following",
    ", line fluxes are given in units of main beam brightness temperature .",
    "in addition to the _ rms _ noise , a calibration uncertainty of 15% at 150ghz and of 20% at 230 ghz was taken into account .",
    "in 5 out of the 7 cores in our sample , d@xmath0co was clearly detected in at least one transition ( table[obs])co(@xmath18 ) in l328 is questionable , since a 3@xmath19 line was seen at the right velocity after 20 minutes of integration on both 3 mm receivers .",
    "further integration did not confirm this detection . ] .",
    "the transition d@xmath0co@xmath20 is a @xmath21 detection in those 5 cores ( fig[lines ] ) .",
    "the line fluxes given in this table were determined by integrating the line signal between two given velocities ( typically , where the signal is larger than the noise ) . for non - detections ,",
    "the upper limit was taken as 3 times the _ rms _ on the velocity - integrated intensity , given a linewidth close to that of detected lines of the same molecule .    to derive the d@xmath0co and h@xmath0co column densities and abundances , we used rotational diagrams ( see @xcite for a full description of the method ) .",
    "rotational diagrams give a correct estimate of the column density only when the lines are thermally populated and optically thin . if , however , the lines are sub - thermally excited , the rotational column density can be substantially different from the real one .",
    "for this reason , in this article we focus only on the relative [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] ratio , as it is not affected by such uncertainty thanks to the similarity of the two molecules .",
    "line opacity can also affect the rotation temperature , but has little effect on the column density ratio .",
    "this method implies identical excitation conditions in both lines .",
    "we estimated separately the ortho - h@xmath0co and para - h@xmath0co column densities , and assumed an ortho - to - para ratio of 2 for d@xmath0co .",
    "a single rotational temperature was derived simultaneously for both the ortho- and the para- h@xmath0co and then used to determine the d@xmath0co column density . in the cases where more than one d@xmath0co transition was detected ,",
    "the rotational temperature was derived simultaneously for ortho - h@xmath0co , para - h@xmath0co and d@xmath0co as well . for l1544",
    ", the rotational temperature was assumed to be 7.25@xmath222.5k , which is an average of the values found for the other cores , and consistent with the gas temperature determined by bacmann et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . from the small maps we made around the central position ,",
    "the h@xmath0co(3@xmath11 - 2@xmath9 ) emission was found to be extended in the cores . to correct for the difference in beam filling factors at 145 and 220 ghz , the h@xmath0co(3@xmath11 - 2@xmath9 )",
    "was degraded to the spatial resolution of the h@xmath0co(2@xmath9 - 1@xmath10 ) line .",
    "the intensity ratio between the original and the degraded spectra ( close to one ) was applied to estimate the degraded h@xmath0co(3@xmath23 - 2@xmath24 ) spectra .",
    "note that both transitions are very close in frequencies and upper level energy .",
    "finally , we corrected for the line opacity effects estimated by our observations of the h@xmath12co ( 2@xmath9 - 1@xmath10 ) transition , which suggest opacities of 212 ( most of them around 35 ) .",
    "the final h@xmath0co column densities of table [ coldens ] have been obtained by taking a @xmath25 isotopomer abundance ratio of 60 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "incidently , the observed h@xmath0co line profiles are consistent ( except for oph d ) with infalling gas , the lines being self - absorbed and the blue - shifted peak brighter than the red - shifted one @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the observed kinematics as well as the absolute abundances and ortho - to - para ratios will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the minimum and maximum values of the column densities and the [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] abundance ratios were determined by using a monte - carlo method to explore the whole range of possible values for the rotational temperature and integrated line flux within the error bars .",
    "the column densities in h@xmath0co , d@xmath0co , h@xmath0 , the d@xmath0co abundances and the [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] abundance ratios are given in table[coldens ] .",
    "d@xmath0co is found extremely abundant in all cores where it was detected .",
    "the [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] abundance ratios given in table[coldens ] ( between @xmath261% and 10% ) are comparable to the values quoted by @xcite for low - luminosity protostars .",
    "the h@xmath0co ortho / para ratio was found around 2.5 - 3 ( except for l310 where it was @xmath27 ) , which is consistent with a gas - phase formation of h@xmath0co ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the high abundance of d@xmath0co in pre - stellar cores provides convincing evidence that the d@xmath0co seen in low - luminosity protostars originates in the cold , pre - stellar stage , as was suggested by @xcite and their subsequent works ( see introduction ) . in the gas - phase schemes , high deuterium fractionations of a few percent ( up to @xmath28 ) like those measured around young low - luminosity protostars @xcite",
    "can only be achieved when the gas phase is highly depleted of molecules and atoms reacting with h@xmath29 ( rma , rmb ) .",
    "it is also the case in gas - grain chemistry models , for which high deuterium fractionations are obtained when the atomic d / h is high , which is in turn favoured when the gas phase is depleted of co. in order to test this hypothesis , we plotted in fig.[d2co ] the [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] ratio against the co depletion degree estimated in @xcite - and their table 2 . as can be seen on the plot , the scatter and error bars are large ( especially for l1544 for which the data are not as complete ) , although cores with high depletion factors tend to have high deuteration fractions in formaldehyde . in this figure ,",
    "the error bars on the co depletion can be mostly attributed to the uncertainty on the dust extinction coefficient @xmath30 at 1.3 mm ( a factor of @xmath31 ) . despite the large scatter , the trend that we observe is consistent with an increase of deuteration with the co depletion . to give a quantitative estimate ,",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is 0.7 , indicating a large probability that the two quantities , [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] and co depletion , are indeed correlated .",
    "the models also state that the gas phase should be depleted of o , which is an important h@xmath29 destroyer as well , only a small factor 2.5 less efficient than co , according to the umist database ( http : www.rate99.co.uk/ ) .",
    "we have for the time being no _ direct _ information on the amount of atomic oxygen still in the gas phase in these cores , but some indirect indications that o is not much depleted indeed .",
    "on the one hand , large quantities of gaseous atomic oxygen have been observed in several cold , co depleted , molecular clouds @xcite . on the other hand , a detailed modeling of the l1544 core ( also in our sample ) molecular composition also suggests a large atomic oxygen abundance in the gas phase @xcite . the apparent correlation between [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] and co depletion and the very high fractionation observed may suggest either a similar degree of oxygen depletion with respect to co ( which would disagree with the aforementioned arguments ) or a lower role of o in the fractionation ( yet not supported by theoretical considerations ) . in the last case ,",
    "the relatively large scatter observed in fig .",
    "[ d2co ] may be due to the presence of o in the gas phase .",
    "the question remains whether d@xmath0co is formed in the gas phase @xcite and frozen out onto the grains or directly formed on the grains as suggested by @xcite .",
    "if d@xmath0co is formed on the grains , there must exist an efficient desorption mechanism to release part of the d@xmath0co into the gas phase , even in such cold ( @xmath32k ) environments as pre - stellar cores .",
    "the depletion timescale ( @xmath33yr - to be compared with estimated lifetimes of 10@xmath34yr , see @xcite ) derived in @xcite suggests that desorption mechanisms indeed exist , since it is highly unlikely that all cores from the sample have only reached 1% of their lifetime .",
    "the gas - grain model is thus not ruled out by observations of d@xmath0co in the gas phase , even in objects with @xmath32k .",
    "for the rest , the same remarks as on the cloud l1689n @xcite apply here . in the absence of o depletion ,",
    "the atomic d / h ratio is predicted to be around 0.01 ( rma ) , which is not sufficient to account for the high levels of deuteration observed here ( to account for a @xmath35/[h_2co]$ ] ratio of 0.05 , the atomic d / h ratio would have to be as high as 0.3 - @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.[d2co ] represents the predictions of the gas - phase rmb model , which assumes relatively large o depletion as well .",
    "our data compare rather well with those predictions , with the exception of oph d , which shows a larger [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] ( @xmath2610% ) than predicted .",
    "however , we point out that another key parameter in the roberts & millar model is the electron fractional abundance .",
    "the predictions reported in fig .",
    "[ d2co ] have been taken from the fig .",
    "3 of rmb , who assumed an electron fractional abundance around @xmath36 .",
    "this is much larger than the value of @xmath37 actually found by @xcite in l1544 .",
    "5 of rma suggests that larger [ d@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios could be reached if the ionisation fraction @xmath38 is lowered .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the absolute d@xmath0co abundances we measured for the degrees of co depletion found in the cores ( table[coldens ] ) are generally smaller than those calculated by rmb ( between 10@xmath39 for low depletion factors and 1.6@xmath40 for depletion factors of 16 ) , though in the end , we find deuterium fractionations similar or higher than those predicted by the model .",
    "this discrepancy is strongly marked ( one order of magnitude ) for the cores with little depletion ( l1689b , l1709a and l328 ) .",
    "to summarize , gas - phase models , though they can account for the relative deuterium fractionation in most of our objects , can not explain all of our data .",
    "key points that still need to be fully understood are the depletion of atomic oxygen and its role , as well as the ionization fraction in pre - stellar cores .",
