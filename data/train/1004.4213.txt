    "supersymmetry is one of the most promising ideas for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "supersymmetric theories that incorporate local supersymmetry ( or supergravity ) predict the existence of the gravitino , the spin-3/2 superpartner of the graviton . when supersymmetry is broken , the gravitino acquires a mass through the super - higgs mechanism , `` eating '' the spin-1/2 goldstino , the goldstone fermion associated with spontaneously - broken local supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other superpartners , the gravitino can have a mass @xmath2 that is not at the weak scale @xmath3 , and viable models exist for gravitino masses as low as the ev scale and as high as 100 tev . in this work ,",
    "we consider light gravitinos , with mass in the ev to mev range .",
    "such gravitinos are highly motivated in particle physics , as they emerge in models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , in which constraints on flavor violation are naturally satisfied  @xcite .",
    "light gravitinos also have cosmological motivations .",

    "when originally proposed in the 1980 s , uncertainties in @xmath6 and the total matter relic density allowed @xmath7 .",
    "this led to a simple and attractive gravitino  dark - matter scenario , consistent with standard big bang cosmology , in which the universe cooled from some high temperature , and kev gravitinos froze out and now form all of the dark matter .    in the intervening years ,",
    "however , a variety of astrophysical constraints have greatly complicated this picture .",

    "gravitinos produced by thermal freeze out are cold enough to be all of the dark matter .",
    "note that the original `` kev gravitino '' scenario , previously favored , is now the most disfavored , in the sense that it is excluded by both overclosure and small - scale - structure constraints .",
    "all of the possibilities are rather complicated , however , as in each case , some additional physics is required , either to provide the rest of the dark matter or to modify the history of the early universe to allow gravitinos to be all of the dark matter .    in this paper , we discuss how collider data may help clarify this picture .",
    "light gravitinos are primarily produced at colliders in the decays of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "it is a remarkable coincidence that modern particle detectors , with components placed between 1 cm to 10 m from the beamline , are beautifully suited to distinguish between the nlsp decay lengths predicted in scenarios 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "for example , the decay length of a bino nlsp decaying to a gravitino is  @xcite @xmath13 ^ 2 \\left [ \\frac{100~{\\textrm{gev}}}{m_{\\tilde{b } } } \\right]^5 \\ .\\ ] ] this implies that scenarios 1 , 2 , and 3 make distinct predictions for collider phenomenology , and the identification of the gravitino collider signatures realized in nature may have far - reaching implications for the early universe .",
    "of course , this requires that gravitinos can be produced in sufficient numbers and distinguished from standard model backgrounds . in this work , we determine event rates for a variety of signatures , including prompt di - photons and delayed and non - pointing photons ( relevant for neutralino - nlsp scenarios ) , as well as kinked charged tracks and heavy metastable charged particles ( relevant for stau - nlsp scenarios ) .",
    "we present results for an assumed final tevatron dataset ( @xmath0 of @xmath14 @xmath15 collisions ) , an early lhc dataset ( @xmath1 of @xmath16 @xmath17 collisions ) , and a future lhc dataset ( @xmath18 of @xmath19 @xmath17 collisions ) .",
    "we find that the final tevatron and early lhc data have roughly equivalent sensitivity to these events , with both capable of seeing hundreds of distinctive light gravitino events .",
    "the full lhc data greatly extends the reach in parameter space , and may also allow precision measurements of nlsp lifetimes and gravitino masses .",

    "in the currently canonical scenario , after inflation , the universe is reheated to a temperature @xmath20 that is assumed to be far higher ( e.g. , @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) than the weak scale . during this phase , inelastic scattering processes and decays",
    "can convert standard - model particles in the thermal bath into gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "the rate @xmath23 per unit volume for production of light gravitinos ( strictly speaking , only the spin-1/2 goldstino components ) can be calculated by considering all such processes , which primarily involve strong  @xcite and electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite , as well as top quarks  @xcite .",
    "the total result , valid in the limit @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the scale of the superpartner masses , is  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the planck mass .",
    "here we have assumed that the gaugino masses @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and the tri - linear scalar coupling @xmath31 are at a common mass scale . for simplicity ,",
    "we have set them equal to a universal gaugino mass @xmath32 .",
    "the evolution of the gravitino number density @xmath33 via these production processes , and their inverses , is governed by the boltzmann equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath36 is the rate of processes that annihilate gravitinos .",
    "the @xmath37 term accounts for dilution of the number density due to cosmological expansion .",
    "if @xmath38 , gravitinos are in thermal equilibrium , @xmath39 , and their number density ( the solution to the boltzmann equation ) is @xmath40 here we used @xmath41 , since it is primarily the spin-1/2 goldstino components that are produced thermally .",
    "the rate @xmath36 at which a given gravitino is destroyed in the plasma is then @xmath42 since @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the ratio @xmath45 is largest at the highest temperatures .",
    "thus , if @xmath46 at reheating , then gravitinos come into thermal equilibrium shortly after reheating . during this era , the expansion rate is given by @xmath47 ; assuming reheating temperatures @xmath48 , at which all particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are relativistic , we set the number @xmath49 of relativistic degrees of freedom to @xmath50 . comparing @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we then see that if the reheating temperature satisfies @xmath53 ^ 2 \\left [ \\frac{{\\textrm{tev}}}{m_{\\tilde g } } \\right]^2 \\ , \\label{eqn : treheat}\\ ] ] then gravitinos come into thermal equilibrium after reheating . recalling that the production rate , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cg ] ) , used here is valid only for @xmath54 ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , we conclude that for weak - scale gluino masses , light gravitinos with @xmath56 will come into thermal equilibrium if the reheating temperature is @xmath57 .",
    "the creation / annihilation rates for gravitinos at temperatures @xmath58 have not yet been calculated , and so the precise temperature at which gravitinos freeze out ( which occurs when @xmath59 ) can not yet be determined .",
    "still , gravitinos are produced and destroyed individually , requiring ( from r - parity conservation ) that each creation / destruction is accompanied by creation / destruction of some other supersymmetric particle .",
    "therefore , the freezeout temperature @xmath60 can not be much lower than the mass @xmath61 of the nlsp , as the equilibrium abundance of susy particles then decreases exponentially .",
    "we thus conclude that the freezeout temperature for light gravitinos falls roughly in the range @xmath62 .    with this range of freezeout temperatures , @xmath63 ,",
    "so gravitinos are relativistic when they freeze out .",
    "the relic gravitino density is then  @xcite @xmath64      \\left[\\frac{106.75}{g_{*s , f}}\\right ] \\ , \\label{eqn : thermalabundance}\\ ] ] the standard result for hot relics with @xmath41 , where @xmath5 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom when the gravitinos freeze out .",
    "if gravitinos freeze out when all of the mssm degrees of freedom are relativistic , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "however , it is more likely that freeze out occurs at @xmath67 , when @xmath68 @xcite .      given that current cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) and structure - formation measurements constrain the density of dark matter to be @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermalabundance ] ) implies an upper bound @xmath70 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath71 is saturated if the gravitino makes up _ all _ of the dark matter and freezeout occurs when @xmath66 is the maximum value allowed in the mssm",
    ". however , a gravitino of this mass would be hot dark matter .",
    "it would smooth density perturbations on scales probed by galaxy surveys and the lyman-@xmath9 forest to a degree that is highly inconsistent with data .",
    "as @xmath2 is reduced from this upper limit , the smoothing scale is increased ( the gravitinos get `` hotter '' ) , but the gravitino abundance is reduced , thus making the magnitude of the smoothing smaller .",
    "a combination of data from the cosmic microwave background , galaxy surveys , and the lyman-@xmath9 forest constrain the contribution of a hot component of dark matter to be @xmath72  @xcite , implying for @xmath73 that @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests that the most conservative upper bound is given by @xmath75 , in the case that @xmath76 approaches the maximal value allowed in the mssm .",
    "therefore , in this canonical scenario , thermal gravitinos with mass less than @xmath77 make up only a fraction of the dark matter , thus requiring some other particle to be the cold dark matter .",
    "this is the first cosmological scenario listed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "we conclude by noting that future astrophysical data are likely to improve . and while the current sensitivity is to gravitino masses as small as @xmath78 , it is forecast that next - generation experiments may be sensitive to gravitino masses as small as @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "a collider detection of a gravitino in the mass range @xmath80 would thus lead to testable consequences in forthcoming cosmological data .",
    "there are several ways in which the early - universe production of relic gravitinos could differ from the canonical scenario outlined above .",
    "thus , there are scenarios in which a gravitino of mass @xmath81 , ruled out in the canonical model , could be cosmologically consistent or , better yet , completely compose the dark matter .",
    "let us first consider scenarios in which the gravitinos reach thermal equilibrium in the early universe , since most observational constraints are strictly valid only under this assumption . as mentioned above , if we only consider particles in the mssm , then @xmath82 , and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermalabundance ] ) suggests an upper limit of @xmath83 from the relic abundance constraint .",
    "one way to evade this limit is to simply consider higher values of @xmath5 ; i.e. , gravitinos decouple and freeze out earlier than in the canonical scenario .",
    "this may be possible in models with more degrees of freedom than the mssm .",
    "more massive gravitinos that decouple earlier may then be viable , if they have an abundance that obeys the constraint @xmath84 .",
    "it is possible that this constraint is saturated and that these heavier gravitinos entirely compose the dark matter . of course",
    ", we must still require that these heavier gravitinos are not so hot as to erase structure to a degree that contradicts observations .",
    "the same combination of cmb , galaxy - survey , and lyman-@xmath9forest data that was used to constrain @xmath75 in the canonical scenario can also be used to constrain the gravitino mass in this early - decoupling scenario , assuming that thermal gravitinos make up all of the dark matter . with this assumption , ref .",
    "@xcite find @xmath85 , using a selection of lyman-@xmath9 data .",
    "the same authors later find a stronger constraint , @xmath86 , with sdss lyman-@xmath9 data @xcite , a result slightly weaker than a bound on warm - dark - matter models obtained by ref .",
    "a number of other small - scale observations also seem to support that @xmath87 under these assumptions @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that if @xmath88 , then thermal gravitinos are too warm to be the only component of the dark matter , regardless of whether or not they have the correct abundance .",
    "gravitinos in this mass range would only be viable if some other non - standard early - universe process cools them , or if there is an additional cold component .",
    "this is the second scenario mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "however , if @xmath87 , then gravitinos may be sufficiently cold , and may in early - decoupling scenarios have the right abundance , to be the dark matter .",
    "this is the third scenario outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .    of course ,",
    "aside from early decoupling , there are other non - standard mechanisms that can reduce the gravitino abundance . for example , recall that we have no empirical constraints to the early universe prior to the epoch of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , at which @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "thus , some entropy - producing process prior to bbn could also dilute the gravitino abundance .",
    "it is possible that there may be some exotic early - universe physics that conspires to produce the same effect .",
    "one relatively simple possibility is that the reheating temperature is low .",
    "if the reheating temperature is smaller than the freezeout temperature , then gravitinos will never come into thermal equilibrium , and their relic abundance will thus be accordingly smaller  @xcite .",
    "the only catch is that for the light gravitinos we consider here , the reheating temperature must be unusually low for this to occur .",
    "for example , if @xmath90 and @xmath91 , then eq .  ( [ eqn : treheat ] ) suggests that the reheating temperature must be @xmath92 . however , recall that this estimate may not be strictly valid at @xmath58 , as we have already noted .",
    "thus , a more careful calculation of the production rate of light gravitinos at low reheating temperatures may be necessary .",
    "nevertheless , such low reheating temperatures have been considered @xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite has examined an explicit low - reheat scenario in which a gravitino of mass @xmath93 can have the right abundance to be the dark matter .",
    "finally , we also note that there may be additional mechanisms affecting the generation of gravitinos .",
    "for example , in our discussion we have neglected the nonthermal contribution to the gravitino abundance from out - of - equilibrium decays of other supersymmetric particles .",
    "there may also be other significant modes of gravitino production or dilution , including processes involving the messenger particles responsible for gmsb  @xcite , nonthermal production via oscillations of the inflaton field  @xcite , and various other mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "there may thus be other reasons why the gravitino abundance or temperature differs from those in the canonical thermal - production scenario ; this may be true even if @xmath75 .    to summarize , in the canonical model , gravitinos are required to have mass @xmath75 and form only a fraction of the dark matter .",
    "gravitinos with mass range @xmath94 would require non - standard physics or cosmology to reduce their abundance or temperature to agree with observations .",
    "below we discuss collider signatures of light gravitinos .",
    "we close here by noting that such collider data may , if gravitinos are discovered , thus help discriminate between the diversity of early - universe scenarios for gravitino production .",
    "the gravitino mass is determined by the super - higgs mechanism . in simple models ,",
    "it is given in terms of the supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath95 , which has mass dimension 2 , as @xmath96 ^ 2 \\ , \\label{mass}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the interactions of weak - scale gravitinos are of gravitational strength , as expected since they are the superpartners of gravitons . however , the couplings of the goldstino are proportional to @xmath98 @xcite",
    ". the interactions of light gravitinos are therefore dominated by their goldstino components , and may be much stronger than gravitational .",
    "decays to gravitinos are faster for light gravitinos .    for reasons to be discussed below , we will focus on cases where the nlsp is either the neutralino or the stau . for a neutralino nlsp that is dominantly a bino , the decay widths to gravitinos are  @xcite @xmath99 ^ 4 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the weak mixing angle . for @xmath101 , decays to @xmath102 bosons are negligible or kinematically forbidden , and the corresponding decay length is @xmath13 ^ 2 \\left [ \\frac{100~{\\textrm{gev}}}{m_{\\tilde{b } } } \\right]^5 \\ .\\ ] ] for heavier neutralinos , the @xmath102 mode may be significant ; for very heavy binos , the branching ratio for this mode is @xmath103 .",
    "decays to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a charged lepton , and @xmath106 may also be possible ; however , these modes have branching ratios of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .    for stau nlsps ,",
    "the decay width is  @xcite @xmath109 corresponding to a decay length @xmath110 ^ 2 \\left [ \\frac{100~{\\textrm{gev}}}{m_{\\tilde{\\tau } } } \\right]^5 \\ .\\ ] ]    as anticipated , in both the neutralino - nlsp and stau - nlsp scenarios , the decay lengths for gravitinos in the cosmologically interesting range correspond to distances that bracket the size of collider detectors .",
    "light gravitinos are expected to be dominantly produced at colliders in the cascade decays of strongly - interacting superpartners , such as squarks and gluinos .",
    "collider constraints therefore depend on the full superpartner spectrum , and so are model - dependent . following most of the literature , we will work in the framework of minimal gmsb , and so we briefly review its features here .",
    "typical gmsb models are characterized by a hidden sector , a messenger sector , and a visible sector , the mssm .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is triggered by a hidden - sector gauge - singlet superfield @xmath111 acquiring the vacuum expectation value @xmath112 .",
    "this then generates masses for the messenger - sector fields @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a coupling in the superpotential .",
    "these in turn generate masses for the visible - sector superpartners that are roughly a loop factor times @xmath115 , and so @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath117 is generally assumed .    in the minimal gmsb framework ,",
    "the entire superpartner spectrum is specified by the parameters @xmath118 here , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are as described above ; masses and couplings are generated at @xmath120 and then evolved to the weak scale via the renormalization group . the number of messenger superfields is given by @xmath121 , the effective number of @xmath122 representations of su(5 ) .",
    "the higgs sector is specified by the usual parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the last parameter is @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the total supersymmetry - breaking vacuum expectation value , which appears in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) .",
    "these relations imply @xmath127 we expect @xmath128 , since @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and in the minimal case that there is only one non - zero @xmath95-term , we expect @xmath131 .",
    "the superpartner masses are determined by the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) ; for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we note only two things .",
    "first , the superpartner masses are determined by gauge couplings .",
    "thus , although , for example , chargino  @xcite and sneutrino  @xcite nlsps have been considered , the canonical nlsp candidates are those with only hypercharge interactions , namely , the bino and right - handed sleptons . among the right - handed sleptons ,",
    "the stau is typically the lightest , as renormalization - group evolution and left - right  mixing effects both decrease the stau mass relative to the selectron and smuon , and so we will focus on the bino - nlsp and stau - nlsp scenarios .",
    "and @xmath132 decays may be comparable to that of the @xmath133 decay that usually dominates gravitino production . ]",
    "second , the bino and stau masses are proportional to @xmath121 and @xmath134 , respectively . for @xmath135 ,",
    "the nlsp is the bino in minimal gmsb , but for @xmath136 , the stau may also be the nlsp ; see , for example , fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "thus , to study the bino - like neutralino - nlsp scenario , we will choose @xmath135 ; likewise , we choose @xmath137 to study the stau - nlsp scenario .",
    "for both scenarios , we fix @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "we let @xmath119 and @xmath120 be free parameters .",
    "note that the overall mass scale of the supersymmetric partners is roughly proportional to @xmath119 , while the gravitino mass depends on both @xmath119 and @xmath120 as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mg ] ) .",
    "thus , scanning over the free gmsb parameters will allow us to explore collider signals for a range of masses .",
    "we shall now examine the existing collider constraints on the parameter spaces of these two scenarios .",
    "the high - energy collider signals of gmsb and gravitinos are well studied  @xcite ; for a review of current bounds , see ref .",
    "here we summarize the most relevant results for the models and signals we consider below .",
    "we shall discuss gmsb signals in more detail below , but we summarize them briefly here . in the neutralino - nlsp scenario , there are several possible signals . for short - lived neutralinos ,",
    "all supersymmetry events include two prompt high energy photons . for longer - lived neutralinos that travel a macroscopic distance before decaying to photons in the detector , delayed or non - prompt photons",
    "are possible .",
    "the stau - nlsp scenario may also lead to a variety of signatures , depending on the stau lifetime , including acoplanar leptons , tracks with large impact parameters , kinked charged tracks , and heavy metastable charged particles .",
    "several studies have attempted to place constraints on gmsb models by searching for these signals . given that we will scan over a large range of the gmsb parameter space , we are primarily interested in constraints that are generally valid over this entire range",
    ". we shall thus focus on limits from lep studies , based on an integrated luminosity of @xmath141 at center - of - mass energies of @xmath142 , which combined searches for both gmsb and neutral - higgs signals  @xcite .",
    "the relevant results for our models are the lower limits of @xmath143 for our neutralino - nlsp model , and @xmath144 for our stau - nlsp model ; see fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "these constraints on @xmath119 are valid for all values of @xmath120 we include in our scan .",
    "therefore , the allowed region of @xmath145 parameter space is constrained by these lep bounds .    however , there are also a number of studies that focused on constraining specific benchmark models  @xcite , which occupy certain points or lines in the gmsb parameter space .",
    "although these constraints can not be directly applied to our models , we discuss them to get an idea of the robustness of the lep bounds on our parameter space .    of these benchmark - model constraints ,",
    "the best collider bounds on di - photon events are from the tevatron , including a d0 search based on an integrated luminosity of @xmath146  @xcite and a cdf search based on @xmath147  @xcite .",
    "the d0 and cdf bounds , when interpreted assuming the benchmark gmsb model sps 8 from ref .",
    "@xcite , lead to lower bounds on the bino mass of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively . for longer - lived neutralinos that travel a macroscopic distance before decaying to photons in the detector , a cdf search for delayed photons , based on @xmath150 of data , established lower bounds on @xmath151 from 70 to 100 gev for neutralino decay lengths between 20 cm and 6 m , again when interpreted in the context of sps 8  @xcite .",
    "searches for heavy metastable charged particles have also been performed at d0  @xcite , assuming the benchmark gmsb model sps 7 from ref .",
    "a similar search was performed at cdf  @xcite , but did not interpret results in the context of gmsb models .",
    "based on @xmath152 of data , and assuming only drell - yan slepton production , the constraints resulting from these two searches are not competitive with the lep bounds stated previously .",
    "thus , we shall take the more general lep bounds as constraints on the two models we consider in this work , and shall further take only conservative values of the lower limits . for the neutralino nlsp model , we shall only scan the parameter space with @xmath153 , which should be comfortably allowed by the lep bounds .",
    "however , we acknowledge that it is possible that the tevatron data may exclude a small range of nlsp masses within this parameter space comparable to that ruled out in the benchmark model ( i.e. , @xmath154 ) , should this data be reanalyzed in the context of our models . for the stau nlsp model",
    ", we shall scan over @xmath155 .",
    "given that the current tevatron constraints are not competitive with the lep bounds , all of this parameter space should be allowed .",
    "as we will see , hadron colliders have bright prospects for probing the parameter spaces of these models .",
    "the collider signal of a supersymmetric particle decaying to a gravitino can be classified by ( 1 ) the distance from the interaction point at which the decay occurs , and ( 2 ) the nature of the accompanying standard model decay products .",
    "the former is determined by the gravitino mass and the masses of the decaying supersymmetric particles , as well as the speed with which the decaying particles are produced .",
    "the latter is determined primarily by the nature of the nlsp .",
    "we shall define and investigate the following categories of events :    1 .",
    "prompt di - photons ( in neutralino nlsp models ) : events in which two photons are produced ( via a pair of neutralino decays to gravitinos ) within @xmath156 of the interaction point .",
    "we take @xmath157 as a conservative estimate of the distance to which the origin of any photon can be resolved in detectors at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "note that here and below , we cut on the total distance traveled by the nlsp before it decays , not its ( transverse ) distance from the beamline when it decays .",
    "non - prompt photons ( neutralino nlsp ) : events in which at least one photon is produced at a mid - detector distance @xmath158 away from the interaction point , where @xmath159 , and @xmath160 is the maximum distance from the interaction point at which a photon can be observed .",
    "we conservatively take @xmath161 , roughly the outer radius of the hadronic calorimeters at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "( note that although the calorimeters in the atlas detector at the lhc actually extend to @xmath162 , those in the cms detector only extend to @xmath163 ; we have thus taken the more conservative @xmath164 as our cut . )",
    "photons may also convert and be seen in the muon chambers , extending the sensitivity to decays @xmath165 from the interaction point , but we neglect this possibility here .",
    "here we also take @xmath166 .",
    "+ note that this category of events encompasses both non - pointing photons and delayed photons .",
    "a non - pointing photon is simply a photon that does not spatially point back to the interaction point .",
    "a delayed photon has the further distinction of being produced only after a significant temporal delay following the time of the initial collision .",
    "this may occur when the particle that decays to the photon is produced with a low speed , so that it takes a non - negligible amount of time to travel away from the interaction point before it decays .",

    "however , as the mass splitting between the stau nlsp and the heavier sleptons decreases , these 3-body decays become less dominant ( becoming kinematically forbidden if the mass splitting becomes less than the tau mass ) . the decays to @xmath178 may then occur if the heavier sleptons @xmath182 are produced at the end of a decay chain .",

    "this categorization of events is somewhat oversimplified , as it is based primarily on cuts on the decay length .",
    "certainly , additional cuts will be required in a realistic analysis , possibly reducing the number of detected signals .",
    "however , we shall soon see that these simple categories align with the three cosmological scenarios outlined previously .",
    "we now calculate the event rates for these gravitino signals in a parametrized gmsb model .",
    "a large number of programs have been written for the numerical computation of the mass spectra and collider predictions for parametrized supersymmetric models @xcite . in this paper , we use isajet 7.80/isasusy  @xcite to generate mass spectra and decay branching ratio tables .",

    "we can also find the decay length @xmath158 away from the interaction point that each mother particle travels before decaying to produce a gravitino .",
    "thus , for any number of simulated events , we can find the fraction that fall into each of the above categories .",
    "the expected number of signals from each category is then given by the respective fraction multiplied by the total number of supersymmetric events .",

    "we can see that the simple categorization of collider signals by decay - length cuts corresponds surprisingly well with the categorization of cosmological scenarios outlined previously .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : neutp ] shows that the observation of hundreds of prompt events suggests that the first cosmological scenario ( @xmath75 ) is likely to be valid .",
    "likewise , the second cosmological scenario ( @xmath197 ) will be implied by the observation of a large number of non - prompt events , as demonstrated by figs .",
    "[ fig : neutnp ]  and  [ fig : staunp ] . finally , that the observation of a large number of metastable sleptons supports the third cosmological scenario ( @xmath87 ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : staums ] .",
    "we emphasize that this correspondence is not strongly dependent on our specific choice of gmsb models .",
    "it is indeed a remarkable coincidence that theoretically - motivated supersymmetric and gravitino mass scales , the physical sizes of collider detectors , and gravitino cosmology all conspire to allow this correspondence .",
    "note also that we find that the number of gravitino events produced during the initial run of the lhc ( center - of - mass energy of @xmath16 and integrated luminosity of @xmath1 ) may be comparable to that produced during an extended run of the tevatron ( center - of - mass energy of @xmath14 and integrated luminosity of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is true in regions of parameter space where large numbers of signals are expected .",
    "however , the higher center - of - mass energy of the lhc allows it to access regions of parameter space where @xmath25 is larger ; this is especially evident in the neutralino - nlsp scenario , as can be seen by comparing the left and middle panels in both figs .",
    "[ fig : neutp ]  and  [ fig : neutnp ] .",
    "if the distribution of mother - particle decay lengths can be measured with sufficient accuracy along with the total signal rate , then it may be possible to gain some information on the masses of the mother particles and the gravitino . to do so",

    "<S> light gravitinos , with mass in the ev to mev range , are well - motivated in particle physics , but their status as dark - matter candidates is muddled by early - universe uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how upcoming data from colliders may clarify this picture . </S>",
    "<S> light gravitinos are produced primarily in the decays of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle , resulting in spectacular signals , including di - photons , delayed and non - pointing photons , kinked charged tracks , and heavy metastable charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the tevatron with @xmath0 and the 7 tev lhc with @xmath1 may both see evidence for hundreds of light - gravitino events . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this collider data is also well suited to distinguish between currently viable light - gravitino scenarios , with striking implications for structure formation , inflation , and other early - universe cosmology . </S>"
