    "over 10 years passed from the discovery in cuprates superconductivity with a high critical temperature , however , its nature and the mechanism leading to superconductivity have not been yet identified in a conclusive manner .",
    "there are many experimental facts , which suggest a significant role of magnetic and charge - charge interactions in formation of the superconducting phase ( e.g. in cuprates and bismuthates , respectively ) .",
    "the simplest model describing the physical situation in such compounds and taking into account electronic correlations on the lattice is the hubbard model .",
    "an important question , which arises is a mechanism of formation of cooper pair in the presence of strong coulomb onsite repulsion . in some circumstances",
    "even not strong intersite coulomb interactions , as that one for correlated hopping , overwhelm onsite repulsion and lead to superconductivity for hole hoping .",
    "[ @xcite ] recently the 1d hubbard model with correlated hopping was analyzed for the case when the hopping integral @xmath0 is equal to the correlated hopping integral @xmath1 .",
    "[ @xcite ] exact results were obtained by using the conservation of the number of doubly occupied sites in the model and mapping it onto a system of spinless free fermions with twisted boundary conditions  [ @xcite ] , or in a equivalent way , by expression of the model by slave bosons , construction of the eigenstates and minimizing the energy with respect of number of doubly occupied sites .",
    "[ @xcite ] the superconducting phase was found as a ground state for the onsite coulomb integral @xmath6 ( @xmath2 is the concentration of electrons ) . in the case of strong attraction , @xmath7 , in the ground state",

    "the other type of intersite interactions may destabilize superconductivity .",
    "the density - density coulomb interactions lead to the charge density wave ( cdw ) ordering for @xmath3 .",
    "the stability conditions of the cdw were studied in an exact manner for @xmath3 and @xmath11 by strack et al .",

    "<S> the slave boson mean - field studies of the ground state of the hubbard model with correlated hopping were performed . </S>",
    "<S> the approach qualitatively recovers the exact results for the case of the hopping integral @xmath0 equal to the correlated hopping integral @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram for the strongly correlated state with only singly occupied sites , the weakly correlated state , where single and double occupation is allowed , and for the superconducting state , was determined for any values of @xmath1 and any electron concentration @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> at the half - filled band ( @xmath3 ) a direct transition from the superconductor to the mott insulator was found . in the region of strong correlations </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting solution is stable for @xmath2 close to 1 , in contrast to the case of weak correlations , in which superconductivity occurs at @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we found also that strong correlations change characteristics of the superconducting phase , e.g. the gap in the excitation spectrum has a nonexponential dependence close to the point of the phase transition . </S>"
