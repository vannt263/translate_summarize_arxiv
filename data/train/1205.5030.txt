    "however , the blending and confusion of irac sources , due to the larger psf ( 1.7  at 3.6@xmath5 ) , might contribute to spuriously increasing the identification rate . to quantify this effect , we ran the likelihood procedure assuming the same background sources distribution used above , the same @xmath47 ( this is a conservative choice given that a fainter sample implies a lower @xmath47 to maximize completeness and reliability ) and decreasing the flux of the objects with 5  from the x - ray position by a factor of 2 .",
    "the number of _ sub - threshold _ sources increases to 5.5% , which is still a low number and comparable to the results obtained in the k band .",

    "the x - ray flux , with a typical extremely hard spectral slope , has a positive k - correction , increasing with redshift and boosting the x - ray flux . on the contrary , in the optical , their sed",
    "is dominated either by galaxy starlight or by dust attenuated nuclear emission or by a combination of both .",
    "for these reasons , the k - correction works in the opposite direction with respect to the x - ray one : moving to high redshifts , the faint rest frame optical / uv emission is shifted to the _ i _ band explaining the progressively faint optical magnitudes ( see a similar discussion in brusa et al .",

    "the result is that the change in observed x - ray flux with increasing redshift is smaller than the change in optical _",

    "unobscured sources have a similarly steep spectral slopes in both the optical and x - rays ( @xmath571 ) , thus the two k - corrections are similar .",
