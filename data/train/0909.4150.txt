    "the problem of describing the gravitational field of astrophysical bodies is of central importance in general relativity , both as an issue of principle and as a foundation for explaining the results of observations .",
    "it is an issue of principle because general relativity is believed to be the most accurate theory of the gravitational field .",
    "consequently , einstein s theory should accept the existence of exact solutions that correctly describe the gravitational field of realistic sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the explanation of effects observed at the astrophysical level is extremely important .",
    "astrophysical bodies are characterized in general by a non - spherically symmetric distribution of mass . in many cases , like ordinary planets and satellites ,",
    "it is possible to neglect the deviations from spherical symmetry ; it seems instead reasonable to expect that deviations should be taken into account in case of strong gravitational fields .",
    "the general metric describing the gravitational field of a rotating deformed mass was found in 1991 by quevedo and mashhoon @xcite and involves an infinite set of gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic multipoles .",
    "this is a stationary axisymmetric solution of the vacuum einstein s equations belonging to the class of weyl - lewis - papapetrou @xcite and is characterized , in general , by the presence of a naked singularity . to capture the main properties of the general solution @xcite",
    ", we concentrate for the sake of simplicity on the special case of the general solution that involves only three parameters : the mass @xmath0 , the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath1 and the mass quadrupole parameter @xmath2 of the source .",
    "this special case was first found by quevedo and mashhoon in 1985 @xcite .",
    "hereafter this solution will be denoted as the qm solution .",
    "the corresponding line element in prolate spheroidal coordinates ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath5 , @xmath6 is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 only and @xmath13 is a constant .",

    "all higher multipole moments can be shown to depend only on the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath28 the solution reduces to the extreme kerr spacetime irrespective of the value of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath13 complex , i.e. @xmath29 , requires a different definition of the quadrupole parameter in order to have real geroch - hansen moments and can be better discussed by using weyl cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we will not explore this case here .    in this work",
    "we analyze some geometric and physical properties of the qm solution .",
    "the limiting cases contained in the general solution suggest that it can be used to describe the exterior asymptotically flat gravitational field of a rotating body with arbitrary quadrupole moment .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the motion of particles on the equatorial plane .",
    "it turns out that the whole geometric structure of the qm spacetime is drastically changed in comparison with kerr spacetime , leading to a number of previously unexplored physical effects strongly modifying the features of particle motion , especially near the gravitational source .",
    "in fact , the qm solution is characterized by a naked singularity at @xmath30 , whose existence critically depends on the value of the quadrupole parameter @xmath2 . in the case",
    "@xmath3 ( kerr solution ) @xmath30 represents instead an event horizon .",
    "this bifurcating behaviour accounts for the above mentioned drastic changes with respect to the kerr metric .    due to the very complicated form of the metric",
    "most of the analysis will be performed numerically .",
    "the qm solution reduces to the kerr spacetime in the limiting case @xmath31 and to the erez - rosen spacetime when @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the general form of the qm solution ( see [ qmgeneral ] ) is equivalent , up to a coordinate transformation , to the exterior vacuum hartle - thorne solution once linearized to first order in the quadrupole parameter and to second order in the rotation parameter .      for vanishing quadrupole parameter",

    "it is interesting to mention that in the limiting case @xmath39 , the qm metric leads to the extreme kerr black hole solution , regardless of the value of the quadrupole @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this can be easily seen both at the level of the multipole moments ( [ elemm ] ) and ( [ magmm ] ) and by directly computing the limiting metric .",
    "the latter determines in turn the limit of applicability of the qm solution , since for values in the range @xmath40 the multipole moments and the metric both become complex .",

    "[ fig : ergo_k ] and  [ fig : ergo1to4 ] the ergoregions of kerr solution and qm solution ( for different values of the quadrupole parameter ) respectively .",
    "the situation is completely different .",

    "we note that if the presence of the quadrupole moment totally changes the situation with respect to the kerr spacetime , the smooth horizon of the kerr solution becoming a singular hypersurface in the qm solution , the properties of the naked singularity are also different with respect to the limiting case of the erez - rosen spacetime .    finally , the spectral index @xmath77 ( see [ npquant ] for the definition of @xmath77 in terms of weyl scalars ) shows that the solution is algebraically general . the real part of @xmath77 is plotted in fig .",
