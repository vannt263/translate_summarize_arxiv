    "critical current measurements of nb@xmath1sn wires are commonly interpolated and extrapolated using a set of empirical relations for @xmath21 , generally referred to as summers scaling  @xcite .",
    "although these relations show acceptable accuracy for the description of limited data ranges  @xcite , large discrepancies appear between the fitted values for @xmath22 and @xmath23 and actual measurements  @xcite . also at temperatures above about 13 k and for large compressive and tensile axial strains the summers scaling is inaccurate .",
    "it is thus not suitable for precise extrapolations of measured results across a wide range .",
    "these deficiencies are generally recognized and lead to continuing discussions in the literature on improvements  @xcite .",
    "presently , much of the interpretation of measured results and ensuing discussions remain largely empirical and the proposed relations depend , for a significant part , on the initial assumptions .",
    "a notable exception is the recent work by oh and kim  @xcite who use eliashberg theory  @xcite in their attempt to arrive at a better founded scaling formalism .    as an alternative to empirical approaches ,",
    "a series of relations resulting from microscopic theory exist for type ii superconductivity .",
    "although the critical current can not be related quantitatively to the microstructure , various bulk pinning force models have been developed  @xcite .",
    "these can be combined with theory on strain dependence  @xcite and the field - temperature phase boundary  @xcite .",
    "the latter have been shown to reasonably describe measurements on well defined , quasi - homogeneous laboratory samples  @xcite .",
    "it is questionable , however , whether such relations can directly describe the behavior of nb@xmath1sn in technical wires due to the inevitable presence of inhomogeneities .",
    "compositional inhomogeneities result from the a15 stability range from about 18 to 25  at.%  sn  @xcite , combined with the solid state diffusion processes during the a15 formation reaction in wires .",
    "the resulting sn gradients have been unambiguously detected in wires by compositional analysis  @xcite , property gradient measurements  @xcite and simulations  @xcite .",
    "these compositional inhomogeneities lead to significant changes in the electron - phonon interaction strength @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the interaction strength changes from the weak coupling bcs limit ( @xmath25 ) for 18 at.% sn to @xmath26 for the stoichiometric composition  @xcite . as a result , significant changes occur in @xmath4 with sn concentration  @xcite .",
    "since all stable a15 compositions from 18 to 25 at.% sn are observed in wires , a distribution of properties of about @xmath27 and @xmath28 will occur over the a15 volumes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it can be expected that also the strain state is far from homogeneous over the a15 volumes in a wire .",
    "these arguments render the validity of a full microscopic approach doubtful .",
    "moreover , microscopic based relations can be relatively complex and use a significant number of parameters to describe the material involved .",
    "the main goal of this article is to find an improved scaling relation which balances the need for better founded formalisms and practical applicability to measured results in wires . as a starting point",
    "we use three central statements , which will be detailed further throughout the article .",
    "our first statement is that the temperature dependencies @xmath4 and @xmath29 ( the thermodynamic critical field ) are known .",
    "we showed earlier  @xcite that the shape of @xmath4 is constant for all available nb@xmath1sn results , independent of the sample layout , morphology , a15 composition , strain state or applied critical state criterion and also holds for inhomogeneity averaged , extrapolated , @xmath5 data .",
    "this means that the normalized temperature dependence of @xmath2 can be described by a single , known function from the microscopic theory .",
    "also @xmath29 is known  @xcite and @xmath30 immediately follows through @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this approach differs from the temperature dependence in the summers relation , in which @xmath4 is calculated from an estimated @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "our second statement is that non - linearities , which generally appear in kramer plots  @xcite when approaching the maximum @xmath2 that is present in a wire , can be attributed to a15 inhomogeneities .",
    "this assumption can be validated for specific wire layouts through a combination of simulations and measurements  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can chose to fit measured non - linearities assuming a different pinning model as is often done  @xcite .",
    "this will improve the quality of the fit per specific wire type when approaching the maximum @xmath2 , but this is also the regime where @xmath0 becomes very low .",
    "this regime is therefore of limited interest for applications .",
    "fitting this regime per wire type will obviously result in a reduced overall error but also in a model with significantly reduced generality .",
    "we therefore chose not to include such non - linearities in the model fit to arrive at a generally valid relation for all nb@xmath1sn wires , with a validity up to the regime where the effects of a15 inhomogeneity start to appear ( typically from about 80% of the maximum @xmath2 ) .",
    "our third statement is that the introduction of strain sensitivity occurs solely through strain induced changes in @xmath2 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "alternative approaches can lead to a strain dependent pre - constant in the @xmath21 relation  @xcite , which implies that the pinning efficiency changes with strain .",
    "although this can not be ruled out , it can be argued that the required change in pinning efficiency of at least a factor of 2 over the relevant strain regime ( below 1% axial strain )  @xcite , is unrealistically large .",
    "a more reasonable approach to our opinion , is to assume that the main effect of strain is a modification of the electron - phonon interaction spectrum , which is supported by recent calculations  @xcite .",
    "this will obviously change directly @xmath32 , @xmath2 and @xmath34 and thus @xmath33 .",
    "we will show below how this assumption , combined with a known temperature dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath34 leads to a consistent introduction of strain and temperature effects in the @xmath21 relation by stating that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that this is contrary to the usual unification of strain and temperature dependence , which assumes two separate and different dependencies on @xmath5 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "we will show below how these three starting points lead to a consistent , simple and accurate relation for @xmath21 . in section [ descriptions ]",
    ", we will summarize the descriptions that are available throughout the literature and arrive at a general form for @xmath21 . in section [ comparison",
    "] , we will systematically compare this general form to measurements to determine the resulting scaling relation .",
    "the overall accuracy will be demonstrated in section [ overall ] and discussed in section [ discussion ] , together with a determination of the minimal required set of measurements that are needed to fully characterize a specific wire .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density in nb@xmath1sn is determined by de - pinning of the flux - line lattice and thus by the magnetic field dependence of the bulk pinning force @xmath37 .",
    "the latter depends on the microscopic de - pinning mechanism . a general description for @xmath38 results from the observation that , for a multitude of low temperature superconductors , the bulk pinning force scales according to : @xmath39 as was first pointed out by fietz and webb  @xcite . in",
    ", @xmath40 is the reduced magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "the value for @xmath42 is often obtained by neglecting @xmath33 and plotting the maximum bulk pinning force against @xmath2 on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "values for @xmath42 found in this way are usually between 2 and 3 and for nb@xmath1sn values of 2 and 2.5 are mostly cited .",
    "however , since @xmath33 may change up to 50% with temperature ( section [ microkappa ] ) , its temperature dependence can not be neglected for an accurate description of the critical surface of nb@xmath1sn .    several models for @xmath43 exist  @xcite , but most often the kramer version is used .",
    "kramer derived two models for @xmath43 , using two regimes .",
    "for the regime below the peak in @xmath43 he assumed that flux motion primarily occurs by de - pinning of individual flux - lines , whereas in the regime above the peak in @xmath43 , de - pinning occurs by synchronous shear of the flux - line lattice around line pins which are too strong to be broken .",
    "the latter is referred to as the flux shear model and for this regime kramer proposed  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the elastic shear stiffness of the flux - line lattice , @xmath46 is the flux - line spacing and @xmath47 represents the density of the pinning planes . in bulk nb@xmath1sn , the grain boundaries are the main pinning centers  @xcite and can thus be interpreted as the pinning planes yielding @xmath48 , the average grain size .    one relation for the shear modulus of the flux - line lattice of a high field superconductor without paramagnetic limiting , was derived by labusch  @xcite : @xmath49 . \\label{labuschc66}\\ ] ] the flux - line spacing can be estimated by assuming a triangular flux - line lattice  @xcite : @xmath50 combining with , assuming @xmath48 and a triangular flux - line lattice with a spacing as given by results in : @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{kramerpinning}\\ ] ] using the kramer form therefore results in @xmath52 and @xmath53 in , if @xmath43 is defined as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which will be validated below .",
    "many authors indeed state @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "higher values for @xmath42 can be found if experimental results are described with non - kramer - like pinning .",
    "deviating values for @xmath42 in are reported by kroeger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who claim @xmath56 and by cheggour and hampshire  @xcite who state @xmath57 .",
    "it should be noted that both studies neglect @xmath33 and fit the experimental results to @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "this choice suggests different pinning behavior .",
    "it will be explained below that such high values for the power above @xmath60 can arise when sample inhomogeneities are ignored . here",
    ", they will be accounted for , which results in the experimentally supported assumption that @xmath61 , as will be discussed in more detail in section [ fp / fpmax ] .",
    "combining with the reverse definition of the lorentz force gives ( suenaga and welch in  @xcite ) : @xmath62    in most technical wires @xmath63 is 100 to 200 nm , whereas the flux - line spacing decreases rapidly below 50 nm for magnetic fields above 1 t. therefore @xmath64 and @xmath65 will approximately be linear in @xmath66 and can be referred to as a kramer function @xmath67 : @xmath68 a linear extrapolation of to @xmath69 then yields @xmath2 and the slope can be used to calculate @xmath33 .",
    "the kramer extrapolated critical field will be referred to as @xmath70 to distinguish it from a measured @xmath2 .",
    "the pinning force , as given by , peaks at @xmath71 if @xmath72 to yield the maximum pinning force : @xmath73.\\ ] ]      the dependence @xmath61 occurs when shear deformation of the flux - line lattice is the primary de - pinning mechanism as was mentioned above .",
    "this was shown experimentally by cooley _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to be the case when the grain size is substantially larger than the flux - line spacing @xmath74 . if the grain size is comparable to the flux - line spacing , a direct summation of individual pinning interactions between grain boundaries and flux - lines occurs , which corresponds to @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "plots of the kramer function @xmath67 from versus magnetic field ( a ` kramer plot ' ) , calculated from @xmath0 data measured on nb@xmath1sn conductors , are generally linear in the ` standard ' @xmath0 measurement regime of about @xmath76 .",
    "this supports shearing of the flux - line lattice as the primary de - pinning mechanism , provided that the grain size is larger than about 100 nm  @xcite .",
    "moreover , kramer plots resulting from magnetization data on powder - in - tube processed wires , reacted at various temperature and time combinations , were shown to be perfectly straight down to @xmath77 at various temperatures by fischer  @xcite .",
    "also transport @xmath0 measurements on different bronze processed wires indicated straight kramer plots at various temperatures down to @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "observed downward curvature when approaching lower magnetic fields can , apart from a different pinning behavior , additionally arise through self - fields generated by the large transport current densities .",
    "accurate correction for these self - fields is non - trivial .",
    "these observations validate the application of to very low fields and support the assumption that the @xmath79 term has negligible influence and can be approximated by @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , they indicate that for technical wires , which have an average grain size above 100 nm , shear deformation of the flux - line lattice apparently remains the primary de - pinning mechanism also below the maximum in @xmath81 .",
    "the assumptions used to arrive at the kramer model have received some criticism  @xcite . in practice , however , using the high magnetic field description of kramer appears to hold for nb@xmath1sn wires , at least down to 1 t.      above @xmath83 , non - linearities are mostly observed in kramer plots of wire results when approaching the maximum @xmath2 that is present in the wire .",
    "the pinning force function , combined with the approximation @xmath84 is therefore often written in a more general form : @xmath85 where @xmath17 is a constant and @xmath86 and @xmath87 determine @xmath43 .",
    "this allows for insertion of different values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 that implicate a different pinning behavior , but most probably originate from inhomogeneity averaging .",
    "such different values for @xmath86 and @xmath87 lead to still ongoing discussion in the literature whether or not a general pinning mechanism , or @xmath43 , can be assumed for nb@xmath1sn wires .",
    "the field dependence of the bulk pinning force as given by is shown in figure [ kramersim ] and combined with kramer plots for various values of @xmath87 around 2 .",
    "a variation of @xmath86 only influences the low field region .",
    "the aforementioned observations of perfectly straight kramer plots at lower magnetic fields for bronze and powder - in - tube processed wires , however , render strong deviations of @xmath86 from 0.5 unlikely .     calculated changes with @xmath87 in the field dependence of the bulk pinning force ( left plot ) and kramer function ( right plot ) . ]    a @xmath88 variation in @xmath87 results in a change in the maximum pinning force and its position and an up- or downward curvature in the kramer plot for @xmath89 .",
    "the effect of a lowering of @xmath87 , i.e. an increase of the maximum pinning force combined with a shift of its position towards higher magnetic field is identical to what has been observed experimentally through grain refinement in powder - in - tube wires by cooley _",
    "et al . _",
    "upward and downward tails in kramer plots have both been observed experimentally ( e.g. ekin in  @xcite ,  @xcite , suenaga in  @xcite ,  @xcite ) and have been attributed to microstructural  @xcite and compositional ( ekin in  @xcite ,  @xcite , cooley _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , suenaga and welch in  @xcite ) origins .",
    "a range of experimentally detectable @xmath90 values could also be attributed to flux - creep and thermal activated flux - flow ( e.g. the presence of an ` irreversibility field ' in high temperature superconductors ) , but we find that these effects are negligibly small compared to the severe influence of compositional inhomogeneities on @xmath90  @xcite , especially at temperatures below 20  k.    the most convincing support for attributing curvature in kramer plots when @xmath89 to inhomogeneities is given by cooley _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who numerically modeled the filaments in a powder - in - tube processed wire as concentric shells with different sn content and thus different @xmath2 and @xmath32 .",
    "it was assumed that each composition behaves according to @xmath91 .",
    "an area weighted summation of the transport current density of such a system of parallel paths of variable property showed that a concave tail appears in the overall kramer plots when the maximum available @xmath2 is approached .",
    "increasing the severity of the sn gradient in the a15 sections increases the occurrence of such tails in otherwise linear overall kramer plots .",
    "this parallel path model is supported by measurements on similar pit processed wires  @xcite .",
    "such an area weighted summation over parallel paths of lesser and better a15 quality results in a similar overall kramer plot as for @xmath92 and @xmath93 in figure [ kramersim ] . a downward tail in kramer plots , as is often observed in bronze processed wires , can be described with @xmath94 as is shown in figure [ kramersim ] , thereby again implicitly assuming a different de - pinning mechanism . however , assuming a serial connection of lesser and better a15 quality regions for the more irregular filaments in bronze processed wires , also results in a downward tail in kramer plots when @xmath89 , since the lower quality a15 sections will determine the overall transport properties .",
    "this argumentation is a strong indication that the curvature is not due to different de - pinning mechanisms but to inhomogeneity effects and thus that @xmath87 should be 2 .",
    "it can thus be stated that the kramer flux - line shear model , at constant composition , is valid over nearly the full magnetic field range , i.e. up to @xmath2 and down to a magnetic field where the flux - line lattice spacing becomes approximately more than half of the a15 grain size  @xcite , which is below 1 t from .",
    "non - linearities in kramer plots when approaching the maximum present @xmath2 are thus attributed to inhomogeneity averaging .",
    "the effective bulk values @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as detected by critical current measurements , are weighted averages over the a15 volume , but it is not always clear how the averaging occurs .",
    "the discussion above leads to the conclusion that there is no _ a priori _ reason to deviate from @xmath97 , provided that the inevitable presence of a15 inhomogeneities in wires is recognized .",
    "to come to an overall description for @xmath21 , the temperature dependence of the bulk pinning force is considered . in observing",
    "it is clear that temperature dependence occurs through temperature dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath33 : @xmath98^\\nu   } } { { \\kappa _ 1 \\left ( t \\right)^\\gamma   } } f\\left ( h \\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath99 .",
    "it is thus required to discuss the available descriptions for @xmath4 and @xmath30 . for both parameters , empirical as well as microscopic alternatives",
    "are available . in the summers relation",
    "@xcite empirical forms are used .",
    "it will be shown here , how these can be replaced by alternatives with a better connection to the microscopic theory .",
    "first , the empirical temperature dependence of the upper critical field , as used in the summers relation , is introduced .",
    "based on earlier work by suenaga in  @xcite and hampshire _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , summers _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an empirical relation for the temperature dependence of the upper critical field , thereby improving the correspondence between the available scaling relations and measured results : @xmath100,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .",
    "in this relation an empirical fit for @xmath101 is inserted in @xmath31 and @xmath102 is used for the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic critical field .",
    "it has to be emphasized that hampshire _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite claim a validity range only below 13.5 k for their calculated @xmath30 values .",
    "an early microscopic description for the temperature dependence of the upper critical field was simultaneously derived in 1964 by maki  @xcite and de gennes  @xcite which , written in the de gennes form yields the implicit relation ( mdg relation ) : @xmath103 the function uses only two parameters , namely @xmath22 ( which can be measured ) and the diffusion constant of the normal conducting electrons @xmath104 .",
    "the diffusion constant is inversely proportional to the slope of the @xmath4 dependence at @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the other parameters are the reduced planck constant ( @xmath105 ) , the magnetic flux quantum ( @xmath106 ) and the boltzmann constant ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the terms @xmath108 represent the digamma function  @xcite .",
    "the description was derived assuming a dirty superconductor ( i.e. @xmath109 ) , it uses a spherical fermi surface approximation and assumes a constant density of states at the fermi level @xmath110 and a weak electron - phonon interaction .",
    "furthermore it assumes no paramagnetic limitation of @xmath4 and an absence of spin - orbit scattering .",
    "a normalized form of with respect to temperature can be defined : @xmath111 in which @xmath112 represents @xmath4 calculated using .",
    "it can be convenient for practical applications to avoid the need to solve the implicit mdg relation by replacing it with an explicit expression .",
    "an approximation of for the entire temperature range yields : @xmath113 this power of 1.52 is practically identical to the value of 1.5 which was found from a similar fit as to ( partly ) extrapolated @xmath5 results by cheggour and hampshire  @xcite .",
    "a power of 1.5 was also found recently from analysis using eliashberg theory by oh and kim  @xcite .",
    "application of the full eliashberg based formalisms is the most correct approach , since it accounts for all the electron - phonon interaction strengths",
    ". however , there are two reasons for applying only the simplest form of the microscopic descriptions [ i.e. ] to wire results .",
    "first , since wires are inherently inhomogeneous there is no single @xmath4 but a distribution of properties  @xcite .",
    "also , the inaccessibility of the normal state resistivity ( which is a prime parameter in the microscopic theory ) of the a15 in wires renders a proper connection to the theory practically impossible .",
    "second , the use of the formal descriptions results in an increased number of parameters compared to .",
    "this can be avoided by implementing the additional parameters that are required for a proper connection to the microscopic theory in @xmath104 [ and thus in the slope at @xmath22  @xcite ] and @xmath22 in . to allow this",
    "it has to be assumed that the shape of @xmath4 , at least to first order , remains unchanged .",
    "the simplest form of the microscopic descriptions , the mdg relation , was tested previously and found to fit @xmath4 for all available literature nb@xmath1sn results and measurements on a multitude of wires with very high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "this accuracy holds for the orlando _ et al .",
    "_ thin film results  @xcite at all sn concentrations , the foner and mcniff single- and polycrystalline results  @xcite , and the jewell _ et al .",
    "_ bulk results  @xcite .",
    "the single crystals are close to stoichiometric and thus strong coupling  @xcite and most probably clean .",
    "the thin films and bulk samples are of varying degree of resistivity and sn content and cover therefore a large range from approximately clean to dirty and weak to strong coupling .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the shape of the field - temperature phase boundary is , within the experimental error bars , independent of the electron - phonon coupling strength ( which can also be confirmed from the theory  @xcite ) , independent on whether the material is clean or dirty , and not influenced by the ( unlikely  @xcite ) presence of ppl and spin - orbit scattering .",
    "it can thus be expected that it can be validated for the entire range of compositions that are present in wires .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that it also holds for kramer extrapolated , inhomogeneity averaged @xmath114 results  @xcite .      from the microscopic theory",
    "@xcite it follows that for weak coupling superconductors in the dirty limit @xmath115 . in the strong coupling limit this ratio saturates at about 1.5  @xcite , which means that the maximum expectable change in @xmath30 is 50% from 0 k to @xmath32 .    for calculation of @xmath101 for a given interaction strength the nonlinear eliashberg equations  @xcite will have to be solved as was done numerically by rainer and bergmann  @xcite .",
    "no general simple function for @xmath101 , derived directly from the electron - phonon spectrum and thus valid for all @xmath24 , can therefore be given for wires .",
    "fortunately , a generalized function can be derived for @xmath101 through @xmath31 , using the microscopic form for @xmath116 combined with the temperature dependence of @xmath34 .",
    "it is well accepted that @xmath117 is for all superconductors very close to @xmath118  @xcite .",
    "recent calculations based on eliashberg theory yield @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "the deviation from @xmath118 is measured for nb@xmath1sn  @xcite and is within about 2% .",
    "a fit to the measured @xmath117 yields @xmath120 . for practical applications a power of 2 will thus be sufficiently accurate . combining / or with @xmath31 and @xmath102",
    "thus yields : @xmath121 by implementing an accurate microscopic form for @xmath4 in the scaling relations also @xmath30 is accurately known , rendering an empirical version redundant .        when a nb@xmath1sn composite wire is subjected to longitudinal compressive strain , the critical current density , upper critical field and critical temperature reduce approximately linearly and reversibly with strain .",
    "when a wire is subjected to a longitudinal tensile strain , the critical parameters increase approximately proportionally and reversibly with strain until a parabolic - like peak is reached , after which the properties reduce approximately linearly with strain .",
    "the larger thermal contraction of the matrix materials compared to the thermal contraction of the nb@xmath1sn results in an axial pre - compression of the a15 when cooled from reaction temperature to the test temperature below 20  k. when the wire is axially loaded after cool - down , this pre - compression is minimized and @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath32 increase .",
    "the position of the maximum in the strain dependency curve appears at the point where the three - dimensional deviatoric strain components in the a15 are minimal . in practice",
    "this correlates closely to the point where the axial pre - compression of the a15 is minimal . the axial pre - compression is mostly identified by @xmath122 , whereas the position of the minimum in the deviatoric strain components is identified as @xmath123 .",
    "several models have been introduced in the literature to describe this behavior , ranging from polynomial fits to relations based on the eliashberg theory .",
    "these will be discussed below .",
    "when an a15 lattice is deformed , its vibration modes will change .",
    "in addition , the electronic structure will be modified and therefore @xmath110 .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect a strain induced variation of the electron - phonon interaction spectrum and the phonon density of states and hence , a change in the interaction constant @xmath24 .",
    "the difference between the strain sensitivity of @xmath2 and @xmath32 represents an important link to microscopic understanding since both depend differently on @xmath110 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is found experimentally that  @xcite : @xmath124 where the index ` @xmath125 ' indicates the values of @xmath2 and @xmath32 at the maximum of the axial strain dependency curve .",
    "the power @xmath126 , indicates that @xmath2 is roughly 3 times more sensitive to strain than @xmath32 .",
    "this was found to be valid at all temperatures ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an attempt was made by welch  @xcite , following earlier work by testardi  @xcite , to explain the observed difference in strain sensitivity on the basis of the strong coupling renormalized bcs theory , using a mcmillan  @xcite based , allan and dynes  @xcite strong coupling formulation for @xmath32 .",
    "it was concluded that @xmath126 can not be explained by either a change in @xmath110 or @xmath24 alone and the strain dependence should therefore be described by a combination of both .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that mcmillan based descriptions for @xmath32 are valid for @xmath127  @xcite , whereas reported values for nb@xmath1sn are mostly higher  @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that improved understanding of the value for @xmath128 should result from exact calculations of strain induced modifications on the full electron - phonon interaction spectrum and the density of states .",
    "this might be possible through a combination of the recent efforts of markiewicz  @xcite and oh and kim  @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion drawn by welch is that in a three - dimensional strain description the deviatoric strain components dominate the strain sensitivity of nb@xmath1sn and that hydrostatic components have , in comparison , a negligible effect .",
    "most strain dependencies are defined through the strain dependence of the upper critical field or the critical temperature .",
    "two general strain dependent terms will therefore be defined : @xmath129 under the assumption that @xmath18 is independent of temperature and @xmath126 .",
    "five models describing the strain sensitivity of nb@xmath1sn can be distinguished throughout the literature .",
    "the simplest form is an introduction of hydrostatic strain though a pressure term .",
    "although this yields a relatively simple connection to thermodynamic calculations to describe single crystal hydrostatic experiments , it is not suited for more practical systems such as wires due to the dominating deviatoric components .",
    "an empirical fit for axial deformations in wires was recently adapted by hampshire and co - authors  @xcite in the form of a fourth - order polynomial .",
    "although this will obviously result in accurate fits to experimental data , it lacks any connection to the underlying physics , and is thus not suited for the goals set out for this article .",
    "the three remaining models that have been proposed to describe experiments on wires will be discussed next in chronological order .",
    "the first model that was proposed to describe the strain dependence of the critical properties of nb@xmath1sn composite wires was the so - called power - law model , introduced by ekin in 1980  @xcite .",
    "the model was developed based on measurements using an axial pull strain device .",
    "the investigated compressive strain range was therefore limited to the thermal pre - compression of the a15 , introduced by the matrix components of the wires .",
    "a power - law dependence was proposed for @xmath18 using the extrapolated upper critical field  @xcite . in this power - law dependence , a different axial strain ( @xmath130 sensitivity is used for @xmath131 and for @xmath132 .",
    "the power - law model is an empirical description that does not account for the three - dimensional nature of strain , but includes the generally observed asymmetry in axial strain experiments .",
    "observable linearities at large compressive longitudinal strains are not accounted for and it is therefore valid over a limited strain regime .",
    "the second model that was proposed was the so - called deviatoric strain model . for high compressive strains ten haken found an approximate linear dependence of @xmath70 on axial strain , deviating from the power - law behavior  @xcite .",
    "these deviations from the power - law model at large compressive axial strain values , combined with results of experiments on quasi two - dimensional nb@xmath1sn tape conductors  @xcite ( which allow an analytical calculation of the three - dimensional strain components ) led to an alternative description based on the non - hydrostatic , i.e. distortional or deviatoric strain  @xcite . in this deviatoric strain model only the second strain invariant is considered .",
    "the model is empirical , does account for the three - dimensional nature of strain and linearity at large compressive axial strains , but is symmetrical around the maximum in the strain dependency curve , and is claimed to be valid only for the compressive strain regime .",
    "the third model available in the literature is the so - called full invariant strain analysis  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that the strain dependence of @xmath32 results from the strain dependence of the phonon modes in the nb@xmath1sn crystal lattice .",
    "the model uses a full invariant strain analysis which correlates the strain dependence of @xmath32 to strain induced changes in the phonon frequency spectrum using relations that stem from eliashberg theory and a strain energy potential function .",
    "the main result of the full invariant model is that it is able to demonstrate the effect of the harmonic and anharmonic terms in the strain energy potential function independently .",
    "it explains how the @xmath32 reduction due to hydrostatic strain decreases linearly with axial strain .",
    "it further explains the experimentally observed parabolic - like behavior around the maximum , the linearity for large compressive axial stain values and the asymmetry , in terms of the second and third strain invariants . for now , unfortunately , it does not include a description for @xmath15 , which is required for @xmath133 scaling .",
    "the latter might be provided by a combination of recent promising work by oh and kim  @xcite and a full invariant analysis .",
    "the full invariant analysis is the most proper method available for the introduction of strain dependency of the critical properties .",
    "the resulting relations , however , remain somewhat complex compared to the empirical fits , and a complete description for @xmath14 _ and _ @xmath15 is not fully developed yet .",
    "it is clear that the empirical models all lack specific details in comparison to the full invariant analysis . an empirical model that accounts for three - dimensionality , linearity at large axial strain , and asymmetry , in agreement with the invariant analysis ,",

    "our starting point is relation ( 3 ) in  @xcite : @xmath134 in which @xmath135 represents the second deviatoric strain invariant , @xmath136 represents the slope in the linear regime of @xmath137 , and @xmath138 represents the non - axial , remaining strain components when the axial strain is zero . in axial form can be written as  @xcite : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a constant and @xmath141 represents the remaining strain components , as with the factor @xmath138 in .",
    "to account , in the axial form of the ten haken model , for a stronger reduction at tensile strains , a linear term causing a reduction of @xmath70 with axial strain is required .",
    "this can be achieved by including an additional linear term in : @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are constants representing the second and third strain invariants .",
    "the term @xmath138 now represents the initial suppression of @xmath70 due to hydrostatic strain .",
    "a similar route can be followed for the axial version , resulting in : @xmath145 in which @xmath146 .",
    "the correction @xmath147 effectively rotates the strain dependency curve around its maximum .",
    "this causes the axial position of the maximum to shift by a factor @xmath148^{0.5}$ ] . for large asymmetry , @xmath123 ( the axial strain at which the minimum in the deviatoric strain occurs )",
    "will then deviate significantly from the observable axial position of the maximum @xmath122 .",
    "in axial strain experiments it is more convenient to normalize the strain dependence function to the observable maximum , also to avoid the introduction of an additional parameter through the use of @xmath123 in combination with @xmath122 .",
    "the rotation around the maximum also causes the normalized form to increase above 1 at the position of the maximum .",
    "this is undesirable since in scaling relations the reduction in e.g. @xmath70 is usually normalized to the maximum observable value at the peak of the measured strain dependency curve , and not to the ` strain free ' value since this is not accessible in an axial strain experiment .",
    "this can be prevented by re - normalizing @xmath18 to the maximum observable critical field value .",

    "<S> we review the scaling relations for the critical current density ( @xmath0 ) in nb@xmath1sn wires and include recent findings on the variation of the upper critical field ( @xmath2 ) with temperature ( @xmath3 ) and a15 composition . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of @xmath4 in inevitably inhomogeneous wires , as well as analysis of literature results , have shown that all available @xmath4 data can be accurately described by a single relation from the microscopic theory . </S>",
    "<S> this relation also holds for inhomogeneity averaged , effective , @xmath5 results and can be approximated by @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . knowing @xmath5 implies that also @xmath8 is known . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight deficiencies in the summers / ekin relations , which are not able to account for the correct @xmath8 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> available @xmath9 results indicate that the magnetic field dependence for all wires from @xmath10 up to about 80% of the maximum @xmath2 can be described with kramer s flux shear model , if non - linearities in kramer plots when approaching the maximum @xmath2 are attributed to a15 inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the strain ( @xmath11 ) dependence is introduced through a temperature and strain dependent @xmath12 and ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath13 and a strain dependent critical temperature @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this is more consistent than the usual ekin unification of strain and temperature dependence , which uses two separate and different dependencies on @xmath5 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> using a correct temperature dependence and accounting for the a15 inhomogeneities leads to the remarkable simple relation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant , @xmath18 represents the normalized strain dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a new relation for @xmath18 is proposed , which is an asymmetric version of our earlier deviatoric strain model and based on the first , second and third strain invariants . </S>",
    "<S> the new scaling relation solves a number of much debated issues with respect to @xmath0 scaling in nb@xmath1sn and is therefore of importance to the applied community , who use scaling relations to analyze magnet performance from wire results . </S>"
