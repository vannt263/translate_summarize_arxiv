    "<S> once again we use the logistic map @xmath97 as an illustration , and we choose for its first tangent bifurcation ( @xmath110 ) at @xmath111 one of the three critical positions , @xmath112 , and determine its expansion coefficient to be @xmath113 . </S>",

    "<S> naturally , only for very low order @xmath21 of the bifurcation and/or special values of the nonlinearity @xmath33 it is feasible to obtain algebraic solutions for the locations of the transitions and then for the leading expansion coefficient @xmath24 . </S>",

    "<S> as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 1st_pitch ] and [ tang ] the _ a priori _ numerical calculations for the simplest examples selected here provide a striking confirmation of our rg predictions for both @xmath1 and @xmath56 .    in summary , we have fully determined the dynamical behavior at the pitchfork and tangent bifurcations of unimodal maps of arbitrary nonlinearity @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> this was accomplished via the consideration of the solution to the feigenbaum rg recursion relation for these types of critical points . </S>",
    "<S> our study has made use of the specific form of the @xmath33-logistic map but the results have a universal validity as conveyed by the rg approach . </S>",
    "<S> the rg solutions are exact and have the analytical form of @xmath1-exponentials , we have shown that they are the time ( iteration number ) counterpart of the static fixed - point map expression found by hu and rudnick for the tangent bifurcations and that is applicable also to the pitchfork bifurcations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-exponential form of the time evolution implies an analytical validation of the expression for the sensitivity to initial conditions suggested by the nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides straightforward predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath56 in terms of the map critical point properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the index @xmath1 is independent of @xmath33 and takes one of two possible values according to whether the transition is of the pitchfork or the tangent type . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-generalized lyapunov coefficient @xmath56 is simply identified with the leading expansion coefficient @xmath24 . as we have shown these predictions are unquestionably corroborated by _ a priori _ numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , both families of bifurcations display non - canonical dynamical behavior ( either weak insensitivity or ` super strong ' sensitivity to initial conditions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the universal attribute of our results invites some reflection on the rationale for non - canonical dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this is most apparently linked to the fact that the tangency shape of the map at these critical points either effectively confines or expels trajectories causing an abnormal , incomplete , sampling of phase space ( here @xmath15 ) . </S>"
