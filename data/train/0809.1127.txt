    "synchronous firing of neurons has been widely observed and is considered to be a neural code that adds to firing rates .",
    "for example , experimental evidence suggests the relevance of synchronous firing in stimulus encoding @xcite , feature binding @xcite , and selective attention @xcite .",
    "collective dynamical states of neurons including synchrony may appear as a result of self - organization based on synaptic plasticity .",
    "modification of synaptic weights ( i.e. , weights of edges in the network terminology ) often occurs in a manner sensitive to relative spike timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons , which is called spike - timing - dependent plasticity ( stdp ) . in the commonly found asymmetric stdp , which we consider in this work , long - term potentiation ( ltp ) occurs",
    "when presynaptic firing precedes postsynaptic firing by tens of milliseconds or less , and long - term depression ( ltd ) occurs in the opposite case @xcite .",
    "the amount of plasticity is larger when the difference in the presynaptic spike time and the postsynaptic spike time is smaller @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric stdp reinforces causal pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes and eliminate other pairs .",
    "based on this property of stdp , how stdp may lead to various forms of synchronous firing has been studied in both experiments and theory .",
    "synchronous firing in the sense of simultaneity of spike timing can be established in recurrent neural networks when the strength of ltp and that of ltd are nearly balanced @xcite .",
    "large - scale numerical simulations suggest that reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of spike trains self - organize in heterogeneous recurrent neural networks @xcite .",
    "self - organization of clusters of synchronously firing neurons that excite each other in a cyclic manner has also been reported @xcite .",
    "we previously showed that stdp leads to formation of feedforward networks and entrainment when there is a pacemaker in the initial network @xcite .",
    "we considered random networks of coupled oscillators whose synaptic weights change slowly via stdp .",
    "we assumed that the oscillators have a common inherent frequency except a single pacemaker whose inherent frequency is larger . by definition , the rhythm of the pacemaker is not affected by those of other oscillators .",
    "the network generated via stdp is a feedforward network whose root is the pacemaker . in a final network",
    ", a spike packet travels from the pacemaker to the other neurons in a laminar manner .",
    "the neurons directly postsynaptic to the pacemaker fire more or less synchronously just after the pacemaker does .",
    "these neurons form the first layer .",
    "these neurons induce synchronous firing of the neurons directly postsynaptic to them , which define the second layer . in this fashion",
    ", a spike packet starting from the pacemaker reaches the most downstream neurons within relatively short time , which resembles the phenomenology of the synfire chain @xcite .",
    "compared to the case of frozen synaptic weights , a pacemaker entrains the rest of the network more easily with stdp in the meaning that entrainment occurs with smaller initial synaptic weights .",
    "the previous work does not explain how pacemakers emerge .",
    "no matter whether the pacemakers are intrinsic oscillators or network oscillators , they pace rhythms of other elements without being crucially affected by other rhythms .",
    "although some pacemakers may be  robust \" oscillators whose rhythms are insensitive to general input , a more natural explanation may be that pacemakers emerge through synaptic plasticity in a neural network in which pacemakers are initially absent . in this case ,",
    "emergent pacemakers do not have to be robust oscillators ; their rhythms can change in response to external input .",
    "the emergent network topology makes such neurons pacemakers by eliminating incoming synapses .",
    "a neuron would fire with its own rhythm if it is not downstream to any neuron .",
    "this scenario is actually the case for two - neuron networks @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned to networks of more than two neurons .",
    "an associated question is which oscillator may become a pacemaker .    in this work ,",
    "we numerically investigate recurrent networks of coupled phase oscillators subject to stdp .",
    "we show that , when the initial synaptic weights are strong enough , stdp indeed yields feedforward networks so that downstream neurons are entrained by an emergent pacemaker . to our numerical evidence ,",
    "the emergent pacemaker is always the neuron with the largest intrinsic frequency . below the threshold for entrainment",
    ", stdp leads to the segregation of the initial neural network into subnetworks of feedforward networks .",
    "we model dynamics of neural networks by @xmath0 coupled phase oscillators whose synaptic weights are plastic . although a majority of real neurons fire in the excitable ( i.e. , fluctuation - driven ) regime , for tractability we use phase oscillators , which fire in an oscillatory manner . generally speaking ,",
    "phase transitions are more easily and clearly determined in the oscillatory regime than in the excitable regime .",
    "this is a reason why collective neural dynamics @xcite including ones associated with stdp @xcite have been analyzed in the oscillatory regime actually to give insights into dynamics of neural networks possibly operating in the excitable regime . in the following ,",
    "we report numerical results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the state of neuron @xmath3 @xmath4 is represented by a phase variable @xmath5 .",
    "we identify @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 crosses @xmath9 in the positive direction , neuron @xmath3 is defined to fire .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the spike time of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons .",
    "if @xmath8 crosses 0 in the positive direction as time advances from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , we set @xmath14/[2\\pi+\\phi_i(t+\\delta t)-\\phi_i(t)]\\delta t$ ] .",
    "as the initial condition , we set @xmath6 @xmath4 for @xmath1 .",
    "we adopt this artificial initial condition to draw phase diagrams to systematically understand possible routes to synchrony via stdp . for @xmath2 , @xmath15",
    "is picked randomly and independently for each @xmath3 from the uniform density on @xmath16 .",
    "neuron @xmath3 is endowed with inherent frequency @xmath17 so that it fires regularly at rate @xmath18 when isolated .",
    "connectivity between neurons is unidirectional and weighted , consistent with the properties of chemical synapses .",
    "the set of edges in a network is denoted by @xmath19 . in other words , @xmath20 if neuron @xmath21 is presynaptic to neuron @xmath3 .",
    "dynamics of the coupled phase oscillators are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average in - degree of neuron @xmath3 , @xmath24 is a synaptic weight , and @xmath25 represents the standard gaussian white noise independent for different @xmath3 . as a result of the phase reduction theory @xcite , the coupling term in the oscillatory regime is generally given by a @xmath26-periodic function of the phase difference @xmath27 under the assumption of weak coupling .",
    "this is also the case for pulse coupling , for which averaging an original pulse coupling term over one oscillatory cycle results in a coupling term as a function of @xmath27 @xcite . modeling realistic synaptic coupling needs a coupling term that contains higher harmonics @xcite .",
    "however , our objective in the present paper is not to precisely describe the neural dynamics but to clarify general consequences of stdp under the oscillatory condition .",
    "we thus employ the simplest coupling term ( i.e sinusoidal coupling ) .    for @xmath1",
    ", we set the amplitude of the noise @xmath28 so that the phase transitions are sharp enough and artificial resonance that is prone to occur when inherent frequencies satisfy @xmath29 for small integers @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 is avoided .",
    "accordingly , an independent normal variable with mean 0 and standard deviation @xmath33 is added to each neuron every time step @xmath34 ; we use the euler - maruyama integration scheme with unit time @xmath35 . to determine the phase transitions for @xmath2 , we do not apply dynamical noise because , up to our numerical efforts , the numerical results do not significantly suffer from artificial resonance . in some other simulations with @xmath2 ,",
    "we add different amplitudes of dynamical noise to examine the robustness of the results .      with stdp , @xmath24 is repeatedly updated depending on spike timing of neuron @xmath21 and @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , ltp occurs when a postsynaptic neuron fires slightly after a presynaptic neuron does , and ltd occurs in the opposite case @xcite .",
    "we assume that synaptic plasticity operates much more slowly than firing dynamics .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the maximum amount of ltp and that of ltd incurred by a single stdp event . most of previous theoretical work supposes that @xmath37 is somewhat , but not too much , larger than @xmath36 , to avoid explosion in firing rates and to keep neurons firing @xcite .",
    "therefore we set @xmath38 .",
    "how a single spike pair specifically modifies the synaptic weight is under investigation @xcite , and triplets or higher - order combination of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes rather than a single presynaptic and postsynaptic spike pair may induce stdp @xcite .",
    "however , we consider the simplest situation in which stdp modifies synaptic weights in an additive manner and the amount of stdp is determined by the relative timing of a presynaptic and postsynaptic spike pair . a single synaptic modification @xmath39 triggered by a spike pair",
    "is represented by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the characteristic time scale of the learning window , which is known in experiments to be 10 - 20 ms @xcite . given that inherent frequencies of many pyramidal neurons roughly range between 5 and 20 hz , @xmath41 is several times smaller than a characteristic average interspike interval .",
    "therefore , following @xcite , we set @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a typical value of spike frequency that is used to determine @xmath44 . following our previous work @xcite , we set @xmath45 . because learning is slow compared to neural dynamics , @xmath37 must be by far smaller than a typical value of @xmath46 . to satisfy this condition , we set @xmath47 for @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath2 , average in - degree @xmath23 is set equal to 10 .",
    "this implies that a neuron receives about five to ten times more synapses than when @xmath1 . to normalize this factor",
    ", we set it @xmath48 for @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 is confined in @xmath49 $ ] ; all the synapses are assumed to be excitatory , because the asymmetric stdp explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] has been found mostly in excitatory synapses . because dynamical noise is assumed not to be large , all the synaptic weights usually develop until @xmath24 almost reaches either @xmath50 or 0 , until when we run each simulation run .",
    "note that , even if @xmath51 is reached , @xmath52 still belongs to @xmath19 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath50 is determined so that a notion of synchronization that we define in sec .  [",
    "sec : measure ] does not occur when @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "accordingly , we set @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .      to obtain the threshold for synchrony in secs .",
    "[ sec : small ] and [ sec:100 neurons ] , we start numerical simulations with the initial condition @xmath57 , @xmath54 . there are various notions of synchrony .",
    "we focus on the possibility of frequency synchrony in which neurons fire at the same rate . in the oscillatory regime ,",
    "frequency synchrony is commonly achieved in two main ways .",
    "one is when neurons are connected by sufficiently strong mutual coupling",
    ". then they oscillate at the same rate and with proximate phases .",
    "the other is when some neurons entrain others .",
    "when upstream neurons , which serve as pacemakers , entrain downstream neurons so that they are synchronized in frequency , synchronous firing in the sense of spike timing may be missing due to synaptic delay .",
    "however , neurons located at the same level in the hierarchy relative to the pacemakers tend to have close spike timing @xcite .",
    "we explore possible emergence of such dynamics when pacemakers are initially absent in networks .",
    "we quantify the degree of frequency synchrony by order parameter @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 , \\label{eq : criteria}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the actual instantaneous frequency of neuron @xmath3 when coupled to other neurons .",
    "if all the neurons fire exactly at the same rate , @xmath58 would become negative infinity .",
    "in the actual frequency synchrony , @xmath58 takes a large negative value mainly because of time discretization .",
    "we manually set @xmath61 for @xmath1 and @xmath62 for @xmath2 , so that @xmath63 corresponds to the full frequency synchrony .",
    "the value of @xmath64 for @xmath2 is smaller than for @xmath1 for two reasons .",
    "first , in the numerical simulations determining the degree of frequency synchrony , dynamical noise is present for @xmath1 and absent for @xmath2 .",
    "second , we are concerned to the frequency synchrony of _ all _ the neurons so that @xmath65 is small regardless of @xmath0 ; we have to normalize the prefactor @xmath66 in eq .  .",
    "our goal is to understand dynamics of large neural networks . as a starting point , we examine network evolution and possibility of frequency synchrony using small networks , which will help us understand dynamics of large networks .",
    "two - neuron networks were previously analyzed @xcite .",
    "we need at least three neurons to understand competition between different synapses , pruning of synapses , and effects of heterogeneity .",
    "accordingly , we examine dynamics of different three - neuron networks under stdp .      consider the complete graph [ fig .",
    "[ fig : completescheme](a ) ] , in which every pair of neurons is bidirectionally connected .",
    "the complete graph does not survive stdp because ltp of a synapse implies ltd of the synapse in the reversed direction and the amount of ltd is assumed to be larger than that of ltp for the same time lag .",
    "we examine which synapses survive and whether frequency synchrony emerges through stdp .",
    "if a predetermined pacemaker exists in a network , the activity of the other neurons will be entrained into the rhythm of the pacemaker with sufficiently large initial synaptic weights , which was previously shown for @xmath67 and @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "we consider @xmath1 and compare numerical results when a pacemaker is initially present and absent in the complete graph .",
    "note that the effective initial network when the pacemaker neuron 1 is initially present is the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : completescheme](b ) , because the synapses toward the pacemaker are defined to be entirely ineffective .",
    "first , we examine the relation between heterogeneity in inherent frequencies , initial synaptic weights , and synchrony .",
    "we expect that small heterogeneity and large initial synaptic weights favor synchrony . to focus on phase transitions , we reduce the number of parameters by setting all the initial synaptic weights equal to @xmath68 and restrain inherent frequencies @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) by imposing , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",

    "the results are qualitatively the same for the two situations .",

    "neuron 2 entrains neuron 3 so that they oscillate at frequency @xmath70 , whereas neuron 1 gets disconnected and oscillates at frequency @xmath69 .",
    "we rarely observed the case in which neuron 1 entrains 2 ( or 3 ) and neuron 3 ( or 2 ) gets isolated . although @xmath83 , neuron 1 is more likely to segregate from the network than neuron 3 is .",
    "quantitatively speaking , figs .",
    "[ fig : complete](a ) and [ fig : complete](b ) indicate that the entrainment of the entire network by the fastest neuron ( i.e. , neuron 1 ) is to some extent easier to realize when the pacemaker is initially absent than present ( yellow regions labeled a ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : complete](a ) and [ fig : complete](b ) , the phase diagrams are disturbed along vertical lines at @xmath84 .",
    "this artifact comes from the fact that @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 approximately satisfy the resonance condition ( i.e. , @xmath85 with small integers @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ) . in some of the following figures",

    "we can wash away these artifacts by increasing the amount of dynamical noise .",

    "@xmath92 survive only when @xmath132 ( yellow , a ) .",
    "this phase extends to the disconnection phase ( blue , d ) on the diagonal because , on this line , the firing of neuron 1 elicits ltp of both synapses so does firing of neuron 2 .",

    "is consistent with the observations in _ c. elegans _ neural networks",

    "the error bar shows a range of one standard deviation based on ten simulation runs in each of which we draw a different initial random network and a different realization of @xmath44 ( @xmath175 ) . before stdp , the neural network is a directed random graph , so that the @xmath174 score for each pattern is around zero , meaning that no pattern is overrepresented or underrepresented significantly .",

    "[ sec : small ] because the two upstream neurons in pattern 4 have the same actual frequency .",

    "[ fig : network ] shows , existence of multiple paths from a neuron to another due to branching and uniting of edges is compatible with stdp",
    ". the other network patterns are not significant or underrepresented .",
    "these results are further evidence that feedforward networks are formed by stdp in heterogeneous neural networks .",
    "we have shown using heterogeneous coupled phase oscillators that feedforward networks spontaneously emerge via stdp when the initial synaptic weights are above the threshold value .",
    "when this is the case , the pacemaker emerges at the root of the feedforward network and entrains the others to oscillate at the inherent frequency of the pacemaker .",
    "although these results have been known for two - neuron networks @xcite , we have shown them for the cases of three and more neurons and quantified the phase transitions separating frequency synchrony and asynchrony .",
    "the route to frequency synchrony is distinct from a conventional route to frequency synchrony that occurs when mutual , but not one - way , coupling between oscillators is strong enough .",
    "some results obtained in this work are unique to the networks without a prescribed pacemaker .",
    "first , the emergent pacemaker is the fastest oscillator neuron according to our extensive numerical simulations .",
    "note that all the oscillators fire at this frequency in the entrained state , whereas they fire at the mean inherent frequency of the oscillators when the frequency synchrony is realized by strong mutual coupling in the absence of stdp .",
    "second , when the initial coupling strength is subthreshold , the neurons are segregated into clusters of feedforward networks .",
    "third , our numerical evidence suggests that entrainment under stdp occurs more easily when a prescribed pacemaker is absent than present .    in spite of a wealth of evidence that real neural circuits are full of recurrent connectivity @xcite , feedforward structure",
    "may be embedded in recurrent neural networks for reliable transmission of information @xcite .",
    "feedforward transmission of synchronous volleys in rather homogeneous neural networks as those used in this work serves as a basis of reproducible transmission of more complex spatiotemporal spike patterns in more heterogeneous networks .",
    "such patterns may code external input or appear as a result of neural computation @xcite .",
    "feedforward structure is also a viable mechanism for traveling waves often found in the brain @xcite .",
    "although computational roles of feedforward network structure are not sufficiently identified , our results give a support to the biological relevance of feedforward networks .",
    "the formation of feedforward networks , which we have shown for oscillatory neurons , is consistent with numerical results for more realistic excitable neurons subject to stdp @xcite .",
    "the neurons that directly receive external input may be more excited and fire at a higher rate compared to other parts of a neural circuit .",
    "our results suggest that such a neuron or an ensemble of neurons is capable of recruiting other neurons into entrainment and creating feedforward structure .",
    "we assumed the additive stdp with the nearest - neighbor rule in which the dependence of the amount of plasticity on the current synaptic weight and the effects of distant presynaptic and postsynaptic spike pairs , triplets , and so on , are neglected . generally speaking ,",
    "evolution of synaptic weights is affected by the implementation of the stdp rule @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that our results are robust in the variation of the stdp rule as far as it respects the enhancement of causal relationships between presynaptic and postsynaptic pairs of neurons .",
    "our preliminary numerical data with excitable neuron models suggest that the results are similar between the multiplicative rule @xcite and the additive rule [ kato and ikeguchi ( private communication ) ] .",
    "recent reports claim the relevance of acausal spike pairs in the presence of synaptic delay @xcite .",
    "this and other factors , such as different time scales of ltp and ltd @xcite , may let bidirectional synapses survive as observed in _ in vitro _",
    "experiments @xcite . incorporating these factors is an important future problem .",
    "we have ignored inhibitory neurons for two reasons .",
    "first , our main goal is to identify phase transitions regarding synchrony with a simple model .",
    "second , specific rules of stdp are not established for inhibitory neurons , albeit some pioneering results @xcite .",
