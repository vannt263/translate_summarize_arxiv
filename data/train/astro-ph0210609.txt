    "as the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe , clusters of galaxies are important tracers of the large scale distribution of matter . because the distribution of clusters depends sensitively on the underlying cosmology @xcite , improved",
    "tests of cosmological models require accurate measurements of the properties of many individual clusters .",
    "the masses of galaxy clusters and their internal matter distribution are of particular interest .",
    "three primary observational techniques have been widely used to derive the mass distribution in galaxy clusters : measurements of the galaxy velocity dispersion , modeling of gravitational lensing effects , and examination of x - ray emission from hot intra - cluster gas .",
    "most early measurements of cluster masses were based on optical observations of the motion of cluster galaxies .",
    "these measurements are complicated by the fact that cluster membership for individual galaxies is often uncertain .",
    "furthermore , although determination of cluster masses from the galaxy velocity dispersion is founded on the assumption that the cluster is virialized , the virialization requirement is often unsatisfied .",
    "many clusters are dynamically young and unrelaxed because the dynamical time scale for cluster formation is comparable to the hubble time ( richstone et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing studies infer the cluster mass from measurements of distortions produced in images of background galaxies .",
    "lensing studies have the advantage that they directly measure the total projected mass in all forms along the line of sight . in particular",
    ", the lensing mass includes both luminous and dark matter , independent of assumptions about the dynamical state of the cluster @xcite .",
    "however , lensing measurements give no information on the dynamical state of the cluster or the relative amounts of luminous and dark matter or the segregation of baryonic matter between galaxies and intra - cluster hot gas .",
    "x - ray observations of clusters provide complementary data , yielding a measure of the cluster mass which is independent of mass concentrations along the line of sight and also , through the plasma temperature map , yielding information on the dynamical state of the cluster @xcite . the intracluster gas provides a useful probe of the cluster mass because the gas rapidly attains hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster potential . in equilibrium ,",
    "the gas temperature is typically in the range @xmath6 kev , making the gaseous intracluster medium a prodigious source of thermal x - ray emission . using x - ray observations to measure the gas density and temperature and assuming spherical symmetry ,",
    "the radial mass distribution , @xmath7 , can be derived from the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath8 , \\label{hydrostat}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the gas density and @xmath10 is the gas temperature .",
    "detailed simulations indicate that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium can yield reasonably accurate cluster masses even in cases where the cluster has not completely relaxed , although the exact range of validity of this approach remains uncertain @xcite .    along with their cosmological implications , x - ray observations of galaxy clusters",
    "are also motivated by interest in the origin and evolution of the gaseous intracluster medium itself .",
    "one question which has been the focus of intensive effort for a number of years concerns the fate of the x - ray emitting gas . in a large fraction of dynamically relaxed clusters ,",
    "the radiative cooling time of gas in the cluster core is short compared to the hubble time . in the absence of a heat source capable of balancing losses due to cooling ,",
    "the intracluster gas is expected to settle inward in a `` cooling flow '' ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "previous x - ray estimates of the cooling rates ( @xmath11 ) revealed many clusters with @xmath12 and , in some cases , as high as @xmath13 .",
    "once it cools below x - ray emitting temperatures , the fate of the gas is unclear but , given the amount of material involved , some observable signature is expected .",
    "sustained over a hubble time , these cooling rates imply the accumulation of @xmath14 of material , but detailed examination of clusters at many wavelengths has so far failed to confirm the amount of cooling material inferred from x - ray observations or to reveal its final state .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued that the presence of a cooling flow can have an important affect on the cluster mass determination .",
    "recent comparisons between cluster masses determined from x - ray observations and from gravitational lensing have revealed disagreements in the sense that the lensing value is sometimes larger than the x - ray determined value . however , allen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have argued that , at least for relaxed clusters , better agreement can be obtained if the presence of a cooling flow is taken into account .",
    "the luminous cluster pks 0745 - 191 is an excellent example . using x - ray observations from asca and rosat , allen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report that pks 0745 - 191 contains one of the largest known cooling flows , with a mass deposition rate of @xmath15 . from optical observations",
    ", they also report the discovery of a bright arc consistent with gravitational lensing of a galaxy at redshift @xmath16 . using the lensing data , they derive the projected mass of the central part of the cluster , finding good agreement with the corresponding mass obtained from a multiphase analysis of the x - ray data .",
    "they emphasize , however , that a multiphase analysis is required ; their single - phase analysis of the asca data clearly disagrees with their lensing result , yielding a mass which is smaller than the lensing value by a factor of @xmath17 .    in this paper , we present our analysis of high - angular resolution x - ray imaging observations of pks 0745 - 191 using the chandra x - ray observatory . from these data ,",
    "we derive mass estimates and cooling flow mass deposition rates .",
    "x - ray surface brightness and abundance profiles are also presented , along with a map of the projected plasma temperature distribution . in addition",
    ", we compare our high - resolution x - ray image of the cluster core with observations in the optical and radio .    throughout this paper we used @xmath18=50 @xmath19 , @xmath20=1.0 , @xmath21=0.0 , and @xmath22=0.5 .",
    "for pks 0745 - 191 we take the redshift to be @xmath23 , so that the luminosity distance @xmath24 mpc , and @xmath25 corresponds to a linear distance of 2.57 kpc .",
    "pks 0745 - 191 was observed twice using the chandra / hetgs .",
    "the first of these observations , observation i d ( obsid ) 510 , occurred on october 14 , 1999 , when the temperature of the acis focal plane was @xmath26 c. the second observation ( obsid 1509 ) was on march 4 , 2000 at a focal plane temperature of -120 .",
    "there was a 208 degree difference in roll angle between the two observations .",
    "the acis gain was corrected using the most recent calibration files available , taking into account the focal plane temperature of the instrument during each observation .",
    "the aspect solutions were examined for irregularities but none were found .",
    "background contamination due to charged particle flares was reduced by removing time intervals during which the background rate exceeded the average background rate by more than 20% .",
    "the event files were filtered on standard grades and bad pixels were removed using standard cleaning procedures . after filtering , the net remaining exposure times were 44784 seconds and 38999 seconds , respectively .",
    "we fit a two - dimensional elliptical lorentzian to the counts image of each dataset to locate the center of the x - ray emission peak and measure its ellipticity .",
    "the center positions of the two observations differ in declination by @xmath27 , apparently due to an astrometry error in pipeline processing . for this reason ,",
    "our imaging analysis used only the more recently reprocessed observation , obsid 510 .",
    "our spectral analysis is unaffected by the offset .",
    "using obsid 510 , the centroid of the flux corrected x - ray emission lies at ( 07:47:31.3@xmath28 , -19:17:40.0@xmath28 ) ( j2000 ) , the exact coordinates of the cd galaxy .",
    "the axis - ratio is @xmath29 , with the major axis at position angle of @xmath30 , measured counterclockwise on the sky from north .",
    "the zeroth order image is sufficiently extended that it overlaps with events from the dispersed spectra .",
    "this overlap has no effect on the cluster core , becoming signifcant only at a radius of @xmath31 from the center of the zeroth order image .",
    "the cross - dispersion extent of the overlap region was measured by fitting gaussians to the cross - dispersion profiles . to remove the overlap , we excised the region beginning @xmath31 ( 193 kpc ) along the dispersion direction from the cluster center , and extending to approximately 2@xmath32 in the cross - dispersion direction on either side of the axis of the dispersed spectrum . within a radius of @xmath33 ( 360 kpc )",
    "any remaining contamination lies at a very low level and is restricted to energies @xmath34 kev along the meg dispersion direction and @xmath35 kev along the heg dispersion direction .",
    "chandra s unparalleled spatial resolution makes it possible to examine spatial variations in the x - ray emission on much smaller scales than were previously accessible . in this section",
    "we present our analysis of the structure of the inner @xmath2 ( 360 kpc ) of pks 0745 - 191 .",
    "we also discuss a similar analysis of the emission - weighted mean spectrum which may be directly compared with results from lower resolution observations .",
    "spectra were extracted from both data sets in an elliptical region with a @xmath1 ( @xmath0300 kpc ) major axis and an ellipticity of 0.35 , centered on the x - ray emission peak .",
    "these extractions yielded spectra with 56,863 counts and 47,288 counts for obsid 510 and 1509 , respectively .",
    "these spectra were then analyzed with xspec @xcite using response matrice files ( rmfs ) and effective area files ( arfs ) generated from the latest version of the chandra calibration database ( caldb 2.7 ) ; the rmf includes the improved calibration for the low energy response of the aimpoint ccd on acis - s . for all analyses ,",
    "a single rmf was generated at the position of the x - ray centroid and used for analysis of the entire region .",
    "variations in the spectral resolution of the acis - s aimpoint ccd were found to be smaller than 10% within the extraction region ; fits using rmfs taken from other points in the region gave equivalent results within the errors .",
    "variations in the effective area were negligible within the extraction region .",
    "backgrounds were extracted for these observations from the aim point chip ( acis - s3 ) .",
    "the background regions were chosen as far away from the aimpoint as possible and were sized to minimize contamination by diffracted photons .",
    "each spectrum was grouped to contain least 20 counts per bin , and data from the two observations were fit simultaneously .",
    "the spectra were fitted with three models , each including foreground absorption : a single temperature model , a two temperature model , and a single temperature plus cooling flow model .",
    "each of the spectral models were fit twice , once with the absorbing column frozen at its measured value of 4.24 @xmath36 @xcite , and once allowing the absorption to vary .",
    "the cluster redshift was fixed throughout the analysis .",
    "data below 0.5 kev were excluded from the fits due to uncertainties in the acis calibration while energies above 8.0 kev were neglected due to background contamination .",
    "the results of these spectral fits along with 90% confidence ranges , are shown in table-1 .",
    "of the models considered , the best fits were obtained with two temperature mekal and multiphase mkcflow plasma models .",
    "a plot of the fit to the two temperature model is shown in figure-1 .",
    "for this model , we find an ambient cluster temperature of @xmath37 kev , a low temperature component of @xmath38 kev , and an abundance of @xmath39 solar .",
    "the reduced @xmath40 for this fit was 1.02 for 929 degrees of freedom .",
    "these results are consistent with both the @xmath41 asca cooling flow analysis of allen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the @xmath41 bepposax multiphase analysis of pks 0745 - 191 @xcite .",
    "the larger residuals between 1.3 - 2 kev figure-1 appear to be the result of a calibration problem , most likely associated with spatial variations in the rmf combined with interpolation errors on the rather coarse energy grid used in the rmf calibration .",
    "similar residuals are seen in observations of other clusters , generally appearing in cases where spectra have been extracted from a source which spans several of the detector regions where calibration data is specified .",
    "these residuals do not significantly affect our fit results .      to investigate the radial dependence of temperature and abundance in pks 0745 - 191",
    ", spectra were extracted from 12 elliptical annuli spanning the central @xmath42 ( 360 kpc ) of the cluster .",
    "figure-2 shows the spectral extraction regions overlaid on an adaptively smoothed counts image of the cluster .",
    "the extraction regions were sized to ensure at least 3000 counts per spectrum in the 0.29 - 7.0 kev band for each data set .",
    "the extracted spectra were grouped to contain 20 counts per bin and analyzed using xspec .",
    "models were fit to data over the energy range 0.6 - 7.0 kev .",
    "arfs , rmfs , and backgrounds used were the same as described in ",
    "[ ss : spec - analy ] , and data from the two observations were again fit simultaneously at each radius .",
    "the same plasma models described in  [ ss : spec - analy ] were again used to fit the data .",
    "while single temperature spectral models generally fit the data well ( reduced @xmath40 of 0.98 - 1.55 ) , adding a cooler component in fits to the nine innermost spectra ( the central 215 kpc of the cluster ) improved the fits somewhat . outside of that region , the normalization of the low temperature component of the two temperature model was consistent with zero , and single temperature models provided equally good fits to the data .",
    "the cooling flow model did not constrain the temperature outside of the innermost region .    because of large discrepancies in spatial resolution , it is difficult to compare prior work on the spatial structure of pks 0745 - 191 to the results reported in this section",
    ". however , it is worth noting that our results differ in some respects .    in their bepposax analysis",
    ", @xcite ruled out a large temperature gradient in pks 0745 - 191 , but our investigation shows that there is indeed a noticeable gradient present in the central region ( figures 3 & 4 ) .",
    "their work also supports a strong abundance gradient , but we see no indication of such a gradient in the inner 360 kpc ( @xmath2 ) of the cluster .",
    "instead , we find that the abundance remains relatively constant throughout the core ( figure-5 ) , with an average value of @xmath43 solar , consistent with their result for the inner @xmath1 . the results of allen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are also consistent with a constant metal abundance although they favor a somewhat lower value of @xmath44 .      extending the radial analysis discussed above",
    ", we have generated maps of the plasma temperature in the central regions of the cluster .",
    "these maps were computed for both datasets independently using a custom module within the isis @xcite spectral analysis package which automates the process of extracting many pi spectra , generating appropriate arfs and rmfs for each spectrum , and then fitting a given spectral model ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .    in generating the temperature maps , a grid of adaptively sized extraction regions",
    "were selected to contain a minimum of 2000 counts in the 0.3 - 7.0 kev band .",
    "the grid was selected to span a 200x200 arcsec region centered on the cluster peak , consistent with the integrated spectrum analysis described above .",
    "we avoid problems associated with chip edge effects by choosing spectral extraction regions which lie entirely within the edges of the acis - s3 chip .",
    "the extracted spectra were fit with a mekal plasma model including foreground galactic absorption fixed at the nominal value of 4.24 @xmath36 .",
    "the abundance was fixed at a value of 0.5 as determined by the integrated spectral fits .",
    "single - parameter 90% confidence limits were computed for each fit to estimate the level of statistical uncertainty in each pixel of the temperature map .",
    "although the temperature map shown in figure-6 was computed holding the absorbing column and metal abundance fixed , similar results were obtained when the absorbing column and metal abundance were allowed to vary .    the temperature map for the central 100@xmath45x100@xmath45 region of pks 0745 - 191 ( obsid 510 )",
    "is shown in figure-6 .",
    "in general , the resulting temperature structure is consistent with the radial temperature profile presented in figure-3 .",
    "the overall temperature morphology traces the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the region of coolest emission , with temperatures @xmath03 - 4 kev , appears to be centered at a slight offset from the position of the central cd .",
    "however , this scale is comparable to the map resolution in the core and so may be consistent with a zero offset .",
    "finally , we find no evidence for gas cooler than @xmath03 kev consistent with results from other cooling flows observed with chandra and xmm @xcite .",
    "radial surface brightness profiles were computed for each observation . to minimize errors due to the energy - dependence of the effective area , we divided the 0.29 - 7.0 kev bandpass into 12 bands in which the effective area is roughly constant . in each energy band , we extracted a 2048@xmath462048 image of the undispersed zero - order counts .",
    "we also computed a zero - order exposure map for each energy band .",
    "after excising regions affected by contamination from dispersed counts , the surface brightness was computed in elliptical annuli with centroid , position angle and axis - ratio given in  [ s : obs ] .",
    "all quoted radii are measured along the semi - major axis .",
    "the surface brightness profiles from each dataset were mutually consistent within their errors . in each energy band , the surface brightness profiles from each dataset were fit simultaneously , once with a single @xmath4-model and once with a double @xmath4-model .",
    "the single @xmath4-model has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant representing the intensity contribution of the background , @xmath49 is the normalization and @xmath50 is the core radius .",
    "the double @xmath4-model has the form @xmath51 where each component has fit parameters @xmath52 .",
    "table-2 shows the results of fitting a single @xmath4-model to those energy bands which have sufficient signal to noise to constrain the parameters .",
    "although a single @xmath4-model yields a reasonably good fit to the surface brightness profile , it fails to account for a significant excess of emission in the cluster core . adding a second @xmath4 component ( table-3 ) yields a better fit to the surface brightness profile ( figure-7 ) , consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the double @xmath4-model yields the best fit to the 0.29 - 7.0 kev data giving @xmath53 ( at large radius ) , a core radius of @xmath54 kpc , and a background value of 1.4@xmath55 phot @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 , with a reduced @xmath40 of 1.15 for 473 degrees of freedom . although the core radius of our best fitting single @xmath4-model is comparable to the @xmath59 kpc core radius reported by @xcite , the outer core radius of the double @xmath4-model is significantly larger .",
    "we used an unsharp masking technique to examine the substructure in the cluster core . by subtracting a heavily smoothed , flux - corrected image ( @xmath60 ) from an adaptively smoothed , full - resolution image ( @xmath61 )",
    ", we effectively subtract out the smooth , large scale structure leaving residuals associated with smaller - scale inhomogeneities .",
    "a full resolution 400@xmath46400 pixel image centered on the x - ray emission peak was extracted from obsid 510 in the 0.29 - 7.0 kev band .",
    "a matching zero - order exposure map was constructed for the same region .",
    "regions contaminated by dispersed photons were removed from both the image and exposure map and the resulting image was adaptively smoothed using the ciao tool csmooth .",
    "a similar image was smoothed with a gaussian kernel of 20 pixel ( @xmath62 ) fwhm .",
    "each of the two resulting images was divided by the exposure map and exposure time , to produce flux - corrected images .",
    "the residual image , ( @xmath63 ) , with hardness contour overlays is shown in figure-8 .",
    "substructure is clearly present in the core of pks 0745 , with excess emission covering an elongated area of about 100 kpc @xmath46 50 kpc .",
    "the brightest point in this image lies directly on the cd galaxy at the center of the cluster , and has a surface brightness which is 68% of the adaptively smoothed surface brightness at that point .",
    "similar images were made in a hard band ( @xmath64 : 2.0 - 7.0 kev ) and a soft band ( @xmath65 : 0.29 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "these images showed no appreciable difference in the morphology of the core substructure , although the relatively low signal to noise ratio is not sensitive to weak temperature variations",
    ".      images with the same specifications as those mentioned in  [ ss : imag - substr ] were made of both the hard band ( @xmath64 ) and the soft band ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "these images were smoothed using the smoothing scale produced in the analysis of the full energy band ( 0.29 - 7.0 kev ) .",
    "using exposure maps calculated for the individual bands , and following the procedure detailed in  [ ss : imag - substr ] , smoothed , flux - corrected images were constructed . using these flux - corrected images @xmath66 and @xmath60 , we constructed a hardness map ( @xmath67 ) , defined as @xmath68 contours of the resulting hardness ratio image ( @xmath67 ) are overlayed on the core residuals map of figure-8 .",
    "although the hardness contours are less elongated than the residuals image , ellipticity is clearly present .",
    "soft emission is peaked in two places , neither of which corresponds exactly to the position of the cd , although the more central of the soft emission peaks lies within @xmath27 of it .",
    "the adaptively smoothed core image ( @xmath61 ) from  [ ss : imag - substr ] was used to construct a set of ten x - ray isophotes , spaced logarithmically over a range in surface brightness from 2.2@xmath55 to 1.8@xmath69 .",
    "figure-9 shows these contours overlaid on an hst optical image of pks 0745 - 191 obtained from the hst archive .",

    "an anti - correlation between x - ray and radio morphology has been seen in some nearby clusters of galaxies @xcite , but these data do not clearly show this effect .",
    "the brightest of the gravitiational arcs of pks 0745 - 191 can be seen in the optical image as a faint streak directly to the right of the cluster .",
    "there seems to be no apparent connection between the x - ray emission and the arcs .",

    "x - ray spectral fits determine both plasma temperature and , via the emission measure , the central density .",
    "spectra were extracted from an elliptical aperture with a 0.5 mpc major axis , which was centered on the x - ray emission peak .",

    "they derive somewhat longer cooling times of 1.95@xmath85 and 1.11@xmath85 years , respectively .",
    "however , their analysis assumed an ambient cluster temperature of 10 kev , and the size of the central bins from which they extract cooling times are relatively large : @xmath86 for the pspc , and @xmath3 for the hri . given that our results are roughly consistent at a radius of 200 kpc , the detailed differences probably arise from a combination of the @xmath02 kev temperature difference and the difference in the bin size .",

    "@xcite investigated the accuracy of mass estimates based on the @xmath4-model using a large number of cosmological gas - dynamic simulations of cluster formation and evolution .",

    ", the region inside a 0.5 mpc radius has a mean density of @xmath91 , placing it within the hydrostatic region commonly seen in cluster evolution simulations .    using his simulations",
    ", @xcite also found that the presence of a temperature gradient has a relatively small effect on the mass determination .",
    "after including the known 3d temperature gradient from the simulated clusters , the corresponding mass estimates for regions with @xmath92 changed by less than 1 standard deviation .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion obtained by comparing the sizes of the temperature and density gradients in equation ( [ hydrostat ] ) .",
    "both the single - temperature fits and the hotter component of the two - temperature fits give a temperature gradient of about @xmath93 at a radius of 200 kpc .",
    "for comparison , the @xmath4-model indicates a gas - density gradient of @xmath94 at the same radius .",
    "therefore , in estimating the total mass within this radius , the temperature gradient is at most a 25% effect .",
    "a somewhat larger source of uncertainty arises from the cluster s elliptical shape . although the morphology may be more complex",
    ", we can estimate the uncertainty due to projection effects by computing the gas mass for oblate and prolate mass distributions suitably oriented and normalized so that the surface brightness and axis - ratio matches the observations .",
    "for an axis - ratio of 0.6 , the estimated gas mass could vary by as much as @xmath050% depending on the geometry , although the extremes of this range require coincidental alignment , making them less likely .",
    "we have presented our analysis of chandra observations of the galaxy cluster pks 0745 - 191 .",
    "these data provide a much clearer picture of the x - ray structure of the central 300 kpc .",
    "the spectra are not well fit by a single temperature model , because of excess soft emission from the core .",
    "the cluster - integrated spectrum is best fit by a two - temperature model with temperatures of @xmath37 kev and @xmath38 kev , with an abundance of @xmath39 solar .",
    "consistent with results from other chandra observations of cooling flows , we see no evidence for x - ray emission from cooling gas with temperatures below @xmath95 kev @xcite .    chandra s excellent angular resolution has allowed us to study the distribution of both metallicity and temperature on very small scales ( @xmath020 kpc ) in the inner 360 kpc of pks 0745 - 191 .",
    "using single temperature spectral models we find an ostensibly constant abundance with a value of @xmath00.5 solar , and a steep temperature gradient within the innermost 215 kpc .",
    "imaging analysis of the cluster core reveals enhanced x - ray emission from an elongated region in the core of about 100 kpc @xmath46 50 kpc .",
    "the hardness ratio map shows a somewhat larger region ( r @xmath96 50 kpc ) of excess soft emission ( 0.29 - 2.0 kev ) in the core .",
    "comparison of the x - ray data to optical ( hst ) and radio ( vla ) observations of pks 0745 - 191 places the x - ray emission peak within @xmath5 of both the optical and radio central cd positions .",
    "the surface brightness profile is best fit by a double @xmath4-model with an outer core radius of 51.42 kpc and @xmath4 value of 0.49 .",
    "the central density is @xmath97 .",
    "the central cooling time based on a multi - phase cooling flow model is 8.67@xmath82 yr , with a corresponding cooling radius of 104 kpc .",
    "we found best agreement between the x - ray and spherical gravitational lensing masses using a multiphase spectral model for which we obtained a mass of 2.9@xmath98 .",
    "single temperature models imply masses consistently smaller than lensing mass estimates .",
    "mass results stemming from two temperature models , though smaller than spherical lensing estimates , are consistent with elliptically derived values . in any case , our x - ray spectra require no more than two temperature components and , in particular , do not require a multiphase treatment of the sort emphasized by allen et al .",
    "although the physics of cooling gas strongly suggests that a multiphase medium should be present , our data do not require it .",
