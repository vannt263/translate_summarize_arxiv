    ", scaledwidth=46.0% ]    we next discuss the caustics pattern of the case where the source tip is placed on an eccentric position in the transverse direction ; see fig .",
    "[ ldoseccentric ] . in the armchair case , the caustics pattern within the caustics curves ( see the white dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ ldoseccentric ] ) is just shifted along the change of the tip position without any deformation . in contrast , the pattern is deformed into an asymmetric shape in the zigzag case .",
    "hence , the difference of the caustics pattern between the armchair and zigzag cases is more pronounced , so it may be useful for detecting the pancharatnam - berry phase .",
    "the reason of the asymmetric pattern in the zigzag case is as follows .",
    "when the tip position moves from the center line of @xmath48 into @xmath212 , electron trajectories injected from the tip become asymmetric such that some trajectories propagating into the lower edge undergo edge reflection twice before the converge to the focal point , while their symmetry partners with respect to the @xmath211 line , moving into the upper edge , do not meet the edge .",
    "then , the trajectories downward with the edge reflections have phase shift by the pancharatnam - berry geometric phase , while those upward have no phase shift .",
    "this makes the caustics pattern asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetric pattern is a direct signature of the geometric phase .",
    "we note that under the edge reconstruction or the staggered potential , the caustics pattern of a zigzag nanoribbon remains asymmetric ( hence , still in sharp contrast to an armchair nanoribbon ) when the tip is on an eccentric point ; we obtained numerical results for this case , but do not present them in this paper .",
    "therefore , the caustics pattern provides a tool for detecting the geometric phase .",
    "in summary , we predict that pancharatnam - berry geometric phase appears in the reflection phase of dirac fermions at graphene edge . the geometric phase is originated from the rotation of pseudospin in the edge reflection .",
    "it depends on edge chirality , the injection angle of dirac fermions into edge , and the detailed edge situation such as edge reconstruction and staggered potential .",
    "it is finite in general at zigzag edge , while it always vanishes at armchair edge . as physical manifestation of the geometric phase ,",
    "we discuss the electronic structure and the energy band gap of graphene nanoribbon .",
    "the quantization rule of the transverse mode of the nanoribbon is modified by the geometric phase . and",
    ", we also discuss the caustics pattern in a veselago lens formed in a graphene nanoribbon .",
    "the shape of the pattern is different between an armchair nanoribbon and a zigzag nanoribbon , and provides a direct signature of the geometric phase .",
    "our finding reveals the topological aspect of scattering of dirac fermions at graphene edge .",
    "it can be detected in a resonance or interference setup , as we have discussed the quantization rule and the caustics pattern in a nanoribbon .",
