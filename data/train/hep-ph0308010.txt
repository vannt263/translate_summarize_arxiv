    "neutrino nucleus scattering will be an important tool in future long baseline ( lbl ) experiments to precisely measure neutrino parameters like neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "these experiments will use neutrino beams with energies of the order @xmath1 where quasi - elastic reactions ( qe ) , single pion resonance production ( res ) and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) are all important .",
    "moreover , due to the small neutrino cross sections heavy targets like oxygen , argon or iron have to be used .    in the following",
    "we will deal with single pion resonance production , i.e. , with the reactions @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a nuclear target ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 a final nuclear state .    at this stage",
    "we make the basic assumption that the reaction can be described by two _ independent _ steps @xcite :    *   + in this first step a pion is produced by the scattering of the incoming neutrino off a nucleon in the target , such that nuclear corrections due to the pauli principle and the fermi motion of the nucleons should be taken into account . *   + once the pion has been produced it will travel through the nucleus . during this journey",
    "the pion can have several rescatterings in which it can change its charge or be absorbed .",
    "step 2 can be described by a @xmath6 charge exchange matrix @xmath7 which depends only on the properties of the target [ modeled by a charge density profile @xmath8 but which is independent of the identities of the leptons in step 1 .",
    "it should be noted that the above assumption of two independent steps generates predictive power , since the formalism can be applied to charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) neutrino- and electroproduction of pions in the resonance region .",
    "absorbing the pauli suppression factor of step 1 into the normalization of @xmath7 , the measurable final distributions ( cross sections ) of pions @xmath9 can be related to the initial distributions @xmath10 for a _ free _ target in the simple form @xmath11 with @xmath12 where the free nucleon cross sections are averaged over the fermi momentum of the nucleons . the matrix @xmath7 depends on the target material and the final state kinematic variables , i.e.  @xmath13 $ ] . in the following",
    "we will restrict the discussion to isoscalar targets and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for targets with a neutron excess .",
    "the charge exchange matrix @xmath7 for isoscalar targets can be parameterized by three independent parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 : @xmath17 so far there is no direct experimental information on these three parameters available .",
    "on the other hand a model for pion multiple scattering by adler , nussinov and paschos ( anp model ) @xcite allows to calculate these parameters and ( averaged ) charge exchange matrices for oxygen , argon and iron targets can be found in @xcite .",
    "these matrices are useful to calculate cc and nc single pion production in the ( 3,3 ) resonance region induced by neutrinos @xcite and electrons @xcite and the rescattering effects are predicted to be quite large .",
    "for example , the pion energy spectra for @xmath18 s produced on oxygen targets in nc neutrino production will be reduced by up to @xmath19 whereas the analogous spectra for the charged pions remain almost unchanged compared to the free nucleon cross sections @xcite .",
    "similar results are predicted for the @xmath20-distributions for 1-pion resonance production in electron - oxygen scattering @xcite . for the @xmath18",
    "the @xmath20-distribution will be reduced by about @xmath21 while the production of @xmath22 remains almost unchanged compared to the free case since the decrease due to absorption is widely compensated by an increase due to charge exchange .",
    "this marked signal of rescattering effects should be easily testable in low energy electron scattering experiments , for example at jlab .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give an introduction to the anp model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : norm ] we discuss the normalization of pion absorption which we fix by experimental information . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] we discuss the dynamics of the anp model in more detail . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize the main results .",
    "in this section we introduce the multiple scattering model by adler , nussinov and paschos @xcite . due to space limitations",
    "the presentation will be short and we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion of the omitted details .",
    "the main ingredients of the model are as follows : ( i ) the target nucleus is taken to be a collection of independent nucleons distributed spatially according to a charge density profile @xmath23 .",
    "( ii ) the nucleons are regarded to be fixed within the nucleus neglecting fermi motion and nucleon recoil effects .",
    "this implies that the pion energy @xmath24 does not change in the elastic scatterings .",
    "furthermore the target is assumed to stay isotopically neutral ( @xmath25 ) during the multiple scattering processes .",
    "( iii ) the pion interactions in the nucleus are assumed to be incoherent @xmath26 reactions taking place in the @xmath27 resonance region .",
    "since pion production and more complex channels are closed in this region the rescattering processes can be described by two cross sections , the pion absorption cross section per nucleon @xmath28 and the usual elastic @xmath26 cross sections .",
    "the relevant @xmath26 reactions read @xmath29 ( iv ) in the @xmath27 resonance region the @xmath26 cross section is dominated by the isospin @xmath30 amplitude such that all elastic cross sections are related to @xmath31 by clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the initial multiplicity distribution of pions in the medium ( with fixed pion energy ) .",
    "in a single elastic scattering this distribution will be modified to a final distribution @xmath33 : @xmath34 with a known @xmath6 matrix @xmath35 @xcite which follows easily from a clebsch - gordan analysis of isospin .    accordingly , taking into account all possible multiple scatterings",
    "the final pion charge distribution is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability that the pion exits the nucleus after exactly @xmath38 @xmath26 scatterings .",
    "it should be noted that the matrix @xmath35 does not include any absorption which is taken into account by @xmath39 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath35 are given by @xmath40 and one finds immediately the three eigenvalues of the charge exchange matrix @xmath7 in dependence of the three eigenvalues @xmath41 of @xmath35 @xmath42    the connection between the eigenbasis and the canonical basis is given by @xmath43 or inversely @xmath44 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as already mentioned in the introduction , the pauli suppression factor of step 1 will be conveniently absorbed into the normalization of the charge exchange matrix @xmath7 @xmath45 the function @xmath46 contains the dynamical details of pion multiple scattering in the nucleus .",
    "an outline of how this function is calculated by solving a transport problem for pions in the nucleus will be given in the next section .",
    "to a very good approximation @xcite the three - dimensional problem can be reduced to a one - dimensional transport problem by projecting the forward - hemisphere of the scattered pion onto the forward direction and the backward - hemisphere onto the backward direction [ see eq .  ] . in this approximation",
    "the pion scatters back and forth along its initial direction of motion until it is absorbed or leaves the nucleus . as is explained in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite the nucleon density profile along the scattering line can be scaled out of the problem by an appropriate change in length variable such that it is equivalent to consider a _ uniform _",
    "one - dimensional nuclear medium extending from @xmath48 to @xmath49 with effective length ( optical thickness ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the impact parameter .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the discussion we only consider forward scattering of the pions ( and also neglect pauli suppression in this step 2 ) . the solutions taking into account forward and backward scattering , @xmath52 , can be found in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "apart from being more realistic , they are important for estimates of the background to proton decay by neutrino production of pions in the @xmath27 resonance region @xcite .",
    "the transport process can be described in terms of the basic probabilities for a pion density to propagate from @xmath53 to @xmath54 and to a ) interact ( scattering or absorption ) b ) scatter c ) be absorbed in @xmath55 $ ] @xmath56 with @xmath57 ( inverse interaction length ) , @xmath58 being the probability that the pion is scattered and @xmath59 the probability that the pion is absorbed ( in a single scattering process ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath60 as density of the uniform one - dimensional medium ( i.e. @xmath61 ) is related to the normalization of the effective length in eq .  .",

    "the cross sections for charge exchange ( cex ) and absorption ( abs ) will be specified below .",

    "and we have omitted for simplicity a possible pauli suppression factor taking into account the pauli exclusion principle in step 2 .",
    "note also , that it is debatable whether such a factor should be included here since we are working in a picture with fixed nucleons .",
    "\\(iii ) the third ingredient is the cross section per nucleon for pion absorption , @xmath28 . for this quantity sternheim and silbar",

    "the dynamical functions ( the charge exchange matrix ) are mainly sensitive to the region around @xmath117 and thus mainly sensitive to the _ normalization _ of @xmath118 .    in the following we fix this normalization by using experimental data for 1-pion production in cc @xmath119-deuteron [ @xmath120 free case ] and @xmath119-neon scattering .",
