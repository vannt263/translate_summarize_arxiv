    "the scenario where our world is associated with a brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime with non - factorizable geometry has attracted a lot of interest with the aim of solving several open questions in modern physics ( see@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the braneworld models assume that all matter fields are localized on the brane , whereas gravity can propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "recently we investigated the standing wave braneworld model in 5d spacetime @xcite and had shown that it provides universal gravitational trapping of zero modes of all kinds of matter fields in the case of rapid oscillations of standing waves in the bulk .",
    "the goal of this article is to generalize the model to 6d spacetime .",
    "although there exist a vast literature concerned to the localization of fields in 6d braneworld , there is not yet found a universal trapping mechanism for all fields . in the existing 6d models with stationary",
    "exponentially warped spacetimes spin-@xmath0 , spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath3 fields are localized on the brane with the decreasing warp factor , but spin-@xmath2 fields can be localized only with the increasing warp factor@xcite .",
    "there exist also 6d models with non - exponential warp factors providing gravitational localization of all kinds of bulk fields on the brane@xcite , however , these models require introduction of unnatural gravitational sources",
    ". there have been also considered models with time - dependent metrics and fields@xcite .    here",
    "we introduce the non - stationary 6d braneworld model with gravity coupled to a phantom - like scalar field in the bulk , where generated bulk standing waves are bounded by the brane at the 2d extra space origin and the static part of the gravitational potential increasing at the extra space infinity .",
    "then we explicitly show that this model provides universal gravitational trapping of zero modes of all kinds of matter fields in the case of rapid oscillations of bulk standing waves .",
    "it must be mentioned that analogous physical setup was considered in recent paper @xcite , which differs from our model in metric ansatz .    in the article in section 2",
    "we introduce the background solution of our model and some expressions for using in subsequent sections .",
    "then , in sections 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 we demonstrate existence of normalizable zero modes of spin-@xmath0 , -@xmath1 , -@xmath2 and -@xmath3 particles on the brane .",
    "short final conclusions can be found in section 7 .",
    "in 6d spacetime the einstein equations with a bulk cosmological constant @xmath4 and stress - energy tensor @xmath5 are @xmath6 where capital latin indices refer to 6d spacetime and 6d gravitational constant @xmath7 obeys the relation @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the 6d newton constant and the 6d planck mass scale , respectively ) .",
    "for the two extra spatial dimensions we introduce polar coordinates ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in our physical setup there exists non - self - interacting phantom - like real scalar field propagating in the bulk and having the following energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 using , equations can be rewritten in the form @xmath16 we look for the metric in the form    @xmath17 - d{r^2 } - r_0 ^ 2{e^{2ar - 3u\\left ( { t , r } \\right)}}d{\\theta ^2},\\ ] ]    where curvature scale @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants , and the function @xmath20 depends only on time @xmath21 and on extra radial polar coordinate @xmath11 . then @xmath22 this metric _ ansatz _ coincides with the known solution @xcite , that describes the model with a @xmath23-brane at the origin @xmath24 which is a 4d local string - like topological defect in the 6d spacetime .",
    "we also mention that the metric _ ansatz _ differs from that recently proposed in the article @xcite , our metric symmetrically considers @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 coordinates .",
    "taking into account symmetry properties of the metric _ ansatz _ , we assume that phantom - like scalar field depends only on time @xmath21 and extra coordinate @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath28 . after a straightforward calculation , equations reduce to    @xmath29    from which we get @xmath30    first equation in system fixes relation between bulk cosmological constant @xmath4 and the curvature scale @xmath31 in the exponential warp factor of the metric .",
    "we see that the bulk cosmological constant @xmath4 must be negative .    taking into account the second and the third equations in",
    ", we set the relation between metric function @xmath32 and phantom - like scalar field @xmath33 as    @xmath34    now we return to the last equation in and , using separation of variables @xmath35 , decouple it as follows @xmath36 where where @xmath37 is some real constant and overdots and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the solution to the first equation in is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are some real constants . to solve the second equation in we perform the following change of variables @xmath41 and it gets the form @xmath42 with the solution @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some real constants , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48-order bessel functions of first and second kind respectively . taking into account change of variables , for @xmath49",
    "we get @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are some real constants .    imposing on @xmath53 the following boundary condition at the extra space infinity @xmath54 and taking the case of increasing warp factor , i.e. @xmath55 , from and we get @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some real constant .    the ghost - like field @xmath59 and the metric oscillations via the metric oscillatory function @xmath53 must be unobservable on the brane located at @xmath24 in the extra space . according to , and we can fulfil the requirement by imposing the boundary condition on the bessel function @xmath60 taking into account the oscillatory character of the bessel function @xmath61 and denoting by @xmath62 its @xmath63-th zero",
    ", this condition can be written in the form @xmath64 which quantizes the standing wave oscillation frequency @xmath65 in terms or curvature scale @xmath31 . choosing some value of @xmath63 in",
    ", the function @xmath66 gets the form @xmath67 and it s easy to see that in the 2d extra space we will have @xmath68 concentric circles ( all of them sharing the same center coinciding with the 2d extra space origin ) where the oscillatory function @xmath69 vanishes .",
    "the radiuses @xmath70 of these circles satisfy the relation @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "these circles are the nodes of the circular standing wave in the 2d extra space and can be considered as the circular islands where matter particles can be bound .",
    "it s obvious that the metric function @xmath53 and scalar field @xmath59 also vanish at the circles . in what follows in",
    "we assume n=1 , i.e. we choose the first zero of the function @xmath61 @xmath73 in this case circular standing wave has only two nodes in the extra space : at the origin @xmath24 and at the infinity @xmath74 .    in the subsequent sections we investigate various matter field equations .",
    "the metric oscillatory function enters the equations via exponents @xmath75 , with @xmath76 denoting some real constant . to solve the localization problem",
    "we assume that the standing wave frequency @xmath65 is much larger than the frequencies corresponding to the energies of the particles localized on the string - like brane , and in the matter field equations we perform time averaging of the oscillating exponents . denoting the time average @xmath77 by @xmath78 and using the results of our previous papers @xcite , we can write the following useful expressions @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the modified bessel function of order zero and the function @xmath66 is defined by with @xmath81 . in what follows we also use the asymptotic expansions of the function @xmath82 at the origin and infinity in the extra space    @xmath83}^2}}}{{2\\pi { z_1}}}\\,\\,{a^2}{r^2 } + o\\left ( { { a^3}{r^3 } } \\right),\\\\ { \\left . { { k_b}\\left ( r \\right ) } \\right|_{r \\to   + \\infty } } & = & 1 + \\frac{{{b^2}{b_0}^2{z_1}^5}}{{450\\pi } } \\,\\,{e^ { - 10ar } } + o\\left ( { { e^ { - 12ar } } } \\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath84 defined by .",

    "figure 1 shows behaviour of @xmath109 .",
    "we explore ( [ sf - equation - varsigma ] ) in two limiting regions , far from and close to the brane . using ,",
    "far from the brane , i.e. @xmath110 , the equation ( [ sf - equation - varsigma ] ) obtains the form @xmath111{\\sigma _ 0 } = 0~,\\ ] ] with the general solution @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are some constants .",
    "taking into account , the extra dimension factor @xmath115 of the scalar field gets the following form @xmath116 to have normalizable zero mode , at the infinity we impose the boundary condition @xmath117 so we set @xmath118 in and get the following result    @xmath119    taking into account , close to the brane , @xmath120 , the equation again reduces to .",
    "resemblance of the equations far from and close to the brane is not surprising since according to the second term of @xmath121 in vanishes in both regions ( these two regions correspond to the nodes of the standing waves ) .",
    "therefore for the extra dimension factor @xmath115 of the scalar field zero mode we again get    @xmath122    where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are some constants . at the origin @xmath24",
    "we impose boundary condition    @xmath125    and get the following result @xmath126    so @xmath115 has a maximum on the brane and falls off at the infinity as @xmath127 . in the scalar field action the determinant and the metric tensor with upper indices give the total exponential factor @xmath128 , which obviously increases for @xmath129 .",
    "but the extra part of wave function contains the exponentially decreasing factor @xmath127 .",
    "so , for such extra dimension factor the integral over @xmath11 in the action is convergent , i.e. 4d scalar fields are localized on the brane .",
    "for simplicity we consider only the @xmath130 vector field , the generalization to the case of non - abelian gauge fields is straightforward . the action of vector field is : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the 6d vector field tensor , and the determinant @xmath133 of the metric is defined by .",
    "the action ( [ vectoraction ] ) gives the system of six equations @xmath134 which for our metric have the following explicit form    @xmath135    we look for the solution to the system ( [ vectorfieldequations1 ] ) in the form : @xmath136 where index @xmath7 runs @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath137 is the oscillatory metric function , and @xmath138 denote the components of 4d vector potential ( greek letters are used for 4d indices ) that obey 4d lorenz - like gauge condition @xmath139 ( @xmath140 denote the metric of 4d minkowski spacetime ) .",
    "in fact , equation together with the last expression in can be considered as the full set of gauge conditions imposed on the vector field @xmath141 .    in the case",
    "when the frequencies of bulk standing waves @xmath65 is much larger than frequencies associated with the energies of the particles on the brane , @xmath142 we assume the existence of localized flat 4d vector waves , @xmath143 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 are components of energy - momentum along the brane .",
    "so putting into and performing time averaging we get the following system of equations    @xmath144    where in index @xmath145 runs values @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the functions @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath146 are time averages defined by . for the @xmath147-wave ( @xmath103 )",
    "zero mode wave function this system reduces to    @xmath148    with @xmath149 . according to and we set @xmath150 and @xmath151 , then equations and reduce to the following single equation @xmath152 so the zero mode solution has the following 6d form @xmath153 where 4d factors @xmath154 have form defined by , and the function @xmath155 obeys the equation .    by making the change @xmath156 we rewrite into the form of non - relativistic quantum mechanical problem @xmath157{\\upsilon _ 0 } = 0~,\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath158 differs from the analogous potential for scalar fields ( see figure 1 ) only in constant factor in the first term .",
    "so , using the same arguments as in the previous section , the solutions to in the two limiting regions - far from and close to the brane - are @xmath159 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are again some constants . taking into account and imposing boundary conditions analogues to and , the extra dimension factor @xmath155 of the vector field zero mode will have the following asymptotic forms @xmath160    so @xmath161 has maximum on the brane and falls off at the infinity as @xmath162 .",
    "now , using and , it s easy to find the time - averaged components of the zero mode tensor @xmath163 where @xmath164 and small latin indexes @xmath145 and @xmath7 run values @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly the 6d lagrangian for zero mode is    @xmath165~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using and , it s straightforward to show that on the brane , @xmath24 , the lagrangian has standard 4d form    @xmath166    and far from the brane , @xmath167 , it has the following asymptotic form @xmath168 so , the integral over extra coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the action is convergent , what means that 4d vector fields are localized on the brane .",
    "the purpose of this section is to explicitly show that there exists normalizable zero mode of the spin @xmath2 fermionic field .",
    "the starting action is the dirac action @xmath169 from which the equation of motion is @xmath170 we introduce the vielbein through the conventional definition : @xmath171 where @xmath172 , refer to 6d local lorentz ( tangent ) frame . using the relation @xmath173 with @xmath174 and @xmath175 being the curved gamma matrices and the flat gamma ones , respectively",
    ", we have relations @xmath176 where the index @xmath145 runs values @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the covariant derivatives in and are @xmath177 with @xmath178 being spin - connections .",
    "the nonvanishing spin - connection components for our background metric are @xmath179 taking into account these results the dirac equation can be written as    @xmath180    we look for solutions of the form @xmath181 where @xmath182 satisfies the massless 4d dirac equation @xmath183 . using , for the @xmath147-wave ( @xmath103 ) zero mode fermionic wave function dirac equation reduces to    @xmath184    as in previous sections , we explore ( [ ff - diracequation - zeromode ] ) in the two limiting regions : far from ( @xmath185 ) and close to ( @xmath186 ) the brane .",
    "taking into account , in both regions the equation reduces to @xmath187 so , the solution in these to regions has forms @xmath188 with @xmath113 and @xmath114 being some real constants .",
    "then , using and , in these regions the zero mode time - averaged lagrangian @xmath189 has the following forms @xmath190 on the brane the 6d lagrangian has the standard 4d form , and the integral over extra coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 in in the action is convergent .",
    "so the 4d fermions are localized on the brane .",
    "for spin 2 gravitons we consider the following metric fluctuations @xmath191 where @xmath192 it is straightforward to show that equations of motion of the fluctuations @xmath193 are @xmath194 these equations of motion for the fluctuations in the present background are equivalent to that of scalar field considered in sec .",
    "3 . accordingly ,",
    "the localization problems for spin 2 graviton and scalar field are similar , and gravitons are also localized on the brane .",
    "in the article we have introduced new nonstationary 6d standing wave braneworld model generated by gravity coupled to a phantom - like scalar field and have explicitly shown that spin @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 fields are localized on the brane by the universal and purely gravitational trapping mechanism . in our model , as opposed to earlier static approaches with decreasing warp factors @xcite , localization takes place in the case of increasing warp factor .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in the article we have considered the model for @xmath195 , where @xmath84 is the first zero of the bessel function @xmath61 . but according to condition there is possibility to control the number of circular islands in the 2d extra space that can provide interesting approach to the old problem - the nature of flavor .",
