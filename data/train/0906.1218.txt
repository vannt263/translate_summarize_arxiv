    "complexifications in various forms have been considered for some time in many different fields , as in for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the central problem is usually to understand the relation between the complexified object and its real counter part . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the relation between morse functions and their complex versions , lefschetz fibrations .",
    "historically , morse functions have of course played a central role in elucidating the differential topology of manifolds . on the other hand ,",
    "lefschetz fibrations played a large role in the study of the topology of algebraic varieties .",
    "they have a formally similar definition to morse functions ( they are proper holomorphic maps on complex analytic varieties with generic singularities modeled on @xmath12 ) , but they are in fact quite different in flavour .",
    "the most obvious difference one can point to is that morse functions have regular level sets which differ in topological type , whereas all the regular fibers of a lefschetz fibrations are diffeomorphic .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite for surveys of morse theory and the theory of lefschetz fibrations . )",
    "+ here is one way to complexify a morse function to get a lefschetz fibration .",
    "( actually , the method we now present is somewhat naive , see remark [ pivsfc ] , but it serves as a useful starting point . )",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a real analytic manifold and @xmath13 is a real analytic morse function .",
    "then , in local charts on @xmath0 , @xmath3 is represented by some convergent power series with real coefficients ; if we complexify these local power series to get complex analytic power series ( with the same coefficients ) we obtain a complex analytic map on the disk bundle of @xmath14 of some small radius @xmath15 , @xmath16 called the _ complexification _ of @xmath3 .",
    "in favorable circumstances , @xmath17 can be regarded as a lefschetz fibration .",
    "( the main issue which may prevent @xmath18 from being a lefschetz fibration is that parts of some fibers may be `` missing '' ; this will happen if the parallel transport vector - field between regular fibers is _",
    "incomplete_. see remark [ pivsfc ] for more on this . ) actually , we want to think of @xmath18 as a symplectic lefschetz fibration , which is an extension of the notion to the symplectic category due to donaldson ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are some slightly different possible definitions and we follow the one in @xcite ( which also satisfies the definition in @xcite ) ; this is designed for work in the category of exact symplectic manifolds ( with nonempty boundary ) .",
    "roughly , a symplectic lefschetz fibration @xmath2 is a fiber bundle with symplectic fibers , but with some isolated singular points modeled on @xmath12 .",
    "+ it is natural to ask : _ to what extent can the complex topology of @xmath18 be described in terms of the morse theory of @xmath3 ? _ the central problem here is to analyze the picard - lefschetz theory of @xmath18 , and we are particularly interested the symplectic view point ( as opposed to classical topology , which deals with cycles ) :    [ complexify]describe the generic fiber of @xmath18 as a symplectic manifold @xmath6 , and describe its vanishing cycles as lagrangian spheres in @xmath6 .",
    "basically this entails reconstructing the picture of the regular complex fiber @xmath6 starting only with knowledge of the morse theory on the real part @xmath19 .",
    "this problem is very natural from the point of view of singularity theory , and indeed our approach is greatly influenced by work of acampo @xcite which treats the case where @xmath3 is a real polynomial on @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the same polynomial on @xmath22 .",
    "+ in our approach we first take a riemannian metric @xmath23 such that @xmath24 is morse - smale and we only assume @xmath25 is smooth , not necessarily real analytic . given the corresponding handle decomposition of @xmath0 , we construct an exact symplectic manifold @xmath6 of dimension @xmath26 together with some exact lagrangian spheres @xmath27 one for each critical point of @xmath3 .",

    ". thus the question of whether @xmath34 and @xmath35 is not pressing for the moment ; still this question remains an interesting one and we intend to pursue it in future work , see remark [ pivsfc ] below for more on that .",

    "theorem @xmath31 appears below as theorem [ main ] . as a step towards proving @xmath34",
    ", we also give a fairly detailed sketch that @xmath10 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath0 in proposition [ prophomotopyequiv ] .",

    "the main point of theorem @xmath31 is the construction of the exact lagrangian embedding @xmath46 .",
    "the other conditions on @xmath0 are rather natural , and in fact their main use here is to guide the construction of @xmath46 . the hypotheses on @xmath3 ensure that the contruction of @xmath6 is relatively easy . in a sequel paper , to appear later , we will give a detailed treatment of the construction of @xmath6 in general , which is more complicated .",
    "( see  [ mgeneral ] of this paper for a partial sketch of that . )",
    "the proof of theorem @xmath31 will then carry over easily to the general case .",
    "( indeed , even in this paper our proof of theorem @xmath31 focuses first on the case where @xmath3 has just three morse indices ( see  [ basics]-[constructionn ] ) .",
    "then we explain how the proof carries over easily to the case where @xmath3 has four morse indices in ",
    "[ 3-manifolds ] . )",
    "later , we will also flesh out the ideas relating @xmath33 and @xmath32 sketched in remark [ pivsfc ] below . for",
    "more about the contents and organization of this paper , see  [ overview ] below .",
    "[ pivsfc ] the precise relationship of @xmath41 to @xmath18 is not so obvious , first , because @xmath41 apparently depends on the metric @xmath23 whereas @xmath18 does not , and second , because @xmath41 can arise from non - analytic data @xmath24 , whereas @xmath18 must have an analytic datum @xmath3 . finally , and most importantly , @xmath18 is not really a lefschetz fibration in the strict sense if one constructs it in the naive way we described .",
    "the reason is the regular fibers of @xmath18 are not going to be diffeomorphic .",
    "indeed , for a given real regular value @xmath47 , the complex level set @xmath48 will be symplectomorphic to @xmath49 , which is the disk cotangent bundle of the corresponding real level set @xmath50 .",
    "but this fiber is much too small : if @xmath18 was a lefschetz fibration with _",
    "complete _ parallel transport vector fields ( where the connection is given by the symplectic orthogonal to the fibers ) , then all the regular fibers would be symplectomorphic , hence each regular fiber should contain _ all _ the real regular level sets of @xmath3 as lagrangian submanifolds ( because we could parallel transport all these lagrangian submanifolds into any fixed regular fiber ) .",
    "one can think of @xmath2 as a larger ( genuine ) lefschetz fibration which does have this property .",
    "we conjecture that the correct picture relating @xmath51 and @xmath33 is that @xmath52 embeds into @xmath10 as a kind of diagonal subset intersecting each regular fiber @xmath53 , @xmath47 , in a weinstein neighborhood of the real level set @xmath50 , as we said before",
    ". then @xmath10 should be conformally exact symplectomorphic to @xmath52 by a retraction along a liouville type vector field ( namely , a variably re - scaled version of the symplectic lift of @xmath54 from the real line ) , and @xmath55 should be deformation equivalent to @xmath18 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to prove theorem @xmath31 , see theorem [ main ] below .",
    "there are three steps in the proof .",
    "first , in  [ fiber ] , we construct the regular fiber @xmath6 and vanishing spheres @xmath30 .",
    "( the construction is based on some techniques explained in ",
    "[ morsebott ] . )",
    "second , in ",
    "[ basics]-[computingvc ] , we construct a symplectic lefschetz fibration @xmath56 with this regular fiber and these vanishing spheres .",
    "( see  [ esketch ] to see why this construction is not immediate . )",
    "third , in  [ constructionn ] , we construct an exact lagrangian embedding @xmath46 satisfying the conditions in theorem @xmath31 .",
    "( see  [ nsketch ] for a sketch . )",
    "+ once the construction of @xmath46 is carried out in detail in one particular case , it is straight - forward to see how it works in any other case . for this reason we first concentrate on the case where @xmath3 has three distinct morse indices @xmath57 , focusing on the case where @xmath58 ; this takes up the bulk of the paper ,  [ basics]-[constructionn ] . in  [ 3-manifolds ] we explain how the proof carries over easily to the case when @xmath3 has four distinct morse indices @xmath59 , focusing on the case @xmath60 . in general",
    ", for any fixed number of morse indices for @xmath3 , all three steps in the proof are essentially the same as the dimension of @xmath0 varies .",
    "( see  [ 2nfiber ] , for example , to see why this is so . )",
    "that is why we look at the slightly more concrete cases where @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "( we focus on the case @xmath58 rather than @xmath62 because the latter case is actually a little confusing from the general point of view , because of its very low dimension . )    as it happens , closed 4-manifolds admitting handle decompositions without 1- and 3-handles form a fairly rich class of examples .",
    "this class includes @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and elliptic surfaces ( assuming simply - connected with sections , see @xcite ) , and it is closed under connected sum ( so blow up in particular ) .",
    "it is not known if it includes all simply - connected closed 4-manifolds , or even all hypersurfaces in @xmath65 ; this has been a long standing question .",
    "( recently , however , a famously conjectured counter - example , the dolgachef surface @xcite , has been proved by akbulut @xcite to be in this class as well . ) see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more extensive discussions .",
    "given @xmath28 there is a standard ( and fairly easy ) construction for producing a lefschetz fibration with fiber @xmath6 and vanishing spheres @xmath30 .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "we , however , construct @xmath51 in a different , more explicit , way in order to facilitate the construction of @xmath46 . actually ,",
    "most of the difficulty for us is concentrated in this non - standard construction of @xmath32 ( see  [ basics]-[computingvc ] ) after which the contruction of @xmath46 is relatively easy ( see  [ constructionn ] ) . + our strategy for constructing @xmath51 is as follows .",
    "for simplicity of notation assume that @xmath3 has just one critical point of each index , say @xmath66 .",
    "our aim is for @xmath67 to have exactly three critical values @xmath68 ; these will lie on the real line and correspond to the critical values of @xmath3 .",
    "we first construct three lefschetz fibrations , one for each critical value @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a small disk around @xmath69 of radius @xmath72 .",
    "the aim is to construct @xmath32 so that @xmath73 is equal to the restriction of @xmath41 to a small disk around @xmath69 , namely @xmath74 .",
    "each @xmath75 will have a unique critical point , say @xmath76 , with just one vanishing sphere corresponding to @xmath76 . in this case",
    "there is a standard construction ( namely ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.10 ) ) which we use to produce each @xmath75 ( see  [ pis ] ) .",
    "the regular fiber of each @xmath75 , say @xmath77 , will be exact symplectomorphic to @xmath6 .",
    "the key new ingredient in our construction of @xmath51 is a twisting operation @xmath78 that we use to define @xmath79 .",
    "roughly , @xmath80 is defined by deleting a weinstein neighborhood of some chosen lagrangian sphere and then gluing it back in with a @xmath81 twist .",
    "( see  [ pi2 ] for the precise definition ; we will explain its main properties in a moment . ) by construction , @xmath82,@xmath83,@xmath84 have regular fibers given by canonical isomorphisms as follows : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 the main point of the twisting operation @xmath88 is that there is a canonical isomorphism @xmath89 ( see lemma [ leftfiber = m ] ) and a natural exact symplectomorphism @xmath90 such that , under the canonical isomorphisms @xmath89 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 coresponds precisely to the symplectic transport map @xmath93 along a half circle in the lower half plane from @xmath94 to @xmath95 ( see lemma [ halftwist ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath92 is somewhat like a `` half generalized dehn - twist '' ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "+ to construct @xmath8 ( see  [ pi ] ) , first consider the boundary connected sum of @xmath96 to @xmath97 , where we delete neighborhoods of @xmath94 and @xmath98 and then identify along the resulting boundaries . then , similarly , we boundary connect - sum @xmath96 to @xmath99 at @xmath95 and @xmath100 .",
    "this yields @xmath101 then @xmath32 is defined to be the lefschetz fibration over @xmath102 obtained by identifying the corresponding fibers of @xmath103 at @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively with the fiber of @xmath104 at @xmath98 , and the fiber of @xmath105 at @xmath100 . for this",
    "we use the identifications we mentioned above @xmath106 @xmath107 ( this operation on lefschetz fibrations is called _ fiber connected sum_see  [ fiberconnectsum ] . )      to construct the required exact lagrangian embedding @xmath46 we use a handle - type decomposition of @xmath0 induced by the morse function @xmath3 , which is due to milnor @xcite . for example , let us take the usual handle - decomposition of @xmath108 with three handles .",
    "then , in the corresponding milnor decomposition there are four pieces :    , the pieces @xmath109,@xmath110 ( top ) , @xmath111 ( bottom left ) , @xmath112 ( bottom right ) .",

    "that the @xmath119handle ( in the usual handle - decomposition ) is attached using an embedding @xmath120 { \\longrightarrow}s^1 = \\partial n_0.\\ ] ] then the last piece is @xmath121 \\times [ -1 , 1].\\ ] ] this last piece has no analogue in a usual handle - decomposition ; roughly , it fills in the rest of the space in @xmath0 after @xmath122 are glued together .",
    "see figure [ handledec ] for a picture of the pieces in the milnor decomposition of @xmath108 . + now consider the similar case when @xmath61 , and @xmath3 has three critical points @xmath66 , with morse indices @xmath123 . then there is a similar milnor decomposition of @xmath0 with , for example , @xmath124 . to construct @xmath46 in this case ( see  [ constructionn ] ) , we define several lagrangian manifolds @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 with boundary ( with corners ) which correspond to exactly to the pieces in the milnor decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "because of the way the fibers of the @xmath129 are constructed and the way the @xmath129 are glued together , these @xmath130 glue together exactly as in the milnor decomposition of @xmath0 ( in particular , with the correct framings ) . from this it follows that the union @xmath131 is smooth and diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .      here is a summary of the contents of this paper .",
    "* we explain some techniques necessary for constructing the regular fiber @xmath6 and the vanishing spheres in @xmath6 .",
    "( we only sketch the main ideas in this paper .",
    "see @xcite for details . )",
    "the main technique involves attaching morse - bott type handles in the weinstein category .",
    "this in turn is related to a generalization of lagrangian surgery to the case where the lagrangians intersect along any submanifold .",
    "this lagrangian surgery construction is used to define the vanishing spheres , and it is also used in the construction of @xmath6 in general . *",
    "we explain how to construct the regular fiber @xmath6 and the vanishing spheres in @xmath6 .",
    "we discuss the case when @xmath3 has three or four distinct morse indices in detail , and we give a partial sketch of the general case .",
    "* we review some basic constructions for symplectic lefschetz fibrations .",
    "already in this section we specialize to situations relevant to the case where @xmath61 , and @xmath3 has only three distinct morse indices @xmath123 . * we construct three lefschetz fibrations @xmath132 , @xmath133 as discussed sketched in  [ esketch ] above .",
    "* we construct @xmath32 as the fiber connected sum of @xmath104 , @xmath134 @xmath105 , as sketched in ",
    "[ esketch ] above . *",
    "we check that the vanishing spheres of @xmath32 with respect to certain vanishing paths are indeed the expected lagrangian spheres in @xmath6 .",
    "* we construct an exact lagrangian embedding @xmath46 , as sketched in ",
    "[ nsketch ] , which satisfies the statements in theorem @xmath31 .",
    "( see theorem [ main ] and proposition [ prophomotopyequiv ] . ) * we look at the case when @xmath13 has morse indices @xmath135 , focusing on the case @xmath60 .",
    "we explain the construction of @xmath32 , and also the construction of @xmath46 .      in the rest of this introduction we will attempt to motivate problem [ complexify ] , and our proposed solution theorem @xmath31 , from the point of view of symplectic topology .",
    "the most basic idea is that lefschetz fibrations on a symplectic manifold @xmath136 give a non - unique description of the total space @xmath136 in terms of a regular hypersurface @xmath137 and the vanishing spheres in @xmath138 ( analogous to a handle - decomposition in differential topology ) .",
    "thus , in principle , well - understood lefschetz fibrations for cotangent bundles should lead to insights about their symplectic topology . for more on this line of thought ,",
    "see section [ bifibrations ] below .",
    "+ a more subtle and surprising fact is that lefschetz fibrations on a symplectic manifold @xmath136 can also be used to analyze arbitrary lagrangian submanifolds @xmath139 , and this is the more immediate source of our interest in problem [ complexify ] .",
    "the original geometric idea , due to donalson , is that @xmath139 should be some kind of combination of the lefschetz thimbles , obtained by surgery operations .",
    "this has only been partially developed so far in the form of matching paths and matching cycles , as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see  [ matchingpaths ] for the definition and for some plans to develop this further ) .",
    "nevertheless there is a rigorous algebraic version , due to seidel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 18.25 ) , which is formulated in the fukaya category of @xmath136 :    * _ any @xmath139 can be expressed as a combination of the lefschetz thimbles by repeatedly forming mapping cones .",
    "_    implicitly , this takes place in a context where `` mapping cone '' makes sense , namely the so - called _ derived _ fukaya category of @xmath136 .",
    "( conjecturally , mapping cones correspond to lagrangian surgery , and so the algebraic and geometric view points should coincide . )",
    "+ theorem @xmath31 feeds into both of these ( algebraic and geometric ) ideas .",
    "first , and foremost , it provides a good class of lefschetz fibrations to be used in combination with seidel s decomposition ( @xmath140 ) . in future work",
    "we will use this idea to study exact lagrangian submanifolds @xmath141 , along the lines of @xcite ( see  [ nearby ] for more on this ) .",
    "second , theorem @xmath31 helps to develop donalson s original geometric idea , because we indeed construct @xmath46 by doing surgery operations among the lefschetz thimbles .",
    "( actually , while this is essentially true , there is still some work to be done to relate what we do in this paper to that view point . )",
    "thus the construction of @xmath0 serves as a model for how to decompose any given lagrangian @xmath142 fibering over some path in terms of the lefschetz thimbles .",
    "a closely related idea is to define _ generalized matching paths _ for arbitrary manifolds .",
    "this involves going in the reverse direction : one starts with an embedded path @xmath143 which passes through several critical values ; then , one _ constructs _ a lagrangian @xmath142 which fibers over @xmath144 , assuming that the lefschetz thimbles lying over @xmath144 satisfy suitable _ matching conditions_. we will explore both these ideas in future work ( see [ matchingpaths ] for more details ) .",
    "+ finally , we mention there is a conjecture of seidel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 7.1 ) which suggests a way to use theorem @xmath31 , theorem @xmath145 in @xcite , and ( @xmath140 ) to relate the two approaches of fukaya - seidel - smith @xcite and nadler - zaslow @xcite for analyzing the fukaya category of a cotangent bundle ( the first approach being picard - lefschetz theory , and the second being comparison with constructible sheaves on @xmath0 ) .",
    "we will not elaborate on this here , but we refer the reader to @xcite for more on this .      in the most optimistic view , one can start with a lefschetz fibration on @xmath14 ( or any symplectic manifold ) and proceding inductively by introducing a new lefschetz fibration on the fiber and , continuing in this way , reduce the symplectic topology of the total space to some combinatorial data .",
    "this strategy was successfully carried out very explicitly in the case of the quartic surface in @xcite , and then generalized to a more abstract general setting in @xcite . in general ,",
    "one often has very little detailed knowledge of the lefschetz fibration , and it may be very complicated .",
    "for example , if we are studying a closed symplectic 4-manifold @xmath136 , the only thing to do in general is take a donaldson pencil on @xmath136 ( or maybe a variation on that which maps to @xmath63 ) .",
    "then , the combinatorial data one gets in this way can not be reasonably handled , and in fact basic questions reduce to some hard combinatorial group theory problems , as in @xcite . with this in mind , it is intriguing to start with one of our relatively simple and very explicit lefschetz fibrations @xmath67 ( and let us suppose for simplicity that @xmath34 as in remark [ pivsfc ] ) .",
    "then we can ask : is there a similar lefschetz fibration , say @xmath146 defined on the regular fiber ?",
    "naively , this seems plausible since @xmath6 is obtained , roughly speaking , by plumbing several disk cotangent bundles together ( see  [ mgeneral ] ) , and one would hope that the model complexifications on each of these disk cotangent bundles can be made to agree on the overlaps , so that they patch together to yield a fibration on @xmath6 . ( the actual construction , though , must combine the fibrations on each disk cotangent bundle in a more sophisticated way , by combining the regular fibers of each of the fibrations into one new regular fiber for the putative fibration on @xmath6 . ) in any case , once this is known one would like to extend this to the slightly more sophisticated set up of a bifibration on @xmath10 .",
    "roughly , this is a holomorphic map @xmath147 , with generic singularities , encoding a family of lefschetz fibrations on the fibers of a lefschetz fibration on @xmath10 .",
    "( for the precise definition , see @xcite . ) as pointed out to me by maydanskiy , one potential application of such a bifibration ( together with work in progress of seidel ) would be to construct exotic cotangent bundles along the same lines as maydanskiy s recent work on exotic sphere cotangent bundles @xcite .",
    "more tentatively , such bifibrations ( and similar structures on the fibers of @xmath83 , etc . ) may lead to interesting matching relations among lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath10 , @xmath6 , etc .",
    ", in a spirit similar to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( see section [ matchingpaths ] below for more about matching conditions which apply to lagrangian submanifolds more general than spheres . )",
    "donaldson s idea is as follows .",
    "first , one assumes that @xmath41 maps @xmath148 onto an embedded path @xmath144 such that @xmath149\\ ] ] is a morse function , either by constructing a suitable @xmath41 for a given @xmath148 ( as achieved in @xcite ) , or perhaps by deforming the given @xmath148 and @xmath32 .",
    "then , each critical point of @xmath3 is a critical point of @xmath41 lying on @xmath148 , and each unstable and stable manifold of @xmath3 is part of a lefschetz thimble of @xmath41 .",
    "the expectation is that @xmath148 is isotopic to a surgery - theoretic combination of all these lefschetz thimbles .",
    "this is well - understood when @xmath148 is a sphere and @xmath144 runs between just two critical values : @xmath148 is then the union of two lefschetz thimbles meeting at a common vanishing sphere and @xmath144 is called a _ matching path _ , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ as we mentioned above , the proof of theorem @xmath31 involves constructing @xmath46 by doing successive surgery operations involving the lefschetz thimbles , just as in donaldson s proposed decomposition .",
    "more precisely , let us assume for convenience of notation that @xmath3 has just one critical point of each index .",
    "then , we construct a sequence of ( not neccesarliy closed ) lagrangian submanifolds @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is diffeomorphic to the @xmath152th _ sublevel _ set of @xmath153 , i.e. @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is small , @xmath156 is the @xmath152th critical value of @xmath3 , and @xmath157 is obtained by a kind of lagrangian surgery . in future work we will develop two ideas suggested by this decomposition .",
    "first , if @xmath158 is an arbitrary lagrangian in the total space of an arbitrary lefschetz fibration then the above construction can serve as a model for how to decompose @xmath148 as a surgery - theoretic combination of the the lefschetz thimbles , thus making donalson s idea more precise .",
