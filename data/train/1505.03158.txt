    "over the past two decades , observations of exoplanets have uncovered a stunning diversity of systems .",
    "major improvements in the capabilities of space- and ground - based telescopes in recent years have led to the discovery and characterization of hundreds of new exoplanets , covering a broad range of orbital properties , interior and atmospheric compositions , and host star types @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", these same technological advances have enabled the detailed study of the atmospheric properties of the brightest and largest planets through high - precision photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "most of these targets belong to the class of gas giant planets known as hot jupiters .",
    "the high levels of incident flux , slow rotation , and potentially large temperature gradients between hemispheres characteristic of these planets allow us to test atmospheric models in a new regime unlike any found in the solar system .",
    "in addition , hot jupiters are some of the most favorable targets for measuring elemental abundances , since most material is not in a condensed form at these high temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "atmospheric circulation models of hot jupiters predict broad super - rotating equatorial jets that circulate energy between the day and night sides , with the precise effect of these winds on the day - to - night temperature contrast being strongly dependent on the particular orbital and atmospheric properties of the planet ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as a result of their short orbital periods , hot jupiters have high atmospheric temperatures and emit relatively strongly at infrared wavelengths , allowing for direct measurement of their atmospheric brightness as a function of orbital phase .",
    "these phase curves can then be converted into a longitudinal temperature profile @xcite . by comparing the measured phase curves to theoretical phase curves generated by atmospheric models",
    ", we can constrain fundamental properties of the atmosphere , such as the efficiency of heat transport from the day side to the night side , radiative time scales , wind speeds , and compositional gradients between the day and night sides .    to date , well - characterized phase curve observations have been published for eleven planets : @xmath10 and b @xcite , hd 189733b @xcite , hd 149026b @xcite , hd 80606b @xcite , hat - p-7b @xcite , kepler-7b @xcite , corot-1b @xcite , wasp-12b @xcite , wasp-18b @xcite , hat - p-2b @xcite , and hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "the majority of these observations were carried out using the _ spitzer space telescope _ while the rest were obtained at optical wavelengths by the _",
    "corot _ and _ kepler _ missions .",
    "recently , the first spectroscopic phase curve was obtained for the hot jupiter wasp-43b using the _ hubble space telescope _ between 1.2 and 1.6 @xmath1 m @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present full - orbit phase curves of the hot jupiter wasp-14b in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m bands obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope_. photometric and radial - velocity observations of wasp-14b indicate a mass of @xmath11 and a radius of @xmath12 , corresponding to a density of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the planet lies on an eccentric orbit ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) around a young host star ( age @xmath15  gyr , spectral type f5 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18  k , and @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a period of 2.24 days and an orbital semi - major axis of @xmath20  au .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of wasp-14b is relatively high ( @xmath21  k , assuming zero albedo and reemission from the entire surface ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the thermal evolution of wasp-14b may be significantly affected by ohmic dissipation in a partially - ionized atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ; but for debate see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed secondary eclipse observations in the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0@xmath1 m _ spitzer _ bands and found no evidence for a thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere , while concluding that the data are consistent with relatively poor energy redistribution from dayside to nightside .",
    "@xcite find that , based on the dayside fluxes , the most highly - irradiated planets have systematically less efficient day / night heat circulation .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion from a comparison of the fractional day - night flux differences of planets for which phase curves have been obtained .",
    "this overall trend has been explained by hydrodynamical models @xcite .",
    "phase curve observations at more than one wavelength provide complementary information about the properties of the planet s atmosphere , as different wavelengths probe different pressure levels within the atmosphere .",
    "multiband measurements of the planet s brightness can also be transformed into low - resolution dayside and nightside emission spectra , which can reveal differences in atmospheric composition .",
    "only five systems have phase curve observations at more than one wavelength : hd 189733 @xcite , wasp-12 @xcite , wasp-18 @xcite , hat - p-2 @xcite , and wasp-43 @xcite . while single - wavelength phase curves can be reasonably well - matched by standard atmospheric circulation models , none of the multi - wavelength phase curves are satisfactorily reproduced by these same models .",
    "this suggests that our understanding of the physical and chemical processes that drive atmospheric circulation is still incomplete .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the observations and data reduction methodology are described in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we discuss the phase curve model used in our analysis and present the best - fit parameters .",
    "we then use our results to obtain updated orbital parameters and discuss the implications of our phase curve fits for the planet s atmospheric dynamics in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we observed two full orbits of wasp-14b in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m channels of the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. the observation periods were ut 2012 april 15@xmath2217 and ut 2012 april 24@xmath2226 for the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m bandpasses , respectively .",
    "both observations lasted approximately 64 hours and were carried out in subarray mode , which generated 32 @xmath23 32 pixel ( 39@xmath2439@xmath25 ) images with 2.0  s integration times , resulting in a total of 113,408 images in each bandpass . due to long - term drift of the telescope pointing ,",
    "the telescope was repositioned approximately every 12 hours in order to re - center the target , leading to four breaks in each phase curve observation with a combined duration of about 16 minutes .",
    "the telescope repositioning produced offsets of up to 0.2 pixels in the star s position on the array after each break ( figures  [ data1 ] and [ data2 ] ) .",

    "in addition , we exclude the top ( 32nd ) row of pixels , which have values that are consistently lower than those from other pixels in the array .",
    "we take the remaining set of pixels and iteratively trim values that lie more than @xmath28 from the median .",
    "we then calculate the average sky background across the image by fitting a gaussian function to the histogram of the remaining pixel values . after subtracting the sky background , any remaining transient `` hot pixels '' in each set of 64 images varying by more than @xmath28 from the median pixel value",
    "are replaced by the median pixel value . in both bandpasses ,",
    "the average percentage of replaced pixels is less than @xmath29 .",
    "to determine the position of the star on the array in each image , we calculate the flux - weighted centroid for a circular region of radius @xmath30 pixels centered on the estimated position of the star ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "we then estimate the width of the star s psf by computing the noise pixel parameter @xcite , which is defined in section  2.2.2 of the _ spitzer / irac _ instrument handbook as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the intensity detected in the @xmath33th pixel .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath34 to be the radius of the circular aperture used to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "we calculate the flux of the stellar target in each image using circular aperture photometry .",
    "we generate two sets of apertures : the first set uses a fixed aperture with radii ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 pixels in 0.1-pixel steps and from 3.0 to 5.0 pixels in 0.5-pixel steps .",
    "the second set utilizes a time - varying radius that is related to the square - root of the noise pixel parameter @xmath35 by either a constant scaling factor or a constant shift ( see * ? ? ? * for a full discussion of the noise - pixel - based aperture ) .",
    "the optimal choice of aperture photometry is determined by selecting data from 8000 images spanning the planetary transit with a total duration of 4.4  hours and calculating the photometric series for each choice of aperture .",
    "we then fit each photometric series with our transit light curve model ( section  [ subsec : eventmodel ] ) , compute the rms scatter in the resultant residuals binned in five - minute intervals , and choose the values of @xmath30 and @xmath34 as well as aperture type that give the minimum scatter . in these fits , we fix the planet s orbital parameters to the most recent values in the literature : @xmath36  d , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "for the 3.6  @xmath1 m data set , we find that a fixed aperture with a radius of 1.8  pixels and @xmath41 produce the minimum scatter .",
    "when using a fixed aperture , the noise pixel parameter is not needed , so @xmath34 is undefined . in the 4.5  @xmath1 m bandpass",
    ", we prefer a fixed aperture with a radius of 2.9  pixels and @xmath42 .",
    "prior to fitting the selected photometric series with our full light curve model , we use a moving median filter to iteratively remove points with measured fluxes , @xmath43 positions , @xmath27 positions , or @xmath44 values that vary by more than 3@xmath45 from the corresponding median values in the adjacent 64 frames in the time series . choosing a larger or smaller interval for computing the median values does not significantly affect the number of excised points .",
    "the percentages of excised points are 1.8@xmath46 and 1.6@xmath46 in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m bandpasses , respectively .",
    "each full - orbit observation contains one transit and two secondary eclipses .",
    "we model these events using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the transit light curve includes four free parameters : the scaled orbital semi - major axis @xmath47 , the inclination @xmath33 , the center of transit time @xmath48 , and the planet - star radius ratio @xmath49 , which is the square root of the relative transit depth .",
    "each secondary eclipse event is defined by a center of eclipse time @xmath50 and a relative eclipse depth @xmath51 , measured with respect to the value of the phase curve at mid - transit , in addition to @xmath47 and @xmath33 , thus yielding four additional free parameters : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we ensure continuity between the phase curve and secondary eclipse light curves by scaling the amplitudes of eclipse ingress and egress ( when the planet is partially occulted by the star ) appropriately to match the out - of - eclipse phase curve values at the start and end of the eclipse .",

    "wasp-14b has a relatively low eccentricity of 0.08 , and therefore the variation in the planet s apparent brightness throughout an orbit can be modeled to first order as a simple sinusoidal function of the true anomaly @xmath61 @xcite , analogous in form to a simple sine or cosine of the orbital phase angle that is used in the case of a circular orbit @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the star s flux ( assumed to be constant and normalized to one ) , @xmath64 is the amplitude of the phase variations , and @xmath65 represents the lag between the peak of the planet s temperature and the time of maximum incident stellar flux due to the finite atmospheric radiative timescale of the planet . here ,",

    "small changes in the telescope pointing during observation cause variations in the measured flux from the target , resulting in a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the raw extracted photometric series . in our analysis , we decorrelate this instrumental systematic in two ways .    our first approach to removing the intrapixel sensitivity effect is called pixel mapping @xcite . in an image @xmath66 ,",
    "the location of the target on the array is given by the measured centroid position @xmath67 , and the sensitivity of the pixel at that location is determined by comparing other images with measured centroid positions near @xmath67 .",
    "the effective pixel sensitivity at a given position is calculated as follows : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the flux measured in the @xmath66th image and @xmath70 is the intrinsic flux ; @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath35 are the measured @xmath43 position , @xmath27 position , and noise pixel parameter values .",

    "we chose this number of neighbors to be large enough to adequately map the pixel response while maintaining a reasonably low computational overhead @xcite .",
    "several previous studies of _ spitzer _ phase curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath79 dependence of white noise on bin size is shown by the dashed black line;the trend is normalized at bin size @xmath80 to the photon noise level corresponding to the median photon count over the 3.6  @xmath1 m photometric series , with sky background included.,width=340 ]    the second approach is a recently proposed technique known as pixel - level decorrelation ( pld ; see * ? ? ? * for a complete description ) .",
    "unlike most other treatments of the intrapixel sensitivity effect , pld does not attempt to relate the variations in the calculated position of the target on the pixel to the apparent intensity fluctuations .",
    "rather , it utilizes the actual measured intensities of the individual pixels spanning the stellar psf to provide an expression of the total measured flux .",
    "we consider pixels lying in a @xmath81 box centered on the star , which have pixel intensities @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "we divide each 3 @xmath23 3 pixel box by the summed flux over all nine pixels in order to remove ( at least to zeroth order ) any astrophysical flux variations , giving the following relation : @xmath84 the intrapixel sensitivity effect is modeled as a linear combination of the arrays @xmath85 , and thus the total measured intensity @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the astrophysical model , comprising the phase curve , transit , and eclipses . the parameters @xmath89 are the linear coefficients that are determined through least - squares fitting , and @xmath90 is a free normalization parameter that corrects for the overall numerical offset introduced by the linear sum of pixel intensity arrays .",
    "following @xcite , we also include a linear ramp in time with a slope parameter @xmath91 .    in @xcite ,",
    "pld was applied to fitting _",
    "secondary eclipses of several exoplanets , including wasp-14b .",
    "pld was found to be generally more effective in removing time - correlated ( i.e. , red ) noise , resulting in lower residual scatter from the best - fit solution when compared with other decorrelation techniques .",
    "the best results were obtained when the photometric time series were binned , pixel by pixel , prior to pld fitting , since binning improves the precision of the measured intensities in pixels at the edge of the stellar psf and can be adjusted to reduce the noise on the timescale of interest .",
    "when fitting our full - orbit wasp-14b photometric series using the pld technique , we experimented with fitting either unbinned or binned data , with bin sizes equal to powers of two up to 256 ( @xmath928.5 minutes ) .",
    "we found that larger bin sizes , comparable to or exceeding the occultation ingress / egress timescale of roughly 20 minutes , cause excessive loss of temporal resolution and yielded unsatisfactory secondary eclipse and transit light curve fits .",
    "after fitting the model light curve to the data using pld , we subtract the best - fit solution from the raw unbinned data to produce the residual series , which we use to evaluate the relative amount of time - correlated noise remaining in the data .    in figure",
    "[ comparison ] , we compare the noise properties of each version of the 3.6  @xmath1 m residual time series to the ideal @xmath79 scaling we would expect for the case of independent ( i.e. ,  white \" noise ) gaussian measurement errors , where @xmath93 is the bin size . the white noise trend is normalized at bin size @xmath80 to the photon noise level corresponding to the median photon count over the observation data set ( with sky background included ) . comparing the various pld fits , we find that at small bin sizes , unbinned pld gives the lowest residual scatter , while at larger bin sizes approaching the duration of eclipse ingress or egress , pld with larger bins results in lower residual scatter .",
    "the same trend is seen when fitting the 4.5  @xmath1 m data .",
    "@xcite found that the optimal pld performance is achieved when the range of star positions is lower than 0.2  pixels .",
    "the range of pixel motion in our full - orbit phase curve observations modestly exceeds this limit , and we indeed find that the residual scatter from the pixel mapping fits is smaller than the scatter from any of the pld fits .",
    "we conclude that the pixel mapping technique produces the lowest residual scatter for our full - orbit observation data sets , and we therefore use this technique in the final version of our analysis .",
    "in addition to having higher residual scatter than the pixel mapping solutions , the pld fits yield eclipse depth and phase curve parameter estimates that often differ strongly from the corresponding values derived from fits with pixel mapping ; these discrepancies sometimes exceed the @xmath28 level .",
    "the best - fit values derived from the pld fits also display a higher level of variation across different choices of binning , photometric aperture , and exponential ramp type ( see section  [ subsec : ramp ] ) than in the case of pixel mapping fits .",
    "this points toward an inherent instability in the pld method when fitting full - orbit phase curves that may be related to the larger range in star motions characteristic of such data sets .",
    "previous studies using _",
    "spitzer_/irac have noted a short - duration ramp at the beginning of each observation , and again after downlinks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ramp has a characteristic asymptotic shape that typically decays to a constant value on timescales of an hour or less in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m bandpasses .",
    "we first experimented with removing the first 30 or 60 minutes of data from each phase curve observation , selecting the removal interval that minimizes the residual rms from the best - fit solution binned in five - minute intervals . we find that in both bandpasses , we obtain the best results when we do not trim any data from the start of the observations .",
    "when examining the residual time series , we noticed a small ramp visible at the start of the 3.6  @xmath1 m observations .",
    "we therefore considered whether or not our fits might be further improved by the addition of an exponential function .",
    "we experimented with including an exponential ramp in our phase curve model , using the formulation given in @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the time since the beginning of the observation , and @xmath96@xmath97 are correction coefficients . to determine whether this function is necessary and",
    "if so , how many exponential terms to include in the ramp model , we use the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , defined as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of free parameters in the fit , and @xmath100 is the number of data points . by minimizing the bic , we select the type of ramp model that yields the smallest residuals without `` over - fitting '' the data . for the 3.6  @xmath1 m data , we find that using a single exponential ramp gives a marginally lower bic compared to the no - ramp case , while for the 4.5  @xmath1 m data , no ramp is needed at all .",

    "meanwhile , the higher - than - predicted 4.5  @xmath1 m nightside emission points toward a slight reduction in the atmospheric opacity at that wavelength relative to the models .",
    "one possible explanation for both of these trends is an increased c / o ratio .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that increasing the c / o ratio above equilibrium values leads to an excess of ch@xmath240 and a depletion of co. this enhances the opacity in the 3.6  @xmath1 m bandpass where ch@xmath240 has strong vibrational bands , while reducing the opacity in the 4.5  @xmath1 m bandpass where co has strong vibrational bands .",
    "an enhanced c / o ratio can also be invoked to explain the higher amplitude of the 3.6  @xmath1 m phase curve as compared with the 4.5  @xmath1 m phase curve . in this scenario",
    "the 3.6  @xmath1 m bandpass would probe lower pressure regions that have strong day / night contrasts due to a combination of short radiative timescales and the possible presence of a dayside temperature inversion .",
    "a relative depletion of co would shift the 4.5  @xmath1 m photosphere to higher pressures , where longer radiative timescales facilitate more efficient day - night heat transport , resulting in a reduced phase curve amplitude .",
    "we note , however , that recent spectroscopic surveys of m dwarfs suggest that the occurrence of high c / o ratios in stellar atmospheres appears to be low ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at the same time",
    ", models of disk chemistry predict that the c / o ratio of the solids and gas in the disk may vary as a function of disk radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , different snowlines of oxygen- and carbon - rich ices are expected to result in systematic variations in the c / o ratio of gaseous material across the protoplanetary disk .",
    "gas giants that derive most of their atmosphere from the gas disk outside of the water snowline but inside of the carbon dioxide snowline may therefore end up with high atmospheric c / o ratios .",
    "we also note that @xcite showed that planets with high c / o ratios should naturally have less tio and correspondingly weaker temperature inversion , consistent with our previous discussion of wasp-14b s dayside emission .",
    "in addition , @xcite show that atmospheric models with high c / o ratios often predict reduced emission at longer wavelengths ( @xmath241  @xmath1 m ) and may explain the low 8.0  @xmath1 m planetary flux ratio ( see figure  [ jonathan ] ) .    an alternative explanation for the planet s low 3.6  @xmath1 m nightside emission is the presence of high - altitude silicate clouds on the cold nightside in or above the photosphere .",
    "the formation of an equilibrium silicate cloud is possible at the photospheric pressures ( @xmath92100  mbar ) probed on the nightside of wasp-14b by these observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it is expected that the presence of a thick cloud would suppress both the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m nightside fluxes from the planet , and the resulting planetary emission spectrum would resemble a blackbody with an effective temperature corresponding to that of the cloud tops . while the low 3.6  @xmath1 m nightside brightness temperature of @xmath242  k ( @xmath5 upper limit ) is consistent with a cold emitting layer , the two nightside band fluxes together are not consistent with a single blackbody spectrum .    in this scenario ,",
    "the high 4.5  @xmath1 m nightside emission ( corresponding to a brightness temperature of @xmath243  k ) could be explained by introducing an emitting layer of co in a warmer thermosphere that is situated above the cold cloud tops @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear how a high - altitude temperature inversion might arise on the nightside , as there is no incident stellar irradiation and the efficiency of recirculation from the dayside should be relatively weak at low pressures . therefore , an enhanced c / o ratio in wasp-14b s atmosphere provides a more straightforward explanation for the observed differences between wasp-14b s 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m phase curves .",
    "further observations of wasp-14b , possibly with _ hubble space telescope _",
    "s wide field camera 3 , would provide important additional information to constrain wasp-14b s composition and either support or refute the high atmospheric c / o ratio scenario posited here for wasp-14b .",

    "we define the measured dayside brightness in each bandpass to be the measured secondary eclipse depth , while for the the nightside data points , we used the value of the best - fit relative planetary phase curve @xmath204 calculated at the mid - transit time in each bandpass . looking at the dayside spectra , we see that the @xmath249 and @xmath250 model spectrum comes closest to matching the measured data points at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m .",
    "this suggests that wasp-14b has poor day - night recirculation and a moderate thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere .    on the nightside , as in the sparc models ,",
    "none of the models reproduce the low measured 3.6  @xmath1 m brightness , while the measured 4.5  @xmath1 m flux ratio is most consistent with the @xmath251 model . as discussed earlier in the context of the sparc models ,",
    "this discrepancy is consistent with the hypothesis that wasp-14b might have an enhanced c / o ratio .",
    "we also note that large deviations from solar - like equilibrium chemical composition could yield a larger disparity in the pressures probed on the dayside and nightside than is accounted for in our models .",
    "specifically , one could be probing a deeper than expected pressure level on the nightside , where circulation is efficient ( high @xmath246 ) , while probing a higher - up ( lower pressure ) level on the dayside , where the circulation is less efficient ( low @xmath246 ) .",
    "this scenario is especially probable when there is a dayside temperature inversion , as our data suggest .",
    "finally , we compare the albedo and recirculation derived from our best - fit phase curves to other hot jupiters for which full - orbit thermal measurements have been obtained . following the methods described in @xcite",
    ", we use the measured eclipse depths and phase curve amplitudes to calculate the error - weighted dayside and nightside brightness temperatures , with corrections for the contamination due to reflected light : @xmath252  k and @xmath253  k. although these methods were developed for planets on circular orbits , the low eccentricity of wasp-14b places it in a regime for which the model is still a reasonable approximation . from these temperatures ,",
    "we derive a bond albedo of @xmath254 ( @xmath2550.08 at @xmath142 ) and a day - night heat transport efficiency of @xmath256 , where the latter is defined such that @xmath257 means no heat recirculation to the nightside , and @xmath258 indicates complete redistribution .",
    "figure  [ planets ] shows the location of wasp-14b in albedo - recirculation space along with six other exoplanets with measured thermal phase curves .",
    "s low day - night heat transport efficiency and high irradiation temperature are consistent with the general observed trend that highly - irradiated hot jupiters have poor heat recirculation @xcite .",
    "both wasp-14b and wasp-18b have much lower estimated albedos than those of other jovian mass planets with thermal phase curve measurements ; they are also both significantly more massive ( @xmath259 vs. @xmath260 ) .",
    "the low estimated albedos of these massive planets , implied by their high thermal emission , may instead be indicative of the detection of some amount of thermal radiation from the planet s interior in addition to the re - radiated stellar flux .",
    "a different cooling and/or migration history for these massive planets could result in an added contribution to the planetary emission from the deep atmosphere ; the age of the wasp-14 system is relatively young ( @xmath2551  gyr ; * ? ? ? * ) , so this additional internal flux may be due to significant residual heat of formation .",
    "in addition , the higher internal fluxes of these higher - mass planets may support stronger magnetic fields than on smaller planets , which may lead to stronger ohmic dissipation in their atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , thereby providing a source of additional emission on the dayside .",
    "bond albedo and recirculation efficiency confidence regions for planets with thermal phase curve observations , as calculated using the methods of @xcite .",
    "the color of the bounding curves indicate irradiation temperature .",
    "wasp-14b has intermediate day - night heat transport , like other hot jupiters of similar temperature .",
    "however , it has a very low bond albedo , like wasp-18b . both of these planets are significantly more massive than the other planets in the sample , suggesting that they may be emitting detectable heat from the deep atmosphere or interior processes.,width=340 ]",
    "in this paper we present the first phase curve observations of the eccentric hot jupiter wasp-14b in the _ spitzer _ 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m bandpasses .",
    "we compare two different techniques  pixel mapping and pixel - level decorrelation  for correcting the intrapixel sensitivity effect and find that the pixel mapping method yields lower residual scatter from the best - fit solution .",
    "this is likely due to the relatively large range of star positions on the pixel throughout the full - orbit observations that may make the intrapixel sensitivity effect less amenable to modeling through pixel - level decorrelation .",
    "we obtain best - fit secondary eclipse depths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m , respectively , which are consistent with a single blackbody brightness temperature of @xmath4  k. these depths are in good agreement ( within @xmath142 ) with the ones reported by @xcite in their _ spitzer _ secondary eclipse analysis . combining the results of our global phase curve",
    "fits with previous radial velocity measurements , we derive updated values for orbital inclination , orbital eccentricity , longitude of pericenter , orbital semi - major axis , planet radius , and planet mass .",
    "we also combine our measured transit times with previously - published transit times to arrive at a more precise estimate of wasp-14b s orbital period : @xmath261  days .",
    "comparison of the measured dayside planetary emission with spectra generated from a one - dimensional radiative transfer model @xcite suggests relatively inefficient day - night heat recirculation and a moderate dayside temperature inversion .",
    "the relatively high dayside blackbody temperature provides additional support for the idea that the day - night circulation is inefficient .",
    "the flux maxima precede the secondary eclipses , consistent with other hot jupiter lightcurves and with predictions of general circulation models ( gcms ) , suggesting the possibility of equatorial superrotation on wasp-14b .",
    "we also utilize a three - dimensional gcm @xcite to generate theoretical light curves for an atmosphere in thermochemical equilibrium both with and without a dayside temperature inversion .",
    "we find that the measured amplitude and location of minimum / maximum flux in both bandpasses are more consistent with predictions from the model light curve with a dayside thermal inversion .",
    "meanwhile , the measured nightside planetary emission at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 m is not adequately described by either the one - dimensional or the three - dimensional models .",
    "in particular , the very low 3.6  @xmath1 m nightside planetary flux indicates a significantly higher atmospheric opacity at that wavelength than is predicted by the models , which may point toward an enhanced c / o ratio . in the context of other planets with full - orbit thermal measurements",
    ", we find that wasp -14b fits the general trend that highly - irradiated hot jupiters have poor heat recirculation , while the derived bond albedo is very small ( @xmath2550.08 at @xmath142 ) and the planet s large mass might indicate that wasp-14b is emitting residual heat from its formation",
    ".    the question of whether wasp-14b has an enhanced c / o ratio can be further addressed by obtaining measurements of the host star s c / o ratio .",
    "we note that wasp-14 has a near - solar metallicity ( @xmath262fe / h@xmath263 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so from a statistical standpoint , it is not expected to have a high c / o ratio @xcite .",
    "future work will explore how the assumed c / o ratio in the atmospheres of hot - jupiters like wasp-14b affects global circulation patterns and day / night temperature contrasts .",
    "the discrepancy between the model - predicted and measured nightside planetary flux underlines the need for further exploration of the available parameter space in both 1d and gcm models of hot jupiter atmospheres . assessing the effects of non - solar chemistry , and specifically different c / o ratios , will give us new insight into the interplay between various atmospheric properties and the resultant planetary emission .",
    "these studies promise to greatly enhance the ability of numerical models to explain features in the growing body of exoplanet phase curves .",
    "obtaining more infrared phase curves of massive planets and calculating their bond albedo will allow us to determine whether low bond albedo is strongly correlated with high planet mass , as is the case for wasp-14b and wasp-18b , and further consider the contribution of residual heat from formation in the overall emission of massive hot jupiters .",
    "a better understanding of the role of residual heat from formation in the flux of massive planets is also important for directly - imaged planets , as cooling curves are used to estimate the planetary mass based on the age of the system and the measured luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we can determine whether current cooling models can reproduce the observed emission from wasp-14b , it would serve as an independent confirmation of the evolutionary models used in studies of directly imaged planets .",
