    "the hartree and hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field approaches have been extensively used in the past to study atomic - like properties of semiconductor quantum dots such as , e.g. , those measured in conductance and capacitance experiments.@xcite symmetry restricted approximations , as well as spin and/or space unrestricted hf solutions have been analyzed.@xcite these methods give results that are satisfactory for a qualitative understanding of many properties of these systems .",
    "however , comparison with exact configuration - interaction diagonalization@xcite ( ci ) and quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) studies show discrepancies in the total energies that are substantial on the relevant energy scale .",
    "the discrepancies become even larger in the presence of a constant magnetic field which magnifies the importance of correlations . however , at high magnetic field qmc calculations are imprecise due to the fixed phase approximation and the exact diagonalization techniques require a number of configurations which increases exponentially with the number of particles , making the calculation unpractical for more than ten particles . an alternative method that has been shown to be quite accurate for cases in which hf yields broken symmetry solutions",
    "is that of symmetry restoration by projection,@xcite although its complexity also increases very rapidly with the number of particles .",
    "the ground state properties of many electrons quantum dots can also be calculated with local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) and current density functional methods.@xcite these approaches are based on energy functionals obtained through fits and interpolations of qmc results for the spin polarized and unpolarized two - dimensional electron gases that do not include a magnetic field and , moreover , provide a single particle spectrum whose physical interpretation is not clear .",
    "nevertheless , lsda has given good results for quantum dots with low electronic densities , having wigner - seitz radius @xmath2 .",
    "these are the typical densities of quantum dots made by etching@xcite or by lithography,@xcite usually over a gaas substrate .",
    "another class of quantum dots are the self - assembled ones,@xcite with high electronic densities ( @xmath3 ) and great practical interest due to technological applications such as , e.g. , in semiconductor lasers.@xcite they are usually formed over inas substrates , have small diameters and contain strongly confined electronic states . for systems so distant from the homogenous conditions one should not expect the lsda to give accurate predictions and , indeed",
    ", most calculations on inas dots have been made using non - dft - based schemes.@xcite    in this paper we employ the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) method@xcite to describe electrons in quantum dots because it yields good ground state energies at a computational cost that grows in a relatively modest way with the number of particles , as compared to ci and qmc ( in its most accurate versions such as diffusion qmc ) .",
    "this method has been extensively applied in the past to study nuclei@xcite and metallic clusters.@xcite also , a related scheme based on bethe - goldstone equations has been used to study small excitonic complexes in quantum dots.@xcite the underlying assumption of bhf theory is a description in terms of independent pairs of particles . for each pair , interaction affects the way in which the two particles scatter , while the rest of particles are considered noninteracting and their influence is only through the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it is well known that the exclusion principle imposed by the fermi sea induces a modification of the pair wave function at short interparticle distances , inducing the so - called `` wound '' in the wave function .",
    "therefore , bhf theory describes short range statistical correlations and will miss , by construction , long range correlations associated with collective motions.@xcite    here we compare bhf energies for electrons in quantum dots with the available results from methods attempting a direct solution of the many body schrdinger equation like ci diagonalization and qmc , as well as with approximate models such as lsda and hf .",
    "we find that bhf is always more accurate than hf .",
    "it recovers the exact result in the strong - confinement limit and at high magnetic fields , when the maximum - density - droplet ( mdd ) is formed , it yields more accurate energies than the lsda ones .",
    "furthermore , in the case of electronic densities typical of self - assembled quantum dots , bhf also gives much better results than lsda even in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "this section recalls some essential points of the bhf theory deriving several relevant equations and quoting others without proof .",
    "the restriction to circular symmetry solutions and its practical implications are also discussed .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath0 electrons with hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the single particle kinetic energy which can include the effect of the magnetic field , @xmath7 the confining potential and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the dielectric constant .",
    "the ground state @xmath10 is solution of the many - body schroedinger equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ground state energy .",
    "let us now consider an independent particle model ( the hf model in the following ) where the eigenstates @xmath13 are slater determinants solutions of the equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the hf potential and @xmath17 a constant .",
    "the hf ground state determinant and energy are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the residual interaction @xmath20 fulfills @xmath21 hf theory yields the following general matrix elements @xmath22 where we have used the standard notation for particle - hole ( ph ) excitations , i.e. , indexes @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) refer to orbitals below ( above ) the fermi energy and @xmath27 is the slater determinant obtained promoting one electron from orbital @xmath23 to orbital @xmath25 in @xmath28 .",
    "note that only 2p-2h excitations yield non vanishing transition matrix elements since the two - body nature of @xmath20 ensures that matrix elements between determinants differing in more than two orbitals will again vanish .",
    "another immediate consequence from eqs .",
    "( [ me1])-([me3 ] ) is that @xmath29 .",
    "we can write @xmath30 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2]),([eq4]),([eq5 ] ) one easily finds that @xmath31 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) by @xmath32 on the left one gets @xmath33 if multiplying by @xmath34 one finds @xmath35 and hence the following implicit equation is obtained @xmath36 this equation can be solved by iteration taking as starting energy the hf one : @xmath37 yielding for the energy @xmath38 at the first order in @xmath20 this equation gives a result for the energy which coincides with the one of first order perturbation theory , summing all the orders we get the correlation energy in the ladder approximation .",
    "this is more clear defining the @xmath39-matrix by the relation @xmath40 we then get the bethe - goldstone implicit equation for @xmath39 : @xmath41 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) @xmath42 only 2p-2h determinants yield a non - vanishing contribution to the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , which can thus be reduced to a sum of two - body matrix elements .",
    "assuming @xmath43 on the right - hand - side , as in the ladder approximation , one has @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are the hf single particle energies and we have associated the @xmath39 matrix with an effective two - body interaction @xmath46 .    in order to have a practical computational scheme",
    "it remains now to specify the two - body matrix elements of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished within the bhf independent - pair model,@xcite where the off - diagonal matrix elements are found from @xmath47 the ground state energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) with the matrix elements obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) is the bhf energy which sums all the ladder diagrams corresponding to the iterated solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .      in this work",
    "we restrict to circular symmetry cases , where the hf orbitals can be factorized as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the principal , angular momentum , and spin quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "in this situation the angular and spin parts of the two - body matrix elements yield selection rules on the corresponding quantum numbers and the matrix elements reduce to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a radial integral that we compute numerically .",
    "note that through eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) the same angular momentum selection rules apply to @xmath54 and that both matrix elements are real .",
    "the two - body matrix elements of @xmath46 required for the evaluation of the total energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , are found by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) as a linear system for the unknowns @xmath55 . for each pair",
    "@xmath56 we have an independent linear system and the above mentioned selection rules are very important since they allow a big reduction in the number of effectively coupled equations . since the space of particle states must be truncated , the convergence of the calculation with the number of empty hf states has to be controlled .",
    "another check of the numerical accuracy must be done regarding the number of radial points used in the evaluation of the integrals @xmath53 of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "table i compares the energies of @xmath57 ground states of @xmath0-electron dots in bhf with the results of hf , lsda ( using the tanatar - ceperley parametrization for the correlation energy@xcite ) and diffusion qmc.@xcite the external confinement is taken of parabolic type @xmath58 , with @xmath25 the electron effective mass .",
    "we refer all energies to the confinement energy @xmath59 and characterize the interaction strength by the repulsion - to - confinement ratio @xmath60 , defined as @xmath61 with @xmath62 indicating the oscillator length ( @xmath63 ) . the results in table i correspond to @xmath64 .",
    "taking , for instance , typical gaas values @xmath9=12.4 and @xmath65 the chosen @xmath60 value would correspond to a confinement energy of @xmath66  mev , which reproduces the experimental value of ref .  .",
    "the number of electrons is varied from @xmath67 to 13 .    at @xmath57 the bhf energies obviously improve the hf ones ,",
    "although they are still appreciably higher than the qmc and lsda values .",
    "this is due to the fact that in bhf long - range collective correlations are missed .",
    "the importance of short range correlations is expected to increase as the system is more tightly confined , for a fixed strength of the coulomb repulsion and , thus , a better performance of bhf is expected when increasing the confinement strength .",
    "indeed , this is shown to be the case in fig .  1 , where for @xmath67 and 6 at @xmath57 we have varied the value of @xmath60 . the lower panels of this figure display the correlation energies , defined as usual by subtracting the hf value @xmath68 from the total energy @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "note that although the correlation energy is globally reduced when the ratio decreases bhf accounts for a larger part of it .",
    "actually , for @xmath67 bhf accounts for 71% of the full ( ci ) correlation energy when @xmath70 and 87% when @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding figures for @xmath72 are 64% ( @xmath70 ) and 75% ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "these numerical results are thus showing that in the limit of small @xmath60 bhf converges to the exact correlation energy .",
    "it can be also seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) that at a given value of @xmath60 , bhf correlations for the @xmath67 dot are a somewhat larger piece of the total correlation energy than for @xmath72 .",
    "we attribute this difference to a more important role of the collective effects leading to long - range correlations not included in bhf for the 6-electron dot .",
    "we focus next on the influence of a magnetic field and how the bhf energies are affected by it . in the symmetric gauge , a magnetic field in the @xmath73 direction ( perpendicular to the dot plane )",
    "induces a modification of the effective confinement from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the cyclotron frequency . for increasing magnetic fields",
    "one then expects short range correlations to be enhanced due to the stronger confinement and , therefore , an improved performance of the bhf method .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays the evolution of the total energy with the ratio @xmath77 for a fixed value of @xmath78 and for a dot with 2 electrons .",
    "note that the correlation energy is about an order of magnitude higher for the singlet than for the triplet.@xcite as expected , for increasing values of @xmath77 bhf is accounting for a higher part of the correlation energy , although the increase is rather moderate .",
    "for the singlet state bhf correlations range from 73% to 81% of the total correlation energy when @xmath76 goes from 0 to @xmath79 .",
    "the evolution is even flatter for the triplet , where bhf correlations remain at @xmath80% for all values of @xmath76 .",
    "note also that due to the sizeable energy correction for the singlet , the singlet - triplet transition point is remarkably improved in bhf with respect to hf .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the evolution with magnetic field of the results for a 6-electron dot with a fixed interaction - to - confinement ratio of @xmath64 .",
    "as compared to the @xmath67 case , this dot shows a much richer phase diagram , with large variations in ground state angular momentum and spin when increasing the magnetic field .",
    "most remarkable is the comparison of bhf and lsda energies : while lsda is clearly superior to bhf at low fields the situation is reversed when entering the fully polarized phase corresponding to the maximum - density - droplet ( mdd ) . in the mdd region",
    "the lsda energy is actually higher than the hf one and only bhf is able to provide an energy correction in the right direction with respect to hf ; total bhf energies being approximately halfway of ci and hf .",
    "all the bhf results shown above have been obtained using a large enough space of empty hf states , always checking that for the given accuracy convergence in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) has been achieved . in practice",
    ", we include the lowest @xmath81 particle states and repeat the calculation increasing this number .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of the bhf energy with @xmath81 , on scale proportional to @xmath82 , for three selected cases : the two upper panels correspond to six and nine electrons with the mdd configuration in strong magnetic field and a moderate confinement , while the lower panel shows the case of four electrons in very strong confinement and zero field .",
    "the results have been fitted with a polynomial including powers up to @xmath83 . in the chosen scale ,",
    "the @xmath84 limit is given by the intersection of the polynomial fit with the left vertical axis .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the convergence is somewhat faster for the moderate confinement cases .",
    "however , in both examples the evolution with space dimension is quite smooth , indicating that the correlation energy builds up by gathering contributions from many states .",
    "the @xmath85 results of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] provide additional support to our preceding conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that bhf performs much better than lsda in the mdd region .",
    "as already mentioned , for strong confinements the bhf energies are close to the exact values .",
    "indeed , the @xmath86 results of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are very illustrative in this respect since the extrapolated bhf energy essentially coincides with the ci result .",
    "this strongly confined system mimics a self - assembled inas dot with @xmath87 mev . following ref .",
    "we take for this material @xmath88 and @xmath89 giving , for @xmath86 , a small wigner - seitz radius of @xmath90 .    to emphasize the possibility of calculating the energies of larger systems in bhf theory we end this section by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the results for an @xmath91 dot . for this number of electrons exact methods like ci or qmc",
    "become extremely demanding and we have not attempted to compare with them .",
    "the evolution of the bhf energy with the number of particle states resembles that of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] although , as one could expect , larger values of @xmath81 need to be considered for a similar degree of convergence .",
    "the proximity of the extrapolated - bhf and lsda energies for @xmath91 is a bit surprising since , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for 6 electrons in the same confinement the difference is larger .",
    "bhf correlations are thus a more important contribution for @xmath91 than for @xmath72 .",
    "this can be understood as a different degree of _ magicity _ for these two dots .",
    "indeed , a highly magic system is characterized by a distribution of single - particle orbitals whose energies group in bunches corresponding to quasi - degenerate shells , with large energy gaps between the shells .",
    "one expects a quenching of independent - pair motions in a highly magic system , with respect to collective motions , and , therefore , a relatively worse performance of the bhf theory for them .",
    "note also that since the @xmath92-electron dot has a higher density than the @xmath93-electron dot , for the same confinement , a better performance of bhf theory in the former agrees with our preceding results regarding the high density limit .",
    "we have explored the prediction of bhf theory for the correlation energy in two - dimensional parabolic dots . rather than attempting systematic calculations we intend to point out characteristic trends when applying a well established many body approach such as the bhf theory to parabolic quantum dots . by comparing with exact calculations",
    "we have quantitatively discussed the relevance of bhf correlations as a function of the confinement potential and applied magnetic field for several quantum dots .",
    "bhf theory converges to the exact correlation energy in the limit of strong confinement potential ( small @xmath60 parameter , high densities ) . also relevant",
    "is the limit of strong magnetic fields where the mdd is formed . in these two regions the standard lsda",
    "is shown to be grossly inadequate while bhf stands as a competitive method that sizeably improves on hf theory . in general , the bhf correlation energy gathers contributions from many empty hf states , as evidenced by the smooth convergence with the space dimension .",
    "possible extensions of the calculations presented here can consider i ) relaxing the circular symmetry constraint , and ii ) including self - consistency in the bhf single particle orbitals .",
    "we shall address the latter by finding the improved mean - field proposed by bethe , brandow , and petschek@xcite that actually implies the solution of a double selfconsistency problem , on orbitals and effective interaction .",
