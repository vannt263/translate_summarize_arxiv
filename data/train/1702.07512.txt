    "the cosmic star - formation history in the early universe has been studied in optical / near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , which trace ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation in rest - frame at high redshifts ( e.g.,@xcite ) . the uv star formation rate density ( sfrd )",
    "does not account for all components of star - forming galaxies ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "recent studies suggest that far - infrared ( fir ) sfrd contributes more than half of the total at @xmath13 ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "millimeter / submillimeter ( mm / submm ) galaxy surveys would be , in principle , efficient to probe the dust - obscured component of sfrd at high - redshift .",
    "the advantage of such observations in mm / submm is the well - known negative @xmath14-correction ; the continuum flux of a typical star - forming galaxy of fixed sfr remains approximately constant with increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "however , it is often difficult to estimate redshifts for very faint and dusty sources ( e.g.,@xcite ) .    strong emission lines such as [ cii]158@xmath15 m or [ oiii ] 88@xmath15 m lines can be used to study the sfr and gas properties of high-@xmath16 star - forming galaxies as well as to determine their spectroscopic redshifts ( e.g. , ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite report that lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath17 show enhancement of [ cii ] emission relative to the fir continuum compared with mm / submm - selected galaxies .",

    "carbon in the interstellar medium is largely in a singly ionised state in a variety of environments , from hii regions to molecular clouds , because the ionization potential of atomic carbon is 11.3 ev , lower than that of hydrogen and close to dissociation energy of co of 11.1 ev ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the critical density of [ cii ] emission is about @xmath18 @xmath19 , and thus [ cii ] emission can arise even in a molecular cloud with temperature around 92 k @xcite",
    ". therefore [ cii ] radiative cooling often dominates in regions with a wide range of densities ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "finally , [ cii ] emission is thought to be a potential tracer of sfr because of its main origin of photo - dissociated region associated with young , massive stars ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "an important observational advantage is that [ cii ] line emission at @xmath20 is redshifted to wavelengths with low atmospheric absorption and thus it is possible to detect [ cii ] line emission even from galaxies at @xmath21 ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",

    "we also check line spectral features of the detected clumps ( sources ) in the datacube separately for those observed in 2014 and 2015 .    for the detected sources , we search for their counterparts in @xmath46 band taken with the canada france hawaii telescope / megacam obtained by archival data @xcite , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , nb912 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 band taken with the subaru telescope @xcite , 3.6 @xmath55 m , 4.5 @xmath55 m , 5.8 @xmath55 m , 8.0 @xmath55 m , 24 @xmath55 m taken with the _ spitzer _ space telescope / irac and mips @xcite 0.5 kev , 2 kev and 8 kev taken with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory @xcite .",

    "overall , the contiguous positive signals over a velocity range of @xmath44 180 km s@xmath2 and the line features commonly seen suggest that the candidates are likely real sources .",
    "we note here that we also detect one clump with @xmath62 in the inverted s / n cube , and thus we would naively be concerned that one candidate with @xmath59 could be a spurious source .",

    "thus we identify adf22-linec as co(9 - 8 ) line emission at @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the optical component near adf22-linec is a known galaxy at @xmath67 @xcite , but we exclude possibility of adf22-linec to be at @xmath67 because there is no obvious line species observed at 1.1 mm .",

    "<S> we report the identification of four millimeter line emitting galaxies with the atacama large milli / submillimeter array ( alma ) in ssa22 field ( adf22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the alma 1.1 mm survey data , with an effective survey area of 5 arcmin@xmath0 , a frequency range of 253.1256.8 and 269.1272.8 ghz , angular resolution of 0@xmath1.7 and rms noise of 0.8 mjy beam@xmath2 at 36 km s@xmath2 velocity resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we detect four line emitter candidates with significance levels above @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify one of the four sources as a co(9 - 8 ) emitter at @xmath4 in a member of the proto - cluster known in this field . </S>",
    "<S> another line emitter with an optical counterpart is likely a co(4 - 3 ) emitter at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the other two sources without any millimeter continuum or optical / near - infrared counterpart are likely to be [ cii ] emitter candidates at @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent widths of the [ cii ] candidates are consistent with those of confirmed high - redshift [ cii ] emitters and candidates , and are a factor of 10 times larger than that of the co(9 - 8 ) emitter detected in this search . </S>",
    "<S> the [ cii ] luminosity of the candidates are @xmath8 . the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of these sources </S>",
    "<S> are estimated to be @xmath9 if we adopt an empirical [ cii ] luminosity - sfr relation . </S>",
    "<S> one of them has a relatively low - s / n ratio , but shows features characteristic of emission lines . assuming that at least one of the two candidates is a [ cii ] emitter </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a lower limit of [ cii]-based star formation rate density ( sfrd ) at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting value of @xmath11 @xmath12 is consistent with the dust - uncorrected uv - based sfrd . </S>",
    "<S> future millimeter / submillimeter surveys can be used to detect a number of high redshift line emitters , with which to study the star formation history in the early universe . </S>"
