    "we found that the scalings predicted by momentum - driven galactic superwinds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "radiation pressure from uv photons generated by massive stars accelerates dust , which is collisionally coupled to the gas , thereby driving galactic - scale winds .",
    "mqt05 formulated the analytical dependence of momentum - driven winds on the velocity dispersion of a galaxy , @xmath16 , deriving the relations for wind velocity , @xmath17 , and the mass loading factor ( i.e. the mass loss rate in winds relative to the star formation rate ) , @xmath18 .",
    "observations by @xcite and @xcite indicate @xmath19 is proportional to circular velocity ( where @xmath20 ) over a wide range of galaxies ranging from dwarf starbursts to ulirg s .",
    "mass outflow rates are difficult to measure owing to the multiphase nature of galactic outflows @xcite , but at least at high-@xmath6 there are suggestions that the mass outflow rate is of the order of the star formation rate in lyman break galaxies  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical advantage of momentum - driven winds is that they do not have the same energy budget limitations as do supernova ( sn ) energy - driven winds , where the maximum is @xmath21 ergs per sn , because the uv photon energy generated over the main sequence lifetime of massive stars is @xmath22 greater @xcite .",
    "od06 found that transforming all sn energy into kinetic wind energy often is not enough to drive the required winds , particularly at lower redshifts .",
    "moreover , galactic - scale simulations find that in practice only a small fraction of sn energy is transferred to galactic - scale winds @xcite . in short , the momentum - driven wind scenario seems to match observations of large - scale enrichment , is broadly consistent with available direct observations of outflows , and relieves some tension regarding wind energetics .    still , for the purposes of studying the cosmic metal distribution ,",
    "the exact nature of the wind - driving mechanism is not relevant ; in our models , what is relevant is how the wind properties scale with properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the inverse @xmath16 dependence of the mass loading factor appears to be necessary to sufficiently curtail star formation in high-@xmath6 galaxies @xcite . at the same time",
    ", they enrich the igm to the observed levels through moderate wind velocities that do not overheat the igm ( od06 ) .",
    "continual enrichment via momentum - driven wind scalings reproduces the relative constancy of @xmath23 from @xmath24 ( od06 ) and the approximate amount of metals in the various baryonic phases at all redshifts  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter do07 ) .",
    "the observed slope , amplitude , and scatter of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation at @xmath25 @xcite is reproduced by momentum - driven wind scalings  @xcite . while only a modest range of outflow models were explored in od06",
    ", the success of a single set of outflow scalings for matching a broad range of observations is compelling .",
    "this suggest that simulations implementing these scalings approximately capture the correct cosmic distribution of metals . hence such simulations can be employed to study an important question that has not previously been explored in cosmological simulations :",
    "_ how do outflows distribute mass , metals , and energy on cosmic scales ? _    in this paper , we explore mass , metallicity , and energy feedback from star formation - driven galactic outflows over cosmic time .",
    "we use an improved version of the cosmological hydrodynamic code gadget-2  @xcite employing momentum - driven wind scaling relations , with two major improvements over what was used in od06 : ( 1 ) a more sophisticated metallicity yield model tracking individual metal species from type ii sne , type ia sne , and agb stars ; and ( 2 ) an on - the - fly galaxy finder to derive momentum - driven wind parameters based directly on a galaxy properties .",
    "the od06 simulations only tracked one metallicity variable from one source , type ii sne , and used the local gravitational potential as a proxy for @xmath16 in order to determine outflow parameters .",
    "these approximations turn out to be reasonable down to @xmath26 , but at lower redshifts they become increasingly inaccurate ; this was the primary reason why most of our previous work focused on @xmath27 igm and galaxy properties . by low-@xmath6 , type ia sne and agb stars contribute significantly to cosmic enrichment  @xcite , and these sources have yields that depend on metallicity @xcite .",
    "our new simulations account for these contributions .",
    "next , using the gravitational potential wrongly estimates @xmath16 especially at low-@xmath6 , when galaxies more often live in groups and clusters and the locally computed potential does not reflect the galaxy properties alone ( as assumed in mqt05 ) .",
    "this tends to overestimate @xmath19 and underestimate @xmath28 , resulting in unphysically large wind speeds and insufficient suppression of star formation at low redshifts .",
    "our new simulations identify individual galaxies during the simulation run , hence allowing wind properties to be derived in a manner more closely following mqt05 .",
    "the paper progresses as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe in detail our modifications to gadget-2 , emphasizing the use of observables in determining our outflow prescription and metallicity modifications .",
    " 3 examines the energy balance from momentum - driven feedback between galaxies and the igm using the new group finder - derived winds .",
    "we follow the metallicity budget over the history of the universe in  4 first by source (  4.1 ) , and then by location (  4.2 ) , briefly comparing our simulations to observables including @xmath29 in the igm and the iron content of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    " 5.1 examines the three forms of feedback ( mass , metallicity , and energy ) as a function of galaxy baryonic mass .",
    "we determine the typical galaxy mass dominating each type of feedback (  5.2 ) .",
    "we then consider the cycle of material between galaxies and the igm , introducing the key concept of _ wind recycling _",
    "(  5.3 ) to differentiate between outflows that leave a galaxy reaching the igm and _ halo fountains _ ",
    "winds that never leave a galactic halo .",
    "we examine wind recycling as a function of galaxy mass in  5.4 .",
    " 6 summarizes our results .",
    "we use @xcite for solar abundances throughout ; although newer references exist , these abundances are more easily comparable to previous works in the literature , and we leave the reader to scale the abundances to their favored values .",
    "we employ a modified version of the n - body+hydrodynamic code gadget-2 , which uses a tree - particle - mesh algorithm to compute gravitational forces on a set of particles , and an entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite to simulate pressure forces and shocks in the baryonic gaseous particles .",
    "this lagrangian code is fully adaptive in space and time , allowing simulations with a large dynamic range necessary to study both high - density regions harboring galaxies and the low - density igm .",
    "gadget-2  also includes physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "star - forming gas particles have a subgrid recipe containing cold clouds embedded in a warm ionized medium to simulate the processes of evaporation and condensation seen in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "feedback of mass , energy , and metals from type ii sne are returned to a gas particle s warm ism every timestep it satisfies the star formation density threshold . in other words , gas particles that are",
    "_ eligible _ for star formation undergo instantaneous self - enrichment from type ii sne .",
    "the instantaneous recycling approximation of type ii sne energy to the warm ism phase self - regulates star formation resulting in convergence in star formation rates when looking at higher resolutions ( sh03a ) .",
    "star formation below 10 @xmath30 is decoupled from their high mass counterparts using a monte carlo algorithm that spawns star particles . in gadget-2",
    "a star particle is an adjustable fraction of the mass of a gas particle ; we set this fraction to 1/2 meaning that each gas particle can spawn two star particles .",
    "the metallicity of a star particle remains fixed once formed ; however , since type ii sne enrichment is continuous while stars are formed stochastically , every star particle invariably has a non - zero metallicity .",
    "the total star formation rate is scaled to fit the disk - surface density - star formation rate observed by @xcite , where a single free parameter , the star formation timescale , is set to 2 gyr for a @xcite initial mass function ( sh03a ) .",
    "even with self - regulation via the subgrid 2-phase ism , global star formation rates were found to be too high , meaning another form of star formation regulation is required .",
    "sh03b added galactic - scale feedback in the form of kinetic energy added to gas particles at a proportion relative to their star formation rates .",
    "they set the wind energy equal to the type ii sne energy , thereby curtailing the star formation in order to broadly match the observed global cosmic star formation history .",
    "sh03b assumed a constant mass loading factor for the winds , which resulted in a constant wind velocity of 484  km / s emanating from all galaxies .",
    "od06 found that scaling the velocities and mass - loading factors as prescribed by the momentum - driven wind model did a better job of enriching the high-@xmath6 igm as observed , while better matching the cosmic star formation history .    we have performed a number of modifications to gadget-2  since od06 .",
    "these include ( 1 ) the tracking of individual metal species , ( 2 ) metallicity - dependent supernova yields , ( 3 ) energy and metallicity feedback from type ia sne , ( 4 ) metallicity and mass feedback from agb stars at delayed times , ( 5 ) a particle group finder to identify galaxies in situ with gadget-2  runs so that wind properties can depend on their parent galaxies , and ( 6 ) a slightly modified implementation of momentum - driven winds .",

    "metal enrichment was tracked with only one variable per sph particle representing the sum of all metals and was assumed to arise from only one source , type ii sne , which enriched instantaneously . while this is reasonably accurate when considering oxygen abundances , the abundances of other species can be significantly affected by alternate sources of metals .",

    "first we consider the mass feedback as a function of time for a star particle .",

    "a second speed limit we impose allows no more than @xmath128 the total sn energy to be deposited into the wind .",

    "the momentum - driven wind model predicts that mass feedback should go as @xmath217 sfr@xmath218 sfr@xmath219 . making the reasonable assumption that sfr@xmath220 as typically found in simulations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the typical mass outflow rate reduces with time for two reasons : first , the star formation rates are lower owing to lower accretion rates from the igm , as discussed in sh03b and od06 and as observed by @xcite .",
    "second , galaxies grow larger with time and the mass loading factors drop ; this even despite the @xmath223 factor that actually increases @xmath28 for a galaxy of the same mass at lower redshift .",
    "hence the outflow rates qualitatively follow the trend seen in observations that at high redshifts , outflows are ubiquitous and strong , while at the present epoch it is rare to find galaxies that are expelling significant amounts of mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : mfunc ] , upper right panel , shows the mass of metals launched as wind particles , which is @xmath224 . for concreteness",
    "we follow the iron mass , although other species show similar trends ; recall that even at @xmath3 93% of iron is produced in type ii sne , and the fraction is higher at higher redshifts .",
    "this relation can be thought of as the @xmath225 relation shown in the upper left panel convolved with the star formation - weighted gas mass - metallicity relations of galaxies at the chosen redshifts , since it is this gas that is being driven out in outflows .",

    "our simulations follow the trend of the toy models in terms of redshift evolution , and show an even tighter agreement at the low mass end versus @xmath87 than the mass feedback ; the metallicity dependence gives greater energies to winds from lower mass , less metal - rich galaxies .",

    "the decline of wind energy feedback for a given mass galaxy toward lower redshift is mostly counterbalanced by more massive galaxies driving more energetic winds at these redshifts .",
    "less massive galaxies unresolved in the l32n256 box are likely to lower this value somewhat , so we only want to conclude that the wind energy is similar to the supernova energy and stays remarkably unchanged with redshift in the @xmath16-derived momentum driven wind model .    to summarize , the momentum - driven wind simulations follow trends expected from the input momentum - driven outflow scalings .",
    "this is of course not surprising , and at one level this is merely a consistency check that the new wind prescription and the group finder are working correctly . but",
    "this also gives some intuition regarding outflow properties as a function of galaxy mass required to achieve the successes enjoyed by the momentum - driven wind scenario .",
    "for example , mass outflow rates should correlate with galaxy mass , and outflow energy in typical galaxies is comparable to , and perhaps exceeds , the total available supernova energy .",

    "the exceptions are the mass outflow rates at @xmath155 , which peak less than 1  dex from these limits .",
    "the changing resolution limit at @xmath156 raises concern whether the evolution above and below this limit is real ; however , the larger amount of evolution between @xmath246 , despite an unchanging resolution limit shows that evolution at @xmath247 is not just a resolution effect .",
    "the median galaxy @xmath89 expelling gas increases by @xmath248 between @xmath241 , for all three forms of feedback .",
    "the vast majority of this growth occurs between @xmath249 , where the median stellar mass increases by @xmath250 in just 2.3 gyr .",
    "this is the epoch of peak star formation in the universe , so it is not surprising that galaxies show the most growth in their stellar masses then .",
    "the baryonic mass ( stars plus gas , not shown ) also jumps significantly , @xmath251 , but early small galaxies are more gas rich making the jump less extreme .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution is much slower in the 10 gyr between @xmath194 as both median @xmath89 and @xmath87 at most triple and usually double in this longer timespan .",
    "this late growth could be an overestimate because of our overestimated star formation rates at late times in the most massive galaxies .",

    "the same growth patterns for star formation - driven feedback are also seen in the median galaxy weighted by sfr , which itself is highly correlated with @xmath87 as @xcite shows using these same simulations .",
    "therefore the changing mass scales of star formation - driven feedback reflect the hierarchical growth of galaxies between @xmath241 , with most growth occurring before @xmath25 .    while it is no coincidence that all three forms of feedback show similar growth rates in median @xmath89 ( and @xmath87 ) , each feedback form has a different mass preference and peaks at a different epoch .",
    "mass feedback preferentially traces smaller galaxies due to the inverse relationship of @xmath28 with @xmath87 .",

    "wind recycling dominates over winds being launched from galaxies for the first time the average wind particle across time is more likely to have already been launched in a wind !",
    "the most important aspect is that wind material , once launched , can not be assumed to be lost from the galaxy forever and remaining in the igm .",

    "the continuous range in the number of recycling times blurs the distinction between a galactic superwind and a halo fountain , and suggests instead there is a continuum .",
    "times by @xmath3 in the @xmath271 @xmath50 simulation is shown by the black histogram ( left scale ) .",
    "@xmath270 means a wind particle is launched only once .",
    "the red line shows the cumulative sum of wind particles launched per bin ( right scale , normalized to 100% ) and is the sum of @xmath272 multiplied by the black histogram added left to right .",
    "50% of winds are particles that have been or will be recycled 3 or more times indicating that wind recycling plays a significant if not dominant role in feedback . ]    the concept of recycling is not unexpected , and has been predicted by @xcite from semi - analytical models .",
    "do07 showed that metals move from mean cosmic density at @xmath25 to an overdensity of 100 by @xmath3 as baryons migrate into larger structures as part of cosmic structural growth .",
    "this means that most of the metals in the diffuse igm at @xmath26 are in galactic haloes at @xmath273 .",
    "metals blown out from early galaxies to low overdensities are later reaccreted in the formation of larger structures , and blown out again . still , the commonality of wind particles being recycled is surprising , especially since momentum - driven winds are almost always ejected at velocities well in excess of the escape velocity of the galaxy .",
    "it is in fact more appropriate to talk about how long it takes a wind particle to be recycled instead of whether it will be recycled .",
    "metals injected by galactic superwinds can not be assumed to remain permanently in the igm ; metals continuously cycle between galaxies and the igm . in an upcoming paper",
    "we will quantify the ages of metals observed at different absorption lines tracing different regions of the igm .",
    "for now we note that the average ages of the metals in the igm are typically much shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "do wind particles generally return to their parent galaxy , or do they jump from galaxy to galaxy ?",
    "the answer is the former ; in the vast majority of cases a wind particle returns to either its parent galaxy or the result of a merger involving the parent galaxy .",
    "95% of recycled wind particles are re - launched from a galaxy of similar or more mass than the previous recycling .",
    "of course galaxies grow anyway under the hierarchical growth scenario , so a wind particle could join a different galaxy that has itself grown larger than its parent . by considering wind particles recycled within 10% of the hubble time , we can diminish the bias of galaxy growth and explore whether winds are traveling from massive central galaxies to surrounding satellite galaxies possibly affecting their dynamics and enrichment histories . with this time limit",
    ", 97% of winds return to more massive galaxies indicating this is a less likely trend .",
    "the number jumps to 99% when considering winds launched from @xmath274 , indicating that it is harder to escape from a more massive galaxy .",
    "furthermore , a wind particle is rarely relaunched more than 1 comoving @xmath48 apart in a 16 @xmath48 test simulation ; the minority case usually involves wind particles following the position of a fast moving parent galaxy .",
    "winds rarely escape forever their parent halo , and winds from large central galaxies do not appear to disrupt satellite galaxies .",
    "another way to quantify wind recycling is using the summed amount of material injected into winds .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath275 , which is the mass injected in winds , including recycled gas .",
    "owing to recycling , there is no limit to how large this can be . using our l32n256 run , we find that @xmath276 i.e. an equivalent of 39% of the baryonic mass has been blown out in a galactic superwind by @xmath3 .",
    "this is significantly larger than @xmath277 due to mass loading factors greater than one as well as recycling .",
    "the other @xmath16-derived wind runs to @xmath3 give different values : @xmath278 for the 8 @xmath48 box with @xmath279 sph particles , and @xmath280 for the 32 @xmath48 box also with @xmath279 particles .",
    "@xmath275 increases by 160% when mass resolution changes by @xmath281 .",
    "this jump is primarily due to a 70% increase in @xmath174 , but still leaves another 50% likely due the varying treatment of recycling at different resolutions .",
    "this lack of resolution convergence raises the question of whether the amount of recycling is set by numerics , perhaps arising from the poor treatment of sph trying to model outflow processes occurring at resolutions below the limit of our simulations .",
    "the discontinuity in recycling rates between resolutions stems from how long and how far a particle reaches once it has been launched .",
    "wind particles in the 32 @xmath48 @xmath50 box with typical masses of @xmath282 are shot at hundreds of  @xmath74 a huge bundle that may be more accurately thought of as a flying wind `` bullet '' .",
    "an actual wind should form a bow shock resulting in a plume of material spreading laterally , but instead in sph this speeding bullet is slowed down viscously through the interactions with neighboring particles .",
    "the number of interacting neighbors over the same physical distance is lower at less resolution , and a wind particle will take longer to slow down ; this is an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of sph .",
    "hence lower resolution simulations inhibit recycling as evidenced by the average number of times an individual wind particle is launched : 3.0 , 2.5 , and 2.1 times for 4.7 , 38 , and 300@xmath283 sph particle resolution ( to @xmath3 ) .",
    "this lack of resolution convergence is quantifiable by the median recycling timescale of wind particles in different resolution simulations as shown in the upper right panel of figure [ fig : recycle ] , and is discussed in the following subsection .",
    "increased resolution suggests that wind recycling should move @xmath275 to an even higher value , probably exceeding @xmath284 .",
    "given that galaxies below a certain mass can not form owing to the presence of an ionizing background , there will be a limit to how high @xmath275 can be ; in the future we hope to run simulations that can achieve such resolutions in a cosmologically representative volume . for",
    "now , the wind recycling predictions should be considered as illustrative rather than quantitative .",
    "we now examine wind recycling as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "specifically , we want to know what galaxies are able to inject their metals into the igm .",
    "the common thought is that low - mass galaxies lose their metals more easily because winds can escape from these galaxies shallower potential wells  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as @xcite showed , if the outflow energy couples efficiently to ambient halo gas , this can yield the mass - metallicity relation as observed , as well as other properties of dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a model in which galaxies expel material at constant velocity ( i.e. the  constant wind \" model of od06 ) does not reproduce the observed mass - metallicity relation , primarily because outflows do not in fact couple their energy efficiently to ambient gas .",
    "instead , the observed mass - metallicity relation  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are better reproduced in the momentum - driven wind scenario . in this case , since @xmath285 ( roughly ) , all outflows have an approximately equal probability of escaping their parent haloes independent of mass , when considering only gravitational interactions with an isolated halo .    the left panel of figure  [ fig : recycle ] shows the virial ratio , @xmath286 , as a function of galaxy baryonic mass , for winds launched at four redshifts . at any given redshift ,",
    "the ratio is roughly constant , but rises slightly at low masses and then declines to higher masses . at low masses ,",
    "the trend arises from the mild metallicity dependence of @xmath19 together with the mass - metallicity relation . moving to higher masses ,",
    "since the potential @xmath38 includes the galaxy potential and the environmental potential of the group / cluster in which it lies , and since massive galaxies live in denser environments , @xmath38 is greater . at the highest masses , our imposed speed limit reflecting the assumption that wind energy can not exceed twice the supernova energy reduces wind velocities .",
    "note that by definition , @xmath38-derived winds will have a constant @xmath158 for a given launch redshift ( modulo wind speed limits ) ; hence the curvature towards high masses is predominantly a reflection of @xmath16-derived winds .    in practice ,",
    "outflows are not only confined by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy ; cosmic infall and hydrodynamic effects can also be quite important .",
    "for instance , @xcite used a simulation of a typical lbg at @xmath135 ( @xmath287 ) to show that metals never reach the igm and instead are confined to the surrounding hot halo gas by infalling gas that creates a shock interface with the outflow .",
    "one way to quantify such additional effects is to consider a new timescale called the recycling timescale , @xmath288 , which is defined as the median time for a wind particle to be re - ejected again as a wind particle , or else fully converted into a star . at",
    "all launch redshifts explored , for all @xmath87 , more than half of wind particles recycle meaning that @xmath288 can be measured .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : recycle ] shows @xmath289 relation , demonstrating a strong anti - correlation of @xmath290 with galaxy mass .",
    "the simple fact that winds recycle on short timescales even though they are launched at velocities well above the escape velocity is an indication that slowing by ambient gas and surrounding potentials is significant .",
    "if the galaxy s gravity is dominant in confining its outflow , one would expect that the time spent away from the galaxy would be approximated by twice the free - fall timescale , @xmath291 ( one @xmath291 outward and another one back in , or simply the orbital timescale for an orbit of eccentricity 1 ) .",
    "@xmath291 scales as @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is the turn - around distance of the wind particle , and @xmath294 is the dynamical mass of the galaxy treated as a point source for the sake of simplicity . following newtonian dynamics , @xmath295 , and the @xmath133 relation for momentum - driven winds",
    ", @xmath291 remains invariant as a function of galaxy mass while @xmath296 .",
    "momentum - driven winds should reach a maximum distance from their parent galaxy that is a constant multiple of the virial radius since @xmath19 scales with the virial energy of an isolated halo .",
    "the strong trend of @xmath288 with @xmath87 indicates that larger - scale potentials and hydrodynamic effects are dominant .",
    "is the particle spending more time in the igm / galactic halo or in the galactic ism before being relaunched ?",
    "the answer is that the vast majority of the time between recycling is spent outside the star forming regions of a galaxy .",
    "this is not surprising , because in our simulations the star formation timescale is tied completely to the accretion timescale ; once a particle is in a galaxy it gets converted to a star or blown out in a wind much more quickly than it was accreted  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we subdivide @xmath288 into two timescales , one leaving the galaxy to reach @xmath293 while being slowed by hydrodynamical forces , @xmath297 and the other returning to the galaxy in approximately one @xmath291 . for simplicity , let s say the hydrodynamic forces slow the wind particle down at a constant rate , in which case @xmath298 .",
    "the total recycling timescale can be approximated as @xmath299 if we assume that @xmath300 and @xmath293 is in physical kpc .",
    "we can now solve for @xmath293 by taking the @xmath288 from figure  [ fig : recycle ] and the average @xmath19 from figure  [ fig : vwind ] .",
    "@xmath293 is just an upper limit for how far wind particles with median @xmath288 can extend from a parent galaxy , because in reality a particle does not likely go out and then immediately fall back into a galaxy in two steps ; wind particles often spend time orbiting around their parent galaxies as well .    in principle",
    ", @xmath293 can be tracked directly in simulations , however our current suite of runs did not output position information of wind particles owing to the large storage requirements .",
    "we have checked for isolated cases that our simple formula ( eq .  [ eqn : trec ] ) yields roughly correct results .",
    "we plot @xmath293 in the left of figure  [ fig : rturn ] , focusing first on the trend over 2.5 decades of galaxy masses at @xmath215 , which we consider here the local universe since trends do not evolve much until @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath293 stays nearly constant from the size scale of dwarf galaxies to galaxies above @xmath2 while @xmath288 declines .",
    "dotted lines correspond to the radius , @xmath301 , of a nfw halo @xcite .",
    "the point at which @xmath293 and @xmath301 intersect is the approximate transition mass below which winds reach the igm and above which winds are confined to their haloes .",
    "metals rarely enter the igm from galaxies above @xmath138 in the local universe .",
    "several significant conclusions can be drawn from this behavior at low-@xmath6 .",
    "first let us consider our wind model and the milky way , which has @xmath302 .",
    "our wind model produces an outflow from a milky way - type galaxy , with initial speeds of a few hundred  @xmath74 .",
    "one might claim that this immediately invalidates our model , since the milky way is not observed to have an outflow . yet quantitatively , our model predicts that a milky way - sized galaxy should have a recycling time of less than 1  gyr , and the typical wind particle will not venture beyond 85 kpc ( if we assume not much has changed between @xmath255 ) . in other words , in our model , the milky way is not driving a classical outflow as seen from local starbursts , but rather is continually sending material up into the halo and having it rain back down on a timescale of 1  gyr .",
    "we call this a _ halo fountain _ , in analogy with a galactic fountain that operates on smaller scales . indeed",
    ", we speculate that there may not be a fundamental difference between galactic fountains and halo fountains , but rather gas is being thrown out of the disk at a range of velocities ; however , our simulations lack the resolution to address this issue directly .    how might such a halo fountain be observed ?",
    "one possibility is that it has already been seen , as high velocity clouds ( hvc s ) .",
    "@xcite predict that given the observed rate of material going into hvc s of about 5 @xmath303 then it should take @xmath304 gyr for all the gas in the ism to cycle through this halo fountain .",
    "hence the galaxy may have an active halo fountain recycling its material on a timescale much less than a hubble time , despite not resembling anything like a starburst galaxy .",
    "the difficulty of observation of feedback within our own galaxy may just indicate how invisible yet ubiquitous galactic - scale winds are .",
    "secondly , with @xmath293 nearly constant , @xmath288 should be proportional to @xmath305 if dominated by @xmath297 and @xmath306 if @xmath291 is larger .",
    "the black dotted line in the right of figure  [ fig : recycle ] corresponding to the latter case ( the steeper of the two ) appears to more closely match the general trends indicating that @xmath291 dominates ; wind particles spend a majority of @xmath288 falling into galaxies ( panel ( b ) in figure  [ fig : rturn ] ) .",
    "our calculations above agree @xmath291 grows larger than @xmath297 for smaller galaxies , but the two timescales are similar for extremely massive galaxies , @xmath307 .",
    "thirdly , smaller galaxies live in less dense environments where hydrodynamic slowing takes longer . to demonstrate this we look at another parameter , the minimum overdensity reached by wind particles , which should approximately correspond to the density at @xmath308 . for the subset of wind particles we track the minimum density achieved before recycling , @xmath309 .",
    "figure [ fig : minrho ] ( solid lines ) shows the median @xmath309 as a function of the baryonic mass of the originating galaxy , @xmath87 , from the l32n256 run .",
    "at all redshifts , smaller galaxies push their winds to lower densities , consistent with them having longer recycling times .",
    "their less dense environments slow winds over a longer @xmath297 , and allow them to reach a similar @xmath293 as more massive galaxies despite lower @xmath19 .",
    "we also plot a long - dashed line that show the average density within 1  comoving mpc sphere around the @xmath215 galaxies .",
    "these show a similar trend , indicating that environmental dependence is the primary factor in how far winds reach into the igm and how long they remain there .",
    "the fact that @xmath310 is much higher than the density within 1 mpc is an indication that these winds are traveling much less than that distance as our calculations above indicate ( @xmath311 kpc comoving at @xmath215 ) .",
    "although a possible explanation for the trend in @xmath309 is larger haloes have higher densities at the same distance , this can not account for the dependence .",
    "the density of nfw haloes decline nearly as @xmath312 beyond @xmath313 resulting in a @xmath314 dependence much steeper than plotted in figure  [ fig : minrho ] below @xmath25 ; for all but the most massive galaxies the density contribution of the parent halo is much smaller at @xmath309 .",
    "the flattening of this relation toward @xmath3 at @xmath315 means these galaxies more likely live in denser environments . for more massive galaxies ,",
    "the parent halo itself is more responsible for the hydrodynamical slowing .     at @xmath215",
    "( black dashed line from l32n256 simulation ) shows the same trend as @xmath316 indicating that environment is the primary factor in how far winds reach into the igm .",
    "the nfw halo profile alone can not explain this trend as halo profiles drop much more sharply and the environmental density dominates for all but the most massive galaxies at low-@xmath6 .",
    "]    finally , small galaxies can enrich a similar volume as large galaxies leading to major implications as to which galaxies enrich the igm .",
    "metals from small galaxies have the advantage of staying in the igm longer , however the disadvantage of their winds being less metal enriched ( e.g. panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : mfunc ] ) .",
    "we plan to look at the origin of igm metal absorbers in a future paper , exploring what galaxies enrich the igm , how long these metals have been in the igm , and what distance metals travel from their parent galaxy .    as a side note ,",
    "we admit that the global sfrd is overestimated at late times ( @xmath317 ) ; the l32n256 run showing nearly 4@xmath13 as much sf at @xmath3 relative to observations ( figure  [ fig : global ] ) .",
    "the primary reason for this discrepancy is the lack of a quenching mechanism in the largest galaxies ; galaxies above @xmath138 account for 54% of star formation at @xmath3 , and their continued late growth creates far too many galaxies above this mass as compared to observations @xcite .",
    "the influence of these over - massive galaxies on the igm however appears to be remote due to their inability to inject metals beyond their haloes and their short recycling timescales .    turning to the evolution of recycling",
    ", @xmath288 grows moderately longer at lower redshift for a given @xmath87 . for a @xmath145 galaxy ,",
    "@xmath288 is 1.1 , 1.5 , 1.6 , and 2.0 gyr for launch redshifts 6 , 4 , 2 , and 0.5 respectively in the 32 @xmath48 box .",
    "this trend is in place despite @xmath158 declining by 1 decade from @xmath240 ( see figure [ fig : recycle](a ) ) ; wind kinetic energy is declining relative to the potential at their launch location .",
    "again , the overriding variable is the slowing of the wind by the environment ; the average physical density declines by a factor of 100 in this interval , making it easier for winds to travel further despite a factor of @xmath318 less energy input into the winds .",
    "galaxies of the same mass are more likely to live at higher overdensities at lower redshift as structural growth makes more groups and clusters , but the declining physical densities and slower hubble expansion of the universe toward low redshift outweigh this .    while the @xmath288 grows at low redshift , the amount of the universe it enriches sharply declines . the calculations of @xmath308 for equation  [ eqn : trec ] shows a moderately increasing physical distance from @xmath240 with values of 56 , 71 , 75 , and 80 kpc for the four respective launch redshifts when considering the same @xmath149 galaxy . however , the comoving volume such a galaxy is enriching is _ 35@xmath13 greater _ at @xmath119 than at @xmath215 .",
    "momentum - driven winds can more easily expel metals into the igm at high redshift , whereas the overdense environments combined with weaker wind velocities and the overall larger scale of the universe leave metals perpetually recycling in halo fountains in groups and clusters at low redshift .",
    "these are the _ primary _ reasons metals migrate from the igm to galaxies as the universe evolves .",
    "our results compare favorably to those of @xcite , who follow energy - driven winds ( @xmath319 and @xmath17 ) in their semi - analytical implementation using a two - phase process for the dynamical wind evolution ( see also @xcite ) . at @xmath3",
    "they also find that it is the smaller galaxies ( @xmath320 , i.e. @xmath321 ) that most efficiently inject their metals into the igm ( @xmath191% of the time ) , while metals from more massive haloes than @xmath322 rarely escape the halo and are recycled ( see their figure 9 ) .",
    "this is despite their @xmath19-dependence ( same as ours but without the scatter ) exceeding the escape velocity .",
    "the redshift dependence is harder to compare to our results due to differing definitions of escaped fractions into the igm , but they do also see smaller haloes , the progenitors to massive galaxies today , as the most efficient enrichers of the igm up to @xmath323 .",
    "lastly , @xmath288 and @xmath309 show similar resolution convergence issues as @xmath275 , for similar reasons .",
    "lines at the same redshift do not overlap in either of these plots , indicating the @xmath288 is longer for the same @xmath87 at lower resolution . as discussed before ,",
    "coarser resolution simulations slows down particles over a longer physical distance allowing wind particles to travel artificially too far at low resolution ; this is why there is less recycling at lower resolution . for well - resolved galaxies ,",
    "the lines of different resolution appear to nearly converge .",
    "the hydrodynamical treatment of wind particles after they are launched is not nearly as resolution - converged as the feedback properties on per galaxy basis ( see figure [ fig : mfunc ] ) .",
    "recycling times are overestimated when under - resolved .",
    "hence recycling times may actually be shorter than we ve shown .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that wind recycling is an important phenomenon for understanding the evolution of galaxies and the igm .",
    "winds from galaxies are typically expelled and re - accreted on timescales short compared to a hubble time .",
    "this occurs despite the fact that winds are typically launched with plenty of kinetic energy to escape its halo .",
    "such gravitational arguments are therefore not very relevant to understand how material cycles through galaxies and the igm ; instead , infall and shocks generated by outflows are more important in setting the wind distribution length- and time - scales .",
    "the recycling time is therefore strongly anti - correlated with galaxy mass , owing to the fact that more massive galaxies live in denser environments .",
    "these denser environments make it harder for winds to travel beyond their parent halo at late times causing the migration of metals from the igm to galaxies from @xmath10 . at the present epoch , small galaxies can still expel material , but larger galaxies are more aptly described as having halo fountains , in which material is constantly kicked up into the halo before raining down .",
    "we introduce a new version of gadget-2 , with improvements designed to explore mass , metal , and energy feedback from galactic outflows across all cosmic epochs .",
    "we add two major modules designed to make the code better suited to explore the low-@xmath6 universe : ( 1 ) a sophisticated enrichment model tracking four elements individually from type ii sne , type ia sne , and agb stars ; and ( 2 ) an on - the - fly galaxy finder used to derive momentum - driven wind parameters based on a galaxy s mass .",
    "we first run test simulations to explore global energy and enrichment properties with and without agb and type ia feedback , and with our old and new wind implementations . focusing on our new (",
    "galaxy mass - derived ) winds including all sources of feedback , we then run several 34 million - particle simulations to explore feedback over the history of the universe and over a large dynamic range in galaxy mass .",
    "we also track a representative subset of wind particles to study in detail how mass , metals , and energy are distributed by outflows .",
    "our new chemical enrichment model enables us to investigate the global production and distribution of key individual metal species .",
    "globally , metal production of all four species tracked ( c , o , si , fe ) is dominated by type  ii sne at all redshifts .",
    "type  ia sne add significantly to the iron content of hot , intracluster gas , especially at @xmath127 .",
    "agb stars add moderately to the igm carbon abundance by @xmath3 , and provide fresh ( enriched ) gas for recycling into stars which increases global star formation at later epochs .",
    "carbon yields from agb stars can not be ignored even at high-@xmath6 , because carbon agb stars enrich on timescales much less than a local hubble time ( i.e. 200 myr-1 gyr ) . due to the complex interplay between instantaneous and delayed recycling from various forms , metallicity patterns in the igm and icm",
    "can not be straightforwardly used to infer the enrichment patterns in the host galaxies responsible for polluting intergalactic gas .",
    "we study enrichment patterns subdivided by baryonic phase .",
    "the total metal mass density is split roughly equally between galaxies and the igm from @xmath8 .",
    "shocked intergalactic gas ( whim and icm ) contains a fairly small portion of the global metal mass at all epochs . at @xmath157 ,",
    "metals tend to migrate from the igm into galaxies , so that by @xmath3 about two - thirds of the metals are in galaxies ( i.e. stars and cold gas ) .",
    "the combination of increased carbon and gas recycling from agb feedback results in the igm being significantly more carbon - enriched , which helps reproduce the relatively high observed mass density in  absorption systems at @xmath207 .    our new galaxy mass - based wind model implementation provides a more faithful representation of the momentum - driven wind model of @xcite , and yields outflows that are in better broad agreement with observed outflows .",
    "in particular , our implementation results in faster winds at high-@xmath6 and slower wind speeds at low-@xmath6 compared to our old local potential - derived winds .",
    "the fast early winds are able to enrich the igm at early times as observed , while the slow late winds mean that most galaxies today are not driving material into the igm at all .",
    "qualitatively , this better agrees with observations indicating that most galaxies at @xmath324 drive powerful winds  @xcite , while today galaxies are rarely seen to have strong outflows .",
    "we examine bulk properties of outflows as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "we find that mass , metallicity , and energy feedback as a function of galaxy baryonic mass roughly follow the trends predicted by momentum - driven winds : @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "the metal outflow rate is @xmath327 , where @xmath328 with a proportionality constant that increases with time as given by mass - metallicity evolution  ( cf .",
    "the stellar mass of the typical ( median ) galaxy most responsible for each particular form of feedback increases by a factor of @xmath329 between @xmath249 , but only @xmath330 from @xmath194 .",
    "each form of feedback traces a different mass scale : mass feedback @xmath331 , energy feedback @xmath332 , and metallicity feedback @xmath333 .",
    "measuring these characteristic masses  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) offers the possibility to test whether momentum - driven wind scalings are followed globally .",
    "the wind energy relative to the supernova energy scales roughly as @xmath11 , and is within a factor of a few of unity at all epochs and galaxy masses .",
    "given expected radiative losses from sn heat input into the ism , it seems that sne will have a difficult time providing enough energy to pollute the universe as observed .",
    "an alternate source of energy would ease this tension , such as photons from young stars whose total energy can exceed the supernova energy by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this adds to the circumstantial evidence supporting the idea that galactic outflows may be driven in large part by radiation pressure , as postulated in the momentum - driven wind model .",
    "we find that _",
    "wind recycling _ , material ejected as outflows and then re - accreted and ejected again , turns out to be a remarkably common occurrence with significant dynamical repercussions . by following individual wind particles in our simulations down to @xmath3",
    ", we find that multiple recyclings are the norm , and that the typical wind particle has been ejected three to four times .",
    "in other words , outflow material being reaccreted onto a galaxy dominates over outflow material launched into the igm forever .",
    "since in our wind model all outflows are launched at speeds well above the escape velocity of galaxies , this indicates that outflows are mainly slowed through hydrodynamic interactions , allowing them to rejoin the hierarchical accretion flow into galaxies .",
    "approximately 20% of the baryons participate in an outflow , but owing to multiple launchings the aggregate mass of baryons ejected exceeds half of the total baryonic mass .",
    "the two key corollaries of wind recycling as seen in our simulations are : ( 1 ) material driven in an outflow can not be assumed to remain in the igm forever , and ( 2 ) gravitational energetic considerations are generally not relevant for determining how far outflow propagate into the igm .",
    "we examine wind recycling as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "the recycling time scales roughly as @xmath334 , as expected if environmental effects are dominating the retardation of outflows .",
    "larger galaxies have shorter recycling times despite launching winds at larger speeds , because they live in denser environments ; the minimum overdensity achieved by winds scales with galaxy mass . as expected from the ubiquity of multiple recyclings , the recycling time is generally fairly short , roughly @xmath335  years , increasing only mildly at lower redshift .",
    "our analysis suggest that winds generally return to the galaxy from which they were launched ( or its descendant ) , though a full merger tree construction is required to confirm this .",
    "it is possible to estimate how far outflows travel from their host galaxies ( @xmath293 ) , as a function of galaxy mass and redshift .",
    "remarkably , @xmath336  _ physical _ kpc at all redshifts and masses .",
    "there are weak trends for higher @xmath293 at smaller masses and lower redshifts ; both are consistent with ambient density being a key determinant for how far winds travel .",
    "the constant physical distance means that outflows at early epochs are able to enrich a significant fraction of the universe , while outflows at later epochs are more confined around galaxies .",
    "this is the reason metals migrate from the igm to galaxies between @xmath10 .",
    "comparing @xmath293 to halo radii , we see that at @xmath155 , typical @xmath2-sized galaxies have outflows that escape their host halos into the igm , while at @xmath127 outflows are generally confined within galactic halos .",
    "this gives rise to the concept of _ halo fountains _",
    ", where low-@xmath6 galaxies are constantly kicking gas out of their ism into the halo but no further , and this material rains back down onto the ism on timescales of order 1  gyr or less .",
    "if correct , then even galaxies not canonically identified as having outflows ( such as the milky way ) may in fact be moving a significant amount of material around its halo .",
    "this halo fountain gas would be quite difficult to detect , as it is likely to be tenuous and multi - phase ; we broadly speculate it might be responsible for high - velocity clouds or halo mgii absorbers  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we leave a more thorough investigation of the observational consequences of halo fountains for the future .    as a final caveat",
    ", it should be pointed out that detailed properties of how outflows propagate out of galaxies are not as well - converged with numerical resolution as we would like .",
    "this may be due to our particular way of implementing outflows in a monte carlo fashion combined with difficulties of sph in handling individual outflowing particles .",
    "here we have focused on qualitative trends that appear to be robust within our limited exploration of resolution convergence , without making overly detailed quantitative predictions . in the future",
    "we plan to investigate how to implement outflows in a more robust way within the framework of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "wind recycling and halo fountains provide two new twists on the idea of galactic outflows .",
    "if our models are correct , then there is a continuum of outflow properties from galactic fountains that barely kick gas out of the disk , to halo fountains that cycle material through gaseous halos of galaxies , to large - scale outflows that are e.g. responsible for enriching the igm . in short",
    ", outflows may be considerably more ubiquitous and complicated than previously thought , and hence understanding their effects on galaxies as a function of mass , environment , and epoch will be even more critical for developing a comprehensive model for how galaxies form and evolve .",
