    "there have been extensive advances in the field of hypernuclear physics .",
    "the conventional @xmath11 strangeness exchange reactions and the associated production reactions of hypernuclei induced by energetic pion , photon and anti - proton beams have been studied experimentally and theoretically in last 30 years@xcite . in the strangeness exchange reaction , the strange quark is brought in by the kaon beam and subsequently transferred to the target to form a hypernucleus . by choosing the incident momentum of the kaon , the momentum transfer can be very small for small @xmath12 angles in this reaction , which favors the formation of low spin states of the hypernucleus .",
    "the use of energetic pion beams for the hypernucleus production was first proposed by dover , ludeking and walker@xcite and further studied by bando et al @xcite .",
    "the associated @xmath13 reaction , in which a pair of s and @xmath14 quarks are produced , is endoergic , so the momentum transfer should be larger than the fermi momentum for a pion momentum with which the two - body @xmath15 cross section remains sizeable .",
    "the experimental studies of the @xmath13 reactions at ags and kek clearly demonstrated the usefulness of this reaction for investigating the excitation of hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "the hypernucleus can also be produced in p - a collisions .",
    "the possibility to produce hypernuclei in the @xmath16 reaction was firstly mentioned by yamazaki@xcite .",
    "the possible associated - production reactions for hypernuclei in p - a collisions include the following types@xcite , @xmath17 reaction 1 ) is a process with a two - body final state and is more suitable for high - resolution studies .",
    "theoretical studies of the @xmath18 reaction were performed for some nuclei .",
    "the exclusive @xmath19 meson production in a proton - nucleus collision , leading to a two - body final state , is investigated in a fully covariant two - nucleon model based on an effective lagrangian picture@xcite .",
    "however , due to the large momentum transfer occurred in the reaction , the reaction cross sections are very small , which makes the experimental study very difficult .",
    "reaction 3 ) is an inclusive process , where the outgoing @xmath19 is measured while the rest of the system in the final state x is unobserved .",
    "some experiments for proton - induced - hypernucleus productions have been proposed in several laboratories@xcite , but the experimental data and corresponding theoretical works are still sparse at this moment@xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath0 hypernuclei was studied in the reaction of the proton with the nucleus , and the lifetimes of the produced heavy hypernuclei were measured by the observation of delayed fission using the recoil shadow method@xcite at cosy . at the same time , the experimental study of the production and decay of hypernuclei in p - a collisions was also carried out at dubna@xcite .",
    "reaction 2 ) is a hypernuclear production process with a three - body final state in the p - a collision .",
    "this reaction was suggested for producing hypernuclei 35 years ago by fetisov@xcite . by choosing the momenta of the outgoing proton and @xmath19-meson",
    ", one can transfer a smaller momentum to the @xmath0 hyperon , which is favorable for the formation of the @xmath0-hypernucleus . in the early work of fetisov",
    ", the cross section of this reaction was estimated in the framework of the plane - wave impulse approximation and the cross section of the elementary process was taken from the early experimental data .",
    "it was found that the cross sections of these reactions are measurable with modern experimental technique .    in recent years , with the development of experimental technologies and methods , the proton beam with a substantially larger intensity is available .",
    "it provides an opportunity to re - examine the hypernuclear production in the three - body - final - state p - a collision . in this paper , we investigate this reaction in the framework of the distorted - wave - impulse - approximation ( dwia ) .",
    "the elementary process @xmath20 is calculated in a fully covariant two - nucleon model , where the effective lagrangian , including contributions from the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 excitations in the intermediate state , is employed .    in section 2 , the theoretical model for the @xmath25 reaction",
    "is briefly illustrated .",
    "calculated results and analysis for the @xmath25 reaction are presented in section 3 . in section 4 the concluding remarks are given .",
    "the production reaction of the @xmath0-hypernucleus in the p - a collision can proceed via a one - step process @xmath26 or a two - step cascade process in which a pion or a @xmath27 is created in the intermediate stage , namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , it is commonly believed that the formation of the hypernucleus in the p - a collision is dominated by the one - step mechanism . based on the one - step mechanism @xmath32 ,",
    "we study the @xmath25 reaction in the framework of dwia . in the reaction",
    ", we assume that the incoming proton interacts with one of the protons in the target and a @xmath33 resonance is excited and followed by its decays into a @xmath19 meson and a @xmath0 particle .",
    "then , by the final - state interaction ( fsi ) between the @xmath0 and the residual nucleus , the @xmath0-hypernucleus is formed .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the @xmath25 reaction are depicted in fig.[feynman ] , where figs.[feynman](a ) and ( b ) stand for the direct process in which the incident proton is excited into a @xmath33 and for the exchange process which corresponds to the excitation of the target proton , respectively .     and @xmath34 reactions .",
    "the elliptic shaded areas represent the interactions in the incoming and outgoing channels .",
    "the rectangular shaded areas stands for nucleon resonances . ]    in the framework of dwia the transition matrix for the @xmath9 reaction can be written as @xmath35 with @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the wave functions of the initial and final states , respectively . @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the wave functions of the target nucleus and the hypernucleus , respectively .",

    "the transition operator @xmath48 can be written as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the interaction for the production of a @xmath19 meson in the collision of the incoming proton with a proton inside the nucleus , which is related to the t - matrix of the @xmath51 reaction in the impulse approximation .",
    "z is the number of protons involved in the production process in the target nucleus .",
    "because the range of the nucleon - nucleon interaction is short compared with the extension of the nuclear wave function , one may assume that the incoming proton interacts with one of the nucleons in the target while the rest of the nucleons remain unchanged , which is a usual way to separate a single nucleon wave function from the many - body system .",
    "then , the transition t - matrix for the hypernucleus production reaction reads as @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the t - matrix of the elementary @xmath19 production in p - p collisions and @xmath54 stands for the transition form factor that takes into account the effects from the distorted waves of incoming and outgoing particles and the wave functions of the target nucleus and hypernucleus . for a simple target nucleus where @xmath55 nucleons stay in the @xmath56-subshell",

    "the total reaction cross sections can be obtained by @xmath100",
    "we first discuss the t - matrix of the elementary process @xmath101 which has been studied by many authors@xcite within the framework of the meson exchange theory .",

    "based on these models , we re - calculate the amplitude of this elementary process by further considering the @xmath108 final - state interaction ( fsi ) @xcite .",
    "in the calculation , the effective lagrangians are chosen as those in refs.@xcite .",
    "the resultant total cross sections for the @xmath109 reaction are plotted together with the experimental data @xcite in fig.[ppkl ] , where the solid and dashed curves denote the results with and without the contributions of the @xmath105 and the @xmath108 fsi , respectively .",

    "what we would like to know in this paper is that if concerned hypernuclei do exist , can we observe them in the @xmath113 reaction and accurately measure their mass spectrum for the study of the hyperon - nucleon ( y - n ) interaction in future . for this purpose ,",
    "we first employ a phenomenological @xmath0-nucleus potential to fit the masses of observed hypernuclei and obtain the bound state wave functions of the hypernuclei which will be studied in this paper . and",
    "then , with these wave functions , we calculate the measurable physical quantities to see if we can achieve our expectations .",
    "as discussed in last section , we assume that the @xmath0 particle interacts with a nucleus core to form a hypernuclear state . the bound - state wave function of the @xmath0 is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with a phenomenological @xmath0-nucleus potential@xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115=28mev , @xmath116fm and a=0.54fm .",

    "same as that used in refs.@xcite , for the light target nucleus , we use the simple single - particle wave function of harmonic oscillator , @xmath118 , to describe target nucleons . for simplicity , we approximately take @xmath119 .",
    "the nuclear distortion effects in the initial and final states are considered by using the eikonal approximation .",
    "we use the form of the harmonic - oscillator density(ho ) for the nuclear charge distribution , @xmath120exp[-(\\frac{r}{a})^2 ] % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the parameters determined from electron scatterings@xcite . again for simplicity , we assume that the distributions for protons and neutrons in nuclei are the same .",
    "the total cross sections of two - body interactions , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , are taken from the experimental data at the corresponding relative momenta of the incident proton and outgoing kaon with respect to the target and residual nucleus , respectively@xcite .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the differential reaction cross section is very sensitive to the form factor , and consequently to the momentum transfer , because the form factor is a function of the momentum transfer .",
    "when the momentum transfer increases , the form factor decreases rapidly .",
    "thus , in order to reach a relatively large cross section for the hypernucleus production in the experiment , the energy of the incident proton should be limited in a range where the momentum transfer has the smallest value .    , @xmath123 and @xmath124 . ]    in fig.[momentumq ] , we show the minimum momentum transfer as a function of the kinetic energy of the incident proton for the reactions @xmath125 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "we find that the minimum momentum transfer decreases with the increasing energy of the incident proton from the threshold of the reaction .",
    "when the kinetic energy of the proton is larger than 2 gev , which is the available energy of the proton beam at cosy and the cooling storage ring ( csr ) at lanzhou in china , the minimum momentum transfer becomes smaller than @xmath126mev / c .",

    "the nuclear density in the ho form is employed for the evaluation of the distortions .",
    "we find that the distortion effects tend to reduce the cross section significantly by a factor of 3 to 10 , and this effect will be more pronounced as the target nucleus becomes heavier .",
    "reaction as a function of the incident proton energy .",
    "the solid and dashed curves represent the calculated results of tcs within the frameworks of pwia and dwia , respectively . ]    in fact , we are not able to detect the hypernucleus directly in experiment . the commonly used method to confirm",
    "the production of the hypernucleus is to detect the other concomitant particles . in the @xmath25 reaction , it is feasible to detect the outgoing proton and kaon .",

    "system for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 target nuclei in dwia are presented in fig.[dcsall ] , where diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) denote the angular distributions for the outgoing proton , kaon and hypernucleus , respectively , and the kinetic energy of the incident proton , @xmath127 , is 2.7gev .",
    ", @xmath3 and @xmath4 target nuclei in the framework of dwia .",
    "the kinetic energy of the incident proton , @xmath127 , is 2.7gev . ]    from this figure , we find that the dcs for the outgoing proton , as well as kaon , is larger at the forward angles , and for the resultant hypernucleus it is larger at the backward angles , because of the momentum conservation .",
    "for the same target , the dcs for the state with the @xmath128-shell @xmath0 is generally larger than that with the @xmath129-shell @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : because the momentum transfer for the reaction @xmath130 is still relatively large at @xmath127=2.7gev , the produced @xmath0 would obtain a larger momentum , and consequently a higher orbital angular momentum@xcite .",
    "then , the contribution from the conversions of the @xmath131-shell and @xmath132-shell nucleons to a @xmath128-shell @xmath0 is larger than that from the conversion of the @xmath131-shell and @xmath132-shell nucleons to a @xmath129-shell @xmath0 . in the cases of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 targets , the dcs of producing",
    "a @xmath129-state hypernucleus is normally smaller for the heavier target ( larger a ) than the one for the lighter target .",
    "this is because that the magnitude of the wave function product @xmath133 becomes smaller with increasing nucleon number @xmath134 .",
    "thus , in the heavier target case , this factor , together with the distortion effect which is relatively larger in the heavier target case , would exceed the effect caused by the increased number of @xmath131-shell proton and make the dcs reduced .",
    "moreover , for different targets , the dcs difference between the @xmath128-shell hypernucleus production case and the @xmath129-shell hypernucleus production case for the @xmath4 target is larger than that for the @xmath3 target .",
    "the reason for this phenomenon is that in the case of the @xmath129-shell hypernucleus production , as mentioned above , the dcs in the @xmath135 , @xmath136 reaction is suppressed in comparison the one in the @xmath137 , @xmath138 reaction . however , in the case of the @xmath128-shell hypernucleus production , the magnitude of @xmath133 for the @xmath135 , @xmath136 reaction is almost the same as that for the @xmath137 , @xmath138 reaction , and the number of the @xmath131-shell proton in @xmath4 is larger than that in @xmath3 , so that the dcs for the @xmath128-shell hypernucleus production in the @xmath135 , @xmath136 reaction is larger than that in the @xmath137 , @xmath138 reaction .    in fig.[ddcsall2d ] , we show the dependance of the double differential cross sections ( ddcs ) on the outgoing proton momentum ( a ) and the outgoing kaon momentum ( b ) , respectively .     and ( b ) the momentum of the outgoing kaon at the angle @xmath139 , in the c.m . system .",
    "the kinetic energy of incident proton is 2.7gev . ]",
    "the results show that for each hypernuclear production case , the ddcs has a gaussian - like distribution with respect to the momentum of the outgoing proton or kaon .",
    "this means that there exist a momentum range of outgoing proton and a momentum range of kaon , where we can find the concomitant particles proton and kaon .",
    "furthermore , when the target becomes heavier , the maximum ddcs point moves slightly to the higher proton momentum and kaon momentum regions .",
    "this enable produced @xmath0 has smaller momentum so that it can be bound on the core nucleus which has less recoil due to its heavier mass . for a clear vision",
    ", we also present the ddcs with respect to the momentum and angle of outgoing kaon , respectively , for the @xmath3 target in fig.[ddcsall3d ] .",
    "-shell hypernucleus and ( b ) and ( d ) for @xmath128-shell hypernucleus . ]    since the final state of the reaction is a three - body state , one can confirm the production of the hypernucleus by detecting the outgoing proton and kaon simultaneously .",
    "we demonstrate the ddcs distribution with respect to the momenta of the outgoing proton and kaon in fig.[ddcspp ]     target nucleus in dwia .",
    "the kinetic energy of incident proton is tp=2.7gev . ]    from this figure , we find that ddcs is distributed in a special range due to the three - body phase space factor , which would be a reference for the experiment .",
    "furthermore , we study the mass and the formation signal of hypernucleus by analyzing the missing mass spectrum in the inclusive reaction @xmath8 .",
    "the invariant missing mass can be defined as @xmath140 . when the produced @xmath0 can be bound on the core nucleus , namely the reaction @xmath130 happens , the discrete peaks will appear in the missing mass spectrum .",
    "the invariant missing mass @xmath141 corresponding to the peak position will associate with the mass of the produced hypernuclear state .",

    "one can see that each of the missing mass spectra contain two parts : discrete lines and a continual curve .",
    "the discrete lines express that the @xmath0 particle is in a bound state with the residual nucleus , namely the final state is a three - body state .",
    "the continual curve is due to the contribution from a four - body final state . in fig.[mxall ] , the dotted curve denotes four - body differential cross sections in each case . in the left diagram",
    ", the single discrete line at the left - handed side of the four - body dcs curve indicates that only one @xmath129-wave hypernucleus state can be produced in the reaction with the @xmath2 target . in the middle and right diagrams ,",

    "the dcs is decreased with increasing nuclear mass , and the dcs for the @xmath7wave hypernucleus production is normally higher than that for the @xmath6wave hypernucleus production .",
    "however , for the @xmath7wave hypernucleus production , the dcs might not be decreased with increasing nuclear mass , due to complicated factors , such as the number of the @xmath6shell protons in the target , the magnitude of the product @xmath133 , and etc .. the ddcs with respect to the momenta and the angles of the outgoing proton and kaon are presented , respectively . the three - dimensional plot for the ddcs with respect to the momenta of outgoing proton and kaon",

    "<S> the @xmath0-hypernucleus production by @xmath1 reactions is investigated within the framework of the distorted wave impulse approximation(dwia ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for the elementary process is evaluated in a fully covariant two - nucleon model based on the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction cross sections for @xmath0-hypernucleus productions on @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 targets are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the distortion effects tend to reduce the cross sections by a factor of 3@xmath510 . </S>",
    "<S> various differential cross sections ( dcs ) and double differential cross sections ( ddcs ) are presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for the @xmath6wave hypernucleus production , the dcs is decreased with increasing nuclear mass , and the dcs for the @xmath7wave hypernucleus production is normally higher than that for the @xmath6wave hypernucleus production . as a reference </S>",
    "<S> , the ddcs with respect to the momenta of the outgoing proton and kaon is also demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the missing mass spectra of the inclusive reaction @xmath8 for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 targets are presented , from which the masses of hypernuclei can accurately be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the missing mass spectrum method is an alternative to study hypernuclear physics . and </S>",
    "<S> the study of hypernuclear physics can be carried out in cosy and csr by the @xmath9 reaction due to the @xmath10b - order reaction cross sections .    </S>",
