    "mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) studies of supernovae ( sne ) have been hampered by a combination of several factors : their intrinsic faintness at epochs of interest , the high background at mid - ir wavelengths , and strong terrestrial atmospheric absorption . with the sole exception of the extremely nearby ( 50kpc ) sn  1987a @xcite , this wavelength region has remained out of reach for sn studies . yet , access to the mid - ir region is important for at least two reasons .",
    "first , a large number of fine - structure lines that are sensitive to the details of the explosion physics lie in the 540@xmath0 m region .",
    "these provide robust measurements of element abundances permitting direct comparisons with explosion models .",
    "second , core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) have been proposed to be major sources of dust at high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but even in the local universe , this hypothesis rests on little direct observational evidence . by monitoring the mid - ir evolution , where warm dust emits most strongly",
    ", we have a powerful means by which we can ascertain the epoch of dust condensation , and estimate the amount of fresh dust produced in the ejecta . alternatively , via mid - ir measurements , we can study the development of an ir echo arising in the pre - existing dusty circumstellar medium , thereby constraining the pre - supernova evolution of the progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the improvements in terms of sensitivity and spatial resolution afforded by the spitzer space telescope ( _ spitzer _ ) finally allow us to probe sn behaviour using mid - ir diagnostics . to this end",
    ", we are pursuing a multi - epoch spectroscopic and photometric campaign of a significant sample of sne of all types , within the framework of the mid - ir supernova consortium ( misc ) . fortuitously , since the launch of _ spitzer _ , at least half a dozen ccsne have exploded within @xmath110mpc .",
    "recently , we presented a first mid - ir study of the nearest ( 3.13mpc ) of these , sn  2004dj @xcite . here , we describe results for the type iip sn  2005af that highlight the diversity of this subgroup .",
    "sn  2005af was discovered in the nearby edge - on spiral galaxy , ngc  4945 , on 2005 feb . 8.22 ( ut ) at v@xmath2 by @xcite . on the basis of a spectrum obtained four days later ,",
    "@xcite classified it as a type  iip ( plateau ) supernova , at an epoch of about one month post - explosion . in",
    "what follows , we assume that the supernova exploded on 2005 jan . 9 , but note that the explosion epoch is probably uncertain by up to a few weeks .",
    "ngc  4945 is associated with the centaurus group of galaxies , and estimates of its distance have ranged from 3.9 @xcite to 8.1mpc @xcite . in recent years , these values have tended to converge near the lower end of this range . following the reasoning in (",
    "* and references therein ) , we adopt a distance of 3.9mpc .",
    "we first observed sn  2005af with _ spitzer _ during cycle  1 using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) and irs peak - up imaging ( pui ) under director s discretionary time program 237 .",
    "we subsequently observed it during cycle  2 as part of our go program 20256 , using the infrared array camera ( irac ) , irs , and irs - pui .",
    "3.68.0@xmath0 m imaging with irac was obtained on 2005 jul .",
    "22 ( 194d ) and 2006 feb . 12",
    "a frame time of 30s and 5 ( medium - sized ) dither positions in mapping mode for each pair of channels were used .",
    "our measurements from aperture photometry , carried out on the post - basic calibrated data , vs14.0.0 image mosaics using gaia , are shown in table [ tab : phot ] . at 67d ,",
    "sn  2005af is very bright in all four irac channels , the flux is particularly bright in channel  2 ( 4.5@xmath0 m ) .",
    "nevertheless , examination of individual bcd frames showed that saturation had not occurred i.e. the measurements are robust .",
    "our first epoch of pui-16@xmath0 m imaging was obtained in peak - up mode only , i.e. , before dithering capabilities were offered with irs .",
    "the two subsequent epochs of pui observations were carried out using 31.46s ramps and 20 small - scale dither positions .",
    "the sn was clearly detected at all three epochs ( table [ tab : phot ] ) .",
    "spectra were obtained on 2005 mar .",
    "17 ( 67d ) and 2005 aug . 11",
    "( 214d ) with the short - low ( sl , @xmath3 m ; r = 64 - 128 ) module of the irs in staring mode . a long - low ( ll , @xmath4 m ; r = 64 - 128 ) spectrum",
    "was also acquired at 67d . for the sl mode ,",
    "the total time - on - source at the two epochs was 1219s and 1828.5s respectively , and 629s for the ll mode .",
    "the first and second epoch data were preprocessed using versions s12.3.0 and s12.4.0 , respectively , of the _ spitzer _ data processing pipeline .",
    "we began the reduction of the bcd data by differencing the two nod positions to remove the background emission .",
    "all subsequent steps , i.e. , straightening , extraction , wavelength and flux calibration were carried out using spice v1.1-beta15 with standard settings the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : irsboth ] .",
    "we also extracted the spectra using post - bcd s13.2.0 products and found that they were virtually identical .",
    "the high irac flux at 4.5@xmath0 m for the first epoch compared to other channels is almost certainly due to co fundamental band emission .",
    "this is corroborated by the steep rise towards 5@xmath0 m in both spectra , which we identify with the red wing of the co fundamental ( see fig . [",
    "fig : irsboth ] ) . between 194d and 399d , the sharpest decline in irac flux",
    "is seen at 4.5@xmath0 m .",
    "these observations suggest that co formed in the ejecta less than 2 months after explosion , persisting to at least 7 months , but had faded substantially by about 1  year .",
    "the relative increase in the irac channel  4 ( 8@xmath0 m ) flux by 399d is probably due to the emergence of spectral features in the 6.439.40  @xmath0 m region spanned by this channel .",
    "this is discussed below .    by day 214",
    ", a pedestal - like feature appears spanning @xmath17.6 - 9@xmath0 m , which we identify with molecular emission due to the sio fundamental band ( figs .",
    "[ fig : irsboth ] , [ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "this is the first time that sio has been detected in the ejecta of a sn  iip ",
    "the most common subtype of all ccsne at low redshifts .",
    "the only other detection of sio in sn ejecta was in the peculiar type ii sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "that molecules are detected at all , provides a diagnostic of the prevalent conditions in the ejecta .",
    "as both co and sio are powerful coolants , they are regarded as precursors to dust condensation in the ejecta ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] we compare an lte model sio spectrum for sn  1987a at 260  days @xcite with the day  214 sl spectrum of sn  2005af . the model , attenuated by a factor of 2.5 , produces a convincing reproduction of the observed behaviour . scaling from the model , the match to our spectrum suggests a sio mass of @xmath12@xmath5m@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite argue that such a mass can only form if there is no mixing of helium into the oxygen - silicon region of the ejecta .",
    "apart from molecular emission , several conspicuous lines are visible in both spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irsboth ] ) which were identified by analogy with sn  1987a @xcite . at both epochs ,",
    "the spectrum is dominated by forbidden lines of ni , co , and ar , of which the [ niii ] 6.64@xmath0 m , [ arii ] 6.99@xmath0 m , and [ coii ] 10.52@xmath0 m are the most prominent .",
    "between 67d and 214d the lines show appreciable increases in intensity ( see table [ tab : intensities ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : irsboth ] ) , in addition , in spite of the low spectral resolution ( r=64 - 128 ) , we observe in a number of lines ( e.g. , [ niii ] @xmath76.64@xmath0 m , [ coii]@xmath7 10.52@xmath0 m ) an extended red wing at 67d which fades by 214d .",
    "the broad blend with an extended red wing near 11.3@xmath0 m at 67d is probably due to a combination of [ nii ] and hi ( 7 - 9 ) , but by 214d , it is symmetric .",
    "extended red wings were also detected in several lines in sn  1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) accompanied by small redshifts of the line centroid . a plausible explanation is provided by electron scattering in the expanding hydrogen envelope @xcite",
    "this may also apply to sn  2005af , although we do not detect any obvious redshifting of line centroids .",
    "we now estimate the abundances from the stronger lines at the later epoch when the ejecta has a lower optical depth .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the electron density of the ejecta as @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 at day 214 .",
    "we derived critical densities for ni@xmath11 and ar@xmath11 using collision strengths from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and found these to be 1 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "on this basis , we deem an lte treatment to be valid .",
    "using the line intensities in table [ tab : intensities ] , we derive masses using the upper excited state populations of the ions and find 3.7@xmath13 , 1@xmath13 , and 2.2@xmath13 for stable ( ni@xmath14,ni@xmath15 ) , ar@xmath15 , and ne@xmath15 respectively , for an electron temperature of 4000k . note that the result is insensitive to temperature : a @xmath161000k change in temperature , changes the mass estimates by @xmath1715% .",
    "the partition functions are from @xcite for ni , and @xcite for ar and ne . assuming a uniform distribution of stable ni , we find that the sobolev optical depths of all detected ni lines are less than 0.06 . strong transitions of [ niiii ] 11.002@xmath0 m and [ niiv ] 8.405@xmath0 m lie within the wavelength region covered , but these lines are not detected at either epoch .",
    "we conclude that the ni is predominantly in the neutral and singly - ionised state .",
    "thus , assuming insignificant clumping , the value we derive above is probably close to the total stable ni mass .",
    "the predicted mass of stable ni is sensitive to the progenitor mass , although this relation is not monotonic , and depends sensitively on the explosion mechanism , multi - dimensional effects and , in spherical models , on the mass cut , which is a free parameter .",
    "@xcite predict stable ni masses in the range 0.010.014@xmath18 for progenitors in the range 13 - 20@xmath18 , and a much lower value of 0.002@xmath18 for a 25@xmath18 star .",
    "other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) derive comparable values , though detailed intercomparisons are difficult due to different parametrizations of physical processes .",
    "@xcite provide explosive yields as a function of metallicity based on parameters which have been calibrated to fit observed properties of massive stars .",
    "the value for the stable ni mass that we derive is closest to their progenitor models of 13 - 15@xmath19 with metallicities of a third to a twentieth of the solar value .",
    "although we can definitively rule out higher mass progenitors at even lower metallicities , we current can not exclude a 35@xmath19 progenitor at solar metallicity .",
    "further , planned , late - time spectroscopy should provide tighter constraints .",
    "given the high energy required to ionise neutral ne ( 21.6ev ) and ar ( 15.8ev ) we conclude that , given the low ionisation conditions indicated by ni , the bulk of the ne and ar lies in the neutral state .",
    "however , no strong transitions of [ nei ] or [ ari ] lie in our wavelength range .",
    "consequently , the masses derived here for the first ionisation state represent lower limits only . for sn  1987a at 260  days , using the [ coii ] 10.52@xmath0 m line ,",
    "@xcite derive a value for @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "using our day 214 intensity for this line in sn  2005af we obtain @xmath20 = @xmath22 . allowing for the different epochs for the two sne , this implies that a @xmath23ni mass of 0.027@xmath19 was ejected by sn  2005af .",
    "this estimate falls in the expected range for normal type  ii sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although we have a clear detection of the sn  2005af spectrum between 16 - 30@xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irsboth ] )  the first , for any sn at this early epoch ",
    "we do not see any significant spectral features .",
    "this is not surprising , given its youth .",
    "in sn  1987a , lines of [ feii ] in this spectral region were only detected after @xmath1400d @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] we compare roughly coeval mid - ir spectra of sn  2005af with that of sn  1987a ( iipec ) at @xmath160d , and with those of sn  1987a and sn  2004dj ( iip ) at @xmath1250d .",
    "the 60d mid - ir spectrum of sn  1987a is dominated by hi lines ( see fig . [ fig : compare ] or * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , strong lines of [ niii ] and [ arii ] are present in sn  2005af .",
    "this suggests either that our first - epoch sn  2005af observations were taken on the radioactive tail of the lightcurve and that the length of the plateau phase must have been @xmath1760d , or that the estimated explosion date , based on the classification spectrum is too late by @xmath241 month .    at the later epoch",
    "all three sne exhibit prominent lines of nickel and cobalt . @xcite emphasize that the ratio of [ nii]7.5@xmath0 m to [ niii]6.64@xmath0 m lines provides a sensitive measure of the ionization fraction of ni ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "using their fig .",
    "9 , and assuming lte , we find @xmath26 and 0.85 for sn  2004dj , sn  2005af , and sn  1987a , respectively , at @xmath1250d .",
    "sn  2005af shows much stronger [ arii ] than sn  1987a .",
    "moreover , sn  2004dj is found to be a factor of 20 weaker than sn  2005af in this line .",
    "even if we normalise to the strengths of the adjacent [ niii]6.63@xmath0 m , [ nii]7.50@xmath0 m lines , the [ arii ] line is still over @xmath275 stronger in sn  2005af .",
    "this is intriguing given that sne  2004dj and 2005af are both of type  iip .",
    "one possibility , indirectly implied by @xmath28 above , is that the conditions required to ionize ar are not attained in sn  2004dj , while ni@xmath15 , with its lower ionization potential ( 7.6ev ) , is easier to produce .",
    "another hint may come from the spherically symmetric @xcite models , where the bulk of the stable ar ( mostly @xmath29ar ) is formed in a shell just above the stable ni region .",
    "thus , one might expect that a higher mass cut ( below which the core collapses to a neutron star or black hole ) within the ni zone would produce a lower absolute ni mass , but a higher ar / ni mass ratio .",
    "however , this seems to be contrary to what we observe , i.e. , sn  2004dj has an apparently smaller ni mass but an even smaller ar / ni mass ratio than sn  2005af .",
    "we suspect that to account for this behaviour , a certain degree of asymmetry or clumpiness , as well as mixing in the ejecta has to be invoked .",
    "interestingly , @xcite infer an overall asphericity of 20% for sn  2005af from optical polarimetry .",
