    "the electronic state of many materials with partially filled d- or f - shells , as well as molecular solids , is characterized by strong correlations . picturing their wave - function as a determinant of single - particle states",
    "does not properly account for their physical properties .",
    "materials with strong electronic correlations display fascinating phenomena , often with a large amplitude , such as metal - insulator transitions , high - temperature superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance , a large thermoelectric power , or carriers with a large effective mass and reduced spectral weight .",
    "the mott phenomenon - the localization of electrons due to the strong coulomb repulsion and the reduced bandwidth - has emerged as a central paradigm in this field  @xcite .",
    "the parent compounds of high - temperature cuprate superconductors are widely considered to be mott insulators ( of the so - called ` charge - transfer ' type ) .",
    "the metallic and superconducting states emerge by doping this insulator with charge carriers . in this view , strong electronic correlations in the metallic state are due to the proximity of the mott insulator .",
    "hence ` mottness ' is widely regarded as being key to the strong correlations observed in oxides and organic compounds .",
    "cuprates have a single active electronic band at the fermi - level , a rather unique property which incidentally is also shared by the organic superconductors of the bedt family .",
    "with very few exceptions , known oxides of other transition metals are in contrast multi - band materials , and so are the recently discovered iron - based superconductors .",
    "several bands cross the fermi level , formed by the different orbitals of the transition - metal @xmath2-shell hybridizing with ligands  @xcite .",
    "many of these multi - orbital materials , such as ruthenates and iron pnictides and chalcogenides , are metals which display clear signatures of strong correlations while not being close to a mott insulating state .",
    "this raises a puzzling question : what is the physical origin of electronic correlations in these materials ?    in the last few years , there has been increasing awareness that hund s coupling may be responsible for these effects .",
    "hund s coupling is the energy scale associated with intra - atomic exchange , which lowers the cost in repulsive coulomb energy when placing two electrons in different orbitals with parallel spin , as opposed to two electrons in the same orbital  @xcite .",
    "this shakes the paradigm establishing ` mottness ' as the unique origin of strong correlations , and highlights that another class of strongly correlated but itinerant systems have physical properties distinctly different from doped mott insulators . the term ` hund s metals ' has been coined in ref .",
    "@xcite to designate such materials .",
    "there are two distinct effects of the hund s rule coupling .",
    "the first is a high - energy effect . as emphasized early on  @xcite , the effective coulomb repulsion for an isolated atom",
    "is increased by hund s coupling for a half - filled shell , while it is decreased for all other fillings .",
    "the second is a low - energy effect , revealed in early studies of a single impurity atom coupled to a conduction electron gas ( the kondo problem ) . for a multi - orbital shell",
    ", the characteristic temperature below which screening of the atomic degrees of freedom takes place is considerably lowered by hund s coupling  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the quenching of orbital momentum and associated loss of exchange energy , and explains the sensitive dependence of the kondo temperature on the size of the impurity spin  @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable is that these effects , documented for an isolated atom or for a single atomic impurity in a metallic host , continue to play a crucial role in the context of itinerant systems with a bandwidth significantly larger than hund s coupling . that this is the case has been demonstrated in several recent studies , which led to the realization that ` hundness ' is the key explanation of electronic correlations in several families of metallic systems .",
    "two remarkable theoretical studies , in the context of a 5-band description of the metallic state of iron pnictides  @xcite and in that of a 3-band multi - orbital hubbard - kanamori model  @xcite , revealed that the low - energy quasiparticle coherence scale is considerably reduced by hund s coupling . such a reduction was also emphasized in the context of ruthenates in ref .",
    "this leaves an incoherent metallic state with frozen local moments in an extended temperature range above the coherence scale , for which the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite coined the term ` spin - freezing ' regime .",
    "these authors also discovered that this regime displays non - fermi liquid properties of the self - energy , characterized by a power - law behaviour .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the influence of hund s coupling on the energetics of charge - transfer in an isolated atom has important consequences for the mott critical coupling in a solid . the generic effect ( when orbital degeneracy is preserved ) is that non half - filled materials are driven further away from the mott insulating state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a global picture was proposed , which also shows how to place many different materials on a map parametrized by the interaction strength and the filling of the shell .",
    "it was emphasized there that the two key effects compete with one another in the generic case of a non half - filled shell : hund s coupling drives the system away from the mott transition but at the same time makes the metallic state more correlated by lowering the quasiparticle coherence scale . like the roman god janus",

    "[ fig : zcontour],width=566 ]    at a fundamental level , a key lesson is that intra - atomic correlations play a crucial role even in itinerant systems with relatively broad bands and moderate hubbard repulsion , such as transition - metals of the 4d and 5d series or iron pnictides and chalcogenides .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite is currently the most appropriate theoretical framework to deal with these issues , since it handles band - like and atomic - like aspects on equal footing .",
    "in contrast to more conventional approaches picturing a solid as an inhomogeneous electron gas to which interactions are added perturbatively , dmft emphasizes local many - body correlations by viewing a solid as an ensemble of self - consistently hybridized atoms .",

    "[ sec : ruthenates ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : pnictides ] consider ruthenates and iron pnictides / chalcogenides , respectively , in the perspective of hund s metals .",
    "in 1925 , in an article dealing with the spectra of transition - metal atoms  @xcite , friedrich hund formulated a set of rules specifying the ground - state configuration of multi - electron atomic shells . for @xmath11 electrons in a shell with orbital degeneracy @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , the rules state that :",
    "* total spin @xmath14 should first be maximized ( rule of ` maximum multiplicity ' ) * given @xmath14 , total angular momentum @xmath15 should be maximized * finally , the lowest @xmath16 should be selected for @xmath17 ( less than half - filled shell ) and the highest @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "for example a d - shell with 3 electrons will have @xmath20 ( e.g. @xmath21 ) , with 6 electrons @xmath22 ( e.g. @xmath23 ) , while the half - filled shell with 5 electrons ( e.g. @xmath24 ) has @xmath25 and a fully quenched angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "these rules are sometimes referred to as the ` bus - seat ' rule : singly - occupied spots are filled first , then double occupancies are created when singly - occupied spots are no longer available .",
    "the origin of these rules is traditionally attributed to the minimization of the coulomb interaction between electrons . for two electrons for example ,",
    "the first rule ( s=1 rather than s=0 ) forces an antisymmetric wave - function of the radial part , so that ` electrons are further apart ' . in quantum - mechanical terms , the energy gain associated with hund s rule is the intra - atomic exchange energy  .",
    "the third rule is associated with spin - orbit coupling , which we shall not consider in this paper although its physical effects have attracted considerable attention recently .    to illustrate these rules in a more quantitative form appropriate to the solid - state context of this article ,",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian describing the triplet of orbitals with lowest energy of a transition - metal ion in a cubic crystal field with an octahedral environment .",
    "the case of two orbitals and an doublet is considered in details in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] . for both and",
    ", there are only three independent coulomb integrals , which are matrix elements of the _ screened _ coulomb interaction in appropriately chosen wavefunctions of the orbitals in the solid : @xmath27 indeed , the wave functions can be chosen real ( so that the ` spin - exchange ' and ` pair - hopping ' integrals are equal @xmath28 ) , and all other terms in the interaction tensor , e.g. of the type @xmath29 vanish by symmetry in this case . because there are no other exchange integrals involved , the full many - body atomic hamiltonian for states takes the kanamori form  @xcite : @xmath30 the first three terms involve only density - density interactions , between electrons with opposite spins in the same orbital ( @xmath3 ) , opposite spins in different orbitals ( @xmath31 ) and parallel spins in different orbitals .",
    "the latter case has the smallest coupling @xmath32 , reflecting hund s first rule . for later use",
    ", it will be useful to consider a generalization of this kanamori multi - orbital hamiltonian to a form in which all coupling constants are independent : @xmath33 defining the total charge , spin and orbital isospin generators ( @xmath34 are the pauli matrices ) : @xmath35 the generalized kanamori hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_kanamori_general ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath36 it thus has full @xmath37 symmetry provided @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in which case the hamiltonian reduces to the first line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_t2g_general_nsl ] ) .",

    "this accounts for the @xmath123 curie - weiss susceptibility even though strict osmt may not occur .",
    "in fact , at higher temperatures , a @xmath123 moment is observed in an extended range @xmath135 .",
    "below @xmath122 when the octahedra also tilt , the @xmath75-derived bands narrow down and the corresponding correlations increase , as perhaps indicated by the build - up of incommensurate magnetic fluctuations .",
    "these qualitative ideas call for a detailed study using lda+dmft techniques .",
    "the poorly screened moments are susceptible to ordering at low temperature .",
    "close to the @xmath122 critical point , nakatsuji et al  @xcite found a history - dependent magnetization compatible with the build - up of short - range ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the phase diagram has very recently been refined in a @xmath136 study , which revealed subtle signatures of spin - glass ordering with moments below @xmath137@xmath138 at most ca concentrations  @xcite .",

    "the transition temperature diminishes with increasing @xmath121 and vanishes a bit below @xmath127 . only the rotations and tilts",
    "are not sufficient to turn a ruthenate insulating , a compression of the octahedra realized in the s - pbca phase which completely polarizes the orbitals is needed .",
    "the recent discovery of high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite in iron pnictides and chalcogenides , has generated considerable interest ( for reviews see e.g. refs .",
    "obviously in the limited space of this article we will not attempt to cover the intensive research performed on the subject .",
    "we will rather focus on the importance of the hund s coupling for the physics of these compounds .",
    "right from their discovery , the degree of electronic correlation in these materials has been debated , with views ranging from the itinerant limit with magnetic correlations induced by nesting  @xcite , all the way to localized magnetism  @xcite .",
    "the importance of electronic correlations while keeping a metallic description has been emphasized early on in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    in our view ,",
    "it has now become clear that these materials do display important effects of electronic correlations . from a phenomenological standpoint ( looking for example at the drude weight , specific heat enhancement , renormalization of bandwidth and fermi velocities , etc . ) , the degree of correlation clearly increases when going over the different materials , in the order ( from weaker to stronger correlation effects ) : 1111 pnictides ( such as lafeaso ) , 122 ( such as ) , 111 ( such as lifeas ) and , at the more strongly correlated end  @xcite , the 11 chalcogenides ( fese , fete ) .",
    "an issue which is still controversial is whether these differences are mainly due to variations in the structural properties with similar interaction strengths ( @xmath141 ) @xcite or whether it is essential to take into account an increase of the interactions , especially for the 11 chalcogenides @xcite . by and large ,",
    "the big picture is nonetheless that the correlations are important .",
    "the key role of the hund s coupling has been recognized early on for these materials . in a pioneering article , haule and kotliar",
    "@xcite proposed that hund s coupling may indeed be responsible for the correlation effects and thus for the unconventional aspects of the metallic state .",
    "within 5-bands lda+dmft calculations , they found that the hund s coupling dramatically reduces the coherence scale @xmath83 below which a metal with pauli susceptibility is found , leaving an incoherent metal with local moments for @xmath142 ( see fig.[fig : pnictides]a ) .",

    "[ fig : pnictides],width=566 ]    it was also recognized early on @xcite that the hund s coupling is responsible for the formation of the iron - local moment in these compounds .",
    "this is consistent with x - ray spectroscopy  @xcite which reported a large value of @xmath147ev .",
    "unexpectedly , in the magnetic state , the lsda was found to overestimate the size of the ordered magnetic moments ( @xmath148 , whereas experiments yield moments @xmath149 ) .",
    "the lda being a static theory , a possible way of interpreting this is that magnetic moments undergo important dynamical fluctuations . indeed , in refs .",
    "@xcite , hansmann and coworkers performed lda+dmft calculations of the local spin - spin correlation function @xmath150 in the paramagnetic phase and looked at the short - time ( high - energy ) fluctuating local moment , finding that its instantaneous value @xmath151 is rather large but rapidly decays ( after typically a few femtoseconds ) due to the screening in a metallic environment .",

    "liu et al .",
    "@xcite report a smaller value @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) for . can be probed by neutrons and its integral can be related to the value of the moment . however , because neutrons only reach frequencies of order a few @xmath158mev s which is an order of magnitude too low , reduced values of the moment can be expected from such experiments . ]",
    "the @xmath159 they find is compared to lda+dmft calculations and the agreement supports the notion of a local moment formed at a high - energy , with little influence of doping on the high - energy spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the maximum of @xmath144 was found to be at @xmath160  mev , corresponding to a fluctuation time - scale of @xmath161 .",
    "note that this energy scale ( resp .",
    "time - scale ) is an order of magnitude smaller ( resp .",
    "longer ) than the bare electronic bandwidth ( @xmath162  ev ) .",
    "indeed , a weak - coupling itinerant picture based on an rpa calculation  @xcite would yield a time - scale about 10 times shorter and vertex corrections were found to be crucial ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pnictides]b ) . experimental support for the formation of a sizeable fluctuating local moment at high - energy also stems from from fast spectroscopic probes such as x - ray absorption  @xcite and core - level photoemission  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the hund s coupling in properly accounting also for the magnetic long - range order of these compounds   has been emphasized by theoretical studies both from the strong coupling  @xcite and weak coupling viewpoints  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , it has first been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hund s coupling , besides causing moment formation at high - energy , is also responsible for the low energy correlation effects in the metallic phase of these compounds , hence making them ` hund s metals ' ( a term coined in ref .",
    "this point of view has been further confirmed and elaborated upon in several theoretical studies , mostly based on the lda+dmft methodology .",
    "aichhorn and coworkers@xcite and liebsch and ishida@xcite found that the chalcogenide fese displays local moments down to low temperature , together with ` bad metallic ' behaviour characterized by a large scattering rate for some of the orbitals .",
    "this is a manifestation of the ` spin - freezing ' behaviour discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin_freezing ] .",
    "these calculations also reveal a strong tendency to orbital differentiation ( present in all materials but more pronounced for the chalcogenides  @xcite ) , with the -like orbitals more correlated than the ones ( see below ) .",
    "the importance of hund s coupling for lifeas was also emphasized recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the non - fermi liquid power law regime associated with the onset of the spin - freezing behaviour ( sec .",
    "[ sec : spin_freezing ] ) has been revealed very clearly in a recent study of doped  @xcite .",
    "the crossover line between the fermi - liquid and non - fermi liquid power - law behaviours found by these authors as a function of doping and temperature is reproduced in fig.[fig : pnictides]c .",
    "very recently , such power - laws have been reported and discussed for chalcogenides as well  @xcite .",
    "based on these studies and on the general considerations presented earlier in this article , one may want to position the different fe - based material on a diagram similar to the one of fig .",
    "[ fig : zcontour ] , as a function of the filling of the d - shell and strength of interaction , see fig.[fig : pnictides]d .",
    "it is seen that hole - doping takes these materials deeper into the strongly correlated spin - freezing regime and electron doping restores a more itinerant fermi liquid behaviour . with this perspective in mind",
    ", some authors have recently pictured the hole - doped materials as being in the proximity of the @xmath163 mott insulating state i.e as derived from this insulator by electron doping  @xcite .",
    "we note in this respect that the mn - based materials , with nominal @xmath163 composition , are indeed insulators  @xcite , as expected from the much lower value of @xmath7 for a half - filled shell .",
    "insights into the qualitative difference between mott - correlated and hund - correlated metals have been obtained within lda+dmft by focusing on atomic histograms  @xcite .",
    "these histograms register the probability of occurrence of each atomic state , resolved with respect to the atomic charge and the energy of the state . they reveal that charge fluctuations are substantial in these materials , in contrast to a metal close to a mott transition in which valence fluctuations are suppressed . here in contrast , the probability is highest for @xmath164 and @xmath165 states , is still sizeable for @xmath166 and non - negligible for @xmath167 states .",
    "furthermore , within a given @xmath11 the high - spin atomic ground state has the largest probability  @xcite , but other states are also often visited , unlike in heavy fermions .",
    "it is also argued  @xcite that , since the most probable @xmath164 and @xmath165 states span an energy range of over 6ev , this broadens the atomic excitations ( hubbard bands ) and makes them difficult to be resolved in photoemission spectroscopy , explaining why they are actually not observed .",
    "these considerations highlight the itinerant nature of these systems , yet dominated by the correlation effects due to hund s rule coupling .",
    "note that valence fluctuations on individual sites imply a corresponding change of the local effective interaction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mottgap],@xcite ) .",
    "local aspects of this physics are fully taken into account by dmft , but inter - site correlations may also play a role and require a treatment beyond single - site dmft .    on the experimental side ,",
    "optical measurements have been interpreted as revealing the importance of the hund s rule coupling . besides a reduction of the drude weight and thus of the electron kinetic energy  @xcite which testifies for correlations , optical measurements on show that the spectral weight @xmath168 is suppressed upon cooling down around @xmath169  @xmath170 , the lost spectral weight being recovered above @xmath171  @xmath170 .",
    "this energy scale , first reported in hu et al .",
    "@xcite , is interpreted as a signature of hund s coupling  @xcite .    soon after the discovery of high-@xmath57 superconductivity in iron pnictides it was also pointed out  @xcite that the general features of the electronic structure of these materials constitute an ideal ground for orbital - selective physics caused by electronic correlations , and for the formation of localized magnetic moments coexisting with metallic properties .",
    "an important mechanism is the role of `` band - decoupler '' played by the hund s coupling , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : osmt ] .",
    "indeed several theoretical studies  @xcite have reported strong orbital differentiation ( e.g. in the degree of coherence ) , in particular in the arguably more strongly correlated iron chalcogenides , or in pnictides for correlation strengths somewhat larger than the physical estimate@xcite .",
    "in general , @xmath77 orbitals in these calculations show stronger mass enhancements and lower coherence than the @xmath85 s . in parallel , phenomenological models based on the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons were developed in order to explain the magnetic and superconducting properties of iron pnictides  @xcite and their evolution under pressure  @xcite .",
    "note however that there is not necessarily a direct connection between these two components ( localized and itinerant ) and the two types of orbitals ( , ) .",
    "superexchange between well - formed local moments has been suggested as an explanation for both the collinear af order coexisting with metallic properties , and the linear dependence on temperature of the magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase ( although ref .",
    "@xcite reproduces this behaviour , already in a purely local picture , due to orbital differentiation ) .",
    "fluctuating local moments also hint at a possible pairing mechanism for superconductivity through spin fluctuations .    on the experimental side ,",
    "several evidences for the coexistence of local moments and itinerant electrons have been reported .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering on fete@xmath172se@xmath173  @xcite show a significant temperature independent magnetic moment ( obtained by integrating the magnetic spectral weight up to 12mev ) , indicating that a large energy scale ( i.e. states at an energy much larger than the temperature ) is involved in the formation of this moment . a picture based on itinerant ( albeit renormalized )",
    "electrons alone can not explain such a magnetic response .",
    "analogously , nuclear magnetic resonance data on fese@xmath174se@xmath175 @xcite show a knight shift scaling with the local spin susceptibility measured by electron paramagnetic resonance and not with the bulk magnetic susceptibility , an evidence interpreted as arising , in pure single crystalline samples , from intrinsically localized states coupled to quasiparticles .",
    "arpes measurements of the fermi velocity in each fermi surface sheet , in the arguably less correlated potassium - doped reported orbital dependent mass renormalizations  @xcite . accordingly , a model of two electronic fluids with different coherence properties was needed to interpret the magnetoresistance data in the cobalt - doped compound  @xcite .",
    "overall , a substantial orbital differentiation , induced by hund s coupling , in the degree of correlation and localization of the conduction electrons associated with the different fe orbitals appears to play a role in the physics of iron - based superconductors . to what extent and",
    "how strongly in each family of materials is still an issue for future investigation .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that hund s coupling - induced correlations are relevant to other iron compounds  @xcite , such as e.g. fesi  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have emphasized that the hund s coupling plays an essential role in the physics of multi - orbital materials .",
    "it induces strong electronic correlations in itinerant materials which are not in close proximity to a mott insulating state .",
    "this is especially relevant to transition - metal oxides of the @xmath1 series and to iron pnictides and chalcogenides .",
    "a global picture has recently emerged , which has been reviewed in this article .",
    "some key questions remain unanswered however , to be addressed in future investigations .",
    "as reviewed above , the fermi liquid scale @xmath110 is strongly reduced by the hund s coupling , and a non fermi - liquid state with frozen local moments and power - law self - energy applies for @xmath111 . a precise theoretical understanding of this regime is still missing however .",
    "is this regime associated with a specific unstable fixed point of the underlying effective impurity model , within a single - site dmft approach ?",
    "this would yield the fascinating possibility that there is something universal to be learnt about the crossover between the very high - temperature regime of quasi isolated atoms and the very low - temperature fermi liquid .",
    "much work also remains to be done about the interplay of the effects described in this article with magnetic long - range order , a topic to which we have devoted only little discussion .",
    "how the development of inter - site magnetic correlations modifies the local picture reviewed here is to be addressed using other approaches , such as cluster extensions of dmft .",
    "although several indications of the key role played by the hund s coupling have been reviewed in this article , a direct ` smoking - gun ' evidence would be invaluable .",
    "finally , there are some important topics that we have not covered in this article .",
    "these include : the role of hund s coupling in stabilizing the ferromagnetic state  @xcite in transition metals and other materials ; the physics of negative ( antiferromagnetic ) hund s coupling , which can occur due to the jahn - teller coupling and is important for the physics of fullerides  @xcite ; the possibility of hund s coupling mediated pairing and superconductivity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; the role of the hund s coupling in heavy fermion compounds and in low - dimensional systems .",
    "last but not least , the interplay of the hund s coupling with the spin - orbit coupling is a topic of considerable current interest and of special relevance to the physics of transition - metal oxides of the @xmath176 series .",
