    "it is a common knowledge that the impact of a measuring device onto the object - under - test should be minimized if working with signal sources of essentially quantum nature .",
    "this is a general problem of non - disturbing quantum measurements . for electronic detecting facilities , especially amplifiers ,",
    "this means minimizing the energy , of noise or other origin , irradiated backwards to the object - under - test .",
    "the effect is a so called `` back action '' , the phenomenon causing uncontrolled destruction of a quantum state of the object , e.g. , the qubit decoherencing , etc . @xcite .",
    "the back action is detected and requires a quantitative description in a wide frequency band , orders of magnitude wider than the amplifier operation frequency band .",
    "therefore , the `` equivalent noise temperature '' ( @xmath0 ) determined for a relatively narrow operation frequency band of the amplifier ( receiver ) is an inadequate term here .",
    "instead , one should say about wide - spectrum brightness temperature of the amplifier and its active elements , at both the input and output `` terminals '' .",
    "the amplifiers intended for ultra - low temperature applications ( to amplify the signals from quantum detectors , single electron transistors and variety of other quantum structures ) are typically based on the field - effect transistors . among them",
    ", a class of hemt is distinguished , the field - effect transistors with high electron mobility .",
    "hemts feature a very wide operational frequency band while field - induced as opposed to thermally - generated current - carrier electrons ( two - dimensional electron gas , 2deg ) in the channel principally enable the transistor functionality down to the absolute zero temperature . owing these advantages of the hemts they are widely used in ultra - sensitive readout amplifiers@xcite for quantum devices signals .",
    "consequently , the quantitative description of the back action as applied to hemts is a hot issue .",
    "thermal noise is generated in the hemt input ( gate - source ) terminals due to power dissipation in the input circuit of the transistor .",
    "the dissipative losses come mainly from the gate metallization resistance , the under - gate channel resistance and the source resistance .",
    "the corresponding irradiation ( for perfect matching , or zero input reflection coefficient ) is characterized by the gate temperature @xmath1 which is close to the physical temperature of the transistor crystal lattice @xmath2 .",
    "cooling down to the cryogenic temperatures is an effective method to suppress the thermal irradiation .",
    "if an ultra - deep cooling is supposed , it should be accompanied by a considerable decrease ( down to a few microwatts and less ) in the transistor consumed / dissipated power to avoid excessive joule overheating of its active area .",
    "the situation with overheating becomes more severe because of low thermal conductivity of the heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the low cooling capacity of the ultra - low - temperature cryorefrigerators , especially below 100 mk , also strongly limits the hemt dissipated power .",
    "provided if the heat sink is effective , the input - circuit - generated thermal noise is reduced sufficiently and can be neglected regarding the back action .",
    "the `` hot '' electrons irradiation from the gate - drain channel region , being another cause of the back action , also contributes substantially to @xmath0 .",
    "a high effective electron temperature @xmath3 ( drain temperature ) exceeding the lattice temperature by two orders of magnitude is inherent for this mechanism .",
    "the irradiation of the 2deg in gate - drain part of the channel goes backward to the input via intrinsic drain - gate capacitance of the transistor .",
    "the excitation of the waveguide modes by the output circuit in the conductive cavity ( where the amplifier is placed and often the signal source ) is an additional way .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 can be roughly estimated using the reverse transmission gain ( @xmath4 ) from the transistor s - matrix .",
    "typically , @xmath4 is about -20 ... -30 db at 1 ghz frequency",
    ". the @xmath4 rises almost linearly with frequency so the effect of @xmath3 can prevail over @xmath5 . if the amplifier has a high input impedance ( @xmath4 is defined for 50-@xmath6 network ) , then the reverse transmission increases stimulating the search for the ways of @xmath3 reduction .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath5 are used to calculate basic noise characteristics of a transistor , namely , the minimal noise temperature , the optimal source impedance and the noise conductivity @xcite .",
    "the both @xmath3 and @xmath5 figures are extracted from a series of the noise measurements by solving the inverse problem @xcite on the basis of the electrophysical transistor model which is inevitably limited to certain frequency band and temperature range .",
    "integrally , the extraction procedure is sophisticated and ambiguous .    in the context of the back - action problem",
    ", the characteristics of the existing energy flows disturbing the quantum object should be found .",
    "the temperature is a natural quantifier of the chaotic ( noise ) irradiation .",
    "so , the task is rather to measure directly the brightness temperature than to solve the inverse problem on extraction of @xmath3 , @xmath5 or other similar noise invariants @xcite .",
    "first , to measure @xmath7 instrumentally , the contribution of the amplified noise of the input circuit to the integral output noise irradiation of the transistor should be excluded . referring to the modern transistors with cut - off frequencies of tens and more gigahertz ,",
    "such an elimination is hard enough because of stability problem .",
    "moreover , it becomes much more complicated under the deep - cooling conditions .",
    "however , the ultra - low power consumption of the transistor associated with deep - cooled amplifiers results in decrease in the cut - off frequency by two orders of magnitude while the stability factor exceeds the unity . consequently , the stability is not further an issue , and the direct instrumental measurement of @xmath7 become possible .    in this work",
    "we propose a simple method to measure directly the brightness temperature of the 2deg in a hemt channel .",
    "the results of the measurements are discussed and the recommendations on the choice of the hemt dc regime are formulated concerning the back action phenomenon .",
    "the simplified diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig.[fig01 ] .",
    "the essence of the technique are by - turn measurement and subsequent comparison of the powers of the two signals .",
    "the first one is produced by the output circuit of the transistor - under - test ( q1 ) , the second one is the reference , taken from a variable resistor r whose temperature is equal to the ambient temperature . during the calibration procedure ,",
    "the resistance r is set equal to the differential resistance of the channel in a specified point of the transistor static characteristics .",
    "the measurement cycle is described below in more detail .",
    "the transistor gate is ac - shorted to the source by c1 to exclude the amplified input circuit noise from the net output signal .",
    "the self inductance of the capacitor c1 ( smd 0603 , 330 pf ) along with the inductance of the q1 gate terminal does not exceed 3 nh .",
    "the associated reactance at a mean frequency ( 50 mhz ) of the operational range is inductive and not greater than 4@xmath8 and the capacitive reactance of the gate - source of more than 3@xmath9 k@xmath6 . under these conditions ,",
    "only the noise component representing the source resistance noise is amplified by the transistor adding to @xmath7 .",
    "this resistance does not exceed 3@xmath10 for practically all low - power hemts .",
    "taking into account that the transistor voltage gain does not exceed 5 under the microcurrent dc regime , it is easy to show that the contribution of the source noise in the output signal is less than 1% .    the transistor q1 and the variable resistor r",
    "are placed close to the instrumental amplifier to minimize the shunt capacitance . a three - stage hemt ( avago atf35143 ) high input impedance ( 100@xmath9 k@xmath6 ) , low - noise cooled amplifier ( hilna in fig.[fig01 ] )",
    "is used as the instrumental amplifier .",
    "the hilna gain is about 40 db , the operational frequency band is 20 to 100 mhz .",
    "the integral noise temperatures of the hilna are 2.3@xmath110.5 k and 1.2@xmath110.5 k at the source resistance of 10@xmath8 and 1000@xmath8 , respectively , and the ambient temperature @xmath12k .",
    "the amplifier circuitry is similar to the earlier reported devices @xcite .",
    "the measuring circuit is a low - q parallel tank consisted of the resistor r and hemt channel resistance , the capacitance of the wires , pads and hilna input ( totally 5 pf ) and the inductance l ( 3@xmath13h ) .",
    "a linear amplifier ( la ) with a band - pass filter ( 40 ... 80 mhz ) is placed next to the hilna . the specified frequency band ( namely , the lower edge )",
    "is chosen in order to exclude the @xmath14 noise of q1 .",
    "the output signal level is measured by a square - meter voltmeter ( smv ) within an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "the multisection filters are put into the supply circuits ( not shown in fig.[fig01 ] ) and the test unit is electromagnetically shielded .",
    "the measurement errors are 0.1% and 1.5% for the dc voltages and currents , correspondingly .",
    "the measuring cycle is a three - stage one .",
    "first , the resistor r is set to zero resistance , and the static characteristics of the transistor are measured .",
    "the drain - source resistance @xmath15 is calculated from the data obtained as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the smv readouts are taken for each calculated @xmath18 . according to the measurement procedure and nyquist theorem ,",
    "the smv voltage , which is proportional to the output signal power , can be written as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the mean square of the measured output voltage at a specified drain - source resistance @xmath18 , @xmath21 is the mean square of the measured output voltage at @xmath22 = 0 ( see below ) , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 is the brightness temperature of the noise irradiation of the transistor channel , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the total gain and effective pass band of the measuring system , correspondingly , at the specified @xmath18 .",
    "the second stage is a calibration .",
    "the transistor is zero - biased and maximally opened ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the channel resistance @xmath18 is minimal ( @xmath28=8@xmath111 @xmath6 for atf36077 ) and fully linear .",
    "the noise generated by @xmath18 is purely thermal ( white ) .",
    "it adds to the noise of the calibration resistor r with resistance @xmath22 .",
    "the calibration includes tuning the calibration resistor r in the range of 0 ... 670 @xmath6 while the smv readout is synchronously taken . in a manner similar to ( [ 1",
    "] ) , we write the equation for the smv output signal :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the mean square of the measured output voltage at a specified resistance @xmath22 of the calibration resistor r ( exactly , @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is the physical temperature of the calibration resistor r , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the total gain and the effective pass band of the measuring system , correspondingly , at the specified @xmath22 .",
    "finally , an expression for @xmath24 can be derived from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) taking @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "these equalities are valid if the experimental values are taken from the data array with the selection rule @xmath37 .",
    "then we obtain :    @xmath38    to simplify the measurement and calculation procedures , a few assumptions were made when writing ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath39=const is assumed , i.e. the noise temperature of the instrumental amplifier ( hilna ) does not depend on the source resistance .",
    "actually , it varies ( see above ) although always staying below the temperature to measure , @xmath24 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath39 is supposed to be measured at @xmath22=0 .",
    "in fact , the minimal value @xmath40 8 @xmath6 ( for atf36077 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) it is believed that the dc channel resistance @xmath18 is equal to the ac one , at the measurement frequency ( 40 - 60 mhz ) . in reality , the ac channel resistance is less by a few percent .",
    "all the assumptions made are not too rough , and the systematic absolute error ( see section iii ) does not exceed 2 k. nevertheless , it should be taken into account when @xmath24 is about several kelvins .",
    "when the measured @xmath24 is of some tens kelvins ( the most important and interesting range ) , the error is determined by the accuracy of the instrumental measurement being , by our estimate , of about 10% of the measured value . to the authors opinion ,",
    "this error is acceptable in the context of this work .",
    "additionally , the following should be clarified here .",
    "the drain temperature @xmath3 , as a parameter in the two - temperature pospeshalski noise model @xcite , actually represents the effective temperature of the 2deg in the saturated region ( roughly , the gate - drain region ) of the hemt channel .",
    "meanwhile , the expression ( [ 3 ] ) that we obtained for @xmath24 represents an averaged 2deg temperature throughout the whole channel including the source - gate part with its temperature which is always close to @xmath2 .",
    "it is the 2deg temperature that we designate by @xmath24 .",
    "it is measured directly and has a clear physical sense .",
    "however , @xmath3 and @xmath24 do not differ too much since the resistance of the source - gate region is about 1/100 of the total channel resistance .",
    "the measurement of @xmath24 can , in principle , be done without the calibration resistor , using the transistor noise instead at @xmath16 = 0 , @xmath41 = 0 . however , in practice this requires an extra ( negative ) bias voltage which could cause , for some transistors , the gate leakage noise to emerge .",
    "the pseudomorphic hemt avago atf36077 was chosen as a test object .",
    "we believe this transistor is a good representative of low - power hemts .",
    "additionally , as our practice show , atf36077 has a very low gate leakage current and a high mechanical stability during multiple thermal cycling .",
    "the atf36077 static characteristics show no hysteresis .",
    "all said above makes atf36077 a suitable object for testing the proposed measurement method .    the bias voltage and ,",
    "correspondingly , the maximal drain current were chosen so that the transistor dissipated power @xmath42 would not exceed @xmath43w .",
    "the larger @xmath42 values are beyond the subject of this work .",
    "also , at @xmath44w the transistor - under - test should be carefully monitored for a parasitic oscillation to emerge which is provoked by the gate grounding . the consumption current of the hilna is a suitable indicator of the parasitic oscillations .",
    "the measurements were taken at 4.2 k , 78 k and 290 k when developing the technique .",
    "the results of the measurements at 4.2 k are reported below .",
    "fig.[fig02 ] demonstrates the static characteristics and the electron temperature for atf36077 .",
    "let us start with these data to estimate the measurement error . to do this",
    ", we note that the measured @xmath24 is assumed to be equal to @xmath32 when @xmath16 = 0 , @xmath45 = 0 .",
    "it is quite reasonable from the physical point of view .",
    "then the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath32 in the origin of the static characteristic branch ( @xmath16=0 ) can serve as a measure of the absolute error .",
    "the data show that the systematic error does not exceed 2 k.    let us take conventionally @xmath46 db as a measure of the back action .",
    "also , we define the criterion of the acceptable irradiation in the direction of the signal source : the temperature of such an irradiation must not be higher than @xmath47 , that is @xmath48 .",
    "bearing in mind these definitions , a recommendation useful in designing the amplifiers with reduced back action can be derived from fig.[fig02 ] .",
    "namely , the maximal acceptable value of @xmath16 is 150 mv for hemt operating at @xmath49 k.    fig.[fig03 ] shows the electron temperature @xmath24 as a function of the drain current @xmath41 at fixed drain - source voltages @xmath16 .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath50 plot tends to a saturation and , there is no increase of the electron temperature with the current anyway .",
    "this witnesses for a negligible contribution of the channel diffusion noise induced onto the gate .",
    "therefore , the gate is `` well - grounded '' while the operation frequency and the circuit design are adequate .",
    "the @xmath24 as a function of @xmath16 at fixed drain currents is plotted in fig.[fig04 ] .",
    "it should be noted at once that the doubled electron temperature ( @xmath51 ) is observed at the voltages much higher than expected threshold values ( of order of 1 mv ) approximately following from the condition @xmath52 .",
    "the effect could evidence for the ballistic ( collision - free ) electron transport at corresponding parts of the static characteristics .",
    "a distinctive bend of the curve taken at the drain current of 100 @xmath53a may be associated with the threshold of the optical phonon scattering mechanism activation ( approximately 30 ev for the a3b5 semiconductors ) .",
    "the corresponding dc regime ( @xmath54ma , @xmath55mv ) can be recommended for the first - stage transistors in the amplifiers with minimized back action intended to function at subkelvin temperatures .",
    "the hemt ability of working at ultra - low supply voltages in the unsaturated region of the static characteristics was reported earlier in @xcite .",
    "the absence of the `` bend '' in the plots corresponding to the drain currents 20 and 50 @xmath53a is most likely due to the expansion of the under - gate depletion region towards the source .",
    "this effect probably causes the paradoxical rise of @xmath24 with decreasing the channel current ( fig.[fig04 ] ) as well .    the above estimates and the plots analysis is rather qualitative .",
    "they aimed , in the context of this work , to the demonstration of reasonability of the measurement of the electron temperature in studying electrophysical processes in hemts and finding the optimal regimes from the point of view of the back action problem .    to estimate the back action at low frequencies where @xmath14 noise predominates , it is necessary to measure the amplifier noise temperature with the standard procedure @xcite .",
    "a technique is suggested in this paper for the direct measurement of the brightness temperature of the 2deg in a hemt . the technical simplicity and clear physical sense of the measurement results makes the proposed method a convenient tool for further studies of the delicate electrophysical processes such as the ballistic electron transport and diffusion , the 2deg properties and so on .",
    "grounding on the results of the 2deg brightness temperature measurements , the recommendations are put for choosing the hemt dc regimes which are the best concerning the back action .",
    "it is found that the optimal hemt operation points to minimize the back action lie in the unsaturated area of the static characteristics that possibly corresponds to the electron ballistic transit .",
