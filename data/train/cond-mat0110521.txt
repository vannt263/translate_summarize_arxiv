    "markov chain monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are an indispensable tool for the study of physical models . to calculate expectation values in the gibbs canonical ensemble , most simulations use boltzmann weights . however , in the course of time it has become clear that the boltzmann factor is not always the most efficient weight to generate the desired configurations of the canonical ensemble . in particular before embarking on a large - scale computer simulation , one of the questions which ought to be addressed is `` what are suitable weight factors for the problem at hand ? '' nowadays simulations of more general ensembles are employed for an increasing number of applications in physics , chemistry , structural biology and other areas , for reviews see  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the multicanonical ( muca ) method  @xcite calculates in one simulation the canonical ensemble at many temperatures .",
    "its best - established application is calculations of interface tensions at first order phase transitions .",
    "there , canonically rare configurations are simply enhanced , the _ statical _ case .",
    "this is similar to the importance sampling idea , which for the calculation of canonical expectation values led from naive sampling to the markov process sampling with the boltzmann weights .",
    "the additional complication is now that the new weights are _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "the nowadays most important applications of the muca method are for complex systems  @xcite . there",
    ", the rational of muca simulations is to flatten free energy barriers , such that the _ dynamics _ of the simulation becomes improved .",
    "the enhancement of particular configurations can no longer be explicitly controlled and the issue of optimizing mc algorithms for complex systems is far from being well understood , although some improvements have been quite spectacular .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the muca method , using as illustration the @xmath0 ten - state potts model with its strong first - order phase transition .",
    "subsection  [ sec_recursion ] discusses the weight recursions of ref.@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "random walk and transition matrix methods  @xcite generalize the muca approach and are summarized in section  [ sec_rwtm ] .",
    "distinct from these methods are multiple markov chain algorithms  @xcite ( parallel tempering ) .",
    "they are introduced in section  [ sec_pt ] , where their recent combinations  @xcite with muca methods are also sketched . in section  [ sec_complex ]",
    "we turn to applications for complex systems . instead of being exhaustive ( see the reviews  @xcite ) we focus on two recent studies : a new analysis of the parisi overlap distribution for the 3d edwards - anderson ising spin glass  @xcite and the helix - coil transition of the polyalanine protein  @xcite . outlook and conclusions are given in section  [ sec_out ] .",
    "multicanonical simulations are best established for investigations of first - order phase transitions . for them",
    "pseudocritical points @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lattice size , exist such that the canonical energy density @xmath3 becomes double - peaked and the maxima at @xmath4 are of equal height @xmath5 . in between these values a minimum is located at some energy @xmath6 .",
    "configurations at @xmath6 are exponentially suppressed like @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interface tension and @xmath9 is the minimal area between the phases , @xmath10 for an @xmath11 lattice , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants . to determine the interface tension with binder s histogram method",
    ", one has to calculate the quantities @xmath14 and to make a finite size scaling ( fss ) extrapolation of @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "however , for large systems a canonical mc simulation will practically never visit configurations at energy @xmath17 and estimates of the ratio @xmath18 will be very inaccurate .",
    "the terminology _ supercritical slowing down _ was coined to characterize thus an exponential deterioration of simulation results with lattice size .",
    "the muca method overcomes this problem by sampling , in an appropriate energy range , with an _ approximation _",
    "@xmath19 to the inverse density of states @xmath20 . here",
    "the function @xmath21 is the inverse _ microcanonical temperature _ at energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the dimensionless , microcanonical free energy .",
    "one samples instead of the canonical energy distribution @xmath24 a new muca distribution @xmath25 the desired canonical distribution is obtained by re - weighting , which is rigorous , because the weights @xmath26 used in the actual simulation are exactly known . with the approximate relation ( [ pmuca ] )",
    "the average number of configurations sampled does no longer depend strongly on the energy and accurate estimates of the ratio ( [ itension ] ) @xmath27 become possible .",
    "the muca method requires two steps    1 .",
    "obtain a _ working estimate _ of the weights ( [ wmuca ] ) .",
    "working estimate means that the approximation to the inverse density of states has to be good enough to ensure movement in the desired energy range .",
    "2 .   perform a markov chain mc simulation with the weights @xmath28 .",
    "canonical expectation values are found by re - weighting to the gibbs ensemble and standard jackknife methods allow reliable error estimates .",
    "( 150,155 ) ( 0 , 0 )    for the @xmath0 10-state potts model figure  [ fig_bn92 ] reproduces a thus obtained muca histogram together with its canonically re - weighted energy histogram  @xcite .",
    "the canonical energy density of this figure gives the estimate @xmath29 of the interface tension on the @xmath30 lattice . combining",
    "the such obtained estimates from several lattices allows the infinite volume fss extrapolation @xmath31 . at the time of its publication",
    "this number was in strong disagreement with other numerical results .",
    "afterwards the exact value was discovered to be @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this success helped the acceptance of the method , which by now has been applied to a large number of models  @xcite .",
    "there exist many variants of the muca method .",
    "muca refers to calculations of canonical expectation values for a temperature range and re - weighting has to be done in the internal energy .",
    "similarly , other physical quantities can be considered , _",
    "e.g. _ _ multimagnetical _",
    "@xcite refers to simulations which give results for a certain range of the magnetic field .",
    "a variant for cluster updates due to janke and kappler  @xcite is called _ multibondic_. in ref.@xcite the _ multi - overlap _ algorithm was introduced , which focuses on the parisi order parameter of spin glasses ( see section  [ sec_complex ] ) . combining muca with multigrid methods",
    "has been explored by janke and sauer  @xcite . for molecular dynamics , langevin and hybrid mc variants",
    "see hansmann et al .",
    "@xcite and , with emphasise on lattice gauge theory , arnold et al .",
    "@xcite .      for spin systems with first - order phase transitions",
    "the fss behavior is relatively well known .",
    "provided the steps between system sizes are not too large , it is then possible to obtain working estimates of the @xmath26 weights by means of a fss extrapolation from the already simulated smaller systems @xcite .",
    "however , this method can not be applied to complex systems and to get a working estimate of the muca parameters by means of a recursion is then at the heart of the method .    as the overall normalization is irrelevant for updating purposes",
    ", it is sufficient to consider nearest neighbor ( in energy ) ratios of the weights  ( [ pmuca ] ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the smallest available energy step and @xmath35 refers to the @xmath36 iteration . initially , @xmath37 is a good starting value , because the system can then move freely .",
    "the final equation for the recursion , as derived in  @xcite , reads @xmath38^{\\hat{g}^n_0(e)}\\ ] ] where the exponent @xmath39 is recursively determined by the equations @xmath40",
    "@xmath41 @xmath42 typically , we want to cover an energy range @xmath43 the optimum for a flat energy distribution is given by a random walk in the energy .",
    "this implies a cpu time increase @xmath44 to keep the number of @xmath45 transitions constant .",
    "the recursion ( [ recursion ] ) needs an additional @xmath46 ( optimum ) number of attempts to cover the entire range .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising model on @xmath47 lattices , with @xmath48 ( the ground state ) and @xmath49 ( the average energy at @xmath50 ) , table  [ tab ] gives the number of sweeps per transition .",
    "the first transition is tedious to find , additional transitions are much faster .    .sweeps per @xmath51 transition for @xmath47 ising models . here",
    "@xmath52 refers to the first transition during the recursion  ( [ recursion ] ) , @xmath53 to the subsequent transitions during the recursion and @xmath54 to the transitions during the production part . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab ]    a new , possibly more efficient , recursion was recently proposed by f. wang and landau  @xcite ( my interpretation of the merits of the method differs somewhat from the authors ) .",
    "they perform updates with estimators @xmath55 of the density of states @xmath56\\ .\\ ] ] each time an energy level is visited , the estimator is updated according to @xmath57 where , initially , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "once the desired energy range is covered , the factor @xmath60 is refined , @xmath61 until some small value like @xmath62 is reached . a fast convergence towards a good estimator of the spectral density",
    "is reported .",
    "afterwards the usual , muca production runs may be carried out .",
    "a comparison of the recursions  ( [ recursion ] ) and  ( [ wl_recursion1],[wl_recursion2 ] ) is subtle , because in neither case is the optimal schedule or termination point known .",
    "the basic idea of the approach  @xcite is to employ general transition matrix elements instead of just weight factors .",
    "an example is wang s  @xcite random walk algorithm , which uses the transition probabilities  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the microcanonical average for the number of transitions from the configuration @xmath65 with energy @xmath22 to the configuration @xmath66 with energy @xmath67 .",
    "a flat histogram is obtained and the configuration dependence is reduced to energy dependence .",
    "the density of states is obtained from the equation  @xcite @xmath68 @xmath69 the history and general merits of the approach are reviewed in  @xcite . there , it is claimed that , in some situations , equation  ( [ sp_eqn ] ) works more efficiently than the wang - landau recursion  ( [ wl_recursion1],[wl_recursion2 ] ) .",
    "however , the issue may not be settled .",
    "in particular , it seems  @xcite that in the random walk mc the use of estimators for @xmath64 faces more serious problems than the use of estimators for the weights in muca simulations . after defining reasonable schedules and termination points , one could compare the transition times of table  [ tab ] with those achieved with wang s random walk approach .",
    "the developments sketched above have to be distinguished from the method of multiple markov chains ( _ parallel tempering _ ) , which was introduced by geyer  @xcite and , independently , by hukusima and nemoto  @xcite .",
    "the latter work was influenced by the _ simulated tempering _",
    "@xcite method , which in turn can be understood as a special case of the _ method of expanded ensembles _  @xcite .",
    "parallel tempering is particularly well suited for parallel processing on clusters of workstations .",
    "parallel tempering performs @xmath35 canonical mc simulations at different @xmath70-values with boltzmann weight factors @xmath71 with @xmath72 and allows exchange of neighboring @xmath70-values @xmath73 these transitions lead to the energy change @xmath74 which is accepted or rejected according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the @xmath75-values have to be determined such that a reasonably large acceptance rate is obtained for the @xmath70 exchange ( [ del_beta_pt ] ) and ref.@xcite employs a recursive method .    _",
    "remark : _ the method works for dynamical but not for statical supercritical slowing down , because each member of the discrete set of weight factors samples still a boltzmann distribution ( _ e.g. _ it is not a valid method for calculating interfacial tensions ) .",
    "this can possibly be overcome by applying the parallel tempering idea to gaussian distributions instead of the canonical ensemble ( communicated to the author by t. neuhaus ) .",
    "ref.@xcite explores earlier introduced  @xcite combinations of parallel tempering , called replica - exchange method in  @xcite , with muca methods .",
    "the replica - exchange muca algorithm performs a short replica - exchange simulation to determine the muca weight factors and continues with the production part of a regular muca simulation , whereas muca replica - exchange works with replicas of the muca ensemble in different energy ranges .",
    "the relevance of muca methods for complex systems was pointed out early  @xcite . in these systems",
    "one encounters large free energy barriers due to disorder and frustration .",
    "multicanonical simulations try to overcome the barriers through excursions into the disordered phase .",
    "in addition , one may try to identify and enhance relevant rare configurations . here , we limit our interest to two recent studies of ( a )  spin glasses and ( b )  proteins . for reviews of applications to complex systems",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the parisi overlap parameter @xmath76 is defined as the overlap of two replicas of the system at identical temperatures @xmath77 the free - energy structure of the spin glass system is thought to be intimately related to the barriers in the parisi order parameter distributions .",
    "the _ multi - overlap _ variant  @xcite of the muca method enhances the minima of the parisi overlap parameter densities . using the method in large - scale simulations led to a variety of new insights , for instance about the self - averaging properties of free energy barriers  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is most dramatic for the tails of the averaged parisi order parameter distribution .",
    "recently , this allowed us to demonstrate a conjectured relation between the overlap probability density and extreme order statistics over about 80 orders of magnitude  @xcite , see figure  [ fig_spggumble ] .",
    "( 150,155 ) ( 0 , 0 )      proteins are linear polymers with the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as monomers .",
    "chains smaller than a few tens of amino acids are called peptides .",
    "the problem is to predict the folded conformation of proteins and peptides solely from their amino acid sequence . for many years",
    "the emphasis of numerical investigations has been on finding the global minimum potential energy and the major difficulty encountered is the multiple minima problem .",
    "molecular dynamics has been the numerical method of first choice , but the fraction of stochastic investigations shows an increasing trend .",
    "the major advantage of muca and related methods in the context of proteins is that they allow for investigations of the _ thermodynamics _ of the entire free energy landscape of the protein .",
    "this was realized by hansmann and okamoto  @xcite when they introduced muca sampling to the problem of protein folding and , slightly later , by hao and scheraga  @xcite . since then",
    "numerous applications have been performed and the simulations have been quite successful for peptides . by now a quite extensive literature exists , which is compiled in  @xcite . in ref.@xcite the weight recursion  ( [ recursion ] ) is adapted to these systems with continuous energy .    a particularly nice application is the helix formation of polyalanine by means of a muca simulation  @xcite , depicted in figure  [ fig_helix ] . up to @xmath78 amino acids",
    "are studied numerically and a phase transition develops at @xmath79 in the infinite volume limit ( pseudocritical temperature for finite systems are in the range from @xmath80 to @xmath81 ) .",
    "fss estimates of the critical indices @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are consistent with a first - order transition .",
    "progress is made concerning the inclusion of aqueous solutions into the simulation  @xcite .",
    "sampling of broad energy distributions allows supercritical slowing down to be overcome .",
    "this is well established for first - order phase transitions .",
    "systems with conflicting constraints remain , despite some progress , notoriously difficult and for them most hope lies in achieving further algorithmic improvements .",
    "reasonably large peptides , at the border to proteins , are promising systems for a complete coverage .",
