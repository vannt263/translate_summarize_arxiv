    "the upscattering features are more prominent in fig .",

    "[ m0.5]b because the shock temperature , and hence @xmath26 , is higher .",
    "the sharpness of the upscattering features seen in the 6.4kev profiles in particular can be attributed to the maximum possible energy gain when @xmath100 and to very few hot electrons with energies beyond a few standard deviations of the mean thermal ( maxwellian ) energy .",
    "scattering features are less prominent in the low @xmath10 cases ( figs .",
    "[ m1]a and [ m0.5]a ) , since the overall optical depth is smaller . for @xmath66 and @xmath49 for instance , the optical depth across the column at the shock",

    "these photons propagate through a thick section of cold pre - shock flow and can thus downscatter , resulting in broadening redward of the line centre .",
    "however , the electron number density , and hence , optical depth , in the pre - shock flow is small so recoil effects are correspondingly small .",

    "the emission height of the 6.97kev line is significantly higher than in the @xmath64 case and consequently , thermal doppler broadening is more prominent .",
    "the additional cooling in the accretion column also results in a lower plasma temperature at the base of the column , @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ profiles ] ) , near where irradiation of neutral iron occurs and the fluorescent 6.4kev line is emitted .",

    "upscattering and recoil features that are only marginally seen in the @xmath112 case are considerably more pronounced in the @xmath113 case .",

    "there is a remarkable similarity between the observed and the simulated spectra for the 6.4  kev line in particular .",
    "realistically , the actual strengths of the 6.675 and 6.97kev lines depend on the ionisation structure of the flow @xcite , since this determines the emissivity of the lines .",
    "the h - like and he - like lines are thus potentially powerful diagnostic tools that can be used to deduce the physical properties of the post - shock accretion column in mcvs .",
    "the 6.4kev line strength , on the other hand , depends on the flux of the illuminating x - rays , which is largest near the wd surface .",
    "fluorescent lines may also be produced in the surface atmospheric region around the accretion column @xcite , and this may contribute to the observed equivalent width of the 6.4kev line .    the observed fluorescent line in gk  per exhibits a red wing extending to 6.33  kev which @xcite attribute to doppler shifts . in general",
    "we find that bulk doppler shifts have a negligible effect on fe k@xmath0 lines .",
    "our simulated spectra show a weaker red wing arising from downscatterings near the base of the accretion column .",
    "the observed spectrum also exhibits a shoulder extending 170  ev redward of the 6.4kev line centre , which @xcite suggest may be due to compton downscattering .",
    "our simulations confirm that recoil can indeed affect the fluorescent line when it is emitted at the base of the accretion column , although in our spectra ( fig .  [ gkper ] ) there is no clear evidence that recoil extends down to 170  ev redward of the 6.4  kev line .",
    "we have investigated line distortion and broadening effects due to compton scattering in the accretion column of mcvs using a nonlinear monte carlo technique that takes into account the nonuniform temperature , velocity and density profiles of the post - shock column . scattered fe k@xmath0 lines were simulated for a range of different physical parameters : white dwarf mass , accretion rate , magnetic field strength and inclination angle .",
    "the photon source regions in the post - shock flow were determined from the ionization structure and the effects due to the bulk velocity doppler shift and thermal broadening are also considered .",
    "we find that line profiles are most affected by compton scattering in the cases of low white dwarf mass , high specific mass accretion rate , strong cyclotron cooling and oblique inclination angles .",
    "both a lower white dwarf mass ( or equivalently a larger white dwarf radius ) and a higher accretion rate result in a higher optical depth , hence more pronounced scattering effects .",
    "strong cyclotron cooling associated with a high magnetic field strength results in a higher density in the post - shock flow and hence , a correspondingly larger optical depth . recoil signatures are evident for oblique viewing angles when cyclotron cooling becomes important .",
    "these are due to scatterings near the base of the flow , where both the dynamical and thermal velocities are small .",
    "sharp upscattering features are also seen in the line profiles for large viewing angles .",
    "these upscattering features are attributed to head - on collisions with hot electrons near the shock .",
    "photons emitted close to the shock in the accretion column display more thermal doppler broadening .",
    "this is generally the case for the fe   6.97kev line .",
    "the fe 6.4kev and fe   6.675kev lines are generally emitted at or near the base of the accretion column respectively , and show a relatively small amount of thermal doppler broadening .",
    "bulk velocity induced doppler shifts are negligible compared with scattering",
    ".    we also investigated the effects of dispersing the 6.675 and 6.97  kev line photons using an emissivity calculated self - consistently from the ionization structure of the post - shock column .",
    "we find that , compared to injecting the line photons at a single height where the emissivity peaks , using an emissivity profile does not significantly change the overall profiles of the 6.675 and 6.97  kev lines .",
    "the resulting line profiles show a small degree of smearing redward of the line center due to additional dynamical and thermal doppler effects associated with a small fraction of line photons emitted close to the shock .",
    "the effect is most important for the 6.675  kev line .",
    "we estimate a fractional increase in the fwhm of no more than @xmath127  25% .",
    "in general , our simulations predict that recoil in scattering with cool electrons near the base of the column as well as upscattering by hot electrons near the shock can imprint signatures on the profile of lines emitted near the base of the flow .",
    "such compton signatures may thus be used to determine the primary source region of the fluorescent line .",
    "we predict that when 6.4kev photons are emitted in the dense , cool plasma at the base of the accretion column , they can suffer strong downscattering when propagating through the electrons streaming downward in the flow .",
    "the scattering probability is governed by the effective scattering optical depth , which increases with the mass accretion rate of the system .",
    "we convolved simulations with the _ chandra _ response function and compared them to _",
    "chandra_/hetgs observations of gk per .",
    "our results indicate that the red wing seen in the 6.4kev line in gk per could be attributed to compton recoil near the base of the flow .",
    "finally we remark that tighter constraints on the dynamics and flow geometry in magnetized accreting compact objects can be obtained by considering the polarization properties of the lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is currently considerable effort to develop x - ray polarimeters which can detect degrees of polarization of the order of one percent @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution of these detectors should be adequate to search for different polarization degrees in emission iron lines .",
    "it is possible to include a polarization treatment in our calculations , but the computational algorithm in our monte carlo code will need to be revised , which we leave for a future study .",
