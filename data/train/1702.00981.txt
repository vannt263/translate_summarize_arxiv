    "positronium ( ps ) is a light atom that consists of an electron and its antiparticle , the positron .",
    "positron- and positronium - annihilation - lifetime spectroscopy is a widely used tool for studying materials , e.g. , for determining pore sizes and free volume . for smaller pores the radius of the ps atom itself",
    "can not be neglected .",
    "this quantity was probed in a recent experiment which measured the cavity shift of the ps @xmath3-@xmath5 line  @xcite , and the data calls for proper theoretical understanding  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the eigenstates of ps in a hard - wall spherical cavity and determine the effective collisional radius of ps in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 states as a function of its center - of - mass momentum .",
    "the most common model for pore - size estimation is the tao - eldrup model  @xcite .",

    "the ps is modeled as a point particle with mass @xmath11 in a spherical potential well , where @xmath12 is the mass of an electron / positron .",
    "collisions of @xmath9-ps with the cavity walls allow for positron two - gamma ( @xmath13 ) annihilation with the electrons in the wall , which reduces the @xmath9-ps lifetime with respect to the vacuum @xmath14-annihilation value of 142  ns . to simplify the description of the penetration of the ps wave function into the cavity wall",
    ", the radius of the potential well is taken to be @xmath15 , where the best value of @xmath16 has been empirically determined to be 0.165  nm  @xcite .",
    "the model and its extensions are still widely used for pore sizes in 1100  nm range  @xcite .",
    "porous materials and ps confinement in cavities also enabled a number of fundamental studies , such as measurement of ps - ps interactions  @xcite , detection of the ps@xmath17 molecule @xcite and its optical spectroscopy  @xcite , and measurements of the cavity - induced shift of the ps lyman-@xmath18 ( @xmath3-@xmath5 ) transition  @xcite . cavities also hold prospects of creating a bose - einstein condensate of ps atoms and an annihilation - gamma - ray laser  @xcite .",
    "seen in a wider context , the old subject of confined atoms  @xcite has seen renewed interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "studies in this area not only serve as interesting thought experiments but also apply to real physical situations , e.g. , atoms under high pressure  @xcite or atoms trapped in fullerenes  @xcite . for @xmath9-ps there is a specific question about the extent to which confinement in a cavity affects its intrinsic @xmath14 annihilation rate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    for smaller cavities the effect of a finite radius of the trapped particle on its center - of - mass motion can not be ignored .",
    "in fact , the radius of a composite quantum particle depends on the way this quantity is defined and probed .",
    "for example , the proton is usually characterized by its root - mean - squared charge radius .",
    "it is measured in elastic electron - proton scattering  @xcite or using spectroscopy of exotic atoms , such as muonic hydrogen  @xcite ( with as yet unexplained discrepancies between these experiments ) . for a particle trapped in a cavity ,",
    "any practically defined radius may depend on the nature of its interaction with the walls .    in the present work we consider the simple problem of a ps atom confined in a hard - wall spherical cavity .",
    "the finite size of ps gives rise to energy shifts with respect to the energy levels of a pointlike particle in the cavity .",
    "this allows us to calculate the effective _ collisional _ radius of ps that describes its interaction with the impenetrable cavity wall .",
    "ps is a hydrogenlike atom with a total mass of 2 and reduced mass of @xmath19 ( in atomic units ) .",
    "the most probable distance between the electron and positron in a free ground - state ps atom is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bohr radius , while the mean electron - positron separation is @xmath22  @xcite . for excited states",
    "ps@xmath23 ) these quantities increase as @xmath24 .",
    "the ps center of mass is halfway between the two particles , so the most probable radius of ps(@xmath3 ) is @xmath25 , its mean radius being @xmath26 .",
    "one can expect that the distance of closest approach between the ps center of mass and the wall with which it collides will be similar to these values .",
    "one can also expect that this distance will depend on the center - of - mass momentum of the ps atom , as it will be `` squashed '' when colliding with the wall at higher velocities .",
    "a proper quantum - mechanical treatment of this problem is the subject of this work .",
    "a configuration - interaction ( ci ) approach with a @xmath0-spline basis is used to construct the states of ps inside the cavity . using these we determine the dependence of the effective ps radius on the center - of - mass momentum for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 states .",
    "of course , the interaction between ps and cavity walls in real materials is different from the idealized situation considered here .",
    "it can be modeled by changing the electron - wall and positron - wall potentials . on the other hand",
    ", the hard - wall cavity can be used as a theoretical tool for studying ps interactions with atoms  @xcite . an atom placed at the center of the cavity",
