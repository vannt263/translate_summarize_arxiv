    "this follows from a result in @xcite , which calculates perverse ( @xmath57 ) signatures for a pseudomanifold with a single smooth singular stratum as the sum of the signature on its complement ( i.e. , the signature of @xmath25 ) and a set of terms arising from the second and higher pages in the leray spectral sequence of the link bundle of the singular stratum .",

    "first , theorem 1.2 from @xcite may be rephrased as :    @xcite[ihthm ] let @xmath924 be the interior of a manifold with boundary @xmath98 and boundary defining function @xmath136 .",

    "endow @xmath25 with a geometrically flat fibred cusp - metric for the fibration @xmath162 .",

    "[ fbmetrics ] under the conditions of theorem [ ihthm ] , if @xmath932 is the fibred boundary metric conformal to @xmath74 , then @xmath933 where @xmath934 .",
    "if we take @xmath163 to be the conformally related fibred boundary metric on @xmath25 , then the conformal relationship @xmath932 means that @xmath935 this means for the hodge star operators that also @xmath936 , so in fact the extended harmonic forms in these spaces are the same .",
    "if the boundary fibration @xmath162 is a product , @xmath937 , then we can also define the dual fibration , @xmath938 .",
    "if @xmath25 is the interior of @xmath98 where the fibration structure on @xmath929 is given by @xmath162 , then let @xmath939 denote the same manifold , but where we now take the fibration structure on @xmath929 to be given by @xmath696 .",
    "then a fibred boundary metric on @xmath25 ( i.e. , with respect to the fibration @xmath162 ) is a fibred scattering metric on @xmath939 ( i.e. , with respect to @xmath696 ) , and @xmath940 .",
    "thus we can also write    [ cfhodge ] under the conditions of theorem [ ihthm ] , if @xmath941 is the fibred scattering metric on @xmath939 , that is , @xmath25 where the boundary fibration is @xmath938 , then @xmath942 where @xmath934 .",
    "theorem [ hodge ] follows from this last corollary and theorem [ ihhi ] by taking @xmath943 and @xmath944 : @xmath945      we consider the same space @xmath548 as in example [ example1 ] , stratified as before .",
    ". we can endow this with a geometrically flat fibred scattering metric : @xmath947 note that if we make the change of coordinates @xmath948 near @xmath949 , we get a metric that is a perturbation of one of the form in definition [ cfmetric ] that decays like @xmath950 .",
    "this turns out to be sufficient to use the same analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we consider extended @xmath0 harmonic forms on @xmath951 with no weight ( @xmath918 ) , then theorem [ hodge ] says @xmath952 where @xmath953 .",
    "that is , the spaces of extended unweighted @xmath0 harmonic forms on @xmath25 should be isomorphic to the spaces with @xmath240 as we calculated in section [ example1 ] .    in order to identify the extended @xmath0 harmonic forms on @xmath954 it is useful to observe a few things .",
    "first , since the metric is a global product metric , the extended @xmath0 harmonic forms on @xmath25 are all products of extended @xmath0 harmonic forms on @xmath955 with harmonic forms on @xmath217 .",
    "thus it suffices to determine the extended harmonic forms on @xmath60 with the metric @xmath956 .",
    "second , we observe that @xmath957 is a scattering metric , and is thus conformally invariant ( with conformal factor @xmath958 ) to a b - metric . by the same argument as in corollary [ fbmetrics ] , this means that extended harmonic forms on @xmath959 are the same as extended weighted @xmath0 harmonic forms on @xmath960 .",
    "these forms are , in turn , known to be in the kernel of @xmath43 and @xmath42 independently ( see either proposition 6.16 in @xcite or lemma 4.3 in @xcite ) . thus we know that extended harmonic @xmath0 forms on @xmath60 are both closed and co - closed .",
    "this means that the only possible 0-forms are constants and the only possible 2-forms are constant multiples of the volume form .",
    "third , recall that for a differential form to be extended harmonic , it must be in @xmath961 for all @xmath962 , or equivalently , @xmath963 .",
    "if we consider constant functions , this means we need @xmath964 this is not true , so @xmath965 . by an analogous argument ( or equivalently , by poincar duality ) , also @xmath966 .    finally consider @xmath967 .",
    "the space of extended @xmath0 harmonic forms of middle degree is preserved by a conformal change of metric , and as noted before , @xmath957 is conformally equivalent to the metric @xmath968 if we reparametrise , setting @xmath969 , this becomes the metric on the infinite cylinder : @xmath970 if we use a fourier series decomposition in @xmath971 , we find that a 1-form @xmath972 @xmath973 is closed and coclosed if @xmath974 and @xmath975 are constant and the remaining coefficients satisfy @xmath976 , that is , they are all exponential functions in @xmath977 , and thus blow up at either @xmath978 or @xmath979 , so are not almost in @xmath0 .",
    "so the only extended @xmath0 harmonic forms are @xmath980 , which are in @xmath981 as required .",
    "thus @xmath982 .",
    "now when we take the tensor product with @xmath983 , we get @xmath984 as predicted by theorem [ hodge ] .",
    "it is useful if we can understand the map from extended harmonic forms to @xmath56 cohomology as given by sending an extended harmonic form to the @xmath56 class that it represents : @xmath985 $ ] , as in the classical hodge theorem . however , the extended harmonic forms in our hodge theorem do not lie in either of the two complexes we have seen that calculate @xmath52 . to see them as representatives of classes , we need new spaces of forms that can be used to calculate the @xmath56 cohomology spaces and that do contain the extended harmonic forms",
