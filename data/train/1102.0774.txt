    "radio galaxies exhibit several extended components on the kpc scale , namely : jets , hotspots and lobes .",
    "the lobes are double structures extended over large scales , roughly symmetrical and ellipsoidal lying on both sides of the active nuclei of radio galaxies .",
    "it was first noticed by fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) that the relative positions of regions of high and low surface brightness in the extended components of extragalactic radio sources are correlated with their radio luminosity .",
    "it was found that nearly all sources with luminosity @xmath5 @xmath6 2 @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath9 w hz@xmath10 str@xmath10 were of class i ( i.e. , fri ) while the brighter sources were nearly all of class ii ( i.e. , frii ) .",
    "fris have a surface brightness which is larger toward their cores while friis have it larger toward their edges .",
    "the morphology of radio galaxies turns out to reflect the method of energy transport in the radio source .",
    "fri radio galaxies typically have bright jets in the center , while friis have faint jets but bright hotspots at the ends of their lobes ( e.g. , baum et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the radio emission arising from the lobes is widely interpret as due to synchrotron radiation , while the high - energy radiation has been successfully described as inverse compton emission off the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ) .",
    "moreover , because of the low electron densities in the large lobe volumes the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) mechanism produces a negligible contribution both at x - ray and at @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 , croston et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter c05 ) .",
    "the radio lobes extension is typically @xmath3 100 kpc implying a timescale for their growth spanning from tens to hundreds of millions of years ( blundell & rawlings 2000 , mullin et al .",
    "if relativistic particles in the lobes are not continuously accelerated , considering the synchrotron cooling time @xmath11 @xmath3 16.4 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14(g ) yr , relativistic electrons with lorentz factor @xmath0 @xmath15 10@xmath2 in magnetic fields of @xmath3 10@xmath16 - 10@xmath17 g do not emit on epochs longer than @xmath3 1 myr , which is shorter than the age of radio lobes ( van der laan & perola 1969 ) .",
    "a population of energetic electrons is required to interpret the radio / millimeter observations of radio galaxy lobes ( e.g. , hardcastle & looney 2008 ) , and recently , the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) and _ fermi _  observations of the centaurus a lobes ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2009 : abdo et al .",
    "in addition , the _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _   and _ suzaku _  observations of radio galaxy lobes ( isobe et al . 2002 , 2005 , 2009 ,",
    "kataoka et al .",
    "2003 , c05 ) show that their ic / cmb spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is rising in the x - rays and consequently a significant fraction of their high - energy emission is expected to be radiated in the hard x - rays and at low energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "following the idea of bergamini et al .",
    "( 1967 ) , the ic / cmb process of extended structures in radio galaxies could provide a significant contribution to the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0 ray background ( egb ) in the kev to mev energy range .",
    "the contribution to the egb of kpc - scale jets in the case of fris , from ic scattering of starlight photons by the ultrarelativistic electrons , has been estimated by stawarz et al .",
    "these estimates show that this emission contributes @xmath3 1% of the egb at gev energies , and it is less relevant at mev energies , where the contribution of the ic / cmb emission peaks .    in this letter",
    ", we adopt a statistical acceleration scenario for the lobes in friis , due to turbulent magnetic fields , that balances the radiative cooling and keeps electron energies up to @xmath0 @xmath3 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 ( e.g. , pacholczyk & scott 1976 , eilek & shore 1989 ) , in agreement with the recent _ fermi _  observations . a similar mechanism has been proposed by hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and osullivan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to identify radio galaxy lobes as possible accelerators for the ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( e.g. , hillas 1984 ) .",
    "finally , we consider a template sed of the emission from the friis lobes to estimate their contribution to the egb .",
    "we use cgs units and a flat cosmology with @xmath18 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( dunkley et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons in radio galaxy lobes are subject to two main radiative loss processes : the synchrotron radiation and the ic / cmb .",
    "the first mechanism is responsible for the lobe radio emission , while the latter describes their observed high - energy emission in the x - rays , and recently , also in the @xmath0-rays as in the nearby case of centaurus a ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) .    to clarify these radiative processes",
    "it is interesting to consider the case of a single relativistic electron of lorentz factor @xmath0 .",
    "the total power emitted via synchrotron and ic / cmb radiation is : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lobe magnetic field while @xmath23 = 3.26 @xmath12 10@xmath17@xmath24 g , the value of the magnetic field that has the same energy density as the cmb at redshift @xmath25 ( e.g. , murgia et al .",
    "the @xmath26 ratio identifies which emission process , synchrotron or ic / cmb , is more relevant for the electron radiative cooling .",
    "ratio ( upper panel ) for the friis lobes in the sample of c05 .",
    "the dashed red line indicates the case @xmath26 = 1 , when synchrotron and ic / cmb losses have the same relevance .",
    "b ) the equivalent spherical radius of the lobe volume , @xmath27 , as a function of redshift estimated for the same sample.,width=332,height=283 ]    in figure 1(a ) , we report the @xmath26 ratio and @xmath27 , the equivalent spherical radius of the lobe volume , with respect to @xmath25 , for the sample of frii lobes detected in the x - rays ( c05 ) , where @xmath22 has been estimated by fitting the radio - to - x - ray lobe seds .",
    "we note that the ratio @xmath26 is of order a few , in particular for the sources with larger @xmath27 at low redshift ( i.e. @xmath280.5 ) , for which the cmb energy density exceeds the estimate of the magnetic field energy density ( figure 1(b ) ) .",
    "seventy - five percent of the considered frii lobes have @xmath26 in the range 0.72 ( figure 1a ) , suggesting that in these sources the radiative losses for synchrotron and for ic / cmb have similar importance .",
    "this strongly suggests that the luminosity ratio of the two sed components @xmath29 is @xmath3 1",
    ".    however , these estimates of the @xmath26 ratio for radio galaxy lobes are dependent on the choice of the particle energy distribution ( ped ) adopted .",
    "the restricted energy ranges , where lobe emission is detected , do not allow us to estimate the ped shape and to constrain the @xmath29 accurately , introducing uncertainties in the estimates of the @xmath26 .",
    "another relevant process for particle energy losses in lobes is adiabatic expansion .",
    "these losses could play a significant role during the evolution of radio lobes ( e.g. , longair et al .",
    "assuming a self similar expansion scenario ( e.g. , matthews & scheuer 1990 , kaiser & alexander 1997 ) , the adiabatic losses are relevant in the initial phase of the lobe evolution , as in the case of young , compact radio galaxies .    during the final phase of the lobe expansion , when the lobe pressure is in equilibrium with that of the external medium , losses are dominated by radiative processes , e.g. , via ic / cmb or synchrotron emission ( if @xmath26 is still @xmath30 1 ) .",
    "friis , with lobe size @xmath15 30 - 50 kpc , can be considered at the end of their evolution , when the adiabatic expansion losses are negligible ( e.g. , pacholczyk & scott 1976 ) .",
    "acceleration by turbulent magnetic fields ( due to electron scattering with magnetized plasma irregularities ) via second order _ fermi _",
    "mechanisms , could be considered as a possible mechanism to compensate both the synchrotron and the ic radiative losses ( e.g. , eilek & shore 1989 , osullivan et al . 2009 , hardcastle 2010 ) .    adopting this scenario , the acceleration timescale via statistical mechanism",
    "can be written as @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the characteristic length scale of the magnetic field inhomogeneities ( i.e. , the mean free path of the electrons between collisions ) and @xmath35 = @xmath36 is the ratio of the alfvn velocity @xmath37 and the speed of light @xmath38 . consequently , according to kardashev ( 1962 ) , the energy gain by systematic statistical acceleration , for a single relativistic electron in a turbulent magnetic field @xmath22 is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy density of the turbulent magnetic field , @xmath41 is the plasma density and @xmath42 and @xmath43 the electron and the proton mass , respectively ( e.g. , tsytovich 1966 , eilek & shore 1989 ) .",
    "we can estimate the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons in the lobes , balancing the acceleration energy gain ( equation ( 2 ) ) with the radiative losses ( equation ( 1 ) ) : @xmath44 that is only dependent on the length scale , @xmath34 , on the plasma density , @xmath45 , and on the @xmath26 ratio .",
    "lobes are usually assumed to be close to the equipartition condition between magnetic field and electrons , implying @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath3 10@xmath16 g ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , the recent case of pictor a ( migliori et al . 2007 ) or similar friis ( e.g. , brunetti et al . 2002 ,",
    "isobe et al .",
    "2005 , c05 ) suggest that this requirement is not very tight indicating that for a lobe with @xmath25 between 0.5 and 1 , as the majority of frii lobes are detected in x - rays , @xmath26 is of the order of unity ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "the mean free path , until an electron collides with a magnetic inhomogeneity in a turbulent plasma , must be smaller than the source size and it has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath3 1 kpc ( e.g. , lacombe 1977 ) .",
    "consequently , substituting @xmath34 @xmath3 10@xmath48@xmath27 @xmath32 10@xmath49 cm into equation ( 3 ) , and assuming @xmath26 @xmath3 1 , @xmath50 is of the order of 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 , as required to interpret the @xmath0-ray emission of centaurus a lobes as ic / cmb and in agreement with the estimate of osullivan et al .",
    "this is consistent the radio / millimeter observations of radio galaxies ( e.g. , hardcastle & looney 2008 ) , that imply the presence of a population of high - energy electrons in their lobes ( i.e. , @xmath51 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 ) .",
    "our scenario is also in agreement with that proposed by pacholczyk & scott ( 1976 ) for the in situ re - acceleration of extended structures in radio galaxies .",
    "we note that electrons with energies @xmath0 @xmath3 10@xmath52 - 10@xmath53 have synchrotron cooling times @xmath11 @xmath3 10@xmath54 - 10@xmath55 yr and are not expected to be present in radio lobes at the epochs of about few myrs ( which is the typical lobe age ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the non - detection of lobes at ir and optical frequencies ( i.e. , @xmath56 @xmath3 10@xmath57hz ) , where the synchrotron emission in a magnetic field of about @xmath58 - @xmath59 g of electrons with @xmath0 @xmath3 10@xmath52 - 10@xmath53 should be seen .    [",
    "sec : egb].,width=328,height=283 ]",
    "the cmb is a blackbody exhibiting the peak frequency of the sed at @xmath60 @xmath3 1.6 @xmath12 10@xmath61 hz ( adopting the wien law ) .",
    "consequently , the expected peak frequency of the ic emission in thomson regime is @xmath62 .",
    "low energy electrons at @xmath63 radiate via ic / cmb in the x - ray band , while electrons with @xmath1 - 10@xmath2 emit in the mev - gev energy range .",
    "the emission arising from highest energy electrons produces the tail of the ic / cmb sed component and as such its intensity is not expected to be extremely large making the source undetectable by _ fermi _ , unless the radio galaxy lies at very low redshift .",
    "as previously anticipated this high - energy radiation could contribute to the diffuse egb . to take this contribution into account",
    ", we built a template sed of the lobe emission from the radio to @xmath0-rays .",
    "the template has been evaluated assuming a smooth log - normal ped : @xmath64 , ( massaro et al .",
    "this distribution has been suggested as intrinsic shape of lobe and hotspots ( e.g. , katz - stone & rudnick 1994 ) . the parameters considered to calculate our sed template are reported in table 1 and it is shown in figure 2a .",

    "+     +    we did not assume that the ic / cmb emission is beamed , since there is no evidence of relativistic bulk motion in lobes .",
    "we chose the value of @xmath27 to be consistent with the typical value of the c05 sample ( see figure 1(b ) ) , and @xmath65 to have the peak of the synchrotron emission in the radio band at @xmath71 ghz .",
    "this is justified by the case of 3c 219 at @xmath25 = 0.1744 ( comastri et al . 2003 ) , for which high frequency radio observations are available .",
    "the predicted ir flux of the template at 3.6@xmath72 m is @xmath32 7 @xmath7 10@xmath73 ergs@xmath10cm@xmath48 , in agreement with the non - detected emission at infrared and optical frequencies .",
    "the template is in agreement with the observed radio - to - x - ray luminosities measured in the lobe sample of c05 ( see figure 2(b ) and with the models adopted for the x - ray detected lobes of other friis ( e.g. , 3c 219 , comastri et al .",

    "we calculate the sed template with the luminosity ratio between the synchrotron and the ic / cmb component @xmath29 of the order of unity ( figure 2a ) .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that the energy losses for the radiative processes considered are equivalent , similar condition of @xmath26 @xmath3 1 , in agreement with the observations of friis ( see sect .",
    "2 ) . in addition , the x - ray spectral index is consistent with the typical slope observed for the few lobes for which a detailed spectral analysis exists ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 , c05 , isobe et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 , 2009 ) .",
    "the estimate of the total diffuse flux arising from the frii radio galaxy population can be evaluated adopting the following relation , as reported in ajello et al .",

    "the knowledge of the source lf is crucial to estimate correctly this contribution .",
    "indeed , it gives the space density of objects with luminosity @xmath81 at redshift @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt the frii radio galaxy lf at 15ghz ( cara & lister 2008 ) .",
    "the sed template used in equation ( 4 ) is renormalized such that at a given redshift @xmath25 the luminosity in the native radio band of the lf is @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , the ic component is multiplied by an additional factor @xmath82 to account for the fact that the energy density of the cmb scales like @xmath83 .",
    "the luminosity of the lf of cara & lister ( 2008 ) refers to the luminosity of the frii core while our sed template applies to the lobe emission . to convert the core luminosity into a proxy for the lobe luminosity at 15ghz we have used the available observations of frii ( c05 )",
    "we have found that rescaling the core luminosity by a factor @xmath84 ( and re - normalizing the sed template as described above ) produces seds that reproduce well the available data on friis for the range of source luminosities and redshifts reported in c05 .",
    "we randomly extracted sources from our model and selected only those with flux at 1kev @xmath15 10@xmath85erg cm@xmath48 s@xmath10 and @xmath86 .",
    "as shown in figure ( 2 ) our lf model is able to reproduce successfully the range of radio and x - ray luminosities of the c05 sample ( see figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "moreover , we performed an additional test integrating the lf coupled to our sed model over luminosity and redshift and we counted how many objects would be detectable in an all - sky survey above a flux of 10@xmath85erg cm@xmath48 s@xmath10 in the x - ray band .",
    "the number of detectable sources is @xmath3100 and they display a typical ( average ) x - ray luminosity of @xmath87erg cm@xmath48 s@xmath10 .",
    "these numbers appear to be consistent with the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _   observations ( e.g. , c05 ) . as an example , adopting a value for @xmath88 of 10@xmath10 or 10@xmath89 would produce @xmath34000 or @xmath31 observable sources in the entire sky .",
    "both these scenarios seem very unlikely given the observations described above .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties on @xmath88 adopting the following approach . to set a lower limit on k",
    ", we required that the number of detectable lobes all - sky ( estimated through equation ( 4 ) ) at 1kev , with flux @xmath15 10@xmath85erg cm@xmath48 s@xmath10 matches ( within 1@xmath90 ) the number of sources in the c05 sample .",
    "this condition is satisfied for @xmath91 .",
    "then , to set the upper limit , we request that the density of sources observable at x - rays ( same criteria as above ) matches the frii density at 178mhz in the complete sample of mullin et al .",
    "this condition is satisfied for @xmath92 .",
    "3 shows the contribution to the diffuse egb emission arising from the extended structures of frii lobes and its uncertainty .",
    "it is apparent that lobes give a significant , @xmath310% contribution to the egb in the mev energy range .",
    "in this letter , we adopted a statistical acceleration scenario based on turbulent magnetic fields to show that balancing the particle energy gain with the radiative losses , the expected lorentz factor is of the order of @xmath0 @xmath3 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 for electrons in the frii lobes , in agreement with the radio / millimeter observations of lobes in radio galaxies ( e.g. , hardcastle & looney 2008 ) .",
    "this has been estimated assuming that the acceleration length scale is comparable to the mean free path in the lobe not far from the equipartition condition , supported by the recent x - ray analyses of c05 .",
    "the above scenario is able to justify the presence of high - energy electrons responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission arising from the radio galaxy lobes , via ic / cmb , as the _ fermi",
    "_  observations of the nearby centaurus a ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "considering the ic / cmb scattering as the main radiative process for the emission in the mev energy range , we estimated the contribution of the friis to the diffuse egb .",
    "we found that the peak of this diffuse emission lies at @xmath3 1  mev and the radiation arising from lobes could contribute @xmath3 10% of the egb close to this energy .",
    "so far , the lobes in radio galaxies were only observable at radio frequencies and at high energies in the x - rays .",
    "this implies that the shape of the emitting ped is uncertain .",
    "consequently , the estimates of the lobe magnetic field and the possibility of identifying which is the most relevant radiative process , synchrotron or ic emission are not well constrained .",
    "however , current models adopted to describe the sed of lobes in friis assume the presence of high - energy electrons up to @xmath51 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 ( e.g. , c05 ) .    to test this hypothesis , very deep infrared and/or hard x - ray observations , with sufficient spatial resolution are necessary .",
    "if _ fermi _  will detect @xmath0-ray emission arising from nearby frii radio galaxies , these observations will be crucial to confirm the presence of high - energy electrons in radio lobes and to constrain their sed .",

    "<S> the recent discovery of the @xmath0-ray emission from the lobes of the closest radio galaxy centaurus a by _ fermi _  implies the presence of high - energy electrons at least up to @xmath1 - 10@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these high - energy electrons are required to interpret the observed @xmath0-ray radiation in terms of inverse compton emission off the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ) ; the widely accepted scenario to describe the x - ray emission of radio galaxy lobes . in this letter , we consider the giant radio lobes of fr ii radio galaxies showing that it is possible to maintain electrons at energies @xmath0 @xmath3 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath2 , assuming an acceleration scenario ( driven by turbulent magnetic fields ) that compensates the radiative losses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider the contribution to the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray background due to the ic / cmb emission of friis lobes showing its relevance in the kev to mev energy range . </S>"
