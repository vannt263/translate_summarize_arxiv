    "the gaas quantum well has a thickness of @xmath3 in sample a and @xmath4 in sample b ; it is followed by a thick @xmath89 barrier , which hosts a si @xmath90-doping located @xmath91 from the well .",
    "the two samples differ in carrier density and mobility , as reported in the main text .",
    "the hall bar devices ( @xmath92 wide and @xmath93 long ) are fabricated by uv lithography . ni / auge / ni / au metals are evaporated and annealed at @xmath7 to form ohmic contacts to the 2deg .",
    "the mesa is then defined by wet etching in acid solution .",
    "slg and blg flakes are produced by micromechanical exfoliation @xcite of graphite on @xmath94 @xmath0 on si substrates .",
    "the number of layers is identified by a combination of optical microscopy  @xcite and raman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the latter is also used to monitor the sample quality by measuring the d to g ratio  @xcite and the doping level  @xcite .",
    "selected flakes are then placed onto a gaas - based substrate at the center of a pre - patterned hall bar by using a polymer - based wet transfer process  @xcite .",
    "pmma ( molecular weight 950k ) is first spin coated onto the substrate with micromechanically cleaved flakes , then the sample is immersed in de - ionized water , resulting in the detachment of the polymer film because of water intercalation at the pmma - sio@xmath9 interface  @xcite .",
    "graphene flakes attach to the polymer and are removed from the @xmath95 substrate .",
    "the polymer+graphene film is then placed onto the target substrate and , after complete drying of the water , pmma is removed by acetone .",
    "success of the transfer is confirmed by optical inspection ( bright and dark field microscopy ) , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and raman spectroscopy .",
    "raman spectra are collected with a renishaw invia spectrometer using laser excitation wavelengths at @xmath96 .",
    "excitation power is kept below @xmath97 to avoid local heating and the scattered light is collected with a 100x objective .",
    "[ fig : stwo ] plots the spectra of slg and blg flakes before and after transfer .",
    "the strong luminescence background due to the gaas / algaas substrate has been subtracted out in order to highlight the raman signal of the slg / blg flakes after transfer .",
    "this , combined with the lack of interference enhancement on the gaas / algaas substrate , explains why the spectra of the transferred flakes are noisy .",
    "as discussed in the main text for the slg flake , also for the blg flake we do not see any increase of d peak , thus showing that the transfer procedure does not induce extra defects .",
    "since the flakes are much smaller than the hall bar widths , in each device we define a narrow channel ( @xmath98 ) in the hall bar by electron beam lithography ( ebl ) and wet etching , see figs .",
    "[ fig : sone]b)-c ) . to avoid exposure of the flakes to the electron beam",
    ", we took an optical image to align the ebl .",
    "this procedure is possible because slg and blg on this substrate become optically visible once coated by pmma , see fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] . finally , ohmic contacts ( cr / au ) are fabricated by ebl , metal evaporation and lift - off .",
    "as described in the main text , the anomalous quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in slg is seen at @xmath30 when the 2deg is _ not _ induced in the gaas channel ( see also black curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : sthree ] ) .",
    "a markedly different result is seen when the 2deg is induced by led illumination .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sthree ] , where we compare the hall resistance at @xmath99 as a function of the perpendicular magnetic field up to @xmath100 for the two cases .",
    "because of the massless dirac fermion nature of the charge carriers in slg and the spin - valley degeneracy , plateaus are expected  @xcite in the hall resistance at @xmath101 , with @xmath102 . when the 2deg is not induced , qhe plateaus are visible at @xmath103 while , as expected , the @xmath104 plateau is missing . in the other case , the plateau at @xmath105 is not visible and the resistance approaches the value for @xmath106 at the highest magnetic field .",
    "the two configurations have different mobility , @xmath107 , without the 2deg , @xmath108 with the 2deg .",
    "as explained in the main text , we can explain this difference considering that charged impurities ( ionized si donors ) are left in the heterostructure when the 2deg is induced , resulting in turn in an enhanced scattering of slg carriers , which reduces mobility  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the leakage current between the two layers are performed by applying a voltage source to the 2deg and detecting the current with an ammeter connected to slg / blg  @xcite .",
    "the applied voltage is negative to avoid depletion of the 2deg .",
    "we report in fig .  [",
    "fig : sfour ] the measured leakage currents for the slg and blg devices as a function of the inter - layer voltage .",
    "we recall that in the drag experiment configuration , the maximum negative value for this voltage is @xmath109 . in the case of slg ,",
    "the current is smaller than @xmath110 even at @xmath42 . in the case of blg",
    "we find a larger current at @xmath42 , but still much smaller than the drive current measured in the drag experiment ( in the worst case of @xmath17 we have a leakage current of @xmath111 while the drive current is @xmath112 ) . at the lowest temperature ,",
    "the leakage current in blg is smaller than the drive current by many orders of magnitude , so we do not expect it to affect the drag measurement  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath26 in slg as a function of the drive current @xmath25 in the 2deg is reported in fig .  [",
    "fig : sfive]a ) . upon reducing temperature",
    ", the drag voltage measured in slg displays a series of oscillations , which we believe to be linked to mesoscopic fluctuations already discussed in coulomb drag setups based on two spatially - separated slg sheets  @xcite and also for all gaas / algaas double layers  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations disappear for @xmath113 . above this temperature",
    "the @xmath26 - @xmath25 relation becomes linear .",
    "when the voltage drop is measured in the 2deg no fluctuations arise at all the explored temperatures : see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfive]b ) .",
    "this allows us to extract the evolution of the drag resistance down to @xmath114 ( see main text ) .",
    "a similar fluctuating behaviour of the drag voltage at low temperature is found in sample b in the configuration in which blg is used as the passive layer .",
    "we summarize the most elementary theory of drag resistance in the fermi - liquid regime  @xcite , which is based on boltzmann - transport theory supplemented by second - order perturbation theory in the screened inter - layer interaction  @xcite .    in the slg/2deg vertical heterostructure ,",
    "the drag resistivity @xmath115 is given , in the low - temperature limit , by  @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) is the fermi velocity in the top ( bottom ) layer , @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) is the fermi energy in the top ( bottom ) layer , @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is the fermi wave number in the top ( bottom ) layer , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
