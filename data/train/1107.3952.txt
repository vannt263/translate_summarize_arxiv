    "the standard model of the backwards diffusion problem is a case example of an _ exponentially ill - posed _ problem and it is related to several problems in tomography and image processing . for example , such problems have been studied in the articles  @xcite and books  @xcite to name but a few .",

    "recently , such a model has been developed and studied in  @xcite . by causality",
    "we understand that a characteristic feature of a process like an _ interface _ or a _ front _ must propagate with a finite speed @xmath3 .",

    "although a causal behavior is naturally demanded for problems involving hyperbolic equations , it is usually disregarded for problems involving parabolic equations .",
