    "the star ( hd 161741 ; @xmath10 = 17:48:47.603 , @xmath11= -35:03:25.63 , hipparcos main catalogue ) was recognized as an algol - type binary in the budding ( 1984 ) catalogue .",
    "an orbital period of 7.71249 days , dominant spectral type of b9 and temperatures of 10.080 @xmath2 and 6.350 @xmath2 for the primary and secondary star , are given by brancewicz & dworak ( 1980 , hereafter bd80 ) .",
    "the catalogue of approximate elements of eclipsing binaries by svechnikov & kuznetsova ( 1990 , hereafter sk90 ) gives a mass ratio of 0.45 with stellar masses of 3.00 and 1.35 for the primary and secondary star , respectively .",
    "these authors give b9 + [ f2 ] for the stellar components and an inclination of 79.0 degree for the binary .",
    "apart from the above references , the catalog of budding et al .",
    "( 2004 ) quotes @xmath12= 0.12 , where @xmath13 indicates a mass ratio calculated by using the secondary star radius and the assumption of semi - detached status .",
    "these authors also give b3iii for the primary with a reference to the hipparcos and tycho catalogues . from the above considerations",
    "is clear that there are inconsistencies in the basic stellar parameters published for v393sco .",
    "the star was observed as a transient radio source by stewart et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with maximum flux density at 8.4 ghz of 9.9 @xmath1 1.8 mjy .",
    "the star is also a 2mass source ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and has been observed by the msx6c infrared point source catalogue ( egan et al .",
    "is relatively bright , with a reported ( variable ) @xmath14 of around 7.5 mag .",
    "the ephemeris for the main minimum provided by kreiner ( 2004 ) is @xmath15 .",
    "v393 sco was briefly discussed by geraldine peters in her review on algol - type binaries ( 2001 ) .",
    "v393 sco was indicated with additional variability among the eclipsing binaries of the asas catalogue ( pilecki & szczygiel 2007 ) .",
    "this additional variability is typical of double periodic variables ( dpvs , mennickent et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter m03 , 2005 , 2008 , hereafter m08 , 2009a , 2009b , 2009c , hereafter m09 ) , with a period of 253.4 days , about 32.9 times the orbital period .",
    "we rapidly recognized as a galactic dpv and determined , from fourier decomposition of the asas @xmath14 light curve , an ephemeris for the maximum of the long cycle @xmath16 .    in our current interpretation of the dpv phenomenon ,",
    "the long cycle is interpreted as cycles of mass loss from the binary ( m08 , mennickent & koaczkowski 2009b ) .",
    "this mass loss is revealed , for instance , in the presence of discrete absorption components ( dacs ) in pa@xmath17 and pa@xmath18 in the lmc dpv ogle05155332 - 6925581 ( m08 ) . in this star the radial velocity and strength of the dacs follow a saw - teeth pattern with the orbital period that m08 interpreted in terms of mass loss from the outer lagrangian points .",
    "more recently , the long cycles of the galactic dpv aumon were interpreted as attenuation due to variable circumbinary material ( desmet et al .",
    "our observations of ogle05155332 - 6925581 motivated us to initiate an observing program looking for these features and similar behavior in the bright galactic dpv v393 sco , using the highest spectral resolution possible .",
    "at the same time , we also analyzed archival iue spectra to complement our view of the system .",
    "brief reports of our investigation have been published in conference proceedings ( m09 , michalska et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this paper",
    "we present results of our spectroscopic investigation of v393 sco at the infrared and ultraviolet spectral ranges , while additional optical spectroscopy and the study of the light curve will be presented in a separated paper .",
    "this publishing strategy of our rather large observational material has been chosen for the sake of order and paper compactness .",
    "our observations and methodology are summarized in section 2 , our results are given in section 3 , a discussion is presented in section 4 and we give our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we obtained 27 spectra of with the vlt cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph crires located at the nasmyth focus a of ut1 ( http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/ + paranal / instruments / crires/ ) between august 2008 and may 2009 .",
    "22 of these observations were labeled  completed `` and 5  executed '' by the observing team .",
    "these last observations , if not satisfying original demanded atmospheric conditions , still are useful for scientific analysis . a summary of our observations is given in table 1 .",
    "a slit width of 0.4provided a resolving power of 50.000 at the spectral range 1074 1099 nm . the nearby telluric stars hip087370",
    "( g3v ) and hip088154 ( g1v ) were observed before or after every science exposure , allowing to record the time dependent atmospheric absorption lines as close as possible ( in time and airmass ) to our spectra .",
    "we used the eso pipeline reduced spectra that are the result of collapsing many `` dithered '' short exposure spectra taken at different slit position in one single spectrum that is finally sky subtracted and wavelength calibrated .",
    "crires has four ccd cameras separated by wavelength gaps , yielding spectral segments ch1 to ch4 corresponding to regions 1074.01079.5 , 1081.01086.5 , 1088.01093.0 , and 1094.51099.0 nm , respectively .    for correction of telluric lines we used a variant of the procedure described in maiolino , rieke & rieke ( 1996 ) .",
    "we built our telluric templates by dividing the telluric spectra by a synthetic solar - type spectrum interpolated at the same resolution and wavelength range .",
    "we used the nso / kitt peak fts solar spectrum , produced by nsf / noao .",
    "then , we used the iraf telluric task to remove telluric absorption lines from the science objects by dividing from every science spectrum a scaled and wavelength centered version of the corresponding telluric spectrum .",
    "this method successfully removed telluric absorption lines from our spectra .",
    "however , we had to deal with an unexpected absorption character present in the telluric and science stars , a relatively wide feature around 1083 nm .",
    "this feature was not present in atlases of telluric absorption lines neither in the eso simulator of infrared atmospheric transmission .",
    "the character seems to be a telluric absorption , since it does not move with the earth translational motion , even at a target located near the galactic plane as v393 sco ( where variability of 40 km / s is expected for the time span of the observations ) .",
    "we discarded a problem with the reduction procedure since the character is present already in the raw data ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the complex shape of the feature suggests that it is not a ccd defect .",
    "the feature is variable in equivalent width ( @xmath19 ) , by 30% per epoch , but deeper in 2009 ( @xmath19= 0.066 nm ) than in 2008 ( @xmath19= 0.037 nm ) .",
    "regarding their nature , interstellar hei is expected at this wavelength ( scherb 1968 ) , but with lower intensity and with clear radial velocity variability in the raw data , that is not observed .",
    "we speculate that the feature could be hei formed in the upper earth atmosphere .    [ 1 ]    since the conventional method was not optimal for removing completely this feature , we developed a special procedure .",
    "we interpolated the continuum above this feature in the telluric spectra ( the region is deployed of telluric lines ) building a new telluric template , and then corrected only for the classical telluric lines our science objects in the usual way .",
    "this resulted in science objects with removed telluric lines except for the unknown character .",
    "we fit these spectra with high order polynomial excluding the region around the feature and then subtracted the observed spectrum producing the spectrum of the line alone .",
    "these line spectra were averaged per epoch producing a model for the line for 2008 and 2009 .",
    "we used these models to remove the feature from the science objects using the usual telluric line removal algorithm .",
    "the method resulted optimal for line removal .    for ch3 it was impossible to remove optimally the stellar spectrum from the telluric ones , probably due to small differences in wavelength scales which appear amplified by the high resolving power .",
    "for ch3 we cleaned our telluric spectra by removing a fit to the stellar lines made with a deblending algorithm considering a combination of voig profiles of variable depth , width and center . with this procedure we identified and removed 14 stellar lines below 99% of the continuum intensity level .",
    "then the remaining `` cleaned '' telluric spectra were removed from the science spectra using the usual telluric line removal algorithm .",
    "remaining ( usually single pixel ) outliers were rejected with a rejection algorithm interpolating fluxes between nearby pixels .",
    "all spectra discussed in this paper are corrected by the earth translational motion .",
    "the radial velocities are heliocentric ones .",
    "we use indifferently the words gainer / primary and donor / secondary .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      v393 sco shows a long photometric cycle of 255 days ( pilecki & szczygiel 2007 ) . our infrared spectroscopy span",
    "a small fraction of this cycle , only between phases 0.49 and 0.70 , so for this dataset is difficult to trace conclusions on the long cycle .",
    "distinct is the situation for the iue spectra , although few , they are very well sampled not only in orbital cycle but also in the long cycle as well .",
    "we have 7 spectra around @xmath20= 0.9 ( the maximum ) , two around @xmath20= 0.46 ( the minimum ) and one at @xmath20= 0.28 .",
    "the important result is that there is no major change between fluxes and line shape at these epochs ; the uv variability is mainly orbital , and large changes are not observed with the long cycle .",
    "this is clear when comparing the large fluxes detected at @xmath20= 0.92 ( swp36222 ) and @xmath20= 0.28 ( swp38632 ) and the very different fluxes detected at @xmath20= 0.93 ( swp36232 ) and @xmath20= 0.92 ( swp36222 ) .",
    "the same is true for the h@xmath6 emission , that is modulated with the orbital period , not the long cycle .",
    "the above fact must be contrasted with the know issue that long photometric variability is larger in redder bandpasses ( m03 , michalska et al .",
    "this suggests that high latitude hot outflows are not directly connected with the long cycle , and that the long cycle is more related to cooler mass outflows driven across the equatorial plane , not through the hotter polar regions .",
    "an additional point in favor of this view , is the fact that dpvs seen at intermediate latitudes , i.e. those showing ellipsoidal rather than eclipsing variability , do not show larger amplitude long cycles ( m03 ) .",
    "if matter is being expelled in the equatorial plane into the interstellar medium , a reservoir of gas could be formed around the binary , something like a circumbinary disk .",
    "actually , some evidence for this structure was found in the dpv olge05155332 - 6925581 by m08 .",
    "it is notable that for v393 sco we find no trace of additional infrared sources in our sed model .",
    "this could be a real feature of the system , but could also be due to oversimplification in our model , since we have not considered the circumprimary matter .",
    "a narrow l@xmath6 emission core , as seen in v393 sco , is also visible in the algol tthya ( miller at al .",
    "however , we note the absence of feii lines in the iue spectra of , especially in the aliii line region ; this contrasts with the observation of tt hya ( and @xmath18 per , wecht 2006 ) and could be due to a hotter pseudo - photosphere in v393 sco compared with those of classical algols .",
    "in addition , superionized emission lines are not observed in v393 sco , in contrast with the w serpentid type stars ryper ( in this star they are observed near totality , olson & plavec 1997 ) and @xmath18 lyr ( aydin et al . 1988 ) .",
    "finally , the uv lines detected in v393 sco are similar to those observed in other galactic dpv , au mon ( sahade & ferrer 1981 ) .",
    "all these observations point to hot regions with different temperatures in algols , dpvs and w serpentids , and support the view that these classes are interacting binaries with different mass transfer rates regimes ( mennickent et al .",
    "an exhaustive comparative analysis of all available uv spectra for algols , dpvs and w serpentids is needed to confirm this point , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .    one important question to rise here is why v393 sco looses matter into the interstellar medium whereas others low @xmath21 algols apparently do not . in all low @xmath21 semi - detached algols accretion can form a disk around the gainer .",
    "m08 speculated that in dpvs the mass transfer rate @xmath22 is so large than the primary rapidly spin up until critical rotation , and material can not be longer be accreted onto the primary , starting to escape from the system through places of minimum binding energy , like the @xmath23 point .",
    "how the long cycle is produced , and the question if it represents cycles of enhanced mass loss as proposed by m08 , still are matters of research , but precession of the circumprimary envelope or some rotational instability at the primary have been invoked as possible causes ( mennickent et al .",
    "2009a , mennickent et al .",
    "alternatively , for the dpv aumon , peters ( 1994 ) interpreted the long cyclic activity as due to variable mass transfer caused by a slow pulsation of the secondary about its roche surface . an open question is how the hitherto transient radio flares detected in v393 sco are related with the long cycle .",
    "radio flares are probable indicators of activity in the secondary star ( e.g. retter , richards & wu 2005 ) .",
    "evidently , more research at these wavelengths is needed to have a complete picture of the role of the secondary star in the long cycles of v393 sco .",
    "based on a study of infrared and uv spectra of v393 sco , along with published multiwavelength broad band photometry , we conclude : +    * the fit to the sed of v393 sco with two stellar models allowed to calculate the stellar temperatures , surface gravities , color excess and distance that are given in table 7 .",
    "our study of rvs of infrared hei , mgii lines and uv resonance lines yielded a mass ratio @xmath21= 0.25 . * based on the larger distance ( @xmath5= 523 @xmath1 60 pc ) and reddening ( @xmath4= 0.13 @xmath1 0.02 ) , we argue that v393 sco is not a member of the cluster m7 . *",
    "the blue depression observed in hei 1083 profile around secondary eclipse suggests the existence of mass loss through the lagrangian @xmath23 point with velocities @xmath24 300 km / s .",
    "this material probably does not return to the system and it is lost into the interstellar medium . * the hei 1083 asymmetry around @xmath25= 0.5 is comparable in strength to the asymmetry observed around @xmath25= 0.9 ( a diagnostic of the gas stream ) , suggesting that a large fraction of the accreted matter is lost into the interstellar medium during @xmath20= 0.49 - 0.70 . *",
    "the general variability of hei 1083 , especially the width changes , indicates the presence of a hot optically thick envelope or pseudo - photosphere that mimics the appearance of a hot b - type primary .",
    "we argue that this region is asymmetrical and dominates the 3th and 4th quadrants .",
    "the irregularities observed in the hei profile during the orbital cycle suggests that matter in this circumprimary envelope posses a complex dynamics , and is not rotating at keplerian velocities around the primary . * as circumprimary matter was not included in our sed model , caution must be taken when considering the derived stellar parameters .",
    "* asymmetries seen in superionized uv lines at almost all observed orbital phases point to the existence of a permanent hot wind at high latitudes .",
    "this wind is associated to the hotter star , has velocity @xmath26 500 km / s and is an important mass loss channel for the binary . *",
    "contrary to wser stars , we report the absence of high ionization emission lines in the uv spectrum of v393 sco .",
    "the uv spectra of wserpentids , dpvs and algols could reveal distinctive features .",
    "* the low amplitude of uv continuum / line variations during long cycle , argue against polar jets as the cause for the long - term variability . the long - term variability is probably related to equatorial mass loss . * two additional arguments supporting this view",
    "are : ( 1 ) the similitude between long - term amplitudes observed in non - eclipsing and eclipsing dpvs by m03 and ( 2 ) the reported larger amplitude in red bandpasses for the long cycles .",
