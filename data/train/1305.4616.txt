    "in this paper , we consider the following fractional @xmath0-hardy inequalities : @xmath1 we say that an open set @xmath2 admits an @xmath0-hardy inequality , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , if there is a constant @xmath5 such that inequality   holds for every @xmath6 . throughout the paper",
    ", we consider only proper open subsets @xmath7 , and therefore the boundary @xmath8 is always non - empty .",
    "one of our starting points is a result of dyda @xcite that a bounded lipschitz domain admits an @xmath0-hardy inequality if and only if @xmath9 . this can be viewed as an analogue of a result of neas  @xcite , stating that if @xmath10 is a bounded lipschitz domain and @xmath4 , then there is @xmath5 such that the @xmath11-hardy inequality @xmath12 holds for all @xmath6 . for the @xmath11-hardy inequality",
    "it is well understood that the lipschitz assumption can be weakened significantly : a canonical sufficient condition is that the complement of @xmath10 is @xmath13-uniformly fat ; we refer here to the works of lewis  @xcite and wannebo  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it follows easily from the ideas in  @xcite and  @xcite that if the complement of an open set @xmath10 is @xmath0-uniformly fat , then a ` global ' version of the @xmath0-hardy inequality  , namely the inequality @xmath14 holds for every @xmath6 ; here we understand that functions in @xmath15 are extended as @xmath16 outside @xmath10 ; see section  [ s.applications ] for more details .",
    "the main objective of our present work is to examine how much the lipschitz condition can be relaxed without losing the ` localization ' in inequality  . in other words",
    ", we aim to determine what kind of assumptions on @xmath10 allow for the restriction of the integration in the right - hand side of   to the set @xmath17 . based on a comparison with the @xmath11-hardy inequality  , a natural first candidate for",
    "such a condition would be the complement of @xmath10 being @xmath0-uniformly fat .",
    "however , already the example of dyda  @xcite gives an open set @xmath10 whose complement is @xmath0-uniformly fat for all @xmath18 and @xmath3 , but where @xmath0-hardy inequalities fail if @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , one can simply take @xmath10 to be the unit ball of @xmath20 , or any other bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "notice that in this case the _ boundary _ of @xmath10 is locally @xmath0-uniformly fat only when @xmath9 .",
    "hence one could ask if it is sufficient for inequality   that the boundary is ( locally ) @xmath0-uniformly fat .",
    "again , it turns out that the answer is negative , at least in the range @xmath21 , as we provide in section  [ s.counterexamples ] examples of open sets whose boundaries are ( locally ) @xmath0-uniformly fat , but which still fail to admit @xmath0-hardy inequalities .",
    "the obstruction in our examples is that even though the boundary is uniformly fat , most of it is not ` visible ' from within the set .",
    "hence it seems that a right way to generalize the result of dyda  @xcite beyond lipschitz domains is to apply conditions which combine both fatness and geometry of the boundary . in our main result ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : fractional_hardy_visible ] , we follow  @xcite and use a local _ visual boundary condition _ given in terms of john curves . an illustrative consequence of theorem  [ thm : fractional_hardy_visible ] is the following sufficient condition for uniform domains .",
    "[ cor : fractional_hardy_uniform ] let @xmath3 and @xmath22 be such that @xmath23 .",
    "assume that @xmath24 is a ( bounded ) uniform domain with a ( locally ) @xmath0-uniformly fat boundary .",
    "then @xmath10 admits an @xmath0-hardy inequality .    besides bounded lipschitz domains ( for @xmath9 ) and domains above the graphs of lipschitz functions ( also considered by dyda  @xcite ) , corollary  [ cor : fractional_hardy_uniform ] covers , for instance , the domain @xmath25 bounded by the usual von koch snowflake curve of hausdorff dimension @xmath26 , or , in fact , any domain inside an analogous curve of any dimension @xmath27 .",
    "it is indeed well known that these domains are uniform .",
    "moreover , the boundary of such a domain @xmath10 is a @xmath28-regular set , and therefore the boundary is locally @xmath0-uniformly fat for @xmath29 ( cf.proposition  [ t.lambda_sets_are_fat ] ) .",
    "it then follows from corollary  [ cor : fractional_hardy_uniform ] that @xmath10 admits an @xmath0-hardy inequality if ( and only if ) @xmath29 .",
    "( for the converse , we refer to  @xcite and the estimates in section  [ s.sel ] . ) nevertheless , without going into the details in this section , we mention that theorem  [ thm : fractional_hardy_visible ] can be applied to far more general open sets than just uniform domains .",
    "let us also remark that in the recent paper  @xcite , related fractional hardy inequalities are studied using different methods .",
    "one consequence of the general framework in  @xcite is that in corollary  [ cor : fractional_hardy_uniform ] the assumption that @xmath10 is uniform can actually be replaced by a plumpness condition for @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , our theorem  [ thm : fractional_hardy_visible ] can be applied to many non - plump cases in which the results in  @xcite do not apply directly , for instance to domains having outer cusps .",
    "fractional hardy inequalities , and their generalizations , have been enjoying a reasonable amount of interest during the last few years .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that they can be used to deliver spectral information on the generators of the so - called censored stable processes ; see e.g.  @xcite , and the references therein , for more details .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned results and references , loss and sloane  @xcite established fractional hardy type inequalities with sharp constants , but they used different distance functions in the left - hand side of  .",
    "however , in a convex domain @xmath10 their distance functions are majorized by @xmath30 , and thus one obtains sharp fractional inequalities   for convex domains .",
    "dyda and frank  @xcite further improved the results of loss and sloane into the so - called fractional hardy  sobolev  mazya inequalities .",
    "see also  @xcite for related results . for one - dimensional fractional hardy inequalities we refer to  (",
    "* chapter  5 ) and the references therein . in the present paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves completely to the case where the boundary of @xmath10 is ` thick ' , for instance in the sense of the uniform fatness condition . on the other hand , it is well - known that hardy inequalities , in general , can be valid also when the boundary ( or the complement ) is ` thin ' enough . for fractional hardy inequalities , the thin case has been examined systematically in @xcite ; the work of dyda  @xcite contains some particular instances of thin complements as well .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section  [ s.notation ] we provide definitions , notation , and other basic tools ; for instance , the definition of uniform fatness , based on riesz capacities , and the different john and uniformity conditions related to the visibility can be found here .",
    "section  [ s.comparison ] contains comparison results for various density conditions .",
    "in particular , we relate conditions given in terms of capacities ( as in uniform fatness ) to conditions for hausdorff contents . our main result , theorem  [ thm : fractional_hardy_visible ] , is stated and proved in section  [ s.proof_main ] .",
    "the proof is based on a combination of ` pointwise hardy ' techniques developed in  @xcite and maximal function arguments , similar to those in  @xcite . in section  [ s.counterexamples ]",
    "we construct the counterexamples showing that @xmath0-uniform fatness of the boundary @xmath31 does not suffice for @xmath10 to admit an @xmath0-hardy inequality .",
    "we close the paper in section  [ s.applications ] with some applications and additional results related to the extension of functions in the fractional sobolev space @xmath32 and to the removability of sets with respect to @xmath0-hardy inequalities .",

    "we write @xmath550\\times [ 0,2])\\setminus e_m\\big)\\cap g\\quad\\text { and } \\quad   q_m^3=\\big(([-3,3]\\times [ 0,3])\\setminus e_m\\big)\\cap g.\\ ] ] then , with simple manipulations and the fact that @xmath529 outside of the set @xmath530\\times[0,2]$ ] , we find @xmath551 by the properties of snowflake curves , the set @xmath552 is quasiconvex ; that is , all pairs @xmath553 can be joined by a curve @xmath554 such that @xmath555 .",
    "thus @xmath556 for all @xmath553 by property  ( 4 ) of the functions @xmath400 , and so @xmath557 finally , @xmath558 where we used also the fact that @xmath520\\times[0,-1 ] { \\subset}g^c$ ] . by the above calculations we conclude that , indeed , @xmath559 where the constant @xmath121 is independent of @xmath402 .",
    "consequently , @xmath10 can not admit @xmath0-hardy inequalities for @xmath521 .",
    "let us now consider a domain @xmath25 such that @xmath560 , where @xmath371 is a snowflake domain with @xmath561 ( cf .",
    "section  [ s.sel ] ) and @xmath494 is a fat cantor set ( cf .  section  [ s.aux_compact ] ) placed inside @xmath371 in such a way that @xmath562 .",
    "then the boundary of @xmath10 is locally @xmath0-uniformly fat whenever @xmath29 , and so in particular for @xmath388 , but we will show that @xmath10 can not admit @xmath0-hardy inequalities when @xmath388 .    for simplicity , we may assume that @xmath563 with @xmath564\\times [ 0,1]$ ] , as constructed in section  [ s.sel ] , and that @xmath565 . for each @xmath449 , let @xmath566 be the @xmath567th level cube in the construction of @xmath494 ( with side length @xmath568 ) satisfying @xmath569 .",
    "the idea is to place above each @xmath570 a scaled copy of a suitable function @xmath400 , @xmath571 , from section  [ s.local halfspace ] with @xmath522 .",
    "more precisely , the cube @xmath572\\times[1,1+\\ell_{k}/2]$ ] corresponds now to the cube @xmath520\\times [ 0,3]$ ] ; the line segment from @xmath573 to @xmath574 corresponds to @xmath575 of section  [ s.local halfspace ] ; and the functions @xmath400 are scaled accordingly . if @xmath576 , where @xmath577 gives the relative width of the ` corridor ' in the @xmath578th level of the construction of @xmath494 , then estimate  , when applied to these scaled copies of @xmath400 in @xmath572\\times[1,1+\\ell_{k}/2]$ ] , yields @xmath579 notice , however , that for a fixed @xmath567 this estimate is not true when @xmath580 , since then also the small corridors in @xmath581 influence the factor @xmath30 in the integral .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of the @xmath0-hardy inequality are scaled with the factor @xmath582 , too .",
    "estimates for the integrals corresponding to @xmath583 and @xmath584 from section  [ s.local halfspace ] are valid as such , and thus these terms are bounded by @xmath585 . however , in estimate   for the integral @xmath586 we used the fact that @xmath520\\times[0,-1 ] { \\subset}g^c$ ] , but the corresponding claim is clearly not true in the present setting ; in fact , @xmath587 is even a dense set . to overcome this , we need to be a bit more careful when estimating this last integral .    we choose @xmath588 , and thus @xmath589 for all @xmath449 . by lemma  [ l.diff ]",
    ", we know that then @xmath590\\times[1,1+\\ell_{k}/2]$ ] denote the obvious analogs of @xmath591 and @xmath552 . then we can estimate the integral corresponding to @xmath586 as @xmath592 where we used   and the fact that @xmath593 when @xmath594 and @xmath595 .",
    "thus , for @xmath596 , the integral above is bounded by @xmath582 , as desired . moreover , with this choice we have @xmath597 , which was the only requirement for estimate   to hold . in conclusion , the @xmath0-hardy inequality can not be valid for functions @xmath598 , @xmath599 , with a uniform constant , and hence the domain @xmath10 can not admit @xmath0-hardy inequalities when @xmath388 .",
    "let us briefly indicate how to obtain similar counterexamples when @xmath390 .",
    "the value @xmath388 above corresponds to the fact that the fat cantor set is , loosely speaking , seen as one - dimensional when observed from a suitable distance from within the domain ; here @xmath600 .",
    "similarly , if we had a locally @xmath0-uniformly fat part of the boundary that is seen as @xmath28-dimensional , with @xmath601 , then @xmath0-hardy inequalities would fail .",
    "such a situation can be obtained , for instance , by placing a snowflake type set @xmath602 , indicated in figure  3 , inside a suitable @xmath371-domain .",
    "notice , however , that the set in figure  3 is based on a very simple approximation of the actual snowflake curve @xmath517 .     with tunnels .",
    "the support of the test function @xmath603 is drawn above the snowflake rhombus @xmath604.,width=453 ]    more precisely , to obtain such a set @xmath602 , we first consider the set bounded by a snowflake curve @xmath517 of dimension @xmath27 and its reflection on the @xmath605-axis , and then remove ` tunnels ' ( the black parts in figure  3 ) of width @xmath606 : one large tunnel of width @xmath607 , four tunnels of width @xmath608 , etc .",
    "it is clear that if we choose @xmath609 to be small enough , then the resulting set @xmath602 is still @xmath374-regular , and thus locally @xmath0-uniformly fat for any @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "if the boundary of the surrounding @xmath371-domain has dimension greater than @xmath28 , it follows that the boundary of @xmath610 is locally @xmath0-uniformly fat for @xmath521 .",
    "now , let @xmath611 denote the large ` snowflake rhombus ' in the middle of @xmath517 . then choose @xmath604 to be the second largest rhombus on the left - hand side of @xmath612 ; and @xmath613 to be the third largest rhombus on the left - hand side of @xmath604 ; and so on .",
    "just like in the counterexample of section  [ s.local cantor ] with the fat cantor set , we place scaled copies of the functions @xmath400 from section  [ s.local halfspace ] ( constructed with respect to the corresponding @xmath517 ) above the sets @xmath614 ; cf .  figure  3 . with computations analogous to those in section  [ s.local cantor ] ( we leave the details to the reader )",
    ", it follows that , for @xmath521 , @xmath10 can not admit @xmath0-hardy inequalities , and yet @xmath10 is a domain having a locally @xmath0-uniformly fat boundary .",
    "this finishes the proof of the second claim of theorem  [ t.counter ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with extension and removability problems related to fractional hardy inequalities and fractional sobolev spaces . for @xmath3 and @xmath615 , the _ fractional sobolev space _ @xmath616 is defined as the space of functions @xmath617 with @xmath618 , where @xmath619 see @xcite for a nice introduction and basic properties of the spaces @xmath616 .",
