    "among the many exotic properties of topological insulators @xcite , the prediction @xcite that they can host majorana zero - modes stands out both for its fundamental interest and for possible applications in topological quantum computing @xcite .",
    "to braid majoranas is the prize - winning experiment , since it would identify them as a fundamentally new type of quasiparticles with non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "the road towards this goal has several milestones , starting from the detection of the zero - mode itself @xcite .",
    "one intermediate milestone is the construction of a qubit out of majorana zero - modes and the measurement of its coherence times .",
    "this would be essential information for a subsequent braiding experiment to demonstrate its non - abelian nature .",
    "here we describe a minimal circuit that can initialize , rotate , and read - out the majorana qubit by coupling it to a transmon ( a superconducting charge qubit in a microwave transmission line resonator @xcite ) .",
    "this is the hybrid topological - transmon qubit ( _ top - transmon _ ) introduced in ref .  .",
    "the circuit we propose here for the characterization of the majorana qubit is a reduced version of the full braiding circuit of ref .  .",
    "by sacrificing the possibility to perform topologically protected operations , we now need only 4 and not 6 majoranas . for an early generation of experiments",
    "this might well be a significant simplification .",
    "the reduced circuit shares with the full circuit the feature that all operations are performed by control over coulomb interactions rather than tunneling @xcite .",
    "this control is achieved by external variation of magnetic fluxes through macroscopic josephson junctions , without requiring microscopic control over tunnel couplings .",
    "we focus on majorana zero - modes induced by the superconducting proximity effect at the edge of a quantum spin - hall insulator @xcite , motivated by recent experimental progress in this direction @xcite .",
    "relative to the nanowire realization @xcite , this system has several favorable properties ( single - mode conduction , insensitivity to disorder ) .",
    "it also brings along some challenges ( how to confine the majoranas , how to make a t - junction ) , that we propose to overcome along the lines suggested in ref .  .",
    "through a josephson junction . ]    before proceeding to a description in the next section of the minimal circuit that can operate on a majorana qubit , we summarize the basic ingredients . the device is a hybrid structure @xcite , dubbed a _",
    "top - transmon _ , combining a topological qubit formed out of majorana zero - modes with a nontopological transmon qubit .    the basic building block of the transmon , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_transmon ] , is a cooper pair box @xcite ( a superconducting island with charging energy @xmath0 @xmath1 josephson energy @xmath2 ) coupled to a microwave transmission line ( coupling energy @xmath3 ) .",
    "the plasma frequency @xmath4 is modulated by an amount @xmath5 upon variation of the charge @xmath6 induced on the island by a gate voltage @xmath7 . additionally , there is a @xmath6-dependent contribution @xmath8 to the ground state energy .",
    "the charge sensitivity @xmath9 can be adjusted by varying the flux @xmath10 enclosed by the josephson junction , which modulates the josephson energy @xmath11 . in a typical device @xcite , a variation of @xmath10 between @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "changes @xmath14 by several orders of magnitude , so the charge sensitivity can effectively be switched on and off by increasing the flux by half a flux quantum .    including also the coupling to the microwave photons ( creation operator @xmath15 at resonant frequency @xmath16 ) , the hamiltonian of the transmon has the form @xcite @xmath17 the charge qubit is represented by pauli matrices @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "majorana zero - modes are represented by identical creation and annihilation operators @xmath20 , with anticommutation relation @xmath21 the number of majoranas on a superconducting island is necessarily even , say @xmath22 .",
    "they encode a topological quantum number , which is the @xmath23 eigenvalue of the fermion parity operator @xcite @xmath24 the top - transmon hamiltonian @xmath25 contains a term @xmath26 that couples the charge qubit to the topological qubit , see ref .   for a derivation .",
    "since majorana fermions are charge - neutral particles ( being their own antiparticle ) , one may ask how there can be any coupling at all .",
    "the answer is that the state of the @xmath22 zero - modes in a superconducting island depends on the parity of the number of electrons on that island , and it is this dependence on the electrical charge modulo @xmath27 that provides for a flux - controlled coulomb coupling between the majoranas .",
    "a measurement of the resonance frequency @xmath28 of the transmission line now becomes a joint projective measurement of the charge qubit and topological qubit @xcite , @xmath29 this measurement is performed far off resonance ( @xmath30 , the socalled dispersive regime ) , so the charge qubit is not excited .",
    "if it is in the ground state we may just replace @xmath31 and @xmath28 directly measures @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , a shift in the resonance frequency signals a bit - flip of the topological qubit .",
    ". in the linear layout ( panel a ) the coupling between majoranas on different islands is via a tunnel barrier ( thick horizontal line ) , requiring gate voltage control . by using a tri - junction ( panel",

    "the conservation of fermion parity on a single superconducting island implies a minimum of two islands for a majorana qubit , each containing a pair of majorana zero - modes . the minimal circuit that can operate on a majorana qubit",

    "the topological qubit is rotated by coupling it to a cooper pair box in a transmission line resonator ( _ transmon _ ) .",
    "the coupling strength is controlled by the magnetic flux @xmath10 through a pair of split josephson junctions .",
    "the diagrams at the top indicate how the coulomb couplings of pairs of majoranas are switched on and off : they are _ off _ ( solid line ) when @xmath34 and _ on _ ( dashed line ) when @xmath35 .",
    "this single - qubit rotation does not have topological protection , it serves to characterize the coherence times of the majorana qubit . ]",
    "three superconducting islands allow for two independent charge differences , so they produce two charge qubits @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these are coupled to four majorana zero - modes @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",

    "we have ignored the higher - lying fermionic modes at the tri - junction , see the appendix for a calculation that includes these .    without loss of generality",
    ", we will fix the overall parity to be even .",
    "the majorana qubit then has the two states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in terms of the occupation number of the fermionic modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "each of the two couplings @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be varied between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , by variation of the flux between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this circuit does not allow to implement braiding ( not enough adjustable couplings ) .",
    "however , it does allow for a complete characterisation of the majorana qubit .    for starters",
    ", one can demonstrate that the four majoranas constitute a quantum mechanical two - level system , by following these two steps .",
    "the first step is the initialization of the qubit in an eigenstate of @xmath58 , by setting @xmath59 , @xmath60 and waiting for the system to relax to its ground state ; or alternatively , one can perform a projective measurement onto a @xmath58 eigenstate via microwave irradiation of the transmon qubit @xcite . once the qubit is initialised , the second step is to set @xmath61 .",
    "the qubit will then start to rotate around the @xmath62-axis of the bloch sphere at a frequency @xmath63 .",
    "this rabi oscillation can be detected via a shift in the resonant frequency of the microwave transmission line .",
    "since the hamiltonian is that of a fully controllable qubit , and since we are allowed to measure @xmath58 , all usual qubit tests can be performed . in particular ,",
    "the coherence times @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be measured .",
    "the switching time @xmath64 will likely be dominated by quasiparticle poisoning when all coulomb couplings are _ off _ ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the intrinsic coherence time @xmath65 is usually measured via a ramsey fringe experiment , applying two @xmath67 rotations around the @xmath62-axis separated by a time delay @xmath68 , while keeping @xmath69 _ on _ so that the two qubit states are separated in energy . in the time interval between the @xmath67 pulses ,",
    "the qubit rotates freely around the @xmath70-axis . a measurement of @xmath58 after the second pulse should result in decaying oscillations as a function of @xmath68 , allowing to determine @xmath65 . in principle",
    ", such measurements can also be used to determine @xmath71 and @xmath72 through the period of the ramsey fringes .",
    "the characteristic energy scales of the two charge qubits are the magnetic flux dependent josephson energy @xmath73 and the charging energy @xmath0 , which give a plasma frequency @xmath74 .",
    "the josephson and charging energies may or may not be the same on the two islands , that does not matter for the operation of the circuit .    for the sake of generality we allow for an asymmetry @xmath75 in the arms of the split josephson junction , leading to a flux - dependence @xcite @xmath76 typical values of @xmath75",
    "are in the 10% range .",
    "hence , for @xmath77 one obtains @xmath78 . in the transmon regime",
    "one has @xmath79    for a flux - controlled coupling of the majorana zero - modes we require that the inter - island tunnel coupling @xmath33 ( across the constriction in fig .",
    "[ fig_qubit ] ) and the intra - island coulomb coupling satisfy @xcite @xmath80 the inequalities involving @xmath33 should not be interpreted too strictly , in particular since we do not require @xmath33 to be under accurate experimental control . in the appendix",
    "we show that @xmath33 can vary in a large energy window without compromising the functionality of the device",

    "let us now turn to the parameters of the microwave cavity .",

    "the initialization of the ancillas also requires that @xmath103 , so the coulomb coupling @xmath57 can not be much smaller than @xmath104 .",
    "there is no such requirement for the simpler circuit of fig .",
    "[ fig_qubit ] , because no ancillas are needed for the nontopological rotation of a majorana qubit .",
    "this is one reason , in addition to the smaller number of majoranas , that we propose this circuit for the first generation of experiments on majorana qubits .",
    "the key ingredients of the top - transmon @xcite are : 1 ) a charge qubit to couple majorana zero - modes ; 2 ) a flux - controlled josephson junction to switch the coulomb coupling _ on _ and _ off _ ; 3 ) a microwave resonator to read out the majorana qubit . there",
    "exist many alternative proposals to operate on majorana qubits @xcite , including an alternative hybrid design that uses a flux qubit instead of a charge qubit @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a great variety of candidate systems that could host the majoranas .",
    "three stand out as being closest to experimental realization : 1 ) semiconductor nanowires @xcite ; 2 ) chains of magnetic nanoparticles @xcite ; 3 ) the quantum spin - hall edge @xcite .",
    "all three systems can be integrated with a transmon device , see for example fig .  [ fig_braiding ] for a circuit that can braid the majoranas via a pair of constrictions in a quantum spin - hall insulator .",
    "the braiding operation is called `` topologically protected '' because ideally the error is of order @xmath105 and can be made exponentially small @xcite .",
    "larger errors are to be expected in the first generation of experiments , caused by quasiparticle poisoning @xcite , nonadiabatic effects @xcite , nonequilibrium noise @xcite , and coupling of the majoranas to localized low - energy states induced by disorder @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle poisoning time may well remain as the ultimate limiting factor  times @xmath106 have been reported in al - cu devices @xcite , but the quantum spin - hall insulator is likely to be less favorable .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_qubit ] and [ fig_braiding ] we showed an implementation of the top - transmon circuits at the quantum spin - hall edge , because of recent experimental developments that suggest this might be a favorable host of majorana zero - modes @xcite .",
    "the role of t - junctions @xcite , which in nanowire networks can be fabricated by allowing nanowires to meet and merge during the growth process @xcite , is played by constrictions @xcite , but since a constriction has four legs rather than three , one of the edges has to be closed off by a barrier .",
    "this will require breaking of the time - reversal symmetry that prevents backscattering of the helical edge states @xcite .",
    "the weak - field barriers suggested in ref .",
    "will presumably not be sufficiently resistive to realize the braiding operation .",
    "the alternative is to open up a gap at the edge by a ferromagnetic insulator or by an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "ref .   found no gap opening in their inas / gasb quantum wells for in - plane fields up to 10  t , but this might be strongly dependent on the detailed stucture of the quantum wells .",
    "this contribution builds on the collective effort of the top - transmon team at leiden university , as reported in refs .  .",

    "two simplifying assumptions are made in this hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "<S> we construct a minimal circuit , based on the _ top - transmon _ design , to rotate a qubit formed out of four majorana zero - modes at the edge of a two - dimensional topological insulator . unlike braiding operations , generic rotations have no topological protection , but they do allow for a full characterization of the coherence times of the majorana qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation is controlled by variation of the flux through a pair of split josephson junctions in a cooper pair box , without any need to adjust gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> the rabi oscillations of the majorana qubit can be monitored via oscillations in the resonance frequency of the microwave cavity that encloses the cooper pair box . </S>",
    "<S> + contribution for the proceedings of the nobel symposium on topological insulators . </S>"
