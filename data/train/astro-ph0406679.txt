    "the detailed knowledge of the present day galactic disk abundance gradient and its evolution with time is one of the basic ingredients of any chemical evolution model which aims to predict the properties of the galactic disk ( @xcite and references therein ) . compared to other indicators ( hii regions , b stars , planetary nebulae and cepheids ) , old open clusters ( ocs )",

    ", renewed efforts to probe the chemical abundances in old ocs have taken place , by means of high resolution spectroscopy of member stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , the galactic disk radial abundance gradients @xcite mostly rely on medium resolution spectra , and the derived metallicities turned out to be quite different in several cases when high resolution spectra are available ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ an additional drawback stems from the fact that it is quite common to consider the radial abundance gradient observed in the solar vicinity as representative of the whole disk , due to the lack of metallicity estimates in very distant ocs .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to obtain information on the chemical compositions of old ocs spanning the widest possible range in galactocentric distances , covering in particular the relatively unexplored outer disk of the galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present high resolution spectra of four giant stars in the old ocs berkeley 29 and saurer 1 . according to @xcite and @xcite these two objects are the most distant ocs insofar detected in the milky way ( beyond 19 kpcs from the galactic center ) , although the precise distances are not yet very well known , due to uncertainties in the reddening and metallicity .",
    "in fact only photometric estimates of the metallicity are available for these clusters , which are based mainly on isochrone fitting or comparison with other oprn clusters .",
    "@xcite reports for berkeley  29 an age of 4 gyrs and and the very low metal content @xmath0 \\approx -1.0 $ ] , while @xcite report for saurer  1 an age of 5 gyrs and a metal content @xmath0 \\approx -0.5 $ ] thus , they represent very useful targets to probe the metal abundance of the galactic disk outskirts , allowing us to significantly enlarge the distance baseline of the radial abundance gradient . here",
    "we present new metallicity estimates for the two clusters and derive updated estimates of their age and distance , and discuss their role in shaping the radial abundance gradient .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is as follows . section  2 and 3 illustrate observations and reduction strategies , while section  4 deals with radial velocity determinations . in section  5",
    "we derive the stellar abundances and in section  6 we revise the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "the results of this paper are then discussed in section  7 and , finally , summarized in section  8 .",

    "the hires spectrograph @xcite on the keck i telescope was used with a 1.15 x 7 arcsec slit to provide a spectral resolution r = 34,000 in the wavelength range 5720@xmath18160   in 19 different orders on the 2048@xmath22048 ccd detector .",
    "a blocking filter was used to remove second@xmath3order contamination from blue wavelengths .",
    "three exposures of 2400 seconds were obtained for the two stars in berkeley  29 . for saurer  1@xmath391 and saurer",
    "1@xmath3122 we took two exposures of 3000 and 2700 seconds , respectively . for the wavelength calibration , spectra of a thorium@xmath3argon lamp were secured after the set of exposures for each star was completed . the radial velocity standard hd  26162",
    "was observed at the beginning of the night , together with the spectrophotometric standard g191b2b .",
    "+ in fig .  1 we show a finding chart for the two clusters where the four observed stars are indicated , while in fig .",
    "2 we show the position of the stars in the color@xmath3magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "images were reduced using iraf , including bias subtraction , flat@xmath3field correction , extraction of spectral orders , wavelength and flux calibration , and continuum subtraction .",
    "the single orders were merged into a single spectrum and the spectra of each star were combined to remove cosmic rays .",
    "a spectral region containing a large number of telluric lines was instead used to correct the spectra for flexures of the instrument and off@xmath3center slit pointing ; the error on this correction was about 0.05 km s@xmath4 .",
    "an example of sprectrum , with a few line indicated , is shown in fig .",
    "no radial velocity estimates are available for berkeley  29 and saurer  1 .",
    "the radial velocities of the target stars were measured using the iraf fxcor task , which cross@xmath3correlates the object spectrum with the template ( hd  26162 ) ; the peak of the cross@xmath3correlation was fitted with a gaussian curve after rejecting spectral regions contaminated by telluric lines ( @xmath5   ) . in order to check our wavelength calibration we also measured the radial velocity of hd  26162 itself , using the doppler shifts of various spectral lines .",
    "we obtained a radial velocity of 24.8@xmath60.1 km s@xmath4 , which perfectly matches the catalogue value ( 24.8 km / sec , @xcite ) .",
    "the final error in the radial velocities was typically about 0.1 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the two stars we measured in each clusters have compatible radial velocities ( see table  1 ) , and are considered , therefore , _ bona fide _ cluster members .",

    "this software has the advantage of providing a graphical visualisation of the continuum and of the measured width .",
    "repeated measurements show a typical error of about 4@xmath35 m , also for the weakest lines .",
    "we checked the equivalent widths derived from _ superspectre _ by measuring them also using standard iraf routine _ splot _ , and found a fair agreement , with maximum differences amounting to 5m . the line list ( fei , feii , mg ,",
    "si , ca , al , , na , ni and ti , see table  3 ) was taken from @xcite , who considered only lines with equivalent widths narrower than 150m , in order to avoid non@xmath3linear effects in the lte analysis of the spectral features .",

    "our stars are metal richer than this value and cooler , a fact which makes us confident about the derivation of the o abundance",

    "we then adjusted the effective temperature by minimizing the slope of the abundances obtained from fe  i lines with respect to the excitation potential in the curve of growth analysis . while in the case of saurer  1 the derived temperature yields a reddening consistent with the photometric one , in the case of berkeley  29 the spectroscopic reddening turns out to be e(b@xmath3v)= 0.08 , significantly smaller than the photometric one ( see the discussion in sect  6 ) .",

    "the measured iron abundances are [ fe / h]=-0.38@xmath16 and [ fe / h]=-0.44@xmath17 for saurer  1 and berkeley  29 , respectively . the reported errors are derived from the uncertainties on the single star abundance determination ( see table  4 ) somewhat surprisingly , we do not find extremely low metal abundances , as one would expect from the large galactocentric distances and the known abundance gradient @xcite . + as a check for the entire procedure , we derived the abundances for the star arcturus ( @xcite ) following the same recipe as for the main targets , and obtaining abundance values well consistent with the values reported by @xcite , who performed the same kind of analysis .",
    "the results have been listed in tables  4 and 5 .    finally , following the method described in @xcite , we derived the stellar spectral classification , which we provide in table  1 .",
    "our study is the first to provide spectral abundance determinations of stars in berkeley  29 and saurer  1 .",
    "here we briefly discuss the revision of the properties of these two clusters which follow from our measured chemical abundances .",
    "saurer  1 was recently studied by @xcite , who , on the basis of deep vi photometry and a comparison with stellar models , derived and age of 5 gyr , a distance of 19.2 kpc and a reddening e(v@xmath3i)=0.18 .",
    "these authors suggest that the probable metal content of the cluster is around z=0.008 . here",
    "we obtained [ fe / h]=@xmath30.38@xmath60.14 , which corresponds to z=0.007 , thus confirming the photometric estimate . by using the new metallicity , then ,",
    "the cluster properties are not modified in a significant way .",
    "we confirm both the photometric reddening and the galactocentric distance derived by @xcite .",
    "berkeley  29 was studied by @xcite , who suggested a reddening e(b@xmath3v)=0.21 and a very low metallicity of about [ fe / h]=@xmath31.0 . by assuming these values",
    ", @xcite derived a galactocentric distance of 18.7 kpc .",
    "the present study provides different results .",
    "in fact , the spectroscopic reddening turns out to be e(b@xmath3v)=0.08 , significantly lower than the kaluzny estimate , and the metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath30.44@xmath60.18 , significantly higher .",
    "these new values of reddening and metallicity yield new age and galactocentric distance estimates , 4.5 gyr and 21.6 kpc , respectively .",
    "these estimates have been obtained by comparing the cluster cmd with the exact metallicity isochrones from @xcite .",
    "therefore berkeley  29 is the most distant open cluster in the milky way currently known .",
    "in fig .  4 we plot the radial abundance gradient as derived from @xcite , which is at present the most updated version of the gradient itself .",
    "+ the clusters included in their work ( open squares ) define an overall slope of @xmath30.06@xmath60.01 dex kpc@xmath4 ( solid line ) . for the sake of the simplicity ,",
    "we assume for the moment that the two new clusters analyzed in the present work @xmath3saurer  1 and berkeley  29@xmath3 are two genuine galactic disk old ocs . they ( filled circles )",
    "clearly deviate from the general trend",
    ". however , if we take them into account , the slope of the gradient would be much flatter , i.e. @xmath30.03@xmath60.01 dex kpc@xmath4 .",
    "+ the same conclusion could be extended to the age@xmath3dependent radial abundance gradient .",
    "@xcite used 39 clusters to show that the radial abundance gradient becomes flatter with time ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) , although one has to note that different age gradients have different spatial baselines and therefore describe different zones of the disk .",
    "this result contrasts with the previous analysis by @xcite , where no trend was found with age in a sample of similar size ( 37 clusters ) , except for a slight steepening of the gradient at intermediate ages ( see their fig .",
    "7 ) . when adding the two new clusters , berkeley  29 and saurer  1 , the radial gradient in the older bin becomes almost completely flat .",
    "in addition we note that if one adds the new [ fe / h ] determinations for ngc  2506 , ic  4651 and ngc  6134 by @xcite , the gradient disappears almost completely also in the younger age bin , thus confirming the overall trend proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the trends of abundance ratios for old open clusters and concluded that all the old ocs for which abundance ratios are available show scaled solar abundance ratios , with no correlation with overall cluster [ fe / h ] or with cluster age .",
    "the only deviation from this conclusion was found in collinder  261 , a 8 gyr cluster , where si and na abundances are slightly enhanced . the same trend for these two elements",
    "is reported by @xcite for ngc  6819 , a 3 gyr open cluster with higher than solar metal abundance .",
    "apart from these two elements , however , old ocs show scaled solar abundances , in agreement with typical galactic disk field stars .",
    "+ in table  5 we list the abundance ratios for the observed stars in berkeley  29 and saurer  1 .",
    "our program clusters have ages around 5 gyrs and iron metal content [ fe / h ] @xmath18 @xmath30.4 .",
    "they are therefore easily comparable with clusters having similar properties discussed earlier in the literature , such as ngc  2243 and melotte  66 ( see @xcite , tab .  7 )",
    "it is interesting to note that while the latter two clusters have scaled solar abundances , our program clusters have generally enhanced values for all the abundance ratios .",
    "+ at a similar [ fe / h ] , berkeley  29 and ngc  2243 have different values for all the abundance ratios , with the exception of [ mg / fe ] , although the average [ @xmath19/fe ] ratio is enhanced in berkeley  29 and solar scaled in ngc  2243 .",
    "berkeley  29 also exhibits enhanced [ o / fe ] with respect to ngc  2243 .",
    "+ the same conclusions can be drawn for saurer  1 , when compared with melotte  66 , an old open cluster of similar age and [ fe / h ] .",
    "all the abundance ratios in saurer  1 appear enhanced when compared with melotte  66 , except for [ o / fe ] , which is similar in the two clusters .",
    "by looking at fig .  4 one can argue that fitting with a straight line all the data points does not have any statistical meaning .",
    "simply , the two new points ( filled circles ) deviate from the bulk of the other points . + these results seem instead to imply that the chemical properties of the outer galactic disk are different from the bulk of the disk itself .",
    "we propose here two possible explanations :    \\1 ) in a series of papers ( @xcite ) , it has been shown that a ring@xmath3like stellar structure , the monoceros stream , exists in the direction of the galactic anticenter , which could represent the debris of a disrupting dwarf galaxy in a noncircular , prograde orbit around the milky way . in particular , @xcite proposed that a number of globular and old ocs might be associated with the stream . with a radial velocity of 24.6@xmath60.1 km s@xmath4 and a galactic longitude of 19798 , berkeley 29",
    "seems to be well associated with the stream ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , its metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath30.44@xmath60.18 perfectly matches the global metal abundance of the stream ( @xmath30.4@xmath20 ) .",
    "+ we can not , however , draw the same conclusion for saurer  1 .",
    "although the metal abundance is the right one , the longitude 21431 and the radial velocity of 104.6@xmath60.1 km s@xmath4 completely rule out the possibility that this cluster is associated with the stream .",
    "one should invoke another explanation to justify the particular location of this cluster in the galactic disk radial abundance gradient .",
    "+ 2 ) some galactic chemical evolution models predict that the chemical evolution of the outer disk is dominated by the halo , and therefore it undergoes a completely different evolution from the bulk of the disk .",
    "we took the radial abundance gradient predicted by the _ c-_model of @xcite , which assumes that the milky way formed through two main collapse events , the first one generating the halo and the bulge , the second one smoothly building up the disk inside@xmath3out . in this model , a higher initial enrichment due to star formation in the halo",
    "is reached in the outer thin disk .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although halo and disk formed almost independently , the halo gas is predominating in the outermost disk regions and it creates a pre@xmath3enriched disk gas dominating the subsequently accreted primordial one .",
    "this gives origin to the rise in [ fe / h ] at large galactocentric distances ( see fig .  4 , dotted line ) . at smaller galactocentric distances",
    ", the amount of disk gas always predominates , thus diluting the enriched halo gas which falls onto it .",
    "we finally recall that the negative abundance gradient predicted for galactocentric distances smaller than 15@xmath316 kpc is due , in this framework , to the assumption of an _ inside@xmath3out _ formation of the galactic thin disk . in fig  4",
    "we show the expected behaviour of the gradient in the outskirts of the disk , and an inversion of the slope is predicted to occur at 13@xmath314 kpc from the galactic center , roughly as observed .",
    "we stress that chemical evolution models simply rely on abundances and abundance ratios , and can not take into account the kinematics of the stellar population .",
    "however , the agreement between model and observations is rather striking . further support to this scenario comes from the analysis of the expected abundance ratios in the outskirts of the disk . here",
    "the models by @xcite predict overabundances in o and @xmath19 elements similar to what we actually observe , due to the fact that the model evolution is dominated by the old stellar population of the galactic halo .",
    "it is true that our results rely on four stars in two clusters , and that more data are needed to clarify the global issue of the evolution of the outer galactic disk .",
    "however it is quite clear from the present analysis the the outer disk does not reflect the general trend seen in the inner disk , and that the outer disk is probably the outcome a series of mergers occured in the past , in the same fashion as the galactic halo .",
    "we have presented high resolution spectroscopy of four giant stars in the extremely distant old ocs saurer  1 and berkeley  29 , and provided the first estimate of their metal abundances .",
    "we have found that these two clusters do not belong to the old open cluster family of the milky way , since they significantly deviate from the global radial abundance gradient and exhibit abundance ratios typical of the galactic halo rather than the galactic disk .",
    "moreover they are located quite high onto the galactic plane , a position which better fits into the thick disk of the galaxy .",
    "+ berkeley  29 is presumably associated with the monoceros stream , whereas saurer  1 does not belong at all to the stream , and shows quite different kinematic features . without taking the kinematics into account ,",
    "the anomalous behaviour of these two clusters can be explained by assuming that the outer parts of the disk evolved in a different way with respect to the bulk of the disk itself , and that the chemical evolution driver at those distances was the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "in fact the abundance ratios , in particular [ o / fe ] and [ @xmath19/fe ] , show the typical enhancements expected in an old stellar population like the milky way halo .",
