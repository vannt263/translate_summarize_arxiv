    ", we plot the thermopower @xmath9 over temperature @xmath54 for various doping @xmath92 and compare to experiment  ( see ref .   for a corresponding comparison of the resistivity ) .",
    "the experimental results are in good agreement with our data , even though a direct comparison is made difficult , by the  ( in this case ) unknown orientation of the crystal in the experiment .",
    "the result of larger thermopower @xmath9 with increasing @xmath92 can be qualitatively explained by band structure arguments .",
    "still , there can be additional effects due to correlations and disorder .",
    "the k - integrated spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_doping1 ] indicate that spectral weight is shifted from electrons @xmath78 to holes @xmath77 as @xmath285 .",
    "this further enhances the `` pudding mold '' effect of the group velocity @xmath291 .",
    "the k - resolved spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralcontributions_doping ] show another result : the `` pudding mold '' contribution of the k - path in the xy - plane @xmath186 important for @xmath292 is joined by the @xmath293 contribution @xmath294 as the fermi level moves down .",
    "that provides an explanation why the dampening of the linear increase of the thermopower @xmath9 becomes smaller as @xmath295 .",
    "in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 two distinct effects enhance the hole current in comparison to the electron one : a larger group velocity and a larger number of holes or , more precisely , a larger hole spectral weight  @xcite , also see fig .",
    "[ fig : summary1 ] . as both effects point in the same direction",
    ", we obtain a large electron - hole imbalance .",
    "consequently , a temperature gradient results in a higher hole current , and , hence , a large positive thermopower s. the larger group velocity of the holes can be understood already from a one - particle lda point of view .",
    "it is caused by the particular pudding - mold type of bandstructure  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyzed the second mechanism which is a genuine correlation effect .",
    "the microscopic origin is a complex interplay of coulomb repulsion @xmath2 and a ( disordered ) potential @xmath296 due to the na vacancies .",
    "we have hence taken @xmath2 and @xmath296 as free parameters ( not _ ab initio _ ones as in ref .  ) .",
    "the coulomb repulsion alone ( without disorder ) has only a rather minute impact .",
    "this is due to the filling of 1.7 electrons per co site . with 0.3 holes in an otherwise filled co a@xmath120 orbital ,",
    "chances to have 2 holes on the same co site are very small .",
    "hence the impact of the coulomb repulsion , whose main effect is to suppress such configurations , is small . without the vacancy potential , electronic correlations in na@xmath0coo@xmath1",
    "would therefore be very weak . without coulomb repulsion on the other hand , the vacancy disorder smears out the spectrum and",
    "particularly enhances the resistivity less than the current  heat - current correlation function is diminished , so that the thermopower actually decreases .",
    "the story becomes very different if coulomb repulsion and disorder potential are combined .",
    "then , the disorder potential gives rise to two inequivalent lattice sites .",
    "since the number of holes in the @xmath8 exactly corresponds to the number of sites with a higher potential for the electrons , we end up with a situation close to two electrons on the co sites with adjacent na - ion and one electron on the co site with adjacent vacancy .",
    "in this situation , electronic correlations can be very strong for the half - filled co sites with an adjacent vacancy .",
    "because of this , we get a strongly renormalized spectrum with a sharp peak at the fermi level , see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum2 ] .",
    "the other sites , with adjacent na - ions , on the other hand , have only a sizeable spectral weight on the hole - side of the fermi level .",
    "taken together , we have more ( quasi-)holes but nonetheless sharp peaks in the spectrum . in this situation ,",
    "the thermopower increases up to 80 @xmath297 with interaction .",
    "for a larger value of the disorder potential , the coulomb interaction can even ( counter intuitively ) change the behavior from an insulator with a very small thermopower to a metal with a big one . + for tracing down the energy and momentum of the quasiparticles",
    "responsible for positive and negative thermopower alike , we have analyzed the various contributions to the thermopower separately . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralcontributions1 ] , we show for which @xmath71 and @xmath72 we have a significant contribution from the group velocity , the spectral weight , and for which interval holes and electrons can be thermally activated .",
    "we also introduced a thermoelectric spectral weight which combines these terms and hence provides for a @xmath71- and @xmath72-resolved analysis of the thermopower .",
    "the biggest contributions naturally stem from those @xmath71-vectors which have the largest group velocity , albeit the quantitative contribution is changing in comparison to the non - interacting case .",
    "most interestingly , also hole contributions appear which , without interaction , were not present at certain @xmath71-points .",
    "generally , electronic correlations change the energies and momenta with big contributions to the thermopower quite substantially .",
    "+ as the vacancy ( disorder ) potential @xmath296 is most crucial for the thermopower and the physical properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 in general , it is worthwhile to have a closer inspection of this parameter . actually , in lda calculations , @xmath296 is rather small , i.e. , @xmath298ev(ref .  ) .",
    "this value is way too small to provide for the aforementioned charge disproportionation and the resulting strong electronic correlations on the co sites with vacancy .",
    "marianetti and kotliar @xcite , argued that lda overestimates screening so that the actually @xmath296 is much larger , i.e. , @xmath299ev .",
    "this is also the value we have considered in our paper as the physically relevant one . besides the overestimation of screening , we think that the electron - phonon coupling is an important source for the effective increase of @xmath296 by @xmath300 ( @xmath301 : electron phonon coupling strength ; @xmath302 : phonon frequency ) .",

    "<S> heat energy is widely used in power plants to produce mechanical energy which is then further converted to electricity . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the widespread application of this multiple - step process is based on the lack of an efficient direct alternative . + </S>",

    "<S> + the development of novel thermoelectric applications follows two routes : first , there is the search for new materials with a large intrinsic @xmath6 which can either be achieved by optimizing features of already known compounds  ( via e.g. bandstructure engineering  @xcite ) or by the discovery of new classes of materials with peculiar properties  ( e.g. kondo systems  @xcite ) . </S>",
