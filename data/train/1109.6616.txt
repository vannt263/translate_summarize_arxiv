    "self - catalytic or catalyst - free growth protocols have been developed , thus avoiding use of au , a source of deep trap formation.@xcite high - mobility and ballistic transport , similarly to gaas planar structures , are therefore realistic targets in csnws in the short run .    a typical geometry , as the one investigated in this paper , is shown in fig .  [ geometry ] .",
    "gaas nws grow as hexagonal crystals along the [ 111 ] direction , exposing the six \\{110 } facets .",
    "the gaas core is overgrown by an epitaxial algaas shell , possibly including a doping layer , and by a gaas capping layer .",
    "surface states easily deplete the outer layers , and a 2deg may localize at the inner gaas / algaas hetero - interface , which consists of six planar _ facets _ several tens of nm wide , interrupted by six _ edges_. the confined electronic system has the six - fold symmetry of the nw used as a substrate .",
    "it should be noted that in a typical hetero - junction the electron gas extends into the gaas layer by tens of nm , due to the balance between kinetic and coulomb energy scales .",
    "this is comparable to typical nws diameters , and the electron gas on opposite sides of the gaas core may strongly couple.@xcite therefore , the free electron gas formation in a csnw is a genuinely two - dimensional problem ( we assume the csnw to be translationally invariant in one dimension ) .",
    "for example , it is easy to infer that for large doping / size of the structure , coulomb energy will induce charge to localize along six quasi-1d channels at the edges of the interface , to maximize the average electron - electron distance .",
    "ab - initio atomistic methods are computationally intensive and therefore limited to very thin nws ,  1 - 2 nm in diameter .",
    "nonetheless , they can provide important informations on the band - alignment and dopant properties.@xcite modelling of larger csnws is also limited .",
    "recently , the single - particle properties of a _ cylindrical _ electron gas have been simulated including strong homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields@xcite and @xmath1 effects.@xcite due to the prismatic geometry of csnws , however , cylindrical symmetry is broken , and localization at the edges of the hetero - interface may take place.@xcite therefore , in nws with diameters in the tens of nm range , the electronic system deviates substantially from the idealized cylindrical shape , and the electron gas may behave as a set of quasi-1d systems , rather than a uniform electron gas wrapped around the core .",
    "the above simulations neglect electron - electron interactions , though , and the confinement at the gaas / algaas interface is assumed , as , e.g. , in a narrow radial quantum well . as discussed above , however , in doped structure the in - plane directions can not be disentangled and full calculations need to be performed where the confinement is self - consistently included.@xcite    in this paper we discuss the formation of the electron and hole gas in gaas / algaas core - shell nws which are _",

    "we will show that remote charge density which forms at the inner gaas / algaas interface may be tuned with doping and/or external gates changing the symmetry and localization of the distribution .",
    "the electron / hole gas has a mixed dimensionality , which is locally 1d or 2d .",
    "remarkable difference , from this point of view , is found between electron and hole gases .",

    "when the coulomb contribution is small , conduction electrons distribute over the core , since vertical localization energy is large .",
    "lateral localization would be also dominant over the small coulomb energy in this regime , hence the isotropic , cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the charge gets localized near the gaas / algaas interfaces only if the density and , hence , the average coulomb energy is so large that localization at the edges is energetically favorable . in this regime , indeed , the small additional cost in lateral localization energy at the edges with respect to facets is overcompensated by gain in coulomb energy due to inter - edge repulsion . for holes , instead",
    ", the small kinetic energy ( one order of magnitude smaller than for conduction electrons ) makes it easier to localize at the accumulation layer near the interface even at very low densities .",
    "since the coulomb energy is anyway small in this regime , at the interfaces hole density may localize at the facets , rather than at the edges , where the lateral confinement energy would be larger .",
    "we finally note that the localization depends essentially on the amount of free charge , which in the present calculation is tuned by the doping density .",
    "alternatively , one could fix the doping density to a large value , and deplete the electron ( hole ) gas using an external gate grown around the wire , recovering the different localization regimes shown above using a negative ( positive ) voltage applied to it .",

    "clearly , the applied voltage induces the opposite effect than in the electronic system , increasing ( decreasing ) and localizing the charge density at the bottom ( top ) of the nw at negative ( positive ) voltages . in parallel with the result obtained at zero voltage ,",
    "the nw with higher density of @xmath0-dopants shows qualitatively the same behavior as its @xmath2-doped counterpart .",
    "thus , in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ hole_contours ] it can be seen that , again , a nw with two and four quasi-1d hole channels can be attained by tuning the applied voltage .",
    "nevertheless , the trend of the hole density to localize in the facets at low density regimes enables the observation of new voltage - induced charge arrangements when the density of dopants is lower .",
    "for instance , at @xmath74 one can see that the charge density is concentrated in the center of the three top facets of the nw , while at @xmath75 a 2d hole gas is clearly formed over the bottom facet .    to conclude , in fig .",
    "[ hole_sector_dens ] we show the effect of the gate voltage on the linear hole density integrated over the three regions of the nw .",
    "the results are equivalent to the electronic case , with the role of the three regions reversed due to the opposite sign of the carriers , and can be rationalized along the same lines .     and ( b ) @xmath72.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have determined the properties of an electron / hole gas in a realistic model of _ radial _ heterojunctions formed in a modulation doped gaas / algaas csnws , emphasizing the different localization and symmetry which can be realized as a function of the doping level and/or by a back - gate .",
    "contrary to planar heterojunctions , conduction electrons do not form a 2deg well localized at the gaas / algaas interface , but rather show transitions between different charge distributions across the section of the csnws . for conduction electrons ,",
    "these are similar to phases predicted in gan / algan csnws@xcite . for @xmath0-doped structures , the heavier effective mass result in additional phases for the hole gas which have no counterpart for conduction electrons .",
    "in particular , it is possible to form a nearly uniform six - fold bent 2d hole gas at the gaas / algaas interfaces .    in general , however ,",
    "our results show that the electron and hole gases in these structures deviate substantially from any isotropic distribution at the gaas / algaas heterointerfaces .",
    "it is particularly important that , depending on the density and possibly the applied gate potential , the charge density reshape between quasi-1d and quasi-2d distributions .",
    "this is likely to be reflected in multiple and tunable time - scales of scattering mechanisms.@xcite in most cases , therefore , we expect complex behavior in possible future transport experiments .",
