    "recently charged black hole with a scalar hair in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , where the scalar field couples to gravity and it also couples to itself with the self - interacting potential , analyzed by the xu and zhao [ 1 ] .",
    "they found appropriate conditions for the metric in which a charged extremal black hole reproduced as an asymptotically ads space - time with a naked singularity at the origin .",
    "also they shown that the size of the outer horizon increases monotonically with both the scalar hair and the electric charge . refs . [ 2 - 6 ]",
    "has similar studies on ( 2 + 1)-dimensional rotating hairy black holes .",
    "such 3d black holes are also interesting to study ads / cft and related topics [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]",
    ". however calculation of the thermodynamic quantities left as an open problem .",
    "we know that the black hole thermodynamics and statistics are interesting fields of theoretical physics .",
    "so we studied in several papers these subjects for various black holes [ 10 - 17 ] . in that case critical behaviors of thermodynamical quantities of 3d black holes with a scalar hair has been studied in the ref .",
    "[ 18 ] and concluded the presence of the cosmological constant may be considered as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as a volume .",
    "also it is found that the corresponding equation of state predicts a critical universal number depending on scalar hair parameter .",
    "+ now , in this paper we consider charged black hole with a scalar hair in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions and calculate thermodynamical and statistical quantities .",
    "indeed we investigate effects of black hole charge and scalar field on thermodynamical and statistical parameters .",
    "also we study spectroscopic aspects [ 19 - 21 ] of this black hole and obtain discrete spectrum .",
    "we find that this system has thermodynamical stability .",
    "therefore in next section we review charged hairy black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "then in section 3 we study thermodynamics and obtain entropy , temperature and heat capacity which yields to obtain thermal stability .",
    "spectroscopic aspects of this black hole studied in section 4 and statistical mechanics of this black hole investigated in section 5 .",
    "finally in section 6 we give conclusion .",
    "in this work we consider a class of black hole solution obtained by the ref . [ 1 ] .",
    "the solution represents static charged black hole with a scalar field given by the following action , @xmath0},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a coupling constant between gravity and the scalar field which will be fixed as @xmath2 [ 1 ] . +",
    "this black hole described by the following static , circularly and asymptotic metric [ 1 ] , @xmath3 where , @xmath4 @xmath5 is the electric charge , @xmath6 is integration constants and related to the cosmological constant , @xmath7 denotes the usual radial coordinate with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "also @xmath11 is integration constants depends on the black hole charge and mass , and @xmath12 related to the scalar field as , @xmath13 by imposing various constraints , the horizons radius are obtained [ 1 ] and we go ahead the black hole thermodynamics through these cases .",
    "in order to study thermodynamics of a charged hairy black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions we begin with the generic form of the entropy , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is horizon radius obtained by @xmath16 using the equation ( 3 ) . therefore , using the metric ( 2 ) in the relation ( 5 ) gives the following entropy , @xmath17 where we assumed @xmath18 . in order to obtain black hole temperature , potential and special heat capacity we used the following relations , respectively , @xmath19 @xmath20 and , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath5 are the black hole mass and charge respectively .",
    "the sign of specific heat determines thermodynamics stability of black hole .",
    "if the black holes have positive specific heat then it is in stable equilibrium [ 22 , 23 ] . + first of all we study the special case of uncharged black hole",
    "then , in order to find the effect of the black hole charge extend our work to the several cases of charged black hole .      in the case of uncharged black hole we set @xmath23 in the equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the other important parameter is @xmath11 . in the case of @xmath24",
    "we see that the black hole radius and therefore the black hole entropy vanishes . on the other hand for the case of @xmath25 the equation ( 3 ) reduced to the following , @xmath26",
    "then , the black hole horizon is given by , @xmath27 therefore the black hole entropy easily obtained by using the equation ( 6 ) .",
    "in the fig . 1 we see that the black hole entropy increased by scalar field parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this is in agreement with the result of the ref .",
    "[ 1 ] which tells that the size of the black hole must increase as @xmath12 increases .     with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "2 we can see that the scalar field parameter @xmath12 decreases the black hole mass but increases the black hole temperature .",
    "since @xmath32 , then we conclude that increasing of @xmath6 ( or decreasing of cosmological constant ) can reduces the black hole mass and temperature . finally , from the equation ( 9 ) one can obtain , @xmath33 in the fig .",
