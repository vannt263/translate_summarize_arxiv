    "the cherenkov telescope array ( cta , acharya et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) is the project of a new array of several imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) for very high - energy ( vhe ) astronomy .",
    "the array shall be composed by three different types of telescopes , in order to maximize the performance in three different energy ranges : the large size telescope ( lst ) for the low energy range ( e @xmath1 20 gev  1 tev ) , the medium size telescope ( mst ) for the core energy range ( e @xmath1 0.110 tev ) , and the small size telescope ( sst ) for the high energy range ( e @xmath2 1 tev ) . the astri project ( ` astrofisica con specchi a tecnologia replicante italiana ' ) is included in this framework : it is a ` flagship project ' of the italian ministry of education , university and research , which , under the leadership of the italian national institute of astrophysics ( inaf ) , aims to realize and test an end - to - end prototype of the sst .",
    "the astri sst-2 m prototype is characterized by two special features which will be adopted for the first time on a cherenkov telescope ( pareschi et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) : a dual - mirror schwarzschild ",
    "couder ( sc ) optical design ( vassiliev et al .",
    "2007@xcite ) , which is characterized by a wide field of view ( fov ) and a compact optical configuration , and a light and compact camera based on silicon photo - multipliers , which offer high photon detection sensitivity and fast temporal response .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) shows the telescope layout , whose mount exploits the classical altazimuthal configuration .    the proposed layout ( canestrari et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) is characterized by a wide - field aplanatic optical configuration : it is composed by a segmented primary mirror made of three different types of segments , a concave secondary mirror , and a convex focal surface .",
    "the design has been optimized in order to ensure , over the entire fov , a light concentration higher than 80 % within the angular size of the pixels .",
    "the telescope design is compact , since the primary mirror ( m1 ) and the secondary mirror ( m2 ) have a diameter of 4.3 m and 1.8 m , respectively , and the primary - to - secondary distance is 3 m. the sc optical design has an f - number f/0.5 , a plate scale of 37.5 mm/@xmath3 , a logical pixel size of approximately 0.17@xmath3 , an equivalent focal length of 2150 mm and a fov of 9.6@xmath3 in diameter ; the mean value of the active area is @xmath0 6.5 m@xmath4 .",
    "the primary mirror is composed by 18 hexagonal segments , with an aperture of 849 mm face - to - face ; the central segment is not used because it is completely obstructed by the secondary mirror . according to their distance from the optical axis ,",
    "there are three different types of segments , each having a specific surface profile . in order to perform the correction of the tilt misplacements ,",
    "each segment will be equipped with a triangular frame with two actuators and one fixed point .",
    "the secondary mirror is monolithic and has a curvature radius of 2200 mm and a diameter of 1800 mm .",
    "it will be equipped with three actuators , where the third actuator will provide the piston / focus adjustment for the entire optical system . for both the segments of the primary mirror and the secondary mirror the reflecting surface",
    "is obtained with a vapor deposition of a multilayer of pure dielectric material ( bonnoli et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) .",
    "the sc optical configuration allows us designing a compact and light camera .",
    "in fact , the camera of the astri sst-2 m prototype has a dimension of about 56 cm @xmath5 56 cm @xmath5 56 cm , including the mechanics and the interface with the telescope structure , for a total weight of @xmath0 50 kg ( catalano et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) . such small detection surface , in turn , requires a spatial segmentation of a few square millimeters to be compliant with the imaging resolving angular size .",
    "in addition , the light sensor shall offer a high photon detection sensitivity in the wavelength range between 300 and 700 nm and a fast temporal response . in order to be compliant with these requirements , we selected the hamamatsu silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) s11828 - 3344 m .",
    "the ` unit ' provided by the manufacturer is the physical aggregation of 4 @xmath5 4 pixels ( 3 mm @xmath5 3 mm each pixel ) , while the logical aggregation of 2 @xmath5 2 pixels is a ` logical pixel ' ( figure  [ fig1 ] , lower right ) ; its size of 6.2 mm @xmath5 6.2 mm corresponds to 0.17@xmath3 . in order to cover the full fov",
    ", we adopt a modular approach : we aggregate 4 @xmath5 4 units in a photon detection module ( pdm ) and , then , use 37 pdms to cover the full fov .",
    "the advantage of this design is that each pdm is physically independent of the others , allowing maintenance of small portions of the camera . to fit the curvature of the focal surface , each pdm",
    "is appropriately tilted with respect to the optical axis .",
    "the camera is also equipped with a light - tight two - petal lid ( figure  [ fig1 ] , upper right ) in order to prevent accidental sunlight exposure of its sipm detectors .    the astri sst-2 m prototype",
    "will be placed at the ` m. g. fracastoro mountain station ' , the observing site of the inaf catania astrophysical observatory ; it is at serra la nave , on the etna mountain , at an altitude of 1735 m a.s.l .",
    "( maccarone et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) .",
    "the prototype is currently under construction and it will be tested on field : it is scheduled to start data acquisition in 2014 . although the astri sst-2 m prototype will mainly be a technological demonstrator , it should be able to perform also scientific observations .",
    "based on the foreseen sensitivity ( @xmath1 0.2 crab unit at 0.8 tev ) , a source flux of 1 crab at e @xmath2 2 tev should be detectable at 5 @xmath6 confidence level in some hours , while a few tens of hours should be necessary to obtain a comparable detection at e @xmath2 10 tev ( bigongiari et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) .",
    "in this way we would obtain the first crab observations with a cherenkov telescope adopting a schwarschild  couder optical design and a sipm camera ; in addition , also the brightest agns ( mkn 421 and mkn 501 ) could be detected .",
    "beside the prototype , the astri project aims to realize , in collaboration with cta international partners , a mini - array of a few sst dual - mirror ( sst-2 m ) telescopes .",
    "thanks to the array approach , it will be possible to check the trigger algorithms and the wide fov performance , to compare the mini - array performance with the monte carlo expectations and to validate the performance predictions for the full sst array .",
    "the astri / cta mini - array shall constitute the first seed of the cta observatory at its southern site and shall perform the first cta science , starting operation in 2016 .    considering 7 telescopes at an optimized distance of 250 - 300 m",
    ", preliminary monte carlo simulations yield a minimal improvement in sensitivity compared to the current iacts ( di pierro et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) : starting from e = 10 tev , the mini - array expected sensitivity is slightly better at few tens of tev ; moreover , the astri / cta mini - array sensitivity is still competitive up to 100 tev , where the performance of the present generation of iacts drops dramatically . in this energy regime",
    "the mini - array will operate as the most sensitive iact array",
    ". the astri / cta mini - array will be able to study in great detail sources with a flux of a few 10@xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 at 10 tev , with an angular resolution of a few arcmin and an energy resolution of about 10 - 15 % .",
    "the astri / cta mini - array will observe prominent sources such as extreme blazars ( 1es 0229 + 200 ) , nearby well - known bl lac objects ( mkn 421 and mkn 501 ) and radio - galaxies , galactic pulsar wind nebulae ( crab nebula , vela - x , hess 1825 - 137 ) , supernovae remnants ( vela - junior , rx j1713.7 - 3946 , kepler ) and microquasars ( ls 5039 ) , as well as the galactic center . in this way it will be possible to investigate the electron acceleration and cooling , to study the relativistic and non relativistic shocks , to search for cosmic - ray ( cr ) pevatrons , to study the cr propagation and the impact of the extragalactic background light on the spectra of the nearby sources ( vercellone et al .",

    "we also acknowledge partial support by the miur bando prin 2009 ."
