    "osmosis is the physical phenomenon in which a concentration difference of impermeant solute molecules across a semi - permeable membrane produces a difference in solvent density , and in pressure , across the membrane .",
    "this has enormously important consequences - osmosis forms the basis of the transport of ions across cell membranes @xcite , the regulation of blood salt levels by the kidneys @xcite , uptake of water by plants @xcite , technologies for kidney dialysis @xcite and clean power production @xcite , and many other processes .",
    "osmosis also lies at the heart of many important phenomena in chemical physics including the donnan effect @xcite , the depletion interaction @xcite and , recently , mechanisms for generating self - propelled colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "the cornerstone of our understanding of osmosis is the van t hoff relation , which states that a solute concentration difference , @xmath0 , leads to an equilibrium osmotic pressure difference @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this relation predicts that the osmotic pressure difference is the same as the pressure of an ideal gas at concentration @xmath0 , regardless of the molecular nature of the solute and solvent molecules .",
    "gibbs showed that the van t hoff relation can be derived by setting the chemical potential of the solvent equal across the membrane @xcite ; the thermodynamic origin of the osmotic pressure difference is then the entropy of mixing between solute and solvent .",
    "the van t hoff relation only holds for low solute concentrations ; at higher concentrations , deviations from this `` ideal '' behaviour can be used as a diagnostic of solute - solute interactions , such as ion pairing @xcite .    from a thermodynamic point of view ,",
    "osmosis is thus well understood . however , osmotic effects are also important in non - equilibrium systems @xcite , for which a thermodynamic description is not valid . for systems that are out of equilibrium , a clear picture of the underlying molecular dynamical mechanisms",
    "is an essential prerequisite for understanding osmotic phenomena . yet",
    "such a picture is largely lacking , even though the dynamical basis of osmosis has been the subject of over 100 years of discussion , since the seminal work of van t hoff .",
    "relevant factors may include bombardment of the membrane by solute molecules , diffusion of solvent across the membrane driven by its density difference , specific types of interaction between solute and solvent molecules and pulling of solvent molecules across the membrane in the wake of solute - membrane collisions @xcite .",
    "while the overall picture remains unclear , progress has been made in understanding the dynamical basis of osmosis in specific systems . in an important contribution",
    ", brady @xcite showed that for a system of colloidal solutes suspended in a coarse - grained solvent , the osmotic pressure can be derived from a purely mechanical , hydrodynamic langevin description of colloidal motion ; here , hydrodynamic interactions between colloids , mediated by solvent , play a central role .",
    "for systems with explicit solvent particles , guell and brenner @xcite showed that the van t hoff relation can be derived from first principles by taking into account all the forces involved ; here , the role of membrane - solute interactions is emphasized .",
    "importantly , while a thermodynamical description of osmosis can not depend on the details of the system s dynamical rules ( e.g. the interparticle interactions , membrane geometry , etc . ) , the nature of the underlying dynamical mechanisms may be sensitive to these details , and could be different for different osmotic systems . indeed , detailed models of osmotic water transport through membrane pores in ionic solutions have highlighted the importance of specific solvent - membrane and solvent - ion interactions in these systems @xcite , while the unusual characteristics of osmotic water flow through carbon nanotube membranes can be described by 1d stochastic hopping models @xcite .",
    "other studies have shown that partial solute penetration into membrane pores can strongly influence solvent flow @xcite , and that , for ionic solutes , non - trivial coupling can arise between the transmembrane electric field and osmotic flow @xcite .    in this paper , we seek to provide a clear `` minimal '' picture of the dynamical mechanisms underlying osmosis , in a system which is as simple as possible . murad and powles @xcite , and itano _ et al _ @xcite , have demonstrated that osmosis can be achieved in systems in which solute and solvent particles have identical lennard - jones interactions , while luo and roux @xcite have used an external potential , invisible to the solvent , to mimic a semi - permeable membrane for ionic systems . here , we combine these elements to create a `` minimal model '' osmotic system with purely repulsive particles , and with no solvent - membrane interactions , for which we carry out a detailed study of the dynamics of solvent and solute particles in the osmotic steady state . for this system , we are able to derive a simple theoretical expression for the osmotic pressure in terms of solute - solute and solute - solvent interactions . analyzing the forces on the solvent particles in our system leads us to an intuitive model in which the solvent density and pressure gradients in osmotic equilibrium are maintained by a balance between an outward solvent flux generated by the osmotic pressure gradient and an inward diffusive flux .",
    "although more complex mechanisms may be at play in real osmotic systems , they are not required to describe the fundamental physics of osmosis in this minimal model system .",
    "this work should provide a basis on which to build future descriptions of osmotic phenomena in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems .",
    "our model system is designed to reproduce the essential physics of osmosis , while eliminating as far as possible complications due to the specific chemical nature of the solutes , solvent and the semi - permeable membrane . in our system solute and solvent particles",
    "interact with each other indistinguishably , and there are no solvent - membrane interactions . our simulation setup is illustrated in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "the simulation box is partitioned into `` solution '' and `` solvent '' compartments ; the solute particles are confined within the central solution compartment by an external potential of the form @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the perpendicular distance between a solute particle and the boundary of the compartment , and @xmath4 is the particle diameter ) . the solvent particles do not experience the confining potential and are free to move throughout the simulation box .",
    "the confining potential therefore acts like a semi - permeable membrane .",
    "both solvent and solute particles are of unit mass @xmath5 and interact via identical , repulsive , weeks , chandler , andersen ( wca ) interactions ( @xmath6 $ ] if @xmath7 and zero otherwise ) , with parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite ( i.e. our units of energy and distance are @xmath10 and @xmath4 respectively ) .",
    "the system is simulated using molecular dynamics , with the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite and timestep 0.001 ( in reduced units @xcite , ; in our simulations @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath11 are all set to unity . ] ) , combined with a nos - hoover thermostat @xcite . in total , our system contains 5000 particles ( solute plus solvent ) in a periodic , cubic simulation box of size @xmath12 , so that the total particle density @xmath13 ( the packing fraction @xmath14 ) .        in this paper , we focus on the osmotic steady state ; we therefore allow the system to equilibrate thoroughly before data is collected .",
    "we measure the local pressure in the solution and solvent compartments using the method of planes @xcite .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ app : mop ] , this constitutes a direct measurement of the kinetic and interaction components of the momentum flux across a local plane . the osmotic pressure is then computed by taking the difference between the pressures in the two compartments .",
    "we could also have measured the osmotic pressure directly from the force exerted by the solute particles on the membrane ( as done by luo and roux @xcite ) , or using virial expressions for the local pressure @xcite ; these methods give identical results . to compute the concentration of solute particles , @xmath15",
    ", we need to define the volume of the solution compartment .",
    "this is non - trivial , because the confining potential is smooth .",
    "we define the solution volume by matching the pressure - density relation for a gas of solute particles , confined in the solution compartment , in the absence of solvent , with that of a system of wca particles simulated in a periodic box ( see appendix [ app : mop ] ) .",
    "as a function of solute concentration @xmath15 ( both in units of @xmath16 ) , in the solution and solvent compartments ( circles and squares respectively ) .",
    "the dashed lines show theoretical predictions based on the carnahan - starling equation of state ( see appendix [ app : cs]).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we first verify that osmosis indeed occurs in our model system by measuring the steady - state local density profiles in the solution and solvent compartments .",

    "in contrast , the _ solvent _ density is lower in the solution than in the solvent compartment ( figure [ fig : density1]b ) .",
    "this density imbalance increases linearly with the concentration of solute , @xmath15 , as shown in figure [ fig : density2 ] .",

    "our simulation results ( circles ) are in good agreement with the van t hoff relation ( dotted line ) . at high solute concentration ( @xmath18 , corresponding to solute packing fraction greater than @xmath19 ) , the osmotic pressure exceeds that predicted by the van t hoff relation , as expected in a system with repulsive solute - solute and solute - solvent interactions .",
    "interestingly , however , the osmotic pressure in our system is significantly lower than the pressure that would be obtained for a gas of wca particles at density @xmath15 ( dashed line in figure [ fig : dp - vs - conc ] ; computed using the carnahan - starling equation of state ) . thus a nave picture in which one treats",

    "in contrast , our aim in this paper is to investigate the _ mechanical _ origins of osmosis .",
    "it is thus of interest to derive expressions for the osmotic pressure purely from mechanical principles , without recourse to thermodynamics . in appendix [ app : virial ] we present one such derivation .",
    "starting from the clausius virial relation for the solute particles , we derive a ( to our knowledge new ) approximate expression for the osmotic pressure in terms of the forces of interaction between the solute and solvent particles :    @xmath27    here , @xmath28 is the volume of the solution compartment ( defined as described above ) , @xmath29 is the position of particle @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the force exerted on particle @xmath30 by particle @xmath32 . the first term in the brackets sums over all pairs of solute particles ( avoiding double counting )",
    "while the second term sums over all solute - solvent pairs ( note that here particle @xmath30 denotes the solute and @xmath32 the solvent ; the solvent may be inside or outside the solution compartment ) .",

    "( [ eq : vhpluscorr ] ) provides an analogous expression for the osmotic pressure , for a system in which the solvent degrees of freedom are treated explicitly and on the same footing as those of the solute .",
    "our simulations allow us to investigate in detail the microscopic forces which produce the imbalance in the density of solvent particles between the solution and solvent compartments .",

    "the answer lies in the solvent density profiles .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : density1]b , the density of _ solvent _ particles is higher in the solvent compartment than in the solution .",
    "we expect this to create a diffusive flux of solvent particles into the solution , which counteracts the outward flux caused by the net outward force .",
    "considering , rather simplistically , the `` hopping '' of solvent particles between layers next to the membrane on the solvent and solution sides , we expect that an individual particle on the solution side has a high probability of leaving the solution ( i.e. to hop from the solution to the solvent compartment ) , due to the outward pushing force , while an individual particle on the solvent side has only a low probability of entering the solution ( i.e. to hop from the solvent to the solution compartment ) . however , there are more solvent particles on the solvent side and consequently more attempts to hop into the solution than out of it .",
    "thus the net fluxes of solvent particles inward and outward are equal and the solvent density imbalance is maintained .",
    "this picture has much in common with the classic colloidal sedimentation equilibrium , in which an inhomogeneous colloidal density profile is maintained by a balance of a downward flux driven by the gravitational field and an upward diffusive flux .",
    "this analogy between osmosis and sedimentation was also noted by soodak and iberall @xcite .",
    "we note that these density profiles are also consistent with the statistical mechanical relation between the density and the potential of mean force @xcite .",

    "we now define slabs of width @xmath40 ( of the order of the molecular size ) next to the boundary on the solvent and solution sides , and consider the hopping of solvent particles between these slabs .",

    "a key feature of our simple picture is that it does not predict any correlations between the configuration of the solute particles and the hops of solvent particles across the membrane - unlike some other proposed mechanisms in which solvent particles are pulled across the membrane in the wake of nearby solute particles . to look for such effects in our simulations",

    "again , the two distributions are indistinguishable , showing that solvent particles do not cross the membrane preferentially in the direction of nearby solute particles .",

    "analysis of the density and force profiles in our simulations leads us to propose a very simple picture , in which the density imbalance of solvent particles across the membrane is maintained by a balance between an outward force - driven flux ( due to the higher total density in the solution ) and an inward diffusive flux ( due to the lower solvent density in the solution ) .",
    "we show that a simple calculation , based on the mechanics of hopping of solvent molecules across the membrane , can be used to derive the same relation between the solvent density gradient and the osmotic pressure ( eq.([eq : hopping1 ] ) ) as is obtained by standard thermodynamic arguments . for low solute concentrations",

    "we do not detect any evidence of correlations between the solute particles and the solvent flux , leading us to believe that this simple `` hopping '' picture is sufficient to describe the dynamical basis of osmosis in our simulations .    in previous work , various molecular mechanisms have been implicated in osmosis , including solute - membrane collisions , diffusion of solvent across the membrane , solute - solvent interactions and correlations between solvent and solute dynamics . in simulations of realistic osmotic systems , the dynamics of solvent molecules inside pores @xcite , interactions with the pore wall @xcite , interactions between solvent and solute molecules @xcite , and correlations between solvent flux and solute dynamics @xcite have all been shown to play important roles .",
    "it is possible that different dynamical mechanisms are at play in different osmotic systems , all of these being consistent with the known , and universal , thermodynamic relations .",
    "thus , an important topic for further work will be to understand how the conclusions of our work change for more realistic scenarios : e.g. when the membrane presents a barrier also to the solvent molecules ( via explicit pores or via a smooth potential barrier ) , when the solute and solvent do not interact identically , etc .",
    "our aim in this work , however , was to focus on a minimal model system , for which we could characterize in detail the underlying molecular mechanisms .",

    "these can act as solutes : an interesting question concerns how the osmotic pressure of a suspension of active colloids differs from that of the corresponding passive suspension .",
    "moreover , active particles may themselves generate osmotic gradients , with interesting potential for motility and self - organisation .",
    "the approach described here can easily be extended to investigate the dynamics of osmotic systems in which either the solute or the solvent particles are active .    finally , we note that the minimal setup presented in this paper also provides a very general way to measure osmotic pressure in systems involving solvent and solutes , simply by partitioning a system into two compartments using an external potential permeable only to the solvent . indeed , a similar approach has already been used to fit intermolecular potentials to experimental data on osmotic pressure @xcite .",

    "this provides an alternative way to measure the osmotic pressure , with results in good agreement with various other methods for determining the local pressure @xcite .    to define the concentration of solute particles in our simulations , we need to define an effective boundary for the solution compartment . to do this , we match the pressure - density relation of a `` gas '' of solute particles , confined in the solution compartment in the absence of solvent ( shown in figure [ fig : mopdiag]b , closed circles ) , with that of a periodic box of equivalent particles ( figure [ fig : mopdiag]b , open circles )",
