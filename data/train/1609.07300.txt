    "it is widely accepted that in the algebraic approach to quantum statistical mechanics global thermal equilibrium states of quantum physical systems can be characterized by means of the so - called _ kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition _",
    "the latter condition is based on analyticity and periodicity properties of certain correlation functions and the investigation of its consequences led to deep results concerning the expected stability and passivity properties of equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "however , the description of non - equilibrium phenomena in quantum systems , and especially in quantum field theory , has not seen such far - reaching progress .",
    "this does not come as a surprise , since in view of the wide range of non - equilibrium phenomena the task of describing systems with varying thermal parameters ( temperature , pressure , entropy density , ... ) is extremely complicated even in non - relativistic , non - quantum statistical mechanics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the subtle point is the question how to define these thermal parameters precisely .",
    "some rigorous results in this direction have been obtained for steady states of non - relativistic quantum systems @xcite and in conformal field theory @xcite , as well as for local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) states in non - relativistic quantum systems @xcite and lte states in relativistic quantum field theory on flat and curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "another approach towards the description of local equilibrium states in relativistic quantum field theory in the spirit of quantum statistical mechanics and the kms condition has been recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly sketch the underlying idea . for simplicitly we consider the quantized klein - gordon field on minkowski spacetime , with field operators formally written as @xmath2 .",
    "for any ( sufficiently regular ) state @xmath3 of the system one can then define the `` relative - variable correlation function at the spacetime point @xmath4 '' informally by w_q(z):=(q - z)(q+z)_ , zr^4 , where @xmath5 denotes the expectation value with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "leaving some technicalities aside ( for the precise definition see @xcite and section 3 below ) the analyticity properties of the relative - variable correlation function of kms states give motivation to the following definition :    _ a `` sufficiently regular '' state is said to fulfill the _ local kms condition at the spacetime point @xmath6 _ if there exists a future - pointing timelike four - vector @xmath0 and a function @xmath7 which is holomorphic on the flat tube _",
    "s_q:=\\{z+ic^4:=,0<<1 } , _ such that @xmath7 has boundary values _",
    "@xmath8 _ the latter relations have to be understood in the sense of distributions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 is assumed to fulfill certain polynomial growth bounds as well as a version of the weak - clustering property @xcite . _    as it has been demonstrated in @xcite , the lkms condition ( with a proper definition of `` sufficient regularity '' ) is equivalent to the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) condition of buchholz , ojima and roos @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on the pointwise comparison of the expectation values @xmath9 of certain pointlike localized ( thermal ) observables @xmath10 with their expectation values in ( mixtures of ) global equilibrium states @xmath11 . here , ``",
    "sufficiently regular '' means that the states are assumed to fulfill a remnant of the analytic microlocal spectrum condition @xcite . using techniques from microlocal analysis of distributions @xcite ,",
    "one finds that this assumption imposes stronger analyticity properties on the correlation functions than those imposed by the lkms condition alone . in this respect",
    ", the lkms condition above may be viewed as a ( covariant ) remnant of the _ relativistic kms condition _",
    "@xcite for certain non - equilibrium states of the quantized klein - gordon field on patches of minkowski spacetime . for a slightly less technical review of the lte and lkms condition and their interrelation",
    ", we also refer to @xcite .",
    "having established such a relation a natural question arises : if a state fulfills the lkms condition at all points of a region @xmath12 , what can we say about the possible spacetime dependence of the inverse - temperature four - vector field @xmath13 ? skipping the technical details , which will be presented below , the answer to this question is the following :    _ for the massless quantized klein - gordon field either ( 1 ) @xmath14 , and the state can be extended to a kms state on all of minkowski spacetime or ( 2 ) @xmath15 with constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the state can be extended to an lkms state defined in some open ( forward or backward ) lightcone .",
    "_    _ for the massive quantized klein - gordon field @xmath0 is constant and the state can be extended to a kms state on all of minkowski spacetime . _    we first note that these results are in accordance with similar results obtained by implementing the lte condition for the quantized klein - gordon field @xcite . in particular , buchholz has shown that for lte states with varying thermal parameters the maximal region of thermaliticity is always contained in a timelike simplicial cone , i.e. an intersection of characteristic half - spaces , cf .",
    "the above result demonstrates that , as a consequence of the analytic hadamard condition , the lkms condition is more restrictive than the lte condition .",
    "namely , for lkms states with varying @xmath0 it leads to a fixed maximal lkms region , given by some open ( forward or backward ) lightcone . on the one hand ,",
    "this is not surprising in view of our additional analyticity assumption on the correlation functions . on the other hand",
    ", we do not have to make additional assumptions on the form of the initial lkms region @xmath12 , in contrast to ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2 ) where the initial region of thermaliticity is already assumed to include some lightcone .",
    "let us also compare the above result with classic results on the spacetime dependence of the ( inverse ) temperature in non - quantum relativistic thermodynamics , cf .",

    "it seems to be likely that the inconsistency of eq .   and",
    "our results for the _ massless _ klein - gordon field originate from the fact that the situation considered in @xcite refers to a classical ideal fluid which is assumed to be _ massive _",
    "( i.e. it has positive mass - energy density everywhere ) .",
    "this point of view is supported by the observation that our results for the massive klein - gordon field are not in conflict with eq .  .",
    "in fact , the statement of proposition [ prop : betaofq ] for @xmath28 is just a special case of the latter , namely @xmath29 .",
    "it seems to be worthwhile to investigate this seeming discrepancy between the macroscopic and microscopic theory in more detail in order to gain more insight into the relativistic non - equilibrium thermodynamics of massless quantum fields .",
