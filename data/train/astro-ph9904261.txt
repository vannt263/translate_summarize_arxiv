    "ever since , conditions have not been right to add further deuterium to the primordial production ; neither nuclear fusion processes nor the spallation of heavier nuclei by energetic cosmic rays can augment the original abundance ( although stellar flares were suggested by mullan & linsky [ 1999 ] to produce deuterium ) .",
    "the deuterium abundance in fact decreases continuously as deuterium is burned up in stars .",
    "the present day deuterium abundance in the interstellar medium provides a lower limit to its primordial value , and it reflects the history of stellar reprocessing of the gas ; measurements of its spatial variation may shed light on the star formation history in a given region ( e.g. , tosi 1998 , tosi et al .",

    "the main uncertainty of our value appears to arise from the indirect measure of the hd excitation , and of the abundance of atomic hydrogen in the warm shocked region .",
    "less dissociative shocks would require larger corrections for non - lte level populations , which would raise the implied hd abundance : neglecting all h  hd collisions , we earlier derived @xmath146 , which yields [ d]/[h]@xmath147 . now chemical depletion should not occur in shocks with a low abundance of neutral hydrogen , so that this values reflects the actual deuterium abundance .",
    "interestingly , we find that the effects of non - lte and of chemical depletion nearly cancel , so that the derived deuterium abundance turns out to be not very sensitive on how dissociative the shock is .",

    "the dereddened h@xmath2  level populations served to estimate the excitation conditions in the gas .",
    "while h@xmath2  was assumed to have thermalized level populations , those for hd were computed in detail by making use of the h@xmath2  excitation . due to non - lte effects at @xmath154",

    "we note that in high - velocity c - shocks , hd may be depleted relative to h@xmath2 because of an asymmetry ( due to a small binding energy difference ) in the deuterium - hydrogen exchange reaction @xmath158 . estimating that this lowers the warm hd column by about 40%",
    ", we derive a deuterium abundance in the warm shocked gas , [ d]/[h]@xmath159 .",
    "if the emitting shocks were on average less dissociative than assumed , the chemical depletion would be less pronounced .",
    "but at the same time , the lower h - hd collision rate would enhance the hd @xmath96 level population s deviation from lte , to the effect that our implied total column of hd would increase .",
    "we estimate that the two effects approximately cancel , and that [ d]/[h ] remains at @xmath160 , independent of how dissociative the shock actually is .",
    "the major uncertainties in our estimate for the deuterium abundance arise from our indirect measure of the hd excitation , and since we must therefore rely on non - lte excitation models , on the uncertainty of the preshock density and the abundance of neutral hydrogen in the shock .",
    "future ground - based near - ir observations of ro - vibrational transition lines of hd could constrain the effects of non - lte and thereby narrow the error margins of the deuterium abundance .",
    "detailed shock models of the recently resolved , multiple bow - shaped emission in the orion outflow ( schultz et al .",
    "1998 ) might also yield better estimates for the pre - shock densities and shock velocities , and thereby of the h@xmath2 dissociation and of the chemical depletion fraction of hd in such shocks .",
    "the deuterium abundance we find , @xmath161 , is lower than that derived through most di absorption measurements in the local ism , but it is consistent with that found recently by jenkins et al .",
