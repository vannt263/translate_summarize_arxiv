    ", two tunnels span a @xmath0-simplex of @xmath2 exactly when each is obtained from the other by a construction given by h. goda , m. scharlemann , and a. thompson in  @xcite . for reasons that will become apparent , we call these constructions `` giant steps . ''",
    "the connectivity of @xmath2 shows that every tunnel can be obtained from the unique tunnel @xmath3 of the trivial knot by some sequence of giant steps , a fact already proved in  @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we will use the combinatorial structure of @xmath2 to examine minimal length sequences of giant steps that start from @xmath3 and produce a given tunnel @xmath4 .",
    "our main result is an algorithm to calculate the number of distinct such sequences .",
    "in fact this number is just the number of shortest paths between two vertices of the farey graph .",
    "the algorithm is quite elementary , but we have been unable to find it in the literature .",
    "we will use it to see that for a sparse infinite set of tunnels , the minimal construction sequence is unique , but generically a tunnel will have many such sequences .",
    "the algorithm is effective and we have implemented it computationally  @xcite .    the length of a minimal sequence of giant steps producing a given tunnel is equal to the invariant called the _ depth _ of the tunnel , defined below .",
    "this invariant is used extensively in our work on bridge numbers of tunnel number @xmath0 knots in  @xcite .",
    "only a minimal amount of the theory from @xcite is needed for the present application .",
    "we review it briefly in sections  [ sec : disk_complex ] and  [ sec : binary ] .",

    "as suggested by figure  [ fig : subdivision ] , @xmath7 grows outward from any of its @xmath1-simplices in a treelike way .",

    "the tunnel is a @xmath0-handle attached to a regular neighborhood of the knot to form an unknotted genus-@xmath1 handlebody .",
    "an isotopy moving this handlebody to @xmath5 carries a cocore @xmath1-disk of that @xmath0-handle to a nonseparating disk in @xmath5 , and carries the tunnel number  @xmath0 knot to a core circle of the solid torus obtained by cutting @xmath5 along that disk .",
    "the indeterminacy in the choice of the isotopy is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath6 that preserve @xmath5 .",

    "we do not need their formal definition , which involves the cabling construction , for we can think of them in a very simple way , from the viewpoint of a traveler along the path .",

    "an `` l '' can only be followed by another `` l '' or a `` d '' , according as the corresponding binary invariant @xmath44 is @xmath39 or @xmath0 , and similarly an `` r '' is followed by another `` r '' or a `` d '' , according as @xmath44 is @xmath39 or @xmath0 . when the previous step is `` d '' , then the effect of @xmath44 depends on the step before the `` d '' . if the two previous steps were `` ld '' , then the next step is `` r '' or `` l '' according as @xmath44 is @xmath39 or @xmath0 , while if they were `` rd '' , then the next step is `` l '' or `` r '' according as @xmath44 is @xmath39 or @xmath0 . for the example of figure  [ fig : ppath ] , the step sequence is `` drrrdrdllldldrr '' .",

    "in this section we give the algorithm to calculate the number of minimal length sequences of giant steps that start from @xmath3 , the tunnel of the trivial knot , and end with a given tunnel  @xmath4 .",
