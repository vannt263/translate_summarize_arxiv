    "advances in astronomical instrumentation have simultaneously opened up new wavelength regimes while allowing deeper imaging capabilities in old ones .",
    "while this has allowed great advances to be made to our knowledge of the high redshift universe , it has greatly increased the difficulty in producing accurate cross identifications between multi - wavelength datasets .",
    "the underlying causes for this are many ; pushing to deeper flux sensitivities naturally results in a higher source density , while fundamental limitations to the angular resolution of imaging across all wavelengths means that more of these sources will become confused .",
    "this is particularly problematic when trying to make associations between deep optical / near - ir datasets and equivalently deep datasets at other wavelengths such as uv , far - ir / sub - mm or x - ray where the angular resolution is typically on the order of several to tens of arcseconds .",
    "one area in which this has been a major stumbling block is the exploitation of the first observations in the sub - mm by ground based facilities around 850@xmath0 m . because of the strong negative k - correction at such wavelengths the brightest sources at 850@xmath0 m are in fact high redshift ( @xmath1 ) starburst galaxies ( e.g. chapman et  al .",
    "2005 ) and hence will be optically quite faint .",
    "however current single dish sub - mm facilities , such as jcmt , apex or even the iram 30 m telescope , have apertures only in the 10s of metres , which results in typical 1@xmath2 positional uncertainties of @xmath3 for instruments such as scuba at 850@xmath0 m ( e.g. ivison et  al . 2005 ) . herein lies the major difficulty in identifying counterparts to sub - mm sources , the density of sources at their predicted flux density in optical and near - to - mid ir bands is very high .",
    "ideally follow - up interferometric observations in the sub - mm with facilities such as the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) , the submillimeter array ( sma ) and , in the near future , alma , could be used to reduce the positional uncertainty of sub - mm sources to match that of accompanying optical / near - ir data .",
    "however , given the small field of view and bandwidth constraints of such facilities , this is very observationally expensive and not a feasible option for the large number of sub - mm sources upcoming projects such as scuba-2 and _ herschel _ will produce .    typically the approach to finding accurate positions for sub - mm sources",
    "has been to utilise deep interferometric radio observations , utilising the strong correlation between 1.4 ghz continuum flux and sub - mm flux ( ivison et  al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; smail et  al .",
    "2000 ; ivison et  al .",
    "2002 , among many others ) .",
    "however this is also observationally expensive , the ratio between the sub - mm flux and the 1.4 ghz flux is expected to be around 100 at @xmath4 .",
    "given that the brightest sub - mm sources have a flux around 10mjy at 850@xmath0 m ,",
    "radio follow - up has to be deeper than at least @xmath5jy .",
    "even for upcoming state of the art facilities this is a difficult proposition ; e - vla it will take 10 - 20hrs / sq .",
    "deg . to survey these sorts of depths .",
    "thus it is clear that large areas of interferometric radio data of adequate depth will not be readily available for some time .    on top of this deep radio data counterparts",
    "are often not found , indeed there is some evidence that the most luminous sub - mm galaxies are also radio - dim ( younger et  al .",
    "2007 ; ivison et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "identification of counterparts in mid - ir observations from _",
    "spitzer _ has been attempted by several authors .",
    "ivison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and egami et al .",
    "( 2004 ) where amongst the first to try and utilise deep _ spitzer _ , in particular mips 24@xmath0 m , imaging to find counterparts for sub - mm sources .",
    "ivison et al . identified reliable% chance of a spurious association ] 24@xmath0 m counterparts for 8 out of 9 @xmath6mambo 1200@xmath0 m sources .",
    "egami et al . similarly found 24@xmath0 m identifications for 7 out of 10 @xmath6 scuba sources , with the remaining three lacking both radio and 24@xmath0 m counterparts .",
    "further work paints a similar picture , with 24@xmath0 m counterparts for most sources , but generally only those which are also quite strong in the radio . using deep 8@xmath0 m irac data",
    "ashby et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) were able to identify reliable counterparts for 17 scuba detected smgs in the cudss 14 hour field .",
    "of these only 5 had previous 1.4 ghz radio counterparts from relatively shallow imaging ( @xmath760@xmath0jy ) , highlighting the usefulness of shorter wavelength identifications in the absence of good radio data .",
    "ivison et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) found statistically significant 24@xmath0 m counterparts for 53 out of 120 scuba sources from the shades survey of sxdf and lockman hole , however only 11 of these were previously undetected in deep radio data .    in both the mid - ir and radio identifications the `` goodness '' of an association",
    "is determined using the @xmath8 statistic ( lilly et  al .",
    "1999 ; ivison et  al .",
    "2002 ) , which is defined as the probability that a radio or mid - ir source of a particular flux density could be found _ by chance _ at particular distance from the sub - mm source . in this way",
    "most catalogues of multi - wavelength associations to sub - mm sources are constructed by taking those with radio / mid - ir associations that have @xmath9 , i.e. they have a less than a 5% chance of being spurious .",
    "this approach is very useful for finding radio associations , as the density of @xmath0jy 1.4 ghz radio sources is still quite low compared to the typical positional uncertainty in the sub - mm .",
    "however in the mid - ir similarly faint 8 or 24 @xmath0 m sources are numerous enough that only strong or very nearby sources have sufficiently small @xmath8 statistics to be considered as confident associations .",
    "one thing that is clear is that with the advent of new wide areas surveys in the sub - mm using facilities such as blast ( pascale et  al .",
    "2008 ) , scuba-2 and _ herschel _ deep radio data will not be readily available for the significant numbers of smgs that will be detected . thus an alternative approach which is able to utilise the multi - band data at hand are needed .    here",
    "we present a new technique to narrow down the number of potential matches using the bayesian statistical framework found in budavri & szalay ( 2008 ) .",
    "importantly our technique considers both the sed and spatial information in determining which combination of multi - wavelength data is associated with a sub - mm / far - ir source .",
    "the formalism of this new technique is presented in section [ sec : technique ] .",
    "the real and simulated datasets utilized in testing this technique are described in section [ sec : data ] , with the results of these tests presented in sections [ sec : scubsims ] & [ sec : shades ] , respectively .",
    "finally section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the benefits of this technique , while section [ sec : herschel ] demonstrates its applicability to upcoming _",
    "herschel _ datasets .",
    "our association technique is broken down into a two step process .",
    "first spatial matching is performed to find potential associations between a sub - mm source and the objects in the catalogues at other wavelengths .",
    "this process is performed as per the iterative technique presented in budavri & szalay ( 2008 ; henceforth bs08 ) .",
    "the bs08 approach relies on bayesian hypothesis testing , where the hypothesis under consideration is that @xmath10 sources from @xmath10 catalogues at different wavelengths originate from the same astronomical object .",
    "this is compared to the alternative hypothesis that the @xmath10 sources come from @xmath10 different astronomical objects .",
    "the bayes factor is essentially the ratio of the posterior and prior probabilities of these two scenerios . the full mathematical basis for this technique is summarised in appendix [ app : bsmath ] .",
    "one major disadvantage of the bs08 approach is that it only considers the as an alternative hypothesis that the @xmath10 sources come from @xmath10 different physical objects , ignoring the likely scenario that some , but not all , of the sources from different catalogues are associated . in sub - mm / far - ir astronomy we are typically trying to associate one set of sources with poor positional uncertainties ( i.e. our sub - mm source catalogue ) to sets of sources with very accurate positional information ( i.e. optical or interferometric radio source catalogues ) .",
    "thus forming reliable associations between the high resolution data is relatively easy and can be accomplished with simple nearest neighbour techniques .",
    "the real challenge is establishing the link between these associations and our poorly resolved sub - mm / far - ir sources .",
    "given this we take a slightly different philosophical approach than bs08 .",
    "rather than consider that the @xmath10 sources come from @xmath10 distinct objects as an alternative hypothesis we consider the @xmath10 sources come from 2 distinct objects ; the @xmath11 high - resolution sources from one astronomical object and the sub - mm / far - ir sources from another .",
    "while this does not affect the calculation of the bayes factor for the spatial associations , it is simply the same as considering the inputs as two catalogues as opposed to @xmath10 , it has a fundamental affect on the way we calculate the bayes factor for the sed .",
    "here we calculate the bayes factor for the sed by comparing the hypothesis that an object has the measured flux ( h ) to the alternative hypothesis that it actually has a flux below the detection limit ( k ) .",
    "mathematically we calculate this via the bayes factor ; @xmath12 where @xmath10 represents the parameterisation ( t,@xmath13,@xmath14 ) of each template t , redshift @xmath13 and extinction @xmath14 considered .",
    "@xmath15 is the probability of hypothesis @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the prior probability on @xmath16 and the integrals run over the range of models , redshifts , and dust extinction .    here",
    "we assume that the likelihood of a sed being `` correct '' is given by the @xmath18 distribution via @xmath19 ^ 2}{2\\sigma_{g_i}^2}}\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the observed flux in passband @xmath21 , @xmath22 the model flux in @xmath21 given ( t,@xmath13,@xmath14 ) , b the normalisation factor and @xmath23 the error on @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath24 is the number of observed bands .    in instances where candidate matches are undetected in one or more band",
    "the flux limits are introduced as a proxy for the measured flux . if the model flux for passband @xmath21 is below the flux limit it is not considered in the sum ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "however if the model flux for passband @xmath21 is greater than the flux limit the flux limit is used , with the error assumed to be the typical error for sources near the limit .",
    "the sed fitting we perform follows a similar prescription to the photometric redshift estimation technique described in rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( 2008 ; henceforth rr08 ) , however with several key differences .",
    "the subtle difference between normal photometric redshift estimation and the technique used here is that we are performing bayesian hypothesis testing , not parameter estimation .",
    "hence the actual best fit parameters ( i.e. redshift , template , a@xmath26 ) are not the goal here , the aim is to statistically test whether or not a particular combination of sources from different catalogues is responsible for the flux detected .",
    "we utilise a subset of the templates from rr08 to fit our candidate matches . for the optical to near - ir only the 7 galaxy templates from rr08",
    "are considered ; 2 elliptical , 5 spiral types from sa to sdm . in the far - ir",
    "we consider a arp220 , m82 and cirrus template , again taken from rr08 .",
    "while more templates , and indeed combinations between templates , are typically required to produce good sed fits we find that giving the fitting process this additional freedom makes it easier to obtain `` good '' fits ( i.e. low @xmath18 ) to clearly mismatched sources .",
    "redshifts in the range 0 - 4 are considered , with a step size of 0.002 in log@xmath27 .",
    "dust extinction in the range @xmath28 is also considered , with the form of the extinction as per calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the fitting process itself is performed via the least squares fitting of two components ( optical + far - ir templates ) to the observed fluxes via the use of a non - negative least squares fitting algorithm , in this case the bounded variable least squares ( bvls ) algorithm ( stark  p.b .",
    "1995 ) ) .    as we wish to demonstrate the general applicability of the technique , a minimum level of priors is assumed .",
    "of course the selection of the sed templates is in itself a very strong prior , however as the templates used in this work have been shown by rr08 to match a large fraction of the swire galaxy population it is reasonable to believe that they represent a fair sampling of the underlying galaxy population .",
    "in addition to ensure that we are not assigning statistical significance to implausible solutions a luminosity",
    "prior is included in the same fashion as rr08 , i.e. @xmath29m@xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32m@xmath33 for @xmath1 .    in practice",
    "it is impractical to consider _ every _ combination of _ every _ source in the input catalogues .",
    "thus at each step combinations of sources which are greater than some arbitrary search radius ( typically 3 - 5 times the assumed positional error ) can be excluded from the calculations .",
    "after a list of candidate spatial matches has been compiled using the bs08 formalism sed fitting is performed on each to try and find the best match to the source .",
    "thus the algorithm for determining the final association is as follows ;    1 .",
    "calculate ln b@xmath34 and ln b@xmath35 for each association within an arbitrary radius .",
    "2 .   add together ln b@xmath34 and ln b@xmath35 to give the final bayesian evidence , ln b@xmath36 .",
    "3 .   find the largest value of ln b@xmath36 out of the potential matches .",
    "this is the final association .",
    "to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique we make use of both simulated data from galics ( hatton et  al . 2003 ) and real observations of the subaru - xmm deep field ( sxdf ) from ground and space based facilities .",
    "the galics simulations are well - suited to our purposes as they incorporate realistic clustering , realistic star formation histories and galaxy properties , and simulated seds which cover a wavelength range from uv through to sub - mm .",
    "the real data focuses on the shades scuba observations in the subaru xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) .",
    "this dataset has the advantage of having accompanying ancillary data at optical , ir and radio wavelengths allowing high precision multi - wavelength associations to be made for a large number of the scuba sources ( ivison et  al .",
    "2007 ; clements et  al .",
    "this allows us to test out optical to far - ir identifications against a `` truth '' list of radio identifications .",
    "the shades survey performed 850@xmath0 m observations with scuba on the james - clark maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) of a 0.2 sq .",
    "deg pointing coincident with the subaru xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) .",
    "details of the observations and resulting maps and catalogues can be found in coppin et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    for the shades",
    "scuba associations we utilise data from a number of deep surveys in the sxdf region . in the optical we utilise public dr1 release of the subaru xmm - newton deep field survey ( furusawa et  al .",

    "the shades field is wholly contained within the single central suprimecam pointing .",
    "observations were performed in 5 optical bands , b , v , r , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , with 3@xmath2 , 2  aperture , ab mag depths of 27.5 , 27.5 , 27 , 27 , and 26 respectively .    in the near - ir we utilise data from the ukidss ( ukirt infrared deep sky survey ; lawrence et  al .",
    "2007 ) ultra deep survey ( uds ) .",
    "ukidss uses the ukirt wide field camera ( wfcam ; casali et al , 2007 ) and a photometric system described in hewett et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "the pipeline processing and science archive are described in irwin et al ( 2008 , in prep ) and hambly et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "we utilise the dr3 release of the uds dataset , which contains photometry in j , h and k to a 5@xmath2 depth of 23.7 , 23.5 , and 23.7 ab mags respectively .",
    "the uds field is coincident with the sxdf , covering the extent of the shades scuba observations .    for the mid - far",
    "ir we utilise data from the swire survey .",
    "swire contains imaging of the entire xmm - lss field in both the irac and mips instruments on swire .",
    "this results in a 5 band dataset , with flux measurements centred on 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24.0 @xmath0 m . while the mips 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m data is included in the analysis only a very small number of shades sources are found to have nearby 70 and/or 160@xmath0 m sources in swire and thus it is of little use in the vast majority of cases .",
    "as an initial test we try to recreate in simulated data the real scenario that will be considered later in this paper the matching of 850@xmath0 m sources to deep optical and _ spitzer _ irac & mips data with no redshift information .",
    "the use of the simulations at this stage is vital as it offers the convienence of a perfect truth list to test against , i.e. we know the true underlying association for each object apriori , something which is never truly possible with real data .",
    "we select 1 cone ( cone 1 : 1 sq . deg . ) of galics simulations with photometry in 5 optical bands ( b , v , r , i,z ) , 3 near - ir bands ( j , h , k ) , the 4 _ spitzer _ irac bands , and the mips 24 & 70@xmath0 m bands .",
    "the simulated data is then broken up into three catalogues , an optical - near ir catalogue , a `` swire '' spitzer irac+mips 24@xmath0 m catalogue and a scuba 850@xmath0 m catalogue .",
    "flux limits are introduced to make these catalogues resemble those found in the sxdf .",
    "all objects with @xmath41 , s@xmath42jy and s@xmath432 mjy are kept in the catalogues .",
    "additional limits are placed on the fluxes in the `` swire '' catalogue to take into account the varying sensitivity between the irac channels and mips 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "catalogued objects with flux values less than 40@xmath0jy at irac 5.8@xmath0 m & 8.0@xmath0 m , or @xmath44jy at 24@xmath0 m are treated as undetected at these wavelength in the analysis . while these limits are somewhat lower than the real data in sxdf they better match the observed number density of objects in each catalogue .",
    "this mismatch is a result of a natural disparity between the number density of far - ir luminous sources in the galics simulations compared to the real universe .",
    "these cuts result in catalogues of 253 scuba 850@xmath0 m sources , 34932 spitzer sources ( 10817 with 24@xmath0 m ) , and 306842 optical+near - ir sources , respectively .",
    "as the flux limits for each catalogue are imposed in different wavelength regimes there is a natural disparity between the catalogues , this is reflected by the fact that not all of the sources in one catalogue have matches in the other two .",
    "specifically , only 129 of the 253 mock scuba sources have corresponding entries in the _ spitzer _ catalogue . of these",
    "117 are `` detected '' at 24 @xmath0 m ( i.e. model s@xmath45jy ) .",
    "the positions of objects in the three catalogues are independently scattered by gaussian random errors , with the positional uncertainty in each case being : optical 0.1  , spitzer 0.2  and scuba 850@xmath0 m 3  .    for our first test",
    "we try and find associations between our three catalogues requiring that a 24@xmath0 m detection is present in the _ spitzer _ catalogue ( i.e. s@xmath45jy ) . for comparison",
    "we also find the best 24@xmath0 m association for each mock scuba source using the p - statistic ( downes et  al .",
    "table [ tab : sims24um ] summarises the our results in terms of completeness ( total number of correct matches over all true associations ) and reliability ( number of correct matches over total made ) . like",
    "the p - statistic our approach relies on a single statistic to determine the believability of an association ; the bayesian evidence @xmath46 .",
    "three @xmath46 selection thresholds are presented ; none , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 selection is consistent with `` strong evidence '' for a match according to the jefferys scale jeffreys ( 1961 ) . a final selection ( @xmath48 ) which matches the number of associations found via the @xmath9 selection is also shown .",
    "this is to enable a fair and direct comparison between the two methods .",

    "+    the remaining 23 scuba sources are again left without optical - ir associations .",
    "it is likely that the bulk of these sources are simply too faint in the _ spitzer _ irac & mips 24@xmath0 m bands to be found in the swire survey .",
    "one of the distinct benefits of our association technique is that in addition to identifying the correct counterpart the best - fit photometric redshift and sed is also produced as a by - product .",

    "the other 2 all have upper limits which are higher than both predictions , i.e. they should have been detected given the depth of the radio observations . while this would appear to be a strong argument against the plausibility of these associations a large number of the i07/c08 sample of smgs are also found to have 850@xmath0m/1.4 ghz flux ratios much higher than expected .",
    "while this may simply be a result of the large errors on both the scuba 850@xmath0 m and 1.4 ghz radio fluxes and possibly erroneous photo-@xmath13 s , there are still a significant number of discrepant smgs even when errors are taken into account .",
    "6 smgs from the i07/c08 sample are found to have discrepantly high 850@xmath0m/1.4 ghz flux ratios here . of these one",
    "is the incorrect association sxdf850.10 .",
    "another three are cases where we have found a photometric redshift much less than c08 ( sxdf850.8 , sxdf850.11 , sxdf850.37 ) . in these cases the flux ratio would not be discrepant if the smg is actually at the c08 photo - z estimate rather than the one made here .",
    "this leaves two cases ( sxdf850.96 , sxdf850.119 ) in which the 850@xmath0m/1.4 ghz flux ratio is inexplicably discrepant .",

    "so while we hesitate to further downgrade the status of these associations , this exercise again demonstrates the diagnostic power of the radio data to discriminate between plausible associations . additionally this also demonstrates the need for good quality redshifts , whether they be spectroscopic or , more practically , well calibrated photometric estimates .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that deep interferometric radio images remain the most effective way to identify counterparts to sub - mm galaxies . of the 25 ids we are able to present with some certainty , only 5 are without radio counterparts .    when considering the practicality of using mid - ir data to identify distant sub - mm sources it is worth noting the expected ratio between the sub - mm flux and those in the irac and mips 24@xmath0 m bands is significantly greater than the sub - mm to radio flux ratio",
    "this is emphasised in figure [ fig : a220flxrat ] . shown",
    "are various expected flux ratios for an arp220 template in the _ spitzer _ irac and mips bands , and also a prediction of the 1.4 ghz radio from carilli & yun ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is clear that for a typical scuba 850@xmath0 m source with s@xmath58mjy , and an arp220 like sed , at @xmath59 we would expect to detect it in the mid - ir at 24@xmath0 m at @xmath60jy and at 8@xmath0 m at @xmath61jy , while in the near - ir the 3.6@xmath0jy flux would again be @xmath62jy .",
    "these values are approximately an order of magnitude fainter than the nominal detection limits of the swire survey .",
    "clearly not all smgs are so weak in the mid - ir , as the samples identified here are clearly identifiable in the swire data .",
    "irac and mips surveys in fields such as goods and uds do approach these depths and so we expect these datasets to be invaluable in providing counterparts for future scuba-2 and _ herschel _ sources in these fields .",

    "another major complication in trying to identify optical to mid - ir counterparts for sub - mm galaxies is our dependance on the template sed s to describe accurately the relationship between the flux in the different bands . in the radio",
    "this is much simplified as the far - ir  radio correlation is known to hold to high redshifts ( chapman et  al .",
    "2005 ; kovcs et  al . 2006 ; ibar et  al .",
    "while here we have used a simple set of templates which are known to crudely satisfy a wide range of galaxy types ( rr08 ) , it is clear that deriving a set of sed s which properly map the properties of the sources under investigation will provide better demarcation between correct and incorrect associations .",
    "however rather than this being a failure of the techinique it could actually be its most powerful benefit as it allows for a greater flexibility in the inclusion of prior information about the galaxy population than simple techniques such as the @xmath8-statistic .",
    "this will be discussed further in the following section .",
    "it is clear from the work presented above that this approach is useful for situations where spatial associations are not sufficient , but reasonable priors can be assumed about the properties of the object s seds .",
    "in addition , as this is an automated technique which provides a single statistic ( the bayes factor ) as a measure of the `` goodness '' of an association it is also very useful in situations where the number of sources requiring associations is larger than can be visually inspected .",
    "a large number of current and upcoming missions are within the bounds of these criteria , including ; the blast experiment , scuba-2 legacy survey , and _ herschel _ extra - galactic legacy surveys ( pilbratt et  al .",
    "2001 ) , among many others .    as shown in section [ sec : scubsims ] a major failing of the @xmath8-statistic , and similar , techniques is that they have difficulty dealing with cases where the surface density of real counterparts is very high .",
    "this is often the case for sub - mm sources as they tend to be at high redshift and hence the short wavelength counterparts are expected to be faint , and therefore numerous . there is no way to easily modify those techniques to deal with this failing , as they are built around the notion that true association are those which could not occur by chance .",
    "this is not a difficulty for our approach as we do not take into account the surface density of sources , but instead use our prior knowledge about sed shapes .",
    "however , the effectiveness of our technique is highly dependent on the implementation of these priors , as can be seen in the results of section [ sec : scubsims ] & [ sec : shades ] . as we wished to simply test the association algorithm the templates and priors used in the analysis are nave .",
    "encouragingly even with these nave priors we are able to achieve similar levels of completeness and reliability as the @xmath8-statistic in both simulated and real data .",
    "the real power of the technique is that it can tailored to specific applications by including priors that are more specific to the population of galaxies under consideration .",
    "one major failing of our naive set of templates is that they are not an orthogonal basis set , hence introducing a bias towards some sed shapes . for future applications",
    "a `` gold standard '' set of associations ( i.e. a representative sample of associations which are known to be correct ) could be used to produce a basis set of templates via principal component analysis ( pca ) or similar techniques . alternatively ,",
    "if a large `` gold standard '' set can be defined , the technique could be modified to do away with templates altogether and simply use the `` gold standard '' set as the model distribution to test against , in a similar way to photometric redshift technique presented by wolf et al .",
    "in addition , all other prior information about the galaxy population in question can be included in a natural way , e.g. predicted luminosity and redshift distributions .",
    "it is clear that our before our approach can be used the priors on the sed must be carefully determined , tested , and optimised on mock or well known real datasets .",
    "this extra level of complexity means that existing techniques such as the @xmath8-statistic or other simple approaches not discussed here , such as the likelihood ratio ( sutherland & saunders 1992 ) , may be preferred for applications where the surface density of counterparts is low , and the flux distributions similar ( i.e. the brightest sources match to the brightest counterparts in other catalogues ) .",
    "however in more difficult cases such as those present here our technique has the potential to be make reliable associations that could not be made with a simpler approach .",
    "one of the most exciting applications for our proposed technique could be finding short wavelength associations for sources detected by the instruments aboard herschel .",
    "in particular the spire instrument griffin et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) will be able to image at 250@xmath0 m , 350@xmath0 m and 500@xmath0 m .",
    "however given that the primary mirror size of herschel is 3.5 m these observations will be plagued by the same issues of poor positional uncertainty as existing sub - mm facilities .",
    "in addition the blast experiment performed observations in the spire bands utilising a smaller balloon - borne 2 m primary .",
    "thus it is of interest to see how well our technique could band merge these datasets with shorter wavelength , in particular mips 24@xmath0 m , data .    for this exercise",
    "we construct set of mock catalogues from the galics simulations which represent single band spire catalogues .",
    "in addition we create a mock `` deep '' mips 24@xmath0 m catalogue with which we want to associate our spire sources . in this scenario",
    "we only consider spire bands not only as these will be the most affected by positional errors , but this should also give some indications on how effective this approach would be on existing data from blast .",
    "the spire catalogues are flux limited at s@xmath63mjy , s@xmath64mjy , s@xmath65mjy .",
    "while these fluxes are relatively arbitrary they were chosen to match the expected source density at 250@xmath0 m ( @xmath66 per sq .",
    "deg . ) quoted by large herschel survey programs such as hermes ( oliver et al . in prep ) .",
    "the 350@xmath0 m and 500@xmath0 m limits are subsequently chosen to be equivalent limits for the exposure time needed to reach the 250@xmath0 m depth .",
    "for the mips 24@xmath0 m catalogue we select all objects with s@xmath67jy .",
    "these criteria result in 4 single band catalogues with 14578 24@xmath0 m , 3631 250@xmath0 m , 1187 350@xmath0 m and 500 500@xmath0 m sources respectively .",
    "positions for sources in each single band catalogue are scattered via gaussian random noise with a @xmath2 equal to the expected positional uncertainty ; 1.5  for mips 24@xmath0 m , 3.5  for spire 250@xmath0 m , 4.7  for spire 350@xmath0 m and 7  for spire 500@xmath0 m .    while in the previous discussion",
    "the alternative hypothesis for the calculation of b@xmath35 was more obvious i.e. that the observed object has an sed inconsistent with the sub - mm emission , here that hypothesis is not so applicable as it is not practical to fit an sed template to the 24@xmath0 m data alone . given this , and the surprising success of the p - statistic in our previous tests , it seems natural to combine the two approaches and use the p - statistic as the alternative hypothesis .",
    "this shift is somewhat natural as the p - statistic is defined as the probability of finding a source of a given flux in a given search radius by random chance .",
    "thus on face value it is actually the statistic we are looking for to give the probability that an association is simply a random superposition .",
    "this introduction of the p - statistic is mildly complicated as it is designed to give the probability of finding a single source of a given flux within a given search radius , not a collection of multiple sources . to overcome",
    "this we calculate the total probability of finding our collection of sources by chance by first calculating the p - statistic for each band , given the distance from the best - estimate position , the measured flux and a search radius defined as @xmath68 the expected positional uncertainty .",
    "then the probabilities for each band are multiplied together to give the total probability that the association is a random superposition .",
    "we process these catalogues using our bayesian association technique with exactly the same approach as before , except that now the alternative hypothesis in the calculation of b@xmath35 is the total p - statistic for the match , rather than a sed fit .",
    "the caveat that each association contains a 24@xmath0 m source is introduced for practical reasons .    processing these catalogues with the bayesian association technique results in 3612 matches of which 3424 are 100% correct .",
    "this translates to a completeness & reliability of 95% . of the 3612 associations made 2477",
    "are made on the basis of 250@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m data alone , while 1091 include a 350@xmath0 m source , and 408 include a 500@xmath0 m source .",
    "thus while the completeness levels for the 250@xmath0 m sources are very high , they drop to 91% for the 350@xmath0 m sources , and 80% for the 500@xmath0 m sources .",
    "the reliability also suffers with 94% of 350@xmath0 m associations made correctly , and only 87% of 500@xmath0 m associations made correctly .",
    "interestingly while the error rate in the 500@xmath0 m associations is disturbingly high the difference in the resulting 500@xmath0 m flux quoted for the mismatch is usually very close to the value found in the correct association . in 71% of 500@xmath0 m",
    "mismatches the flux of the interloping source is within 10% of the correct source , and only 5 ( 9% ) of interlopers have a flux which is more than 20% off the true value .",
    "this is a nightmare scenario for our approach as these mismatches can not be distinguished from the correct solution via either the sed ( which would be almost the same ) , nor the p - statistic .",
    "however in practical terms these mismatches would be unlikely to have any discernable affect on the band merged catalogue nor scientific use of it , the 500@xmath0 m sources have the worst positional uncertainty and hence contribute almost no information to the best estimate position , while the real flux uncertainty of spire 500@xmath0 m sources would be expected to be in the 510% range .",
    "thus while the associations of 500@xmath0 m sources appears to have an unacceptably low reliability this may prove to have little consequence in terms of the scientific usage of catalogues produced in this way .",
    "we have presented a new technique for finding associations between astronomical sources with large positional uncertainties . at the heart of our approach",
    "is a bayesian framework for the association problem which extends that presented by budavri & szalay ( 2008 ) .",
    "applications of the technique have been shown on both simulated and real sub - mm datasets from galics and scuba , respectively . for simulations of existing ground - based sub - mm",
    "datasets the performance of our method is found to be comparable with the p - statistic , with the key difference being that our method is superior at recovering reliable associations for the highest redshift sources .    using a sample of scuba sources in sxdf from coppin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with good radio identifications from ivison et al ( 2007 ) as a testbed we recover 22 of 33 ( 67% ) radio identifications using only the optical to mid - ir data .",
    "using a bayes factor threshold it is possible to construct a catalogue with reasonable completeness ( 20/33:64% ) but very high reliability ( 95% ) , successfully demonstrating the power of combining sed information and spatial information in a bayesian way .",
    "our technique finds plausible mid - ir associations for 4 previously unassociated shades scuba sources in the subaru - xmm deep field .",
    "finally an application of the technique on future herschel spire data is presented .",
    "we conclude that using our approach to band merge sources from the 3 spire bands and _ spitzer _ mips 24@xmath0 m would result in merged catalogues with a completeness and reliability of @xmath69% .",
