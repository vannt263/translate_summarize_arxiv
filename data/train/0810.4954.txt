    "@xcite for recent reviews , @xcite for textbook expositions ) .",
    "the effective chiral framework can also be extended to the one - baryon sector , where a fully relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) has been formulated , describing baryon interactions at low energies ( recent reviews are given in @xcite .",
    "the equivalent heavy - baryon approach is reviewed , _",
    "e.g. , _ in @xcite ) . as in virtually all areas of hadronic physics @xcite , in the low - energy regime",
    "spin phenomena are of great interest as probes of the structure and dynamics of baryons .",
    "chiral effective theories are essential tools in the study of those phenomena and have been applied , for instance , to compute nucleon spin structure functions and spin - dependent polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "from the experimental point of view , spin observables at low- and medium - energies have bee the subject of intensive studies in some cases , but data is scarce in others . there exists , for instance , a substantial body of data on analyzing powers in nucleon ",
    "pion scattering at energies around the @xmath0 resonance peak ( see @xcite and refs .  therein ) , and at lower energies @xcite . in the strange sector data on spin observables at low energies are definitely rare , though some exist  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a particular aspect of hadron spin dynamics , the production of polarized baryons in unpolarized meson  baryon scattering , in bchpt .",
    "such polarization effects are known to be large in the high energy regime @xcite where , unlike at low energy , the degrees of freedom relevant to the dynamics are the partonic ones . here , we compute the spin asymmetry and polarization of the final - state baryon in its rest frame in low - energy two - body meson  baryon scattering with unpolarized initial state , to lowest non - trivial order in bchpt .",
    "our main result is the expression for the spin asymmetry to that order in closed analytical form . from a more qualitative point of view ,",
    "our main motivation is to ascertain what spin asymmetries and polarizations are obtained in bchpt , what physical mechanisms are responsible for them , how they depend on the kinematics of the scattering process ( energy , scattering angle , and flavor ) , and what is the order of magnitude of the polarization effects obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we present our notation and conventions , including our choice of flavor basis , the parameterization for the scattering amplitude and the related expressions for the spin asymmetry and polarization , and the tree - level amplitudes .",

    "this result completes the calculation of the asymmetry and polarization at lowest non - trivial order in bchpt . in sect.[sec : discu ] we discuss our results in a more concrete setting , illustrating them with numerical computations of the polarization for several meson ",

    "the sign of @xmath73 in the @xmath237 channel is opposite to that of the other channels , and the maximum of @xmath242 over the range @xmath243 shows a much weaker dependence on energy in that channel than in the others .",
    "in this paper we computed the spin asymmetry and the polarization for the final - state baryon in unpolarized two - body meson  baryon scattering in lowest non - trivial order bchpt .",

    "[ sec : discu ] , where several meson ",
    "proton processes are considered .",

    "by contrast , for the reasons analyzed above , polarizations for @xmath246 are smaller . in the @xmath228 meson  baryon sector the leading - order approximation used here can not be expected to be valid .",
    "in fact , it is known that due to the strong coupling and subthreshold resonances ( @xmath247(1405 ) ) in this sector , non - perturbative coupled - channels analysis are required to reproduce available cross - section data .",
    "the polarization curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] are only meant to illustrate the leading - order results obtained here for the polarization .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : discu ] , a source of uncertainty in the leading - order result is the value of @xmath93 . that uncertainty is inherent in the leading - order approximation , since it is higher - order corrections that shift @xmath93 from its chiral - limit value and split it into its physical values . on the other hand , the chiral - limit @xmath93 is subject to considerable uncertainty itself in the three - flavor case .",
    "the effects of a variation in @xmath93 on our results are readily quantifiable , however , since we expect the polarization to scale approximately as @xmath196 ( and exactly so at leading order ) .",
    "we remark that the numerical value for @xmath93 used in sect .",

    "[ fig : fig2][fig : fig5 ] .",
    "finally , we hope that the results obtained here may prompt a re - analysis of the wealth of data obtained in many experiments with meson beams ( @xmath248 beams at lampf , triumf and psi , for instance ) in the past decades , leading to experimental information on the observables discussed here .",
