    "the formation mechanism for supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei remains unknown .",
    "variations on most of the formation channels identified by @xcite  which include instabilities in clusters of stars or stellar remnants , and the collapse of supermassive stars or massive discs  are still under consideration today @xcite .",
    "a more recent idea holds that supermassive black holes result from sustained accretion onto , or mergers of , the remnants of population  iii ( i.e. metal - free ) stars @xcite , at least some of which seem likely to be massive , short - lived progenitors of stellar mass black holes @xcite .",
    "no current observation directly constrains the different classes of model for black hole formation . however , there are clues .",
    "the existence of massive black holes in quasars at redshifts @xmath6 strongly suggests that these black holes , at least , started forming at redshifts high enough ( @xmath7 ) to predate extensive metal enrichment by the first stars .",
    "motivated by this , we develop in this paper a model proposed by @xcite ( bvr ) , in which supermassive black holes form , not from pop  iii stars themselves , but rather from the evolution of a new class of pop  iii objects that might form in metal - free haloes too massive to yield individual stars . in outline ,",
    "the bvr model envisages a three - stage process for black hole formation",
    ". first , gas in metal - free haloes with a virial temperature above @xmath8 flows toward the center of the potential as a result of gravitational instabilities , forming a massive , pressure - supported central object .",
    "nuclear reactions may start , but the very high infall rate continues to compress and heat the core , precluding formation of an ordinary star .",
    "eventually , when the core temperature attains @xmath9 , neutrino losses result in a catastrophic collapse of the core to a black hole .",
    "we dub the resulting structure  comprising an initially low mass black hole embedded within a massive , radiation - pressure supported envelope  a _ quasistar_. initially , the black hole is much less massive than the envelope . over time",
    ", the black hole grows at the expense of the envelope , until finally the growing luminosity succeeds in unbinding the envelope and the seed black hole is unveiled .",
    "the key feature of this scenario is that while the black hole is embedded within the envelope , its growth is limited by the eddington limit for the _ whole quasistar _ , rather than that appropriate for the black hole mass itself .",
    "very rapid growth can then occur at early times , when the envelope mass greatly exceeds the black hole mass .",
    "the structure of quasistars , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_cartoon ] , resembles that of more familiar objects .",
    "the outer regions have qualitative similarities to thorne - ytkow ( 1977 ) objects , although in our case the luminosity derives entirely from black hole accretion .",
    "the accretion physics is related to the ",
    "hypercritical \" regime of accretion @xcite , which may be observed in x - ray binaries such as ss433 @xcite .",
    "however , these are very rough analogues .",
    "the large difference between pop  iii opacity and that of present - day , metal - enriched gas , together with the dominant role of radiation pressure and the presence of ongoing accretion in quasistars , result in a unique quasistar structure .    in this paper , we study the structure and evolution of quasistars . using pop  iii opacities , we construct simplified analytic models which we compare with numerical integrations of the stellar structure equations .",
    "our model quasistars are assumed to be spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "real quasistars , if they exist , may not obey these strictures , and thus our results can not be definitive .",
    "rather , our calculations are intended to provide a first estimate of the maximum black hole mass that this mechanism can yield , together with a determination of the photospheric temperature and luminosity of quasistars that can be used to assess their detectability with next - generation observatories such as the _ james webb space telescope_.",
    "we consider a black hole of mass @xmath10 embedded within an envelope of mass @xmath11 .",
    "the luminosity of the quasistar is generated exclusively by black hole accretion , whose rate depends upon the central conditions in the envelope . to proceed analytically",
    ", we first develop simple scaling relations for the envelope structure and black hole accretion rate .      quasistar envelopes with masses @xmath12",
    "are supported primarily by radiation pressure .",
    "since the luminosity carried by the envelope must equal the eddington limit for the total mass , the flux carried by radiative diffusion in the envelope s interior is only a fraction @xmath13 of the total , where @xmath14 is the mass enclosed within @xmath15 .",
    "thus , quasistar envelopes are strongly convective , and their structures resemble @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) polytropes .",
    "the most accurate approach would be to model the envelope as a `` loaded polytrope '' @xcite , with the black hole treated as a central point mass , but for @xmath11 the standard lane - emden solutions suffice .",
    "defining @xmath18 , the ratio of gas to radiation pressure is uniform throughout the convective zone .",
    "we find @xmath19 where we have assumed a mean mass per particle @xmath20 , valid for fully ionized regions .",
    "the central regions of @xmath16 polytropes have approximately uniform densities ( @xmath21 ) , temperatures ( @xmath22 ) , and pressures ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for black hole accretion are therefore similar to those of bondi ( 1952 ) accretion , or more specifically the generalization for optical thick flows given by @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic accretion rate is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "bondi s solution assumes that all gravitational binding energy liberated during accretion is advected into the hole , but this is unrealistic in the presence of even a small amount of rotation .",
    "provided that the specific angular momentum at the bondi radius @xmath26 exceeds the specific angular momentum @xmath27 of the marginally stable circular orbit , we expect the flow to be rotationally supported . in this case",
    "a geometrically thick accretion disk will form around the hole , within which angular momentum transport is required in order for accretion to occur .",
    "although the efficiency of such a disk ( and how the energy output is partitioned between radiation and mechanical work ) is hard to calculate , it is reasonable to assume that it will depend primarily on the depth of the black hole potential .",
    "we write the luminosity as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the efficiency of energy output _ is _ expected to vary by factors of the order of unity with the black hole spin . in our models , however , we are envisaging a black hole that grows in mass by several orders of magnitude .",
    "if the accretion flow retains a similar character during this growth , we expect that the spin of the hole will rapidly attain a limiting value , after which further changes will be small . ] and @xmath30 is the actual accretion rate . for simplicity , we take @xmath31 to be a constant . in the absence of an efficient exhaust such as a jet or evacuated funnel , this energy must be carried beyond the bondi radius convectively , by the accreting gas itself .",
    "given that the convective flux density may not exceed @xmath32 , we conclude that the accretion rate will be reduced below the bondi value by a factor of order @xmath33 ( gruzinov 1998 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) . unless @xmath34  for example in the case where @xmath35  accretion is suppressed by a large factor , of the order of @xmath36 for the models we consider . combining these results",
    "we adopt the expression @xmath37 for the accretion luminosity .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 accounts for energy sinks within the bondi radius : inefficient convection , presence of outflows , etc .",
    "; as well as any inefficiency of angular momentum transport .",
    "small values of @xmath39 imply a reduced energy supply to the quasistar .",
    "the standard result for an @xmath16 polytrope ( e.g. hoyle & fowler 1963 ) , @xmath40 where @xmath41 k , coupled with the equation of state for radiation in lte , allows us to express @xmath42 in terms of the central temperature : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that the convective zone encompasses nearly the entire mass and radius of the envelope , allowing us to treat @xmath45 and @xmath46 as constant within the radiative layer .",
    "we will check the validity of this assumption in   2.4.2 .",
    "we expect @xmath42 to be very close to the eddington limit at the transition between the convective zone and the outer layer where radiative diffusion carries all the flux , and set @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the opacity at the transition radius . as we will see below , @xmath48 is close to the electron scattering opacity , @xmath49 @xmath50 g@xmath51 , hence @xmath52 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the eddington factor at the transition . equating the two expressions for @xmath42",
    ", we obtain @xmath55 we are interested in systems with @xmath56 , so @xmath22 typically lies in the range @xmath57 k and electron scattering opacity dominates in the quasistar interior . at these temperatures , the rates of energetically significant thermonuclear reactions",
    "are negligible , and can be safely ignored .",
    "we note that this differs from the case of envelope accretion onto neutron stars , where the presence of a hard surface results in high temperatures and potentially significant nuclear reactions within the hydrostatic region of the flow .",
    "although we do not model the non - hydrostatic region of quasistars in any detail , in our case high temperatures _ are _ attained in the immediate vicinity of the black hole .",
    "however , even in this region the neglect of nuclear reactions is justified , first because black hole accretion is energetically much more efficient than fusion , and second because ongoing accretion limits the timescale over which inflowing gas is exposed to high @xmath58",
    ".    the polytropic relations also allow us to estimate the radius of the quasistar ,",
    "@xmath59 @xcite and therefore its photospheric ( effective ) temperature , @xmath60 inserting our estimate for @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath61 and @xmath62 thus , quasistars should have radii of order @xmath63 au and temperatures of a few thousand degrees .      in the outer layers of the quasistar , convection is unable to transport the total luminosity and radiative diffusion takes over as the dominant energy transport mechanism .",
    "to estimate the transition temperature between the convective and radiative zones , we note that the maximum flux that can be transported convectively is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the local ( isothermal ) sound speed and @xmath66 is an efficiency factor . equating this to the photospheric flux @xmath67 ( again assuming a narrow radiative zone ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath68 this result is equivalent to the condition that radiation be trapped in the convective cells as they rise . since @xmath66 and @xmath69 , we deduce that @xmath70 . expressing @xmath71 and @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 ( using the polytropic relations and the equation of state ) , we obtain @xmath74",
    "since we will later show that @xmath3 can not drop below a few thousand degrees , we conclude that @xmath73 is well above @xmath36 k. the import of this is that at the densities and temperatures likely to apply near the transition ( for @xmath75 ) , bound - free opacity can be important but will not elevate the rosseland mean opacity above thomson scattering by a large factor .    in order to determine the structure of the radiative layer , we need to know the behavior of the opacity . for the purpose of our analytic estimates",
    ", we adopt a simple phenomenological form for the opacity , based on the pop iii opacity tables of mayer & duschl ( 2005 , hereafter md05 ) .",
    "we note that , for temperatures below @xmath36 k and densities @xmath76 g @xmath77 , the rosseland mean opacity depends much more sensitively on temperature than on density .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .  4 of md05 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath78 this expression does not capture the possible contribution of bound - free opacity above @xmath36  k , but it does mimic the extremely steep decline in opacity toward lower temperatures .",
    "a crude fit gives @xmath79 , @xmath80 k , and @xmath81 .",
    "the advantage of using an opacity that is solely a function of temperature is that one can combine the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium with the radiation diffusion equation and integrate to obtain the total ( radiation + gas ) pressure as a function of temperature ( see , e.g. , cox 1968 , chapter 20 , or any stellar structure textbook for a discussion of this technique ) .",

    "if this condition is violated we expect the outer layers to be blown off by radiation pressure , ultimately dispersing the quasistar . for our approximate opacity , which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath58 , this translates to @xmath101 .",
    "since the convective envelope is dominated by radiation pressure , we can write this condition as @xmath102 noting that the second term on the right - hand side of this equation is negligible , we substitute for @xmath73 using equation  ( [ tm2 ] ) to obtain a lower limit on @xmath3 , @xmath103 for @xmath94 , this lower limit is very insensitive to the convective efficiency @xmath104 and the envelope mass @xmath45 , and is roughly proportional to @xmath105 . for example , adopting @xmath106 and normalizing @xmath104 , @xmath107 and @xmath105 to @xmath108 , @xmath36 , and @xmath109 k , respectively , we have @xmath110 the corresponding lower limit on @xmath73 shows similar behavior : @xmath111    the first of these lower limits is the most important result of the analytic part of this paper .",
    "it represents a floor to the photospheric temperature of quasistars , analogous to the  hayashi track \" ( hayahi & hoshi 1961 ; hayashi 1961 ) , which limits the temperatures of red giants and convective protostars .",
    "our analysis differs from hayashi s model in that our convective envelopes are radiation pressure - dominated and therefore resemble @xmath16 polytropes , rather than the @xmath112 polytropes appropriate to gas pressure - dominated convection .",
    "the analytic model described above assumes that the growth of the black hole within the envelope can be described by a sequence of hydrostatic solutions .",
    "this quasi - static approximation is justified by the ordering of timescales . adopting representative values of the mass , radius , and radiative efficiency ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) the timescale on which hydrostatic equilibrium is established",
    ", @xmath117 is much shorter than the timescale on which the black hole grows @xmath118 similarly the timescale for attaining radiative equilibrium , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the optical depth through the radiative layer of width @xmath121 , is enormously shorter than any of the evolutionary timescales of the system .",
    "in addition to the quasistatic assumption , we have taken the geometric thickness and mass of the radiative layer to be negligible compared to @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "how good are these assumptions ?",
    "first , consider the mass of the radiative layer .",
    "if the layer is geometrically thin and the gravity @xmath122 is approximately constant across it , then we have @xmath123 from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium . using equations ( [ rstar2 ] ) , ( [ eq : t_m_bh ] ) , and ( [ tm2 ] ) to eliminate @xmath46 , @xmath73 , and @xmath124 in favor of @xmath3 ,",
    "we obtain ( for @xmath125 ) @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "equation ( [ deltam2 ] ) indicates that the assumption of constant mass in the radiative zone is only marginally self - consistent when @xmath3 is close to its minimum value .",
    "the approximation improves at larger @xmath3 .",
    "the geometric thickness of the radiative layer is dominated by the region close to the transition temperature .",
    "the opacity is therefore close to @xmath128 and we may approximate @xmath129 evidently , assuming geometrical thinness in the radiative layer is an even poorer approximation than assuming constant enclosed mass .",
    "in fact , our numerical models show that even the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dr_rad ] )  obtained assuming @xmath130  is not valid .",
    "the radiative layer thickness generally decreases with @xmath3 .",
    "the interior conditions of quasistars are hot enough that the opacity is dominated by electron scattering , yet too cool for nuclear reactions to occur .",
    "accordingly , we do not expect any of the stellar instabilities that depend upon complex opacities or nuclear reaction rates to afflict the interior of quasistars ( we note later the possibility of an instability near the surface due to the presence of locally super - eddington zones ) . a more serious concern  given that quasistars are highly radiation pressure dominated  is dynamically instability . in a non - rotating model ,",
    "relativistic effects raise the critical @xmath131 , below which instability occurs , to @xmath132 where @xmath133 ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "this must be compared to the actual @xmath131 in the radiation dominated interior of the quasistar . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the first adiabatic exponent is given by @xmath135 if the pressure - weighted integral over the star of @xmath136 , instability is possible .",
    "the region of the quasistar interior to the bondi radius is not in hydrostatic equilibrium , so it is meaningless to apply the above condition there . for an estimate",
    ", we evaluate the above expressions at the bondi radius using the expressions for the interior structure of the quasistar .",
    "we find that the change in the stability boundary is @xmath137 while the actual @xmath131 exceeds @xmath138 by an amount , @xmath139 we conclude that instability is possible if @xmath107 is large enough . for @xmath140 and @xmath141 ,",
    "for example , instability is possible for @xmath142 .",
    "we caution that this analysis is far too simple to describe the actual situation .",
    "globally , a robust expectation is that quasistars will be rapidly rotating as a consequence of their formation from rotationally supported gas ( bvr ) .",
    "unfortunately , this does not help us in estimating the rotation rate at the bondi radius , as the latter depends upon the very uncertain role of convection in redistributing angular momentum .",
    "however , any significant rotation would help stabilize the structure against dynamical instability .",
    "although our analytic models ought to yield a reasonably accurate picture of the generic features of quasistar envelopes , they are only marginally self - consistent for photospheric temperatures approaching the floor value . moreover , real pop  iii opacities , which are functions of density as well as of temperature , have considerably more structure than the analytic fit employed in the analytic models , and require a numerical treatment .",
    "we model quasistars as static , spherically symmetric objects in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is @xmath143 where the mass enclosed within radius @xmath15 is given by @xmath144 at the bondi radius , which for our numerical integrations we define as @xmath145 we set @xmath146 .",
    "the gas mass within the bondi radius is negligibly small compared to the black hole mass , so ignoring the non - hydrostatic region in our structure calculations should be an excellent approximation .",
    "the equation of state is a mix of gas and radiation pressure , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath149 the mean molecular weight .",
    "we set @xmath150 , appropriate for a fully ionized gas , and ignore the variation of @xmath149 due to partial ionization near the quasistar photosphere .",
    "this is a very good approximation , since the neutral hydrogen fraction generally does not exceed a few per cent .",
    "the temperature gradient is determined by the relative amount of energy carried by convection @xmath151 and radiation @xmath152 at each radius . since quasistars are powered solely by black hole accretion ,",
    "the luminosity @xmath153 is constant with radius . to determine the boundary of the convective zone",

    "we then set the _ actual _ temperature gradient to be , @xmath161}{(1+x^{10 } ) } , \\label{eq : dtdr}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 .",
    "typically , we find that the pressure scale height ( which in a mixing length theory for convection is comparable to the distance convective elements travel ) is a small fraction of the radius across the outer @xmath16390% of the quasistar by radius . in the inner regions , where the pressure profile is quite flat , @xmath164 is very small , and hence it is reasonable to assume that convection ( even if it behaves differently from a mixing length theory ) also succeeds in establishing the adiabatic gradient there . as in the analytic models ,",
    "we note that the maximum flux that convection can transport is limited by the condition that convective motions can not be supersonic .",
    "accordingly , we set @xmath165 with the efficiency parameter @xmath166 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dtdr ] ) describes the limiting behaviors of the temperature gradient in the different regions of a quasistar .",
    "the adiabatic gradient applies if the region is dynamically unstable and the flux is less than the maximum convective flux ; otherwise , the radiative gradient applies .",
    "these limiting cases accurately model the regions of high convective efficiency , in the denser and more opaque interior layers , and of high radiative efficiency , in the generally stable outer layer . in the transition region , however , our use of a flux limiter ( the @xmath167 term in eq .",

    "this peak first becomes super - eddington for @xmath180  k , and steadily grows and expands as the photospheric temperature drops until the entire radiative zone is super - eddington at @xmath194  k. note also that for @xmath195  k a narrow super - eddington region exists around @xmath196  k. this is also true for higher photospheric temperatures .",
    "we comment on this point at the end of this section .    fig .",
    "[ fig : kappat ] clearly shows the steep drop in opacity at the photosphere , and how it becomes more vertiginous as the quasistar cools down to @xmath174 .",
    "this feature ensures ( as for the `` toy '' opacity ) the presence of a minimum temperature , below which no hydrostatic solutions can be found ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tmin_vs_mbh ] ) .",
    "as @xmath3 decreases , the boundary condition at the photosphere ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : p_ph ] ] ) implies that the photospheric pressure passes through a minimum and then begins to increase . the photospheric radius _ and _ the transition radius @xmath197 then stop increasing and start sinking rapidly inward in order to maintain hydrostatic balance .",
    "eventually no hydrostatic solution is possible .    despite the complicated behavior of the opacity , the analytic power - law scalings between quasistar mass , photospheric temperature , and black hole mass ( eq .  [ [ eq : t_m_bh ] ] )",
    "remain reliable at sufficiently high temperatures , although they suffer an offset in normalization correlated with the radial thickness of the radiative layer . to illustrate this , fig .",
    "[ fig : m_vs_tph ] shows the numerically computed @xmath107 vs @xmath3 for models with m@xmath198 .",
    "the analytic scaling , @xmath199 holds well down to @xmath200  k , though there is an offset in the normalization .",
    "this offset is due to the presence of the radiative layer .",
    "a fully convective model at these high photospheric temperatures would lie on the analytic track : an example of such a model calculated for t@xmath201 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : m_vs_tph ] as a star . for higher @xmath124 ,",
    "the offset is reduced as the radiative layer gets thinner . at lower temperatures",
    ", @xmath107 deviates slowly from the power - law until @xmath174 is approached , whereupon @xmath107 drops more steeply .",
    "this is the catastrophic shrinking of the quasistar prior to evaporation . in this regime",
    "the analytic scalings do not hold .",
    "although the _ integrated _ properties of the numerical pop  iii opacity models resemble those derived analytically and numerically using the toy opacity , the presence of locally super - eddington fluxes for photospheric temperatures @xmath202 has substantial implications for the derived structures .",
    "[ fig : tr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rhor ] show the radial profiles of temperature and density for the models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappat ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lradleddt ] . in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the combination of equations  ( [ eq : hye ] ) and ( [ eq : eqstate ] ) yields an expression for the density gradient , @xmath203 in regions where the radiative force @xmath204 substantially exceeds the gravitational force the density gradient becomes positive and a local density inversion forms . at the same time , the temperature gradient steepens . in turn , the increase in the density and the decrease of temperature enhance the contribution from bound - free hydrogen absorption , raising the opacity further above @xmath205 .",
    "this general behavior becomes more marked as the photospheric temperature drops , and the radiative layer becomes denser and cooler .",
    "the existence of density inversions in our models immediately raises the question of whether such structures are stable .",
    "there are two conceptually distinct concerns . in _",
    "one dimension _ , the hydrostatic configurations we have computed are self - consistent , provided that the super - eddington regions lie beneath the photosphere . an inward - directed force due to",
    "the gas pressure gradient compensates for the imbalance between radiation pressure and gravity .",
    "however , there could exist a second solution in which the super - eddington flux drives a wind from the quasistar .",
    "if such solutions exist , the hydrostatic solution could be unstable even in one dimension , leading to mass loss at temperatures well above @xmath174 . in _ two dimensions _ , it is even more doubtful that a density inversion would be stable .",
    "the resulting instabilities could lead to lateral density contrasts and non - magnetized photon bubbles of the type analyzed by @xcite .",
    "we have not had notable success in analytically estimating the mass loss rate that might occur due to locally super - eddington fluxes in the quasistar , and our numerical scheme is not suited to tackle the problem .",
    "this failure is hardly surprising , since the problem of what happens when a star develops a limited super - eddington zone has been studied extensively in the context of luminous blue variables such as @xmath206  carina ( for a review , see humphreys & davidson 1994 ) , apparently without any definitive theoretical resolution being attained .",
    "one possibility is that a large - scale circulation pattern develops , superficially resembling convection , and the star suffers no mass loss at all @xcite .",
    "another possibility , empirically favored for lbvs , is that episodic mass loss occurs .    for what follows ,",
    "we conjecture that since the super - eddington zones in our models arise due to high densities ( and vanish if the density is reduced ) , quasistars with pop  iii opacities may develop outer regions in which there is circulation but little or no mass loss . as the width of the super - eddington region becomes comparable to the radiative layer thickness , however , the extended acceleration zone is likely to permit a strong wind to develop .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath174 as an estimate for the minimum temperature a quasistar can sustain before evaporating . that there are uncertainties in this identification should be very obvious .",
    "the properties of a quasistar will change as the black hole grows and , possibly , as the quasistar itself accretes matter from its environment .",
    "the thermal timescale in a quasistar interior is sufficiently short that the structure can adjust quasistatically .",
    "therefore , we can model the co - evolution of the black hole and envelope as a series of equilibrium models , as long as the photospheric temperature exceeds the floor associated with the opacity crisis , @xmath202 .",
    "we will consider two models for the quasistar s interaction with its environment .",
    "in the first , we will assume that the quasistar accretes matter at a constant rate , which we parameterize as @xmath207 yr@xmath51 .",
    "this growth rate is consistent with the bvr scenario for black hole growth in pregalactic halos . in the second",
    ", we will assume that the quasistar has a fixed mass , which we parameterize in units of @xmath208 .",
    "we normalize time in years and assume , again motivated by the bvr arguments , that the initial seed black hole mass is much smaller than the final mass attained prior to dissolution of the quasistar .      as long as @xmath202 , the growth rate of the black hole",
    "is set by the eddington limit of the quasistar , implying @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the accretion efficiency and we have taken @xmath211 .",
    "the accretion efficiency relates the luminous output due to accretion with the rate of growth of the black hole mass .",
    "this efficiency factor is distinct from the bondi efficiency factor @xmath39 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbh ] ) , and could be smaller than the standard value of 0.1 if energy is lost mechanically in a jet that does not couple to the envelope .",
    "when the quasistar grows at a steady rate , we have @xmath212 and the black hole mass grows according to @xmath213 if the quasistar has a fixed mass , then the black hole grows linearly with time : @xmath214 equations ( [ eq : t_m_bh ] ) and ( [ eq : mbh1 ] ) imply that the photospheric temperature decreases as the black hole grows .",
    "the quasistar thus evolves toward the opacity crisis , reaching it when @xmath215 k. for the case of steady quasistar growth , this occurs when the quasistar mass reaches @xmath216 and the black hole mass reaches @xmath217 for a fixed envelope mass , the opacity crisis is reached when @xmath218      to test the above results , we numerically computed explicit evolutionary sequences by solving the equations , @xmath219 with @xmath220 calculated from the model with no assumption as to the luminosity relative to the eddington limit .",
    "the analytic evolution tracks for quasistars depend only on the assumption that the luminosity of the quasistar is close to the eddington limit appropriate to the total mass .",
    "our numerical results verified that this is a very good approximation .",
    "accordingly , to estimate the maximum mass a black hole can grow to within a quasistar it suffices to use the analytic growth track given by equation  ( [ eq : mbh1 ] ) . the analytic estimate of the minimum temperature is less accurate .",
    "we therefore combine the analytic growth track with the numerically computed minimum photospheric temperature to derive the final mass .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms_vs_mbh ] , we plot analytic tracks corresponding to envelope accretion rates of 0.1  @xmath221 and 1  @xmath221 .",
    "as the black hole grows , the tracks move toward the right - hand side of the plot , eventually crossing into the forbidden region set by the minimum photospheric temperature .",
    "the figure shows that the final black hole mass is higher for higher accretion rates onto the envelope , because the effective temperature decreases more slowly , delaying the final dissolution at @xmath174 .",
    "we find that quasistars are indeed an efficient channel for `` growing '' intermediate mass black holes .",
    "for @xmath222 and @xmath223 , the final black hole mass is predicted to be at least a few thousand solar masses .      the parameter @xmath39 , which accounts for inefficiencies in the accretion flow within the bondi radius , is largely unknown .",
    "the numerical results we have calculated are mostly for @xmath222 .",
    "analytically , there is a simple scaling with @xmath39 , valid for @xmath224 . in this limit , the only dependence of the quasistar structure on the black hole mass enters via eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbh ] ) for the luminosity , @xmath225 .",
    "any solution in which the combination @xmath226 is constant should then have the same @xmath107 and @xmath3 , along with the same radial structure well outside the bondi radius .",
    "if @xmath39 were to be smaller than our assumed value of 0.1 , this would allow larger black holes to grow within the same envelopes .",
    "numerically , the expectation that the results depend only on @xmath227 is borne out for @xmath228 , irrespective of the photospheric temperature . for @xmath229 , it is valid only for photospheric temperatures well in excess of the minimum temperature . for low black hole masses and photospheric temperatures approaching the minimum value ,",
    "the black hole mass can not be ignored in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , and the resulting structure depends separately on @xmath124 and @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms_vs_mbh ] we plot numerical results for the minimum photospheric temperature computed with @xmath222 and @xmath230 . as is evident from the figure , the offset between these curves is not constant .",
    "however , for the higher masses that are of interest when determining the maximum black hole mass that can be attained , the @xmath231 scaling is quite accurate .",
    "our analysis of the junction between the radiative layer and convective zone indicates that no static solutions exist for @xmath232 .",
    "in contrast to a red giant , protostar , or thorne - ytkow object , where feedback allows the energy source or envelope to adjust so that the photosphere follows the hayashi track , no stable feedback appears to exist here .",
    "once a quasistar reaches @xmath174 , the plummeting opacity causes the convective zone to release radiation at a super - eddington rate .",
    "the deflation of the convective zone increases the rate of accretion onto the black hole , leading to a runaway .",
    "the only ways to avoid the destruction of the quasistar would be to decrease the mass of the black hole or to increase the mass of the envelope at an unrealistically high rate .",
    "a detailed analysis of the mass loss process is beyond the scope of this paper , but it is easy to show that the black hole is unlikely to grow much while the quasistar is evaporating .",
    "once mass loss starts in earnest , the wind will carry away nearly all the energy released by the black hole .",
    "assuming that the wind speed is of order the escape speed from the quasistar , @xmath233 , this implies that the quasistar evaporates when the energy liberated by accretion equals the binding energy .",
    "( although the quasistar is mainly radiation pressure - dominated , we assume that the binding energy is enhanced by rotation . ) the mass accumulated by the black hole during the dissolution phase is then @xmath234 which is negligibly small compared to @xmath235 .",
    "therefore , we may regard @xmath235 as the maximum mass attainable by a black hole growing inside a quasistar envelope .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the structure and evolution of quasistars , rapidly accreting black holes embedded within massive gas envelopes .",
    "we find that , for any black hole mass , there is a minimum photospheric temperature below which rapid dissolution of the envelope is inevitable .",
    "both analytic and numerical models , computed using pop  iii opacities , suggest that this minimum temperature is around 4000 - 5000  k. if quasistars are implicated in the formation of seeds for supermassive black holes in pre - galactic haloes , as suggested by @xcite , this floor temperature implies that the most luminous quasistars would emit most strongly in the rest - frame near - ir . at typical redshifts of @xmath236 ,",
    "the observed spectrum would peak at @xmath237 .",
    "we defer discussion of the possible cosmological density of such sources , and hence their observability with future facilities such as the _ james webb space telescope _ , to a subsequent paper .",
    "we have also studied the evolution of quasistars in simple scenarios for the mass growth of their envelopes .",
    "generically , as the black hole mass grows the photospheric temperature falls , until eventually the limit imposed by the behavior of the pop  iii opacity is reached .",
    "unveiling of the black hole appears inevitable long before it succeeds in accreting much of the envelope .",
    "both analytic and numerical estimates suggest that seed black holes with masses between a few @xmath4 and @xmath5 are plausible outcomes of this scenario . the efficiency of the black hole accretion process that powers quasistars ( parameterized here by @xmath39 ) is unknown",
    " if the efficiency is low ( due , for example , to polar outflows that couple poorly to the envelope ) then larger seed black holes are possible .",
    "although our numerical integrations of quasistar structure confirm many aspects of the analytic model , they also reveal complex behavior in the radiative zone immediately beneath the photosphere .",
    "narrow regions in which the flux is locally super - eddington develop for temperatures significantly in excess of the minimum temperature at which the entire radiative zone becomes super - eddington . in our hydrostatic models , these zones are characterized by density inversions .",
    "interpreting this structure is tricky , since such density inversions may well be subject to one- or two - dimensional instabilities whose ultimate resolution is unknown .",
    "hydrodynamic studies will be needed to determine the extent of mass loss that may occur at temperatures above the theoretical floor value .    finally , we note that here we have focused on black holes embedded within truly primordial gas at high redshift",
    ". _ small _ amounts of metal pollution would act to increase the opacity in the radiative zone , altering the minimum temperature and possibly increasing the likelihood of mass loss due to the formation of dust .",
    "changes to the interior structure would be smaller .",
    "in particular , the density at the base of the radiative zone is so low ( @xmath238 ) that electron scattering will continue to dominate the opacity for @xmath239 , even in the presence of pollution . of greater concern",
    "is the fact that metal enriched gas in the halo _ outside _ the quasistar would be more susceptible to fragmentation and star formation",
    ". too much star formation would reduce the rate of mass accretion onto the quasistar below the values ( @xmath240 or higher ) that we have assumed , resulting in smaller final black hole masses .",
    "it is also possible that generically similar structures could form at lower redshift whenever small black holes encounter very high rates of gas inflow .",
    "structures similar to those we have described could allow stellar remnants at the center of merging galaxies to grow significantly via a transient quasistar stage .",
