    "this communication aims to target already existing systems which could enable the use of cloaking concepts in order to achieve control of three - dimensional processes using coated spheres consisting of concentric layers of homogeneous isotropic diffusivity .",
    "various applications already implicate the use of concentric bilayered vesicles , one example being liposomes used for drug delivery @xcite .",
    "liposomes are concentric bilayered vesicles in which an aqueous volume containing a water - soluble drug is enclosed by a membranous lipid bilayer composed of natural or synthetic phospholipids . one popular type of liposomes , known as the stealth liposomes @xcite are highly stable , long - circulating liposomes whereby polyethylene glycol ( peg ) has been utilized as the polymeric steric stabilizer @xcite .",
    "stealth and other liposomes use the concept of ` invisibility ' in order to hide and evade the immunosystem by coupling water - soluble polymers to the lipid heads .",
    "therefore the polymer part of the molecule is dissolved in the aqueous environment , thus masking the liposomes from immune cells in the blood @xcite .",
    "other alternative applications to liposomes are nanoparticles based on solid lipids ( sln ) .",
    "these are composed of solid lipids stabilized with an emulsifying layer in an aqueous dispersion .",
    "this has benefits such as drug mobility .",
    "the release of the drug - enriched core of sln is based upon fick s first law of diffusion @xcite .",
    "another similar idea to the one presented in this paper is the concept of optical transparency resulting from the use of preparative reagents for the subcellular localization of fluorescently labelled tissues and organisms @xcite .",
    "high resolution imaging techniques such as laser scanning microscopy ( lsm ) are able to provide high - resolution images of biological samples .",
    "however the resolution of imaging whole organisms such as embryos by fluorescently labelling certain components , becomes somewhat distorted due to the biological samples containing optically opaque regions .",
    "these opaque components are able to transmit , reflect , scatter as well as absorb light , which can lead to image distortions . therefore certain commercially or non - commercially available reagents are available which are known as optical clearing reagents @xcite and can render tissues and organisms transparent .    here",
    "we suggest a novel application to the fast - growing research area of cloaking , whereby a better control of light can be achieved through transformational optics , following the pioneering theoretical works of pendry et al .",
    "@xcite and leonhardt @xcite , to diffusion processes in biophysics .",
    "the aforementioned paper @xcite demonstrates the possibility of designing a cloak that renders any object inside it invisible to electromagnetic radiation ( using the covariant structure of maxwell s equations ) , while the latter @xcite concentrates on the ray optics limit ( using conformal mappings in the complex plane for schr \" odinger s equation ) . in both cases ,",
    "the cloak consists of a meta - material whose physical properties ( permittivity and permeability ) are spatially varying and matrix valued .",
    "this route to invisibility is reminiscent of the work of greenleaf et al . in the context of electrical impedance tomography @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the isomorphism between the anisotropic conductivity and thermostatic equations makes it possible to control the pathway of heat flux in a stationary setting , as observed by fan et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for analogous cloaking in electrostatics ) and experimentally validated by narayano and sato @xcite",
    ". however , time plays an essential role in diffusion processes , and manipulation of heat flux through anisotropic diffusivity requires greater care in a transient regime @xcite .",
    "interestingly , anisotropic diffusion is a well - known technique in computer vision @xcite aiming to reduce image noise without removing significant parts of the image content , typically edges , lines or other details that may be important in the interpretation of the image @xcite .",
    "spatio - temporal differential equations of a reaction - diffusion type also appear in organogenesis models for the developments of limbs , lungs , kidneys and bones @xcite .",
    "the mathematical model described in this report is based upon fick s laws of diffusion , derived by adolf fick in the year 1855 @xcite , which describes diffusion processes governing various contexts ( conduction of electricity , heat , concentration of chemical species etc , and even gray scale image in computer vision ) . here",
    ", the diffusion coefficient is spatially varying ( heterogeneous ) and matrix valued ( anisotropic ) .",
    "we show numerically that control can be achieved of three - dimensional processes ( with a focus here on bio - engineering applications ) , using coated spheres consisting of concentric layers of homogeneous isotropic diffusivity , which mimick certain anisotropic heterogeneous diffusivity .",
    "previous studies have only shown the control of diffusion processes with two - dimensional transformational thermodynamics @xcite . using a similar strategy , we extend earlier works to three - dimensional diffusion processes and",
    "also discuss the issue of convection .",
    "the time - dependent convection diffusion equation was implemented in the commercial finite element software comsol multiphysics .",
    "two - dimensional computations such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) were performed using a laptop with 3 gb of ram memory , but only required 1 gb of ram memory to achieve a complete convergence of the numerical solution to the parabolic problem ( the complete convergence was checked by refining the mesh size and the time steps , in the limit of the 3 gb of available ram memory ) . for instance , the mesh for the fully converged numerical simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) consisted of 16637 mesh points and 33142 triangular elements .",
    "this computation took less than two minutes using second order lagrange equations and a time - dependent direct linear system solver ( spooles ) with a symmetric matrix condition .",
    "time step was @xmath0 throughout the time interval @xmath1 $ ] with a relative tolerance @xmath2 . however , three - dimensional computations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig3 ] were more computationally demanding than in the two - dimensional case .",
    "they were performed on a cluster of 16 computers with a total of 1 tb ram memory .",
    "nevertheless , fully converged numerical solutions required only 36 gb of ram memory to properly run ( convergence of the results was double - checked refining the mesh and time steps , what required up to 524 gb of ram memory and 48 hours of computation ) . for the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig3 ] , the mesh consisted of 152805 mesh points and 905294 tetrahedral elements for the 3d computations , and computations took approximately 12 hours ( using up to 36 gb of ram memory ) .",
    "more specifically , we used second order lagrange elements and a congugate gradients time dependent linear system solver with an algebraic multigrid ( quality of multigrid hierarchy of 3 ) and time step of @xmath0 throughout the time interval @xmath1 $ ] , with a relative tolerance of @xmath2 .",
    "recent work used a change of coordinates in the time - dependent heat equation @xcite to achieve a marked enhancement in the control of heat fluxes in two - dimensional media described by an anisotropic heterogeneous conductivity @xcite .",
    "however , it has been known since the work of fick @xcite that there is a deep analogy between diffusion and conduction of heat or electricity : because of fick s work , diffusion can be described according to the same mathematical formalism as fourier s law for heat conduction , or ohm s law for electricity .",
    "we would like to use similar analogies between diffusion of heat and concentration of chemical species to propose an original strategy towards cloaking in bio - engineering / chemical engineering .",
    "a possible application is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , through the creation of different layers .",
    "this concept has already been used to a certain extent in multivesicular liposomes which consist of bilayers of phosholipids . using the diffusivity values published for a certain lipid - conjugated drug ( @xmath3m.@xmath4 for dehydrated popc ) and coating these nanosized particles ( 30 nanometers ) with different layers of sucrose ( diffusivity of @xmath5m.@xmath4 ) and also thin layers containing substances of higher diffusivities , results in the initial particle becoming invisible in the chemical environment ( diffusivity value of @xmath6m.@xmath4 ) , which is used to represent an environment such as blood whose main constituent plasma is essentially composed of water @xcite .",
    "this can be seen with the comparison of the distribution of concentration without the cloak , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a , c ) , and with the cloak , fig .",
    "[ fig1](b , d ) .",
    "the consequences of the additional layers are more prominent at longer time points compared to shorter time points , @xmath7s ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , panels ( c , d ) ) compared to @xmath8s ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , panels ( a , b ) ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the different layers aids in maintaining high concentrations of a substance in the center of the liposome for longer periods of time .",
    "this could have advantages in increasing drug stability for longer circulation times .",
    "potential fabrication of this alternative liposome would involve additional procedures to the classical liposome fabrication steps currently used .",
    "more specifically , chloroform or chloroform - methanol or mixing with the lipid and hydrophobic organic solvents could still be used for the formation of vesicles .",
    "the appropriate removal of solvents involving rotary evaporation for extended time periods could still be used .",
    "this could be followed by frozen storage before consequent steps . secondly , replacing the classical hydration step by using an aqueous medium but with a higher concentration of sucrose compared to traditional sucrose concentrations ( with mixtures of glycine or alanine , which share the same diffusion coefficients and are also traditionally used for coating drugs ) , would allow the creation of sucrose layers during the formation of micelles .",
    "choosing appropriately sized vesicles would involve sonication techniques and analysis using techniques employed for vesicular structures such as dynamic light scattering ( dls ) equipment and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "layers containing the gaseous phase or an appropriate replacement of a high diffusivity value ( in the range of @xmath9 to @xmath10m.@xmath4 ) would be the most complicated steps in the fabrication process .",
    "in practice , it would be more feasible to replace the gaseous layers used in the numerical stimulations by media of similar diffusivity values , due to difficulties in initial fabrication and stability or maintenance of these layers .",
    "it should be noted that the examples of specific substances chosen for the simulations can easily be replaced by alternative appropriate substances with the same diffusion coefficient values .",
    "in addition , if potential cloaking applications are non - objectionable to the use of chloroform , it should be noted that this replacement has already been calculated to be a good substitute for the sucrose layers ( layer one , three and five ) .",
    "this is shown in supplementary fig . 1 , wherein there is improved cloaking as the isovalue curves for concentration outside the multilayered structure are nearly perfectly aligned ( panels ( b),(d ) ) in contradistinction to what can be observed in panels ( a ) , ( c ) for a nanoparticle not surrounded by a cloak .",
    "supplementary fig .",
    "2 shows that the maximum concentration within the nanoparticle is always lower when it is surrounded by the cloak ( and that its variation is dramatically reduced because of the cloak ) .",
    "this is demonstrated by calculating the concentration at all points along a line passing through the center of the nanoparticle without ( supplementary fig.2 , panels ( a),(c ) ) and with ( supplementary fig .",
    "2 , panels ( b),(d ) ) a surrounding cloak . note that this is achieved with simply 5 concentric layers , 3 of which have same diffusivity .",
    "a similar type of profile for concentration can be observed in supplementary fig .",
    "4 , for a three - dimensional cloak with 20 layers described in supplementary fig .",
    "we consider the convection - diffusion equation which is a parabolic partial differential equation combining the diffusion equation and the advection equation .",
    "this equation describes physical phenomena where particles or energy ( or other physical quantities ) are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes : diffusion , which results in mixing and transport of chemical species without requiring bulk motion ( it is a random walk of particles / molecules towards certain equilibrium state i.e. homogeneous distribution of chemical species inside a region ) , and convection , whereby collective movements of ensembles of molecules take place ( usually in fluid ) which in essence use bulk motion to move particles from one place to another place @xcite . in its simplest form",
    "( when the diffusion coefficient and the convection velocity are constant and there are no sources or sinks ) , the convection - diffusion equation in a domain @xmath11 ( with a chemical source outside ) can be expressed as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the mass concentration ( in biochemistry ) evolving with time @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the chemical diffusion in units of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the velocity field .",
    "we note that fick s equation is written in a general form , where @xmath18 is a variable in an n - dimensional space .",
    "accordingly , sums stretch from @xmath19 ( here applications are sought in 2d and 3d spaces , so @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is customary to put matrix @xmath22 in front of the spatial derivatives when the medium is homogeneous .",
    "however , here we consider a heterogeneous ( possibly anisotropic ) medium , hence the spatial derivatives of @xmath22 might suffer some discontinuity ( mathematically , partial derivatives are taken in distributional sense @xcite , hence transmission conditions ensuring continuity of the heat flux @xmath23 are encompassed in ( [ heat1 ] ) ) .",
    "physically , the diffusion flux @xmath24 measures the amount of substance that will flow through a small volume during a short time interval ( @xmath25 ) .    upon a change of variable @xmath26 described by a jacobian matrix @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , ( [ heat1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transformed diffusivity and velocity , respectively .",
    "let us now consider the following transform @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "this function is smooth except at point @xmath34 .",
    "it blows up the point @xmath35 to the hypersphere of radius @xmath36 , while mapping the hypersphere of radius @xmath37 to itself .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 at the boundary @xmath39 .    defining the jacobian matrix @xmath27 as @xmath40 , we find : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 identity matrix and @xmath44 .",
    "this jacobian is well defined everywhere except at @xmath45 .",
    "we note that @xmath27 is symmetric , @xmath46 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a @xmath49 dimensional eigenspace with eigenvalue @xmath50 in a space of dimension @xmath51 .",
    "the determinant of the jacobian follows easily : @xmath52    there are two cases of practical importance : @xmath20 , for which writing @xmath53 , one can see that the eigenvalues of the matrix of transformed diffusivity @xmath54 behave like @xmath55 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 ; @xmath58 for which writing @xmath59 , one can see that the matrix of transformed diffusivity @xmath54 has one eigenvalue which behaves like @xmath60 and two like @xmath61 as @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath62 , one eigenvalue of @xmath54 behaves like @xmath63 and the remaining @xmath49 behave like @xmath64 .",
    "this shows that only the case @xmath20 leads to a singular matrix of diffusivity @xmath54 at the inner boundary of the cloak ( the circumferential eigenvalue becomes infinite ) , a fact already noticed in the context of cloaking for electric impedance tomography @xcite .",
    "however , this matrix is always degenerate at the inner boundary of the cloak , irrespective of the space dimension .",
    "similarly , @xmath65 is a null vector on the inner boundary of the cloak only in space dimension @xmath66 .",
    "this analysis provides evidence that spherical cloaks should be easier to construct than circular cloaks .",
    "the parameters of the bio - cloak need to be further analysed in polar and spherical coordinates in order to simplify the cloak s design and the numerical implementation .",
    "we first note that if we multiply both sides of ( [ heat2 ] ) by @xmath67 and let @xmath67 inside the partial space derivatives , we retrieve the usual form of the convection - diffusion equation , albeit with anisotropic coefficients .",
    "we realise this is not legitimate in general as by doing so we add an extra term @xmath68 in ( [ heat2 ] ) , but we numerically checked that this term can be sufficiently small that it does not significantly affect the solution of the original transformed equation ( [ heat2 ] ) .",
    "physically , this manipulation results in preserving the direction of the diffusion flux @xmath69 ( since @xmath67 is a scalar ) .",
    "however , it affects its continuity ( since @xmath67 is heterogeneous ) .",
    "such a manipulation is known in the transformational optics community to lead to transformed equation with reduced parameters @xcite .",
    "we now observe that from the function @xmath70 counterpart of ( [ ndgeo ] ) , wherein @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in polar @xmath73 ( resp .",
    "spherical @xmath74 ) coordinates , which blows up a point @xmath35 to the disc ( resp .",
    "the sphere ) of radius @xmath75 and maps the disc ( resp .",
    "the sphere ) of radius @xmath76 to itself in polar @xmath77 ( resp .",
    "spherical @xmath78 ) coordinates , the transformed diffusivity can be expressed for a cylindrical cloak as : @xmath79    and for a spherical cloak as @xmath80 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the interior and the exterior radii of the cloak .",
    "one note that when @xmath81 tends to @xmath75 , @xmath82 goes to zero and @xmath83 remains constant in ( [ rhort1a ] ) , whereas @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 all go to zero in ( [ rhort1b ] ) .",
    "this means that thanks to the reduced coefficients the matrix of transformed diffusivity @xmath54 now has one eigenvalue which behaves like @xmath60 and one like @xmath61 as @xmath57 in the cylindrical case i.e. we no longer have an eigenvalue which blows up on the inner boundary of the cloak .",
    "likewise , we now have one eigenvalue which behaves like @xmath85 and two like @xmath86 , instead of one behaving like @xmath60 and two like @xmath61 when @xmath55 tends to zero , if we use reduced parameters in the spherical case .",
    "thus , reduced parameters are an obvious choice in the cylindrical case , since @xmath83 is a constant in ( [ rhort1a ] ) , and were implemented for thermal cloaks in @xcite . however , in spherical case , @xmath87 are no longer constant in ( [ rhort1b ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we need use such reduced coefficients to get rid of the coefficient sitting in front of the time derivative in ( [ heat2 ] ) .    these heterogeneous anisotropic ( reduced or not ) parameters can be approximated by piecewise constant isotropic coefficients , making use of an effective medium approach , as detailed in the supplementary material , which justifies the implementation of multilayered cylindrical and spherical cloaks with concentric isotropic homogeneous thin layers . the choice of reduced parameters led in @xcite to a multilayered thermal cloak with piecewise constant and high contrast diffusivity , and we refer to values of diffusivity and computations therein for the cloaking effect for a concentration of chemical species in 2d with 20 layers ( there is a one - to - one correspondence between fourier s heat equation and fick s equation , the unknown being either the temperature or the concentration )",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] of the present paper clearly shows cloaking can be achieved with simply 5 layers with moderate contrast in diffusivity . moreover , in the spherical case , the choice of reduced parameters leads to a different set of parameters ( see supplemental material ) for the multilayered bio - cloak , which we now study numerically .      for illustrative purposes , we focus here on a spherical cloak consisting of @xmath88 concentric layers with diffusitivity ranging from @xmath89m@xmath90.s@xmath91 to @xmath92m@xmath93.s@xmath91",
    ", further details can be found in the supplemental material . in order to emphasize the power of the approach",
    ", we now consider a cloak substantially larger than that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . indeed , as observed in @xcite in the context of the transformed heat equation , if we rescale the coordinate system as @xmath94 and the time variable @xmath95 with a dimensionless factor @xmath96 , the transformed fick s equation ( [ heat2 ] ) remains unchanged , provided we assume velocity is ruled out .",
    "more precisely , the cloak of fig . [ fig1 ] has been scaled up by a factor @xmath97 i.e. its inner radius @xmath98 m and its outer radius @xmath99 m in fig .",
    "accordingly , time should be scaled up by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "we show the distribution of concentration for a selectin of time points ranging from @xmath101s to @xmath102s in fig .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the cloak is in presence of a chemical specy with concentration normalised to @xmath103 mol.m@xmath104 for simplicity ( taking any other concentration @xmath105 will simply lead to a color scale in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ranging from @xmath106 to @xmath105 mol.m@xmath104 ) , which is set on the right - hand side of the computational domain ( a cube of sidelength @xmath107 m ) . on the opposite ( left - hand ) side",
    ", we set the usual flux condition @xmath108 ( with @xmath13 the , as yet unknown , solution to ( [ heat1 ] ) and @xmath109 the unit outward normal to each side of the cube ) , where @xmath15 varies within the range given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] inside the layers of the cloak ( see supplemental material for more details ) , and @xmath110 m@xmath90.s@xmath91 in the inner core and outside the spherical cloak and @xmath111 is the mass transfer coefficient , @xmath112 is the inward flux and @xmath113 is the bulk concentration of chemical species in the cubic domain . here , we consider @xmath114 mol.s@xmath91 , @xmath115 mol.m@xmath116.s@xmath91 and @xmath117 mol.m@xmath104 .",
    "finally , we set insulation ( or equivalent symmetry ) conditions @xmath118 on the four remaining sides of the cube . more details on implementation of such a diffusion model in finite elements",
    "may be found in @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological model of a bio - cloak exhibits the following features : the concentration of chemical species nearly vanishes inside the inner sphere of the bio - cloak at time @xmath119s , see fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) . in the optical setting ,",
    "such a sphere is called invisibility region , as no scattering obstacle placed inside this region can be detected @xcite . in a bio - physical setting , this zone acts as a protection from any potential chemical attack .",
    "however , the concentration of chemical species increases steadily over time until it reaches half the value of the concentration which is set on one side of the cubic computational domain , see fig . [ fig2](d ) .",
    "we note that the concentration is always uniform inside this inner sphere at any time point , see fig . [",
    "fig2](a)-(d ) .",
    "such a bio - cloak therefore offers some kind of protection from attack of chemical species since the concentration is uniform in its inner sphere at any time point and the concentration therein at any time point is always smaller than it would be without a cloak ( see supplemental material ) .",
    "moreover , it never exceeds a value , which in our configuration is half the applied concentration ( it can be seen that this is due to the fact that the cloak has its origin in the center of the cubic domain ) .",
    "in conclusion , in this brief communication we introduce a coordinate transformation approach to control diffusion processes via anisotropy with an emphasis on concentration of chemical species for potential applications in bio - physics or bio - engineering . not only does the form of the transformed convection - diffusion equation involve an anisotropic heterogeneous diffusivity , but it also requires a spatially varying coefficient in front of the time derivative , as well as an anisotropic heterogeneous velocity field . in order to be able to design a structured cloak for such diffusion processes",
    ", we have simplified this transformed equation by introducing so - called reduced coefficients , which preserve the direction of the diffusion flux ( but create an impedance mismatch between the cloak and surrounding medium ) and by further assuming a small velocity in a homogenization approach .",
    "our theoretical results are exemplified with numerical simulations in two- and three - dimensional settings .",
    "it should be emphasized that the issue of convection , which is of particular importance for diffusion in fluids , such as in living organisms , will require further comprehensive studies .",

    "<S> here , we adapt the concept of transformational thermodynamics , whereby the flux of temperature is controlled via anisotropic heterogeneous diffusivity , for the diffusion and transport of mass concentration . the n - dimensional , time - dependent , anisotropic heterogeneous fick s equation is considered , which is a parabolic partial differential equation also applicable to heat diffusion , when convection occurs , for example in fluids . </S>",
    "<S> this theory is illustrated with finite element computations for a liposome particle surrounded by a cylindrical multilayered cloak in a water - based environment , and for a spherical multilayered cloak consisting of layers of fluid with an isotropic homogeneous diffusivity , deduced from an effective medium approach . </S>",
    "<S> initial potential applications could be sought in bio - engineering . </S>"
