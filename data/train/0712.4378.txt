    "knowledge of the spin - dependent electronic structure at surfaces and interfaces plays an increasingly important role when assessing possible use of novel magnetic materials for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "a surface breaks the translation symmetry of a system and changes local quantities such as local density of states ( ldos ) which is significantly different from the bulk density of states ( dos ) .",
    "experimental study on magnetic surfaces has shown that the order - disorder phase transitions are affected by the surfaces and may differ markedly from that in the bulk @xcite . indeed , the atoms at the surface layer have fewer neighboring atoms in comparison with the bulk , and it is well know that the magnetic order is strongly modified due to the lower coordination number .",
    "moreover , the changes of the lattice constant near the magnetic surface also modify the exchange interaction constants .",
    "therefore , the reduced translational symmetry may decrease or increase the magnetic stability .    depending on the value of exchange coupling constant , two different behaviors at the surface",
    "can be obtained : ( i ) if the coupling constant is smaller than a critical valve , the bulk and surface ordering occur at the same temperature .",
    "this case is called _ ordinary transition_. experiments at the bulk curie temperature",
    "have shown that in general case , the magnetization of thin films and surfaces is lower than the bulk one , and as the thickness of the films decreases , the magnetization also decreases .",
    "ni and fe correspond to this kind of systems @xcite .",
    "( ii ) if the exchange coupling constant is larger than a critical value , which is itself larger than the bulk coupling constant , the curie temperature of thin films and surfaces is higher than the bulk curie temperature . this case",
    "is called _ surface transition _ where the surface layer alone orders , while the bulk remains disordered .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon was observed for various compounds , such as for example gd @xcite , tb @xcite and nio @xcite .",
    "however , for gd it should be mentioned that there are also newer studies claiming that no separate transition at the surface exists ( e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . challenges in experimental studies of surface magnetism stem from the difficulties of preparing and characterizing clean , structurally and magnetically ordered gd surfaces .    from theoretical point of view",
    ", the spin - dependent band structure of films and surfaces have been investigated in local - moment systems in which the magnetic moment originates from a partially filled shell of the atoms and being strictly localized at each magnetic ion site .",
    "@xcite studied the magnetism and the electronic structure of gd(0001 ) surface on the basis of density functional theory .",
    "@xcite investigated the temperature - dependent band structure of ferromagnetic semiconductor films and surfaces in the _ s - f _",
    "model @xcite . using a moment - conserving decoupling procedure for suitable",
    "defined green s functions , the layer - dependent magnetizations and the ldos were studied at different temperatures .",
    "the aim of this work is to present the single - site coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) for the _ s - f _ to investigate the spin - polarized surface states in local - moment systems . to our knowledge , this is the first detailed study of the surface effects on electron - spin polarization using the cpa . in this work , based on the single - site cpa for the _ s - f _ model , we intend to develop a theory for electronic states of a magnetic semi - infinite crystal , which is applicable in wide range of temperature and the _ s - f _ exchange coupling strength .",
    "the cpa is available when the scattering by the _ s - f _ exchange interaction is equivalent to the scattering by a completely random short - ranged potential . in this approximation",
    "the multiple scattering on the single site is taken into consideration .",
    "the single - site cpa gives reasonable results for both weak and strong exchange interaction limits , and hence is fairly good for any values of bandwidth , scattering potential and temperature @xcite .",
    "the single - site cpa , however , does not consider the exchange scattering caused by the _",
    "f_-spin correlation between different sites , which plays an important role around curie temperature in local moment systems .",
    "in fact , the collective mode , correlation , and/or clustering effect of localized spins are completely beyond the scope of the single - site cpa .    the crystal is assumed to consist of completely filled and well ordered ferromagnetic layers and its surface is flat .",
    "thus , the effects due to vacancies , islands , steps or intermixings on the magnetic properties are not considered here .",
    "however , the effect of magnetic anisotropy will be taken into account in the values of coupling constant between atoms on the surface of crystal .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii , by applying the single - site approximation to the _ s - f _ model , we present a theory to study the surface effects on the spin - dependent electronic states in a magnetic semi - infinite crystal . in appendix",
    "a , we obtain the green s function for a nonmagnetic semi - infinite crystal and in appendix b , a procedure is given for calculation of the layer - dependent magnetization in the frame work of the mean - field approximation .",

    "the direct exchange coupling between these localized moments is expressed by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the exchange coupling constant .",
    "the problem with the simple heisenberg model in the form ( [ hf ] ) is that the atoms of the topmost surface layer have fewer neighboring atoms than those of the bulk ; thus , the magnetic order is strongly modified by the coordination number .",

    ". thus the degree of electron - spin polarization at fermi energy @xmath92 and in layer @xmath14 can be given by @xmath93",
    "using the approach described in the previous section , we have studied the spin - polarized surface states for @xmath94=0.35 which corresponds to the intermediate _ s - f _ exchange interaction .",
    "first we investigate the spin - dependent electronic states in different positions .    in fig . 1 , we have shown the dos as a function of energy for a s.c",
    "crystal at @xmath95=0 , 0.5 , 0.8 @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that the largest spin - splitting between both spin - up and spin - down bands occurs at zero temperature . at this temperature ,",
    "the spin - up dos is similar to the dos of a nonmagnetic crystal . since at zero temperature ( completely ferromagnetic case )",
    "all the local moments are aligned at @xmath2-direction , the magnetic system is periodic . as a result ,",
    "the spin - up states are only shifted to the low energy side with no damping , and diminish at high energies where the coupling of the states are mainly antiparallel . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - down electrons can be flipped ; thus , the spin - down band is shifted to the high energy region , while the bottom of the spin - down band extends down . with increasing the temperature ,",
    "the local moments fluctuate and the spin - splitting between both spin bands decreases . at @xmath97 ,",
    "the spontaneous magnetization is zero and hence the dos are spin - independent .    in figs . 2 and 3",
    ", we have depicted the surface ldos for spin - up and spin - down electrons at different temperatures .",
    "the curves in fig . 2 correspond to the case in which the surface orders at a temperature @xmath98 ( surface transition ) larger than the bulk transition temperature @xmath99 . in this regard , we have chosen @xmath100=1.5 @xmath101 and @xmath102=1.15 @xmath101 . the curves in fig .",
    "3 , however correspond to the case in which both the bulk and the surface order at identical temperature ( ordinary transition ) . in such case we have assumed that @xmath100=0.8 @xmath101 and @xmath102=0.95 @xmath101 .",
    "if we consider the layer - dependent magnetization in fig .",
    "8 , we will see that , at low temperatures , the ldos in the case of surface transition is similar to those obtained in the case of ordinary transition . at zero temperature ,",
    "the spin - up ldos is similar to the surface ldos in a nonmagnetic semi - infinite crystal @xcite . with increasing temperature from zero to @xmath1030.5 @xmath99 , the ldos does not change considerably in both cases .",
    "the spin - splitting in the ldos is a measure of the electron - spin polarization which depends on the layer index .",
    "further increase of temperature , decreases the spin - splitting of the ldos .",
    "2 shows that , for the surface transition the spin - splitting is not zero at @xmath104 and even at @xmath1051.1 @xmath99 , however for the ordinary transition the spin - splitting will be zero at @xmath104 as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in figs . 4 and 5",
    "we have depicted the temperature and spin dependence of ldos in the second layer at the surface and ordinary transition cases , respectively .",
    "the electronic states slightly resemble the dos function for the infinite crystal . in this layer",
    "the spin - down band , as the previous electronic states , has a tail which reaches the edge of the spin - up band even at low temperatures . as the temperature increases , the spin - up ( -down ) ldos shifts to high ( low ) energy side",
    "; so that , at paramagnetic region the ldos for both spin - up and spin - down bands completely coincide to each other .",
    "it is clear that in all cases , there is a cusp in the ldos which is due to the @xmath9-@xmath20 exchange coupling strength .    if we compare the figs .",
    "2(f ) and 4(f ) ( at @xmath95=1.1 @xmath99 ) , we will find that the value of spin - splitting at the surface layer is slightly more than the first interior layer ( second layer ) .",
    "therefore , as one proceeds into the crystal , the value of spin polarization begins to decrease at temperatures higher than @xmath99 .",
    "when we are far enough from the surface , the surface effect on the spin polarization completely disappears and at @xmath106 the electron - spin polarization becomes zero .    in order to gain further insight into the surface effects on the ldos , we have shown in figs . 6 and 7 , the temperature dependence of the electron - spin polarization in both surface and ordinary transition cases for the first and second layers , respectively . in most of the magnetic phenomena at surfaces , interfaces and in thin films , such as spin - polarized electron emission and spin - polarized transport through a magnetic film , the electrons at the fermi surface play an essential role .",
    "therefore , the electron - spin polarization depends on the position of fermi energy . here , in both fig . 6 and 7 ,",
    "we have calculated the spin polarization at @xmath107 ( near the band edge ) and at @xmath108 ( near the band center ) . for comparison",
    ", we have shown the electron - spin polarization for the infinite crystal .",
    "it is clear that , in surface transition case when @xmath107 , the spin polarization on the surface ( @xmath14=1 ) and in the first interior layer ( @xmath14=2 ) is higher than the bulk one .",
    "the spin polarization on the surface layer differs with the bulk one at all temperatures .",
    "this difference near @xmath99 reaches its maximum value .",
    "however , due to the reduction of the spin polarization in the first interior layer in comparison with the surface layer , the difference in the spin polarization of this layer and the bulk appears above 0.6 @xmath99 .",
    "the difference of the spin polarizations between both layers and the bulk is originated from the strong exchange coupling with magnetic ions . at @xmath108 ,",
    "the spin polarizations have low values at all temperatures , because the difference between two spin bands is small .",
    "if we consider the ordinary transition case , we will see that , near @xmath99 that the surface magnetization has the most difference with the bulk one , the bulk spin polarization is more than the value of spin polarization at the layers @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we applied the present model for s.c .",
    "local moment systems such as eu chalcogenides .",
    "this model is also applicable to the case of hcp gd .",
    "however , for an atom at the gd(0001 ) surface , we have six nearest - neighbor atoms at the surface , and three nearest - neighbor atoms in the second layer .",
    "applying the molecular - field theory to the case of a hcp(0001 ) surface , we find that , for an exchange coupling ratio that satisfies @xmath109 , there is a surface transition @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath110 is the exchange coupling constant at the surface .",
    "it should be noted that , real surfaces are usually not perfectly smooth and display some degree of roughness due to the presence of surface defects , such as for example steps , islands , or vacancies .",
    "impurities are also often encountered at crystalline surfaces and may be viewed as the source of some disorder at the surface .",
    "all these defects have some impact on magnetic surface quantities .",
    "based on the single - site cpa , hong @xcite studied the ldos near a rough surface .",
    "the numerical results show that , the ldos depend sensitively on surface roughness . on the other hand , zhao et al .",
    "@xcite using ising - model monte carlo simulations have shown that surface roughness strongly affects surface magnetization , not only changing the surface magnetic ordering temperature but also modifying the magnitude of magnetization in a complex fashion . therefore , both the ldos and the surface magnetization are sensitive to the surface defects and consequently the resulting spin polarization is strongly influenced by the vacancies , islands , steps and the other surface defects .",
    "the above results show that the exchange coupling between the surface magnetic ions plays an important role in the degree of spin polarization for the emitted electrons from the free surface or the transmitted electrons through interfaces .",
    "hence , in designing the spin electronic or ",
    "spintronic \" devices the information about the surface effects on the degree of spin - polarization plays an essential role in generation of highly polarized electrons .",
    "in summary , we have presented a new formalism to study the spin - polarized surface states in the local moment systems .",
    "based on the single - site cpa for the _ s - f _ model and the mean - field theory for the layer - dependent magnetization we have investigated how the surface influences the spin - dependent electronic states . the effect of the semi - infinity of the crystal was taken into account by a localized perturbation method . assuming a s.c .",
    "band structure for the @xmath9 electrons we obtained the numerical results for the ldos and the electron - spin polarization for various temperatures and in two different behaviors at the surface ; ordinary and surface transitions .",
    "these transitions depend on the values of the exchange coupling constants between atoms on the surface and between atoms in the layers @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the results showed that in the surface transition case , in which the coupling constants are higher than the corresponding in the bulk , the surface curie temperature @xmath98 lies well above the bulk curie temperature .",
    "therefore , at @xmath111 the electron - spin polarization on the surface has a finite value , while the bulk spin polarization is zero .",
