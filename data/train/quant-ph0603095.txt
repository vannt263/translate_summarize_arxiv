    "one of the most intriguing quantum phenomena is the coherent evolution and control of a superposition of state vectors , which is at the heart of quantum parallelism in quantum computation schemes .",
    "one way to directly probe coherent quantum evolution is offered by the fidelity , which correlates the time evolution of a reference system with its slightly perturbed dynamics through @xmath0 . here ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the reference hamiltonian and its perturbed variant , respectively , which generate the evolution , starting from the same initial state @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 was introduced as a measure for the stability of quantum motion with respect to changes in some control parameter @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the fidelity has recently evoked considerable interest as an alternative route for the study of the effects of perturbations on the coherent evolution of quantum systems , in particular in the context of quantum - classical correspondence @xcite and of quantum information processing @xcite . as for the former ,",
    "the finite size of @xmath6 makes the classical definition of chaos through the exponential divergence of initially nearby trajectories meaningless on the quantum level .",
    "however , the sensitivity to changes in @xmath5 prevails both in the classical as well as in the quantum realm , and is dynamically quantified by @xmath4 .    whilst previous studies focused on the limit of small effective planck constant @xcite , we present in this letter an analytic result which is valid ( a ) in the _ deep quantum regime _ , and ( b ) for _ arbitrary _ values of the control parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we study the fidelity for cold , periodically kicked atoms , which mimic a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos theory , the @xmath7-kicked rotor ( kr ) @xcite . in this context , we show that bona fide fidelity is readily accessible , yet has never been measured in an experiment such as reported in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we derive an analytic expression for the fidelity at the fundamental quantum resonances of the kr . at these resonances , a subclass of the experimental atomic ensemble @xcite experiences an enhanced acceleration by the kicking field , at precisely defined kicking periods @xcite .",
    "we show that this resonantly driven subclass induces a slow algebraic decay of fidelity , whilst the bulk of the initial atomic ensemble produces the novel phenomenon of a perfect saturation of fidelity at a finite and experimentally easily detectable level .",
    "quantum resonances are of purely quantum origin , although it has been recently shown that they can be mapped onto a pseudo - classical problem . in this sense , we study the quantum fidelity in the deep quantum regime , far from the semiclassical limit of large actions , but close to the _ pseudo - classical _ limit . the latter anchors the near - resonant quantum dynamics to elliptic , stable resonance islands in the phase space of a suitably defined classical map , precisely alike the usual semiclassical limit",
    "however , the pseudoclassical limit is reached at fixed and finite @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this formal complication , the correspondence between ( pseudo)classically stable dynamics and near - resonant quantum evolution immediately suggests the remarkable robustness of the quantum dynamics at resonance , originally believed to be very sensitive to perturbations ( see @xcite for a further discussion ) .",
    "hence , quantum resonances provide a novel and _ robust _ tool of quantum control , and fall within a larger class of particularly robust modes originating from the dynamics of strongly perturbed quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this robustness manifests indeed in the temporal evolution of fidelity as shown in the sequel .",
    "the experimental realization @xcite of the kr uses cold atoms periodically kicked by an optical lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian that generates the evolution of the atomic wave function in its centre - of - mass degree of freedom is given in the following dimensionless form @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the momentum operator , and @xmath10 the atom s position along the pulsed optical lattice .",
    "the two parameters that control the dynamics are the kicking period @xmath11 , which takes the role of an effective planck constant in our units @xcite , and the kick strength @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describes the atom - optics kicked rotor ( aokr ) with the atoms moving along a line rather than on a circle ( as in the standard kr model ) .",
    "( [ ham ] ) induces the characteristic properties of the quantum kr , which sensitively depend on the parameter @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath13 , with @xmath14 integers , then the kicking period is rationally related to the propagation time of the kicked atoms across the lattice constant ( which is @xmath15 in our units ) , and quantum transport is enhanced .",
    "otherwise classically diffusive energy growth is suppressed by dynamical localisation @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we derive analytical results for the fidelity , for the experimentally relevant quantum resonances at @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , for _ large _ effective planck constants @xmath11 .",
    "an atom subject to a potential periodic in space and time is described by a wave packet composed of @xmath15-periodic bloch states , @xmath18 , with the quasimomentum @xmath19 . in our units ,",
    "the latter is given by the fractional part of the momentum @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath19 is a constant of motion , so the different bloch states evolve independently of one another , and their momenta only change by integers . at @xmath16 ,",
    "a special behaviour occurs only for a specific , small _ subclass _ of quasimomenta @xmath19 . in much the same way",
    "as spatial periodicity enforces ballistic motion in physical space , the one - period evolution operator is periodic in momentum space , enforcing ballistic propagation of the corresponding @xmath19-states in momentum space .",
    "as shown in @xcite , during one period @xmath11 , @xmath21 evolves into @xmath22 , with @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "for instance , at @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , or at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the second factor of @xmath30 equals the identity ( apart from a global phase for @xmath31 ) , and the energy of the corresponding @xmath19-state grows ballistically , _",
    "i.e. _ , quadratically with the number @xmath32 of kicks @xcite . for general values of @xmath19 , but @xmath33 , @xmath34 integer , the state after the @xmath32th kick is , in the momentum representation @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "if the initial state of the atom is a plane wave of momentum @xmath37 , then @xmath38 takes the constant value @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , then @xmath41 , else if @xmath42 then @xmath43 , and the average kinetic energy increases like @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the latter occurs at the resonant values @xmath45 mod@xmath46 , @xmath47 , which support _ ballistic _",
    "motion @xcite .",
    "the remaining bloch components of the original wave packet , with @xmath19 not belonging to the resonant subclass , undergo a quasiperiodic energy exchange with the kicking field , leading to a",
    "_ finite _ spread of the associated momentum distribution for all times @xcite .",
    "how does a perturbation in the kick strength @xmath12 affect such quantum dynamics at quantum resonance  brought about by the abovementioned complete phase revival in - between two successive kicks ?",
    "the answer to this question will be given by computing the fidelity of the resonant time evolution , using eq .",
    "( [ ubeta1 ] ) for two different values of @xmath12 . before doing so",
    ", we show how to extract the fidelity from observables directly measurable in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the experiment uses two sublevels of the atomic ground state of the electronic degree of freedom , which couple differently to the kick potential . before the kicks are applied , the sublevels are equally populated , and then evolve coherently .",

    ", we assume instantaneous ramsey pulses which occur immediately before the first and after the last kick , respectively .",
    "these pulses couple the two states whilst they evolve coherently , but independently , under the kicking potential .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) can be accessed experimentally by measuring the atomic momentum distribution .",
    "the measurement , however , provides only an _ average over all _ @xmath19 in the initial ensemble @xcite .",
    "thus , when the initial pure state @xmath64 ( of the atomic centre - of - mass motion ) is replaced by a mixture which is described by the statistical density operator @xmath65 the final , measurable population in state @xmath66 is @xmath67 we defined @xcite @xmath68 where , at fixed time @xmath32 , @xmath69 differs from @xmath70 , as well as from @xmath57 by a constant shift , and @xmath71 corresponds to the fidelity for an incoherent ensemble of @xmath19-states . from this analysis , we see that the fidelity is equal to the squared difference between the maximum and the minimum values taken by @xmath72 , while the original phase @xmath57 varies in @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "hence , the fidelity is accessible as the visibility of the integrated momentum distribution ( [ eq:2 ] ) as a function of the ramsey phase @xmath57 by the experimental setup of fig .",
    "[ fig : ramsey ] .",
    "one must , however , explicitly take into account the scan of the ramsey phase , in contrast to what has been dubbed `` fidelity '' in @xcite .",
