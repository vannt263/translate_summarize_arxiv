    "the most common approach to the description of a trapped bose - condensed gas is based on the mean - field approximation , which yields the gross - pitaevski equation for the macroscopic wave function .",
    "this wave function , which depends on the number of atoms , plays the role of the mode function for the maxwell field .",
    "this approach is reliable when the condensate is trapped in a single quantum state in a potential well .",
    "however , when the condensate is separated into two or more parts , so that more than one quantum state is populated , the mean - field approach is not evidently justified . it has been shown by javanainen and yoo @xcite that two originally separate parts of a condensate that are initially in a fock state and that are brought to overlap will reveal an interference pattern that varies in position from one realization to another .",
    "this effect , which has also been observed experimentally @xcite can not be described by a single macroscopic wavefunction .",
    "a simple model for a condensate in a double potential well is defined by a field - theoretical hamiltonian for a boson - hubbard dimer @xcite , which can be expressed in terms of su(2 ) angular momentum - type operators with a quadratic term .",
    "this latter term represents the interaction between atoms in a well .",
    "the mean - field approximation is basically equivalent to classical equations of motion for the expectation values of the su(2 ) operators @xcite .",
    "the quantum regime has mainly been studied numerically , leading to collapse and revival @xcite , and to non - classical dynamics arising from the periodic modulation of the coupling between the wells @xcite .",
    "the formation of a two - well condensate by the raising of the barrier has been analyzed theoretically @xcite .",
    "the situation of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a two - well trap is also studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "a very similar hamiltonian describes the situation of an atom diffracting from a standing - wave optical potential .",
    "this problem has received attention already in the early days of laser cooling @xcite .",
    "more recent work has developed the band structure of the energy spectrum @xcite , and a number of regimes have been distinguished that allow an analytical description @xcite . in a simple version of the model ,",
    "the hamiltonian is identical in form as in the two - well problem mentioned above .",
    "now the quadratic term represent the kinetic energy of the atom .",
    "the only difference between the two cases is that the commutation rules for the operators in the diffraction case are slightly simplified compared to the case of su(2 ) symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the analogy and the differences between these two systems .",
    "we point that a number of analytical solutions known for the diffraction problem can be carried over to the two - well system .",
    "the physics of these cases is discussed .",
    "we consider a potential consisting of two wells .",
    "when the barrier between the wells is not too low , the ground state and the first excited state @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a single atom are well approximated as the even and odd superposition of the lowest bound states in the two wells .",
    "therefore , these states can be described as @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the localized states in either well . when the energy separation between the excited and the ground state is indicated as @xmath5 ,",
    "the off - diagonal element of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath6 between the localized states is @xmath7 at the low energies that are of interest here , the two particle interaction is well approximated by the standard contact potential @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the scattering length .",
    "the second - quantized field operator is now @xmath10 in terms of the wavefunctions @xmath11 and the annihilation operators @xmath12 of the single - particle states .",
    "the annihilation operators and the corresponding creation operators obey the standard bosonic commutation rules .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath13 the wavefunctions @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the localized states have the same form , and we assume that they do not overlap . then the interaction term can be expressed exclusively in the parameter @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 which measures the strength of the interatomic interaction . performing the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ hamfield ] ) leads to the expression for the hamiltonian @xmath18 where we took the zero of energy halfway the two energy levels of a single atom .",
    "this is also known as the boson - hubbard dimer hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ bec3 ] ) can also be expressed in terms of su(2 ) operators by applying the standard schwinger representation of two modes .",
    "this leads to the definition @xmath19 these operators are related to the cartesian components of angular momentum by the standard relations @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ bec3 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 the operator for the total number of particles .",

    "the presence of the quadratic term makes the dynamics considerably more complex .",
    "therefore we compare this dynamics with another well - known case in which a similar quadratic term appears .",
    "the translational motion of a two - level atom in a far detuned standing - wave light field is described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath48 with @xmath49 the difference of the resonance frequency and the optical frequency , and @xmath50 the rabi frequency of each of the travelling waves that make up the standing wave .",
    "the hamiltonian takes a particularly simple form in momentum representation , since the kinetic - energy term is diagonal in momentum , and the potential energy changes the momentum by @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we introduce momentum eigenstates @xmath52 which have the momentum @xmath53 . then apart from an irrelevant constant , the hamiltonian ( [ lattice2 ] ) can be represented in the algebraic form @xmath54 where @xmath55 determines the kinetic energy term , and @xmath56 the atom - field coupling .",
    "the operators occurring on the r.h.s . are defined by the relations @xmath57 they differ from the corresponding relations ( [ jpm ] ) in that now the strength of the hopping operators is uniform .",
    "this hamiltonian ( [ lattice12 ] ) has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ hn ] ) , even though they describe completely different physical situations .",
    "the difference is mathematically characterized by the commutation relations . the su(2 ) relations ( [ bec6 ] ) are replaced by the simpler set @xmath58=\\pm \\text { } \\widehat{b}_{\\pm } \\;,\\;[\\widehat{b}_{+},\\widehat{b}_{-}]=0\\ ; ,   \\label{lattice6}\\ ] ] which is easily found from their explicit expressions ( [ lattice4 ] ) .",
    "the two operators @xmath59 are found to commute .",
    "a result of this difference is that the state space in the two - well case has a finite dimension @xmath60 , whereas the momentum space has an infinite number of dimensions .",

    "we recall three approximate solutions of the evolution governed by the hamiltonian ( [ lattice12 ] ) , which are valid in different situations , and which allow analytical solutions .",
    "the raman - nath regime is valid for interaction times that are so short that the atom has no time to propagate .",

    "the matrix elements of the resulting evolution operator for the pulse can be found by operator algebra in the form @xcite @xmath65 in terms of bessel functions .",

    "the probability of transfer of @xmath32 units of momentum is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "the bragg regime is valid when the coupling @xmath69 between neighboring momentum states is small compared to the kinetic - energy separation @xmath70 of the initial state @xmath52 from its neighboring states @xmath71 .",
    "this initial state leads to an oscillating time - dependent state between the two states @xmath52 and @xmath72 with the same kinetic energy @xmath73 apart from an overall phase factor .",
    "this can only occur when the momentum transfer @xmath74 ( in units of @xmath75 ) is an integer , which corresponds precisely to the bragg condition .",

    "the adiabaticity condition in the present case reads @xmath77 when an atom passes a standing wave with a sufficiently smooth variation of the intensity , and the bragg condition is fulfilled , the presence of two initially degenerate eigenstates @xmath78 leads to interference after the passage , which produces two outgoing beams .",
    "because of the similarity between the two hamiltonians ( [ hn ] ) and ( [ lattice12 ] ) , these well - known diffraction cases can be expected to have analogies in the dynamics of the two - well problem .",
    "the hamiltonians ( [ hn ] ) and ( [ lattice12 ] ) can be represented in the generic form @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , where the operators @xmath82 represent @xmath83 or @xmath84 , depending on the commutation rules and the corresponding algebra that they obey . in the two - well case ,",

    "the states @xmath85 are momentum eigenstates . in this latter case ,",
    "the coupling between neighboring momentum states is independent of @xmath41 ( eq . ( [ lattice4 ] ) ) , whereas in the two - well case the @xmath41-dependence of the hopping operator indicated in eq . ( [ jpm ] ) reflects the bosonic accumulation effect .",
    "a consequence of this is also that the hamiltonian in the diffraction case couples an infinite number of states @xmath87 , whereas in the two - well case the number of coupled states has the finite value @xmath29 . in the diffraction case",
    "we restrict ourselves to the situation that the bragg condition is respected .",
    "therefore , both in the diffraction case and in the two - well case @xmath41 attains either integer or half - integer values .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ lattice10 ] ) is invariant for inversion of @xmath41 . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we introduce the inversion operator @xmath88 , defined by the relation @xmath89 . in the diffraction case",
    ", the operator @xmath88 corresponds to inversion of momentum , which does not change the kinetic energy . in the two - well case",
    ", the operator @xmath88 represents interchanging the particle numbers in the two wells , which has no effect on the interparticle interaction .",
    "the commutation rules of the inversion operator with the operators @xmath90 are specified by @xmath91 , @xmath92 , so that @xmath88 inverts @xmath93 and @xmath86 , and commutes with @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that the hamiltonian ( [ lattice10 ] ) commutes with @xmath88 , so that it is invariant for inversion of @xmath41 . therefore the hamiltonian has vanishing matrix elements between the even and the odd subspaces , which are the eigenspaces of @xmath95 with eigenvalue @xmath33 and @xmath96 respectively . for half - integer @xmath97-values ,",
    "these spaces are spanned by the states @xmath98 for positive values of @xmath99 in the case of integer @xmath41-values , the state @xmath100 also belongs to the even subspace .",

    "the action of the coupling term in the hamiltonian can be expressed in a general form by introducing coefficients @xmath104 for non - negative values of @xmath41 . in the case of the su(2 ) algebra , we define @xmath105 , whereas in the diffraction case we simply have @xmath106 .",

    "the only difference is that the even subspace also contains the state @xmath116 , which is coupled to the other states by the matrix element @xmath117    in both cases , the difference between the hamiltonian parts on the even and odd subspaces are proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "these differences are responsible for the energy splitting between the even and the odd energy eigenstates . moreover , since these differences in the hamiltonian parts occur for low values of @xmath41 , we expect that the even - odd energy splittings get small for large @xmath41-values .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical calculations . in figs . 1 and 2 we display the energy levels of the hamiltonian , for a few values of @xmath118 , both for the double - well case ( with @xmath119 ) , and for the diffraction case .",
    "the energy levels are found to be alternatingly even and odd , with increasing energy . in the two - well case ,",
    "the energy shifts and splittings due to the coupling are larger for the same value of @xmath118 and the same value of @xmath41 .",
    "this arises from the factor @xmath104 , which is unity in the diffraction case , whereas in the two - well case it decreases from @xmath120 at @xmath121 to zero at @xmath122 .",
    "in fact , the condition for weak coupling is that matrix elements coupling the states @xmath108 and @xmath123 are small compared with their unperturbed energy separation .",
    "this condition can be expressed as @xmath124 in the two - well case , the lowest energy states start out to be nearly equidistant up to @xmath41-values where @xmath125 approaches one .",

    ", the bragg condition is fulfilled when the inequality ( [ criteria ] ) holds .",

    "this describes a state of the condensate atoms in the double well in the weak - coupling limit . in this case , the state oscillates between the fock states @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    obviously , when the initial state is given by @xmath146 , the system is in a stationary state , and no oscillations occur . in this case ,",
    "pendellsung oscillations can still be induced by including in the hamiltonian a term that is linear in @xmath86 . in the diffraction case",

    "when this term is periodically varying , it can be used for coherent control of the condensate @xcite .",
    "the additional term couples the even and odd subspaces , thereby breaking the symmetry opf the hamiltonian .",
    "on the basis of the states @xmath150 the effective hamiltonian attains the off - diagonal element @xmath151 when we assume that both @xmath69 and @xmath152 are small compared with the splitting due to the interparticle interaction @xmath16 , so that we remain in the bragg regime , the two states @xmath129 remain decoupled from the other number states , and we have an effective two - state system . in practice , the parameter @xmath152 can be easily controlled , so that many effects of two - state atoms @xcite can also realized for these two states .",
    "for example , in analogy to the excitation of ground - state by an adiabatic sweep across the resonance , one could create an effective transfer from the state @xmath108 to the state @xmath153 by varying the parameter @xmath152 adiabatically from a positive to a negative value that is large compared to @xmath134 .",
