    "billiard models , in which point particles in free motion undergo elastic collisions with fixed obstacles , have simple microscopic dynamics but strong ` statistical ' behavior , such as diffusion , at the macroscopic level .",
    "the statistical properties of scattering billiards such as the lorentz gas , which have smooth , convex scatterers , are well - understood : see e.g.  @xcite for a collection of reviews .",
    "recently , however , models with _ polygonal _ scatterers have attracted attention , since they are only weakly chaotic , with for example all lyapunov exponents being @xmath3 , but they still exhibit surprising statistical properties in numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in polygonal billiards depends strongly on the angles of the billiard table .",
    "some rigorous results are available for angles which are all _ rational _ , i.e.  rational multiples of @xmath0 : see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , an initial condition with a given angle can not explore the whole phase space , since the possible angles obtained in the resulting trajectory are restricted , so that the model does not have good ergodic properties .",
    "previous numerical work has shown that if one angle is rational and the others irrational , then the results are sensitive to the value of the rational angle @xcite .    in this work",
    "we restrict our attention to the case in which all angles are _ irrational _ multiples of @xmath0 .",
    "there are few rigorous results available in this case , but there is numerical evidence that the dynamics is mixing in irrational triangles @xcite .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations of the transport properties of quasi - one - dimensional polygonal channel billiards ; here we report detailed results for two classes of model . in both",
    "we find that transport _ generically _ corresponds to what is usually referred to as normal diffusion , i.e.  linear growth of the mean squared displacement , when the particles can not travel arbitrarily long distances without collisions ( finite horizon ) .",
    "by ` generic ' we mean that the set of models which do not exhibit normal diffusion is ` small ' , for example having measure zero in the space of geometrical parameters .",
    "similarly , for the infinite horizon case we find that transport is generically _ marginally _ super - diffusive , i.e.  there is a logarithmic correction to the linear growth law of the mean squared displacement .",
    "however , we also find exceptions to the generic behaviors described above .",
    "these exceptions occur when there are _ parallel scatterers _ in the unit cell which are accessible from one another ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : anomalous - diffusion ] for the definition ) . in such cases",
    "we always find super - diffusion , i.e.  the mean squared displacement grows like a power law with exponent greater than @xmath2 .",
    "further , we demonstrate that as a parallel configuration is approached , the transition from normal to anomalous diffusion occurs through a power - law divergence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we also show that the exponents we obtain are not consistent with a simple continuous - time random walk model of anomalous diffusion .",
    "our results are consistent with previous observations of irrational models exhibiting normal @xcite and anomalous @xcite diffusion .",
    "also , very recently , numerical results corresponding to one of the models studied in this work were reported in @xcite , where it was also observed that parallel scatterers result in anomalous diffusion ; the results we obtain complement and extend those of that reference .",
    "energy transport in polygonal billiards placed between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures has also been a focus of attention @xcite .",
    "this process is closer to `` color diffusion '' than to heat conduction due to the absence of particle interactions and , hence , of local thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite . in these systems",
    "the properties of the energy transport process are known to be closely related to those of the particle diffusion process @xcite , and for this reason we only study the latter .",
    "the unit cells of our models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poly - billiard - mine ] ; the complete channel consists of an infinite horizontal periodic repetition of such cells . the _ polygonal lorentz model _ is a polygonal channel version of the lorentz gas channel studied in @xcite , consisting of a quasi-1d channel with an extra square scatterer at the center of each unit cell . by _",
    "quasi-1d _ we mean that particles are confined to a strip infinitely extended in the @xmath4-direction but of bounded height in the @xmath5-direction .",
    "the polygonal lorentz model can be simplified by eliminating the central scatterer and flipping the bottom line of scatterers to point upwards , resulting in the quasi-1d _ zigzag model_. both models are designed to permit a _",
    "finite horizon _ by blocking all infinite corridors in the structure , so that there is an upper bound on the distance a particle can travel without colliding with a scatterer ; in scattering billiards this condition was shown to be necessary for normal diffusion to occur @xcite .",
    "the zigzag model has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the zigzag model with parallel sides can be reduced to a parallelogram with irrational angles .",
    "this simple billiard geometry seems to have been neglected previously , although it is close to a model considered in @xcite which was reported to exhibit a very slow exploration of phase space .",
    "we have found similar behavior in the parallel zigzag model ( see also @xcite ) , but it appears to be a peculiarity of this model which is not necessarily shared by other polygonal billiards exhibiting anomalous diffusion .      in our simulations",
    "we distribute @xmath6 initial conditions ( unless otherwise stated ) uniformly with respect to liouville measure , i.e.with positions distributed uniformly in the available space in one unit cell , and velocities with unit speed and uniformly distributed angles .",
    "we consider only irrational angles for the billiard walls in each model , although we vary explicitly scatterer heights rather than angles , and to fix the length scale we take @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : poly - billiard - mine ] ) .",

    "is the mean squared displacement @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , which is frequently used to characterize the transport properties of such systems .",
    "in this paper , by _ normal diffusion _ we mean asymptotic linear growth of the mean squared displacement @xmath11 as a function of time @xmath9 , which we denote by @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "this is characteristic of systems commonly thought of as ` diffusive ' , for example random walkers which take uncorrelated steps of finite mean squared length .",
    "strongly chaotic dynamical systems , such as the lorentz gas , are known to exhibit normal diffusive behavior @xcite ; this arises due to a fast decay of correlations , even between neighboring trajectories , so that after a short correlation time the dynamics looks ` random ' .",
    "it is rather surprising , then , that normal diffusion also seems to appear in non - chaotic polygonal billiards @xcite in which correlations do not decay exponentially . in these systems ,",
    "the only source of ` randomization ' arises due to divergence of neighboring trajectories colliding on different sides of a corner of the billiard : see e.g.  @xcite for a recent attempt to characterise this randomization effect .    in the following , we present sensitive tests which provide strong confirmation that , apart from exceptional cases , the decorrelation induced by the randomization mechanism mentioned above is indeed sufficient to give rise to normal diffusion in polygonal billiards . in particular our tests distinguish the logarithmic correction ( marginally anomalous diffusion ) which arises generically in these systems when they have infinite horizon , as it does in fully chaotic billiards .",
    "we will see that exceptions to these behaviors occur when the billiards present accesible parallel walls . in such cases",
    "we argue that long time correlations persist , related to the existence of families of travelling periodic orbits , which always give rise to anomalous diffusion .",

    "we have demonstrated that the type of diffusive behavior exhibited by periodic polygonal billiard channels depends on geometrical features of the unit cell . based on our results , we conjecture that sufficient conditions for a periodic polygonal billiard channel to exhibit normal diffusion are the following : ( i ) all vertex angles are irrationally related to @xmath0 ; ( ii ) the billiard has a finite horizon ; and ( iii ) there are no accessible parallel scatterers in the unit cell .",

    "the exponents are seemingly close to @xmath2 , while for the polygonal lorentz model we find normal diffusion in similar situations . for the zigzag model we must",

    "we remark that in @xcite , propagating periodic orbits were conjectured to be related to anomalous diffusion in a system with one rational angle , but no reason was given for their existence . actually , it is possible to include that system into our picture by unfolding the rational angle , which gives rise to an equivalent system with parallel scatterers .",
    "we believe that the explanation of anomalous diffusion should be found in terms of such propagating periodic orbits , which are much more prevalent in the presence of parallel scatterers .",
