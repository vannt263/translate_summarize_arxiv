    "in this paper we introduce cube diagrams  special piecewise - linear embeddings of a link into a 3-dimensional cartesian grid  and develop a number of basic results about them .",
    "cube diagrams have many of the same features as grid diagrams ( cf .",
    "cromwell @xcite ) .",
    "for example , cube diagrams can easily be programmed into computers , which makes many invariants of cube diagrams directly computable .",
    "the data structure of a cube diagram encodes the knot as it is embedded in the cube",
    ". therefore it may be possible to derive finer invariants than invariants derived from knot projections .",
    "first we describe a set of criteria to determine whether a property of cube diagrams is an invariant of a link .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    [ maintheorem1 ] two cube diagrams correspond to ambient isotopic oriented links if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of cube stablizations / destablizations and cube commutations .",
    "cube stabilzations / destabilzations and cube commutations are similar to the moves described for grid diagrams ; we explain these moves on a cube diagram in more detail in section  [ invariantmoves ] . as an immediate corollary",
    ", we get a simple new way to check for knot and link invariants :    [ maincorollary ] any property of a cube diagram that does not change under cube stabilizations / destabilzations and cube commutations is an invariant of the link .",
    "there are generally two ways to define knot invariants  either work with the manifold @xmath0 directly ( ie .",
    "the fundamental group , alexander modules , etc . ) or work with 2-dimensional representations of the knot .",
    "knot projections are particularly useful because the @xmath1-dimensional moves ( e.g. reidemeister moves , markoff moves , etc . )",
    "are restrictive enough to make checking invariance easy . furthermore , many invariants defined using knot projections are computable ( a.k.a kauffman brackets ) . on the other hand , simple , easy - to - check set of @xmath2-dimensional moves ( like triangle moves ) that take an embedded link in @xmath3 to an isotopy of itself are generally ineffective for defining and computing knot invariants : such isotopy moves are simply too flexible to allow one to define invariants ( without working directly with the topology of @xmath4 ) .",
    "cube diagrams are the authors attempt to `` split the difference '' between the flexibility of isotopy in @xmath3 and specific , controllable moves in a knot projection .",
    "our main goal in defining cube diagrams and proving theorem  [ maintheorem1 ] is to develop a data structure that describes an embedding of a knot in @xmath3 such that ( 1 ) every link is represented by a cube diagram , ( 2 ) the data structure is rigid enough to easily define invariants , yet ( 3 ) cube stabilization and cube commutation moves are all that are necessary to transform one cube diagram of a link into any other cube diagram of the same link .    as an example of the usefulness of cube diagrams we present a filtered homology theory for a link @xmath5 defined from cube diagram @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "the chain complex @xmath7 of the homology theory is generated by cube states  certain configurations of lattice points on the @xmath2-dimensional cartesian grid .",
    "each cube state has an associated maslov and alexander grading . the differential @xmath8 counts the number of empty cylinders between two cube states , and decreases the maslov grading by one .",

    "then @xmath13    even though the homology theory is determined by knot floer homology , there are no known constructions using heegaard surface decompositions that reproduce this homology",

    "does seiberg - witten - floer homology have an interpretation using cube diagrams ? 3",
    ".   can classical link invariants be categorified from a cube diagram perspective ?",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we give the definition of a cube diagram and show that every link can be represented by a cube diagram . in section 3",
    "we describe stabilization / destabilzation and commutation moves and prove theorem  [ maintheorem1 ] using them .",

    "note that cube diagrams have similar features to lattice knots , but the conditions on a cube diagram are far more restrictive .",
    "cube diagrams have a nice relationship with grid diagrams , combinatorial structures that encode information about link projections .",
    "grid diagrams were introduced by brunn  @xcite over a 100 years ago , and discussed more recently in cromwell  @xcite . a _ grid diagram _ is usually defined as an @xmath31 subset of the cartesian grid such that each cell contains either an @xmath32 , or nothing , which are arranged so that :    * each row contains exactly one @xmath21 marking and exactly one @xmath33 marking , and + * each column contains exactly one @xmath21 marking and exactly one @xmath33 marking .",
    "the grid diagram specifies an oriented link projection by drawing horizontal line segments in each row from the @xmath33 to the @xmath21 and vertical line segments in each column from the @xmath21 to the @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , at intersection points , the vertical segment are overcrossings .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the set of @xmath21 markings and @xmath33 markings respectively .",
    "we need an equivalent definition of a grid diagram that takes into account the orientation of the grid . given a @xmath16\\times [ 0,n ] \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}^2 $ ] cartesian grid with labeled axes , define an orientation on the grid diagram by choosing an ordering of the axes : then `` rows '' and `` horizontal segments '' in the definition above are rows and segments parallel to the first axis chosen , and `` columns '' and `` vertical segments '' are rows and segments parallel to the second axis chosen .",
    "at each intersection point , the segment parallel to the second axis chosen is the overcrossing .",
    "the orientation of the link itself is defined similarly .",
    "for example , the first picture in figure  [ or ] shows the @xmath28-orientation and the second picture shows the @xmath36-orientation for a grid diagram . notice that changing the orientation of a grid diagram changes the link to the reverse of its mirror .    -oriented grid diagram and the figure on the right is a grid diagram with the same data structure but with the @xmath36-orientation . ]",
    "the data structure of a cube diagram can be naturally projected onto an oriented grid diagram in a way that respects orientation , overcrossings , and markings . as an example",
    "we show how to project the link in a cube diagram onto the @xmath37-plane .",
    "cube diagrams are populated by three types of markings ( @xmath38 and @xmath23 ) while grid diagrams only have two ( @xmath21 and @xmath33 ) ; there is a preferred way to identifying the markings on the cube with the markings in the grid .",
    "in this example , the @xmath23 markings in the cube are projected to @xmath21 markings in the grid .",
    "the other two markings , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , both get projected to @xmath33 markings in the grid .",

    "call this identification of markings a _ projection _ of the cube diagram onto the @xmath28-oriented grid diagram ( thought of as data structures ) and say that it is the _",

    "figure  [ gooddia ] shows the different projections of a cube diagram .    , @xmath29 , and @xmath30-oriented grid diagrams .",
    "notice that it is possible to recover the cube diagram from any two of the projected grid diagrams . ]",
    "a corollary of the proposition above relates grid numbers to cube numbers of a link .",
    "the _ grid number of a link _ is the minimum grid number over all grid diagrams of that link .",
    "similarly , the _ cube number of a link _ is the minimum cube number over all cube diagrams of the link .",
    "the grid number of a link is less than or equal to the cube number of that link .",
    "example  [ ex : badgriddia ] in the next section suggests that this inequality may be a strict .      in this section we show that every link can be represented by a cube diagram .",
    "one way to prove this fact is to show that every closed braid can be embedded in a cube diagram .",
    "this procedure produces cube diagrams with large cube number , even for braids with a small number of crossings .",
    "an efficient way to produce a cube diagram is to show that a grid diagram gives rise to a cube diagram .",
    "but not every grid diagram does so :    there exists grid diagrams which can not be the projections of cube diagrams .",
    "[ ex : badgriddia ]    to describe the example we need a bit of terminology .",
    "a _ bend _ in a grid diagram for a link @xmath5 is a pair of segments in @xmath5 which meet at a common @xmath21 or @xmath33 marking ( see figure [ bend ] ) .",
    "each link component is the union of non - overlapping bends . for a component of the link",
    "there are two partitions of non - overlapping bends depending on whether the two segments in each bend intersect in an @xmath21 or @xmath33 marking .",
    "let @xmath41 be a collection of such partitions , one partition for each component of the link ( e.g. , pick all bends that intersect at an @xmath21 marking ) .",
    "then @xmath42 equals the grid number of @xmath43 .",

    "twisted_.    the example is the grid diagram pictured in figure  [ badgrid ] . without loss of generality , give the above grid diagram the @xmath28-orientation .",
    "there are exactly two partitions of the link into a set of bends . for either partition ,",
    "the bends in the partition must correspond to the set of @xmath20-cube bends in the cube .",
    "note that for both partitions there is a pair of twisted bends @xmath46 and @xmath47 that intersect each other twice .",
    "so if there existed a cube diagram for this partition that projected to the grid diagram , @xmath46 and @xmath47 would be @xmath20-cube bends in that cube , and therefore the @xmath20-coordinate for @xmath46 would both be greater than and less than the @xmath20-coordinate for @xmath47 , which is a contradiction .",
    "however , a grid diagram with no twisted bends does potentially come from a projection of a cube diagram .",
