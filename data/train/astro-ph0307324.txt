    "warped accretion disks are believed to exist in a variety of astrophysical systems , including x - ray binaries , young stellar objects ( ysos ) and active galactic nuclei .",
    "for example , the well - known 164 day precession of the jet in ss 433 and the long - term variabilities observed in many x - ray binaries ( e.g. her x-1 , lmc x-4 ; see priedhorsky & holt 1987 ; scott et al .",
    "2000 ; ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) have been explained by the precession of tilted accretion disks .",
    "the changes in the flow directions of several yso jets ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "2000 ) and the photometric variabilities of some t tauri stars ( e.g. , aa tauri ; see bouvier et al .  1999 ; carpenter et al .",
    "2001 ) have also been associated with warped , precessing disks .",
    "several mechanisms for exciting / maintaining warps in accretion disks have been proposed in recent years .",
    "schandl & meyer ( 1994 ) considered a warping instability due to irradiation - driven disk wind .",
    "pringle ( 1996 ) showed that even without wind loss , radiation pressure itself can induce warping in the outer region of the disk ( see also maloney , begelman & nowak 1998 ; wijers & pringle 1999 ; ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) . quillen ( 2001 ) showed that a wind passing over the disk surface may induce warping via kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "finally , in the case of disk accretion onto magnetic stars ( e.g. , neutron stars , white dwarfs and t tauri stars ) , the stellar magnetic field can induce disk warping and precession ( lai 1999 ; see also terquem & papaloizou 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with these magnetic effects on accretion disks .",
    "the study of disk accretion onto magnetic stars has a long history ( e.g. , pringle & rees 1972 ; ghosh & lamb 1979 ; anzer & brner 1980 ,  1983 ; lipunov & shakura 1980 ; wang 1987 ,  1995 ; aly & kuijpers 1990 ; spruit & taam 1993 ; shu et al .",

    "; campbell 1997 ; lai 1998 ; see also numerical simulations by hayashi et al .",
    "1996 ; miller & stone 1997 ; goodson et al .  1997 ; fendt & elstner 2000 ; romanova et al .",
    "most previous studies have , for simplicity , adopted the idealized geometry in which the magnetic axis , the spin axis and the disk angular momentum are aligned .",
    "however , it was shown in lai ( 1999 ) that under quite general conditions , the stellar magnetic field can induce warping in the inner disk and make the disk precess around the spin axis ( see  2 ; see also aly 1980 ; lipunov & shakura 1980 ; terquem & papaloizou 2000 ) .",
    "such magnetically driven warping and precession open up new possibilities for the dynamical behaviors of disk accretion onto magnetic stars .",
    "shirakawa & lai ( 2002a ) studied these effects in weakly magnetized accreting neutron stars and showed that the magnetic warping / precession effects may explain several observed features of low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "shirakawa & lai ( 2002b ) also studied the linear , global warping / precession modes of inner disks of highly magnetized ( @xmath0  g ) neutron stars ( nss ) , as in accreting x - ray pulsars , and suggested that magnetically driven disk warping and precession can explain the mhz variabilities observed in x - ray pulsars .",
    "the studies by shirakawa & lai ( 2002a , b ) were restricted to linear warping .",
    "such linear analysis is only the first step toward understanding the observational manifestations of the magnetic warping / precession effects .",
    "however , as we show in this paper , under many circumstances , the disk warping becomes nonlinear , and the dynamics of nonlinear warped disks is much richer .",
    "this is the subject of this paper .",
    "after briefly reviewing the basic physics of magnetically driven disk warping and precession (  2 ) , we present the dynamical equations for the warped disk (  3 ) and our numerical results (  4 ) , and discuss their astrophysical implications (  5 ) .",
    "the appendix contains more details of our numerical method .",
    "for completeness , we briefly review the basic physics of magnetically driven warping / precession and give the formulae to be used in later sections .    the inner region of the accretion disk onto a rotating magnetized central star is subjected to magnetic torques that induce warping and precession of the disk ( lai 1999 ) .",
    "these magnetic torques result from the interactions between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetic field .",
    "depending on how the disk responds to the stellar field , two different kinds of torque arise : ( i ) if the vertical stellar magnetic field @xmath1 penetrates the disk , it gets twisted by the disk rotation to produce an azimuthal field @xmath2 that has different signs above and below the disk ( @xmath3 is the azimuthal pitch of the field line and depends on the dissipation in the disk ) , and a radial surface current @xmath4 results . the interaction between @xmath4 and the stellar @xmath5 gives rise to a vertical force . while the mean force ( averaging over the azimuthal direction ) is zero , the uneven distribution of the force induces a net _ warping torque _ which tends to misalign the angular momentum of the disk with the stellar spin axis .",
    "( ii ) if the disk does not allow the vertical stellar field ( e.g. , the rapidly varying component of @xmath1 due to stellar rotation ) to penetrate , an azimuthal screening current @xmath6 will be induced on the disk .",
    "this @xmath6 interacts with the radial magnetic field @xmath7 and produces a vertical force .",
    "the resulting _ precessional torque _ tends to drive the disk into retrograde precession around the stellar spin axis .    in general , both the magnetic warping torque and the precessional torque are present . for small disk tilt angle @xmath8 ( the angle between the disk normal and the spin axis ) , the precession angular frequency and warping rate at radius @xmath9",
    "are given by ( lai 1999 ) & & _ p ( r)=f ( ) , [ eqn : omega_p ] + & & _ w ( r)=^2 , [ eqn : gamma_w ] where @xmath10 is the stellar magnetic dipole moment , @xmath11 is the angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the spin axis , @xmath12 is the orbital angular frequency , and @xmath13 is the surface density of the disk .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the half - thickness of the disk , and @xmath17 is the inner disk radius , given by the magnetosphere radius @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the stellar mass , @xmath20 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath21 .",
    "the function @xmath22 depends on the dielectric property of the disk . we can write @xmath23 so that @xmath24 if only the spin - variable vertical field is screened out by the disk ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 if all vertical field is screened out ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in reality , @xmath28 lies between 0 and  1 . for concreteness",
    ", we shall set @xmath24 in the following .",
    "in a viscous accretion disk ( with the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath29 ) , the dynamics of the disk warp is dominated by viscous stress ( rather than bending waves ; see papaloizou & lin 1995 ; terquem 1998 ) , and can be studied using the formalism of papaloizou & pringle ( 1983 ) ( see also pringle  1992 ; ogilvie  1999 ; ogilvie & dubus  2001 ) .",
    "we model the disk as a collection of rings which interact with each other via viscous stresses .",
    "each ring at radius @xmath9 has the unit normal vector @xmath30 . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates , with the @xmath31-axis along the stellar spin @xmath32 , we can write @xmath33 with @xmath34 the tilt angle and @xmath35 the twist angle .",
    "the relevant equations are mass conservation , @xmath36 and the evolution equation for @xmath37 , @xmath38{\\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\bf l}}{\\partial r } } = { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial r}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\nu_2{\\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\bf l}}{\\partial r}}\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\nu_2\\left|{\\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\bf l}}{\\partial r}}\\right|^2\\hat{\\bf l } } + \\frac{\\bf n}{\\sigma r^2\\omega}.\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the usual disk velocity ( measuring the @xmath9@xmath40 stress ) , @xmath41 denotes the viscosity in the @xmath9@xmath31 stress which is associated with reducing the disk tilt and @xmath42 represents external torques acting on the disk .",
    "the radial velocity was derived by pringle ( 1992 ) , @xmath43 the nonlinear warp equation ( [ eq : evolution - hatl ] ) is based on a phenomenological description of the viscosities @xmath39 and @xmath41 and is formally valid only in the linear regime when the local disk warp @xmath44 is small ( ogilvie 1999 ) .",
    "a more rigorous treatment by ogilvie ( 1999 ) removes this assumption and finds that @xmath39 and @xmath41 effectively depend on the warp amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "ogilvie ( 1999 ) also finds an additional term causing dispersive propagation and precession .",
    "however , it turns out that this latter term is not very important for keplerian disks . for the current investigation into the qualitative features of the magnetic warping and precession instability we adopt the simpler equations given by pringle ( 1992 ) .",

    "( [ eq : unscaled - n ] ) causes retrograde precession of the tilted disk ( since @xmath50 due to the choice @xmath24 ) , whereas the second term tries to warp the disk .    the magnetic torque formulae [ eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : omega_p ] ) and ( [ eqn : gamma_w ] ) ] contain uncertain parameters ( e.g. , @xmath3 , which parametrizes the amount of azimuthal twist of the magnetic field threading the disk ) ; this is inevitable given the complicated nature of magnetic field  disk interaction ( see lai 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "also , while the expression for the warping torque [ eq .  ( [ eqn : gamma_w ] ) ] is formally valid for large disk warps , the expression for the precession torque was derived under the assumption that the disk is locally flat [ eq .  ( [ eqn : omega_p ] )",
    "is strictly valid only for a completely flat disk ; see aly 1980 ] ; when this assumption breaks down ( i.e. , when @xmath44 is large ) , we expect a similar torque expression to hold , but with modified numerical factors ( e.g. the function @xmath14 in eq .  ( [ eqn : omega_p ] ) will be different ) . when an almost flat disk becomes unstable to the warping instability , and also in the deeply nonlinear warp regime with disk tilted to large radii ( see  4 ) , the condition @xmath51 is well satisfied . thus we believe that our simplifying assumptions capture the qualitative behavior of accretion disks subject to the magnetic torques .",
    "we need boundary conditions for @xmath52 and for the surface density @xmath53 .",
    "the torque  ( [ eq : unscaled - n ] ) decays rapidly with radius , so that we expect the outer disk to be undisturbed .",
    "this is confirmed by the linear stability analysis of shirakawa & lai ( 2002a , b ) .",
    "we therefore adopt simple dirichlet boundary conditions at the outer edge of the disk , @xmath54 throughout this paper we choose @xmath55 , such that the outer disk is perpendicular to the rotation axis of the star . at the inner edge of the disk",

    "[ fig : early_times ] presents the tilt - angle at the inner edge , @xmath98 and the precession frequency at the inner edge , @xmath99 as a function of time @xmath100 .",
    "the disk is indeed unstable and a growing mode emerges . at early times",
    ", the tilt - angle grows exponentially with e - folding time of @xmath101 and precession frequency @xmath102 .",
    "these numbers agree very well with the linear stability analysis of shirakawa & lai ( 2002b ) . at late times",
    "the growth slows down , and the tilt - angle saturates around @xmath103 .",
    "eventually , the disk settles into a solution where the whole disk precesses with uniform precession frequency , i.e. the tilt - angle profile @xmath104 is independent of time , whereas the twist angle increases linearly in time , @xmath105 , with the precession frequency @xmath106 .",
    "[ fig : beta_profiles ] presents the tilt - angle @xmath104 as a function of radius at different times .",
    "one sees clearly that after the mode has saturated , the tilted region of the disk is larger than during the linear phase .",
    "the profiles of the tilt - angle provide an explanation for the reduction of precession frequency as the disk enters the non - linear regime : the precessional torque given by the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , is suppressed by the factor @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , a more extended disk is involved , reducing the precession rate further . in the final steady - state ,",
    "the precession period is @xmath108 , while the warp diffusion time @xmath109 is of order @xmath110 ( in dimensionless units ) .",
    "the disk warp extents to @xmath111 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : beta_profiles ] ) so that @xmath112 .",
    "thus the different parts of the warped disk can communicate with each other through viscous diffusion on a timescale shorter than the precession time , making rigid - body precession possible .",
    "also , both @xmath113 and @xmath109 are much larger than the e - folding time @xmath114 of the growth of linear perturbations .",

    "[ fig : sigma_profiles ] shows the surface density relative to the flat disk , @xmath116 at different times .",
    "as the evolution proceeds , the disk gets depleted .",
    "the reason for this is that as the disk warps , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) gives rise to increased advection relative to the flat disk .",
    "although the disk - tilt is confined to relatively small radii ( e.g. , @xmath117 for @xmath118 ; and @xmath8 decreases exponentially with larger @xmath119 ) , the surface density is depleted over a larger region with the deviation from @xmath120 decreasing only as @xmath121 .",
    "the outer disk depletes on the viscous time - scale of the _ outer _ disk ; this explains the very slow relaxation to the steady - state in fig .",
    "[ fig : early_times ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath122 changes at large radii necessitates the use of a large computational domain , although the disk is only warped in the inner region .",
    "we typically place the outer boundary at @xmath123 , which results in accuracy of about @xmath124 .",
    "the growing mode is only a transient phenomenon  one will most likely observe only the nonlinear steady state solution .",
    "therefore we now study the properties of the steady - state solution as a function of four of the parameters that characterize the system : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath62 and @xmath80 ( for definiteness , the other parameters are fixed as in  4.1 ) .",
    "first we consider the effect of varying @xmath125 ( keeping @xmath90 , @xmath92 and @xmath81 and @xmath74 as in  4.1 ) . for different @xmath125 ,",
    "we perform evolutions until relaxation to steady - state , and then record the tilt angle @xmath127 and the disk precession frequency @xmath128 .",
    "figure [ fig : vary_gammaw ] presents the results of this computation . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the disk is unstable to the magnetic warping instability ( in agreement with the linear stability analysis ) ; with increasing torque @xmath125 , the steady - state tilt - angle @xmath127 increases .",
    "there is only a small window of torque parameters , for which the steady - state disk is moderately warped ( say , @xmath130 ) .",
    "hence , this computation suggests that , whenever the magnetic warping instability operates , it is likely that the inner disk will be significantly tilted .",
    "figure [ fig : vary_gammaw ] also shows the steady - state precession frequency @xmath131 as a function of @xmath125 . at the onset of warping instability ( @xmath132 ) , @xmath133 . as @xmath125 increases",
    ", @xmath134 drops very rapidly : doubling the warping torque decreases @xmath134 by roughly a factor of ten .",
    "the reason is that for larger @xmath125 , the disk tilt is larger ( approaching @xmath135 very closely ) and the warping region is more extended ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_profiles ] ) . note that the surface density of the @xmath136 evolution deviates less from @xmath120 than the one for @xmath91 ; this is because the local disk - warp is smaller in the former case ( @xmath137 as compared with @xmath138 ) , so that less additional advection is introduced by the warping .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath125 opens the possibility to account for a wide variety of low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations with the nonlinear behavior of a warped disk driven by the magnetic warping instability ( see  5 ) .",
    "we now use eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) for the function @xmath77 and extend the parameter searches to @xmath126 , @xmath62 and @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig : other_params ] presents results for different choices of these parameters . for each curve , evolutions were first performed for large @xmath125 until the steady state is reached .",
    "then @xmath125 was gradually lowered so that a sequence of steady - state solutions was traced out .",
    "( when @xmath125 becomes smaller than a certain critical torque , the disks suddenly flattens completely ; see  4.3 . )",
    "several general features of the steady - state disks appear to be robust : in all cases , @xmath131 strongly depends on @xmath125 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath127 becomes significant ( @xmath139 ) for @xmath125 even slightly exceeding the critical value for the onset of the warping instability .",
    "the precession frequency @xmath131 depends strongly on @xmath126 as well , as comparison between the @xmath90 and @xmath140 curves reveals : for the same @xmath125 , changing @xmath126 by a factor of 2.5 results in a change of @xmath131 by about one order of magnitude .",
    "consider now the effect of larger viscosity ratio @xmath141 [ @xmath142 and 50 , corresponding to @xmath143 and @xmath144 in @xmath145 ; see  3.2 ] .",
    "a larger @xmath83 represents a disk more resistive to bending , so that a larger warping torque @xmath125 is required for the magnetic warping instability to operate .",
    "also , @xmath127 approaches @xmath135 more slowly as @xmath125 is increased .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare_profiles_50 ] shows the steady - state disk profiles for the case of @xmath146 .",
    "these differ appreciably from the profiles obtained with @xmath81 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_profiles ] ) : the tilted region of the disk extends to larger radii ( @xmath147 ) for @xmath146 than for @xmath81 ; the disk is also locally flatter ( @xmath148 ) and more depleted ( with @xmath116 being as small as @xmath149 ) .",
    "the inner boundary condition is somewhat critical .",
    "the disk behavior described above works for relatively large @xmath62 ( @xmath150 ; depending on the other parameters ) .",
    "however , reducing @xmath62 further leads to singularities in the disk : for evolutions with smaller @xmath62 , say , @xmath151 , it appears that the surface density tends to zero at some finite radius @xmath152 away from the inner edge .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath8 is non - zero inside @xmath152 and close to zero outside @xmath152 .",
    "overall , it appears that the disk pinches off and two regions remain : a flat outer disk with inner boundary at @xmath152 , and a strongly tilted , rapidly precessing inner disk inside @xmath152 ( which may be viewed as part of the magnetosphere ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : other_params ] , the tilt angle @xmath127 along each curve does not approach zero continuously as @xmath125 is reduced , but exhibits a discontinuity .",
    "a closer examination reveals a hysteretic behavior of warp disks .",
    "consider the @xmath153 case in fig .",
    "[ fig : other_params ] as an example ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : instability_onset ] ) .",
    "if we start with a slightly perturbed disk ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) , then the perturbation decays for @xmath156 and the disk settles down into the flat state . for @xmath125 slightly larger than @xmath157 , the growth rate of the perturbation is proportional to @xmath158 ; nonetheless the perturbation grows to large amplitude ( with @xmath127 reaching @xmath159 in the final steady state ) .",
    "thus , starting from small perturbations , the disk evolves into a steady state which depends discontinuously on @xmath125 ( see the solid line of fig .  [",
    "fig : instability_onset ] ) .",
    "the situation is different if one starts from a highly warped state : we first evolve the disk with @xmath160 until the final ( strongly warped ) steady state is reached .",
    "we then reduce @xmath125 gradually ; for each new value of @xmath125 we evolve the disk to a new steady state ( using the `` previous '' steady - state solution as the initial condition ) .",
    "as long as @xmath161 this procedure produces the same sequence of steady - state disks we found when starting from a slightly perturbed disk .",
    "however , we find that even below @xmath162 , there still exits steady - state warped disks ( see the dashed curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : instability_onset ] ) .",
    "we can follow this sequence down to a second critical value @xmath163 . slightly above @xmath164 ,",
    "the tilt angle depends on @xmath125 as @xmath165 for some constant @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "as we reduce @xmath125 below @xmath164 , this warped steady - state sequence terminates abruptly and the disk relaxes to the flat state .",
    "thus , for @xmath168 , both a flat disk and a warped steady - state disk solution exist .",
    "the steady state for such a disk depends on the history of the disk .",
    "when the disk parameters vary slightly  for example because the accretion rate varies  the disk might switch discontinuously between the two states . as the disk moves across a critical value , a strongly warped disk might suddenly `` turn off '' and become flat , or a flat disk might suddenly become unstable with the warp growing to significant values . since the local disk warp is fairly small at each radius ( the maximum @xmath169 being approximately @xmath170 ) , it seems unlikely that the hysteresis is merely an artifact of the adopted simplifying evolution equations ( see  3 ) .",
    "we find that all parameter sets examined in fig .",
    "[ fig : other_params ] exhibit such a hysteresis ( e.g. , for @xmath171 : @xmath172 ; for @xmath173 : @xmath174 ; for @xmath175 : @xmath176 ; for @xmath177 : @xmath178 ) .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated through numerical simulations that accretion disks around magnetic stars can develop into a warped steady - state in which the disk attains a fixed ( warped ) shape and precesses rigidly .",
    "this work extends our previous ( local and global ) linear analysis of magnetically driven warping and precession of accretion disks .",
    "we find that whenever the magnetic warping instability criterion is satisfied in the linear regime , the inner disk ( close to the magnetosphere boundary ) is likely to be highly warped .",
    "the steady - state precession frequency spans a wide range , depending sensitively on the warping and precession torques ( and hence on the parameters of the system ) .      before drawing any astrophysical conclusion of our work , it is useful to recall some of the limitations of our models .",
    "first , the nonlinear warp equations we adopted in our simulations are based on phenomenological descriptions of viscosities ( see  3 ) .",
    "second , the magnetic torques formulae were derived under several assumptions / ansatz : e.g. , locally flat disk , the use of the free parameter @xmath3 to parametrize the magnetic field twist in quasi - steady state ( see  3 ) . finally , there are intrinsic uncertainties associated with the inner boundary conditions of the disk . in our problem ,",
    "the inner boundary is located at the magnetosphere radius , where the transition between a keplerian disk and a corotating magnetosphere occurs .",
    "the physics that determines this transition is obviously complicated ( see references cited in  1 ) .",
    "the magnetic warping and precession torques are steep functions of radius and are maximal close to the inner disk edge .",
    "therefore the details of our numerical results depend sensitively on the physics at the inner radius of the accretion disk . in our calculations we adopted the simplest inner boundary conditions for the disk .",
    "a more rigorous resolution of this problem will have to involve studying the coupling of the warped disk and the magnetosphere .",
    "given these uncertainties and limitations , we can not be sure whether some of the features we found for the warped disks ( such the hysteresis behavior discussed in  4.3 ) correspond to reality in any way or simply represent artifacts of our models .",
    "nevertheless , our numerical experiments show that the general behaviors of magnetically driven warped disks that we found ( as summarized at the beginning of  5 ) are robust",
    ".      the most important feature of magnetically driven disk warping studied in this paper is that the disk naturally evolves into a steady state which is highly warped near the inner radius ( the magnetosphere boundary ) .",
    "this is in contrast to other warping mechanisms ( e.g. , those due to radiation pressure or irradiation - driven disk wind ) which operate from outside - in .",
    "such a highly warped disk can lead to modulation of the observed radiation flux either by obscuring the central star or by changing the reprocessed disk emission . as mentioned in  1 , there is growing observational evidence for quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) or variabilities in radiation fluxes induced by warped inner disks in various systems , ranging from ysos ( e.g. aa tauri ; see bouvier et al .",
    "1999 ) to x - ray binaries ( e.g. her x-1 : see deeter et al .  1998 ; scott et al .",
    "2000 ; see also shirakawa & lai 2002b for a list of other x - ray binaries showing mhz qpos ) .",
    "another interesting feature of our models is that the disk can be either in a completely flat state ( warping stable ) or in a highly warped state .",
    "thus for a given system , as the disk parameters ( e.g. accretion rate ) vary , the disk can switch abruptly between the two states , leading to the appearance / disappearance of qpos ( with the corresponding change in radiation flux or spectrum ) . indeed , in x - ray binaries , there are many examples where qpos occur only in certain spectral states and not in the others ( e.g. , van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "our calculations showed that the steady - state precession frequency of the disk can be much smaller ( by up to several orders of magnitude , depending on the system parameters , cf .",
    "[ fig : other_params ] ) than the frequency of the linear mode ; the latter was approximately equal to the precession frequency at the disk inner radius ( see shirakawa & lai 2002a , b for typical numbers for x - ray binaries ) .",
    "for magnetized neutron stars ( with surface magnetic field @xmath179  g ) , the global precession frequency is @xmath180 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath181 can be much smaller than unity , and @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , with @xmath185 as well as @xmath186 . for typical parameters appropriate for t tauri stars ,",
    "the precession period is given by @xmath187 where @xmath188  g is the surface magnetic field of the star , @xmath189 is the stellar radius , and @xmath190 .",
    "therefore magnetically driven precession can potentially explain some long - period qpos / variabilities in x - ray binaries and ysos .",
    "it is of interest to note that the magnetically driven precession is retrograde , as observed in some systems ( e.g. , her x-1 ) .    finally , if the outflows from ysos are produced from interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the disk , as in the x - wind models ( shu et al .",
    "1994 ) , then the magnetic effects studied in this paper may be responsible for the jet precession observed in several systems [ see terquem et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ; see also lai ( 2003 ) for possible warping instability in magnetically driven disk outflows ] .",

    "equations  ( [ eq : sigma2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : lhat2 ] ) are essentially of the form @xmath191 with coefficients @xmath192 depending nonlinearly on the variables @xmath122 and @xmath193 ( for ease of notation , we omit the hat on @xmath52 here ) .",
    "we discretize these equations using the crank - nicholson method ( press et al .  1992 ) .",
    "time - derivatives are discretized as usual , for example @xmath194 the index @xmath195 labels the spatial grid - points , unbarred quantities like @xmath196 denote values at the current time @xmath197 ( which are known ) , and barred quantities denote values at the new time @xmath198 which are to be determined .",
    "spatial derivatives are averaged over @xmath197 and @xmath198 , for example @xmath199 here , @xmath200 is computed using the known values at @xmath197 , whereas @xmath201 is a function of the desired values at @xmath198 .",
    "this discretization leads to a nonlinear system of equations , which is solved iteratively : we start with a guess for @xmath122 and @xmath193 at time @xmath198 , which we denote with tildes , @xmath202 .",
    "based on these guesses , we compute coefficients @xmath203 .",
    "now , we discretize spatial derivatives like ( [ eq : spatial - difference1 ] ) using @xmath204 instead of @xmath201 : @xmath205 substituting these difference expressions into eqs .",

    "improved values @xmath208 for the variables at the next time step which are used in place of @xmath209 .",
    "we iterate this process until convergence .",
    "this scheme is computationally more expensive per time - step than an explicit method .",
    "however , it is second order accurate in time and unconditionally stable , so that one can take very large time - steps . in practice",
    ", we often exceed courant - factors of 1000 .",
    "these large time - steps are especially important during the slow relaxation toward a coherently rotating steady - state disk .",
    "in such a case , one is primarily interested in the time - independent final state , whereas the transient evolution toward this state is less important .",
    "the code uses an adaptive time step : @xmath210 is adjusted such that the difference in solution at @xmath197 and @xmath198 is smaller than some threshold , typically @xmath211 .",
    "furthermore , the code can be used with different radial distributions of grid points , for example linearly or logarithmically spaced grid points .",
    "this is done via a mapping @xmath212 , which relates a `` computational '' coordinate @xmath213 ( in which the grid is uniform ) to the `` physical '' radial coordinate @xmath119 . rewriting `` physical '' derivatives in terms of the computational coordinate @xmath213 , @xmath214 shows that the coefficients @xmath215 will be modified by this mapping , however , the principal structure of eqs .",
