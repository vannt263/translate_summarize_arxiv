    "mechanical systems of kinematically coupled structures , or multibody systems , have a variety of engineering applications including robotic manipulators , manufacturing machines with articulated components , bipedal walking and musculoskeletal system modeling @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of such systems is how they behave when certain degrees of freedom are left unactuated . in dealing with such underactuated mechanical systems ,",
    "we often explore their fundamental properties .",
    "for instance , if the unactuated variables are cyclic ( i.e. do not appear in the lagrangian ) , then the momentum map associated with these variables will be conserved due to symmetry @xcite .",
    "one of the most celebrated examples of the symmetry and conservation of momentum is the falling cat problem @xcite : a cat always lands on its feet after released upside down from rest , by deforming its body while keeping a zero angular momentum .",
    "there are variants of the falling cat such as elroy s beanie @xcite and springboard divers @xcite .",
    "another popular example is the system of a human sitting on a rotating stool holding a wheel @xcite .",
    "sitting on the rotating stool , one spins the wheel by his hand while holding it horizontally .",
    "a reaction torque will be created and initiate the rotating motion of the stool in the opposite direction . as long as the wheel is rotating",
    ", the stool keeps rotating . after some time , if the person applies a braking force halting the wheel spin , then the stool will also stop .",
    "all of these phenomena follow from angular momentum conservation , which holds in the absence of external forces .",
    "if there is an external force , then the momentum is not conserved any longer in general and the consequent motion of the system will be different from that in the case of momentum conservation .",
    "we are here mainly interested in the case where the external forces are linear in the velocity , i.e. viscous damping - like forces .",
    "this was well studied in @xcite for the case of one - dimensional symmetry , i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 symmetry . according to @xcite , in the stool - wheel system with viscous damping friction on the rotation axis of the stool",
    ", the stool does not keep rotating but meets a bound in its motion even if the person on the stool keeps spinning the wheel .",
    "the larger the angular velocity of the spin of the wheel is , the more angle the stool rotates by , but in the end the stool meets a bound in its motion , not being able to keep rotating , as long as the angular velocity of the wheel is bounded .",
    "this bound on the motion of the stool is called the damping - induced bound .",
    "another phenomenon , which is perhaps more remarkable , in this stool - wheel system with the friction is the following .",
    "after some time , if the person on the stool stops the spinning of the wheel , then the stool does not stop .",
    "instead , it asymptotically converges back to its initial position , making the same number of net rotations in the opposite direction .",
    "this phenomenon is called damping - induced self - recovery . from this example",
    ", one can see that the viscous damping - like force plays a role of a restoring force , but it is different from the spring force . to the knowledge of the authors , an example of damping - induced self - recovery and boundedness",
    "was first reported by andy ruina at a conference @xcite , where he shows a video of his experiment and provides an intuitive proof of the phenomena .",
    "the damping - induced self - recovery phenomenon , without damping - induced boundedness , is also explained in @xcite for the case where the damping coefficient is constant , but the proof therein is not complete .",
    "both phenomena of damping - induced self - recovery and damping - induced boundedness were rigorously and completely proved for the first time in @xcite , where the damping coefficient is allowed to be a function of the cyclic variable and may take some negative values .",
    "the results in @xcite as well as @xcite are for the case of one - dimensional symmetry .",
    "this paper generalizes the results in @xcite to the case of higher - dimensional abelian symmetry .",
    "we consider mechanical systems with several unactuated cyclic variables that are subject to external forces linear in the velocity .",
    "the systems are allowed to have some actuated variables that are subject to control forces .",
    "we find conditions on the linear forces under which the damping - induced phenomena of self - recovery and boundedness occur for the cyclic variables .",
    "the analytical approach taken in this paper for the proof of these two phenomena is different from that in @xcite .",
    "the total order of @xmath2 was implicitly made use of in @xcite , but in this paper we employ a lyapunov - like function to prove the damping - induced self - recovery and boundedness for the multiple cyclic variables .",
    "we first characterize a class of damping - like forces that induce new conserved quantities which we call in this paper the damping - added momenta , and then construct a lyapunov - like function using the damping - added momenta to prove the existence of the phenomena of damping - induced self - recovery and boundedness . to illustrate the main results , we consider two nontrivial examples of multibody systems that possess multiple cyclic variables : the planar pendulum with gimbal actuators and the three - link planar manipulator on a horizontal plane .",
