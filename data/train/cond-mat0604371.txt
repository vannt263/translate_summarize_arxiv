    "one of the most impressive experiments using trapped bose gases is the interference experiment of ketterle and co - workers.@xcite two condensates are are separately prepared and allowed to overlap .",
    "an interference pattern then arises showing the remarkable quantum coherence of the condensates .",
    "there have been other interesting condensate interference experiments as well.@xcite@xmath0@xcite if one assumes that the separated clouds initially have a definite phase relation , then the experiments are well - described by straight - forward theory.@xcite however , questions immediately arise .",
    "do separately prepared condensates have a phase relation?@xcite the preparation of the sample certainly did not involve the establishment of a state with known phase .",
    "more likely the particle number in each cloud would have , or could have , been initially known ahead of time .",
    "nevertheless an interference pattern emerges with some well - established phase .",
    "so how is this possible ?",
    "the question was answered in several theoretical papers showing how a phase appears even when the two clouds are prepared in fock states , that is , states with sharply known particle numbers.@xcite@xmath0@xcite in this paper we revisit the question and present a derivation of this result .",
    "this result is quite satisfying , since it in a sense justifies the usual simple assumption of the interferring coherent systems having a well - defined , but completely unknown , initial phase relationship .    in order to discuss the properties of condensates and superfluids",
    "one usually introduces theoretically a so - called `` order parameter '' or `` condensate wave function '' defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an operator destroying a particle at position @xmath3 the resulting quantity has a magnitude equal to the square root of the condensate density and also a phase . obviously the state in which @xmath1 is non - zero",
    "can not have a fixed particle number .",
    "with one of these wave functions for each condensate , it is straightforward to discuss interference of the two , since each one has its own phase , and an interference pattern arises with a relative phase equal to the difference between the individual phases .",
    "in essence one has described each condensate by a single - particle wave function so that interference is no more than the overlap and interference of two classical waves .",
    "however , one can ask how this single - particle wave function might have arisen .",
    "indeed its existence involves the question of `` spontaneously broken gauge symmetry''@xcite@xmath4@xcite , the necessity of which has been brought into question in recent years.@xcite@xmath0@xcite    suppose we consider a condensate described by a wave function @xmath5 one might describe the direction specified by the angle @xmath6 by a `` spin '' in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "how do we prepare such a state ?",
    "what is it that picks out the direction of this pseudo - spin from the all the degenerate possible directions ?",
    "there is an analogy with ferromagnetism , where there is symmetry in the possible degenerate three - dimensional directions of the magnetization .",
    "somehow , say , because of a small external field , a particuliar direction is space is picked out for the magnetization . in a similar way the phase angle is picked out .",
    "one can suppose in the ferromagnetism case that , in actual practice , there is always some small field to pick out a preferred direction , so that the symmetry is broken .",
    "however , the local field that is used theoretically to pick a phase direction does not exist in nature .",
    "indeed one would have to prepare a state that does not have a fixed particle number .",
    "the treatment of phase ( actually relative phase ) in sec .",
    "iv , and the spontaneous appearance of a relative phase under the effect of measurement of particle position in fock states , avoids violating particle conservation and does not require use of any symmetry - breaking field and so helps in this regard .    a closely related feature of the discussion is the idea that the phase emerging from successive measurements of particle position starting with a fock state is somewhat like the emergence of a `` hidden '' or `` additional '' variable in quantum mechanics.@xcite@xmath7@xcite@xmath7@xcite was the phase there before the experiment started , or did the experiment itself cause it to take on its final value ?",
    "hidden variables can be invoked to specify non - commuting variables . in standard",
    "quantum mechanics , particle number and relative phase can be considered conjugate variables ; the knowledge of one excludes that of the other . as we measure particle position we will see that the knowledge of the particle number becomes less certain while the uncertainty of relative phase decreases .    in the next sections we first discuss the kind of state that has a known phase .",
    "obviously with this state the interference pattern emerges with just the prepared phase . among these states",
    "are are the coherent states of glauber.@xcite these can either have particle number completely unknown or have the total number of particles in two clouds known ( in which case they are called `` phase states '' ) , although the number in each cloud is still unknown .",
    "we then derive the interference pattern starting with fock states and see the emergence of a relative phase even though no phase was present at the beginning of the experiment ( or was at least `` hidden '' ) .",
    "we even find a way to prepare a state that has a known relative phase .",
    "the controversal theoretical constructs are seen to be unnecessary .",
    "a gas ( or liquid ) undergoing bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is often described by a classical field known as an `` order parameter '' or `` condensate wave function . ''",
    "such a quantity can arise in several ways .",

    "one often assumes the system in a state such that the destruction operator itself has a non - zero average : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the condensate density and @xmath16 its phase .",
    "such a state is said to have `` spontaneously broken gauge symmetry '' because a particular phase ( out of many possible degenerate phase states ) has been chosen.@xcite@xmath0 @xcite the gross - pitaevskii equation is a non - linear schrodinger equation for @xmath17 which has been used extensively , with remarkable success , to describe interacting trapped bec gases within mean - field approximation.@xcite    in describing the interference pattern of the experiment of ref .",
    "one has to consider the overlap of bose clouds released from harmonic oscillator traps.@xcite this leads to some interesting features such as fringes whose separation changes with time . in our analysis here",
    "we will consider only plane waves and ignore any time evolution .",

    "how we might actually prepare one _ before _ the experiment is a separate difficult question , which we treat below",
    ".    we will find it useful and necessary in the next section to consider more general cases in which we make measurements of many particle positions essentially simultaneously .",
    "this allows interference fringes to emerge where they would otherwise not occur . for our phase state",
    "such calculations are straightforward and add no additional information since the the multiparticle densities all factor in the phase states .",

    "it seems likely , in any case , that one has more chance of initially preparing such a state .",
    "however , as several workers@xcite@xmath0@xcite have realized in recent years , and as we will show , that an interference pattern with some phase can still arise in a fock state . denoting the state sharp in particle number as @xmath90 and using the bose annihilation relation",
    "@xmath91 the one - body density in a fock state is @xmath92 and of course there is no interference . phase and particle number are conjugates , and the particle number is initially known .    however ,",

    "we have shown how one might rigorously treat the interference of two bose condensates .",
    "the usual assumption of two condensates with individually known phases gets involved with the thorny questions about whether one can usefully define the phase of a single condensate . however , using such states does lead directly to the usual fomulas for interference patterns based on very simple assumptions .",
    "this procedure remains unsatisfying since it may not be very obvious to the experimenter how to prepare such phase states before looking at the interference .",

    "the existence of a field that would make @xmath161 non - zero is not so clear , since such states do not conserve particle number .",
    "the existence of a well - defined relative phase established by measuring particle positions can be established without worrying about broken symmetry .",
