    "this paper will try to address the following question : to what extent is it possible to take the elements of currently - accepted theories that are experimentally verified and combine them to produce real , consistent physics ?",
    "this assumes proceeding with the minimum possible usage of speculative higher symmetries and groups , dimensions , new particles , and fields .",
    "the idea is to combine existing elements in ways compatible with quantum field theory and general relativity to the extent that this is possible .",
    "some key practices include : working with known symmetries and groups such as u(1 ) , su(2 ) , su(3 ) , and so(3 ) , working with four or 3 + 1 dimensions so that a cross product is possible , working with a holomorphic , analytic - continuation representation , working with classical concepts such as phase and configuration space trajectories ( paths ) and world lines , and not assuming any new particle or field content .",
    "it must be acknowledged that , currently , any composition of the key elements of accepted theories is , in a real sense , speculative in its own right .      it is already known that phase trajectories ( also known as phase paths ) and world lines are concepts that are compatible with each other@xcite .",
    "the paths ( or orbits or trajectories ) of particles in space - time , their phase or configuration space paths , and world lines are different representations or aspects of the same thing .",
    "these can also be understood using the concepts of symmetry group ( gauge ) transformations and orbits .",
    "another type of fundamental representation that is essential is field representations such as probability wave function representations .",
    "these and their associated machinery such as lagrangians and hamiltonians are all complementary methods that express and manage different aspects or facets of what is being studied .    some other aspects that are important to consider are whether the representations are local or global , and whether the underlying representation ( metric ) is considered to be flat or curved .",
    "analytic - continuation representations and wick rotations also provide means of representing and working with different aspects .",
    "the most realistic approach is to combine the usage of different methods and representations in ways that allow the different aspects to be handled best .    to have the best chance of fitting different elements of current theories together",
    ", a generalized analysis will be given .",
    "the local representations will be setup to maintain consistency with current theories .",
    "the relationships required by current theories will then be imposed .",
    "this allows for the best consistency with current theories while allowing for any implicit relationships between current theories to become manifest .",
    "compatibility with the currently - accepted theories will provide constraint and validation for the development of the synthesis and analysis .",
    "the compatibility of phase paths with quantum field theory , when used carefully , will be used as the basis for maintaining compatibility with both quantum field theory and general relativity .",
    "analytic - continuation representations and ashtekar s new variables @xcite will also be assumed to help form a common basis between quantum field theory and general relativity . in the interest of brevity ,",
    "the statement of the ties to currently - accepted theories will be restricted to the minimum necessary to constrain the analysis and validate compatibility .",
    "the approach this paper will use will be to treat paths , orbits , trajectories , and world - lines of the various sorts such as phase , configuration , space - time , field , gauge group , or relativistic as similar entities whose representations capture the differences in the facets or aspects of the different entities .",
    "to this end , a synthesis that abstracts the treatment of `` paths '' and their `` representations '' will be done .",
    "the probability relations ( functions and functionals ) for these entities are also an important aspect or facet",
    ".    this approach starts by considering numbers to be capable of being decomposed into two `` dual '' parts  each part being tangent and cotangent four - dimensional representations .",
    "the next step is to consider merging these numbers together to create extended objects  but preferring that the numbers be put together only if their representations merge together smoothly and continuously .",
    "these ( complex ) numbers are identifiable as system points and their extended objects as paths .",
    "the local representations are constructed as symmetric , holomorphic , analytic - continuation representations so that either representation can be a foreground or background representation .",
    "this allows full foreground and background ( self ) interaction to be present .",
    "the smooth merging of the paths and their local chart representations allows these local charts to be `` glued '' together to form a global manifold solution@xcite .",
    "the global manifold solution is a background representation that does not participate in the local foreground and background symmetry .",
    "the global manifold solution is given as a restriction of the holomorphic , analytic - continuation ( symmetric ) representation .",
    "permutations of the possible paths , the possible representations for the paths , and combinations and transitions of the representations constitute an initial local superset realm@xcite .",
    "not all of this realm can be effectively realized as ( directly ) observable solutions .",
    "we will follow the convention of calling the observable entities `` effective '' entities .",
    "other entities we will call either `` initial '' or `` local '' entities . we assume initial entities have only local structure while effective entities have both local and global structure .    for full foreground and background symmetry , holomorphic , analytic - continuation representations for the paths are introduced .",
    "explicit mappings between the conjugate representations is given .",
    "local representation quantities are expressed conjugate to each other at each point but the physical hilbert structure is only imposed on the effective representation@xcite and is not considered in this paper .",
    "local interactions within and between these representations are explored .",
    "these representations are then mapped ( restricted ) to a target space - time manifold solution .",
    "when the combinatorial sum composition is taken , some global solutions have the possibility of separating so that they have no direct coupling to the local interactions .",
    "most other global solutions do not have the local interaction coupling eliminated .",
    "the coupled remainder for the local interactions leads to what may be identified as mass terms .",
    "the particles have local interaction terms that couple to the mass unless they are capable of the cancellations necessary to decouple and to become independent of any mass terms ( or other local coupled terms ) .",
    "we will not follow the convention of setting @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc .",
    "it is also part of the purpose of this paper to track the origin and combinations of the fundamental constants .",
    "that is easier to do when they are explicit in the equations .",
    "the range ( dimensionality ) of indexes will be specified in the paper when it is appropriate to assume a restricted range , except that the indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 are assumed to run from one to three .",
    "an essential ingredient in the mathematics for physics is the combination of entities that produce a ( possibly complex ) number or numeric ( scalar ) field as a result .",
    "the general form in mathematics is to map two entities to a number .",
    "the map of vectors @xmath5 and differential forms @xmath6 to ( possibly complex ) numbers @xmath7 , @xmath8 , will be the basic form considered here .",
    "the remainder of this section will state some general machinery for considering `` paths '' .    to analyze paths , start with an unordered set of complex numbers that does not contain zero : @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    ". please do not yet think of these numbers @xmath7 as points as there is not yet an associated space or manifold .",
    "consider different permutated subsets of the values in the set @xmath7 of @xmath11 , in which @xmath12 .",
    "define these ( range ) subsets as the images of different functions @xmath13 .",
    "define the functional that is constructed by using a domain set consisting of all functions whose ( range ) images @xmath14 are all the possible permutations of ( domain ) subsets of @xmath7 @xmath15 = \\{\\lambda(\\omega)~|~\\\\   \\forall z , \\forall \\lambda , z = \\lambda(\\omega ) ,",
    "\\\\   z \\in \\lambda\\}.\\ ] ] the @xmath13 are then defined as path functions whose values are the complex numbers @xmath16 in some permutation .",
    "there is not _ a priori _ a requirement for the values along a path @xmath13 to be smooth or continuous  in the general case , they could jump around in any order and be discontinuous .",
    "the path element @xmath17 is a discrete numerical representation .",
    "the differential form @xmath18 represents an infinitesimal ( continuous ) piece of numeric path . for ease of notation ,",
    "represent both @xmath17 and @xmath18 by @xmath18 and create a path @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is some different arrangement of the @xmath14 .",
    "as defined so far , these paths are possibly very chaotic  allowing continuous and discrete changes along the path and different and incompatible representations of elements along the path . in the general case , the different representation spaces for each path element could include changes in scale , orientation , dimension , and structure such as algebra and groups .",
    "giving quantum field theory preeminent place , the probability representation for a path will be considered to be a primary representation . the problem of foreground and background representation interaction will next be explicitly addressed .",
    "differential form representations are considered next in importance with their particular representations constrained or validated by compatibility with current theory .      for probability representations it is important to define probability amplitude functions and functionals .",
    "define @xmath21 $ ] as a functional whose domain is the set of functions that assigns complex probability amplitude images ( the function s range ) to each path @xmath14 ( the function s domain ) :",
    "@xmath22 = \\{\\phi(\\lambda)~|~\\forall c , c = \\phi(\\lambda ) , c \\in \\mathbb{c}\\}.\\ ] ] allow the value of the probability amplitude to be everywhere zero for particular paths @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , some particular paths will be so pathological that they do not effectively exist .",
    "a key problem to address explicitly up - front is the problem of foreground and background definitions and their interactions .",
    "the goal is to try to treat the foreground and background representations equally and symmetrically .",
    "we will start as usual with local definitions called coordinate patches or charts@xcite .",
    "define @xmath5 as the foreground component .",
    "define @xmath23 in differential form as the background representation that has the conjugate coordinate basis @xmath24 .",
    "these definitions are such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability amplitude wave function of the entity that is to be represented .",
    "now consider allowing a portion @xmath28 of the foreground @xmath29 to act on the background representation @xmath30 write @xmath28 in differential form @xmath31 and write a combined holomorphic , analytic - continuation representation using the conjugate of @xmath32 @xmath33 the use of a dimensional constant @xmath34 , placing , the @xmath35 representation on the imaginary axis , and/or usage of a group vector @xmath36 can be important to make sure that there is not inappropriate mixing of terms . if it is appropriate , then @xmath34 and @xmath36 can be set to one .",
    "another way of viewing this is that the `` foreground '' definition is a representation in its own right and to treat it symmetrically@xcite . to this end ,",
    "two local representations , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , will be introduced in which one can be thought of as a local foreground definition and the other as a local background definition  but with nothing ( yet ) selecting which one is which .",
    "this type of formulation allows us to try to simultaneously fit both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 representations to smooth transitions . in the case",
    "that @xmath39 is a spatial coordinate , then included in @xmath40 are conjugate momentum terms that correspond to translational transformations of @xmath39 and conjugate angular momentum terms that correspond to rotational transformations of @xmath39 .",
    "this program of extending the representations corresponds to a program of embedding the possible transformations of a representation into a larger , extended representation .",
    "the internal and external transformations will also be embedded into extended representations with ( gauge ) fields providing a mapping restriction back to a restricted representation .",
    "write a holomorphic , analytic - continuation representation in terms of coordinate patch bases    @xmath41    or @xmath42    quantum conditions can be assumed by excluding a region of the complex plane ( which could be located at the origin ) .",
    "if an area of a particular size @xmath43 is excluded from the complex plane , then the quantum condition @xmath44 has been applied ( no summation on @xmath45these are separate conditions ) . for classical conditions ,",
    "either take the limit as @xmath46 goes to zero or scale up to a scale very much larger than @xmath46 so that @xmath46 1is effectively negligible ( zero ) .    to highlight the key differences from the usual definitions , start by considering a standard definition of a bundle @xmath47 with manifold @xmath48 , fiber @xmath49 , and group @xmath50 .",
    "next we see that for local , full symmetry we want a `` bundle '' with fibers @xmath51 and @xmath52not the usual definition of a bundle . in the case that foreground and background symmetry",
    "is ignored , then @xmath51 may be mapped to a ( global ) manifold @xmath48 and a standard bundle @xmath47 results .",
    "this subsection states some properties of transformations and gauge field representations of holomorphic representations@xcite",
    ". please consider external ( group ) transformations @xmath53 operating on the representation @xmath54 these correspond to the internal ( conjugate ) transformations that transform between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    ".    defining the `` momentum '' ( gauge field ) representation that is conjugate to the external transformations @xmath61 representation as @xmath65 gives another form of representation @xmath66      the preceding representations are local definitions .",

    ", a preferred background representation will have to be identified and ( summed combination ) transition functions and operations will have to be identified and used .",
    "the global representation is a ( restriction ) subset of the degrees of freedom and interactions that can be present locally .",
    "when going from local to global representations , some local ( internal ) symmetries or group transformations may show closure  the group orbits within their phase or configuration volumes may be shrunk to `` points '' from a global perspective .",
    "the local interactions become hidden and some part of the system acts as a composite single entity .",
    "this means that not all quantities that are present locally are quantities that must be representable directly on the global representation  especially with full foreground and background interaction symmetry .",
    "these local representations can be written as a composite representation term @xmath67 that couples to the global space - time representation .",
