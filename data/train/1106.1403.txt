    "the properties exhibited by these nanostructures are strongly dependent on the geometry , and therefore understanding the effect of the shape is fundamental for the development of applications of such materials@xcite .",
    "the magnetization of nanodots may reverse by one of two possible mechanisms : vortex nucleation and coherent rotation@xcite .",
    "vortex states are characterized by an in - plane and an out - of - plane magnetization .",
    "the in - plane magnetization is characterized by vortex chirality , defined as the magnetization direction around the vortex core ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) .",
    "the out - of - plane magnetization is defined by the vortex core or polarity . in this way , vortices exhibit four different magnetic states defined by their polarity and chirality .    methods to control the chirality in single fm layer elements exploit an asymmetry in the applied field , such as produced by a magnetic force microscope tip @xcite , a magnetic pulse @xcite , a magnetic field gradient @xcite , or the magnetization history klaui .",

    "the effect of geometry on the vortex nucleation , annihilation and switching field distribution was explored in 40-nm - thick ni@xmath4fe@xmath5 disk arrays , with a diameter of 300 nm and different degrees of asymmetry@xcite .",
    "these measurements and micromagnetic simulations showed that the nucleation and annihilation of vortices vary linearly , while the switching field distribution oscillates with the ratio of the long / short asymmetry axes .",
    "more recently , studies of arrays of asymmetric co dots showed that the vortices can be manipulated to annihilate at particular sites under specific field orientations and cycling sequences.@xcite    in this paper , monte carlo simulations are used to study the magnetic configurations and reversal processes of asymmetric dots as a function of their geometry .",
    "the behavior of the chirality , coercive field and remanent magnetization is studied for non - interacting asymmetric dots as a function of their aspect ratio .",
    "our results show that the asymmetry determines the region where vortex nucleation occurs , fixing the chirality of the vortex .",
    "our starting point is a uniform circular dot with diameter @xmath6 nm and height @xmath7 nm .",
    "we introduce asymmetries in these dots by cutting specific sections characterized by a parameter @xmath8 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the field is applied in - plane along the asymmetry direction .        a symmetric dot",

    "the internal energy , @xmath11 , of a single dot with @xmath12 magnetic moments is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the dipolar energy given by    @xmath15 /r_{ij}^{3}\\ , , \\label{eq : edip}\\ ] ]    with @xmath16 the distance between the magnetic moments @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 the unit vector along the direction that connects the two magnetic moments .",
    "@xmath20 is the exchange coupling , which is assumed nonzero only for nearest neighbors and @xmath21 is a unit vector along the direction of @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 represents the zeeman energy for a field  @xmath24  applied along the x direction .",
    "as we are interested in polycrystalline samples , we have not included anisotropy .",
    "simulation of the magnetic configuration of 10 - 100 nm structures is not possible at present with standard computational facilities due to the large number of magnetic moments within each particle . to avoid this problem",
    "we use a scaling technique developed earlier , @xcite for the calculation of the phase diagram of cylindrical particles . in this approach",
    "we define a scaling factor @xmath25 ( 0.01 - 0.001 ) , small enough to reduce the system to a computationally manageable size while still large enough to conserve its physical complexity , i.e. , for instance the possibility for the development of a magnetic vortex . with this ,",
    "physically reasonable results are obtained , in agreement with micromagnetic calculations , as long as the exchange constant is rescaled by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with @xmath29 . in particular for cylinders ,",
    "this method allows rescaling geometric parameters ( height , h , and diameter , d , for instance ) without loosing physically meaningful results for the phase diagram and for the general magnetic state of a single nanoparticle . @xcite thus using this method the geometric parameters are rescaled as @xmath30 and @xmath31    for our simulations we use the same parameters used earlier , mejia , mejia2 which produced for symmetric fe dots good agreement between simulations and experimental measurements .",
    "these parameters are the magnetic moment @xmath32 @xmath33 , with @xmath33 the bohr magneton , bcc lattice constant @xmath34 nm , and @xmath35mev . for the dot sizes considered in this paper",
    ", @xmath12 would be larger than @xmath36 , which is computationally unmanageable .",
    "thus we replace the dot with a smaller one according to the scaling technique described above .",
    "correspondingly , we also scale the exchange interaction by a factor @xmath370.00245 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we replace @xmath38 with @xmath39 mev in the expression for the total energy . in this case @xmath40 and @xmath41 nm .    the monte carlo simulations are carried out using the metropolis algorithm with local dynamics and single - spin flip methods@xcite . the new orientation of the magnetic moment is chosen randomly with a probability @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 is the change in energy due to the reorientation of the spin , @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath45 = @xmath46 and @xmath47 k.    the initial state of the system is set up using a random number generator which is used to randomly choose the spin sequence and their individual orientations .",
    "a large magnetic field of @xmath48 koe is applied along the [ 100 ] crystallographic direction , labeled as the @xmath25 axis .",
    "this produces a configuration in which the system is saturated and therefore most of the magnetic moments point along this direction .",
    "we define @xmath49 as the magnetization at the maximum applied field ( @xmath50 koe ) , @xmath2 as the remanent magnetization and @xmath1 as the coercivity .",
    "field steps of @xmath51 koe are used in all calculations , that is 110 @xmath52 values for the complete hysteresis cycle .",
    "it is important to recognize that , due to the non - equilibrium situation , the number of monte carlo steps ( mcs ) used is a critical issue in the calculation of the hysteresis loops .",
    "hence , we first study the effect of the mcs on the coercivity .",
    "figure 2 illustrates @xmath1 for a symmetric dot as a function of mcs .",
    "@xmath53 converges asymptotically to 0.47 after 4000 mcs per field value .",
    "however , the effects discussed here are qualitatively similar above mcs @xmath54",
    ". therefore we fix the number of monte carlo steps for each field at this value , performing typically @xmath55 monte carlo steps per spin for a complete hysteresis loop .",
    "these numbers are independent of the scaling factor , as discussed in ref . 21 . for each calculation",
    "six hysteresis loops , with different random number seeds , are averaged to obtain the results presented here .    , of a symmetric dot for different numbers of monte carlo steps , mcs.,width=302 ]",
    "the main aim of this work is to investigate the effect of the disk shape asymmetry on the magnetization reversal process .",
    "3 shows a strong geometry dependence of the hysteresis curves for different @xmath3 . for @xmath56",
    "a neck appears with implies that the reversal occurs by means of the nucleation and propagation of a vortex .",
    "further decrease of @xmath57 leads to almost square loops and the coercivity and remanence change as a function of @xmath3 , as shown for @xmath7 and @xmath58 nm in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , respectively .",
    "even a small asymmetry , ( @xmath59 ) , induces an abrupt decrease of both the coercivity and remanence .",
    "however , further decreases of @xmath3 produces an increase in the remanence and coercivity .",
    "this is a consequence of the competition between exchange , local dipolar interactions and geometry .",
    "the magnetic moments produced on the new surface experience a lower exchange interaction facilitating the formation of a c state .",
    "moreover as expected from the pole avoidance principle  aharoni , a c state nucleates to avoid the magnetic pole at the new surface .",
    "the c state , which is the precursor of a vortex , decreases the coercivity . however , further increase of the asymmetry competes with the local effects described above , tending to inhibit vortex formation .",
    "therefore the dependence of the coercivity with @xmath3 is non monotonic .     for height @xmath7 nm ( a ) and @xmath60 nm ( b ) . for @xmath61 the uniform circular",
    "dot has a diameter of @xmath6 nm.,width=302 ]     for height @xmath7 nm ( dots ) and @xmath60 nm ( triangles ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    the surprising large quantitative difference between the @xmath7 nm and @xmath60 nm sample in fig 4(b ) is due to the full collapse of the coercivity and the vertical change in magnetization as a function of the field , as expected from the formation of a vortex .",
    "we analyze the reversal mechanisms from snapshots of the spin configurations for different values of @xmath3 and the applied magnetic field . figs .",
    "5 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show snapshots at particular field values for @xmath7 nm and @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these snapshots show that all the dots reverse their magnetization via vortex nucleation and propagation , even the dots with @xmath65 , which exhibit almost square hysteresis loops . in symmetric dots ,",
    "square loops are a sign of coherent reversal , and the appearance of a neck indicates that the reversal is driven by a vortex nucleation and propagation@xcite .",
    "however for asymmetric dots reversal by vortex nucleation may lead to a square loop .",
    "nm at four different values of @xmath66 .",
    "the points depict the position of the magnetic atoms , while the arrows illustrate the direction of the magnetic moments for @xmath9 ( a ) , @xmath63 ( b ) and 0.1 ( c ) . for ( a )",
    "the vortex propagates from the @xmath67 to + @xmath68 direction with a clock - wise chirality while for ( b ) and ( c ) the vortex propagates from the @xmath69 to -@xmath68 direction with a counterclock - wise chirality.,width=302 ]    for @xmath9 the vortex can nucleate either at the upper or lower portion of the dot , depending of the seed used in the simulation . for instance fig .",
    "5(a ) shows the propagation of a vortex which nucleates at the @xmath70 region , while for other seeds nucleation may occur at the opposite region . however , for @xmath71 ( figs .",
    "5(b ) and ( c ) ) the nucleation occurs always at the @xmath72 region ( the asymmetric part ) , determining uniquely the chirality , @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "this shows that the asymmetry controls the position of vortex nucleation during reversal whereas the vortex chirality is determined by the external magnetic field direction . in high magnetic fields ,",
    "all spins are aligned along the applied field . for asymmetric dots",
    "the reversal proceeds as follows .",
    "as the field is reduced at a particular negative field a vortex nucleates with a counterclock - wise direction as viewed from the top ( fig .",
    "the reversal starting from saturation in a negative field proceeds in the opposite way .",
    "a qualitatively similar behavior occurs for @xmath60 nm .",
    "these results are in good agreement with our independent oommf simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate the shape of the vortex as a function of the dot geometry . to characterize the vortex",
    "we define @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the @xmath25 and @xmath77 components of individual magnetic moments , and @xmath78 ranges over all dots . in this way",
    ", @xmath79 represents a perfect vortex , while deviations from this state are represented by @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , @xmath81 represents a fully saturated ferromagnetic state .",
    "as @xmath82 varies from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , a loop appears and its width represents the stability of the vortex .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath85 for different @xmath3 .    in all cases",
    "the vortex is almost perfect , @xmath86 , at some value of the external field . at this value",
    "the magnetization is zero and therefore represents the coercive field .",
    "this value varies with the geometry of the dot , but also the geometry influences the stability of the c state and the vortex . in particular , for @xmath9",
    "the magnetization reverses by vortex nucleation at a low field value , @xmath87 koe .",
    "the abrupt transition of @xmath85 from 1 to zero is a consequence of the fast propagation of the vortex to the center of the dot .",
    "this state is very stable , as shown by the @xmath88 koe field required for vortex annihilation .",
    "this feature is represented in fig .",
    "6(a ) by the continuum transition of @xmath85 from 0 to approximately 0.3 . for @xmath89 nucleation of a c - state occurs first at @xmath90 koe , represented in fig .",
    "6(b ) by the decrease of @xmath85 from 1 to approximately 0.6 . then , a vortex nucleates at @xmath91 koe , which annihilates at @xmath92 koe , after which a c - state appears again , ending the magnetization reversal .",
    "this figure together with the snapshots in fig .",
    "5 confirms that a small cut is required for the creation and stabilization of a c - state .",
    "the results for @xmath93 are qualitatively similar to those for @xmath94 , although the c - state is more stable , as evidenced by the slow decrease of @xmath85 from 1 to approximately 0.5 , until the vortex appears . during this reversal",
    "the vortex nucleates at @xmath95 koe and annihilates at @xmath96 koe .",
    "finally , for @xmath97 the c - state is even more stable .",
    "the vortex nucleates at @xmath98 koe and annihilates at @xmath99 koe .",
    "thus , the coercivities increase , the c states become more stable , and the vortices become less stable with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , the degree to which the @xmath2 decreases depends critically on the height of the dot .     of the left ( thick lines ) and",
    "right ( thin lines ) branches of the hysteresis curves as a function of the external magnetic field , for a ) @xmath100 b ) @xmath101 c ) @xmath102 and d ) @xmath97.,width=302 ]",
    "the results presented above show that the asymmetry determines the region of vortex nucleation and its chirality during magnetization reversal . the coercivity , remanence , and vortex stability are strongly affected by the asymmetry , with a non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous experimental evidence @xcite which explored the relation between asymmetry and chirality .",
    "moreover , it is showed that all the dots reverse their magnetization via vortex nucleation and propagation , even dots with @xmath103 , which exhibit almost square hysteresis loops .",
    "therefore asymmetry can be used to tailor the magnetic properties of nanostructured magnetic particles for specific applications .",
