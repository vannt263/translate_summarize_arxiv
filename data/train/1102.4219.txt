    "as long as @xmath23 is small , @xmath5 decays almost linearly in @xmath50 , which is also in qualitative agreement with the result ( [ sigma_model ] ) from the rg of the nonlinear @xmath15-model .",
    "for @xmath48 the decay is much slower at small length scales , but , in contrast to the non - linear @xmath15-model where @xmath5 is _ not _ renormalized .",
    "this qualitative difference is due to the following important difference between the heisenberg and the nonlinear @xmath15-model : parametrizing the wlc model ( [ continuous ] ) via tangent angle leaves only quadratic terms @xmath107 , whereas the discrete semiflexible chain ( [ discrete ] ) gives terms @xmath108 , which represent the full expansion of the cosine and obey the local invariance under full rotations .",
    "as @xmath23 increases @xmath35 approaches zero only asymptotically . therefore , the definition of the persistence length as length scale where the renormalized @xmath5 vanishes , @xmath33  which is usually used for fluid membranes  would always give an _ infinite _ result .",
    "we propose not to ask at which length scale the renormalized @xmath5 reaches zero , but rather _ how _ it reaches zero . for @xmath109 the sums in ( [ k_n ] ) converge fast and one has to include only the first few terms for accurate results .",
    "in fact , one can replace the bessel functions contained in the eigenvalues @xmath110 , see ( [ expansions ] ) , by their asymptotic form @xmath111 $ ] for large @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this is justified for sufficiently large @xmath112 , which is fulfilled by semiflexible polymers like f - actin ( @xmath113 ) or dna ( @xmath114 ) . using this asymptotics we find @xmath115 for @xmath48 and @xmath116 for @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , we may expand ( [ k_n ] ) as a power series in @xmath117 and obtain @xmath118 the characteristic length scales in the expansions are @xmath119 in @xmath48 and @xmath120 in @xmath50 , which are , therefore , a natural definition for the persistence length @xmath0 . for general dimensionality @xmath13 , the exponent of the first term is determined by the order of the bessel function appearing in the eigenvalue .",
    "thus the rg calculation leads to a persistence length @xmath121 which agrees exactly with the result ( [ tangent ] ) based on the tangent correlation function .",
    "our definition based on the large - scale asymptotics of the exact rg flow is qualitatively different from the definition ( [ persistence_sigma ] ) used in perturbative rg calculations .",
    "while the result ( [ sigma_model ] ) from the nonlinear @xmath15-model is only valid for small length scales @xmath122 , where @xmath35 is close to @xmath12 , the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) describes the region @xmath123 .",
    "indeed , taking the expansion of ( [ k_n ] ) for @xmath122 , that is @xmath124 and defining @xmath0 by the exponential decay length in two dimensions , respectively , by the linear term in three dimensions leads to a persistence length , which is considerably bigger than the value ( [ persistence_heisenberg ] ) found above .",
    "hence it is not surprising that the two computations ( [ sigma_model ] ) and ( [ expansion ] ) yield different results .",
    "the slow exponential decay in the expansion ( [ expansion1 ] ) for @xmath48 is reminiscent of the non - renormalization of @xmath5 in the non - linear @xmath15-model , see eq .",

    "in conclusion we have presented a definition of the persistence length @xmath0 of a semiflexible polymer or one - dimensional fluid membrane based on the large scale behaviour of the rg flow of the bending rigidity @xmath5 , as obtained from a functional real - space rg calculation .",
    "our result ( [ persistence_heisenberg ] ) for @xmath0 generalizes the conventional definition based on the exponential decay of a particular two - point tangent correlation function and gives identical results for @xmath0 , thus justifying past experimental and theoretical work based on this conventional definition . the rg flows ( [ k_n ] ) or ( [ expansion ] ) allow us to follow the behaviour of a semiflexible polymer from a stiff polymer on short length scales to an effectively flexible polymer on large length scales quantitatively as a function of the length scale . on large length scales ,",
    "our functional rg gives qualitatively different results from perturbative rg techniques , which have been used for the closely related problem of fluid membranes @xcite and which we also applied to the one - dimensional semiflexible polymer .",
